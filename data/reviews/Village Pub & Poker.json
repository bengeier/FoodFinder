{"text":"This place has great food and friendly bartenders.i try to come here at least once a week for happy hour. 10 great wings for about 4 bucks is just awesome. Addictive I tell ya! I come graveyard hours. Damn near empty at that time. Nobody is ever way too drunk n sloppy."}
{"text":"My husband and I only come here when Rory is working! We love the food, but more importantly the great service and friendliness from Rory!"}
{"text":"Well the food is good as usual, but some of the wait staff sure walk around with a scrowl on their face their whole shift !  If that unhappy they should just stay home!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is Fantastic and the Bartenders are very friendly! The only downside here is the winnings! Not enough for sure =)"}
{"text":"When I was new to the area we were looking for a neighborhood bar and we decided to try village pub. Boy are we happy we have it a shot! The food is great and so is service we love our bartender Christina she is always great and makes us feel so welcomed now that we have moved we still take the drive all the way to this place keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Nice local feel in Vegas. As a self proclaimed expert on chicken pot pies, it was the second best. Pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I can't see how anyone gives this place any stars other than for the friendly staff.  I have to say the food here was one of the worst we have eaten.  The grease was so much my stomach was sick for a couple of days.  I personally will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Wishing I could say something nice about eating here. I got the chicken teriyaki which had a slice of canned pinapple and some sauce over that. Vegitables seemed to have been cooked in a microwave, they were rubber. Only 1 1/2 servers for the place.  They'll never have me darken their doorway."}
{"text":"I only give a one because the door opened and toilet worked other than that ugh!!! Just because you change the name of the place it doesn't make it better! The tall guy with the go-t was a jerk. He stared at my friends boobs the whole conversation. And when my friend showed no interest in him he gave us horrible service. I have been there alone several times before they changed the name and it was fine now what a waste. And the same jerk worked there before too."}
{"text":"My first time ever coming here...the place is big lots of machines! The bartender Rob is super friendly and makes a delicious drink!!! I Will come back because of the great service from him!"}
{"text":"Wow.... I just got charged for a coke back with my tequila shot....... I'm sorry but, huh? Are you kidding me? Lisa..... that's the dumbest thing I've ever encountered! Don't be surprised when your tip is zero! I've been in this industry for way to long and have NEVER been charged for a coke back. Wow... just wow."}
{"text":"This place is located close to our house and if you get past the dated decor has some good food.  The prices are very reasonable and in my experiences the staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome! Enough said. Ribs are fantastic, and the fish and chips are the best I've had in a long time. atmosphere is old school and so are prices - very reasonable!!!! Happy hour wine for $2.50!!! Old Vegas local place."}
{"text":"Been coming to this Village Pub for years.  It's my favorite one.  I've had most items on the menu.  My go-to is the Sirloin steak special. You get a soup or salad to start, Sirloin steak with choice of potato and veggies.  It's usually spot on and if you order fries, you get thick steak fries.  The salad is usually crisp and the ranch dressing is great.  Fish and chips are really good.  Service is usually really good.  I would say it's been the most consistent restaurant I've been to for the past 16 years.   Some tips, expect to come out smelling like smoke.  The bar is inside as well and this location has no real separation. You won't come out smelling like and ash tray but it's like walking through a casino, it will get on your clothes.  I'm a non-smoker in Las Vegas; you get used to it.  The food is worth it. I've never hung out at the bar here but it usually seems packed which is a good sign it's also good."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders in town. My girlfriend and I can eat them twice a week. And have for a few months!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of my favorite hang out! The food here is amazing! There is no other word for it. It is just consistently good. Service can be hit or miss, but I try to go on Weekday nights and sit at the bar where Roland works, he's our favorite! The happy hour deals here are outrageous! Half priced appetizers (which are basically meals) 12 wings for $4?!?! And they are the best damn wings around! The fish and chips are incredible and only $10. This is owned by Ellis island so they have their delicious beers and root beer. I love the country friend steak, it's like $6. (Also they must make their own ranch because it is like crack!) Overall this place is just somewhere I know I can go 24 hours a day whether it's 12pm or 5am  and get really good food for $10 or less!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and very friendly wait staff.  They have a nice selection of American style foods. We had 2 young teens with us and everyone found something on the menu they wanted to eat. They brew their own beer an root beer.  Delicious  and free  refills for the kids"}
{"text":"15-20 years ago this place was awesome I went there recently for breakfast and ordered Eggs Benedict and was very very disappointed the hollandaise sauce was not prepared correctly I have not been back since"}
{"text":"been here several times looking for a neighborhood bar. this is not it. very cliqueish gamers who are not very welcoming. they all seem to know each other but are not anywhere near friendly to those not in their little group. kinda like high school except with 60 year olds. funny.can't recommend."}
{"text":"Ok... this is a great place to go for a full meal at extremely reasonable prices when you need a home-style meal. Very old school menu, steaks, mashed, fries, salad, green beans, fish & chips, etc, but it is all consistently good, including service (very friendly staff) and the steaks are really good. I had a shrimp and steak dinner and so did my dining companion, which was very tasty and neither of us could finish. Gets pretty crowed at 5pm for the silver-set diners, but otherwise pretty quiet and very low key. A sister restaurant to Ellis Island Casino, they still have the local $8.99 steak dinner minus the beer or root beer that is include at Ellis."}
{"text":"I originally came to this place because it's right around the corner from my office, and I heard from several co-workers that it was good.  Well I have some news, it wasn't good it was more like great!   I ended up looking at the menu over and over because there were just so many choices that not only sounded good but when I looked around at other tables the food complimented the yummy smell. I got the sliders because I love me some finger foods that I can pick up real quick, eat, and go. I also got a root beer float-that was also fantastic.  The only thing that I could say that could have been better was the service. I picked out what I wanted fairly quick, and between the time of sitting down and placing my order was around 10 minutes, which normally isn't so bad during lunch except that the restaurant was not busy by any means-like it was pushing 3 other tables, and 1 of them was paying.   The food makes up for the service though. If you're in a time crunch make sure to ask for the bill right away, because it still takes a while to get."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, prices very reasonable, friendly n good food! Excellent service and very fast!"}
{"text":"Great food. The amount of food is beyond the price you pay. Service is excellent and friendly.. our waitress was Michelle and she is the best!!!  Better than average prices.  This was our first time and will be our go to place from this point forward."}
{"text":"I used to love going here for the late night happy hour but they stopped doing that so I no longer go here."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for a while and decided to get some food to go.  Fish and chips was good.  Wings tasted like they had been cooked in old oil and the French Dip was horrible - the meat was as tough as shoe leather!  Will NOT eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of grabbing a drink at the Village Pub while in Vegas. Our server Danny way the man!"}
{"text":"Since last month it has been horrible here. Word is management has new workers here and it is not the same. Sad to hear some great workers will no longer be here. Service is slow and food no longer is good! Won't be giving my business to this bar anymore!"}
{"text":"Horrible service from the lady named Carol.   I always go there to eat like almost every week. The waitress always acted stupid to me because I used to yell at her about her service. After that I got over because I wanted to enjoy my meal. Sometime I know they are very busy because people keep coming I understand that. But nice service can clam customers down for waiting for the food you know. When I got the food and after that she never came back to check or asked if I would like anything else she got the check and put on the table. She refilled my aunts coffee and spilled on the table like she hates her job. I don't know ... She always pissed me off.  I would love to go there more if Brandon and David are working. They are the best. I love the food so much. 4 stars for food. I love their food very much. I always get the vegetable omelette and steak and egg. Reasonable prices and good portions :)"}
{"text":"This Village Pub has gotten so much better now that Michelle is a server. She is on the ball, friendly and gets your good out fast.  Great steak and egg breakfast for $6 99 on weekends."}
{"text":"We love our neighborhood Village Pub. Service is always friendly and prompt. The dinners we order are always good, Never have been disappointed. Very worthwhile. I like the fact the bar is separate from the dinning room so no smoke."}
{"text":"I have eaten here consistently and their food is very good. Great deals on appetizers from 3-6. For the money you get great food."}
{"text":"I just want to say how impressed I am by the level of service at this restaurant. I am currently eating here with my mom and this obnoxious lady was in here causing a problem. She was targeting our waitress Arlene specifically for no reason. Instead of acting like a grown up this rude lady berated the whole restaurant with her loud voice, cursing, and her over the top descriptions of how poor the service is. It was getting out of hand and I was about to say something but the manager handled the whole situation professionally and asked her kindly to leave. The whole restaurant cheered. Thank you for taking or dining experience into consideration. I really appreciate it! Arlene and the staff here are great. :)"}
{"text":"Great location with super friendly staff! Personally served by the Manager, Billy who was very attentive with our food and service! We ordered a cup of the Chicken Potato Soup which was creamy,  chunky, and flavorful. We followed up our meal with the \" most popular item on the menu,\" the Fish and Chips! The three large battered pieces of fish were fresh, very flavorful, and were served on a bed of steak fries with tartar sauce and a lemon Wedge! Such a large portion for the price that I could only eat a third of it but, took the rest home to enjoy later."}
{"text":"Another great meal, great service and good food I come here for the Top Sirloin meal so cheap and good. I come here a couple of times per week."}
{"text":"Of all of the Village Pubs, this location is the best. We have been dining here for almost 7 years. The food is excellent as is the service. I have never had a bad experience here and the food is consistent in quality. Nice atmosphere and very clean. The prices  are very reasonable and the servers care about customer service. Will be back."}
{"text":"From the staff to the \"regulars,\" this is by far the best place in town. The food is terrific, the staff (particularly John, the manager) treat you like family, and you can't beat the value."}
{"text":"Best bar food in town!! Hamburgers are amazing, fried shrimp specials on Friday are amazing, Angus sliders amazing, meatball sliders amazing, Cobb salad add chicken fingers amazing.  Fish and chips amazing.  Just really great food at a good price. Won't be disappointed.  Been going to this one and other Village Pub's in town for over 10 years. Our favorite comfort food spot!"}
{"text":"If you like cheap eats and tired of fast food they do a good job. The chicken pot pie is always a fav. The waitress is very attentive"}
{"text":"Great staff, food is good, gaming is ok, and we love the area. :) won a few royals here and we love the free play!!! Thanks village people!!!"}
{"text":"Raul is the f*^%%g man! Best bartender ever! Great drinks great service. RAUL 4 PRESIDENT!!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a couple of years and finally decided to try it yesterday. I was jonesing for some fish and chips and these didn't disappoint. Loved that the server offered me Malt Vinegar without asking. I ordered a side salad and it was very reminiscent of the kind I used to get at the local diner in high school, 100+ years ago. I am looking forward to going back for breakfast and can guarantee that it will be better than my recent experience at Ihop(sigh.....)"}
{"text":"There is a person working at Village Pub that needs to be sacked immediately.  Yesterday me and two friends joined a party of three other friends at Village Pub on Sunset sometime around 8.30pm. When we arrived and sat down in the bar to order some bar snacks and beers we were incredibly rudely advised to move to a table instead of sitting in the bar since we were not gambling. I could have understood this if there were a lack of machines, but there was NO ONE in the bar.   Apart from us there were one other group of people in the whole place.   We sat down at the table and got some food and drinks, trying to ignore the horrible bartender. We were chatting away and having a good time and laughing. This is NOT acceptable behavior at the Village Pub.  Without any kind of warning the bartender took our food and drinks and threw us out for being \"too loud\".  I still don't really understand what happened. We are all in our mid-thirties, we were sober and properly dressed.  I wil never visit this Village Pub again (the one on Eastern is good, for example!) and I will make sure to tell everyone I know of what a horrible experience I had here.   You, rather tall, dark-haired bartender, working on Sunday night the 16th of September 2012 - I hope that taking out your personal problems on your customers for no reason whatsoever will cause you to lose your job. You are a horrible person and should not work with people ever again."}
{"text":"Last night we were going to try a new place, went in and sat for 15 min never getting a drink. So leaving was a easy choice decided to come here to the village pub. As we walked in we were greeted right away.  Chris,  the bartender got us 2 beer's.  Asked if we wanted to see the menu. He then struck up a conversation with us. Wow the concept someone walks into a bar,  you greet them, get them drinks and then actually take a min and ask \"how's your day\". Thanks Chris.  And we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Village Pub locations since 2001, this is the closest one to me now, so I go here every now and again.  The food quality to price ratio is what bumps this joint up to five stars for me. If you want to compare this place to a fine steak house it might not fare so well, but when you can get a steak for under ten dollars that is just as good as Outback I think it's a score. The fish and chips are great and the best I have had in town by far (and I'm originally from Seattle). They come beer battered, crispy, and in a generous portion. Breakfast is great here too with lots of options.  Another thing I like is they have some lighter options on the menu if you're watching calories - not something you see too often at a pub/video poker place. They have some great salads for lunch and dinner, full meals with healthy side options, and egg white omelettes at breakfast time - and a lot of this stuff of under 10 bucks. Can't beat it.  As a bonus they have a selection of micro brews from Ellis Island Casino that are very good.  I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and even for a late night meal on the graveyard shifts. The staff has always been good, friendly, and attentive. The best locals bar food for the price, and still great without factoring the price."}
{"text":"Normally my mom and I get great service here, but today it was anything but that. We never got our straws. She said she would refill my coffee and never happened. I had to ask the gal that took us to our seats for my cofee."}
{"text":"I have been to The Village Pub at this location several times.  I'm not quite a regular but I'm close to being a regular.  I always eat in the bar area even though I don't smoke because of the big screen t.v.'s.  It doesn't matter what shift I walk into the place on the bartenders greet me by name and by the time I have a seat at the bar my drink is waiting for me.  They remember what I eat as an appetizer and how I like it ordered.  I have had several items on the menu and all have been really good.  As far as bar food goes this place has it right.  Great food very good pricing and most importantly an amazing staff that seem to be happy at work.  A few food items I've had and loved the Chicken pot pie, chicken wings, philly steak sandwich, and the breakfast special."}
{"text":"Certainly a dive bar that needs a major update. Place hasn't been updated in over 15 year (when I first visited and 15 years ago it wasnt even nice.. lol) and it certainly shows as soon as you walk in the door.  However, this place is the Old School Vegas type bar that doesn't nickel and dime you to death like so many of the newer places so that's a plus. Food is decent for the price but there has been times you can't get a late night bite to eat. Draft beer selection is bad...   There are several much better choices in the immediate area for a good cold draft beer and good food at a great price... that are clean.  Surprisingly, this place is located in an upscale area but you wouldn't know it being inside.   Oh yeah.. don't talk to any of their gambleholics that keep their doors open because the bartenders get pissed off. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, and nice and cool!  Prices were very reasonable.  We had both dinner and breakfast here and will return the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is our little hide out when we need a break from work! Great food, great service, fun little games on the slots after 12pm, but it will never be the same. WITHOUT MARY HERE!!!!!! We miss you Mary!!!"}
{"text":"I gave a one since there was no way to give less.  Waited over 45 minutes to even get salads. Ordered breakfast eggs came cold. Second one came out microwaved and overcooked. Second dish was chicken fried steak. Potatoes  and gravy came cold, second came slightly microwaved. Third dish was shrimp, got a few steak fries, shrimp was good, coleslaw was warm and wilted. Vegetables hard from being over-nuked. Definitely will not be back to this location. Now I know why the location is slow, it's due to lack of business..."}
{"text":"I live around the corner so I thought I would give this place a try.   I've been to the bar twice and both times Donna Jo was working the bar. She's nice enough but her service is poor. First time I was there the bar was busy. I get it. I sat there with an empty drink for awhile but she had plenty of other customers so she gets a pass. Still gave a decent tip because I won.  I come in again during happy hour. The bar is practically empty, only 3 other patrons. Again I'm sitting there with empty drinks. Ok so she's busy, nope, she is sitting there smoking a cigarette. We finally walked over to her and asked for another round. Apparently, if you're not a regular, you don't matter.  I am giving this place 2 stars because the food is yummy. If only the service was great it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty fast service during the hours I'm there. Oscar is the best!!! The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"If you are under the age of 50 and do not plan on playing bar poker, you might as well skip this place. Three friends and myself were bribed with free drinks twice in order to persuade us to first leave the bar and sit at a table, and finally to leave the establishment entirely.  The first time we were displaced was because we were not playing video poker. Fine. We moved to a table, ate dinner, and went back to the bar for one more drink before heading out.   Of the two bartenders on duty (it was not busy), the first acted as though he had no time for us. Thankfully the second grabbed our drinks. We began talking at a reasonable volume as friends often do at the bar. No sooner had we taken a few sips of our drinks, we were asked to lower our voices. Mind you, we were speaking at a normal volume with occasional rises for inflection.   We began wondering aloud why we were asked to silence ourselves and the bartender immediately walked over and in a rude manner offered to comp our drinks if we would just leave.   If you enjoy hopping all around the bar to play multiple video poker machines, speaking only at a whisper, this place may be ideal. However if you enjoy a few drinks and conversing with friends without gambling, spend your money at one of the numerous other bars on Sunset."}
{"text":"(8) of us went to dinner last night at the Village Pub to have Fish & Chips.  The fish was delicious and the chips were okay.  The Fish & Chips meal comes with (3) pieces of Fish which is plenty, you may not be able to finish it all, most of us didn't.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"We come here for the cheap happy hour drinks and wings. My favorite from the menu is the Cobb salad. I order it with the house vinegar dressing and lemon wedges on the side. Its the best traditional Cobb salad in the city!"}
{"text":"Never again.  Initial entering the dinning area was a bit smoky.  Busboy was great, but the waitress and cook messed up the order.  Did not receive an apology nor offered to correct the mistake after it was mentioned to the waitress.  Waitress even gave the wrong change back afterwards.  Food and price was decent.  Place & patrons have a mellow, depressing mood... not recommended if you want to enjoy your meal.  Other village pubs were much better!"}
{"text":"They serve great fish and chips here, not as good as I've eaten in northern California, but definitely--so far--the best I've had in Las Vegas. Also, they make an outstanding chicken pot pie. I definitely recommend both these dishes. A friend sampled the chili and told me it  was OK, though definitely not anything special.  This particular location also serves other draft beers aside from the Ellis Island brews, which lack the robustness of really good microbrewed beers.  All in all, a good place for a pint, some fish and chips, or maybe a chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"The bartenders here are horrible. I had 2 drinks within 2 hours, and they decided to cut me off. The bartender replied that he did not know what else was going on with me. Not that it is any of his business, but I just got off work, and wanted to have a few drinks with my Co Workers."}
{"text":"Football food and drinks  Wonderful meatball sliders Robin is a wonderful bartender 1 place"}
{"text":"While the food continues to be wonderful,  the service continues to be horrible.   Because we get such bad service in the restaurant,  we sat at the bar.  On a Sunday night with only 4 others at the bar, we were ignored completely.   After our first drink order, we ordered food.  The order was wrong. After 5 minutes my husband had to get the bartender from the other side of the bar because she was focused on 1 male customer. The order was fixed, but we were never offered drink refills and we both ate our entire meal without a beverage.   Service at this location is always poor.   Even sitting at the bar we were treated to some of the worst service i have received at this location.  This female bartender has no idea about customer service and follow up.  It's a shame the food is so good, because the service standards are lower than poor."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the restaurant with my family. It is very reasonably priced and the food is always good, friendly staff no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"Just moved to Desert Shores and we like to find the nearest pub and use it as our local haunt. The food is really great, they have daily specials and the drinks are not expensive. It's best described as a high class dive, the décor is dated but they have many gambling machines. The staff are very efficient but not friendly."}
{"text":"Try the cobb salad. It's fantastic. A bit dreary inside, very dark, but the food makes up for the lack of atmosphere. Great place for breakfast too."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Village Pub...it's just that, pub food. It's the right price, it's nothing fancy, no frills or thrills. You can go there in your gym clothes or sweats and a hoodie. It's the perfect beer and fried food kind of place, and works great in a \"I really don't feel like cooking but I don't want to shell out a lot of cash to eat out\" kind of place.   Good points  1. cheap draft beer  2. Jumbo Fried Shrimp, YUM!  3. BLT (make sure you add avocado and get it on Sourdough)  4. Fish n Chips  5. their ranch is tasty  6. steak fries, my fave kind of fry  7. if we don't drink too much we can get out of there for about $30 for the two of us  8. consistent with the food quality and portions   Negatives  1. this location has a very noisy HVAC fan or something that kicks on and off and makes a ridiculous noise. Kind of annoying but you can drown it out with conversation and numb the pain with inexpensive draft beer.  2. salad = iceberg lettuce (not such a bad thing if you are expecting it)  3. sometimes the service and the kitchen are a teeny bit slow. But it's a pub, so drown the thought in beer.  4. corny ship paintings   Thanks Village Pub for consistent, inexpensive pub food. Yum."}
{"text":"The place you want to visit in Vegas. Great food great service. Can't think of a better way to spend the evening. The bartender was great. Can't remember his name. 3-11-2016 at 9pm was his shift. A must for locals and tourist."}
{"text":"Regular visitors for years. Food only for us...no machines.  Like the room and the food. Must be good value as it always filled with seniors."}
{"text":"Came here early afternoon last week to catch a World Cup playoff. Sat in dining area which had a nice flat screen TV.  Ordered fish and chips and a Newcastle.  Waitress was very pleasant and efficient. Food arrived promptly and highly recommend the F&C!  Newcastle was frosty cold, served with a chilled glass.    Nothing not to like here!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Chris the bartender (bald) is a jackass, and rude. Tells me that since I'm driving for my wife so her friends and her can drink, that I'm whipped. Then tries to be funny and makes little bad jokes and won't give me food unless I stand up for myself. Then I order food and when I say give my soup to the wife he makes another lame, anti women jokes. Food took forever to get and when food is brought only two items are brought out, and mine isn't brought or mentioned. I watch others who came in after us get their food. After about 10 minutes he says I'm checking on your chicken parmigiano. Tell me it will be 2 minutes. I watch others in restaurant get food and I wait more. The others in my party have finished their food. So after about 45 minutes I tell the other bartender to cancel my order. Chris comes out and tells me he's taking off the bill. Then tells me the restaurant is packed and the bar too, sounds like he's blaming me, not once does he offer a sorry about the food situation . I won't be back and I'm calling management on him. Worse service, and he's a jackass"}
{"text":"Cheap cheap and cheap! The average beer of their brew brand is $3.50!! The menu of food looked tasty too but we didn't order any. If you are looking for a hip and fun environment this isn't the place. It is a chill local spot with cheap drinks and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food. Super friendly and nice bartenders.  Very smoky in the bar area and very dark. Not a place I would bring company to impress them if in town. But a good \"townie bar\""}
{"text":"I enjoy having breakfast here. There is never any wait. The staff is friendly. They offer daily specials which includes the steak and eggs for only $6.99. The steak is prepared to your liking, 2 eggs, potatoes, and toast, You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Wow. You will NOT leave this place hungry. I made the mistake of getting chili soup and the chicken pot pie. I could barely walk out when dinner was through! The food is good, very filling and a good friend of mine swears by the ribs (she and her son come here once a week for rib night ;) ). Service was friendly. Come here on empty, because you will live with a little more than full tank."}
{"text":"I may have grown just a bit too picky to fully appreciate the dive experience any longer.  The Pub certainly has the dive feel to it - red vinyl booths have a few tears and are quite rump-sprung.  The surly busser gave way to a very friendly, casual server. I started with wings and they were great - just what I want with wings.  I sampled their Pale Ale brew and it was delicious.  The dining room wasn't very full, but there was quite a wait before our main course arrived: Smokehouse Burger for me.  The burger itself was delicious, cooked properly, juicy and nice accompaniments....Except for the fries.  The menu said \"Seasoned Steak Fries\", but they weren't even salted.  And you know you have to salt the fries when they are fresh out of the fryer or it won't stick. The burger bun was nice and fresh, but didn't hold up and by the two-thirds point started falling apart. I would be happy to have the wings again, but the dining room was quite smoky.  Even though the smoking was only allowed in the bar area, it is a small restaurant and they needed some ceiling fans or something.  By the end of my meal I left smelling of smoke myself."}
{"text":"Great service from the first bartender (didnt catch her name) and her relief,Alex was also cool. :) Great svc nice convo.. Had a chicken wrap~awesome! & the fries were the best ever (perfect temp perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Wow!..it was like MIDnight! I was so impressed with the quality of food (and esp since it was so late) and the price and the location. This place is a hit every time!! :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast all day... everyday... new york steak and eggs for cheap and good... not a problem... not to mention a side of blueberry pancakes... If I'm not at Green Valley Buffet, I'm usually here... the prices are great, and the food is plentiful... and I get to eat breakfast for lunch and dinner if I want... I can't tell you how the other foods are... I come here to get my breakfast fix in... and it usually includes steak..."}
{"text":"It's not a fancy place and a bit old fashioned with no windows, which I found strange. However, the food was good. I really liked the fish & chips, and the french fries weren't bad. Another time I had the pot pie. It was also very good, but, as another reviewer said, it did have too many peas. If they cut back on them, it would be perfect. Also, it only had crust on the top, so I guess you could consider it healthier since it would have less calories. One suggestion is that they could work more on their slow service. I'm willing to give them a pass on my rating because they were friendly and the food was good at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"2 ships for the unique interior.  Ships adorn the walls and you can sit comfortably in one of the several red pleather booths.  If I was to dine here again, I definitely would have parked my rear in the bar.  That place was semi packed with locals enjoying an early dinner and beverages."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the bad food reviews, but everything I've had here is delicious. Onion rings, potato skins, ribs, and chicken pasta were fabulous. Robert, the bartender has my drink up before I sit down and it never gets empty. Also had good luck on the machines here unlike PTs. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Update: Weekend special is back! $6.99 steak and eggs!  We used to love the steak & egg weekend special. $6.99 and always delicious. They raised price $9.49. It's always smokey but we didn't mind for the price & quality of food. Don't think we'll be back again even though it's consistently good food & service, since now I don't feel the value matches the quality of experience."}
{"text":"I come here for the pretty decent $6 steak and eggs breakfast. It comes with toast and potatoes on the side. The steak is decent quality. Obviously you're not going to get a steakhouse quality but for $6, it was not bad at all. Potatoes are not dry. Service is also pretty good. Attentive and quick. Went here around 11AM and the place was empty so it was pretty nice not having to deal with a lot of people. I also like how I didn't have the hassle the waiter for hot sauces as they were already available on each table. The only thing that was a bit bothersome to me was that the whole establishment smelled like cigarettes but I suppose that's understandable since it is a pub. I will come back again and again when I am craving for steak and eggs in the mornings."}
{"text":"Our second kitchen. We are here at least once a week. The food is great at most Village Pub locations, but this specific one is special. Kathy the manager really cares and is sure to welcome new customers and stop to chat with regulars to make you feel welcome. The service is consistently great, and a lot of the staff has been there for years so you know it's a good team. The prices are very reasonable and the ribs are back to normal and are excellent again! I also love the Village Pub Chicken, the Pot Pie, the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, the Club Sandwich, the Steak & Shrimp, the Ham Steak & Eggs, the Fish & Chips - oh and the burgers. The burgers are so good. ...and now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. They had great happy hour specials. The food is good, and I think their home brew is very good. However, since they have removed all happy hour specials, I realized their goal was just to have gamblers patronize their establishment. I've completely stopped going.  I'll give them their wish."}
{"text":"Great place to eat very friendly staff ,The ribs are the bomb and breakfast is great If you eat there They will  Take good care of you also on wednesday try the soup  Of the day its great"}
{"text":"Still to go fee. SMH. Not good for business. Not only that you can't even place orders for pick up. I don't come here much at all cause of the drive and getting not so affordable. Mgmt needs to wake up."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside - darkened window facade in a small plaza but decent enough inside.  The bar area is glass enclosed so it keeps the smoke out of the main dining area.  They brew their own beer which is pretty good.  Menu has a good variety of foods.  I had some salmon it was good.  Service was quick and friendly and prices reasonable.  Nothing fancy but won't break the bank either.  I frequently stay at a hotel nearby so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was heading to Vegas with a group of 3 other people for a concert. We decided we wanted to stop and eat somewhere before heading to the stadium. I had yelped this pub and read all the reviews, we all agreed this was the place. Great decision. We got there about 5-5:30 pm, on a Friday night, and the place was pretty much empty, except of course for the bar. We seated ourselves, were greeted quickly and given our menus. Prices were fantastic, but when I ordered a Guinness, the server had no idea what I was talking about. I had the Chicken Parm Panini. It was HUGE! Next time, I know to split a meal with someone else. Another member of our party had the Chicken Caesar Panini, also huge, and delicious. Penne pasta also looked fantastic.   Over all, good food, good prices, huge portions. Nice quiet restaurant, decent service."}
{"text":"Prime rib for medium rare got it medium well,  service is good just can't what you ask for"}
{"text":"Great food Friday night special $8.99 with the best clam chowder around.  We come here every time we park and fly"}
{"text":"Great bar food. Friendly service, never disappointed....hash and eggs. Great, sweet potato tots good....your welcome"}
{"text":"I love The Village Pub, don't get me wrong. The one star is due to their change for happy hour menu. Always enjoyed half price appetizers as well as the great drink prices. Stopped in last week for happy hour, we were informed that happy hour no longer includes food. Unfortunately, this means Village Pub is off the list ( this location anyway)  as a great place to meet friends to enjoy happy hour, dinner and time with friends."}
{"text":"We live in Desert Shore and we have always had good friendly service with very yummy food. (Ribs to die for) For an enjoyable evening park your car and take a walk before or after dinner next to the water.....very nice."}
{"text":"This is amazing. Great staffs and food. We get treated like family every time we walk in. Ions the service and the food."}
{"text":"I normally eat the steak sirloin at Village Pub.  You get large portion for the price.  They offer different  daily special like half baked chicken, pot roast, prime rib, corned beef, roast turkey& more.  The staff here is friendly &  give great service.  Very attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"I have an amazing time any time I go there. Doesn't matter what bartender is there it is always fun. I am mostly there with Nick and Trisa but even Sasha knows me and what i drink even though I don't go there that often. I would suggest it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend(had to convince her to go) and she fell in love with the place! Recommend the Apple cobbler and the California panini. Breakfast was also phenomenal!"}
{"text":"It was a slow night and my first visit to the neighborhood bar and I loved it. Good football specials, awesome bartender(it was Angelia) hope I didn't spell it wrong! Won a little money and I'll be back to see Angelia."}
{"text":"First time stopping in the pub and I must say, I like it. From Angie greeting me as I came in, to the great service! I ordered a beer and it kinda tasted off and I don't normally send stuff back but this time I did. With no question Angie got me another beer with a smile. Food was great as well. I will be back anytime I'm in this area again!! Kudos to Angie! You just don't get service like that in vegas anymore"}
{"text":"Great local brewery!! I had the pleasure of coming into this nice little local spot. At first felt a little Divey , but was pleasantly surprised. Was told to sit anywhere I'd like and my server would be right with me. He was very prompt, and very friendly. I asked about some of the in house brews from Ellis Island brewery, he was very knowledgeable about all the brews and actually what to pair them with. Had an amazing steak dinner for an insanely affordable price. $11.99 for a perfectly cooked steak with delicious sides and had a few beers as well. I will definitely be back for dinner with friends and family. Next time I may even step into the separate bar where I can gamble a bit!! Thank you guys for the great meal and amazing service!!"}
{"text":"For what it is, a neighborhood pub, it gets 5 stars; but it is a neighborhood pub and the food fits -- Had the chicken pot pie which is absolutely great. With that, I recommend it. I have had both breakfast and lunch there; both rank the same way. Worth a shot or two if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just stop by for a quick take out lunch my server Carlos was super friendly and courteous. I order a BLT to go and the sandwich was very very good, plenty of bacon cooked perfectly and came with steak fries my favorite!"}
{"text":"Been coming here with my family for 11 years and Carol the server knows us really well and knows what we want right when we walk in. One of the best places to get steak and eggs. All of the servers are very kind and friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Out of all the Village Pubs I've been too , this is my favorite one by far. The food is great and the bartender Kelly always has incredible service."}
{"text":"Really like Village Pub! Great food, excellent prices. I really like to order a club sandwich but in a wrap with avocado instead of mayo, they make it great every time. I also love their breakfast menu as well."}
{"text":"We went late at night and ordered fish and chips to go. They were great!!!. Also the bartender was very nice and we had avery nice time there. Luv this place"}
{"text":"The waiter/waitress have no clue what is going on.  Waited 10 minutes before I was seated and then once I ordered my happy hour they charged me full price. When asked about why I was charged full price they said they must understood me but I still need to pay. I will never return here or any of there locations again as I thought this place was great before coming here based on word of mouth. Never again."}
{"text":"Who can argue with red upholstered booths? Fish and chips were good to go. Don't expect a fancy dinner place, just sit back and enjoy an off the strip place to cool your heels and give your elbow a rest from the one arm bandits. Reminds me of the supper clubs of old. A place your pops  would take you for a burger while he chatted with his pals."}
{"text":"I LOVE their \"Loaded Skillet\" breakfast. So good. One of my favorite breakfast restaurants"}
{"text":"This is my local pub period!!!!! Yes, they know us by name :)  Danny the manager is super sweet. Julie and Penny are the day dolls and remember me and all my crazy life/stories. Chris the graveyard shift guy is funny and nice. Their food is always right.  Their homemade root beer and Ellis Island homemade drafts are excellent.  As a gamblers bonus player you get your $5 every week or two and when playing, your cocktails are always on the house.  Win or lose, ALWAYS leave a tip $20+ for this staff!  It is smoking in the bar area, so if smoke bothers you, this is not your spot. Busy during games and on weekends.  Slow during the weekdays so if you want a drink and play a little during the day, this is your spot! Especially if you want a fun great convo with the staff. Hubby an I have also sat in the dining area and the waitstaff are very kind.  I love this bar......"}
{"text":"Always good food.    Not a huge fan of bar food anymore.  Maybe because I am getting older, but this is good food.    Steak and eggs - about $9 - decent piece of steak.  Have had the steak and potato before for around $10 - much better cut of beef, but this was very good.  Owned by Ellis Island Casino - so, Ellis Island beers on tap.  Staff friendly.  Go - easy - friendly - serves food 24/7.  Welcome to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went in here to get a charge for a dead phone. Ended up getting a couple of beers and an awesome pot pie plus my charge. Service was great and definitely a value. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends who live near by.  Nice atmosphere,  clean interior/exterior.  Pleasant and polite wait staff.  I had the Fish N Chips.  Wife had the sirloin steak with green beans and garlic mashed potatos.  I absolutely love fish N chips.  But, 9 times out of 10 I am always disappointed.  This place proudly says they dip their fish in their premium beer batter.  It was the weirdest thing.  The batter looked like an ice cream cone.  You could actually pull the white fish out of the deep fried batter.   I found the batter/breading to be to thick for the small amount of fish in it.  I just ate the fish.  The chips/fries were ok, but ....just ok.  The chips directly under the fish were all soggy.  Wife's sirloin steak was under cooked to her medium well preference.  The steak was also kind of dry.  How to you get a dry medium rare steak?  Green beans were delicious.   For the prices they charge, the food should really be better.  Not sure if I'll ever have an occasion to eat here again.  Probably wouldn't if I had the choice."}
{"text":"Best most affordable breakfast in Vegas. I don't like their other meals but breakfast here is where it's at. I went out to breakfast the past 3 days here and spent twice as much at the other places. So for he quality and affordability they deserve 5 stars. This is what Vegas is about, cheap food and booze. Village pub is a staple."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Fish and chips are about the best I have had. But, dissappointing that they don't do phone orders!"}
{"text":"great neighborhood environment, las vegas style pub. great food, homecooked salads and dinners  - annnnd breakfast is real!   thanks for showing us a good time"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a chill atmosphere, a little video poker or keno, good drinks and excellent food, check Village Pub out at 10900 Eastern Ave. in Henderson.  I am a big fan of a good margarita and I make them quite well. I ordered one from the bartender, Sherry, and tried to tell her how I wanted it. She laughed and said \"leave it to the professional\". I laughed a bit and then tasted the best margarita EVER! She uses good tequila and froths it just a bit. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.   My husband and I often stop in after a round of golf to talk golf and baseball with the other bartender, Nick, my husband's favorite bartender in all of Vegas! He loves his job and his positivity shines.   Now, if you are looking for excellent food that is very reasonably priced, this is the right place. We haven't had a bad meal here, and if you really want a treat, get the prime rib. It is by far the best I have ever eaten! Cooked perfectly and tender. Nice smokey flavor too. Paired with the garlic mashed potatoes was quite the treat. My husband had the cream broccoli soup and loved it as well.   So if you're ever in that area I would highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"This is so close to my house I can walk to it.  It is great.  They have a great happy hour that includes sliders for $3 and beer for $2.5.   The service in the restaurant area can be a bit slow but they are always friendly."}
{"text":"I didn't stop and eat but did order a couple of fish & chips dinners to go. Got home and the food was plentiful, fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the meal and will certainly make this a to-go spot for the future. Good food and good service. I got there at 6:20 and the parking was very tight--not to mention scarce."}
{"text":"The food portions are big and for a really great price. The reason for the three stars is for the poor service. Went in earlier this evening with two girlfriends and a total of three children. (We sat in the dining area) didn't seem very busy and there were two servers in the section. As soon as the waitress came over I felt like she was immediately irritated. She was very short with us and didn't seem to want to be bothered with us. We ended up coming to the conclusion it was because we had children with us. But I'm a little perplexed because they have a children's menu so she should be use to having families come in with kids. All three children were well behaved no screaming, crying running around or causing a scene to warrant such coldness. She would walk by and check on the other tables around us and pass us by. We all felt as if we really had to stare her down to come over and then when she would she was gone before we could finish what we were trying to say to her. Disappoints me because it's two min from my house. Maybe I'll try to come back with my husband and leave our son at home. But either way we are paying costumers and had well behaved children. We should have been treated with the same curtesy as the next guest."}
{"text":"This place is clean, neat and quick with ur order. It's worth stopping in. Very friendly staff and never have to wave them down fir refills or anything ejse"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch to try a new place.  I've seen these chains around town and finally had the chance to try it.  We were seated immediately but brought breakfast menus.  Well, it was lunch time.  We had to ask her for the lunch menus.  Not a big deal but strange.  Our drinks were brought out quickly as she took our order.  They were pretty busy sometimes our drinks were empty.  It wasn't too long a wait for our food to be delivered.  I tried their Club House Sandwich with steak fries. The sandwich was loaded with turkey, bacon and the fillings.  It was fine.  They steak fries could have been cooked just a bit longer.  Many of my fries were a bit soggy and didn't really feel the urge to finish them.    Overall the service and food were just ok.  I'm not in a rush to hurry back to try them again."}
{"text":"I was dragged here by a friend who loves this place so much he's here at least weekly. I'd never given the spot a second thought but my interest was piqued and my expectations raised when I found out they are affiliated with Ellis Island, whose food I've really enjoyed. Unfortunately the couple of meals I've had here aren't quite up to that standard.  Steak and egg breakfast was decent, but the chicken fried steak version was overly battered and the breading was soggy rather than crispy. Even more disappointing is how thin their \"country sausage gravy\" was. I added on a side of their garlic green beans and though they smelled amazing, there wasn't much garlic flavor.  Returned for their famous fish and chips dish when working in the area and was similarly underwhelmed by fries that were overdone and a disproportionate fish to breading ratio. They seem to get steady business though, and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Was here on Sunday afternoon for a late brunch. Walked in and was seated fast. Only ordered a fish and chips with some sweet potatoes tots.. everything came out hot and tasty. The wait staff was  great. Water fill up with asking. Asking if we need anything else.. I would say they are top notch."}
{"text":"This is one of the few bar / restaurants I would bring my family and friends. The service is great no complaints. They always check on you. The food is always good. The fish and chips is good and so is the chicken pot pie. The prices are very reasonable. I will be back.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour. Wasn't the greatest I've experienced. Probably will never stop in there again. Had their fish & chips which is supposedly one of their signature items - was super greasy. French fries that came with it were mediocre at best. Extremely smoky inside - thought they would have a better ventilation system. Service was ok."}
{"text":"JUST FABULOUS!  Always love the food here!  Service with a smile and delicious meals no matter what we order.  I never know why it is never crowded though with food this good.  I am always dumfounded but it's my little secret...............a place we always go to because it is so yummy and reasonably priced.  High five!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!  My husband and I come here all of the time.  It's our favorite and the food is always delicious!  It's never crowded though and we don't know why.  We love the service and the prices are fabulous!  You cannot beat the breakfast here, omelets and steak and eggs.  I also love the buffalo wrap and steak, baked potato and green bean dinner.  Fish and chips and Friday night fried shrimp, so delicious!  LUV, LUV, LUV IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. the chicken pot pie the best. if you like fish and chips they are really great too. Their happy hour specials are great for someone on a budget. Most of the wait staff know what they're doing. And if Jamie is in the bar go say hi she makes a really good drink."}
{"text":"Groupon got us again with a great deal! Went here for an event : Paint and Kimvas. What's not fun about painting and drinking?.. Oh and eating! Lol  Sandra R. and I arrived early and seated ourselves at the bar. Bartender approached us right away and we ordered Moscatos, our favorite wine!  I was also a little hungry and decided to order the appetizer chili nachos! We should've been warned that it was mountain high and definitely a must share item!   Our friend finally came, so we went right to the canvases set up (oddly) in the middle of restaurant, where all eyes were on us! We ordered our first, my last, round of cocktails - two Tokyo Teas and a Mai Tai!  My first Tokyo Tea and it's similar to a Midori Sour, I do like my sour drinks and this had that punch without it tasting like alcohol!   Cheap drinks and food at Village Pub, something for the locals to check out! Definitely impressed with my visit and the fun event hosted by Kim! Check out both things!"}
{"text":"Friendly, great food! Happy hour 4-7 and 11pm to I forget. Anyways my onion better than pt's..... always drink specials and good variety of food! Games you actually WIN on! 5 stars all the way and best location."}
{"text":"Service Great Food average, but made better by the service. Old School _ Restaurant_ Tuck Roll Booths. Convenient location. Had breakfast, nothing special just Oatmeal / Bacon/ English Muffin / Coffee very inexpensive."}
{"text":"My wife and i regularly come here for a late dinner. It's a really cozy place but after several visits I have to recommend everyone going late at night to call ahead and make sure Roy is serving. He's always great. The alternate server, I believe his name is chris(heavy set, receding hair and thin facial hair) is incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. He locks the door at night and pretends the place is closed, and makes crass, dirty jokes when socializing with customers. Many occasions we've seen customers become irritated with his serving behavior and some have walked out because of it. Village Pub is a great place but call ahead and make sure Roy is your late night server."}
{"text":"The food here is the reason Village Pub is getting 3-stars. One of the main bartenders did not give my husband and I very good service. She only paid attention to the regulars and hardly asked us how we were doing. Waited with our empty plates for well over 10 minutes before she came back to us. She also made both of us feel incompetent when we asked for a different side because the one we received tasted funny. Not good customer service. We might return of we do not sit at the bar. My husband's steak and my wrap were very good. They only have their beers on tap, so be prepared for that though I've heard they are good."}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at Village Pub on Eastern Avenue, near Anthem.  The spareribs are about the best I've ever had, and a real bargain.  The onion soup was very good, though perhaps not quite so delicious as at previous visits.  One dining companion had the soup of the day--potato and chicken--and declared it top notch.  She also enjoyed the fish and chips, the portion so large it allowed us all to take a taste.    Outstanding service by Samantha, who was patient, personable, and knowledgeable about the menu offerings.  Comfortable, informal atmosphere, a perfect destination for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Village pub is the place I take the wife and kids whenever I feel the need to get out of the house to a place that is semi family friendly and has the best fish and chips and chicken pot pie. The atmosphere is quiet, really quiet. The dining area doesn't have any music playing to lighten up the ambiance but it's kinda fun that way. You can be in a quiet place and only hear the light conversations and the clanking of silverware to flatware."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  My ex wanted to have breakfast here and I said huh?    Breakfast?   I had been here for dinner but had no idea they even had a breakfast menu!      Of course I have always loved coming here, they have the best fish and chips I have ever had!     The menu isnt huge but its satisfying.   I ordered corned beef hash patties w/eggs, toast, potatoes and sausage Patties, the portions are HUGE.    $6.49 for my meal by the way and you would think the food would not be that good for that price but nope, delicious!  He ordered a Ham steak breakfast, the ham (of course I tried a bite) was melt in your mouth!  The restaurant is clean, comfortable, quiet.    The waiter we had was great, kept coming back to fill up the coffee and I ordered a pink lemonade and asked if I could take the rest home with me and he brought me a brand new one.   :)  Will return as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Sunday Brunch place. Tried to get in to Craft Kitchen but found a 40 minute wait. With the stomach growling, no way am I going to make it 40 minutes before sitting down to order. We walked across the parking lot to Village Pub. We were able to get a table with no wait! Service was excellent. Our server, Jeremy, was at our table almost immediately with the menus and to take our drink orders. I opted for the Veggie omelet. A 3 egg omelet for only $7. Now that's a deal. I added avocado for an extra $1.25 and substituted fruit for the side of potato (another $2 add on). The omelet was outstanding!!! My wife and friends each chose a make your own omelet. Also very reasonably priced at $6 plus a small charge for each additional item. Everyone loved their brunch. Gripe: my toast came out cold (gave me a reason not to eat the extra carbs, so it was a good thing). There are a ton of breakfast/brunch places that have opened in this area recently. Most are cuter and hipper. But for quality of the food and value for your buck, none have Village Pub beat. I will be back."}
{"text":"I like this place - they serve well and properly.  The chairs are nice and lots of seats. The food amazing to say least! Location not the best for me but the server and drinks and people are good!  I wish I could live closer to thus place and enjoy the food special and happy hours!  If you want real good food you should go to this place but they don't do take over the phone, which sucks.   According to the servers a bunch of people order meal and never show up which trickled down to bartender - which suck!"}
{"text":"I love it when I sit down and the bartender hands me my drink and says welcome back.  I don't come often, but every time I do, Robert is so prompt, I am not even fully in my chair and my drink is in front of me.  That is what I call hospitality.  Thank you for the stellar service."}
{"text":"We are regulars here eating dinner a few nights a week and breakfast on Saturday. Great menu, decent prices, good portions and the ribs are amazing! Smoke free restaurant which we love since some places still allow smoking. Give it a try and it will become your second kitchen too!"}
{"text":"ridiculous that I can't order, and go pick up a sandwich. I've never had this happen at any restaurant. I prefer to order and take food home because I hate smelling cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Great food -- great service!!   I will definitely be back.     Party of four, fish and chips- excellent; orange roughy - delicious; chicken fried Chicken - delicious - steak and baked potato - perfect.    Great place to eat-- great service"}
{"text":"This is a review about the Village Pubs Restaurants. I am writing in special reference to the Village Pub on Gipson Road in Henderson. I had been going to Village Pubs since the 1970's and loved there food. When I went to the Gipson Village Pub recently I experienced the waitress from HELL!  I was there with my family and we wanted to watch the NBA basketball games on the TV. I first asked the Hispanic waitress to put on the game and she said, \"When I get around to it, you'll get it!\"  After 5-10 min. waiting I went into the bar area and asked the barmaid to change the channel and was informed, \"Your waitress will change it for you!\"  So I sat down and waited and with 2 min. to go in our meal the waitress changed the channel, but it was not the basketball game! (another sport's channel) The waitress kept giving me dirty looks and I decided to speak to the Village Pub  management to find out why we were treated that way. I was informed by Danny (Management) that their pub had a priority to gamblers and  sports fans wanting to watch TV was secondary. I wasnot pleased with that answer and went to Ellis Island Casino the parent company of the Village Pubs. After trying to push my way into their corporate offices to speak to someone in charge I spoke to the new Marketing Manager and was assured she would look into the matter. I am now waiting weeks for an answer, but I hear nothing from Ellis Island Management. I guess I will take my sports dollars to another casino that appreciates their customers. We eat out every night for dinner and we spend a lot of money on food and drink. I guess Ellis Island / Village Pub wants only BIG gamblers and could care less about avid sports fans. GOODBYE VILLAGE PUBS!"}
{"text":"$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ This restaurant has great food and prices!  WARNING: If your waitress is CONCEPTION DO NOT HAVE HER SERVE YOU!  She is loud, rude and puts the customer LAST. We went to eat there and when I asked her to put on the NBA PLAYOFFS she ignored me, but finally she  put the Game on when I was finished with my meal. Ask for another waitress or leave because the BITCH will do you wrong! Spend your valuable $$$$$ not with the WAITRESS FROM HELL! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"}
{"text":"My grandparents brought us in since it's near their house and we all wanted a big meal. My grandma made it clear that the atmosphere inside was too dull for her taste. I would have to agree. It's very quiet and everyone in there is on the older side. If you're expecting a pub atmosphere you'll be let down. The servers were slow but nice.  The food is pretty good, though. I'm all about salad and the Cobb salad actually filled me up! It was huge and packed with the fillings. Almost everyone else in the group got ribs. The plate looked giant but everyone was able to finish. They got an average rating for tastiness."}
{"text":"Had a coupon. Basic old person food. Not good beer. Very slow service. The coupon  was supposed to be for 20 dollars of free slot play. Bartender couldn't figure it out so we had to pay 2 bucks AND she only gave us 15. And pro life bumper stickers in the parking lot, if that tells you of the geriatric clientele. Never again."}
{"text":"Always great service, Ismael has is very friendly and knows what we want.  Food is good and priced right.  Since we do frequent this establishment we would love to see their menu change a bit.   New items to choose from.  Other than that.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best food of any pub I know of. The bartenders are an awesome group. I would only suggest to have more beers on tap, but they are part of Ellis Island so I understand why they do not carry other brands."}
{"text":"Village Pub servers great food and at a reasonable price. However, this location seems to have problems with the service. They are slow and non-attentive. The only time that they seemed to remember us was to drop off the check, in the process ignoring the fact that our drinks were empty and that we were still eating our meal, and not even asking if we wanted something else (like desert). The location was also smoky as this location doesn't have a separate dinning area. Even though this location is close to our home we will be driving a little farther next time we want to go to Village Pub."}
{"text":"Ok, so one of my pet peeves on Yelp is when people leave 4 or 5 star reviews for fast food/chain places that are undeserving. But hear me out on Village Pub. I've been to multiple locations and never had a bad experience. I usually go late night/early morning after work. I've never sat in the restaurant, only at the bar. But the menu is the same. The prices are SUPER reasonable. You can easily eat for under 10.   First of all the the whole menu is available 24 hours a day. Which is great, and a lot of things are homemade. Here are some of the things I've had.  Potato Skins - Way better than Fridays, 4 Giant potato halves topped with bacon, cheese, and onions. Really good.  Wings - Just OK. Nothing special.  Meatball Sliders - Seriously one of the best meatballs I've ever had. They are served on a mini pretzel roll. They are so good. and only 5.99. I would never expect a Pub to have decent italian food, but its soooo good.  Chicken Fried Steak - Also really good, the \"steak\" is actually pork. But its hand battered and fried. Topped with really good gravy. The breakfast potatoes are awesome.  It's not a fancy place, I wouldn't take a date there. But its quality food at good prices."}
{"text":"I really like this place and have for years.  I had a great steak and eggs breakfast special this morning.  The waitress was good and friendly.  And you know what else they did that few restaurants do?  They heated the plate.  Terrific."}
{"text":"I lived in Las Vegas for 35 years, and the orange roughy these places prepare was legendary then, so I ordered it.  It was awful!!!  The garlic was so strong I took only two bites, same as my dining partners.  When the redo arrived, it was drenched in lemon juice.  What a disappointment.  And I had the feeling that the waitress was also the cook.    I gave them a try at lunch the next day, and the hamburger was outstanding.  So I'm averaging between one star and five for a three."}
{"text":"I really like this place for their value and quality. They have a great rib special, and their burgers are bomb. A lot of older people frequent this place because Sun City is not far. The service is great, and I really like it here!"}
{"text":"I went here while getting my tires done at discount tires. Amazing. The patrons there were awesome, friendly, talkative. The bar tenders were so polite that I felt like a regular even though it was my first time. Quick service as well. I'll be going here for Food every time I get my tires done. Thank you to the staff for making sure my day was well met with good food, drink, and company. You guys and seriously awesome."}
{"text":"This place is always good the pot pie was excellent the prices are great it's cozy and private"}
{"text":"What can I say...this used to be my regular as it was cheaper for dinner for two here than cooking on your own.  It's still OK.  Full of Dell Web residents if you get there for an early dinner.  Love Mirna, the waitress that has been there for years!"}
{"text":"Great local pub to have a drink and watch the game.  There is also a separate dining area which serves your basic diner menu and a daily special.  I recommend the fish and chips.  But the bar is where to go: numerous flat screen tv's, nice selection of brew, and friendly bartenders.  The weird thing is you can't order food in the bar area.  Overall, a good place to unwind and grab some comfort food."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is great chef really knows how to throw down on the chicken wings especially (hot) and all the bartenders are very good people Randy being my favorite. This place always has good locals, good conversation and fast service Randy never lets your drink get low and has a really good personality so come check him out you won't be upset I promise!"}
{"text":"Bomb food. Great nfl games menu cheap and delicious. Happy hour great Friendly atmosphere. I really enjoy coming here to kick back and have a drink. I recommend giving this place a shot. Lori the waitress was awesome always is"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood type bar. They have several locations in town, but this review is for this particular location, as I haven't been to the others and don't know if they're similar in setup.   The establishment offers a separate bar area with smoking (21+) where you can order food/gamble. The bar felt a bit secluded and dim, it wasn't my favorite place and likely I wouldn't be a regular in the bar area. The other portion is smoke free with food, underage allowed - you can order alcoholic beverages in the restaurant area too.   The food is reasonably priced ($8-$15 per plate) and quality was average. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. We had the nachos and the Caesar salad. Others in the group said the chicken fried steak is good, but I can't verify firsthand.   The service at the bar was decent. The bartender quickly served us the drinks and the bill. He bantered with the other patrons, who seemed to be regulars and knew the bartender.  We joined a large group, in the group sitting area. We had one server who handled the entire group. He tended to our large group pretty well. Getting everyone's orders, drinks, etc. I didn't hear anyone complain of getting the wrong order, incorrect billing, etc. We all had separate checks, which he kept separated without incipient.  Kudos for handling our group so well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this village pub for breakfast 3 or 4 times a week for the past three years. Today I was told you no longer serve half and half. You just lost a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks at a good price. My bartender Lori took really great care of me. My country fried steak was delicious and huge portions! Had it as leftovers for lunch and it was still good. If you're looking for a chill place with good drinks and atmosphere, this is the best."}
{"text":"Village Pub Summerlin- I thought I was on Candid Camera with the array of lousy food and service. My family of four was seated at a small table that would have been comfortable for two, rather uncomfortable for a family of four. I did notice the couple behind us was seated at a four top. My son got  a squeezed lemon in his soda which he clealry didnt ask for. The waitress a heavy set red head was oblivious to the seating issues and later the food issues. I guess if she ever came came to check on us I would have told her that my sons burger was served without bacon ( which clealry he ordered) and was served with two bottom halves of the burger bun. I also would have told her that the busbot spilled water all over my slacks ,never apologized and never brought over anything to clean me the table or the booth. Upon leaving I asked for the manager another server( heavy set blonde woman) told me the manager was behind the bar when I went up to the guy she pointed to and asked him if he was the manager he said \" No Im the bartender\" when I asked if I could speak to the manger/supervisor he told me  there wasnt one, when I asked him who was in charge he told me\" the girls\". Hence if you leave your servers in charge of food quality and customer service chances are ther will be some issues. Perhaps becuase we had a coupon that guaranteed 18% gratuity our server didnt really see the need to do her job as she was already quaranteed her tip.  I sent an e mail to the location and told them  what a lousy experience I had,I guess they couldnt be bothered with e mailing me back. Needless to say we will not be asked and when asked I will most definently not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always come here for one thing. The baby back ribs. They are the same baby back ribs as the spot inside Ellis Island. The sides are different but the bbq sauce is the same and the ribs are just as moist and fall off the bone."}
{"text":"I started going to The Village Pub when I was a kid and my parents and I lived in Desert Shores back around 1996. The dinning area is small and most of the time there is a long wait. Last time we went they only had 1 server and it was the dinner rush time. The food is decent bar food. They have nightly specials and are decently priced. They have the 6oz filet, that my husband always gets, for around $9. The bar can get smokey and loud at times. We usually go to The Pub when we cant think of anywhere else to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to frequent the Village Pub in Desert Shores for years, but after a really bad experience, we never went back. Over the weekend he said he wanted to give this location a try, I was a bit hesitant but gave in.   When you walk in, you have the bar to the left that's closed off with doors, to the right  there's a separate dining area. We were allowed to sit where we wanted.  We ordered the following items for dinner:  - Stuffed potato skins ($6.49) -Pot pie ($8.99) -Steak and eggs ($8.99) - Chocolate brownie ($4.99)  The stuffed potato skins were really crispy, they were stuffed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and to my husbands dismay, chives. I have no problem with them but he picked them off. They were served with a side of ranch and sour cream. I had the steak and eggs for my entree and my husband had the chicken pot pie. His pot pie was amazing, it was really rich and creamy. My steak was really tender and juicy, what really stood out were the potatoes, they were well seasoned. I still had a little room for dessert so we went with the brownie, it was loaded with whipped cream, drizzled in chocolate sauce, and topped with ice cream. I need that brownie in my mouth for the rest of my life, it was so good.   Our server server for the night was Brenden, outstanding service from him and his fellow co-workers, they would all check up on us and ask if we needed anything, plus they were all very friendly . I'm a fan of this location now, great food and service, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I eat the Village Pub a few times a week and just LOVE the food, hands down best burger in town! My other favorites Include the wings, BLT, and their breakfast is awesome as well. You can't beat the price for the quality, great lunch specials and happy hour specials! The best part is the staff, they are all so wonderful, it's my favorite restaurant on the eastside!"}
{"text":"I love the food & service here. But the food is expensive. I would come more often if they offered some incentives for entrees. Yes they have specials here. I am not discounting the effort. As I said good food. I just wish the pricing was a better deal."}
{"text":"Still love the pub. Try the fish and chips, it's one of their signature items and they are delicious. They come with a side of house made tartar sauce which is yummy. I also enjoy the steak sandwich, Caesar salad, chicken wings, lemon chicken, and the salmon. Really everything here is good and you can't go wrong. The Caesar dressing here is amazing. It's house made with lots of Parmesan cheese and garlic. I get it almost every time - and I'm a ranch lover!   They get pretty busy so dont be surprised if there is a wait. They also usually only have 2 servers working at a time, so service can be a bit slow. The waitresses are always very friendly though, and when the service is good it makes the wait for food more tolerable.The only negative thing I have to say is the fact that there is nothing separating the bar from the dining room. The restaurant itself is non-smoking, but the smoke from the bar wafts into the dining area. I always smell like an ash tray when I leave there. Now that I'm a mother, these things matter and I'll likely keep my kid out of here for that reason."}
{"text":"We just walked out... There is a sign that says, \"please wait to be seated\", so that is what we did.  To only find out no worker wanted to greet us as we stood there at the post, then a woman waitress walked up to us grabbed her purse from under the stand and did not say anything and walked out.  Then on top of that we waited for another 5-10 minutes with the other waiters looking over but NOBODY ever greeted us.  So we ultimately walked out and still nobody said anything!  What horrible customer service, I would never try and support this place again.  We completely felt shamed and judged... absolutely a horrible environment as well!"}
{"text":"Village pub is one of my favorite places to go to  with the family especially for breakfast. My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito, hands down the best breakfast burrito in town. Only thing is that they stop serving it after 11 after that you'd have to order from a smaller all day breakfast menu. For lunch or dinner I'd probably go with their delicious baked penne pasta with a side salad or a burger. Adam has a way of making you feel at home especially if your a regular like us. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Great local spot for a meal with the family. Get the steak dinner, it's a affordable and delicious! Great because they separate the dining room from the bar area."}
{"text":"A neighborhood bar that is a chain all over Vegas. This is the first Village pub that I've been to, so I'm not sure how it compares to others. We ate in the bar area at the tables, and were served by a really nice waitress. We ordered the chicken sandwich and the Philly cheesesteak dip. The cheesesteak was a little in the chewy side, but the au jus was pretty good. The chicken was a pretty standard grilled chicken breast, but the bread was really good. For about $10/entree and cheap drinks, I cant complain! We also played some video poker at the bar. They serve local Ellis Island beer on tap here and it's very affordable too!"}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same people that own Ellis Island (http://www.yelp.com/biz/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA) but it is not a casino, just a restaurant. The prices are a bit higher here. I think it is $6.95 for the same steak dinner you get for $4.95 at Ellis Island. The food is the same though. I give it 4 stars because you can get the same thing for cheaper at Ellis Island. But if you want to avoid a crowd, which sometimes exists at Ellis Island, head to the pub."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Good steak and eggs. Normal stuff."}
{"text":"This place is PERFECT for burger and a beer on the way home.  Try the sirloin special.... It's delicious!"}
{"text":"The best steak, eggs and bloody Mary\"s in town"}
{"text":"Dark, windowless bar that smells of stale cigarettes but has pretty good eats. It's been awhile since I stopped by, but the employees were friendly and it did not take long to receive drinks and food. 24 hours, which is always a plus for being down the street - believe it or not, not everything is always open."}
{"text":"Walked in here waiting for a friend and the service from Raul and Mike has been top notch! Everything you expect in a local bar. Good food, good vibes, gaming and cheap drinks! I'll be back again for sure! Thanks to the awesome staff! Plus they carry Ellis island craft beers! Doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"This place can be subbed up in one word, disappointing. As soon as you walk in the door you feel like you went back in time. Clearly a remodel hasn't been in the budget for a few decades. After you get past the decor now it's time to deal with the waiter. This individual definitely let us know he had no desire to be at work and prompt service isn't on the menu. Apparently we were out of line to ask to have the football game on the tv. It was a Sunday evening, and we wanted food and football. Our waiter told us he was busy and would get to it. He did put the game on, as soon as we walked out the door. I'm guessing asking for drink refills was too much to ask. Since we NEVER were able to get a second drink. I have never had a waiter make me feel like I was an inconvenience until this night. I can oversee the outdated atmosphere but poor customer service is inexcusable. I will not be returning and I in courage you to explore other dining options."}
{"text":"OMFG, one of the best steak and eggs I have so far. The best part about their steak and eggs is that it's 24 hours! You don't have to wait until midnight."}
{"text":"I dont live too far from The Village Pub.  It's nestled in between a 24-hour taco shop and a storage facility.  It promises video poker jackpots and a friendly atmosphere.  Needless to say it's not overly inviting from the outside - but proximity as well as the opinions of fellow Yelpers finally convinced me to try out this nearby restaurant.  As with most local bars, you can choose to go into a restaurant portion or the bar portion of the building.  The restaurant is smoke free, and although this location is relatively new, the restaurant interior suggests otherwise.  Everything is clean and in good condition - it just looks much older.  We went for dinner on Saturday night and there were only a few other patrons seated inside.  There was no hostess stand or any sign directing us to seat ourselves.  The waitress walked by where we were standing, even said hello, but never told us to seat ourselves.  Not a big deal, just a weird interaction.  Having read the reviews on Yelp I knew what kind of menu to expect.  I knew I wanted a burger and I knew DC was going to get the fish and chips.  We also decided on a pint of EI beer and the sweet potato tots.  The waitress was very pleased with our tots selection and really started raving about them.  When they came out, they were served with plastic tub of syrup - our waitress said the syrup took the tots to a whole different level.  She was right.  Seriously.  sweet potato tots may hold the key to world peace.  They were hot and sweet and savory all at the same time.  They had the right amount of crunch and were not greasy at all.  These would be great for breakfast, great for kids as a side dish, and definitely great at 3am after having a couple beers at the bar next door.    DC loved his fish and chips.  Three giant pieces of cod that were seriously fresh.  DC marveled at how good it was, and he was disappointed that he was served more food than he could comfortably fit into his belly.  I ordered the Southwest burger, which was topped with sauteed onions and jalapenos, cheese, and guacamole (also chipotle mayo, but I opted out).  This burger was massive, hot, and delicious.  Mine was cooked a little more well done than I asked for, but I'm not overly picky about that.  The burger had serious spice from the jalapenos, but it was fantastic.  Overall, the food was far better than the exterior of the building suggests.  The price was ridiculously low for what we got.  Our waitress was very friendly, even though a little awkward at times.    I can't speak to the rest of the Village Pub locations and the quality of their food, but if you're ever down in this part of the Valley, stop in and get some exceptional food at a fantastic price."}
{"text":"My family was in town from Chicago and we all celebrate St. Patrick's Day so we all wanted to eat corned beef and cabbage.  I never been here but this place is 5 minutes from my house so I figured let's try it out.  First and foremost it was crowded,  the 2 employees working were busting their ass. I was getting annoyed because no one acknowledged us for a good 15 minutes,  but I don't blame the employees,  I blame management that was no where in sight.  Finally we sat down,  ordered our food about 15 minutes later our food came out.  It was excellent!!! We will definitely be back.  I gave 4 stars because they were wayy understaffed for a popular holiday. But our waiter Matt did a great job!!!"}
{"text":"The nautical paintings that adorn the walls of this very slightly smokey establishment are what really sell the experience when you eat here.   The service is very good and while the food ranges from almost very good to just barely good, the price makes dining here a very very good value. Especially for breakfast or brunch.   You'll likely enjoy a good meal here, if you're okay with the slight tinge of smokey air."}
{"text":"This place is really cool.  We were looking for a new neighborhood spot after Black Mountain Grill's service went off the deep end and Carmine's closed.  This is the place!  Nick, the bartender, was very cool and took care of us.  The food was quite tasty.  Kind of like diner food, but way better than normal bar food.  We'll be back.  A lot.  :)"}
{"text":"Ok, so my cell service doesn't work at the table and they don't offer wifi. The coleslaw was soggy and they offered my girlfriend a plate for her to have a portion of my ribs and it was dirty. I watched the chef come from the back and hug a woman with gloves on and I'm pretty certain he's back there cooking with the same glove he touched this woman's jacket with. They also brought my lady some fries that are noticeably undercooked."}
{"text":"Last time we were here was a year ago for a bottle of the Ellis Island Eggnog.  They were out, but we stayed for drinks and a meal.  Made it back a little sooner this year and the eggnog was still in stock.  The evening also served as a sharp reminder as to why this is a once a year, at most, dining experience.  The bar was relatively empty and service was prompt and courteous.  Appetizer nachos were good.  It was maybe 10 minutes after we ordered before we were informed that my wife's onion soup was in fact unavailable.  Not a huge deal.  When entrees arrived my Greek Penne Pasta with \"vegetables\" included some huge chunks of mushroom (neither vegetables nor mentioned on the menu), and the consistency was that of a pasta salad.  Twice as much chicken and under-cooked carrots as pasta.  I pointed out my dissatisfaction and the bartender informed me that that was a \"penne pasta.\"  There literally could not have been more than fifteen pieces of penne on the dish - and one would expect pasta to be the cheapest part of the entree!  It was not a pasta dish.  And I seriously doubt my concerns made it past the defensive bartender.  My wife's salad was perfectly mediocre.  Kinda feels like a place that survives on the gaming and doesn't care about the quality of the food.  Our server was nice enough to take the missing onion soup and dissatisfactory 'pasta' off the bill.  But next year it will just be a pit stop for the eggnog."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and their food is always amazing! The service is pretty good, not bad but nothing that stands out. We get the soup every time we go no matter what it is and it's always delicious. The steak and eggs is our favorite meal, but we get the mashed potatoes instead of the breakfast potatoes. Also, DEFINITELY try to fried chicken with French fries. So good!"}
{"text":"Best bloody Mary's ever!!!!  Everytime I come to Vegas, this is the first place I come. Sooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"You'd never know you were in a video poker bar, which the Village Pub essentially is. I'd describe the Village Pub as an upscale dive. I'm actually quite surprised by the menu of this little joint and their prices are pretty cheap.   I have only ever ordered breakfast here because they have an extensive menu ranging from omelets, skillets (my fave!), paninis, wraps, and traditional breakfasts: steak/ham and eggs, pancakes, chicken fried steak, corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy, French toast, eggs benedict - you name it, they got it!  Last week's visit included a breakfast burrito, which was HUGE! This bb was overloaded with eggs, bacon AND sausage, cheddar cheese (ahhhhh), big chunks of seasoned potatoes, onions, salsa and sour cream and was absolutely delicious! My friend ordered the ham and eggs and the ham covered the entire plate. It seriously was enough for 3 or 4 people.   I've even ordered oatmeal which comes loaded up with cranberries, brown sugar, pecans and milk.  Now the lunch and dinner menu offers everything from bar food (quesadillas, nachos, chili fries, potato skins, etc.) to more sophisticated plates that you wouldn't expect to find in a small bar including pot pie, orange roughy, fish and chips, salads, chicken cordon bleu, paninis, different salmon options, steak and shrimp, and ribeye steak platters. A friend of mine eats here regularly and he swears by their food.   Their specialty is burgers (and they'll substitute a turkey burger for you too!): Smokehouse, Yorky, Frisco, Southwest, Hawaiian, Texas and many more!   Oh and they do wraps too! Not a bad little place and your wallet won't even notice it.  And the best part - their kitchen is open 24/7! Hurray!!!! Great food for next to nothing!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their breakfast. Their menus won't show it, but they offer \"Steak & Eggs\" which consists of two eggs, steak, choice of toast, and potatoes, all for $6.99. Your wallet and stomach will be happy, trust.  Pros: - Steak & Eggs*. Great value for your money. - Video poker machines at the bar.  Cons: - Ambiance can be a bit depressing in the breakfast hours. I don't know about their lunch and dinner hours though. - A few miles away from the Las Vegas strip.  *Steak & Eggs is not to be confused with \"Ham Steak & Eggs\""}
{"text":"Had their fish and chips. They were perfect. Coleslaw was okay not bad and not excptional. The new batch of the red beer was awesome!   All four of us enjoyed our meal and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"There are two signs that say they are open 24 hours and I just tried going at 11pm and they were closed! False advertisement. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped eating at village pub two years ago because of poor food and service. I thought I would try it again today.  Eggs Benedict with brown graveyard sausage were horrible. I couldn't eat them. Coffee was room temp. When I asked for a warm up, 15 minutes later I got more room temp coffee. I will never be back again. They don't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it! This is what makes Las Vegas special! $9 steak special all day! Sometimes the steak isn't that great but come on what do you want from these people!?! Love the village pub and Ellis island!"}
{"text":"My parents took me here last weekend.   They started going to the Village Pub several months ago and have been telling me how great the food is and how reasonable the prices were, so I was looking forward to it.  I got the California Panini which had chicken, avocado, and Monterey jack. I got cottage cheese on the side. My food was okay but nothing to get excited about.  My mom had the turkey special, and my dad ordered the fried chicken special. They both had a cup of chicken noodle soup. They both really liked the soup but neither thought their entrees were as good as usual.  The downfall of the evening was the service. It was probably 15 minutes after we were seated before the waitress came over to take our order. It took even longer to get the food. The waitress pointed to people at another table who had been seated for a long time without being helped and told them, \"I'll be awhile.\" This was by far the worst service I have received in a long time.  The food was okay and the prices were reasonable, but unless my parents are treating I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this Village Pub location - The staff is amazing. I believe Sasha, the bartender is about the best I've ever had, and I'm almost 70. Also, there's a Bus Boy there named Norman that never stops working - He got me a little dizzy moving around with his speed.   For the most part my wife and I sit at the bar - Boy can she eat. She loves this place. I order the Top Sirloin, medium rare, and guess what - I get it medium rare. Once in awhile we sit in the dinning room - We've never had a single complaint with the service or our orders - Kevin and Oliver are amazing servers."}
{"text":"Since we travel to the Las Vegas area several times a year, we always look for great little eating places that offer good food at reasonable prices. A few years ago we discovered The Village Pub on Eastern, near Wigwam. The food there was always excellent. As of late we've been staying in the Summerlin area and were delighted to find another Village Pub on Regatta - a much shorter drive.  This one is a bit smaller than the other location but had very similar decor - good if you like tall masted sailing ships like the brigantines and schooners. Unlike it's counterpart, the Pub on Regatta has no glass windows and doors separating the smokers at the bar from the dining area in the restaurant. You have to walk a hazy, stinking gauntlet of smoke and stale cigarette butts to get into the restaurant. There's not much in the way of modern air filtration so make sure you get a table as far back in the dining room as possible to lessen the impact of that acrid stench.   There were six of us. No other customers were waiting. A server quickly greeted us and told us we would be seated shortly. Then he walked into the back, grabbed a cleaning cloth, and proceeded to wipe down a small table, straighten the condiments, walk to the back again, returning with and carefully placing four sets of silverware on the small table while leaving the six of us standing there watching for several minutes. When he finally seemed satisfied with his handiwork, he finally turned his attention back to us and walked us to our large table at the back of the room. Apparently, cleaning and resetting a table nobody is waiting for was more important than seating customers who were left standing in the doorway for six or seven minutes. Not a long time to be ignored.... Just irritating.  Once seated, menus quickly arrived, beverage selections made, and orders placed. Four had the 10 ounce rib-eye special, one had the bar-b-qued ribs, and I had an order of \"best fish and chips\" in Las Vegas.   The drinks finally arrived amid apologies and thanks for our patience. No big deal. The food arrived within reasonable time frame. The first steak, ordered medium, came very well done and was promptly sent back to the kitchen. To be fair, the other three steaks were cooked perfectly to order. The side dishes, salads, and soups were also good. Not great, but good enough. And after the others were about half finished with their meals, the reordered steak came to the table and was also cooked to perfection.  As for \"The best fish and chips in Las Vegas\".... Not at this location. I've had this dish several times at the other location and they really were THAT good. At the Regatta location the first order arrived dark brown on one side, almost black on the other. I ate part of one of the three pieces, but the fish was dry, over cooked, and had a burnt aftertaste. I immediately sent them back. Shortly thereafter, a second order arrived. Not much lighter than the first, but juicier. The batter coating was oily and unpleasant so I removed it, and ate only the fish inside, which was at least edible. I decided not to send them back again because the other guests were almost finished eating. In all honesty, I could have gotten better fish and chips at some corner fast food joint. In my opinion the cooking oil was old and burnt, and the fish was left in way to long. These were the worst I've ever tasted and this restaurant has done a definite disservice to the Village Pub reputation. I will never eat at this location agaIn.... Better to drive the extra miles to the Eastern location. It rated two stars for the other orders that turned out well...."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is good and specials are decent. Price is average. Worst part about this place is the service. No one greets you but they all look at you as they walk by like, \"sheesh, more customers\"  Its on parr with the likes of Tbird lounge and Blue Diamond Saloon. Mediocre"}
{"text":"I am so happy that we discovered this place!!!!! My son and I were craving fish and chips last night and couldn't really think of where to go,  yelped it but couldn't really get a good feel from any reviews specifically on fish n chips,  I remembered my gf had told me about village pub in desert shores had great fish n chips and her and her hubby eat there all the time.  So we got there right before 6 on Friday night and was already busy,  we were seared right away and our waitress and bus boy were super sweet and attentive!!!!  We both got the fish and chips and it was famous light and flaky, , 3huge pieces,  great crust,  fries were perfect and they have weekly specials and the prices were so cheap,  I can't wait to go back there and try other things! By the time we left there a little after 7 the line was Almost out the door,  the best sign of a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Close to home (for me, at least) and CHEAP!  If you're a food snob, you will probably leave unsatisfied, but for the price, you can't beat it.    I went on a weeknight with a girlfriend and the place was empty aside from a few people at the bar.  I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy (my favorite breakfast food) because I would like to know where I could satisfy the craving close to home and it was HELLA cheap.    Although it was cheap, I just couldn't stomach it.  It had a weird flavor and weird texture.  I really enjoy a thick and creamy gravy with a TON of sausage (there was barely any sausage in the gravy, but that's a norm for most restaurants- I'm not giving 3 stars for that) and this gravy certainly is thick and creamy, so I was excited when it arrived at the table.  I cannot describe the flavor, it just wasn't like any sausage gravy I've ever eaten (restaurant or at home) and it was a little gritty- almost like there was too much flour or something?  I also ordered the Root Beer (whatever is on the menu- I have no idea about it's name), which was pretty delicious!  Service is pretty friendly and quick (except the waitress seemed a little annoyed that we took so long to decide what we wanted to order...).  My only real problem with this place is the smoke.  When you walk in, you practically walk into an ashtray.  The stench of stale cigarettes is strong, even when there aren't any smokers.  Is this a ventilation issue or just life in Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"My 100th review on Yelp and what do you know, bang, 5 stars.  Love this little local joint. Breakfast steak and eggs, $6.99  More importantly, the steak was great. Would definitely go back. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but the service needs improvement. Great prices and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is so ,so orderd a small salad and soup and stake and shrimp scampi I asked for thousand island for the salad oh boy they put way too much thousand island the soup...  not feeling it... just had the whole meal very mediocre food lacks flavor the servers are just ok"}
{"text":"The food is good, prices are good and service is great. I just get super annoyed that they won't take phone orders. I don't always have time to sit and wait for the food to cook and many times I don't want to go inside to eat. So, we just pick up food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, sat at the bar for 25 minutes and not getting served or greeted. The will only serve the regulars which there where only five other people there. Pissed off and left."}
{"text":"This is our Friday night dinner spot.  Great food and great service.  We seem to always eat late with the kids when we go and there is never a wait.  We have not been let down once.  The entire menu is great.  Dining room is cutoff from the bar so you wont choke on smoke and therefore makes it fine for kids."}
{"text":"Some of the best \"bar food\" around, the fish and chips, hot breaded wings and burgers are just awsome. Robyn is one of the best bartenders I have encountered, she is very attentive to all patrons.  Great job John , Robert , and Robyn"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood bar. I like to come here for a drink and relax. The steak special is my favorite. It's mostly a neighborhood bar where most, if not all, patrons are your next door neighbor.  The level of service changes depending on the mood of the staff and how busy they are. I had days with the worst service and days with great service.  Over all its a cool cozy spot."}
{"text":"Worst Village Pub in town. My husband has ordered food to go from there a few times, order is rarely correct. He has called to complain but they don't care. He has gambled while waiting & is still charged for a drink?!? Once they said the credit card machine was down & he had to use ATM to get cash. I'm positive they pocketed the $. We will drive out of our way to either go to another Village Pub or just another local bar."}
{"text":"Restaurant- service was good and food was decently priced. My friend and I both got the French dip philly style and the meat was dry and bread was too thick and hard. Onion rings (for an upcharge) were amazing but they gave me 5. Hardly enough. Probably won't got back or if I do I'll definitely order something else."}
{"text":"My neighbor used to rent the house next to mine. He was a chef at this location. So I stopped by one day. Wow, this is one of the greatest places in the county.  The food is excellent, drinks are affordable and service is world class. I've never been disappointed. I come from the east coast, where people talk and communicate openly. I find the customers in this bar willing to talk and just have  a good time.  I would recommend this place for anyone needing to relax after work, or even for a couple on a first date. The service as I said is great, and the prices will not bankrupt a couple just exploring on that first date.  And when you leave, the staff will say Thank you and Good Night.  It is the small things in life that really make a difference. It also is what sustains a strong customer base."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!  A gem!  Selection, service & quality were worth the drive to find it"}
{"text":"Being so close to where we do 'business', the Pub is often our choice...and the price is decent---Oh, Oh, new menus (again!) probably higher prices too?   Sometimes the service is terrific (Adam, Carlo, Alicia) sometimes the service is NOT so good (nearly every Sunday morning).   Management always trying to save a dime.   Occasionally in the evening we will experience a truly well-cooked, well-presented meal.  We can tell when there is a visiting/substitute cook.  So sometimes our meal/service is 5 Star, but not often.  Usually mediocre, but at least it is what we ordered & looks like it too.  However:  9/10/2016:  Stopped in for a quick meal and a HARD ROOTBEER...being phased out we hear, too bad....On sale now $1.50 a glass!  Ordered the Chicken Fingers that I've ordered a hundred times (been going to the Pub for almost 10 years) expecting what I've ordered for years.  Instead some small, strange shaped pieces of overly deep-fried crunchy chunks.  Horrid!   Didn't want to cause a fuss, so nearly broke a tooth trying to eat.   Waste of $$.  Tried to peel off the thick granite coating, but impossible since there was so little chicken fused to the outer rock formation.  Adam was his usual accommodating self and tried to explain, even getting more of the 'chicken fingers' since the hard chunks were so small...simply more of the same brick-hard batter posing as chicken fingers.  The kitchen should be ashamed.  Ellis Island, you must give something better than this,  there are plenty of restaurants in L. Vegas.  Get a decent cook who doesn't over-cook everything to rock hard and hire a few more servers.  Quit messing with things that have been on the menu for years---wouldn't it be fair to let customers know when something this dramatic happens to a menu item?  If it's not making a high enough profit for you (Oh, those chicken fingers used to be so good), then take them off the menu.  So disappointed, I may stop going to the Pub altogether."}
{"text":"We tried them last night and the steak was so tender and everything was very good. Maybe there are different cooks on and they improved. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"No need to go to Ellis island this place has all the same food and might be actually better! No need to suffer in lines food is always fresh and the severs are so nice I recommend coming here instead of Ellis island"}
{"text":"This is a good little neighborhood bar and pub that's excellent for groups and just general hanging out.  The bar is HUGE and there's always a myriad of people crowded around it.  The fish and chips are god, as are the steak dinners.  Everything is well priced and the staff is quick and attentive.  It's not the chicest place in the world, but I won't complain if I'm asked to hang out there."}
{"text":"Have to give props where props are due: this is a solid option for better-than-average comfort/pub food. Close to my favorite P & C \"lake\" open 24/7 with great general prices, outstanding Happy Hour/Reverse HH deals, and breakfast all day. I come here quite a bit.   Favorite dishes: Apple pecan salad with grilled chicken when I'm behaving; Fish & Chips, fingers or Buffalo Chicken Wrap on naughty days. PIC & Dad love the Chicken Pot Pie and Pot Roast. Soups are hit and miss.   The bartenders are all friendly, so are the waitresses. After 9PM you have to eat at the bar, they bring cute little trays to bridge the gap between Video Poker and bar rail. Don't be a moron like me and leave your phone under it, D'oh! (Ian handled that like a champ)   I'm clearly a fan, and wish there was a place like this in AZ :(  * it is VERY smoky  * after midnight, ring bell for entry *  HH specials & hours included in pics."}
{"text":"I love this place. A small, hometown bar, very low key and great service. Nothing like sitting at the bar and getting VIP treatment. Whomever they are hiring their people, keep it up. People are always nice, friendly and easy going. The fact that it's a few minutes from my house is also a plus but even without that, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can call this place unfriendly. I've lived here 3 weeks. Three Weeks! I came here because it's close to my new home and I like a casual, inexpensive place to just relax. Because I vape, I sit at the bar. All the bartenders already know me, and what I drink. They've even apologized in advance for not having my preferred drink on hand one night. They helped me log on the their game systems when I have a problem. They cheer when I win, sympathize when I lose. A big shout out, and thanks.   The food is typical pub food. The fish and chips are amazing. Yes, there have been some screwup and inconsistencies, hence the 4 stars,  but overall the food has been good. I haven't been in the dining room so perhaps the staff there needs a little coaching, but I've never had bad food or bad service myself."}
{"text":"Best Build Your Own Burger in town!!! Along with the fish and chips, chicken sandwich, and chicken wings!!! Haven't ate anything bad here!!! :) Thank you, April, as always for the great service:) You are AWESOME!!! We are regulars now!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Low prices. Did I mention good food? It is always a pleasant surprise when I done at Village Pub. Fish & Chips are fantastic! Today I had the special:  2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage patties and 2 buttermilk pancakes for $6.99. Excellent!  I will be back."}
{"text":"I was going to VP on eastern and wigwam. They have had great food and customer service, up until last night. They have a new bartenderhis name is Erik who has no regard for customers nor the fact that he doesnt care if his employer is losing business from my friends and I."}
{"text":"Village Pub is great! Very friendly staff, tasty bar food and great variety for a good price! This location also has a lot of TVs so you can watch multiple games at once. We wanted to watch a hockey game and the bartender was very nice and searched every channel to find it.  Thumbs up to village pub!"}
{"text":"The VP Classic Burger at lunch is a great deal and delicious. At the lunch the place is quiet and perfect for lunch appointments or a relaxing meal away from work. On tap Root Beer is also delicious."}
{"text":"We love our Village Pub! Rene, Penny, Julie, Noah, Chris all the bar tenders are absolutely amazing. You'll have a great time and sometimes free entertainment too. We do not eat much in the dinning room but when we do we have had either Brandon, Marlon or Chris. All severs are great. Very attentive. Anytime we have had problems (small issues) they have been fixed with a smile. Such a chill place to hang out have amazing food great happy hour specials and your not pressured to gamble. Must try the chicken fried chicken, California chicken panini with sweet tots, Village Pub chicken, Cobb salad, baked penne pasta, pot pie, broccoli cheddar soup with Prime rib on Saturdays, and the chicken wings and tenders are huge!! They also have a fantastic breakfast menu. Really can't go wrong with any of the food items. Love love love this place and everyone that works here!!!"}
{"text":"I work in the area so I come here for lunch sometimes.  The waitstaff is hit or miss - some good, some not.  The same could be said for the meals.    Its very dark and the noise from other tables carries all over the restaurant.  All in all its not a bad place but don't order the lunch special pasta - the sauce tastes like weeds, and I'm not too picky about pasta.  I always thought you couldn't go wrong with pasta but they have proven me wrong."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome wings!!  My new go to spot when I'm craving wings near home. I just wish they did to go orders over the phone so I could pick them up and they would be ready on my way home from work instead of having to wait!"}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the outside but once we walked in, it was pretty cool! Red leather booths and ample seating. We each had something different to eat-a burger with feta and bacon, the fish and chips, and a French dip. None of us had complaints. Everything was season well, large portions, and it as served hot. The staff was very attentive and friendly. It was a pretty cool and if I ever get back to Vegas (I don't plan on it, tbh), and I'm close, I might just stop in again!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is definitely more of a spot for locals -- and is well off the strip.  No problem if you have a car...  The VP&P is tucked into a strip mall and not much to look at on the outside, or really on the inside.  However, the restaurant is quiet and reserved--with just plain great food.  From steaks to sandwiches, we have never had a bad meal here.  Combine great food with great off-the-strip prices, and you have a real winner here.    Highly recommended!  We always make a stop here when we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've always been satisfied with Village Pub. They've always been my go to place for a good burger. Sexy cougar bartenders, smoke friendly and just a good neighborhood bar. I don't like how you can't call in your order for pick up but it's probably due to missed pickup orders from other previous drunk people. Nonetheless I'd suggest them. Try the yorkie burger w/Swiss."}
{"text":"Nice local place, so close to where I live! I've tried the Barbecue Ribs and the Fish & Chips and they're both good. I actually plan to have the ribs again soon...haha. It's a local place, with a local vibe. The servers have always been friendly and professional. I good place to have a quiet meal. This is a review for the restaurant portion of the pub. I haven't spent any time at the bar, yet."}
{"text":"I have only been to this Village Pub location but it has set the standard I expect from all of them. The beer is brewed locally and hits the spot every time and I was particularly pleased with the food. For bar food it is pretty damn good. Kudos to Danny the bartender."}
{"text":"Ribs. Ribs ribs ribs ribs. Ribs on ribs on ribs. Guess what u go here u order the ribs u win. I like the ribs here because they r the best. They come from the mother ship restaurant Ellis island which has horrible customer service but we're talking about the village pub on Pecos and east flamingo where Kelly serves with a smile."}
{"text":"John bartender phenomenal service and attention to detail.  Truly cared about customer service. Very detailed oriented."}
{"text":"I've visited this bar several times over the last two years and have had the same experience:  You are not allowed to enjoy conversations with your friends above a whisper level.  Every. Single. Time. I've been in there with various friends we've been told to quite down or we'd be asked to leave.   We're not in there hooting and hollering or raising our voices, we're conversing in normal tones.    Mind you, me and my two friends were half of the people in the bar. Also I'd like to point out that we were not gambling so we were paying FULL PRICE for our drinks.  Also worth noting: don't use your speaker phone at any level or you will be warned. Don't use any sort of offense I've language or you will be warned. This includes talking about medical terms properly being used.    My friends and I like other locations in town and this one is central to all of us. So, we have decided we will go spend our money in the bar at the casino behind this place and not worry about offending anyone when we pepper our conversations with words like \"crap\" instead of sh*t (true story- crap was offense), or sharing a story of how HPV didn't exist when we were kids."}
{"text":"Walking into this place felt like I time traveled back to the 80's! The pub decor is very old fashioned. I thought it was pretty cool and really felt like I was in a different year. We were seated quickly but the server took over 10 minutes to come greet us . And we had to wave them down when we were ready to order. I ordered a breakfast panini but when I received my plate it was on wheat toast. I asked the person who brought it out if they had ran out of the regular bread they make it on and he informed me that no the order said I wanted it on wheat bread. That was incorrect and my food kept falling out of the toast since it wasn't big enough to hold everything. I would also recommend making sure the booths are cleaned more. There was hair and gunk all over the booth seats we were sitting on. We might give it another try and see if it's better next time but based on this experience I can only give 2 stars."}
{"text":"My first time here was for an event called Paint & Kimvas hosted by Kim. A few friends and I found her on groupon. She hosts a painting class in different locations in the valley. The particular painting we chose was conveniently taken place at Village Pub.   Me & Nieves D. arrived early so we seated ourselves at the bar and ordered a round of moscato, our favorite. She decided to order a small appetizer, nachos. Little did we know.. \"Small\" isn't part of their vocabulary at Village pub. It was a mountain of nachos!   Our other friend finally came. And the painting class was about to start so we just took our Nacho Mountain to the dining area. Our server, Brenden, came and got our 2nd round of drink orders. He was very pleasant and explained that the bartender can make whatever kind of drink we want. My two friends decided on a Tokyo Tea & I got a Mai Tai. Now these cocktails came out in a large water cup! And not no little midget glass like that usually do in bars. Those drinks were deliciousness!   Upon drinking another Mai Tai, I got a little hungry. I ordered their soup of the day which was Broccoli Cheddar Soup! Oh boy, that was super creamy & super good. I loved it and wished I ordered a bowl instead of a cup!    I'm really impressed with Village Pub. I didn't rate it 5 stars because we really didn't come here for Village Pub, we came here for the Paint & Kimvas event. I didn't have time to study the menu, atmosphere, nor did I spend enough time talking to the bartenders and servers. But I think I will be returning to try those infamous Pot Pies!"}
{"text":"Many drunk nights with my best best friend here at like midnight lol when its dead and they are vacuuming. The bartender was always awesome the food good to."}
{"text":"I have been to the Village Pub many times, and the food was great. This review is for this specific occasion. I am posting this one out of the many times, because I am new to yelp. Please note that I will leave comments everytime I eat there. Read both negatives you might laugh at this experience.   The service as always was warming and very helpful. So I can't give one star.  What takes my rating down to two stars is the food quality. I got a sirloin steak, and as usual I got it rare. Before I review the steak I would like to say the best part of the whole meal was the bread;  to me this is very bad because bread isn't an entrée. The steak came out eattible but not specifically enjoyable. It was burnt on the top not charred, burnt which took the quality of the whole steak down. It also seemed to be medium rare not rare as I requested. I guess the potato was alright, and the veggies seemed to be more for a visual.  Another negative, was the plate my friend had. She asked for the Cajun pasta, but I think she got butter pasta. Needless to say she did not eat her meal, only the bread. Later that night she also felt alittle sick.  To reiterate I've been to the Village Pub countless times and this is my only comment because I am new to yelp. Look out for more comments on Village Pubs and any other places."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited the Village Pub the other day, and were met with service that was lacking. We ordered the fish and chips and the steak, and weren't disappointed. It was pretty quiet, and we were probably the youngest people in the place.   It was good for bar food, but not really my style."}
{"text":"Absolutely love village pub. Great bartenders, great food, good crowd. Happy hour specials on appetizers.....best bargain I've come across yet. This is my spot when I'm in town visiting my family.  The staff at this establishment are A+"}
{"text":"The Village Pub is a fun little Pub on Eastern Ave.  This Las Vegas based chain of Pubs offers great breakfast specials and good drinks 24 hours.  The Pub itself has the feel of a TImber's lodge or Sierra Gold more than your neighborhood Pt's.  Overall, a nice place to stop in and grab a drink."}
{"text":"The staff and service here are amazing! I ordered the fish tacos and they were super simple but delicious. The environment is calm and quiet. Even though they allow smoking you can't really smell it. The lighting is a bit dark me but your eyes a just so its not really that bad. All I can say is the staff really is amazing here?"}
{"text":"Went in during the work day for lunch. Burgers and ribs. Food was good and staff was polite but very slow. Seemed understaffed. I would not recommend this place for lunch during the work day unless you can afford to take a 90 Minute lunch break. I can't."}
{"text":"I had been here before once and had good service and goodd food.  I went on 9/8 by myself and had the CFS dinner.  The lady didn't introduce herself, didn't thank me when I left.  I did leave a tip also.  I think I will just stick to Ellis Island when they are not busy.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, the staff was cold."}
{"text":"This was an experience.  I booked a room in the Hampton Inn about a block away from this place.  I didn't have a car so the frontdesk guy recommended this place as the only walking distance place at that time of the night (about 9:00 PM).  So I made the walk and the first thing I noticed was that the whole shopping center was dark and all the businesses seemed to be closed, not many cars in the parking lot.  There was a big sign that says this place is opened 24hrs so I continued walking although with some trepidation.  Hunger won and I continued my walk.  The place has no windows, so I was expecting a strip joint or something like that, once again hunger won and I entered.  The dining room was closed but the bar offered a full menu so I went in through the glass doors to my right.  First thing that hit me was a strong cigarette smell that almost made me turn around, oh but the hunger.  No one was actively smoking, as a matter of facts I was their only customer at the time.  So I sat down and ordered their $12.99 full rack of ribs with stake fries.  And they were good!! very good! The stake fries were freshly cooked.  A decent full rack of BBQ ribs with stake fries and a soft drink for $16.00 (not including tip of course), I might even come back and try their fish & chips next."}
{"text":"The staff, the food, the gaming... It's my favorite spot... A nice reminder that there is a home away from home and it's just around the corner.. My favorite bartender is Jamie! The Thursday night girl.. She keeps it clean and fun and always has a recommendation that suits the chefs eye! This place will always hold a special place in my heart that makes my mundane 9-5 just a bit more tolerable.. Thanks for everything Village pub. You're the apple of my eye!!!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere...limited selection at the bar as far as drinks go.....fish n chips is really good...buffalo chicken wrap is quite tasty as well. I will have no problem going back to try other things from the menu :-)  24/7 steak special is my go to dish here lately.... hits the spot! very nice."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is in an innocuous strip center near the airport. The service was amazing by some very personable servers. I just had the best chicken pot pie of my life amazing! Best value in Las Vegas. The whole meal including the tip came out to $15. Loved it!"}
{"text":"No wait cheep great food what more can I say we love the staff there great"}
{"text":"Haven't been there in several years but decided to stop in for breakfast. Very Good and Great meal at A Great price. And didn't get his name but the server was excellent. Very friendly."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch. When I went the place was a ghost town. I almost decided to not go in, but I'd heard people say the food was good.   They have a small lunch special menu from 11-2 that has 4-5 items to choose off of. Most are moderately priced at $5.95.   I selected the taco salad. It was good however there was nothing special about it. It was a nice portion and tasty.   The service was very nice and prompt. I have nothing negative to say about the restaurant, just nothing stood out to make me want to return. I wouldn't refuse a return visit, however."}
{"text":"I saw someone's review that described this as an upscale dive - I think that's fitting.  I've never ordered anything here besides French Dip or a burger and I can say both are hearty and good.  This is a great go to place if I'm craving some steak fries and some good old American burger.  It's also cheap as hell for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Love the fish and chips!! They have beer battered code and steak fries that are some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Kevin (the swing shift bartender) is always spot on. I haven't had a bad meal here yet, nor do I anticipate one. They have great specials and a mellow atmosphere. Make sure to check the chalk board just inside the front door for the daily food specials."}
{"text":"I just want to give a shout to Lori she is so beautiful I delt with her and oh man is she is great very hardworker with always a smile on her face .She was running around like a busy bee ..Customer had alot demand and request and she handle each one of them with grace and willing to help..I truly in  love with her ..Her work ethics and her beauty inside and out.... she is amazing person truly and a very hard and I can't forget about april she always always busy with her cute self ...She make sure the food is accurate she takes care of all my needs..When u are hungry sometimes we can end up cranky but not here stop by..This place will amaze you"}
{"text":"No red bull and vodka.... We left upon finding this out... Bartender was nice though. I May go back just to see what their drink menu looks like."}
{"text":"I love this spot. It's our family breakfast every Sunday morning. The good is always great - love the sweet potato tots. And the service is awesome. My kids think its great they know our drink order when we walk in the door.x"}
{"text":"I love this place. I live within walking distance and this is always my go to on football Sunday, for drunchies, and just all the time. Service is friendly, lots of sports tvs and food is bomb. Love the wings, fish and chips, potato skins, Caesar salad, the list goes on. And it's dirt cheap too."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out gamble have wonderful food and socialize. The bartenders are always great and generous with the drinks. They weekly daily specials are always a great deal. They are so large you can easily split them with a second person."}
{"text":"really good breakfast! I got a simple bacon & eggs, came with toast and potatoes as sides. Big helpings, good price, very filling! Definitely will be going back.  Service was kind & attentive as well"}
{"text":"Rex can NO LONGER bear this burden in silence. Rex will admit when things are not right. Rex WILL call you out on your poor performance...and Village Pub it is your time.  Once upon a time there was a manager at the Villiage Pub...a tall bald bastard. Think if Yul Brenner and Kojak had a baby...the baby was unwanted...they attempted a back alley abortion...and it didn't take.  He was a good man and a better manager. He is no longer there and the place sucks! What does Rex hate more than anything else...okay...besides herpes of the anus...RIGHT... inconsistency. The damn place can't make two hamburgers at once without screwing them up. The food is not as good, period. Even if done as ordered... it isn't as good. The signature pot pie used to be the best in the city. Now, the sauce is so buttery it breaks when it cooks. The burgers are NEVER the right temperature.    Rex can't understand. Was it all baldy? Did they change cooks? When did urinating on your food and screaming \"WHERE IS BALDY...WHERE IS MY BALDY\" become a crime?  To add insult to injury...they have a card, a \"rewards\" card... it used to be 100 bucks spent to get 10 bucks back. Fair. Now it is 200 to get 10 bucks. Not so much. Rex has to eat there 12 times to get 10 bucks? Insane.   The Village Pub had a moment...a moment where it was the best food in a 3 mile radius. Now Rex never goes there. Rex can't. The memories of what was saddens him...and a sad Rex is a urinating Rex."}
{"text":"We had potatoe skins as a appetizer, it was little burn and hard on the bottom for the potato.  Service was slow. Seen like only waitress is working the whole floor.   I had the chicken fried chicken with mash potato and franch fries was really good."}
{"text":"We get a lot of takeout from here.  Every time we call whoever answers the phone is always so nice and patient taking our order. Today I ordered a chef salad $9.49. It was very good, fresh and big but not obnoxious.  The turkey, ham and cheese is  cut into the perfect sizes.  My husband ordered the Monday special;1/2 chicken (choice of plain, bbq or lemon garlic), mashed potatoes and veggies plus soup or salad. They have daily specials and soups all very reasonably priced. They do charge $2.00 for their daily specials on to go orders but the specials are so reasonably priced it's not a big deal. So a chef salad, large soup, a huge 1/2 chicken dinner w/salad was around  $24. Why cook?"}
{"text":"An unfortunate event with our airplane left us stranded an extra day in Las Vegas. The airline provided vouchers for a small pub near our hotel. Driving to Village Pub, we figured \"free food, so we won't judge,\" but it wound up being excellent! Service was on point, my salad and the burger my husband ordered were delicious, and the music and atmosphere were relaxing. Just what we needed after a stressful day! We aim to cone back if we find ourselves stranded in Vegas again."}
{"text":"The village pub is your typical pub. I specifically went in to try the chicken fried chicken. Total throw back comfort food from my youth!  The good... portions were big, price was good, potatoes and veggies were real. Down side... no country gravy!  The gravy they used was way over salted, and the chicken a bit bland. Over-all not a bad experience, enjoyed grabbing a cocktail in the bar area, and I appreciated the fact that the dining area is separate from the bar. I will go back."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this Village Pub location. From the friendly staff and generous portions to the tasty food and nightly specials. We have ordered the french onion soup (excellent), fish & chips (amazing), french dip (excellent), ham steak & eggs with country potatoes (very good), BBQ bacon burger (excellent), ribs (excellent) and I really like their steak fries and potato salad. The Monday night special of a half a baked chicken with 2 sides is perfect. The drinks are poured well and the bartenders are the nicest around. This place has the best customer service around and they strive to make you happy."}
{"text":"Okay, plain and simple. These guys are totally cool, if you want to come in and have the time of your life stop by at any time. The prime rib on Saturday night is off the hook. The service is excellent and awesome five and great Mojo. And by the way you can ask for a great bartender named Raul and the service is excellent and the machines pay out."}
{"text":"Pure slop.  I was so excited when I realized this is the company that owns Ellis Island.  I go there all the time.  I ordered fish and chips and it was disgusting.  The waitress dropped the food off without asking if I needed anything else and I did.  When she came back to check on me I told her the fish was burnt and the fries were greasy, and she asked if I wanted the cook to make another order, but I told her I did not have time.  I tried to pick around it.  A decent waitress would not have allowed it to hit the table, and maybe even bought me a soda while I waited for it to be cooked again.  She did not come back to give me the check or check on me again, and I saw her sitting at the bar. I left $15 on the table, tried to get anyone's attention in the dead bar, but really, they are focused on anything but customer service.  While waiting for the food, I sent a text to my friends saying instead of going to Ichabods next time, lets come here.  There is NO WAY I will ever return.  Trust me when I tell you Ichabods is an 11, and it is just kitty corner to this dump.  Village Pub is a 1.  Village Pub does not separate the restaurant from the bar so if you do not smoke, another reason to skip this place."}
{"text":"Cheap awesome fish n chips. That's all I have ever tried there and that's all I will probably ever try there. Place always looks like a retirement home. It's got bad 80's coffee shop motif. But like I said, for great fish n chips for like $8, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I went here every night after work *I'm a casino blackjack dealer) I always came in for the happy hour. I always loved this place, loved the food, loved the service. Till, one night I came in. The bartender wouldn't let me order the happy hour prices. Even though,  it WAS happy hour and I came here about 5 nights a week. When the bartender wouldn't give me the price, I told him to cancel my food order so I could leave. He gave me the bill immediately and told me that if I didn't pay full price, I would be banded forever. I literally left, and despite my favorite food., will never return again. :("}
{"text":"Food is great here ... haven't had a bad meal. Especially exceptional - Pot roast, pork chops and chicken fried chicken. Everyone I bring here enjoy their meal. Bus help- Paul and Makana great - fast friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Horrible service - rude as if we were suppose to be serving her instead. Food was less than desirable with exception of chicken fried chicken. Hostess - only friendly person. Would NOT Recommend"}
{"text":"I was very dissapoint this was a very good spot for me and my friend and outta the last 2 times I've been there the food was terrible and I had instant a  stomach ach."}
{"text":"Steak and egg special is a deal. New for me is that the condiments are on the tables now. No longer waiting for a server. That annoyance is gone."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best lunches I've had in a long, long time. Ordered the soup of the day (chili, today) & salad. It came with garlic bread and was exactly what the doctor ordered.  The chili was the best part of it all. Not skimpy, at all. Great recipe. It was my first time in one of these bars/restaurants and it felt like an episode of Cheers from the very first moment I sat down.  Very kind waitress apologized for the wait on the food and was the highlight of my whole experience. Bummed I did not get her name, but she is a winner. Terrifically attentive service, friendly people at the bar, and good value overall. Will return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Great service here every time I come. Today, Robin was tending bar, and she was so friendly! She also made the best piña coladas.   I highly recommend their potato skins--they're hot fresh and loaded with cheddar cheese, sour cream, chives, & bacon. Everything else I've had here was also delicious.  Great atmosphere--I love the sofas and flat screens on the back. There's also a separate dining area and free WiFi!"}
{"text":"Located on Sunset near Mountain Vista is the 24 hours bar and restaurant Village Pub. I really like the throwback decor in here, the dining room on the right has old world paintings of Spanish Galleons and other wooden ships in ocean battle. I've been to 3 Village Pubs in the area and this dining room has the best character so far. I guess you can say it's very dated, but who cares? It's not your hotel room, it's a place to grab some good eats and go. The Spanish lady there is really nice, very prompt and excellent service! When I go to the Galaxy theater to see a movie on Friday morning (when they play something I want to see), I will stop in for a quick breakfast. The food never lets you down, always cooked perfectly and a great value for the money. If I had a complaint it would be the eggs are often a bit too runny, but I'll order it scrambled so that flaw can be overlooked. Don't let the run down shopping center fool you, this Village Pub is alive and kicking inside."}
{"text":"Great locals hangout and open 24/7. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and numerous daily specials to select from. We had breakfast this morning and the service was really good. I had the chicken fried chicken, eggs, toast and sweet potato tots. Lana had steak and eggs. Everything was prepared promptly and fresh. Only slight drawback was the breading on my chicken fried chicken was a little overly salty and Lana said her steak lacked seasoning, so one item over salted and one item under seasoned, but still a great place for breakfast. We've dined here many times when it was Timbers and it was good and now as Village Pub it's even better. The fish and chips are a standard and the BBQ Ribs is something we'll try sometime soon. Kind of an out of the way location, but try it out. It's never over crowded and the service is very good. The man today in the black Chef's coat, Jon was a great host! He really cared about your comfort and was always checking on us. Check out the specials on the blackboard it has some great values. Also happy hour 11pm to 3 am and 3pm to 6pm daily. Prices are great, but the happy hour prices makes it even better. Our breakfast this morning, Chicken Fried Chicken, Steak and Eggs, with two coffees was $20 and change! I'll give you $20, go to the grocery store and try to recreate this breakfast, it can't be done. Village Pub, 215 and Gibson/American Pacific in Henderson. Check them out anytime! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Hmm I'd love to give this place a higher rating, but one of their \"company policies\" holds me back. On Christmas, after spending the day with family a few friends and I decided to hit up our local bar for some after Christmas libations... and after a few hours we found ourselves very hungry. I guess eating non-stop for the last few days had our tummies trained. Unfortunately, the kitchen was closed for xmas so the bartender recommended Village Pub and this was the closest location. I downloaded the menu and called to confirm takeout. I spoke to Jamie on the phone and she informed me that she could not take my order over the phone. I would have to come down in person before she could take the order. This was really frustrating as we were only a few blocks down the street and it would have been nice to place the order, so that when I arrived it would be ready. I had already volunteered to go pick it up. Completely inconvenient to wait until I arrive to be able to place the order and then sit at the bar while the food is made. I was appreciative that they were serving food on Christmas, but this company policy will limit my return in the future, regardless of how good the food.   Another complaint that I had... I ordered the Prime Rib Special at$15.99, but was informed that there would be a $2.00 up charge for takeout. I don't really understand the logic behind a $2.00 up charge on the special, especially because it was more expensive that either of the other entrees ordered (Steak and Shrimp $12.99 or Chicken Parmesan $12.49) I was also charged $.50 for cheese on my baked potato. I just feel like this is all in poor taste.   Once I arrived at the bar, Jamie was very friendly. She made me a $4 Vodka/Water while I waited for the food. Obviously, I don't hold her accountable since she informed me this was all company policy... I mean you can't really argue with that.   As far as the food, it was ok. We were hungry and it definitely did the job. I did appreciate that Jamie or the kitchen staff made sure to include creamy horseradish for my prime rib and extra sour cream for my baked potato. There was also lemon that we assumed was for the fish. That was a very nice touch.   Staff and Food = 4 stars, Company Policy = 2 stars. Overall = 3 stars."}
{"text":"Oh. Hi fried French toast. You must order th French toast that is on the specials menu. It is soooooooooOoooOOoOoO gooooooooood. Happy cunchy good and it soaks th \"maple\" syrup and it stays crunchy (because it.s fried!). The chicken pot pie is absolutely amazing- creamy, crunchy, w a giant buttery poofy crust. Btw $2.50 spicy bloody Mary's ?! That was delicious too! Go."}
{"text":"A family friendly bar with seperate dining, great food, and great prices. Love their dinner specials!"}
{"text":"My third time here. First time just to stop by for a quick breakfast. Second time last Friday for a well deserved cocktail and the bartender Sally was mucho accommodating plus I won money...bonus . Today I decided to stop in for lunch and met Shauntel. What a super amazing bartender!! I use to be a bartender for years and it's hard to come by a good one. I was greeted with a very warm hello and smile, then told her I'd be right back because I needed to get my coat out of my car and without hesitation she said \"no, here wear my sweater!\". If your in the industry or have ever been...you know a GREAT bartender. I've been here for the past three hours and her smile, energy and mojo hasn't changed at all to every patron here!! I found my new home away from home. This could be a really good or bad thing. Lol. But don't miss out on coming here and being treated like royalty."}
{"text":"While I wouldn't give any other Village Pub this low of a rating, this one was off its game. The beer was not fresh. I had a stout that was just bad, and I had to exchange it for another beer. On top of that, the beers apparently cost more at this location versus the other locations. The food arrived lukewarm, which is a huge annoyance to me. This particular visit just left a bad taste in my mouth, leaving me not wanting to visit any Village Pub for a long while."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. The steak and eggs is an incredible buy @ $6.99, but it's not on the menu so be sure to ask. I've been here 4 to 5 Saturdays in a row, and the food is always first rate.  The Southwestern skillet dish is wonderful if you like your breakfast on the spicy side. Great wait staff as well, very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The fish was only okay. The following things were just not good. Chips overdone. I asked for nothing to be on STYROFOAM, when will restaurants realize that using styrofoam is dangerous to health. I said put on foil they did part of order that way. My potato salad . IN STYRFOAM why? the drinks in styrofoam. The garlic bread my husband had had no taste was dry. The potato skins nearly burned bacon in them burnt. Yuck. I've eaten at the Village Pub up on Sunset, their food has always been good. Will not order from these again."}
{"text":"Our food was great, Kim our server was awesome, She was very attentive and provided great service! Thank you, Kim!"}
{"text":"Didn't get any help, couldn't order a drink or food. Won't waste my time again. 20 minutes just got up and left without even one server talking to me."}
{"text":"I usually don't like ale's but the Winter spiced ale is good Grilled chicken with spinach, portabello mushroom & rice pilaf tasty!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several locations around the valley and this one is no different. Slow and inconsistent service, over cooked food, and the atmosphere of a dungeon.  I ordered the fish and chips, which were reasonably well priced at $9.99. After waiting for the cook to fly to the coast and catch my fish, I finally got my order (about 25 minutes), I got a plate of over cooked, dark brown batter balls. The fries were cooked well but the fish looked and smelled like it had been cooked in grease that was a month old. The batter was very thick and the fish inside was VERY dry. Dipping the fish in Tatar sauce, I was able to eat a piece of fish but could not do any more than that. Overall, NOT a good place to eat. Bad service, bad food, and a bad atmosphere. 0 for 3. Try it for yourself and kick yourself later or read my words and avoid a bad meal and bad experience."}
{"text":"I Absolutely Love this Village Pub! Me & my husband come here at least twice a week! The Staff are so Friendly & they Treat you like family  They have bar food like chicken wings & potato skins, And Yummy Burgers & fries And Every day is a different Daily Specials (Dinners) With a different Soup You can't go wrong with Anything you Eat here! I am from back East So we are use to Diners & This place reminds us of a Diner from Back home You Gotta try it! Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"This rating is long overdue. I used to work at a different location so I know the quality of the food and the work that goes into the prep. I come to this locations for the great service, chicken fingers, steak special (breakfast is only 6.99 ), the chicken fried chicken and 2.50 mimosas. Can't go wrong with an Ellis island draft either."}
{"text":"The only dish we have tried here is the Fish & Chips. It is so good that I don't want to order anything else. They use Icelandic Cod which I prefer over the Alaskan variety found at most restaurants here. It has a sweeter taste with large, soft flakes that melt in your mouth. Generous portions at a good price."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner... Best ribs around !!  A lot easier than going to Ellis Island !!!  Staff is great too !"}
{"text":"I'm going to start this off by saying that normally, I love this place. I live walking distance from here and frequent them at least once a week. This particular review is for one specific visit that just turned me off so much, I'm going to take a break from being a patron.  During Football season my friends and I like to come here to watch, especially the morning games on Sunday. The game specials are great! And we spend a few hours there for a great price. Not to mention the morning bartender is wonderful and we can't wait to come back.  This past Sunday my team was playing the 5:30pm game, so the regular staff we're used to wasn't there, but we've had this bartender before and we put our orders in which came out in a timely manner. The issues started when the rest of our party arrived and things started picking up in the game.  The extra 3 people at my table put in there orders within 5 minutes of arriving; drinks came out quick, all was hunky dory. Then a few minutes later one of the teams scored a touchdown and a party across the bar cheered loudly for a moment and laughed because the rest of the bar was quiet. We laughed as well because we were cheering for the opposite team, then this was when things got weird?  The bartender (who is mentioned in another review concerning the same game) seriously scolded the cheering party for being \"too loud\" and said this wasn't a \"PTs or Kopper Keg\". Excuse me? You're a bar that has the game on THREE SCREENS one of which is a HUGE PROJECTION SCREEN. No one had complained, and in fact aside from my party and their party, there were a total of 3 other people in the bar, who also said out loud \"None of us complained\".  Needless to say this bartender acting this way was a total buzzkill, and not to mention my friends had waited almost 30 minutes for an order of chili cheese fries and 25 wings. Seriously?  We left and went to PTs since the bartender suggested it, and I like to be loud and actually be able to CHEER A FOOTBALL GAME without being scolded like a child. I will not be coming back when she's at the bar, you can guarantee that."}
{"text":"I love this bar!   Chris, Renee and Rory are all competent, attentive and welcoming bartenders. Fresh drinks are easy to get, and once you establish what you drink, you'll rarely have to ask; finish one, another appears. Ashtrays are emptied as quickly as a butt is crushed into them.  The Ellis Island (their parent organization) beers are all eminently drinkable, from the IPA to the Light with all the relevant stops in between represented. You aren't going to find a bunch of boutique nonsense on tap here, so if that's your gig, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you like beer for beer's sake, you owe it to yourself to give their taps a whirl. Plus, it's made here, and has been since WAY before it was commonplace.  And then there's the Egg Nog. It is a revelation, and an amazing way to warm up on a chilly Winter night. Creamy, smooth and it packs enough of a kick that you'll be crooning like Bing Crosby in no time! Stop in for a glass and TAKE A BOTTLE HOME, the revelers at your holiday parties will thank you.  As others have mentioned, the food is solid across the board. The Chicken Pot Pie (easily serves two) and the French Onion Soup are go-to choices, and the recent addition of Soft Pretzels with a delicious beer/cheese sauce is a no-brainier when catching up with friends over drinks.  In a town with, seemingly, a bar in every omnipresent strip-mall, these guys outshine the competition handily. If you live in the area and this isn't your Local (with on acceptable exception) you're missing out, big time."}
{"text":"This place is a shabby looking place that looked like it had its heyday in the '50s. It's dark and looks like it might have been elegant many decades ago. The waiter was very, very friendly and upbeat, but the service was slow and poor. It took us 1.75 hours for what should have taken us 45 minutes. It took about 15 minutes for our order to be taken. It took about 20 for my dining partner to get his salad. By the time our food finally came, we were starving. The steak was ordered medium, but showed up as well done and, although tasty, had the texture of shoe leather."}
{"text":"Has a dark, shabby feel of someplace that had their heyday in the '50s. Very super slow service. The place wasn't even that full of people. But the server was slow AND forgetful. We (and other customers) had to ask for things more than once. A meal that should have only taken 45 minutes to an hour took two hours, due to the slow service.  We were seated right away, because you're allowed to seat yourself. We got menus in about 5 minutes. It was another 20 minutes or so before our order was taken. Then, the real waiting began. You know the jokes, \"They're waiting for the chicken to hatch.\" Etc. The chicken pot pie was LOADED with peas. It had WAY too many peas. Otherwise, it was good, but definitely not worth the wait. My dining partner had a steak. He said it tasted okay, but he ordered it medium and it was clearly well done. He said it also was chewy like shoe leather. We ordered a scoop of ice cream for dessert. How long does it take to get a scoop of ice cream? Apparently, it takes a really, really long time. The employees were chatting it up when they could have been scooping the dang ice cream. Also, said ice cream, when it finally came, it had to be the cheapest brand they could find. It was just not right. Couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast pretty much every weekend, very disappointed in the switch to \"non-dairy product\" instead of half and half. I'll have to think about switching my breakfast place, not a fan of the corn syrup and palm oil sludge."}
{"text":"Used to love this place on east side so when we moved behind in Nv trails we were thrilled. First time fish and chips so greasy it gagged us.  Second time tried chicken dinner..tasted good but we both got sick. Next time tried chicken pot pies.. all onions and celery.. again we got sick.  That cinched it. Service was terrible..slow and non attentive. Have not gone back."}
{"text":"Exactly what I wanted...yummy fish and chips, 2$ hefewiezen at happy hour and excellent service!"}
{"text":"The best soup ever. They make their soups from scratch each day. The clam chowder is fabulous. It's cold right now. Perfect soup weather."}
{"text":"I'd been to the bar a few times and it was decent enough but coming for dinner tonight was a huge mistake. Our server Erick provided horrible service. He was incredibly unhelpful, forgot items we ordered or brought wrong stuff, didn't refill drinks and WORSE of all a few bites in when he stopped by to ask how the meal is tasting we pointed out that the ribs were terribly over cooked (basically pork jerky and very unpleasant) his response was \"sorry to hear that\" and he walked away. Ummm K, thanks for asking?   The Taco salad and fried pickles were pretty tasty though but the fish and chips were bland, fries were burnt and the French onion soup was gross. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've never lived in Henderson/Green Valley, but have been to a couple of the village pubs around town. I've never been to any more than once, but it always seemed to me they were dark, and the bartenders were always incredibly attentive. They have microbrews on tap instead of standard fare, but I can dig it. The food is mostly great! I haven't had anything bad, just one dish was kinda oily. They have $2 happy hour specials, half price apps. I don't know about the restaurant, but in the bar area, everyone has been ridiculously good looking. When the cooks come out to serve me my dinner, I start drooling for reasons unrelated to food. ;) And if you're into machines, it seems to be pretty good. They've held onto some of the OOOOOLD school Gamblers Bonus machines.  You can bet up to 100 units on the blackjack and double down on things other than \"11\", so that's super dope, if you're into that. It's definitely an older crowd too."}
{"text":"Every meal I have here is good.  I love the pancakes and breakfast burrito.  The staff is very nice and helpful (love Donna Jo), the service is great and the price is right.  :)"}
{"text":"Back for more Chicken Wings...changed the wing. Now medium as opposed to large. Still good, but I feel it necessary to update my review as not to mislead anybody. I'm guessing the procurement department inserted themselves into the buying process and cut back on the size of the wings....     Back to Village Pub.   Still 5 stars!  Had the Chicken Wings.   Biggest, juiciest I have had in as long as I can remember. $8.50!    First thing they asked was whether I wanted naked or battered. WOW!  Really don't like battered wings like Hooters does.  Too much batter, not enough chicken. Great that they offer the option.   So big I could hardly finish the last one!  Really juicy. Don't wear your good tie."}
{"text":"The food here is ok, nothing great and you definitely get a large portion if thats what you are looking for. It's pretty much diner style food served in a bar. A bar that allows smoking, so plan for a smoke filled dining experience if you dine at this location. That was enough for me to not want to come back here, it was hard to get past the smokey atmosphere, not a fan"}
{"text":"First time here for me, third time for my guy. We both had the steak special, 9.95$ with a baked potato, season veggies & soup or salad. Great taste with a great price!!! I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible service we were literally sitting there for 20 min and not one person came or even acknowledged us and it was not busy what so ever. Never again with this place"}
{"text":"We go here every Saturday and sit in the bar area for brunch. The bartender Shauntel is the best ever. She knows us, our order, makes our drinks and puts the order in each time expertly. We actually like the entire staff there as well. I get the same thing every time, the Loaded Skillet with eggs over medium and sour dough toast. She also makes us a mean bloody mary, which are only $2.50. This is one of the only places I know in Vegas where you can smoke while you are waiting and eat a great breakfast to boot."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times, it's actually our favorite place now.  Everything we've tried so far has been delicious and very inexpensive.  You can get breakfast, lunch and dinner, and they serve different specials every day.  Service is good too."}
{"text":"Very clean but definitely geared towards an older senior type crowd.  Nobody talks to eachother and seems very sterile ... bartenders are nice and food is good."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  One waitress, are you serious.  Will never come back.  We came with a party of 8.  Restaurant unable to accommodate us to sit together.  Not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Never real busy. Always been a good dinner. Nice for a weekday meal, nothing fancy, just a good dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place normally... However our server Leslie did not care at all about customer service, she was in a hurry the whole time and the place wasn't even busy. She did not even come over to fill our drinks or even for us to ask for a napkin. Very disappointed and this will probably stop me from coming here again"}
{"text":"We 3 arrived at 7:00pm on a Friday and were seated right away, although it was busy.  It looked like they were short staffed so we were patient, but we had to flag down the waitress after 20 minutes to order our food.  The food then took an HOUR to get to us - maybe the kitchen was short staffed too?  The food was average, although my friend's potpie had breaded chicken in it!  The atmosphere looked a bit dim - like an Italian place, and there was a bar with gambling attached (luckily behind glass doors)."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this place mostly for the monday special which is a half chicken dinner now priced at 7.49.   When it was 5.99 years ago, half of Sun City were lining up out the doors.   Now I guess the place is just not as packed.   We decided to have a BURGER instead of the chicken.   However, they have TWO parts to the burger section on the menu.   One is a Make your own additions to the burger each 50 cents for $5.99 and another section below for different prices which come from 7.99 and up.   These have certain items such as bacon, bleu cheese, jaleponos etc.      I just wanted a burger, medium rare with cheddar cheese and my husband just wanted it plain.   We asked what does it come with and it has a choice of steak fries, potato salad, coleslaw etc.      I failed to ask what also comes on the burger.   When we got the burgers, I looked for the cheese and found a small melted quarter size spot on the burger, lettuce and two slices of tomato and a pickle on the side.   The burger was slightly pink, I like it rarer, and was very thin although it was supposed to be 1/2 pound.   It was also VERY dry tasting.      When we got the bill I asked the server, what happened to the cheese? She said she ordered it with cheese, but I couldn't even see 2 cents worth.    Then we saw we were charged 7.99 and 8.50.     She said because it came with lettuce and tomato, we were charged extra.   What a rip off!   Burger bun just okay.  will NEVER order a burger there again!"}
{"text":"I mean really.. Whats not to like about the Pub?  When I find out Ill make sure to post it.. Until then this is mine and my husbands go to spot for just about anything.. The prices used to be alot cheaper but I can live with it.. The burgers are good.. The chicken fingers good.. The chicken fried steak and the chicken parm Yum Yum.. The desserts ain't too shabby either"}
{"text":"There must be a story why they located a Village Pub in this location, unless you noticed the sign, you would never know it was here.  Nevertheless, on par with the other Village Pub locations.  If you're a night owl, highly recommend pressing the magic buzzer and gaining entrance.  Bartenders are friendly and unpretentious, it's pretty quiet and low key, most items on the menu are available.  Solid choice."}
{"text":"Since my last review, think I've visited all of the Village Pubs in Henderson, Las Vegas, and Summerlin, multiple times.  Reasonable prices, decent food (not goin' knock your socks off, but \"safe\" and ok), casual, non-smoking areas.  All the Village Pubs tend to be consistent in quality, offerings and prices, except the usual high airport prices found at the one in Terminal 3 of the airport.  Also, the food quality at Ellis Island (another Village Pub), just east of the strip, is consistently below par of that of the other Village Pubs--if you enjoy their crafted beer, however, Ellis Island in the bar is the place to go (currently $2.50 for 20oz craft beer--the other Village Pubs charge $4 or so, except at Happy Hour).  On this visit to the Sunset location, had the Southwestern Skillet, with diced grilled chicken, [huge amount of] jalapenos, onions, poblano peppers and topped with three eggs cooked any style, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese, charred tomato salsa and sour cream.  $8.29.  Pik attached.  Was good, the excess jalapenos notwithstanding, but think for breakfast I'd stick with their steak and eggs special which is offered every day for $6.99."}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed at all, still unpretentious, reasonably priced and good food.  The steak and eggs (pik attached) still one of the best deals in Vegas, $6.99 plus tax = $7.57.  Drafts are $4, higher than at Ellis Island (they just raised the price there from $2.25 to $2.50) but still a great price.  Servers, bartenders all down to earth and friendly."}
{"text":"Met some friends here at lunch on a Saturday. The place was not busy. The service was prompt and courteous. We started in the bar area because my friends smoke. The bartender was nice. We ate in the dining room. The food is very reasonably priced! I had a BLT with potato salad for less than $7! It was good and not a double decker. Lots of bacon. One friend had the french dip with fries and she said it was good. The bread looked awesome. My other friend had a side salad and onion rings. The side salad was huge! And there were nice crunchy croutons. The onion rings looked really good - the batter was a nice golden brown. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Best bar food and staff in town! Clam chowder on Friday and prime rib Saturday is a must!"}
{"text":"11pm-3am happy hour...need I say more?!  I've always gone to PT's for drinks, but they continue to shorten their happy hour, which is now only 2 hours long. Additionally, all drinks are no longer 50% off.   At this location, the bar itself is not the largest and it does not have pool tables, however, the price of drinks should be reason enough to come here. Their draft beers, house wines and certain liquors are $2 and appetizers are 1/2 off!   The next time I decide to have a get together with friends for drinks, this is the place I'll be choosing."}
{"text":"We always go to the Pub on Eastern in Henderson. The food is usually great but at this one it sucks! We ordered 3 steak specials all rare. Each one came out different. One was so raw it didn't even have grill marks on it. We had to wait 20 mins for drink refills. I wouldn't suggest this location to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the best meals you can find in Vegas at the most affordable price!!!  I've been to this Village Pub more than 5 times. Every time I eat here the food is consistent, the service friendly and prompt, and the beer excellent! I'm the hugest fan of Ellis Island brews which you can get at all Village Pubs in the city at a price that feels like you are stealing. My favorite is to come to this pub for breakfast. I love their omelets and steak & eggs. They also serve Ellis Island's famous steak special, which I order here also. The prices can't be beat on the menu, and the quality of food is always consistent and above average. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best feel good restaurant in all of Nevada. I brought my 96 year old dad to live with us and from his very first visit there they made him feel like a King! Needless to say in the last 9 months we have eaten there 4 to 5 times a week. The waitresses are the most caring, cheerful and thoughtful ladies on planet earth. When they see us coming through the door they already are placing our beverages on our special table. Eating at the Pub is like going to your best friends house for dinner. The food is delicious but it is the service that keeps us coming back. A very special shout out to the fabulous Veronica!"}
{"text":"Eggs were good, as was the service, coffee, Bloody Marys and toast. The o'brians lacked much because they were mostly potatoes, and the hash was cut out of tube (I had an end piece) and just warmed and served. Come on... fry that hash up and brown it, for heaven's sake.  There's reasons the food is inexpensive. There's nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Love their ribs!  They did change the garlic bread to one that isn't as good, but I just throw it away and eat the ribs.  Very nice, friendly employees."}
{"text":"I'm amazed that there are reviews with 1 and 2 stars because all the Village Pub's in the city are the best at what they do: GREAT FOOD!  If you've ever been to PT's or any other local bar/casino/restaurant you'll find that the Pub is about 1000 times better.  And yes, its a bar/restaurant, darkly lit, woodsy, with cool old fashioned booths and chairs.  Steak Fries: the best in the entire state.  In fact there are no better fries anywhere.  Cobb Salad: it's huge and better than the Cheese Cake Factory, which is 2nd only to The Pub.  Turkey Burger: if you don't eat red meat and have to make a choice, choose the turkey burger.  Simply amazing and there is no better in the entire city, Las Vegas included.  Fried Chicken: if you've had the fried chicken at the Rio Buffet or Tuscany (which is the best in the city) this is just as good.  All about that buttermilk batter I think.  ***And finally but not to be forgotten: Fried Shrimp - undeniably the best and I'm comparing to any restaurant in the city, even $40 a plate places.  Nice big awesome shrimp!  All about that batter.  Really, you can't go wrong.    Oh and since a lot of the bad reviews have to do with time problems, if you're in such a  huge rush, go and get some crappy fast food and waste someone else's time.  I'm sure everyone will appreciate it.   This place is great and the staff is super friendly and fun."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that's it's fair that I review this place, because we didn't actually eat here. Heck, we didn't even sit down. We walked in on a Friday night around 7 for dinner. Inside smelled like a hospital and when we found our way down the hallway, there were probably 6 tables out of 30 filled, and everyone there was eligible for a Medicare card.   We didn't stay."}
{"text":"This is Village Pub's newest location, tucked into a little center with a taco shop and a storage facility on Bermuda between Pyle and Cactus.  (The address on their website gives you the wrong area - the address I've given is correct.)  The food here is great - MUCH better than you'd expect from a pub.  It's always plated very nicely, with garnishes and finishing touches that you wouldn't expect at this price.  This place is famous for their fish and chips, and with good reason.  Three HUGE pieces of fish with a mound of fries that's easily big enough to share.  They always seem to have a couple of steak specials in addition to their daily specials.  I've never had a bad steak (or even a mediocre one) here - always tender and juicy, and cooked just perfectly!  On our last visit, my husband tried the Pub Pot Pie - a hulking puff pastry covered crock of chicken-y goodness and vegetables.  It was absolutely amazing.  According to their website, they're introducing new menu items at this location, but the regular menu is still fabulous.  This is the kind of place where you'll get to know your server over the course of the meal and probably the folks next to your table as well.  The food is better and the prices lower than other pubs in this area and the atmosphere is more like a restaurant than a bar.  The service is always attentive and friendly, and I doubt that will change much once the word gets out and this location gets busier.  In the meantime, Village Pub is high on our list of favorite places to go when we want a great meal close to home."}
{"text":"By Far one of the best Gaming Bars and Family Restaurants in Las Vegas! The Bar is separated from the Restaurant for the convenience of Family's and Non smokers! Also one of the best Happy Hours in town. Between 3pm-6pm and 11-3am, Ellis Island Micro Brew Drafts are $2.50, Well and Call drinks are half off, and Amazing Appetizers are 1/2 off as well. The Bartender Danny is super awesome, He is so hospitable, he definitely gives the best service in town ;)  The Restaurant side is great as well, I usually sit in the restaurant for breakfast on the weekends, The Steak and Eggs and Bloody Marys are amazing!  As far as food, Ive ordered from both the Bar and restaurant, Everything has always came out great, The Fish N Chips, the Meatball Sliders, the Ribs, Its all good here I have not a single complaint about this place!"}
{"text":"Total crap.  The food here was so bad, I wouldn't feed it to my dog.  I wouldn't feed to to my neighbor's dog who barks constantly and bites children. Well...maybe I would.  Death by shit food."}
{"text":"GO SEE JOHN! He is AWESOME! such great service ! I'm giving 5 stars because of him! We dropped in on him at 2 am with 10 people and he had a smile on his face , helped answer questions on the menu, my drink was never empty and helped customize my order for me!! Such a great server.. it's so nice to have someone who is kind and helpful at this time of night. Thank you john!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good coffee shop type restaurant that is conveniently located in the middle of Desert Shores.  If you've never been to Desert Shores, you may have a hard time finding this place, especially in the dark.  Big trees, streets that go in circles, and relatively poor signage all contribute.  If you use Apple Maps, you'll probably end up in Brazil.  I've come here a few times, mostly for breakfast/brunch.  The decor is, well, dated.  The service is generally quite good.  I've not sat in the bar, but that is the Casino section of this place and they do allow smoking there.  The dining area is separate and well lit.  More than a few ramps/stairs, so watch your step in the dining area.  My breakfast fav is the Country Eggs Benedict: \"Two flaky buttermilk biscuit halves topped with sausage patties, two eggs cooked any style and homemade country sausage gravy.\"  Eggs Benedict in name, only.  Well, it does have eggs.  Mighty tasty if you like sausage gravy.  It is not too sweet, not too peppery, and not too creamy.  Goldilocks & baby bear would really like it.  Fun tip: Switch out fries for sweet potato tots.  They be yummy.  I've also had chili dogs & chicken fingers, 2.5 stars and 3.5 stars, respectively.  They also have some late night specials and I will do a review update of  happy hour & late dining, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Always solid lunch choice. Staff is super nice. I like that the location on Gibson has separate dining from bar area. This review is on the fish and chips. Very good. I always have great luck with their fish and it's firm and flakey. Very good. They steal fries are very good as well. The tartar sauce to me has a hint of green onion which I'm not a fan of but it's better with hot sauce added anyway. All good ! Go try them out for food or cocktails."}
{"text":"Yes, places like these are a dime a dozen to anyone familiar with the Vegas valley.  But to the locals, and those that visit enough to experience the locals side of Vegas will know that Village Pub & Poker is the exception!  From the moment you walk in you notice the British vibe that parallels to a old school Vegas vibe.  Dark paneling with dark red leather booths are the norm, and the smell of good food hitting you in the nostrils.  Everything here is good from the Fish & Chips, Prime Rib, BBQ Ribs, Burgers, and pasta dishes.  This visit I had the Prime Rib and BBQ Ribs.  The Prime Rib was cooked to a medium rare perfection, and the ribs literally fell off the bone with little effort!  The wait staff was extraordinary in the efforts to make our party of nine feel welcome.  We even brought in a birthday cake for which they stored and served for us!  A lot of years of coming here, and here's to many more trips to Village Pub!"}
{"text":"The bar staff is very nice. Food..is not as what it used to be! Lacks flavor and seasoning"}
{"text":"The food is delicious the environment is nice I come here with friends often.. however the so called bartender server I had tonight IS NOT .. It's like we were a bother to him 1) before we ordered he made his negative comment \"not everything on the dinner menu is available in such a rude way as if he didn't want to help us and it was an inconvenience  \" 2) he never refilled my drink which was non alcoholic .. I had to ask him for one he looked at me walked away got my refill put it down without a word 3) I was trying to add to my order and As I asked him if the item was available his attitude was harsh with a comment of do you want it or not cause I would have to go ask really that's how you talk to a guest ?!?!? Instead of let me check for you if we can make it ..4) I asked for change 4 5's or 2 10's whichever is easier he said well which one is it after I just said whatever is easier did I stutter ?!? ... Then as I was playing the machine he drops my food order off says nothing doesn't even give me silverware or later bother asking if everything is ok he sees I didn't touch it didn't even check on me nor offered a to go box ..  What the hell kind of service is that ?!? I really didn't care much for his behavior or service and I seriously didn't want to tip him cause he deserves to be stiffed with that shitty attitude .. But unfortunately he was tipped more than the average 15percent my bill share was $25 I left $40 for my share .. The worse part I was watching him with the other people and he had the sweetest attitude but was a prick to me and my friends .. How he works in the service industry is unbelievable with that attitude .. Since I don't drink I'm gonna assume the other people that can tolerate his shitty attitude must be overlooking it they do say the more you drink the ugly people tend to look good in your eyes .. An ugly attitude makes him a ugly person !!  Don't get me wrong tho the place has other employees I like the other 3 that taken care of me and my friends before are great friendly and not a prick .. It's like I felt discriminated with his ass the way he treated me !!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, on both the bar side and the restaurant side. The service is good and the restaurant usually has better than average bar food. Today I had puffy pecan french toasr, which was a bit of a disappointment. It was a little oily and very heavy. My boyfriend has the steak and eggs. It was a decent sized steak, cooked as ordered and served with breakfast potatoes and eggs. The prices are reasonable, our check was $16.00. Despite the one miss step with the French toast, this is a solid bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the Pub!  Mainly go for breakfast. Bacon and eggs are great. Not many places in town give 4 slices of bacon. Eggs cooked to order and alway treated like family. Service is great and April is there with a smile. Keeps coffee filled and is always attentive to me and her tables throughout the restaurant.  If you want to feel welcomed and have a nice breakfast the Pub is where you'll find it."}
{"text":"This Village Pub & Poker is located near the Valley Automall in Henderson. It's location is also near a neighborhood and Touro University, it's a pretty busy area but good for business. I like to drop in to this Village Pub every so often to always get great customer service and good food.   Some of the food I've had here included but limited to, their Fish & Chips, chicken fried chicken, dinner salad, onion rings, and steak fries. I gotta say one of my fav's is their Fish & Chips. I've been to other places where it's been just OK but this Village Pub cooks it very delicious in taste, flaky and crisp just right.   Their Fish & Chips are made with Icelandic Cod, this  might be the reason why it's so good and I tend to find myself going back for more. But all-in-all I've haven't received nothing but really good customer service here and the wait, if there is any, has always been short on their pretty busy days. I'll be back for more food, maybe trying something different for a slight change. I like this place!"}
{"text":"There are a few foods that I just love, and one of them is sweet potatoes. We specifically went to Village Pub for lunch so that I could try their tater tots made with sweet potatoes. Yes, that is right. SWEET POTATER TOTS. That's what they are called on the menu, I can't make this stuff up!   We sat in a booth in the bar area, our waitress was the bartender. She had someone helping her bring our drinks but otherwise it was just her helping multiple people at the bar as well as another table in addition to ours. She did a great job of making sure we never waited too long for anything.   I had the club sandwich, which came with my choice of fries or tots (they also had onion rings as an option, those were an additional charge) and a pickle spear. It was a pretty basic sandwich, the bacon was nice and crispy but the star of my meal was the tots, without a doubt. Slightly smaller then the standard tots I am used to, great consistency and super yummy.   3 stars for being an A-OK, inexpensive pub to grab a bite to eat. Plus 1 star for the sweet potater tots. As long as they keep those on the menu, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for late dinner Fish and Chips were good, Salmon was good, Shrimp Scampi good, and Shrimp special good. Place decor was old low lighting ambiance. What was a surprise was the HOUSE Zinfandel and Chardonnay by the glass was $15.00 each. unacceptable for a HOUSE wine. a 1/4 glass of wine cost more than one of our meals which were all under $14.00 we visited Friday March 16th we got the new waiter trainee he did great.  3.5 stars due to the wine cost"}
{"text":"The Village Pub is a great place if you're as cheap as me. I like it: depressing decor (vinyl booths, ESPN sports center playing in the background and no one under sixty in the place at 12 noon for lunch). It's basically your standard Las Vegas dumpy, dark Las Vegas lounge, but they do have good food.  I've been there for lunch and dinner. Do yourself a favor and go there for lunch for the VP Burger lunch special. It's like $5.49 with thick steak fries and a pickle.You can't eat at McDonald's for that price. It's a great price for what you get. The burger is super juicy and delicious.  If you ask for medium rare, they'll actually make it medium rare (which is not common for this city). The fries are okay, but at that price, who cares?  Going there every week, I would stay away from the Texas Style Chili. It's basically a can of Alpo they dumped in a bowl. A friend ordered it. Honestly, it looked like they boiled ground beef and then put it in a bowl. Out of instinct, I was compelled to set his bowl on the floor and whistle for my Irish Setter that died in 1991.  Nevertheless, everything else I've had has been great  though. The burger is fantastic! The meatball sliders are incredible and the cream of chicken soup (only served on Mondays) is my favorite. Really, the food can be insanely good.   I really like the Village Pub and I'll keep going there. Great price and okay variety. I really the place."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie.... seriously,  it's the best! Followed by the shrimp casaer salad.... omg...Bartenders are entertaining and attentive. Because of them... I hang out here way more than I should... Iain!! Pullman!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so underrated ! They have delicious food for the cheapest prices ! Everything from their fish & chips to their omelettes are delicious ! The only thing that could improve is the customer service... But for the money, it's the best for a variety of everything"}
{"text":"If you want to cut the shit and have a great, cheap meal this is the place. Kelly is my favorite server, she greets us with a hug every time we come in (we go there a lot) and lets us know how she is. Most servers truthfully can't stand their regulars, but she's actually genuine.   It's dimly lit and quiet and OFF THE STRIP. Every time I pick somebody up at McCarren I take them to Village. Sick of noise and douchey Vegas types? I know my guests will be in a matter of hours after checking into their hotel, so I do them a favor. I first take the to a place where they can relax, and hear the people around them. Tough to find in this town.   I always get the apple pecan salad - it comes with two really big slices of garlic bread so I don't feel all \"healthy\". (My parents come to visit from Chicago and have a fit when I order a salad, like I'm all \"healthy\" and \"not eating\")  Onion rings are the best skip the sweet potato tots for those instead, california burger, awesome. Meatloaf special on Wednesdays is spectacular. Oh! And the chicken penne. Get it with extra cheese.   The Flamingo location is my favorite because of Kelly. It's worth the risk of walking through that parking lot at 1a.m. Whenever I go to the sunset location I feel like I\"m bothering the people that work there because I want to order, and their always either under staffed or the staff is fighting. Awkward. But I love this place and the food is the same at all of the locations. Hope this helped."}
{"text":"If you want a no frill cheap happy hour place to eat in the Henderson area, look no further. If you don't mind the eternal cigarette smoke and oily food, you found he right spot. Conveniently nestled near the suburbs of Henderson, this Village Pub location will give you a sense of home and family unlike the other locations. The cook will actually bring out your order personally and is very nice, even if you make him go back to the kitchen to fetch a side of ranch after you ordered. Jackpots are usually updated daily and since it's a Village Pub chain, you can see and take part of the daily gaming and specials from other locations."}
{"text":"It's very dark in this restaurant, I'm guessing that's so the patrons can't see the slop they are consuming... If you stick with the traditional fried bar food, you'll probably do alright; but if you order anything more complex good luck with that... I will say that the prices here are amazingly cheap; that is unless you consider the cost of your dignity when you tell people that you chose to eat here."}
{"text":"need to find a chef that can cook a hot meal. cold food served!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! service sucks"}

{"text":"Good local pub, excellent prices"}
{"text":"Ellis island feel.. Very friendly.. Large portion for the price...  mmm yumm Tasty! Nice and quiet in the dining room.. Plenty of space.. K Server- Brendan very knowledgable on company info.. Great personality..  - kid friendly"}
{"text":"Stayed at a nearby hotel and needed a no-fuss meal. Googled it and it seemed good. Saw that the fish and chips are their best seller and gave it a shot. Pretty good, especially considering their $9.95 price. Batter is nicely flavored, cod is fresh-tasting, steak fries have a nice flavor to them--not a coating, but perhaps a light seasoning. Tartar sauce tastes homemade. Paired with an EI Hefeweizen--@ $4/pint, this was a great sub $20 meal. Went back the next day for a déjà-vu experience: same seat, waiter--who remembered my drink, and ordered the same dish. Heard there was a New England clam chowder special and ordered a cup. Wish I ordered a bowl. It was delicious.   My only gripe is that this is a smoking bar, but this is what it's like in Vegas, so I accepted that when I walked in."}
{"text":"Casual american pub. Came on Friday a night and it was busy. I ordered the spaghetti and it was pretty good for a pub. Kudos to the quick and friendly servers."}
{"text":"I love the microbrews and the food the only down side is the silly ass music and when they are very busy no enough people working."}
{"text":"Ok so I waited at the sign that read \"Please Wait To Be Seated.\" So I waited and waited, it was a good 10 min. before someone came out to greet me. If they were busy I would understand, but I was the only one there!! So that out of the way. The food is not bad and reasonably priced. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that the initial problem was a one off and won't happen again. So I will give it another chance. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"A great local place. Ok so its a bit dark, but the prices cannot be beat $12.99 for a rack of ribs. They also have one hell of a happy hour! 1/2 price drinks that are already cheap as the dickens and half price appetizers. Give this place a try instead of fast food. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try them out on Thanksgiving for an extra meal.. 2.00 charge for a To-Go order because it's a special..:(.. I guess this will be the only time I have food from here then ... The staff was friendly especially since they had to work on Thanksgiving.. But the company has lousy  policies.."}

{"text":"if you want to loose all of your local business keep doing what your doing, bad decisions for one size prime rib, deleting the number one salad dressing in  the u.s ( honey mustard), the dropping  use of tea spoons, using little straws for coffee??, and using water glasses to serve wine in the dining room, and  cutting back on chicken dishes,any more changes and think we will GONE !!!  r. carson  sun city summerlin"}
{"text":"Thought we would try coming for lunch and again, very inattentive staff, good quality was so so. This was the final nail in the coffin. We will be completely be avoiding this location from now on"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas visiting family and we met a few of them at the Village Pub for dinner on our last night.  We had a group of six and were seated at a large round table right in the middle of the restaurant side because we had kids with us.  They have a full bar and a selection of Ellis Island beers (I guess they own this location along with their other casino).  Our drink order did take longer than what I was expecting since there were so few diners that night, but the beers were tasty so that was easily overlooked.  We tried their Light Beer and their Stout beer and they were both delicious and we ordered more of them later on.  We placed our order and everything came out quickly and correctly from the kitchen for all six of us.   I ordered the Bleu Burger which came with bleu cheese, bacon and sauteed mushrooms on a ciabatta roll (YUM).  The sweet potato tots are delicious and are more dessert like than sweet potato fry like.  They were tossed in a cinnamon sugar mix.  I didn't try the gravy, but everyone else that had it said it was delicious and they would order it again.  The wait staff was courteous and attentive without checking on us too much.  If you're looking for good bar food away from the craziness of the strip, this is a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips, spicy fingers and burgers.  Great, attentive service.  We eat there often.    Warning:  The fried chicken is the worst I've ever eaten.  Over cooked, dry and coated in a dry sand-like substance.  I should have sent it back."}
{"text":"Wings anyone?  Yum yum. Got very WELL DONE the way I asked for them with extra ranch then a killer burger.  All was hot and properly prepared. The staff and bartender were hella cool. Not a lot of peeps but gaming was hitting for me. I made serious wins. Ok family,  I will buy you more than a card for Christmas."}
{"text":"The bartenders are really friendly and the cesser salad was really good. They add extras like tomato, onion and avacado. The happy hour special was $2.00 a drink.  Seriously,  for a little local gaming pub near home, it is a nice little find."}
{"text":"Village pubs are a branch off of Ellis Island casino, which is great! If your in the mood for cheap drinks and tasty food it's a great bar to visit!   The fish n chips is awesome! It is not overly breaded so you get the good taste of the fish and the steak fries are some of the best I've had in Vegas!   Really cool that they carry local beers as well, all of the ellis Island brews and the home made egg nog are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here July 17 around midnight. This bar was absolutely wonderful, my guy is big into bars and we were looking for a new place to try. This popped up on my yelp search, and what a joy it was to eat here. The waitress was great! She had such a welcoming personality, which it seems here in Vegas you don't find too often anymore, but she really gave us an inviting presence. I asked about food and she explained that the kitchen cooks up a storm and I explained my dietary concerns and she came up with the best recommendations and we ordered from there. The food was great, came out in a timely manner, and we were super pleased with everything we received. Thanks again guys, we will surely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite and/or a brew. They are affiliated with Ellis Island Brewery so you can get the EIB beers without the hassle of going there. The Hefe and Stout are very good. They have an dynamite special on ribs (12.99 full rack) they are meaty and tasty. Fish and chips is very good as well. We have always gotten friendly and consistent service. You can also take home a growler for about $13."}
{"text":"We were invited by one of our neighbors, thought, sure...will give it a shot. Village Pub is affiliated with Ellis Island...translation...you can get a pint of El Weiss (Hefe brewed at Ellis Island Brewery) without driving down to Koval. Service was prompt and friendly. Had the Fish & Chips, huge portions. Easy to get to, corner of Eastern and Wigwam, and easy parking. We noticed they have a decent Happy Hour 1-3 & 11-3 M-F where you can get EIB Drafts for $2.50, plus app promos. I like the EIB beers but dislike having to go down to Ellis Island. Winner all around."}
{"text":"Yesterday I gave my Mom four places to go for my Birthday. I have had fantastic Ribs, Steak and Fish and Chips here. However, last night March 5, it took fifteen minutes for our waitress (JANELL) to arrive after we had receive our drink order. The fish was over cooked and I attempted to eat it. But hid it under my napkin. My Mother's was overcooked as well. I realize this is not the American or Marche Bacchus as Jeff and Rhonda pride themselves in Service and Food. However, even prior to putting in our order (JANELL) went around showing photos on her cell phone to people. Needless to say my Birthday Dinner was a BUST!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 3 years and after some management shuffling over the last year, it's good to see things back to normal. The bartenders at this location are, and have always been wonderful!  Becky, Passion, Danny, Kali and Connie. They are always friendly, the service is great, and the camaraderie amongst the staff is a huge draw for not just me, but so many of the numerous regulars who frequent this bar. There is a cohesiveness and an ease amongst the staff and the customers that makes this the kind of place you want to spend time at.  But ask anybody who comes here regularly and they will tell you that the glue that holds this place together is the bar manager, Robert. His personality and leadership were greatly missed during his brief absence and its great to have him back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner after an amazing ugly sweater party, which my wife won! gj babe! It was around 12:30am, and the place was CRAZY decorated for Christmas! It looked AWESOME inside! We were greeted by \"Rory\" the bartender, who was excellent. He was very knowledgeable about everything they offered for happy hour and their regular menu.  $2 Happy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm & 11pm-3am on Ellis Island draft beers, Wine, and Cocktails with many delicious alcohols to choose from. Also 1/2 off appetizers! The food was cheap and hit the spot!  My wife got the classic burger, which she said was in her TOP 5 burgers at any bar shes been to.  I ordered the \"Pub Chicken\" which was chicken sauteed in lemon accompanied by rice and sauteed veggies. It was a bit over acidic, but good, especially for a bar.   This bar could absolutely be my wifes and I's new local pub. Good service, good food, and good Ellis Island beers on tap. Great end to our fantastic night."}
{"text":"We've been coming to dine here for years, the food is great and the service is fantastic! Marlon is our server and he makes us feel so welcomed!

This is our go-to local restaurant."}

{"text":"Village Pub is a great place with excellent service!  We live right down the street, yet always manage to 'forget' this location and wind up going somewhere else.  Then, after horrible service at other locations we end up back here.    We were visiting just this past Monday with Michael the bartender and his service is excellent!  We never ran low on our drinks, managed to have great conversation as the music wasn't too loud, and there were no loud-mouth drunken fools like most of the other pubs around.    We have yet to eat in the dining area, yet everyone I speak to says the food is excellent with good pricing.    Thanks Village Pub, and Michael in particular!

{"text":"I tried posting the other day.  My family eats there often and raves about it.  My experience was far from 'raving.'  Perhaps 'raging' would be more appropriate. 1.  Waitress was busy chatting with a customer for a long time before even acknowledging our table of 7. 2.  Finally get her attention, place our orders and it took a while to get our salads.  When she got there with the salads, she realized she forgot the croutons.  We were about finished with salads when the croutons arrived. 3.  40 minutes later we are still waiting for dinner!!!   Finally, after 45 minutes and one or another of us reminding her we were still waiting, our dinners arrived. 4.  My dinner of grilled chicken and portabella mushrooms was dried out and tasted like the packages of frozen chicken you can buy at Costco - with that gross aftertaste of preservatives.  I took one bite and sent it back. 5.  My nephew ordered the steak.  Adequate until he pulled a hair from the plate.   6.  Several minutes have elapsed and I am still waiting for the waitress to return to the table to see what else I want to order in place of my gross chicken/mushroom leather plate....  by the time I got her attention, whoever was actually consuming anything at my table had actually finished.  So, I declined to order. 7.  The restaurant Manager was not there, so the bar manager (at the request of our server)  took off a few items.  He should have taken off the entire meal. I can promise that I will NEVER eat there again.  I went back in to be sure he understood that he really should have taken off the entire, mostly inedible..and those of us who did eat, did so reluctantly.  My family said this was the first bad meal they had there.  I am from out of town, so I guarantee when I am visiting my family again next time, this is not where I want to eat. The bar manager should have done much better for us, and the kitchen help ... don't get me started on them. My review:  DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy eating here and have for many years. I realize some days are better than others and consistency is not always a hallmark at a lot of resturants. But I just had the worst meal of all time here tonight and the clueless cooks have the Gaul to argue about the quality of the slop they served tonight makes this the last time for me. I ordered fish and chips and a side of cream of broccol soup. The soup or paste was room temperature and unedible, and the fish was dark brown as in they haven't changed their fry oil for days.... Fries were also dark brown. The breading was mush in side and not cooked through just a soggy greasy mess. I wasn't the only table complaining as there was two other tables that also had the same dish with the same result. I felt sorry for the waitress , but these cooks need to find work elsewhere, your serving undercooked fish to people for God sakes...its brown because the oil is so old it gives the appeaance that its cooked in till you cut it opened and see the uncooked battered mess..should be ashamed to let a plate like that leave the kitchen. And after several complaints dump the fryer and clean it ....shameful"}
{"text":"It looks like the Village Pub is becoming the new go-to place for our standing Friday night dinner with two other couples.    It was busy, and we had to wait for a table, but it turned out to be just a few minutes.  Our waitress, Linda, was very attentive and accommodating.  All six of us were happy with our orders:  skewered shrimp (change the rice pilaf to mashed?  No problem!), orange roughy, top sirloin (with salad or soup, veggies, rice for 8.99 - such a bargain!), teriyaki chicken, chicken fried chicken, and wild Alaska coho salmon.    Good food at yesterday's prices.  Reasonably-priced drink menu. Comfortable booths.  Great, friendly service.  Gaming and ashtrays at the huge bar.  What more could anyone want?  Of course we'll be back.  Maybeeven  next Friday night."}
{"text":"Renee, Chris, Penny, Noah, Crystal & John are some of the best bartenders ever! They remember your name and better yet your drink. Oh and the food servers Marlon and Chris are always on top of getting your food to you, they always have a smile on their face. However the food manager keeps taking items off the menu don't be surprised if your favorite dish is gone. Go else were for food but come here for a cocktail."}
{"text":"I ordered the southwest skillet, and after taking a couple bites I couldn't eat anymore. It was extremely spicy hot, not edible. I had tears running down my face. The response by the waitress was god awful, she didn't even take the skillet off are bill. I'll never go there again!"}
{"text":"I think a lot of locals come here since it was pretty crowded even though it's located about 6 miles away from the Strip.  We came here for breakfast (my friend's aunt lives nearby), which is cheaper and better than any place I can think of in S. CA.  One person ordered the ham, which was bigger than the size of my face.  I had the corned beef hash ($5.50).  Even though I think it came from the can, it was fried into two yummy patties.  Another two ordered the chicken fried steak, which was also pretty big ($6.99).  All the dishes came with toast, eggs, and cottage fries, which are basically fried circles of potato.  All in all, it was a hearty and good breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  If you are looking for a restaurant with great service or family setting, avoid, not that service was bad, it was great for a bar.  But it is a bar and people smoke,  and go to drink and play video poker. We went in because we were craving a beer and some fish and chips and they did not let down.we had onion rings that were above average,  and the fish and chips were awesome. they literally had just made a fresh batch of beer batter so maybe that's why, but they were great. 3 big pieces of fish,  plenty of fries. good tarter sauce. And they were meaty, cooked well, had a nice crunch but not dry and not greasy.  I would totally come back for a drink and some good bar food."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I always get the salmon. Grilled. Plain. Served with rice pilaf and veggies, plus soup or salad.  It's delish.   The red interior is loungy and comfortable. They have picture of sailboats on all walls. Service is fast and friendly. House wine is decent and very reasonably priced at$3.50 a glass. You can also order a half carafe of wine but I don't remember how much. It is a little more than 2 glasses from what I recall (maybe $7.50 or $8?)   Boyfriend got the chef salad which was HUGE (see pic). He said it was very tasty - he ate the whole thing so it must have been. :)  Nice variety for the dinner menu. Not a ton of veggie options though unless you like salad or cheese quesadillas.   Overall always a great experience and you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"No Veterans appreciation here today....SAD.  The food was ok as always, the service was just alright nothing special.  I had to get my own extra napkins and grab some jelly from the other table.  I watched James our server go around several times asking people if they want more coffer, I was drinking hot tea and asked twice for more hot water and never got it.  Not sure why it's so hot and miss, and people just don't like to do their jobs but it is why it is.  I'm sure we will come back as this is an ok place from time to time, it's just the service and the lack of caring from the employees.  I even put the pot at the end of the table with the lid up and no one ever asked once.  Don't appreciate Veterans and lack of service today earned this rating...."}
{"text":"Have the fish and chips. It's perfect. And also they brew their own beer and root beer. I don't drink but I hear it's great. I can vouch for the root beer. It's awesome ! Go check em out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Update!!! We went and took up the manager on her offer for a free meal on mother's day in the morning. We were treated great. The food was great and we will be back. Thanks for taking care of us like that. We are glad we have a place to go so close to the house. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local eat.  Table was ready on request. Our waiters name was Samantha she was a delightful waitress. It's well worth your money you can get a whole rack of ribs for $12.99 after 4pm. The sirloin was juicy and shrimp were on point. I look forward to coming back soon. Thanks for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Reasonable prices! Best fish and chips I have ever had! Fish was huge and fresh. Boyfriend had the rib special and for only $12.99 it was well worst that."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for years. A chill spot where I like to stop before a movie across the street.  The food is a terrific, the price is right and when I cannot make it down to their parent store, Ellis Island, I can sneak in here and get a micro brew from their own batch.  Best deal in town on some terrific beers.  This store seems to be larger compared to some of their other restaurants.  If you like to gamble they have a significant amount of machines compared to other bars I have stopped at in the area.  Hope this helps.  Oh, the daily specials, wonderful."}
{"text":"Favorite- Fish & Chips $9.99 Three pieces with a heaping amount of steak fries!  Add a house salad for $2.25 which is nice with croutons, iceberg lettuce, red cabbage and cherry tomatoes.  The waitress Myrna was prompt and friendly- nothing better than a seasoned waitress to take good care of you.   Unfortunately, have to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant- a bit smoky for this nonsmoker."}
{"text":"We had fish and chips and a grilled chicken sandwich. Both were very good.   They had an awesome Amber Ale on tap. Good steak fries.  Probably the best food in the Jet Blue wing/area of the Las Vegas airport."}
{"text":"Village at Desert Shores is always super yummy! Cant go wrong with a single menu item. On fridays there is clam chowder to die for. Fish and chips a favorite too- although like I said hard to go wrong. It is open 24/7 and the gaming seems to be good for most people. Service is friendly. Ellis Island owns it so Ellis Island brew on tap Plenty of TV's . Overall a good spot for late night craving. Used to have happy hour, but currently took that away and only has football specials. Hopefully that changes up after season."}
{"text":"Super cute decor inside and they have a menu that has many options. Would definitely recommend their happy hour! They have $2 drafts and there soup and salad is $6.99 for full portions!"}
{"text":"I truly have mixed feelings about this bar. It's super smoky, the decor is very outdated and the food it's just ok. Most of the people that come here are big time gamblers from the ages of 45 to infinity! This is definitely a very laid back bar, not much action happens here. One of the few food items that I liked the most were the baked penne pasta and the fish and chips. Other than that there are not that many good dishes. Most of the food items and drinks are very cheap which is probably why so many people come here. But I still wonder why so many people come???..I guess it's probably the same reason why my bf keeps making me come here, cause it reminds him of the bars from his small town! .. Either way, the bar is waaay too smoky and I will try not to come here as often! :)"}
{"text":"John and Rachel are wonderful here. Food is delicious and service is excellent. Prices are great also. Jamie is also very good as well. Brandon is great too"}
{"text":"IT TAKES A VILLAGE      It takes a Village to bring good food and fun times with decent prices to the people. Throughout the Las Vegas Valley , when it comes to good food and fun times at decent prices, and a down to earth bar to enjoy an Ellis Island beer, the Village Pub has the people covered.     Ever since I moved to the Las Vegas area in 2004, I have been a fan of the Village Pub. It was in the last year that I really spent time in a Village Pub at the Desert Shores location before and after walking along the ethereal shores of Lake Jacqueline. I predict a review for this location in the near future. The thing is that Desert Shores is around twenty miles from my place. The Eastern Avenue at Wigwam Lane Village Pub is convenient to my work and home. During the past three late Saturday afternoons I spent time here after work. Each of the three times spent here, I  intentionally ordered a different entree. This review is a report of my three experiences here in the month of January, 2015.   January 17:     As soon as I walked inside, I set eyes on a chalkboard menu displaying the outstanding daily specials. Recently on a Friday in the Desert Shores Village, I ordered the $8.99 fried shrimp special and truly relished every bite. Once I looked at the regular menu, there was no need for the Saturday $13.99 rib special.     Once you walk inside this Village, you feel like you are dining in England. This is a divided Village with a smoky bar separated from a smoke free restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is dark red with walls adorned with paintings and tvs. In its unique way minus windows it is a Village in a world of its own.     I ordered the Greek Penne Pasta ($9.99). It included soup or salad. I ordered the cup of the cream of broccoli soup. On all three soups, cream of broccoli was the soup. The Greek Penne Pasta with the chicken and penne pasta was decent. But the coffee needs improvement.   January 24:     The speed of service is not their strong point. Their were some long gaps in service. Especially from finishing the meal to the check. But in the Village, people are not rushed.      I ordered the Chicken Francise ($10 .99). Instead of the soup I ordered the house salad. The Chicken Francise was a good choice. On the plate was a sufficient portion of a chicken cutlet sautéed in lemon, white wine, butter, and garlic, over rice pilaf and veggies. It was both delicious and filling making my taste buds feel like a Baron of the Village. I was looking forward to my next experience here.     After the diner, I hung out in the bar. I enjoyed an Ellis Island lite draft while playing Keno. What I don't like about the bar is that they discourage you from paying when you get the beer. This isn't the most persistent service which results in a wait from when you want to hit the road to when you can pay. Overall Jamie is a good bartender.   January 31:      Today I opted for the fish & chips ($9.99 and soup or salad $1.99 extra). I had overheard the servers telling the customers that the fish & chips are their favorite. The menu boasts that it is simply the best for over forty years. Their three large fish &  chips are Icelandic cod dipped in a beer batter sauce made from Ellis Island beer. As I delved into their fish and chips I enjoyed the taste of the Icelandic cod dipped in tarts sauce between bites of steak fries and sips of Coke. But it wasn't the best. How could it be? When I chow down on fish & chips, cole slaw is the food companion of choice. I strongly think that Cole slaw would of improved the fish &  chips dinner. In my opinion hitherto now, Miller's Ale House serves the best fish & chips.     After the dinner, I hung out in the bar. It was a similar experience to the 17th.  The Village is in my future:     There are dinner entrees that I am looking forward to enjoying at a Village Pub in the future. They include the pasta mariana with meatballs, chicken parmesan, and a burger. What I anticipate happening is that I will be enjoying them in a different Village Pub regardless that I am a fan of this location. Preferably this location will be along the ethereal shores of Lake Jacqueline and or another Village that I will become acquainted with."}
{"text":"I now see why these older people spend all their money gambling at this establishment because the food is solid and the service is five stars. My sisters and I came here a few times for brunch and a little gambling, the bartenders we're all friendly and kind throughout our experience. They even comped our food without being asked because of the money we spent gambling. I would definitely come back here and hope that Shantel or Sally would be our bartender. Way to go Village Pub!"}
{"text":"This Village Pub is one of the nicest of this small Las-Vegas based chain of pubs.  Both ordered easy over eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon and wheat toast.  This restaurant is a few steps up the food chain from Ellis Island which it shares common ownership."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much from a strip mall restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My burger was excellent, and service was great.  Don't let the exterior or decor fool you!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby of a place!   Quiet & calm which was nice, considering most bars are too cray to enjoy on NFL Sundays.   Good food every time I've been (4-5 times).   Had the eggs Florentine this morning, aside some breakfast potatos- very tasty; everyone enjoyed their food.  Bartender was a little behind & disengaged but nothing I couldn't handle..she made a decent bloody.  I enjoy this hidden little spot for it's qaulity food & relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Only reason they got one star was the coffe was good. My son and I got there and seated at 6:00 . First I asked the busboy for an ice water with as much ice as you can get in the glass and no lemon, sure enough he sets in front of me a water glass with maybe 5 cubes of ice and of course lemon, while waiting for new water I noticed four new tables got seated. Finally, a new water came , no fruit and of course again five cubes of ice ( either there's an ice shortage here in Vegas or they lost the recipe to make more) . Now I notice those four new tables have just received their appetizers, it's now 6:30 and still nobody has taken our order, told my son if I finish my coffee and nobody takes our order we are leaving... Sure enough, coffee cup empty as well as our booth... last visit to the Village Flub for us!!!!!"}
{"text":"So yummy and great service! Breakfast served till 2pm plus we can walk here from our home... So awesome."}
{"text":"We used to go to Village Pub once a week because the fish and chips taste just like they do in New England and the shrimp scampi is fantastic. However, if you don't have an hour and a half to spare...it's not the place for you. It's almost comical how terrible the service is. The older waitress stands next to the table like you're annoying and doesn't say a word. She stares at you with her notepad in silence. The busser curses under his breath and is super mad if you need a refill. We've made it a game to see how rude the wait staff can be and laugh at the horrible attitudes but it's not really worth it anymore. The food is great but I can find good food other places where my presence is not a bother."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken pot pies I have had in Vegas! It is worth the trip here to just get this item. The serving was large, and the cream sauce inside was amazing. I could taste a hint of sherry in the sauce which takes it to another level. They also have plenty of video poker machines and Ellis Island beers on tap. It is a bit smokey in here, but still worth it for the pot pie."}
{"text":"Would not recommend anyone go here. The manager \"Annetta\" is a complete and utter cow. Rude, pushy, and when asked for a way to contact her superiors over her attitude, she became extremely belligerent. I had to actually contact another location to find out how to get in touch with \"Annetta\"'s boss.   The woman pitched a fit on myself and my fiance for disagreeing with her opinion that the smoking ban is a horrible thing that will crush all restaurant business in Nevada. She informed me that I've OBVIOUSLY never worked in the industry (which is false) and that I had no right to say that eating in a pub/restaurant is better without people blowing cigarette smoke all over, and that it's \"People like you who cause 3500 servers a month to lose their job in Las Vegas.\".   She also allows her regular customers to flaunt the ban and smoke anyway.  When asking if they had any drink specials, the waitress (not Annetta) was very kind and polite, however after I ordered a drink, Annetta had to pipe up \"You ask about specials and all you order is a F*&$ing Heineken? Jesus!\"   Unfortunately nothing was done about this woman last I checked. Steer clear of the place and that wretched woman's attitude."}
{"text":"We work at a dealership in the automall and always order breakfast from the pub, there is always a sweet woman that answers the phone BUT today however this wasn't the case CONNIE was working and I am sad to say this will be the LAST time we order from this bar.. When calling in our order the woman on the phone was very unpleasant, I told her we had 4 different orders and she replied with \"all on different tabs!?\" I said yes, she responded with \"yea ok let me see how to do this\". The last order was just sourdough toast and she complained \"ON ONE TAB?!\" I said yes, or you can just add it to the first order. She took my order and we hung up.. THEN we had to call back and add another order and she was just as unpleasant to the person that called, responding with \"next time can't you guys just call in ONE order on ONE tab, it's easier for the cook? In response he said, \"what if you had 5 different customers come in?\" Her response was \"I'm just saying it's easier for the cook!\" This is HORRIBLE customer service and this woman needs to realize how she is coming off to people by saying things like that. Obviously  she doesn't want our business or ANY business for that matter. If you get CONCEPCION on the phone or as a waitress hang up or walk out."}
{"text":"I am upset and dissapointed with the The Village Pub in Summerlin! I've been coming to The Pub for years with friends and family. I just found out they fired our favorite waitress Arlene! To the management at The Pub: Have you lost your mind? Arlene was The Best waitress you had! She has waited on my friends and I many, many times and always had a nice smile and friendly attitude! She NEVER, not once, EVER, got our order wrong! She was AWESOME! WOW! It sounds like a boycott is in order here!"}
{"text":"The place was not busy for a Saturday night. Food was delicious and the service was great. Will definitely return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Portions are still great, but the service is getting a bit less excellent. The tables are dirty. The FLOOR HAD CHICKEN BONES that I stepped on while exiting the booth...... nobody near us during our visit had chicken. The service today was kind of slow. Maybe they were short staffed, I'm not sure. All in all I feel that my experience was nowhere near the level excellence that my past experiences were."}
{"text":"I like this place! I am not a fan of the smokers puffing away (ok, this IS Vegas not SF so I got over it but it still sucks lol) but the service is great and the food is = to the service. I love their club sandwhich and the drinks are stiff. If you want to go out for a casual meal or a few drinks this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Just wanna give a huge shoutout to Susan! She's an efficient, extremely friendly and personable bartender who knows her way around a bar and how to treat patrons and make them feel welcome. Wow! A couple of cold ones on a warm fall Sunday afternoon was what I needed and she just made my day. A true asset to the establishment. I'll be back.."}
{"text":"I Love there Hot Wings! There cheese Burgers are Bomb on a Hard chapati bread! Oh Yea!"}
{"text":"Me: \" We want steak, wussup?! Where the spot for locals??\" Friend that moved LV: \"Oh I know a spot.with a nice view of the lake too... I'll take you guys!\"  15 minute drive, and I see Lake Mead (which I assume is Lake Mead, cus we drove down Lake Mead Street).  Looked pretty suburbs, but the trusty navi said \"Please drive 600 feet, you destination will be on the right hand side\"  First assumptions:  1. ghetto 2. umm ghetto pub 3. errr ghetto pub with video poker?!? 4. o hells to the no... ghetto pub with video poker and smoky as hell??  After getting over the initial shock of the \"nice restaurant with a lake view\", we were seated in a large booth (which I will admit was pretty comfy).  FYI: there was no such LAKE view at this place... we got played..  Yes, this place is a bit tacky diner red... but then I saw Prime Rib for $12.99.. and I was suddenly OK...  Since my other friend were ordering the Prime Rib, I decided to get something different.  The South West Burger caught my eye: Angus burger, guac, jalapeno, pesto, pepperjack, and some other saucy thing I can't recall on a ciabatta. SOLD. Medium rare please!   When my burger came out, it was HUGE, and quite adorable wrapped in waxed paper made to look like newspaper. But whatever, I'm about the taste.  Took a HUGE bite of this bad boy, OMY was it good!!! I don't if it was cus I was SUPER hungry, or this burger was SUPER yummy! The meat was perfectly cooked at med rare (which most burger joint always OVERcook).    Juices were flowing, gauc all over my fingers, cheese on my face, and in 10 minutes ( I swear), it was gone.  I even made my friend try it, so I didn't feel crazy.  She thought it was pretty darn juicy and yummy too.  This was by far the BEST JUICY BURGER I had this year!! And for $6.99, shoooooot you can't go wrong!  O yea.. the prime rib was OK... but I sure was glad to have ordered my burger =)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing as well as the bar staff. Araceli is an amazing bartender. I reccommend this property if you just want to relax and enjoy some good people and food."}
{"text":"We loved the Village Pub!  My boyfriend and I were staying at La Quinta, on a Saturday night. We had a wedding to be at, early evening, so we chose to have an even earlier dinner. This place was not only close, but had nice reviews. Under normal weather conditions, it was walkeable, but in the Vegas heat, constant AC is a must!  We entered the shooping center and the restaurant is large and easy to spot. Once inside, you'll see a chalkboard to the left, with advertised specials. You can dine in the formal-looking, restaurant section, or enter another set of glass doors/wall partitions, for the bar area. We weren't about romance for tonight, so we opted for the social bar experience.  I'm not a smoker and second-hand smoke can get to me, but luckily we found a spot and most of that was done on the opposite side. The bar is large, oval. The opposite side had table gaming and ours did not. I liked that option.  Kevin was the bartender and was so awesome. His adorable TN accent and personality, helped make our dining time, that much better. He explained about their own brews and presented us with menus for food and drink. I easily ordered a glass of Moscato, since it's not usually served in many restaurants. My guy got the EI Light. It was smooth and quenched his thirst enough, for him to order another.  I was blessed to put an order in, for Prime Rib. Quite frankly, it was the best I've ever had! The creamy horseradish, was also amazing. My baked potato side was good, with butter, sour cream, and chives. I didn't try the vegetables, but they looked good. It also came with a fresh salad, yummy croutons and Ranch.  Robert ordered the half rack ribs. They were juicy, fell off the bone, and came with a great BBQ sauce. He wasn't crazy about the coleslaw and did choose to add salt and pepper to the underseasoned potato salad.  Still, our time there was superb. The food, service, big screen tvs, and even the mixed genre of music from the speakers, was pleasing.  We will also come back here."}
{"text":"Great food for not just \"pub food\" but an actual restaurant! They have specials daily I have yet to try but they must be delicious because they definitely draw a crowd. I always get a salad to start because their ranch dressing is my favorite! I've tried the chicken pot pie and it is to die for. Very simple yet super delicious chicken and vegetable filling and the puff pastry on top is light and crispy. Yum! I've also tried the minestrone soup that is very hearty and delicious. I would definitely order it again.  I also love their steak fries especially dipped in ranch :) I'm sure I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great little joint...  I had the chicken Panini and was very impressed with taste and freshness.  My friends had burgers, steak and one had a salad.  Everything looked great.  I will be back for sure, so far my favorite local joint."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The drinks are cheap and the food is cheap but the quality of the food is amazing. Not to mention the amazing service and hilarious bartender Chris. He's my favorite. Gaming is a plus. Chris thank you for the entertainment always."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great Service! What more can you ask for? Visiting my mom in Vegas I have gone twice. The first time I had Fish and Chips which was delicious (they are known for their fish and chips), they made a pretty good Cosmo as well. Second time I went I had a burger delicious! Pricing is great on food and drinks as well. If your ever in Vegas and need a little break head off the strip for Village Pub I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food great service great prices everyday they have a daily special be sure to ask about it always something great also are server chris was great ...thanks"}
{"text":"My mom recommended this place. I drove all the way down from the east side to try this location. Immediately was not disappointed. The staff was very welcoming, attentive, and polite. Prices are very good, and welcoming. I had a flight and the 5 beers on it were above and beyond expectations. Then moved onto a cup of clam chowder and then the fish and chips. Food was A+++. Really recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We go here all the time.  Came in today and sat in the dining room for 15 minutes and never even saw a waiter."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone & picked up. Person who took our order was very nice.   When we went & picked up, the 2 people at the bar were both helpful & got our food right away. We ordered Steak&Fried Shrimp and an Apple&Pecan Salad. Both tasted great. Only problem was that when we got home, I noticed the vinegarette  for my salad was forgotten, so I made my own.   We would definitely go back. Friendly people. Good food. Not expensive."}
{"text":"This bar is a block from my house and I always go there. It's not usually that crowded and the drinks aren't too expensive. Bartenders are nice and food is decent. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The server was very friendly and receptive. It is a great local hangout. If you want to just eat, you can go in the dining room ( to avoid the smoke). The bartenders are also very friendly and offer prompt service."}
{"text":"My go to place for Steak & Eggs. - $7.50 morning special (I think later in the day it's $10, still a bargain). - Excellent happy hour that's $2.50 for well drink or draft beer. - Great bartenders and staff. - I go here 2+ times a month."}
{"text":"Probably should give the Village Pub a five instead of a four star! I have been going there for well over a decade. It has a very good basic menu. I was in the mood for breakfast. My \"basted eggs\" were cooked perfectly! It is a great local Las Vegas establishment!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. We go here when we want comfort food. They serve generous portions. I usually can only eat half of my meal and take home leftovers. The breakfast is really good. I love their breakfast potatoes! The chicken pot pie is delicious! I have never had a bad meal here. They have daily specials that are a great deal!"}
{"text":"My earlier review of Village Pub was much more favorable.  Now that I have been back a few times, I have downgraded my rating a bit.  The main reason for this is the service.  I went there tonight and waited for fifteen minutes for someone to come around and take my order.  I eventually gave up.  That also happened one other time when I went to Village Pub for dinner.  I like the food, but it doesn't matter if I can't even get someone to take my order!"}
{"text":"Try to order to go food and even pay over the phone. Sorry have to come. Ok I am coming with a baby. Get here and now hour wait for food kitchen backed up. Are you kidding me. Bartender had no customer servise or friendliness. Was just tough luck."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie was decent--too much heavy cream for my taste, but not bad for a restaurant and for the price. The hostess stand was vacant when I got there and it took a long time to get seated--especially since they weren't busy. I nearly gave this a 1 star for what I witnessed though. A slender lady with a bun on top of her head (couldn't catch her name) was running food from the kitchen with a sucker in her mouth! She couldn't stop playing with it while she was handing out the plates. That's a heath department violation. Servers cannot touch their hair, nose, face, beard, mouth, cigarette etc. without washing their hands before handing food, food-prep areas, or anything that goes to a customer. Please re-educate your staff! Not sure if I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's our family's staple of the best place to eat and bring family and friends from out of town. The food is excellent and staff is friendly from the dining room to the bar area. My 2 favorite bartenders Larry and Jamie make us feel like this is our second home. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in Vegas, Food has never disappointed , service is friendly , portions are big, we love this local joint!!"}
{"text":"Low Prices  Big Portions  Good Service  GREAT FOOD!!   We never leave Vegas with out stopping at any of the Village Pubs.   They are all Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. The chicken parmesan is killer, the steak fries are great. The salads are great too. We never disliked anything here. The fish and chips are good. Every day there is a special, they got the meatloaf and it was huge. And it was about 7.99 or something in that range. The pot pie is good, The menu is just good meat and potatoes American fare type of food with some fried items, burgers, salads, and some Italian.  There is also a nice cheap breakfast here too.  A great casual place where you can sit and talk for a bit. Generous portions for the prices, also offer smaller lunch items too. And you can eat for under 10.00. The gambling is all sectioned off to one side so it does not interfere with the dining experience.  We never had any issues with service here either. Pretty good considering how bad service can be in even the fancy places in this city.  If you are looking for a hip trendy place this is not for you. If you like big paintings of old ships and dark red walls and corned beef and cabbage then you'll love it. :)   The seating is mostly size friendly. The bathrooms are clean at least when I go. :) parking is easy. This place isn't for everyone, but the more laid back & possibly the more mature crowd should like it."}
{"text":"Went here before hitting a movie. Just wanted a decent priced burger and this seemed like an OK spot.  First off the layout is very odd. You walk in and there's a huge square bar with video poker that takes up most of the space. Off to one side are a few cafe tables then a seperate room with more tables. The seperate room was full so we sat out at the tables by the bar which was kind of smokey and cold by the door.  Server was nice. I ordered a medium burger. It came out pretty rare and meat had little flavor. Between atmosphere and average food I won't return."}
{"text":"I asked the front desk manager at the Hampton Inn if there were any good restaurants near by. Travis recommended The Village Pub just a short walk around the corner. OK. The Village Pub is in an old strip center. It is so totally non descript from the street that I nearly walked right by it. It is an old, creepy red leather,  red carpet pub divided in to two sections, the smoking, drinking section and the non smoking restaurant section. I sat in the restaurant section. I asked my server what their signature dish was and without hesitation he said the fish and chips. That is what I ordered along with a glass of merlot. I know, I know you are supposed to drink white wine with fish. I was in a creepy old Las Vegas Pub so I took liberties and ordered red. The fish and chips were delicious and I am not kidding! The size of the serving was crazy big. The clientele was interesting. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at the Village Pub. If I stay at this particular Hampton Inn again, I will come back to the Village Pub for the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Danny is the man! We like to head there after work and he always gives us a great experience. It's the best customer service I've had at any bar. The food is good too, but the drink specials are great."}
{"text":"All you can eat for 21.95 at lunch and 26.95 for dinner. That includes the full menu. You can easily order $100 worth of excellent sushi tempura, special rolls, hot dishes like tempura soft shell crabs (delicious). The fish is very fresh and of extremely high quality. The price is right and the sushi is delicious."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.. Service super slow... The wait staff just stands around while patrons are staring at them trying to get their attention. The only reason i keep coming.... Cuz they have descent prices. Will i come back...... Sure for take out only..."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and delicious here. Very fresh good quality. The first time we came here everything was great the service was good my only complaint is that when we came here near closing the male server had an extremely!bad attitude. He gave us an attitude like hurry up I want to go home very rude very nonprofessional. His attitude was so bad that if the food wasn't as great as it is. I would never come to this place again. I wish I knew his name. Anyhow, I will just go back at different hours hoping not to see his cry face..."}
{"text":"I first heard of village pub threw my coworker. He would go here all the time  and told me good things about this place. I have been here about four times exactly. On September 1,2017 I decided to order carry out, and spoke to John. John took my order I asked for well-done steak and shrimp with garlic mashed potatoes. The price was great $14.60 for my meal! Come on you're not gonna get anything better than that. Oh my God the fried shrimp was amazing tasty and delicious  even garlic mash were tasty. Now I was disappointed in my steak ?!! It was so overcook that when I tried to bite into steak I couldn't even enjoy it!  On September 2, 2017 around 11 AM I called in and spoke to Susan who apparently was the manager at that time. I told her how happy I was and how disappointed I was about my Steak. She took my name and number and told me she or manager would get back to me. I was a bit confused because, she just told me she was the manager! Anyhow I didn't get a call back just yet."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great service, yummy food, open 24hours. The chipotle bbq tenders were delicious! And the cesar salad was huge, and had large veggies and avocado, yum! Also, great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. When it's busy the hostess moves like a snail. Empty tables just sit there for over ten minutes before she seats you. Might not go back. Good food doesn't save bad service."}
{"text":"Great food great prices. Friendly staff. Can't beat the food. Big portions. Can t wait to go back. I will make it a once a week spot"}
{"text":"My favorite local bar near me! Food is great, drinks are cheap, and service is fantastic!   I live closer to PTs and copper keg but I always go here instead!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and was very disappointed! I sat down and ordered a chef salad. After sitting there for 30 minutes and watching everybody who came way after me getting their food already, I was upset. Since the waitress never came back to the table, I had to ask someone else to check on my salad which should take only 10 minutes to make! Then I was told it was on its way out in about 5 minutes, Really?! So you forgot to make it and now I have to go back to work because my break is over. No one ever came over to apologize. Horrible customer service and I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Clean venue and they serve the absolute BEST fish n chips I have ever eaten in my life..it's their signature dish..."}
{"text":"I have been here 2x once for breakfast (stk and eggs. $2.50 mimosas) stk was ok not great. Just went in for happy hour had a few drinks and decided to eat ordered the Yanky burger! One of the best burgers I have had.  This is a gem of a place! Everyone who works there is really nice and super helpful! So glad I live in the neighborhood. Next time I need a burger fix. I am heading back"}
{"text":"Came here during football and they have the best specials during that time, $2.50 draft beers and a football time special menu that had 3 sliders and fries for only $4, 5 wings for $2, chili cheese fries for $3, so we ordered one of each and wooooooooooooo that was alot of food, for the price I was expecting sliders the size of white castle sliders but no no no these were more like burgers not sliders and had a good amount of fries, totally worth double what we paid, looks like I found my new sunday night football spot, also bar tenders were fast and polite"}
{"text":"Good service, reasonable prices, generous portions, and quality food keep me coming back. I had the steak and eggs special and the steak was perfectly cooked again. My son's skillet breakfast was huge! The service here is attentive and we were done with our full meal in less than 40 min. Great place!"}
{"text":"For the price and location and amazing food. I love this place. Better yet after 11pm every drink is $2 and half off appetizers. Now, lets start off with the salads. They make their dressings from scratch and I especially love the italian dressing. It's almost addicting haha. Anyways I usually get the chicken pot pie and my gosh it is HUGE and only $8. It is actually pretty decent but I finally found my favorite biscuits and gravy. Best biscuits and gravy EVER. Ya it's a bar but you know what they serve some good food and especially a glass of $2  PROS: Price, chicken pot pie, italian dressing, serivce CONS: Smokey atmosphere"}

{"text":"Food is always delicious!! Great service and low prices! My parents love this place so much they go almost every weekend lol. They have $2 mimosas and bloody Mary's and they're not stingy with the alcohol if you're looking for a little buzz! :))"}
{"text":"great place to eat... low key and nothing upscale, but it serves the best bar food.    i normally get the VP chicken caesar salad.. so good. comes with grilled chicken, avocado, tomatoes, olives, and great toasted french bread.  its a really great chicken caesar.... it has so much flavor and the grilled chicken is plentiful and moist.  i've tried the fish and chips as well as the fried chicken, both done really well."}
{"text":"We have Been going here for about a year and loved the food but things have changed the last 2 months.  Food has changed And menu has changed. Pub shrimp are gone, chicken Parmesan had Swiss cheese on it! The pasta with it was some kind of flat noodle and there was little sauce. My fave ribs were awful, not the same at all and came with no sauce on them. Also hard to get drink refills here. Have retried several times  but not the same. Am going to miss going here but enough is enough"}
{"text":"If  I could give this place -stars I would. The service was horrible. The only decent server in the place is Oliver. Waiting in line to be seated 10mins. Finally seated our shelves since waitress and manager were talking, and \"bus person\" they use to seat people and get drinks is clueless.  People that came in right after us were seated and offer drinks? We still have not been helped at this point. When they finally get a clue after being waived down they waitress comes by. She asked if we had been helped. I explained we had been waiting, not acknowledged, so we sat ourselves. She apologized and asked to get drinks.   My kids felt bad seeing other people being helped and seated, seconds after walking in and wanted to leave. So we did. We went to Wincheles down to the Street in the Smiths shopping center. Food there is a bit more pricey but service is  100 times better. We were seated and offered drinks upon walking in. It was like night and day.  Due to lack of service I would not recommend this Village Pub location unless they get new staff including the manager. We since than we have been to the Village Pub by The Valley Auto Mall. The location by The Valley Auto Mall is much cleaner, and service is much better. It is worth the extra 10 min Drive not to have deal with bad service.  I would not recommend the location by Eastern."}
{"text":"This is a local chain w/ locations all over the valley. Only major drawback is the fact they are considered a casino, therefore smoking is allowed. You need to fight your way thru the bar area to get to the restaurant, therefore your drenched w/ smoke coming/going. The food  and service is generally good. Price/quality is phenominal.Where can you get a good steak/salad/portato for 6.99 all the time. Menu is vast, you will definitely find something to your liking. Service is good, many of them have been doing it for years, they know their trade!! Give any of these restaturants a try you won't be disappointed....."}
{"text":"Village pub is great. Their menu is basically American and Italian with some old english fish and chips thrown in the mix. They really do have the best fish and chips in town. They have daily lunch specials with great prices. I have never had a bad meal here. The other reviewer who gave a bad review to Anetta may have took things too personal. She is always happy and nice to everyone. She doesn't take any crap from idiots though so if you can dish it out be prepared to take it. She has never been mean to me and most of the regulars come there just for her."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for fish and chips but didn't want to drive far. I saw some comments on Yelp on how good they were here. So what the hell...10 minutes later fish and chips with an added side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was dry, no dressing:( so I made my own with mayo and sugar. The fries were good. The fish was goog but not traditional...the beer batter had lots of seasoning which made the coating taste more like KFC. The fish was tasty and was cooked well. Nothing was greasy. It just didn't wow me or satisfy the need for fish and chips. Oh well...you live and you learn. My waitress was very friendly, which made things a bit better."}
{"text":"The Fish and Chips were really good and the clam chowder was really good too.   The service is pretty marginal but we would go back because the food was good!"}
{"text":"Love the Village Pub and especially Oliver!  On my recent visit had the Apple Pecan salad with salmon. The apples were crisp, the pecans plentiful and the salmon was very tasty!  Definitely recommend and if you can be seated at Oliver's table the experience will be very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for some king cut prime rib. Prices have gone up a few dollars, use to be a few dollars cheaper and comes with a free drink. If you are craving for some prime rib at under $20, this is the place to go. I've tried the Fettuccine Alfredo twice and I can still say it is very bland and needs a bit of salt and cheese.  Burgers and the chicken options you cannot go wrong. I recommend the 50/50 burger, 50% ground angus + 50% ground bacon. Bacon you can never go wrong.  If you are ordering the fish & chips, make sure to ask them to put the fish in another basket, or else the fries will come out under the fish soaked in oil.  The Chocolate-Brownie-Thing is sub par and hiding under a load of whip cream. With all that said, I still will go here for a decent prime rib and some good local micro brewed beers."}
{"text":"Omg! All I have to say is Chicken Fried Steak! Best I have ever had! Ever! It is actually made with a yummy pork tenderloin as opposed to the usual grisly chewy yucky piece of pounded out meat. Served with garlic mash and veggies. Atmosphere is nice too as it is not clubby, lots of great televisions and super nice staff. Our bartender Roly was really fun and friendly as well. He also suggested our amazing apple cobbler dessert. Yum!!! Also kinda cool that they are the same owners as Ellis Island. That means same fantastic beer and even root beer!"}
{"text":"Well, about 10 minutes after our arrival we finally got our server.   I feel the bartender was far to interested in her patrons at the bar to be bothered with even mentioning our server would be with us shortly and if we even wanted a menu. This, Lori (bartender) seems to lack the full spectrum of customer service.  We received our server who was pleasant and did apologize for the wait.   We ordered the Fish n' Chips and each got ice tea.   The ice tea, was amazing. Fresh, not too strong nor was it week. Very refreshing.   The fish and chips, while yes they were not light and golden as they should be, they did not taste like old over used oil. The fish itself was light, flaky and beautiful in color no fishy odder but did have a slight fishy taste. I thought it was me but my lunch partner also noticed. The chips are nice country cut potatoes fresh out of the fryer and were as tasty as to be expected from French fries.   Outside of the wait to be addressed and the slight off taste of the Fish not a bad experience per se. I Will although continue to visit the Sunset location."}
{"text":"Lori makes the best bloody Mary's and my husband keeps going back for more.  Everything is great here.  Good food, good atmosphere, and close to my place.  Don't really go out as much as I used to but this place is very low key and the cooks know what they are doing.  I like the fact that it is an older crowd and ordering food to,go is not that big of a hassle.  Everyday there is a a special and on Thursdays it's the best because they can take the corned beef and make you a Reuben.  Good breakfast specials as well and you can either sit at the bar or one of their comfy booths.  It's so good in fact that almost every time I walk in there is either a small crowd or cops on their lunch break enjoying a sandwich.  All in all, great food, good beer, and Lori's bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"This is my local home bar and grill.  The Staff is fantastic, food is very reasonable and good (in most cases), drinks are fair priced.    Croud is like the weather in Las Vegas; wait an hour it will change.  Most cases great group of locals folks."}
{"text":"5 starts for 5 star service from the best bartender out there! Shout out to Lori for always rockin it! She's the only reason I come. And the good food. Stacy is the best cook here."}
{"text":"We got into Las Vegas about 9pm and needed to eat. We were staying at the Hampton Inn and the hotel driver suggested this place as an easy option to get a decent dinner. The restaurant side was closed for the night, but the bar area stays open 24 hours and always serves food. I must say, the food was better than expected from a smoky bar. It did the job and a refreshing beer helped. We could have ordered pizza to our hotel room, but this as a better option. I'd go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I was very pleased overall with my first Village Pub experience.    In waiting for a movie to start, we hit up the pub for a drink and a light meal.  The staff was incredibly accommodating.  We asked about having a snakebite, and while they weren't familiar with the drink (and also not having any cider), they gave us a small beer sampler to try so that we could find a nice substitute.  Seriously, who does that?  Service was just all around very nice and helpful.  In ordering food, I got the chicken wings.  Service was prompt, and they were really good, no, actually great chicken wings.  Probably some of the better ones that I've had in a good while.  They also have a lot of specials, which I would like to try sometime in the future.  Prices were reasonable, for a smoking bar, the effect was pretty unobtrusive, and the decor was very British with its paintings and wood paneling.  The bar just had a good vibe overall, which was complimented by the tasty food and friendly service.  When hitting up the movie theater in the area again, I will definitely stop in for a before or after movie cocktail after this first impression.  I like nice people, good food and beer, and reasonable prices.  Check, check, and check.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good food at great prices with friendly service. Open 24 hours. Check out specials on board at entrance"}
{"text":"I live Walking distance from this place and have driven by on my way to and from work everyday and there always seemed to be lots or cars in the parking lot. So i kept telling myself i would go check it out. So last night we decided to go out to dinner and a drink and I figured what better way to do it than going to the village pub.   As soon as you walk in there is a restaurant type dining area to the right and the bar seating to your left. We walked in at about 6:50 and happy hour apparently ends at 7:00 but the bar tender gave us all happy hour prices on our drinks which is $2 beer and $2 well drinks as well as $2 off all appetizers, which is a sweet deal when the most expensive app is like $6. We tried the stuffed potato wedges which are delicious, my wife ordered the Fish and Chips and I ordered the Pub burger...  As for the fish and chips..... \" WOW\"  absolutely amazing. Definitely not the type of fish and chips you expect in the middle of the desert.  The Burger was also Very Very good, cooked exactly how I asked and it was very tasty.  This is now a go to place, we had 2 drinks an appetizer and 2 meals for $26 and won $25 on the keno machine at the bar so in all reality we payed $1 for an amazing meal.  Oh and i almost forgot, they have a 24 hour full menu... SO if you are thinking about getting some food late The neighbor Roberto's is not the only choice.."}
{"text":"Fazit: underrated Pub & Restaurant   Außerhalb der Vegas Strip Location, direkt am Airport gelegener Pub mit guter US Küche.  Direkt an der Hauptstraße gelegen ist dieser 24x7h operierende Pub. Da unser Motel La Quinta in fussläufiger 3min Nähe liegt, sind wir bereits vor 2Jahren beim letzten Stay hier aufmerksam geworden.  Natürlich ist es beim eintreten etwas.....\"einfach\" gehalten. Die Location hat zwei Bereiche: eine Bar (smoking allowed) und hinter Glas getrennt gehalten und einen einfachen Restaurant Bereich.  Um es kurz zu machen:  Steaks, Burgers, Salads, Fish & Chips (Special des Ladens) uvm und nie teurer als 9-13$! Das rockt! Und schmeckt wirklich gut! Freundliches Personal und eine wirklich gute Auswahl an Beer und härteren Sachen  Alles in allem ist der \"Shabby\" Look hier kein Zeichen der gelieferten Qualität- wenn ich in der Nähe bin komme ich wieder"}
{"text":"This place is seriously so AWESOME...this is my husband and my \"go to\" for late night eats...all the BOMB appetizers are 1/2 off and super yummy..the staff is the best part too always so friendly and nice and hold good conversation...this place has been a fav of mine since I was young just good ol bar food...not to mention my elderly grandparents come here almost daily just for their yummy soup! Thank you for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"We always get good service here. I don't remember her name but we usually have the blonde waitress and even when its busy she keeps it handled.   Mom and I usually get the steak special but I haven't had anything bad here.  I have tried the chicken fingers, potato skins, breakfasts and brownie dessert. Everything has been a win so far! The prices are good and I never leave hungry.   This is one of my preferred bars to munch at. :)"}
{"text":"So this is the second Village Pub location we have been to besides the one on Bermuda, and it was really crowded with people this time, who all seemed to be enjoying their food.  I am pretty impressed at Village Pub in general, as the food, while not the beacon of culinary awesomeness, is delicious for what it is, just simple coffee shop/cafe type food.  The type you get from the 24 hour restaurant at any casino.    However, what sets them apart is that they take restaurant.com certificates at pretty much every location.  My husband had the teriyaki steak special with grilled pineapple and fries, and I had a simple chicken caesar salad (they put avocado in theirs, yummy).  Everything was dirt cheap, fresh and delicious.  On top of it, we each had two of Ellis Island's Hefeweizen beers.  All of this food and beer with the certificate and tip only cost us a whopping $16 bucks.  A complete steal, honestly, and the service has been so consistently good, we have been tipping over the 18% they automatically add to the bill because we use the restaurant.com certificates."}
{"text":"We had a restaurant.com certificate and tried this place because it wasn't too far from home.  Didn't know until later there was an even closer location on Eastern.  We had no idea until we sat down that whoever owns Ellis Island, seems to own the Village Pub chain as well.  The food was fairly similar, except without the 6.99 steak special of course.  They do have their own specials such as ribs, fish and chips, etc.  The best part was they served the wonderful Ellis Island Beer, for just 3 bucks.  While not as cheap as getting it from Ellis Island, it was a hell of a lot closer to drive to.  Not to mention, it was a lot colder.  We came here on a seriously hot day, and I ordered the Hefeweisen with lemon.  Not only was the beer severely cold, but the glasses were too.  It really hit the spot on such a humid day.  For food, we tried the hot wings, which were big, and very hot and crispy.  They served them fresh out of the fryer.  Not the best tasting I have ever had but prepared very well.  I had the fish and chips platter.  Again, not the best I have had compared to fish and chips in Seattle, but for Vegas they were delicious.  The fries could have been better but for the cheap 8.99 price, I honestly didn't care.  My husband got the chicken parmesan pannini.  This sandwich had one of the biggest, thickest chicken breast I have ever seen served in a restaurant.  Very heavy but delicious.    We ended up having lots of leftovers, and the waitress was so cool that she gave me fresh tartar sauce and lemon to go with my fish to go, and malt vinegar.  She was so good that we ended up tipping her over the 18% the restaurants usually add for usually a restaurant.com certificate.  This meal only cost us $18 for the two of us, which included beer with the certificate, making it an incredible bargain.  While not a beacon of gastronomy, for the price it was pretty damn incredible and deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice quiet atmosphere. Great place to chill and have a beer and wings. If you go, don't forget to order the giant pretzel it's really good."}
{"text":"We recently bought a house nearby and had heard about this pub from neighbors, so we were really looking forward to discovering a good neighborhood place.  A number of people have left positive reviews which I am sure are truthful reflections of their experiences.  Unfortunately, we drew the short straw.  After having dinner here, my husband and I were both violently sick all night.  The only thing we both ate was the fried fish, so I assume that was the culprit.  One other reviewer mentioned feeling that the seafood (in her case, shrimp) was not the freshest, and she was wise enough not to eat it.  Since ours was the batter-fried Fish 'n Chips variety, we didn't see the fish until we bit through the crust, which was very thick so all we really tasted was the fried batter.  After our experience with food poisoning, we will not be going back, but I gave them 2 stars because the staff could not have been friendlier or more attentive, the dining area is clean and comfortable,, and the prices are reasonable.  I am not saying that you shouldn't try it, just that you should be careful about what you order.  Although I had some of my husband's fish dish (and did not get as sick as he did), my entree was beef and it was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"Walked in with my gf to grab some dinner, then noticed this place allows smoking in the restraunt area and the staff...well I have no idea because I didn't see any behind the bar or walking around, so I guess they were sitting down with customers or something.  Walked right back out after that."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, good prices and good food. I have eaten here for over 10 years and really like it."}
{"text":"After today I will never be back. When you order food it's either takes one minute or a half an hour to arrive. Today it took over half an hour and the food still never arrived. Lots of takeout orders. It's funny because when I call and ask for takeout they tell me that I have to come in and order. Aldo over the years it has been inconsistent and, the Friday shrimp special is something that I look forward to for lunch. I'm now looking for another place for lunch on Friday's ......any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Came in to try a new local place since my move  to the south west.  Very quite on a Saturday night, but relaxing in the restaurant.   We ordered a house club sandwich and a French dip sandwich.   The food was fresh and delicious.  Seasoned steaks frys had a good taste   Found out that the restaurant is owned by Ellis island, so I had to ask for a taste of the root beer  The root beer is fabulous   The server Floridia was very personal and made sure our first experience was rememberable.    2nd visit Ordered the steak because I was not aware the pot roast was only on Tuesday.  I Tuesday visit will be for coming :) Steak medium well with green beans and garlic mashed was fabulous  Cooked to the exact temp that it should be To add to the taste I grabbed a root-bear which added to the experience   The server, Marlon, was exceptional.  He told me about all the daily specials and treated me like  I was a regular with out knowing me"}
{"text":"Best place by far to have a beer and or a great meal. Rena is the best always attentive and nice to talk to . Try the ribs or fish and chips"}
{"text":"Like the pubs and their specials. They are hidden gems in Las Vegas. Went in on Sunday morning. Wanted to watch football in the bar. Ordered breakfast. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. Portion was big. Price was very fair. Service good. This is a good place."}
{"text":"Place is clean and friendly. At times there is a longer wait due to place being packed, other times, its not so bad. There is variety on menu and lots of food specials. The food and service are good. Recommend fish and chips."}
{"text":"This is our \"local\". We come in at all different times of day and night. Sometimes lunch or dinner in the dining room, however, mostly we visit the bar for gaming, drinks, and food. Food is good, drinks are good. This has been our go-to place for years, until recently. Last month they discontinued their happy hour! The happy hour was half off appetizers and drink deals.  It was a limited menu, but it was our late night spot. We would come in late at night and the bartender was always fantastic! She made a great cosmopolitan! There are so many deals in this town, so we will come back here when the happy hour returns. Please bring it back!"}
{"text":"This has fast become a family favorite during our visits to vegas. This is a small place with great atmosphere, friendly and fun staff and WOW fantastic food. I almost dont want to tell anyone...could have been a great secret."}
{"text":"I went pt's pub first. I played video poker for $1.25 per hand for over an hour. After losing $100, I changed my betting amount to 50 cents per hand. When I changed my betting amount to below $1 per hand, they started charging me for my beers. On top of that, they didn't have a kitchen to order food and they suggested I order from the pizza place next door. I settled up my tab and left.   I decided to go Village Pub instead. This was a winner. The food was terrific, the machines were fair (I broke even) but most importantly, the service was exceptional. I need to mention my bartenders Lori and Kelly were terrific. Both of them were extremely friendly and attentive.   I'm in town for march madness with a bunch of friends and I plan on taking the fellas to village pub for a few drinks.   If you ever have to choose between pt's or village pub, go with village pub. They remind me of the old vegas. They take care of the customer and offer fair comps without nickel and diming you to death."}
{"text":"You can really never go wrong here, We have always been great fans of the food here. Cheap and good,. what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"We have not been to the Village Pub in years since we used to have a friend that worked in the kitchen and I must say the service is top notch and the food is as good and cheap as it was.  We tried Village Pub two days in a row as were had to be in the area both mornings. Both meals were great and right at $20 for the 3 of us.  OF course Ignacio loves his breakfast so both mornings he stuck with a straight forward eggs & meat.  Uriel on the first day had a Fantastic meatball sliders that came with 3 sliders and those fantastic steak fries.  I had a club sandwich that was loaded with meats a lot of bacon and the fixin's and again those great steak fries - hard to find those anymore.  On the 2nd days both guys had breakfast with a couple huge pancakes with eggs and meat.  I had one of the best BLT sandwiches I had had in a long time.  Again, they did not skimp on the bacon here.  The first day we were served by Taylor, a very nice waitress and the second day by The bartender - Evan, who was on the ball from the moment we walked in.  We look forward to making this a regular stop again as it has been a long time."}
{"text":"Not sure where to go, the wife and I ended up at Village Pub. I have had good lunch experiences at other Village Pub locations, so we figured it was a safe bet for a decent dinner.  We didn't have to sit long before someone came by to take our drink order, a few moments later, the server stopped by and asked if we had any questions.   So far, so good.  I ordered a chicken Parmesan Pannini, the wife, a chicken pasta dish.  Our food came out pretty quick and looked like it would be good. Her chicken was charred so bad, it was almost pure black, and was dry & tough from being overcooked. The pasta and sauce were good though. The included bread had an odd flavor.  My pannini bread also had a strange, plastic-y flavor to it, which ruined the rest of the sandwich, as it seemed like it tasted good.  If you are going in for easy, fried bar food, or apparently, anything without bread, I am sure you may not be disappointed. Not sure if we will give this place another shot or not."}
{"text":"The service is spotty, it smells like an ashtray even though the dining room is non smoking and the decor is way outdated. That being said, they offer cheap food and beer (brewed by Ellis Island!) and for that I am a fan.  We have been for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most recently I was craving steak and since we're on a budget, this was our first stop. They have a daily special for a 10 ounce sirloin with veggies and potato for $11.99. Hard to beat that! The steak was cooked medium rare as ordered, the veggies were delicious and there was a ton of rice pilaf with my order. It definitely filled me up.  I ordered the Ellis Island IPA, which ended up only being $2.50 because it was happy hour. My hubby ordered the sampler, and received large tasters of 6 different beers, which was a pretty good deal. He also ordered the fish and chips and they were amazing!! It was a large serving and perfectly breaded.  As I mentioned at the start, the service is spotty - it is usually very slow, even though I rarely see the restaurant crowded."}
{"text":"I would like to thank our fabulous bartender whose name rhymes with Bristina... for being an incompetent, unfriendly, and arrogant bartender. Village pub usually has good service but I appreciate the amazing treatment we received. I didn't know we were at Dick's...on purpose. Get em girl! If she's not there 3.8 stars, her there -.8."}
{"text":"Stopped into the local bar for drinks and angie was bartending. She was so friendly and professional. She also makes a killer vodka soda! Will definitely be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Was driving around looking for a breakfast place. Stopped in due to being a pub. Was surprised at the layout and menu. Food was really good and the place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because I just love it... Cute cozy neighborhood spot with great specials for great prices.. Every night is a different special you just have to call and ask! The fish and chips here are my favorite and also their steak special is so good! A good fix of food in a cozy booth and I'm a happy girl ;)"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm a native Las Vegan, and have never stepped foot in a Village Pub all these years! My mom and godmother go out to eat with their husbands quite often, and this Village Pub location is a favorite of theirs. I always found this interesting, because they are all very picky, and I figured pub/bar style food wouldn't be their thing.   My mom decided she wanted to go here for Mother's Day breakfast this morning. An odd choice I thought, and I wasn't sure if I could bring my daughter in, but she reassured me I could, and I was up for trying it out.  I was pleasantly surprised the moment we walked in the door. There is a cozy restaurant completely separate from the bar, and I LOVE the decor!!! It brought me right back to Old Vegas, which I love so much! It honestly looked more upscale than I was expecting.  It came time to look at the menu, and I was pleasantly surprised at the breakfast options, as well as the prices! You really get your money's worth here, and the food is great! Our waiter was wonderful too... such a warm and pleasant man... I wish I would have gotten his name.  I'm so glad my mom suggested we come here today... I predict we will all be back many times!"}
{"text":"Leslie, the bartender who works Friday nights, is the worst bartender in Las Vegas. She is unfriendly and does not pay attention to the customers.  I like to gamble and am always completely ignored.  My date was so mad last Friday night that he said we would never go back. She did not acknowledge our presence when we sat down and when we left.  There are a lot of bars in town so good customer service is a must.  And it's to bad because the food is fantastic and the waitress in the restaurant  extremely attentive.  Four stars for the food section."}
{"text":"This isn't a fancy nightclub or high end restaurant. This is good old-fashioned simple food, in a clean environment. I went in to watch the SNF game (after I left Sierra Gold because the service sucked there). Rachel the bartender was friendly, smiled often, and took good care of me. The bar wasn't crowded, just a few old folks gambling (its weird when I'm the youngest in a place haha).   They have a rotating special for each day of the week, and lots of other stuff going on. I might have to come back for Pork Chop night. I think I saw for NYE a steak and lobster for $29.99 dinner. They are affiliated with other Village Pubs around the city. I think this was my first time eating at one.  I had a French Dip sandwich. The meat was a touch too salty for me, but it was tasty. The bread was super soft and soaked up the Au Jus nicely. Priced right at $8.69 including sweet potato tots. There were a few other selections on the menu that I will try. Its very basic food, American style, but done right.  I'll be back because I like friendly service, unlike what I received at Sierra Gold."}
{"text":"The food wasn't hot but not cold probably in the temperature danger zone there were only a couple of tables open but only 2 servers so of course food wont come out hot and drinks will not be kept refilled management should do better... good staffing will ensure better customer service and a higher chance that food doesn't set in the window to long and lose its good temperature."}
{"text":"Great spot for a few quick drinks- the food isn't half bad for being your standard bar fare- I recommend a Guinness- they have it in the can with the widget so it's nice and fresh!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I have a great time! The food is actually really good- they even have healthy options! Not your typical Bar food. The drinks are strong and the bartenders are friendly but not too chatty. There are plenty of seats to gamble/or not - your choice- they aren't pushy about it like some bars. The bar is really really smoky though- very chill spot most people are here to just chill and watch a game on tv with a beer"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 with Ribs available every day? What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Vegas has the advantage of giving us Two Worlds. One is the world of the Tourist Elite; The finest hotels, clubs, amenities, entertainment and dining are all here for them... and we can enjoy some of them on occasion to \"splurge\". The other world is our  world; The \"Locals\" World. Casinos with better deals and smaller lines. A room for $30 when you don't feel like driving home. Fremont Street when the Circus isn't in town. Bars and clubs with 1/2 off specials and table/bottle service that doesn't cost a car payment.  And a 24 hr bar/ fine enough dining venue for a 24 hr person. That place/s is the Village Pub. Their Steak and Daily specials are not to be outdone in price or quality. The room gives you a \"Classic Vegas\" feel with big red booths, wood trim and a service that makes you feel like you ARE the Big Wheel in the room.  The sports bar is sealed off so no smoke to affect you. They have locations all over town so there's always one nearby. And the prices? The way I eat (BIG)... you can sit , eat well and enjoy for what you would be paying at McDonald's. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Poker room is typical smokey and super smelly but the food is great (usually) and so are the bartenders. I would have given the pub a 5 star rating but due to the fact that I found the menus on their website along with their phone number they would take a pick up order over the phone. Seem pointless when the phone number is on the menu and the bar/ restaurant was not busy when I went in. When I got home my chicken fingers were kinda of burnt and very dry a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Yum mmmm Yum!  Yearly tradition, must have the corned beef and cabbage dinner! As this time of year comes around, my body starts talking to me and LOUD! My mouth starts to water, drool, salivate like crazy thinking of that succulent tender and juicy corned beef! Now I have on several occasions bought a corned beef brisket and cooked in my slow cooker, although delicious as well, is not the same as going out and enjoying it at Village Pub.  Village Pub always rocks all year no matter what you order, but corned beef and cabbage time is just the best and their busiest day of the year. I have always eaten at the location on Fort Apache, this year decided to try the south rainbow restaurant which is just as fabulous!  I like that the smoking section in the bar is enclosed with glass so that when you are eating it is completely smoke free!  The food and service is always outstanding! Prices are more than reasonable for the generous portions you get! I wish I knew the Owner of this joint, I would so give him, her or both a nice big juicy kiss for having such an awesome Pub!  Mmmm yum I am still savoring the tender and melt in your mouth corned beef brisket, it is moan worthy! The meal was ridiculous big, a nice hearty portion which was incredible and left me stuffed to the brim! The complete corned beef and cabbage dinner came with your choice of soup or salad. I ordered a salad w/ranch. Mmmm oh sock it to me they have the best ranch on earth! I want to drink it from a cup it is sooooo good! I want to take a bath in it and lick it off of my body it is that good!  Mmmm check out Village pub, St. Patty's day or not their food and service can't be touched!  Marlon was an awesome waiter, spoiled us with sweet service!  Mmmm suck me silly this visit was Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here for an after-work get together with the whole office and we all left to go to another bar because of the attitude from the bartenders here. One seemed like she was annoyed every time we asked for anything and the other was trying to cut perfectly sober people after 2-3 drinks. The food was plainly average, the happy hour drinks were a good price, but more than glad we left, will surely not be returning. Had much more fun elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow. Most of the reviews said great food and service . Tonight we got a bartender that had a hard time poring stout. A servicer that drowned the salad in Italian dressing and didn't bring drinks for 20 mins. But the steak and buffalo wraps were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is not a gaming bar. It's more of a waiting room or a stall while you wait for a Chimichanga from Roberto's."}
{"text":"I've come a couple times with my family & they're generally good with time, there was once where they only had one cook but for the most part I won't return to Denny's if I don't need too and ihop has really never been my favorite. They are very good price wise & the food taste amazing. I've brought my family to eat and they loved it as well. Near where I live currently, and I recommend this place to absolutely anyone."}
{"text":"well, i went back with a friend today for steak and eggs. i was this time pleasantly surprised when the manager, davin, came over to our table and apologized profusely for the previous mishap. i assured him that i would not discount the excellent service received in past for the shortcomings of one poor employee. when our check came, there was no check - just a note saying \"we love you & appreciate you! thanks for returning.\" now that gives you a little glow, right? that genuine expression more than rectifies. i am pleased to correct my evaluation to be representative   of the entirety of the staff, not just one bad actor. selah."}
{"text":"A little mysterious, yet slightly appealing is how I'd describe this place. The outdated decor adds nothing to the ambiance, but the solid food quality is their saving grace. The restaurant was busy during my first visit, and the bar was pretty full too. One reason to come here is the Ellis Island brews, available on draft and served very cold. The Irish Red was surprisingly refreshing!   It's a poker bar and will probably be smoky. The Pubs are known for their food, and I had a delicious meal, the pork francese. It was a bargain for  $11. The pork was flavorful and tender, and the accompanying rice and veggies were very good too. The meal comes with soup or salad, and the salad was an average, run of the mill iceberg but was pretty big. I also had the rib tips basket, and again it was excellent. Tasty BBQ paired with fries and cole slaw, and a good sized portion. The Pub's location within Desert Shores is kinda hidden, which is an advantage I think. The one thing it's missing (other than not being non-smoking) is a lakeside view.  Parking at the center is easy, and I recommend coming here for a meal if you enjoy great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I believe this is the second Village Pub I've been to. Looked a lot like the first! The decor in the dining room and also somewhat in the bar is weirdly nautical, with lots of what appear to be oil paintings of ships. There are also wine themed metal sculptures on the walls in the bar which I think clash with the nautical theme. The red booths & chairs/bar stools are kinda cool, kinda retro. The bar is very open with a high ceiling, which is different from most poker bars I've been to. The joint has a vibe that's like stepping back a few decades to simpler times before most bars tried to become the newest, trendiest incarnation of a bar. If it's low key & unpretentious you're seeking, ye shall find it here.   Here's the take away from my visit- the beer is COLD! The coldest draft I've had in a long time. They serve Ellis Island brewed beer at all Village Pubs, and I really liked the winter seasonal. The bar wasn't very busy during my visit, and I believe most people were gaming while sitting at the bar. The menu is worth checking out and they have a steak special similar to Ellis Island's famous steak special."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it was the day before Thanksgiving, but having 2 people on staff, which seemed like they were the cooks as well is unacceptable. First it took us 5 minutes to get seated. The dining room is no bigger than 2 large bedrooms put together and there were only 5 tables occupied. Finally someone showed up and sat us down......10 minutes later we are asked for beverages......10 minutes later they arrive. Let me remind you that everyone as either waiting or eat and their were only 5 table occupied!!!! I was out with my bf's family and we sat soooo long waiting to place our order, my bf had to get up, walk back into the staff area and ask someone for ice cream or something sweet and quick because his father was going into a dangerous level of hypoglycemia. The delivery of the ice cream was the fastest service received that night. After seriously an hour, we received our food. In the mean time a couple sat down, wait, waited, waited, and go up and left. If the food wasn't good, I would have sprouted horns and become the customer from HELL!! Lucky for them the food was satisfying enough to sooth my rage. When asked for refills, they never removed our old cups and soon all the multiple cups of 5 adults crowded our table. The food was good and cheap, but the service was MUY MAL and I will never eat here again. Crappy service is worse than crappy food and to top it off, they weren't even apologetic about their horrendous service speed."}
{"text":"The bartenders are always super nice and friendly. The food is good. I like this place and recommend the hefenwizen with lemon!"}
{"text":"Better than average food for a bar.  Good prices, especially for their specials (some of 'em not advertised).  Steak and Eggs breakfast is specially priced before 11am on weekdays and before 2pm on weekends, but their coffee sucks... really bad.  Orange Roughy is great.  They also serve the best fried chicken in LV, however I'm not sure they sell it anymore.  Service is haphazard... which isn't a bad thing.  The same waiter that serves you probably won't be the same person that brings it to your table.  It's more like a team than an individual server."}
{"text":"April, the waitress, is FANTASTIC!!  She runs her tail off.  Management on the other hand needs to get more people to get the food and drinks out faster!!"}
{"text":"The full slab of babyback ribs with sides served at Ellis Island for $12.99 is the best deal in town. Total hidden gem in Vegas. I am just not a fan of the parking situation there, or the long wait (unless you get there before they open). And they brew their own beer and have a really good boot beer too.  But if you have kids and dining on a budget, you can't bring them to eat there. Them are the rules. No exceptions. You can order it to go. No need to get upset at me, I just work here. Some tourists are jerks (not the words used in my head, still tryna keep it family friendly). You can try Metro Pizza, they are pretty cheap too. Kinda.  Wait a sec. This IS a review for \"Village Pub & Poker\".   Why is this fool telling me about Ellis Island Casino and their BBQ? What an idiot. Not Useful at all! Funny wise guy wasting my time is totally not Cool. Sheesh.  Dude, stop being so judgeamental. (Mr. Autocorrect, what do you mean it is spelled judgmental?) Like I have been mispronouncing this word the whole time, and no one bothered to correct me?!? I'm gonna need a minute.  Okay, I am good now. Learning something new everyday. Check.  So, yes, where was I? Before I had my imaginary rehearse conversation and learning to spell a new word in the process... Ellis Island's famous hidden gem full slab of Babyback Ribs for a steal of $12.99. The \"Village Pub & Poker\" locations might serve that on their menu!!! I know for certain the location on Eastern as you gradually drive away from the bright lights of Las Vegas and gaining elevation heading towards the rich neighborhood in Anthems have it on their menu. But not their not quite as famous BBQ Chicken (bartender told us each location may have slightly different items on their food menu).   In fact comparing to the restaurant menus between Village Pub and Ellis Island BBQ, the selection is way larger and more diverse than just the Ribs or BBQ Chicken or 1/2 Ribs & 1/2 Chicken Combo served at Ellis Island BBQ. I am still surprised that the two businesses share at least some of the same owners/investors. Like, I use like a lot, sorry annoying habit like a bad proverbial drug addiction, I would be promoting the heck out of this fact that you can get $12.99 full rack of Babyback Ribs without driving to Ellis Island. And they have locally brewed beers that Ellis Island brews on tap here! Size of the glass is smaller here, but still, pretty good trade off for the beers and food option without the long drive.   And it is open 24 hours a day!   You do have to be buzzed in after hours. And make sure whoever works inside can see you on their camera. I was wondering why the door was locked and when my friend pressed the buzzer and walks away to talk on the phone, nothing happened, and we just waited outside for 15 minutes. At least the weather was finally nice and early fall-like.  Anyway, service was friendly (we were obviously seated at the bar section with the video gaming machines), food came out pretty fast. The Ribs was not quite as good as the ones I've ordered at Ellis Island, but still better than most other nearby options. My friends enjoyed the beer selections. The side Sautéed Vegetables is pretty big, if you just want something healthier to munch on. The Root Beer Float looks good too (not even sure if you can even order it at Ellis Island BBQ, since I am usually too full to order that after the usual order of full slab of ribs).  So I would most likely be back again (after hours), since during normal biz hours I most likely would hit up Crafts Kitchen or try out Burger Joint, both are located in the same plaza.  Bonus: Their restroom is clean and bigger than I though it might have been. Might just have been cleaned too."}
{"text":"it sux i used to love eating here there full rack of ribs is awesome for only $12.99 but no i found out there is a $2 up charge to take it to go.. then the waitress also told me on all daily specials and just there ribs they charge an extra $2 to take it to go!! really!!! fucking lame!!  i dont see anywhere on this board there is a $2 charge for to go orders!!!   the $2 pays for the to go container and plastic silverware  if this food makesxme sick because the waitress n hostess went back there to talk to the cooks then there will be more to come !!!"}
{"text":"First visit ordered Chicken with Portabello Mushrooms, Chicken Fingers and Steak Sandwich.  The Chicken Portabello was tough and you could barely cut it, it was as if it has been frozen and thawed quick in microwave. It tasted terrible and sorry to say I have been sick all evening from the food.  I did not order the Chicken Fingers or Steak Sandwich, but was told that the Chicken Fingers were good. The steak sandwich was tough and not good.  Needless to say the Steak Sandwich and Chicken Portabello Mushroom went in the trash.  Bottom Line... You get what you pay for, what a waste of money!  Lesson Learned!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is located in a very nice area. Food is always great. Only complaint is they are not flexible at all...if it comes with fries...no potato salad or other substitution even for an up charge.  I would recommend the chicken basket. The burgers are good also!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at this restaurant on 2/25/14.   Bad manager, bad server and bad kitchen.  This restaurant won't take orders to go over the phone, so I went in person to place my order.   I had choices of sides that did not include a baked potato, so I had to pay extra for a baked potato.  After I paid for my order, including a tip, I never saw my waitress Janett again.  My order was handed to me by a guy.  When I got home, exhausted and starving, ready to have my dinner, the baked potato was missing.  I immediately called the restaurant and a guy at the bar responded.  I had to call twice because the first time I was left on hold and nobody answered.  When Janett finally came to the phone, I told her that my order was missing the baked potato and she apologized and asked me to go back to the restaurant to get it.  Easy to say right?  I let her know of the great inconvenience she had created.  The worst part was the way in which they handled my justified complaint. The manager told the waitress that \"next time\" they will give me a free baked potato.  Really?  Is that their best way to compensate a customer that had to drive back to the restaurant because the waitress was an incompetent that failed to check my order?  Next time?  I am not a regular customer at this restaurant.  Do they know where I live?  What make them believe that there will be a next time?  I didn't place an order from a fast food restaurant.  This is a well established restaurant and they should know better.  I don't care for freebies due to mistakes of this sort.  No freebie can compensate for the aggravation  caused by a wrong order and having to drive back to the restaurant.  But it helps to deal with the frustration when you see a manager who shows a genuine concern and try to do something to keep a customer happy.  This old restaurant is located in an upscale community.  Where is the class?    Village Pub in Summerlin failed in service and customer relations. The manager, the waitress and the kitchen were a fail.  No, there won't be a next time."}
