{"text":"Would be an ok joint if the cost were reduced by about a 1/3.  However, as it stands, mediocre (though high quality) food that is WAY overpriced, especially considering many better options within the surrounding blocks."}
{"text":"Prices on the high side.  Food mediocre.  Service terrible.  90 minutes of my life I will never get back.  Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Their mushroom soup and seared scallops are so good I had them two nights in a row! I always stay at the Concourse and these are automatically in my list!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the past few days.  On Monday, I got the eggs and hash which was very good but the eggs were overcooked.  A little steep in price since coffee does not come with the meal.  Had the eggs benedict the next day which was also very good.  This morning I had the eggs and hash again, and to my surprise, the dish looked different.  The eggs were cooked much better(not overcooked) and there were micro green on top of my dish which looked really nice and complimented the dish perfectly.  Why this wasn't on the dish two days prior, I don't know.  Consistency is key here.  Overall a good place to eat.  The only other things I would say is to make sure the mats are cleaned especially since the rim of my mug was dirty from the mat, and clean the salt and pepper shaker."}
{"text":"Came her by myself to have dinner, had the french onion soup and whiskey pork shank. The meal was good and it wasn't out of the extraordinary. The french soup had a very strong flavor, the pork shank was very soft but was missing something."}
{"text":"After leaving a nearby restaurant due to an extremely rude hostess, my friends and I opted to try out CIRC for lunch.  What an oasis!   First, the salad bar is $11 and it is first rate. Three hot soups, fresh salad bar, antipasta salads and meats, smoked salmon, and a dessert bar.  Hearty bread, vegan options, fresh fruit.  It lived up to the \"Best Salad Bar in Madison\" claims.  It exceeded my expectations.  Second, the staff was first rate. The hostess upon hearing we were in town for the Garden Expo shared with us her knowledge of the area and drew us a map to the Olbrich garden.  She was so incredible!  Our waitress was equally as kind, she made a special effort to get change for me so I could put money in the meter outside...even though it was lunch hour and this place was hopping....she did not bat an eye when I made this request.  Third, the atmosphere is modern AND comfortable...how did they pull that off?. Ha ha.  It really was quite comfy.    My friend ordered a flatbread with steak and blue cheese.  It was an excellent, very tasty flatbread.  The only negative was that it didnt come with anything and she said it would have been nice to have a bowl of fruit or something to balance out the taste of the blue cheese.   The other negative was coffee was $3, that seemed a little high.    I would not hesitate to recommend CIRC as the BEST lunch salad bar in Madison.  My friends and I do plan on stopping again in our next outting.  I could tell from how busy they were I'm not the only one who likes this place."}
{"text":"Had room service dining at the Concourse Hotel from Circ. I had the cubano sandwich. It was excellent. Wife had the Mac and Cheese. Great. Both agreed the fries were among the best we've ever had. Food was very tasty and well presented. Will have to visit again to dine in the restaurant. Presentation top notch."}
{"text":"Located inside of our hotel we conveniently dined for breakfast. We did a walk through of the continental buffet and decided not to partake because it didn't look worthy of $12. Likewise it wasn't worth $15 for made-to-order entree w/ continental buffet because breakfast dishes by themselves were cheaper to order. The continental buffet was fruit, yogurt, bread, and oatmeal. Platters were not filled and everything looked low in stock. Not appealing. We ordered an omelette which was egg folded over the ingredients. Ingredients were not mixed in with the egg. Thus, doesn't really qualify as an omelette. Also ordered the short rib benedict. Both entrees came with breakfast potatoes and ketchup as dipping sauce (assuming we like ketchup with our potatoes ??). Food was good. No complaints. Service on the other hand, was slow and for as little clientele as there was, food took a while. For what you end up paying, I would skip this place and get breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"I LOVE a good salad bar and I had heard good things about CIRC. The salad bar at CIRC did not disappoint. It's not the largest buffet you will see, but for a Salad Bar buffet it is phenomenal. All quality ingredients, the staff kept everything clean, the price was reasonable, AND there were some tasty prepared items, yummy desserts, and a pretty decent selection of non-salad items.  There were four soups to try. I had the cheese and chorizo. It was fine, but not my favorite. At the salad bar were mixed greens, spinach, iceberg lettuce, peas, garbanzo beans, egg, grilled chicken, bacon bits (not the canned stuff, but real bacon pieces), blue-cheese, peas, carrots, radishes, beets, cucumbers, mushrooms, I'm forgetting a dozen ingredients, but all seemed fresh. Probably eight different dressings. Also croutons, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, pretty much everything I look for in a salad.  They also had smoked salmon, sliced salami, a variety of cheeses, fruit pieces. For prepared foods there was a Bulgar-type salad, rice-noodles, green-bean salad, lettuce wedges w/bacon, tomato, and blue cheese dressing. Dessert include cookies, brownies, a cherry crisp, and some strawberry mousse items. I'm sure I'm forgetting several items.  For a salad bar I was truly impressed. Not huge like a Chinese buffet, but the quality of all of the ingredients was completely spot on. I was a little skeptical since it's a hotel restaurant and those can be pretty hit or miss but I'll definitely go back to CIRC."}
{"text":"Staying here for conference.  The porkchop is to die for, crisp and soft all at the same time.  Full of juice!  The grilled cheese is my second favorite item, superb!  I have never had a grilled cheese with cheese on the outside!!!  Friendly staff and loved both of the restaurant managers we met.  Awesome food and great prices."}
{"text":"So glad we came here for restaurant week. Great service,  amazing food, and nice ambiance.  Would definitely come back to check out their regular menu. Every dish was superb"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally made it in to Circ for the winter restaurant week 2017. Our server's name was Calvin, and he was absolutely spectacular. He had extensive menu knowledge and checked up on us at the perfect times. My boyfriend ordered the O'so night train, while I had a Sean Minor sauv blanc. We were offered a bread basket with a great grain wheat bread, and delicious rye crackers that I couldn't get enough of! Then our appetizers came out. He ordered the fried chicken livers with a white barbecue sauce- his first time having chicken livers. They were perfectly crispy and crunchy on the outside, while soft and delicate on the inside, and the BBQ sauce complemented them. I ordered the pear and apple salad, with hazelnuts, bleu cheese and bitter red cabbage. While the salad was good in parts, it was essential to get every flavor together in one bite to get the true beauty of the dish. He and I both agreed that while the salad was delicious, there's just no way to beat the chicken livers.  Then came out entrees: I ordered roasted pheasant with mushrooms, smoked pearl onions, and herbed pappardelle pasta. It was delicious, warm, savory, and the smoked pearl onions were so weird but amazing, the dish in whole was, in a word, delectable. My boyfriend ordered the osso buco pot pie. I am a baker, and my boyfriend insisted that I try the crust. It was a perfect, ultra buttery puff pastry round. You could feel every delicate layer, and it was like you were transported somewhere else... it was magical. The osso buco was perfectly tender, warm, seasoned just right, and paired with the buttery puff excellently. Again, while both dishes were delicious, nothing could beat the puff.  Finally desserts came out. He ordered the tiramisu cheesecake, while I ordered the hot sticky toffee pudding with a caramel bourbon sauce. Both desserts paired beautifully with his beer. The tiramisu had the perfect amount of coffee, a crispy yet sturdy crust, and elegantly dense cheesecake in the center, topped with a piece of chocolate disguised as a coffee bean!! My hot sticky toffee pudding was warm, dense, gooey, and warmed the soul. Perfect blend of spices with a little ginger to give a tiny kick keeping it from going overboard. Whether he believes it or not, I won the dessert round.  All in all, with beyond excellent service, and food that left us eating all of it and then feeling overbearingly full after (no regrets), we will definitely be back to dine at Circ, and have already been gushing to those around us about our experience.  Shout out to Calvin- you're the best!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at my lunch reservation a bit before my 11:30 reservation for a party of 8 and had to wait a bit before the table was ready. Overall the service and food were terrible, extremely long wait for our order to be taken, coffee refills and when the food arrived it was cold. After I brought this to the waitresses attention she made excuse after excuse and ultimately brought over one plate of breakfast potatoes for the table to share. Completely unacceptable... not worth the money you'll spend. You'll be better off someplace else  Also no turkey sausage, only pork friendly breakfast meat options"}
{"text":"Where to begin, this restaurant is located on the main floor of the Concourse Hotel. It serves small portions (think French cuisine). Figure on two or three menu items per person. My wife an I both ordered two items and beer. I had mushroom soup and braised flank steak, my wife ordered potato gnochie and soba noodles. Dinner was served with what appears to be fresh bread and butter. The meal was filling especially the soba noodles. It was however a bit bland, we expected more flavor. The mushroom soup is brought to the table in a small carafe and a bowl of mushrooms, the server pours the hot soup over the mushrooms in the bowl and it ready to eat. The flank steak is braised in tomato puree and served with fingerling potatoes. The potato gnocchi was the best part of our meal. The docs noodles has mushrooms, vegetable, and a soft boiled egg. They do offer larger portions of certain dishes and have specials. It cost us just over $50 for four menu items and two beers. I'm sure the majority of their business is from business travelers during the week, we stopped in on a Saturday night before going to a show at the nearby Overture Center. The restaurant was fairly slow. Service could have been better considering it was slow."}
{"text":"I checked in to the Madison Concourse Hotel and dropped into Circ for an early dinner before an evening of meetings. It's an upscale restaurant with modern decor, beautifully decorated. I was greeted by the host and sat within seconds of arriving. My waiter was Dan, very professional, friendly and knowledgable. Dan gave me some recommendations and he did not steer me wrong. I had the warm beet and arugula salad and the scallops for an entrée both were so good!  I'd order them again. I had the vanilla bean cheesecake for dessert which was a perfect size, about three bites...really, who ever wants more than that??  Bonus-dessert was only $3.00. Overall, this place is a solid restaurant, great ambiance, superb staff and one heck of a chef. Try it!"}
{"text":"In  Madison for a conference. Enjoyed a delicious late breakfast here this morning. Had a three-egg omelet with bacon, ham, and Swiss cheese folded inside, along with a unique take on a side dish of potatoes, toast, and bottomless coffee. The omelet was done perfectly (not too greasy) with a generous portion of meat and cheese (bacon was done, not too fatty or still \"wiggly\"). The potatoes were whole, sliced relatively thin (thicker than potato chips - maybe 1/8\") and fried to a crisp perfection  - again not greasy. Very hearty!  Friendly, attentive service."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent a weekend at the Madison Concourse Hotel and decided to try out this restaurant the first night. We called earlier that week and a made reservation for a 7:30 dinner on Friday evening which turned out to be totally unnecessary since there were literally two other diners in the entire restaurant. It was really odd to be in such an empty restaurant on Friday night, especially since the restaurant is slightly open to the lobby and guests walk through it to get to the Starbucks.   The food was inconsistent  - we had the ceviche to start, which ended up being the highlight of the meal. Our entrees were fine, but a bit bland. My husband had the lamb, which was fatty and over cooked and I had the brisket bolognese, which was fine but I wouldn't get it again. The waiter and host were funny and gave us great service.   We wouldn't go again, especially with so many great options in the area, but I do recommend the ceviche."}
{"text":"After dining here on more than 4 separate occasions, I can't comprehend the less-than-4-star review. Food and service is always great for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice selection. I had the buffet and it looked like most people chose that options as well. I got yogurt with yummy granola, fresh strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. I also got bacon and a bit of eggs. Very good! Not a fan of the raspberry danish but I haven't been able to find a good danish in years. It was a peaceful, clean environment. Just what I needed!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Circ since I am staying at The Madison Concourse and the reviews were good. Plus freezing rain was falling outside and I did not want to go out.  I was warmly greeted and seated right away. It was a Tuesday 6:30 pm, so it was not very busy but it should have been considering the quality of the food. I started with the Beef Tenderloin Skewers. They were perfectly cooked and very tasty. The skewer also had button mushrooms on it that were very fresh and had a nice woodsy taste. To top it off, they were served on a generous helping of onion cream. The best way to describe it would be to say the best parts of French onion soup as a cream. My entree was a full order of Fettuccini with Ciliegine Mozzarella and black pepper seasoning. Now, they didn't say the fettuccini was fresh hand made but it sure tasted like it. Perfectly tender but with a nice chew, just like pasta should be, says me. I don't know what Ciliegine mozzarella is but I know I want more. I paid $35 for a single meal, which is reasonable given downtown Madison's prices and the service and food quality I was given. I can only hope my work sends me for more Epic training so I can come back to Circ."}
{"text":"I had just arrived to the Madison Concourse Hotel for a conference when the rain started. Since I was hungry and umbrella-less I ate at CIRC.   My order was a simple soup and salad. The salad was unimpressive and reminded me of the side salads served at chain restaurants. As for the soup, it was so salty I could not even finish it! I went back to my room hungry and unsatisfied.  Lots of great places in Madison so if you're at this hotel (which I enjoyed other than my visit to CIRC) I'd suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my very first Yelp review. I came on here just to write about the apple pie at Circ. It is delicious.   I'm not even an apple pie person because I'm partial to pumpkin.   The contrasting texture of the crust and fruit filling is perfect. The crust is not too thick or doughy. The proportion of crust to fruit in each bite is just right. The dessert is just sweet enough to really allow the spices to stand out. Sometimes apple pie is so sweet that I am not able to enjoy the different flavors.   I ordered this pie last night and then again tonight. I see another serving in my future very soon.   Other things to note about Circ: the staff is very attentive without buzzing around and the small plates make it possible to enjoy a variety of dishes. [Note: I am giving four stars for the restaurant overall because the cocktails are about average, but not bad, and the food itself did not stand out dish after dish--it was hit or miss on the small plates and entrees.] I have been sampling cheese curds all around the state for a few months now and Circ's are, so far, my very favorite. I'm not sure what criteria those from Wisconsin use to judge cheese curds, but my LA palate likes these ones very much."}
