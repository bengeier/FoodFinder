{"text":"Wow,  what an Incredibly friendly and welcoming staff!   The large calzones are perfectly proportioned with very fresh ingredients and are big enough to fill a pizza box! The kid's pasta was as expected and the Greek salad was freshly made to order.  Much better than we anticipated!"}
{"text":"Simply one of these best take out restaurants in Kannapolis.  Food is always fresh and tastes good."}
{"text":"New York Pizza has now been open here for now a year or more, and against all my initial predictions.  Their location is in a long-time restaurant building which has been absolutely blighted by multiple turnovers, including the last tenant, an Italian sit-down restaurant. I expected their opening to be just yet another in the long series of these sad failures.   Their success here is an example of why I sometimes enjoy being wrong.   Once I tried their pizza , I learned why they have been able to maintain their business successfully so far.  For this review, we had their Supreme Pizza. Very good,  but slightly greasy. Certainly nothing not to expect, after all it has everything on it. Crust good, slightly under done as I like it. Sauce and toppings adequate, and of good quality.  Very good pizza. Slightly higher -but still reasonable prices.   The North Kannapolis area desperately needed a good independent pizza shop for carryout, and New York Pizza is available to fill the void well.  Final Opinion:   This is a good choice for when you want pizza outside of the usual franchise pizza places which Kannapolis is so infested with.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in town! I recommend the grilled chicken sub and my boyfriend loves the cheese steak sub. I'm not a fan of their pizza or pasta dishes, however overall the food is yummy. They're open late & they deliver. A great addition to a small town."}
{"text":"Love their attention to pizza, and quality. Yummy all around, the wings and pizza specials range in size and flavor, and the fettuccine Alfredo is killer"}
{"text":"Good.,.they need a little bit more crispy crust on the bottom.  Not a very good likeness to NY pizza. I wouldn't return there are better places."}
{"text":"Excellent food, every bite we've had has been great!  Well worth the price!  We are die hard loyalists to a favorite pizza shop in Texas and New York Pizza definitely helped scratch our itch with their tasty offerings"}
