{"text":"One of the most clean T&T supermarket.  Although is not the largest T&T supermarket, but it is well organized, clean and comfortable T&T supermarket, compliments!!  They also having quite Food court that you can purchase the cook food and having it over there."}
{"text":"Good variety of asian food.  Mainly packages and can's. Fresh food section available. Good for spices."}
{"text":"In the former location of Weston Produce an Italian grocer now lies T&T.   Two asian supermarkets in this area. Just up the street is H-Mart a Korean Supermarket.   Highlight, this is the only T&T I've been to that has a Deli department. Probably exists for the former clientele that may have frequented Weston Produce before."}
{"text":"I'm not a native Toronto-an so this is a foreigner's perspective. ;-)  Combine the cleanliness and orderliness of a Canadian or American Grocery with the yummi-ness and exotic-ness of an Asian market and you have T&T.  Bright lights, no funny smells. Orderly shelves, and pretty sanitary food handling practices.  Deli and hot food counters with all the familiar foods that I love.  I would kill for one of these near me."}
{"text":"Stepping into T&T Weldrick location for the first time, I immediately realised that I've been here before. Oh, how disappointing.   This specific location is a preemptive strike on the soon-to-be Chinese populated neighbourhood of..Weldrick I guess? There is no cashier dedicated to the canteen area, I had to pay for my cooked food at the regular check-out, and then make my way back to the canteen. Those few extra steps could very well determine the well-being of my appetite. By purchasing cooked food I am already exercising my laziness on the economy. With these extra steps, I am forces to direct my energy to walking them, rather than eating what I buy, thus possibly lowering the amount of food--and consequently the money I spend. This is not a good business move for T&T.   The parking is atrocious in this plaza. It was not designed to handle the traffic such a retailer would produce. The front entrance is missing the 'occasion' ambiance of a large Chinese grocer. The interior feels like just another grocery store. I've probably seen the worst interpretation of a Chinese lion during Chinese New Years here. It looked like a bad drawing make from boxes of cheap moon cake and candy. The lights were far to amber, thus giving the food here the expired feeling. This location is simply very weak. This feels like a forced T&T location meant to manipulate the public perception of the brand. Unfortunately, they've got the wrong idea.  I suppose there is a reason why my actual first visit was suppressed in my mind. I can barely recall enough detail to write this review."}
{"text":"Lots of expired/bad produce. Their baked goods are very interesting. Those never go bad for days even on hot summer days."}
{"text":"What's up with these Asian superstores not bagging customers groceries? T&T is the last \"Asian\" store I'd want to see that.   9/10 times I see the cashiers just shoving the groceries aside and customers hurrying to bag them. What's worse is they seem to only bag for the customers who purchase their own bags.   Customers shouldn't be doing any part of what a paid cashier suppose to do. Least in my opinion. Would give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I saw headless, furless rabbits when I walk by their meat section today.  I almost puked my lunch and dinner out.  Me and my friends will be boycotting t&t until they stop selling these innocent pets as meat!"}
{"text":"I come here mainly for their fresh produce and the middle eastern sections. Yep this is the best middle eastern store in the area. I do browse around for noodles and sweets from their bakery. They also have a nice meat shop and a seafood section.  In regards to their precooked meals sushi is alright, but I have been spoiled by AYCE restaurants that I can't justify spending anything more than $10 on a sushi tray. Steer away from their grilled chicken.  Store is clean and tidy. There is plenty of parking space."}
{"text":"Battlefield T&T Location  -  Weldrick Day  -   2 ----------------------  I was assigned the Rookie on this mission, PAIN (Parking was too).

{"text":"Umm T and T is the best place ever.  I like to spend hours browsing.   This is my fav . location because I come here the most, and it caters to different ethnicites as well. Lot's of indian, and phillipino items as well!  The store is maintained pretty well, and the fishy smell isn't really there like other T and T locations.   Right next to the Weldrick Viva Stop.  Also, its open till 10 ERR NIGHT! :D"}
{"text":"So this is a T&T like any other - a bit older, but still the same merchandise.. They're owned by Loblaws now so you find some PC products too, which is nice if you want a few western items along with your other stuff.  Came into this one while in the area craving a banh mi (Viet sub) - the T&T at Woodbine/16th always has them and they're cheap $2-$3.  No problems getting it, but dang this was the worst one I've ever had.  Cheap-o mortadella and the hardest bun I've ever had.  Terrible.  It was a store-packed one so I'll make sure to look for/stick with the ones made by the specialty shops that they stock in Markham (and maybe here too - if I looked harder).  Anyways, unfair to knock them down too much just because of a cheap-ass sub, so giving 3 stars, since the rest of the store seems pretty consist with others I've been to."}
{"text":"this is my favorite T&T! Even more so than the flagship store in Markham. I love the adorable Russian man at the deli counter and I like that the deli counter has a great selection and it almost feels like a European deli store.   I adore the prepared foods section for its fried shrimp and fried smelt. I also enjoy (very much) the deals at the end of the day (buy 3 get 1 free).  They have decent store sushi if you need a quick fix, nothing fancy but always fresh and curbs the craving.   At the end of the day they put all the prepared foods into containers and sell them at a cheaper price, and the meat too!! Pork, marinated and soft and delicious, along with rice, noodles, seafood with veggies, fried rice with shrimp and cheese (!!!).  Unlike the Markham store, they have cold food (marinated pig ears, seaweed salad, beef tripe with chilies) at a self serve table so you don't have to bother the nice lady to pack you a container.   Veggies are fresh, there are sales all the time, fish is on sale every week - grab a flier and head to this heavenly piece of Asia in Richmond Hill. You will NOT be disappoined. There are huge lines on weekends though - fair warning."}
{"text":"I like that this store is pretty clean, easy to find parking and close to where I live. The cons though is that the store is quite small, not a lot of selection and I don't find the fish /meat quite as fresh. Usually I come here if I need to buy something small but otherwise I rather go to the highway 7 and woodbine store or Steeles and Warden store. I'd give this a 3.5 stars (rounded up)."}
{"text":"And with that, I visited all six T&Ts in York Region. I still need to visit the Mississauga branch in order to complete the GTA sweep, but I don't see myself doing that in the near future unfortunately.  This store, although smaller than the others, has a surprisingly large variety of foods. They really focus on the produce as well, with about a quarter of the supermarket dedicated to them. In addition, this store has a cold cuts counter: The first I've seen from all stores I visited. The seafood, meat, and cashier employees were all very attentive and provided good service.  While the store had variety in produce and cold cuts, it lacked variety in organic products. There was a small counter of organic produce right at the front entrance, however the meat section lacked a huge selection of organic foods...in particular, I did not see any organic chicken breasts. The Unionville store tends to be stocked with them, but not this store.  Overall, I like this store. Compact, yet respectable variety of foods. I didn't have trouble finding parking as well."}
{"text":"Shopped at this location for the first (and last time) as we were far away from our usual T&T shopping location.  Not much of a variety --- small selection of vegetables, fish was meh, meat was meh and the food court was out of everything that we normally get at T&T.  In short, we did our shopping but still have to go shopping.  No line ups at the cash registers like our regular T&T (because fewer people seem to be shopping here) - I will not be running back.  Do not make the large vegetable steamed bau (su cai bau) and other regular items which are available at every other T&T, just pork available.  They seemed to have a good selection of Philippine imported products.  Comparing this location to the other T&Ts at Warden or the Steeles (near Markham) store, this location did not hit the high note for me."}
{"text":"Your regular T&T - the advantage of this location is convenience, right off yonge, but the seafood section isn't nearly as good as the woodbine location.... so come here for the essentials."}
{"text":"This T&T is probably further from me than the one at Woodbine & 16th, but I still prefer this one because it's less crowded and it's easier to find parking (easier doesn't mean easy though). I like a good choice of groceries they carry. Prices are reasonable and you can use your credit cards unlike some other asian grocery stores. I wish they had more cashiers present at any time, sadly lineups are an issue even when the store is relatively empty."}
{"text":"This place is literally the coolest. If you ever want to make bubble tea homemade T&T sells tapioca pearls so you can make your own bubble tea! Not only is this supermarket is cool, they have AMAZING prices. And my favourite is when I leave the store I can get a keychain for $2! I know it's for kids but it's cute and cheap for a keychain that's well worth the price. Definitely recommend this store! They have almost everything."}
{"text":"The 20th T & T Supermarket in Canada and 6th in the GTA area has opened June 10th in the Richmond Hill area.   Since it is only the 2nd day after their grand opening, this place was packed... long lines at the cash...and people everywhere..!!! I kept running into people, bumming into everything, shopping carts hitting me...   The Chinese grocery selections was comparable to other T & T locations. As this Supermarket is located in more cultural mixed residential areas, there are also a good selections of Filipino food and even has a Deli Corner that selling cheese and deli..   As T & T has now be brought out by Loblaws, similar shopping bags policy has been adopted, 5 cents per bag or bring your own!   My Mango Tapioca Cup is on special for $1. Great as a light dessert... liquid dessert!  Oh and their bakery has much better offerings than the other T & T I been to... A Burger looking Chocolate mousse cake ($20).. I know what to get Brian Y for his birthday!! :)"}
