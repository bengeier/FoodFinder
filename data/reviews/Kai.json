{"text":"We've come here several times in the last 5-6 years, but our recent visit early this month was a disappointment. 

The food has always been amazing, service impeccable, and we keep recommending this place to everyone who may enjoy food. 

However, it looks like they are making some transitions and it's not too smooth yet. 

New chairs- so heavy they will cause injury. Boots are recommended. 

The food was fine, just not memorable. 

Tastings were few and we had to ask for bread, which is usually served automatically. We got one tasting between courses and we did get a complimentary dessert since we were there for my birthday. Typically there are at least 3 tastings and so that was definitely a loss. We do have some dietary restrictions but it's never been a problem since the chef always has made adjustments. 

There is a new chef and they are making changes and a new menu. I hope that it's a good change- I am sadly more likely to try a different place rather than try here again. 

This was a place I would say WAS a bucket list highlight, and I hope that they manage to revive it."}
{"text":"Just returned from a memorable dining experience.  We live in Ahwatukee and have been trying to occasionally make it there for the past few years.  But never seemed to be able to get a reservation within a few days of the desired reservation.   Now, I understand why.  Now, i am upset that i did not try harder to dine at Kai!  Definitely a fabulous dining experience.  My last similar experience was when Mary Elaine's still existed at the Phoenician.

The Duck plate was stupendous. The escargot was bursting with flavors.   The squash puree was unbelievable.  And I could continue on...  If you are not a so called foodie, you will think this place is priced too high and or not enjoy the nuances of each course and plate.

The service was fantastic down to the thank you card waiting for us in our car!   I had given up many years ago with finding this type of food and service in the valley.  

Our hats off to the chef and the staff.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was an unbelievable dining experience. The food was amazing. The service was...  The service was so good it was ridiculous. Going to a typical restaurant again after experiencing Kai is just depressing.

But you do pay for it. Still 5 stars, still worth every penny we paid... but there's no denying that it was a whole lot of pennies to pay."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Chandler. It is pricey but it is 100% worth it. They have the best service and quality food. I love taking friends here. They are so impressed by the staff and excellent food. My favorite is the fry bread. Always call for reservations or go on open table since this place tends to fill up.  This place is Chandler's hidden gem"}
{"text":"I was staying at the resort for a meeting, and when I found out that such a unique restaurant was here, I had to try it.  And luckily, my close friend had traveled with me, so together we shared an incredible meal here.  The menus were printed on a menu with beautiful Native American art -we ordered the 5-course tasting menu.  The menu showcases local ingredients and the waiter told us that the chef tries to incorporate the history of the local tribes into the food.  I don't recall everything that we ate, I do recall a lobster dish, as well as a filet of bison.  Yum!  For dessert, to my joy, was souffle!  Souffle is my favorite, and this came with a warm gooey sauce to top it off.  A special mention that the cocktails were very good, I had a couple of martinis that were phenomenal.  Would definitely come back.  If I lived locally, this would definitely be a special occasion place, as it is pricey."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Phoenix! You go on a cultural journey with the food and presentation, and it's fantastic! Bar service is top notch (knowledgeable and super friendly) and live music adds to the already perfect ambiance. We come for every special occasion, and 'just because'. Make it part of a weekend staycation at the Wild Horse (resort, not casino, though that's fun too!), throw in a spa day and you'll be as hooked as we are!"}
{"text":"I don't want to give away too much. All you really need to know is that every single bite was delicious. The entire staff was thoughtful and kind. I plan on eating here every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I ate here for a business meeting - I knew it was a nice restaurant but am ashamed to admit I did not know it was a AAA 5-diamond. I was a little taken aback but the decor is so simple so you would never know it when walking it. 

What you immediately notice is the service and attention to detail. The hand-painted menus, Pima language in your introduction, and courses representing life's journey. They had me at \"would you like a slice of key lime, cucumber, lemon, tangerine, cucumber...for your water?\" ....now that's attention to detail. 

The chef sent out a special amuse bouche of buffalo tartar - I don't remember .I had the heirloom tomato, goat cheese & marscapone tart - it was the size of a muffin tin but I could have eaten a pie plate full. It was a delightful layering of sweet, creamy and tangy and the \"black ice\" was black gold - sprinkled ice crystals of reduced balsamic magic. 

Another special chef treat was a palate cleanser of pomegranate and pepper sorbet served in a small metal bird's nest like dish. I skipped the rest of the journey and went straight for the buffalo tenderloin. I have never had buffalo like this...buttery medium-rare with local flavors of saguaro blossom and cholla buds. 

Coffee was served tableside in individual French presses - my favorite. (Maybe I'm not such a country girl after all)  3 hour dinner, too bad I didn't valet park and get the thank you gifts mentioned in other reviews!

Most people probably can't get over the price - it was amusing to see different guests (ages, socioeconomic status, etc.) and their attitudes toward the experience.  All dress seems to be welcome - I had to laugh because there was a couple that totally looked like the Carl's Jr .steak sandwich commercial - she's in a bright blue spandex dress and he's in campshirt  and shorts....Arizona is casual but have some respect. 

My country upbringing and lack of exquisite dining experience was growing uneasy with the constant service, being called Ms. all night long, etc. but I slipped into the luxury quite easily...life is good, exceptional food is bliss and Kai should be a goal for everyone to splurge on."}
{"text":"Wow! January 28, 2011, we had dinner at Kai. The only negative I have to say is it's a long way from anywhere. We started out getting to the restaurant a few minutes early where we were able to watch & listen to a duo (bass & electric guitar,) player that were just incredible. The guitar player was playing SRV not missing a lick. Onto the culinary experience. Apps, dinner & fresh drip coffee,  plus my wife KJ had a nice glass of wine.
Feliciano our waiter was tremendous and handled us with integrity & care that a five star restaurant must do to = 5 stars. . The assistants were around when we needed anything and the close was handled with a handwritten note and two boxes of chocolates. 
I will return to Kai each time  I visit  the Scottsdale/Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place does deceivingly sound like a hotel but it is in fact a restaurant as I found when I looked online after hearing about the place. But it was definitely an awesome restaurant to go to, nonetheless. 

The food was definitely different but it was pretty good, but it was all a little overpriced for my liking and whilst I did appreciate the great presentation I didn't want to have to pay that much for the meal. However, the service at the restaurant was really great. 

The staff at the restaurant were really friendly and had great personalities which really did make the experience much better and I would definitely go to the restaurant again but it won't be my first choice and while I definitely appreciate and thank the staff for the great service the price was too much for me especially since the food could have definitely been better."}
{"text":"Visited by myself after noting the restaurant was listed as a AAA five diamond restaurant. I don't know where to begin, but I cannot say enough good things. I'll start with it is worth the drive if you are contemplating making the 30-45 minute drive from the Phoenix-Scottsdale area.

Upon arriving for my reservation, I was greeted by valet, who gave me a ticket and directed me to Kai after I informed them it was my first time visiting. Along the walk, the gentleman concisely informed me on various aspects of the property before handing me off to the hostess that sat me at my table. Once at my table, I noticed the Native American influenced decor and observed the impeccable service delivered throughout the night as I sat behind other diners where everyone faced the same way.

In the dimly lit restaurant, I received nothing short of exceptional service where each complementary dish was explained and there was no guessing on where the food was sourced from as it was all explained, which was a nice touch. I ordered a glass of cabernet that paired well with my Bison Tenderlion featuring smoked corn puree, cholla buds, chorizo, scarlet runner bean chile, and dots of saguaro blossom syrup provided by the native tribe.

The eclectic food from the Native American Kai tribe was worth every cent. The experience was noteworthy and one I will never forget."}
{"text":"If ever a Phoenix area restaurant were deserving of 6 stars, this is it. Kai is one of the most exceptional dining experiences you'll ever have. It starts with complimentary valet, then walking into the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort's beautiful lobby, with murals on the ceiling and a large fountain representing the Gila River, and finally to the hostess desk, where you're greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. The dining room at Kai is casually elegant and boasts beautiful views - be sure to go before sunset. You'll also notice the lovely paintings by a Native artist, which also decorate the front of the menus. But what really sets Kai apart from the rest of the wonderful foodie destinations in the city is the extraordinary service. From the choice of four accompaniments for your water at the beginning of your night to having your car ready for you out front with two bottles of Voss, chocolates, and a personal hand-written thank you note from the server at the end of the night, you will feel pampered like royalty.

The food at Kai truly is unique and exceptional, focusing on local ingredients whenever possible and blending Native cuisine with French, Spanish, Mexican, and other diverse influences. Few people seemed aware of this, and they don't promote it at the restaurant, but they currently offer a $59 \"Kai Cares\" menu where you get three courses of their most popular dishes - hand picked lettuces app, grilled buffalo tenderloin entree, and traditional fry bread dessert. These items would normally cost you $74, so it's quite a good deal. We did one of these meals and also did the lobster degustation app and the grouper entree. Everything was spectacular, perfectly cooked, and bursting with amazing flavors. I was a little worried buffalo would be a rougher meat, but it was tender like a filet mignon. In addition, we received an amuse, a sorbet intermezzo, and chocolate truffles after dessert, which are such elegant touches that really enhance the experience. And the breads, made in house and served with their own brand of olive oil, were fantastic.

Kai is very deserving of its Mobil 5 Star and AAA 5 Diamond ratings, and is tied with Binkley's for Arizona's best restaurant, IMO. It is an experience not to be missed for Valley foodies, special occasion splurges, or visitors wanting a unique taste of Arizona's Native cuisine."}
{"text":"Kai is perfection.  We enjoyed the 13 course tasting menu paired with wine and it was glorious in every way.  Our main server, Feliciano and our sommelier, Thomas, along with their able staff, guided us through our journey with professionalism and genuine enthusiasm. They know this territory well and demonstrate their passion for delivering a fine dining experience at every turn.

The meal was exquisite.  Each course was inventive, beautiful and incredibly delicious.  The wine pairings were among the best we have experienced anywhere and were pitch perfect.

We live in New York and we thought we'd experienced this level of dining before, but obviously we had not.  Our stay in Phoenix was brief but Kai is something we'd like to experience again, so we will return when we can.

Of course a meal like this comes at a steep price, but it is worth every penny.  Bravo, Kai.  You guys rock!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Kai to celebrate our anniversary this past Saturday and I am SO happy we got a reservation on their last night before they close for several weeks. 

First, I have to say that the staff is amazing. We elected to use the car service and our driver was fantastic. Once we arrived at the restaurant the hostesses greeted us by name and wished us a happy anniversary. The sommelier, Thomas, was personable and recommended great bottles of wine, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had Quentin as our server and he was knowledgeable about the menu, the restaurant and its history. 

The food was 5 star! Although the menu changes, we enjoyed every course we were served. We started with the 4 cheese plate that was excellently accompanied by our wine selection. We then shared the lobster degustation and it was outstanding. We were then presented with an amuse bouche, bison tartar for my husband and a vegetarian choice for me that was delicious. Our entrees were the stars of the evening. I chose the Grouper with quinoa & the Mr. had the scallops. Both dishes were finished with amazing sauces done table side. Dessert was a piping out soufflé with vanilla bean cream and a complimentary chocolate mousse for our anniversary. 

I can't wait to go back once they reopen and introduce their new menu."}
{"text":"The very first impression of Kai, happens before you even leave your house. When the hostess you're making reservations with asks for your name, last name, your dates first and last, whether your celebrating anything special, and if either of you have any food allergies, you can't help but think, what a class act, the hostess alone seemed to put in more effort to assure us a pleasant dining experience than the majority of restaurant servers in service today. 

I chose Kai, based on high recommendations, which is honestly revered in an almost mythical capacity. If you are nitpicking though, which I was (everyone wants to see behind the curtain at some point), the minor hiccups are easy to see. 

*the hostess mispronounced our name. The server began to flounder when I derailed him slightly off his rehearsed prose, improvisation definitely not being his strong suit. Typos littered the cocktail list, showing what appeared to be last minute adjustments for the nights menu, and finally...the \"ambiance\" of  what seemed to be a very basic modified hotel lobby room (ugly carpet and all) was, well... less than magical\"

This all said, If i could give Kai 4 and a half stars, I probably would have. The service as others have said IS nearly impeccable, the dance of waiters circling your table to place plates down in synchrony, each dish arriving slightly incomplete so that the server can perform his oratory introduction to each plates construction, (and on top of this, I am now placing a delicate basil herb foam, blah blah, molecular gastrognomy, etc.) Like I eluded to earlier however, try not to interrupt the shpeal with too many questions or the server might get a slightly annoyed deer in headlights appearance until he finds his way back to where he left off. It is a magical experience, in the same way that Disney Land is magical, if you let yourself go, but instead of kids perhaps we're targeting jaded business men and women, WANTING to see magic in one of Phoenix's most highly lauded Native American Fine Dining establishments....hmn...perhaps the only one for that matter.

* Tomato Tart ($17.)...hmn..now that was one pricey tomato tart. (but it did come with an herbal foam, applied at table)
 
*Escargot ($24.) ....yes but these are MAGICAL snails.

*Buffalo Entree ($47.) ..this was the average price of the entrees.

*Seafood Potpouri ($46.)

*Mesquite Bean Manhattan ($14.) ...delicious.

*Glass of Rose ($13.)

TOTAL COST FOR A MAGICAL KAI EVENING (without bottle of wine) : $171.20 plus tip.

The food was delicious, some of the best we've had in town, was it Native American? *shrug* they told us it was...certain ingredients came from so and so tribe down the way...buffalo certainly sounds like something Indians eat...but Seafood Potpouri from the wild uncharted plains of Arizona? Escargot served in the same way that the mighty Cochise ate his? Well...ok...ill play along with the Native American thing if you want, as long as you keep making it as tasty as it is..."}
{"text":"I went with my husband for my birthday once, and it was the best dinner experience I've ever had. The food was presented like artwork!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. From the most incredible food pairings with multiple flavors with a dish, to staff that was absolutely on top of every detail. I have had the opportunity to eat in some of the finest restaurants both in the States and abroad, I would say this now rates as my best experience."}
{"text":"Kai is an amazing restaurant!  You will not get better service at any other \"fancy\" restaurant in Phoenix.  It's seriously like Cheers...everyone knows your name!  When we arrived at the valet and told him what time our reservation was he immediately asked if we were Mr. and Mrs. Lang.  WOW!  I wasn't expecting that at all! 

I have dined here 4 times and each time as been excellent.  I enjoy that they change their menu regularly.  Although, I will be sad if I can't get the Tomato Goat Cheese and Mascarpone Tart the next time I go.  That is a superb start to the meal!  I also enjoy that they don't do ala carte items.  I enjoy eating what the chef creates, what he thinks will be an excellent meal.  
 
This is a dining experience!  You will spend 2 or more hours there.  Also you will spend approximately $100 per person minimum.  I have been to other \"fancy\" restaurants and paid the same amount for the meal, but none of them can compare to Kai."}
{"text":"I selected Kai when having a special dinner with my son who lives in Phoenix. Binkley's is closed for the entire month of July, but Kai serves very nicely in its stead. While a few dishes were not outstanding (the melon soup and the roast buffalo were only good), other dishes represented the highest level of modernist cuisine (and the cocktails are great). For the main course, the squab is distinguished and as an appetizer the seared Wahoo is enlightened (I wish that I had ordered it other than my son), and it is impressive that the chef brings in Southwestern, Mexican, and Indian flavors. Kai's is first rate."}
{"text":"From the beginning to the end, there isn't another fine dining establishment that compares. Having dined here several times for various occasions, whether it was wishing a dear colleague a send off or for business matters, it's the best.  The use of various tribal foods is the heart of and the very essence of Kai.  It represents the hospitality tradition of the Akimel O'odham."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than five stars. This place is transcendentally good. It is the complete package: food that defies description, service that is on the money and impeccable, and an experience that reminds you what food can mean to your mind and spirit.

My wife and I dined here tonight for our anniversary, and I saved up my Christmas money just to be able to go here. We have never spent this much money on one meal before, but we are both very into food exploration and wanted to do something really special since it has been awhile. We could not have been more correct in choosing this place.

While we waited for our table (we arrived a little early for our reservation), we were provided with a prickly pear fruit drink to start. It was amazing. We got our table exactly when we made our reservation, and we immediately noticed how intently the staff provided their service. Every course delivered to the surrounding tables was delivered individually by one server each in a line of four servers. It was almost like out of a movie. Our server greeted us by name (and continued to use our names throughout the meal), and greeted us in the local native language and welcomed us to Kai. 

I'll try to just hit the high points now so I don't end up writing more of a novel than I'm already onto. One of the sommeliers (yes, ONE of) offered us the wine selections. We went for the cheapest half-bottle they had, but it was still amazing. The menus are bedecked with individually custom-painted watercolors from a local artist. We made our selections, and all were brought to us perfectly timed, and they scraped the tablecloth clean between courses, which I've only seen once before and just feels super classy for some reason.

Between courses, there were small complimentary bites offered. First, before everything, was a single bite of oxtail with a corn salsa and a puree I don't recall with a microgreen sprig. Perfectly seasoned and a wonderful warmup. Then we had our first course. The waiters actually bring out a copper sauce pan to put the finishing sauce on the place right in front of you. I had a Hawai'ian Pomfret with a wild boar bacon sauce and some other things. Appallingly delicious. My wife had the barbacoa sheep with some incredible sauces and a fried egg. I don't remember the exact dish and the menu online isn't exactly the same one they had tonight in the restaurant. 

Next we got some bread, three different kinds, with a local olive oil and a mixture of crushed nuts. Again, all was preposterously good. The second course we split, which was the lobster three ways: butter braised with grilled avocado guacamole, heirloom cherry tomatoes, and osetra caviar, a lobster knuckle and endive salad with shaved fennel in a vanilla truffle vinaigrette, and a lobster bisque made with ancho and corn and topped with brown butter brioche crumbs. In the words of so many teenage girls: I literally can't even.

Next came a palette cleanser sorbet: raspberry and allspice with a cranberry drizzle. Finally came the main course. I hesitate to even try to explain this because I know language falls short of expressing the abject joy felt by your entire body while consuming perfection, but I will try. I ordered the elk loin wrapped in iberico ham and covered in a jus and truffle emulsion (which they drizzle on the meat before you) along with shaved black truffle (which they shave onto the place in front of you) along with a truffle and wild mushroom risotto. My wife ordered the seared duck breast. She also got a jus drizzle, but the duck was presented three ways: a whole piece, a piece sliced up, and a shredded piece with some other seasonings. She says the shredded duck was possibly the best thing she has ever eaten. The elk loin was gamey, as is to be expected, but the jus and truffle really cut through that and made a complete and rich taste of it all. The beets in the risotto were a bit vegetal for me, but that's just preference.

I could try to put the experience into words, but everything I've typed so far just scratches the surface and is far too many words as it is. Quite simply, if you have the money for a special occasion meal and you love food that is life-long memory making, go here. This is the best meal I have ever had in my life. I embarrassed my wife by doing so, but I asked to see the chef (the chef was actually gone, but the sous chef came out) so I could shake his hand and thank him in person for the incredible experience he provided for me and my wife. 

I have been to a number of amazing restaurants, but few restaurants you will be able to find anywhere in this country will be able to offer such a unique and complete experience. The incorporation of local and native ingredients and styles connects you to the land and history while the creative and beautiful techniques and presentations makes for more than just a delicious meal. It truly is an experience you cannot get anywhere else and that you should not miss."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where to begin. This place deserves five stars for two reasons. One, the food is superb. Everything is done to perfection, and the menu is creative. Two, they really do a great job of incorporating the Southwest into their presentation. (and I DO mean presentation). We were given a full introduction to how the food is chosen, how the menus were hand painted by local Native Americans, and how the local plants are included in their meals. 
As for the food, we all had the \"Kai Cares\" prix fixe, which was only $59, which for that place is great! This included a salad which I believe was the best part. It had greens separate from a small slice of Humboldt fog cheese and some other enhancements which were great. Our meal was buffalo cooked perfectly with just the right amount of flavor. For desert we were served two types of ice cream, marscapone which they torched at your table and three small pieces of flat bread. Two of us also had the wine flight with our meal. We were also served at least four bottles of Voss water which we thought we might be charged for at the end, but were happy to see that we weren't! Along the way, they brought other items provided by the chef which were fantastic as well. 
Going to a place like this was more of an experience than a meal. We were there for about 3 1/2 hours and had a blast. They really go out of their way to give you an experience. 
Now, here's the BEST part. When we got our car from valet, we had two bottles of Voss, a box of chocolates, and a thank you note from our waiter......can you say SWANKY?"}
{"text":"I stayed in the hotel for three days and had dinner once in this restaurant. The service is really good. I had the seven course tasting menu but didn't like the cheese very much. The rest of the courses were great but I would recommend trying the individual dish instead of the tasting menu."}
{"text":"This is my first review and it may be long and I will try and explain an as much as possible, I hope its a good read.

By far the best and most memorable experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I had incredibly high expectations for this restaurant given the awards it has received and the reviews that I have read, yet the experience completely shattered those expectations and raised the bar of a dining experience to a new level for me. 

After the drive from Tucson, I gave the car to the valet and walked right into the hotel. My girlfriend and I had 8:30 reservations from open table, and we arrived about 20 minutes early and checked in with the hostess. We sat in the bar for maybe 5 minutes and were taken to our table in a semi private room (only 2 tables that seat 4 people) where the keep the wine. The hostess asked our names addressing us as Mr. (last name) and Ms. (last name) and it seemed as if the entire staff knew our names after that. We sat alone in the room with two plates and two water glasses, no menus, no utensils, no napkins.

A moment later, our waiter welcomed us and explained some of the background behind the restaurants' Native American theme and said that he would be back with menus. His assistant, then began pouring our Voss water which was chilled in the corner of the room. With our water we were offered: cherry, cucumber, lemon, or lime. 

 As our waiter came back with our menus, each with a hand painted water color on them, he explained the meaning behind each of them and the folklore about them. We placed our orders and waited patiently for our food. Before each course, the assistant would come into the room and first place the utensils on the table, one by one. Each utensil was chilled or warmed based on what the course was. 

My girlfriend was cold so I gave her my blazer to wear, and our waiter offered her a blanket. Yes, they had blankets and she accepted the offer and wore it over her shoulders to keep her warm

[I'm not much of a foodie, so I copy/pasted from the menu and tried to remember flavors]
First Course (complimentary): Pork Belly with sprouts served with a squash puree. This was delicious and a great way to start off the meal.

Salad: Lettuces Hand Picked by Local Farmers & Children of Gila River Crossing School Locally Picked Tiny Greens, Artisan Date Pudding, Timbale of Heirloom Tomatoes & Sobrasada, Ash Goat Cheese & Blood Orange Vinaigrette 

This was presented beautifully in what looked like a cornucopia but spiraled. Foie Gras, a cheese wedge, blood orange, and one other thing was served with it, all delicious.  

Appetizer: Puffed Pillows of Sea Urchin & Day Boat Scallops From the Waters of Baja: Piquillo Pepper & Smoked Paprika Fondue,
Foraged Porcini Mushrooms and Wilted Chard Leaves

Probably the best tasting and most original dish of the night, and our waiters agreed that it was one of their favorites as well. Texture was very delicate but flavors were again, incredible.

Palate Cleanser: Raspberry Sorbet

Served in a dish appearing to be a cracked egg shell, the plate was freezing cold, as was the spoon.

Main Course: Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe Smoked Corn Puree, Barbecue Scarlet Runner Beans, Saguaro Blossom Syrup, Cholla Buds & Warm Weather Mushrooms 

While my girlfriends steak was served with a large steak knife, I was only given a butter knife, and that is all I needed. This was the most tender piece of meat I have ever eaten. There was also chorizo underneath my buffalo that was delicious.

We were then brought warm towels to freshen up before he offered the dessert menu. We didn't intend on ordering dessert, but our waiter offered a complimentary dessert (Indian Fry Bread) because I had already ordered the Buffalo and the Lettuces. They are running a Prie Fix menu for those three courses for $59, which not only saved me $4 off my total but gave me a free dessert. He had already put in the order for it to be prepared so that it would come out timely. I ordered a coffee and my girlfriend ordered a trio of single chocolates. 

Afterward, we were brought out some complimentary chocolates with the check. $165 pre tip, but our waiter did not include the 2nd salad that we ordered. We brought this to his attention and he explained that it was his mistake and he could not take it back. 

I never thought I would be able to spend $100+ per person on a meal and say it was worth every dollar, but it sure was. I would do it again and I do plan to do it again when when I am back in Arizona. 

As we left, our waiter had apparently notified that valet that we were done as the car was already brought up to the front of the hotel with 2 bottles of complimentary voss water and two kai chocolates. 

I probably could have written more and I'm sure I forgot little details about how amazing the service was here but I will finish up and just say 5/5 stars and I look forward to the day when a restaurant can top this experience."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my wife last night for my birthday.  I can best describe our dinning experience by using the best urban adjective I can think of...our experience at Kai was RE-DONK-U-LOUS! 
 
The whole dining experience was like watching a ballet. Every move our waiter (Daniel) and his assistant made was well choreographed, purposeful, and symbolic. 

Each menu cover has a watercolor painting that is designed by local Pima elder Mike Medicine Horse Zillioux (he is also the flute player you will hear in the back ground while you eat). In addition, each menu cover design comes with a story given by our waiter. 

The wine list was extensive and the sommelier was very knowledgeable on the list, but the sommelier self-admitted  that  the list needed some updating since some of the wines listed were not in stock. However, no ding here from us. 

As the sun was sitting, Daniel (our waiter), pulled back one layer of the curtains in our room, which gave an effect of the wonderful colors of a setting sun in the entire dining room. 

After the sun was half way down the Estrella Mountains did Daniel pull back the final layer of the curtains and we were in such awe...

FOOD:

THE BEGINNING (Appetizer)
We started with the Lobster Degustation. This dish was made up of three lobster dishes. The first was a buttered braised lobster tail under an avocado mousse, tear drop salsa, & lobster coral. Second lobster dish was lobster knuckles in sweet corn panna cotta with sour radishes. Third, was a lobster cobbler with mesquite meal & burnt Irish porter cheese (this one was my personal best!)

THE JOURNEY (Entree):
Wife had the Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage Infused Gnocchi. The venison was prepared with a spiced sweet chile & fair trade coffee rub served under a broccoli rabe puree, shaved pecorino & currant jam. Wife describes it has tender and flavorful without any of the game taste that sometimes come with venison.

I had the the Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. This dish was prepared under smoked corn puree, cholla buds, Merquez Sausage (chorizo) and scarlet runner bean chili, and Saguaro blossom syrup. Again, no game taste and very tender. The buffalo was cooked so well that it was like cutting into some butter. WOW! 

THE AFTERLIFE (Dessert):

We had the Creme Brulee Meets Old World which consisted three creme brulee dishes. The first dish was an Eclair inspired creme brulee, which was a mesquite meal choux & lavender custard. Second, was ice cream sandwich inspired. It was made from two pieces of ginger snap in between a Mexican vanilla bean ice cream creme brulee. The final dish was a meringue pie creme brulee that was a masa pastry tart & meyer lemon meringue. Great dessert! 

It was such a wonderful experience! Every detail of our dining experience was thought out carefully. From our forks and spoons being warm to the touch when our main courses came out and to them being chilled when we received our desserts."}

It's the first tribe-owned and Sheraton-operated restaurant to make the national list. At Kai, waiters serve and take away every plate at the same time for every diner at a table. They call every diner by name and place mints and personal thank-you notes inside guests' cars or hotel rooms."}
{"text":"So, I'm not sure what all of the hubbub is all about. The service was impeccable but that is where the five star rating should end. The food was good but way to salty. The overall experience was adequate, not stellar and certainly did not meet expectations. To make matters worse, I told them that we were celebrating a milestone birthday for my husband at the time of reservation and again when we confirmed.  The staff did not acknowledge the birthday as expected and when I mentioned it to the maitre d he could have cared less....most disappointing indeed."}
{"text":"wow.
that pretty much sums up everything.

you know everything was WOW when you can't stop thinking about the place for weeks to come!

the BEST dining experience!
(second best is in Beverly Hills)"}
{"text":"OMG this place makes me cum in my panties....located in wild horse pass resort (which is an awesome resort as well!)....this place is awesome! best restaurant i've eaten in my enitre life! very very pricey but hell worth every penny! attentative staff, great food and very romantic place.

you must eat here!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences ever!  The service is top-notch.  The food is amazing.  Each dish has a subtle mixture of flavors that is complex and oh so delicious.  I loved the buffalo.   I was surprised by how large the portions are.  I could barely eat dessert, and on top of that, they brought out some delectable truffles compliments of the chef to end the meal.  Try to get a seat where you can see the sun set behind the mountains and lake--absolutely gorgeous--what a serene setting.  Oh, and I love the attention to details, such as the artwork on the walls and on the menus, the silverware cooled or heated to the proper temperature depending on the dish it comes with."}
{"text":"Best service! Attentive to detail. Chocolate and Voss water surprise in your car at the end of the night to top it off. Sit outisde on the patio if possible. The view is breath taking."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my wife for our anniversary and it was an amazing experience.  The service is classy & top notch.  The foods are amazing.  The Foie Gras is sublime and the Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo is so tender, you don't really need to chew.  

I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a unique experience."}
{"text":"I went here awhile back after hoodwinking my dad into taking out the family there.  He won't infrequently take us out for a fancy meal when we're all together but this place goes beyond our normal haunts.

I found no faults with the food whatsoever.  Everything tasted just wonderful, all proteins were expertly prepared, and the menu is also quite interesting.  The heirloom tomato tart was divine, as was the duck trio which included foie gras with a sauternes reduction, confit of leg with coffee and the breast meat with lingonberry preserves.

As great as the food was, giving this place even four stars is a stretch.  And this is due to the non-food aspects of the place.  Actually I feel a bit sorry for the chef and wish he had his own restaurant somewhere else to serve this sort of food.  Kai is annoyingly pretentious, and extremely patronizing to Native American culture.  They pretend like it's some sort of homage to the desert tribes but it's really the opposite.  I wished the waiter would shut up after giving us all these greetings in the \"native language\" and talking about the artwork and such.  They call their fry bread \"fry bread from the teachings of the elders.\"  Is that what the elders teach?  How to destroy a culture, build a huge resort on their land and then create an exercise in Western exoticism a la early 20th century Europe?  Did the \"elders\" eat foie gras?

I wasn't impressed by the team of four waiters taking our plates away all at once.  I asked our waiter for water and he forgot so we had to remind him again--or rather my dad did, in his usual surly way.  Sometimes when one gets involved with elaborate service it's even easier to forget the most basic things.

At the end of the day, though, I would go back again (if someone else is paying).  The food is spectacular, and I can suffer a lot for great food."}
{"text":"It would be impossible to add to the superlatives already given here, so I will simply summarize our experience:  My wife and I have been to Kai three times now for special occasions, and each time was an incredible and unforgettable evening.  Over time, we have tried almost everything on the menu, and found every dish to be unique and creative, with the greatest, most complex but enjoyable flavors imaginable.  The incorporation of Native ingredients and flavors is something you will never taste anywhere else.  I never truly understood the phrase \"food is art\" until I ate at Kai.

And Kai carries that theme of \"food is art\" to all aspects of dining, down to the custom hand drawn art on each menu.  The wine pairings are always surprising but perfect.  The dining room faces the mountains to the west, and if you can get a reservation at sundown you will treated to an incredible show of art from Nature.  Even the service is art, highly attentive but never overbearing.  

It's expensive compared to other restaurants, but the experience for us has always been worth far more the price, and we are eagerly anticipating our next visit."}
{"text":"This is probably the finest restaurant in Arizona.  The food is amazing and the service impeccable.  It's a perfect location for a romantic or special occasion meal."}
{"text":"The service and food was top notch. We were handed a specialty juice from the bartender when we entered and our car was waiting with chocolates and waters when we left. The food was amazing. Most of it was locally raised and grown. I am a pregnant pescatarian and they accommodated me, taking out beef broth and ham hocks when necessary. The decor was authentic and locally made as well. The beautiful views were also a plus. This is a splurge that is worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  My hubby and I had our anniversary dinner there. Everything was perfection as soon as we stepped out of our car...from the food to the service.  Our waiter, Kevin, was awesome. I highly recommend it for any occasion.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and ambiance! My husband and I came here for our anniversary and were very impressed. They think of every detail and even gave the valets anniversary cards, bottle water and chocolates on the way out. I highly recommend Kai for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"The most impressive dining experience and food that I have ever encountered. Truly. Impecable. I have been yearning to go again since I left. The reservations were at 730pm. the sun was just setting, the night sky was absolutely gorgeous as you look over the mountains in Scottsdale.It was a hunt to find the place too, which made for a fun story later.
My drink was a lemoncello with a hot chili that was to die for. We had the 'short story' which was only 7 courses :-)  Handpainted ,wood, menus, each menu with a different story told in watercolors. 1 server for each person at our table. Food, incredible. Our whole party was wined and dined to the hilt. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yelp didn't give me enough stars for Kai. One of the ten best restaurants in the country, maybe the world. After a perfect margarita, we went for the 13 course Journey menu, with wine pairing. Four hours later, we were beyond content. The food is full of unique Native American flavors, the setting is wonderful, and the service is beyond flawless. It's worthy of the most special occasions in your life."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Authentic native American inspired menu, exceptional service, and beautiful environment. This is a special place you don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for an amazing birthday dinner.  First off, the service was the best I've ever received.  When we approached the hostess station, we were greeted by name before we even had a chance to say anything.  Throughout the evening, we were addressed by name. You even get a fresh napkin when you return to your seat. Although the service was incredible, it was a bit over the top for me.

I got the Short Story tasting menu.  My bf wanted the Journey, but the waiter said it wasn't available at that time.  Instead, he asked what my bf wanted in particular from that menu, and we got those courses!  The food was good(I'm a picky eater and working on that).  My favorites were the Squash Puree, and the buffalo tenderloin was the best meat I've ever had.  My bf loved all his courses.  He was also satisfied w/his wine pairings.  He thought some were ok, some were interesting, and others were outstanding.  The portions were generous, especially when compared to Binkley's.  I was on the verge of bursting by the end.

Another thing I liked about this place was that they tried to use local foods.  For example, the olive oil was grown on the reservation and pressed at Queen Creek Olive Mill.

I hope to return one day for the buffalo.  I prefer Binkley's since you can choose anything you want for the tasting menu and it's a bit more casual."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Friendly wait staff, amazing food, and beautiful scenery. We will be back!"}
{"text":"At Kai, dinner is an event and an adventure. We had a divine meal. Kai is our hands down favorite at the culinary festival Devoured. Now we know why. Attention to detail and the exquisite talent of the chef and staff shine through each course. Beau had the largest piece of foie gras I had ever seen served. I felt fortunate to finally get there to enjoy the ride!"}
{"text":"Just visited with a group of girls. Great night out. We shared foie gras and chocolate soufflé dessert - both excellent. I had the wagyu beef as a main course and it was to die for. The service and attention is like nothing I've ever experienced. Also, the vodka bar on the way in has fab cocktails. Definitely a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"After wanting to visit this restaurant for over a year, this past September I made reservations for a Saturday night.  OpenTable.com made the process of reserving a table very easy.

Now the part that brought this review down.

Someone from the restaurant had called the day of our reservation, however no one left a voicemail with their name and/or phone number.  Since I don't typically get phone calls from the Phoenix area, I called the number back and was directed to the Sheraton's front desk (not directly related to Kai) where a pleasant lady was able to confirm my reservation.  My husband and I ran late on our reservation, which prompted someone from the restaurant to call us. Again, when I checked my phone, there was a one second voicemail which did not include the caller's name/phone numbers, but again, thankful for caller ID, I called the number and let a different lady know we would be up shortly. So, suggestion #1) have a directly line to your restaurant and #2) please train your staff to please leave their name and contact info when they are unable to reach guests by phone. I think this is only common curtsey for a restaurant known with the best reputation in the whole Arizona state.

Once we walked up to the front desk I must say it was a little awkward meeting a group of young girls. I wasn't quite sure who was checking my party in, but I was impressed that once we were checked in, we were guided to our table and very politely we welcomed as Mr. and Mrs. Salvador.  

Our main servers for the night were Quenton and I believe Richard. Quenton was very knowledgable about the restaurant's traditions and community projects and gave us a quick rundown of how their establishment partners with many local farms and artists to inspire their food and overall atmosphere.  He then left us to review the menu.  Unfortunately this is where I must make suggestion #3) please do not let your guests wait more than 10 minutes to place their order. While we were enjoying some entertaining people watching, we were hungry and we're excited to begin eating.  Having to wait such a long time to place our order was frankly annoying.

For this meal we ordered the Short Story tasting menu with an additional dish of foie gras since we can no longer order foie in California.

Here is a list of what we ate:
-Bruleed fig: Parmesan crisp, Brie, bourbon pecan butter, candied sage
-mesquite charred pumpkin & squash purée: mesquite bean glazed furor pork belly, ahi Amarillo, compressed squash, nopales, and tart apple spume
-potpourri of butter braised lobster, guaymas shrimp & diver scallops: black threads of past, braised tomato, cauliflower and leek fondue, shaved aged gruyere cheese, ham hock bits, and crispy shallots
-seared Hudson Valley foie gras with spiced pumpkin funnel cake: powdered foie gras sugar, caramel iced quince & Bosc pear preserve, aged port and saguaro syrup reduction
-mango-guava and ancho sorbet: raspberry and ginger syrup
-grilled tenderloin of tribal buffalo: smoked corn purée, cholla buds, chorizo and scarlet runner bean chili, and saguaro blossom syrup
-assortment of French cheeses
-two sisters squash air cake: 60-day corn ice cream, mesquite syrup, smoked corn purée, Ramona Farms ga'lvsa, tarragon and amaranth
-Guatemalan coffee
-assortment of chocolate bonbons 

Despite some of the initial flaws I experienced with the waitstaff, I must give credit to the kitchen staff, for they surely are the stars of this establishment!  The food was almost flawless (the pumpkin and squash purée could have been puréed into a smoother consistency), our overall meal was quite beautiful visually and texturally.  The waitstaff acted in great precision as each dish was presented to each guest at the same time, kind of like a well orchestrated dance.  There were moments where my palate wasn't expecting some of the flavor combos, but they were all quite delightful.  There was a definitely moments of surprise throughout this meal!

I would actually rate this restaurant as a 3.5 given the reasons above (some communication misfires and overall extended wait time), but what rounded it up was the well executed food that we enjoyed.

Thank you Kai for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"When I travel, I always try to eat as much native food as I can. Otherwise what's the point of travelling if you don't try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine. I was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native Indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest.

Well, I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here, not just best native Indian dining experience.

The restaurant is located on the Wild Horse Resort complex, which is a native Indian resort offering casino & golf as well as hotel facilities. My only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotel/restaurant was poor, something which I mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with. Just in case it still hasn't, head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage!

There is valet parking available but self parking is no problem. The hotel itself is spacious and Kai is located on the ground floor. Kai is the Pima word for seed and there are many obvious native Indian influences, reflected in many aspects of  the design and architecture - this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they're very rightly proud of here.

The restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. The tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality - for example, the menus are printed on embossed paper.

I think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is 'attention to detail'. I've been lucky to dine in 3 Michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world I've visited beats Kai for attention to detail. Everyone knew my name from my reservation. Cutlery restocked from different sides of the table. New napkins for every visit to the restroom. Crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish!!

The service is also friendly and very informative. There is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service. Foie gras is bruleed at the tableside. Soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers. Multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables.

My server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice. Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water!

Onto the food.  I went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations. 

I was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local Indian flatbread - a local Indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it. This was served with a first rate fruity olive oil.

1. Amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp, crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar. The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil.

2. Avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche. The server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table. My first huge smile moment when I found my chilled spoon! This was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked!! The smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup wasn't too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavours.

3. For a carnivore, I was amazed at the great salad which followed -  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the Gila Crossing School. The salad had a chilli dressing. It was accompanied by date cake with foie gras (yum!), Humboult Fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut.

4. Baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust. The sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction, which activated all my salivary glands. An unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks. The giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree, fried salsify and fennel pollen.

5. Seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that you can't go wrong with seared foie gras with me!

6. Palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce.

7. Grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. The meat was open and evenly textured, tender with a nice gamey flavour. The plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix.

8. Lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce. Chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and I wonder if this is where it originated.

9. Cheese. Belgian soft cheese and a Tasmanian cheddar.

10. Medley of desserts. Corn creme brulee. Fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside. Italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit.

Also lovely to chat to chef de cuisine Jack Strong after the meal."}
{"text":"I'll make this very short.  My wife and I have travelled afar and I would say this ranks as one of the best dinning experiences we ever had. Great service , great food for and great night."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in AZ, so far. I laughed, I cried. The food was to die! I was so impressed, it doesn't matter what you order, this food is made with love and respect."}
{"text":"For my second review I wanted to write a review on a restaurant my wife loves but I felt like a prisoner at. For all you guys out there take your girl there but make sure you visit Jack in the Box before you pick her up. 

The Good... This restaurant food was extremely tasty. Each item we ordered was flavorful on many different levels. this is definitely a Quality over Quantity kind of place. Also, the Specialty drinks were Legendary. That's about it. 

The Bad... Price. More to the point, we dropped about $300 w/ wine and drinks and I was still hungry. We had their full experience menu. Also the service was attentive but not friendly at all. In fact, they were very pretentious. (I had to look that word up) On the Price to experience ratio, this place just isn't worth it. It is however, the kind of place that most guys will end up having to go to. I would avoid this at all cost. There are plenty of other places that serve food that is just as good and isn't as snobby as this place. I would give it one star but seriously, the food tasted great. However the small paper thin strip of Salmon was literally the size of a notepad. You can display it however you want but charging these prices is just not for 95% of us."}
{"text":"First time I went here I set the bar low and this place hurdled it easily. This time I had the bar set high after my first experience and it still crushed it. Hands down best restaurant in Arizona. ONLY 5 STAR RESTAURANT and its obvious. The martinis, whoa. Think Matthew McCanaughy from Wolf of Wall St and just keep them coming!"}
{"text":"Kai should have been incredible - we had the seven journey tasting menu plus some extra appetizers which were fabulous. The presentation was incredible and the attention to detail was extraordinary . I really wanted to give them a five star but sadly I could not because two of the seven  courses were way too salty and they continually rushed us. They would bring one course on top of the next as if they were trying to push us out. When you have an extravagant meal like this you expect to take your time and savor each bite with breaks in between - not have the plates all land simultaneously. The wait staff could not have repeatedly asked us if we needed anything yet be unable to see that they were rushing us - finally we just left with take out containers because we felt so rushed."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for a Mother's Day dinner 
let me tell you how very classy this restaurant everything I have experience inside the restaurant is superb the food was A+ the service is over excellent . I really recommend this restaurant if you are in chandler area in Arizona it's located inside the Sheraton Grand wild horse pass"}
{"text":"Really a terrible disappointment.  WAY overpriced, food is average to below average, service is almost obnoxious, and restaurant decor is like a Holiday Inn restaurant.  Would never go back, even if they offered a free meal.  Waste of time and money, and a horrible disappointment for what was supposed to be a special night."}
{"text":"Kai is certainly a food adventure and most certainly a service masterpiece.  We have eaten here a few times including a small private party in their wine room.  Each time they impress and never leave me feeling like I got rolled.  

By far the most wonderful Foie Gras I've ever eaten has been here and I also had a Buffalo Tartare that knocked my socks off.  Their duck is sublime and I really love how they tie in native ingredients and menu items.  T

he attention to detail in Kai is absolutely mind blowing including chilling or heating your silverware based on the temp of your next dish.  They table crumb and even have a person paying attention to how the sunset gazes upon the inside of the restaurant so they can ensure you never have sun in your eyes... all the while making sure they do not obstruct your view of the beautiful desert in full view.  

If you book a private room I can assure you that you will feel like a champ.  We had eight people and each dish was placed down simultaneously by eight waiters.  Everything is impeccable from the minute you arrive to the minute you hop back on the road.  One of those wonderful examples of being worth every penny if you are a foodie or appreciate fine dining service."}
{"text":"One word - rich.  Yeah, no, I don't mean what you need to be to eat here (although it would certainly help).  The food is delicious but extraordinarily rich.  Let me break it down for you:

*  They offer a choice of fruit or cucumber to put in your water - amazing
*  Rosemary sea salt bread, local fruit bread and garlic bread with local olive oil, nuts & seeds - very good
*  Mesquite bean martini - great!  I always love a smoky variation of my favorite cocktail.
*  Escargot - OUTSTANDING!  The yogurt chip with real truffle was an amazing flavor combination with the escargot and pork in the dish.  It was so good but super rich.
*  Sorbet - could you pick all my favorite flavors and put them into one thing?  I guess.  Coconut cilantro sorbet with jalapeno gooseberry coulis - YUM
*  Squab with sweetbreads - not a fan.  Something just didn't taste quite right.  It's hard to explain the taste but it kind of reminded me of when I was in the elementary school cafeteria, that smell of the dishes being done.  Not good.  One could argue that I just don't like squab but I love sweetbreads and they tasted the same.  Combined with the heavily truffle oiled potatoes it was definitely not my favorite.  Enough with the truffle oil!  Gah...
*  The sommelier recommended a great glass of zinfandel - tasty
*  Décor - sucks.  I spend my life in banquet rooms for work.  Felt like I never left.
*  Music - sad, then sleepy, then food coma.  Ugh.  I appreciate the playing of traditional Native American music, the song choices were just kind of depressing for an extended dining experience.
*  Service - spot on.  The assistant server was especially enthusiastic.  

I dined alone so once the couple that was having an affair left the room, there was no more entertainment.  (It's easy to notice these things when the couple in question has had a few bottles of wine)  Not the restaurant's fault, but I wish the ambiance and music could have been a little more lively.  A heavy meal combined with sleepy time music made it tempting to take a little nap.  Dessert looked good, if only I were able to stay awake.

The thank you note delivered to Mr. & Mrs. H. was a nice touch but I didn't realize that I'd dined with my imaginary husband, or father as the case may be.  He must have been a horrible conversationalist!  If I'd have known, we could have at least shared the buffalo entree and maybe some cheesecake for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant 
First class food and service!
Great place for a special event like anniversary or birthday. 
Highly recommended. 
Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Kai is seriously an experience! My girlfriend and I came here for our 1 year anniversary and I tell you what it doesn't get any better than this. Every dish was exploding with delicate flavors. Everything was absolutely beautiful and romantic. If you have never been to a 5 star/5 diamond restaurant please treat yourself if you can and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were pleased and disappointed at the same time. The service was good: people knew their stuff, and if you asked further questions they had answers.  But, our table was full of crumbs that didn't get swept up  - what's up with that?! Every course we had was delicious. Beautiful foie gras, heirloom tomato salad with a black ice dressing that was a great treat, BUT, my rib-eye was tough!!  Gristly and hard to cut and chew. Incredibly disappointing for the quality we were expecting. That's why this 5-star restaurant only rates 4 stars from us."}
{"text":"I have traveled the world and had many great meals but Kai will go down as one of the best anywhere at anytime.  The service is exceptional.  The food is creative and delicious.  The imprinting of Southwest flavors and rare products makes each offering the most creative dish I have had.  The wine selection is not the largest but it is totally complete.  Desserts were decadent and let's be frank, this new style of \"modest desserts\" is really not what we want.  

The staff is knowledgeable about the food and wine offerings and presents each dish with panache.  My girlfriend is gluten free and the staff understood that.  When they served the different bread offerings they gave her a special gluten free bread!  

The only negative might be there appears to be the sound of an air conditioning unit that comes on and off at times.

When you are finished and think that the holistic service approach is completed, waiting for you in your car is some water, chocolate and a note from your waiter.  Kai is that restaurant that you should save for special occasions but don't expect to hold others to their level of care, as you will start to be disappointed with some otherwise good restaurants.  I would give a sixth star if I could!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best dining experience I've had.  From the amazing staff and service to the delicious and beautiful food, I can see why it's the only 5-diamond rated restaurant in Arizona.  Don't get me wrong, you pay for the experience, but I believe it's worth the price (this coming from a very frugal person who tries to find discounts wherever she can).  

My husband brought me here for my birthday and from the moment we sat down, we were treated wonderfully.  We ordered the suckling pig torta as an appetizer (portions aren't huge, but extremely flavorful and definitely enough to satisfy).  The appetizer was great, as a matter of fact...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  As entrees we ordered the lobster, scallop, and shrimp over squid ink pasta with gruyere cheese on top, and the buffalo tenderloin with mushrooms.  Both were amazing.  The lobster was no doubt the best dish I've ever had.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and deliciously rich but not heavy.  The buffalo was surprisingly not gamey and had a great fresh taste without being dry for such a lean cut of meat.  

We want to go back and try one of the tastings, but for 200 per person, we may need to wait for a bigger celebration to go.  But I'm already plotting the next time I'll be back for another mind blowing experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for somewhere really fantastic to go to for a special occasion, Kai is a very good choice.  Sure, it's spendy, but if you can get past that, you'll have an awesome time and a really superb meal.

First off, you'll need to make reservations pretty well in advance.  I was lucky enough to get a table only a week out, but you should try to get a reservation at least two weeks or so in advance or else you might not get one.  If it's a good time of the year (read: not summer), make sure to request a seat outside on the patio, as it's beautiful out there.  Don't worry about getting cold if it's winter, as they have heaters outside to keep you warm.

The menu here has a wide variety of choices, and everything is really fancy and unique.  There are a few salads, a bunch of appetizers, and some really great entrees and desserts.  In addition to what you order, the wait staff brings out a bunch of different complementary things as well - fresh breads, various small things to snack on, palate cleansers, etc.  I really don't feel like I can write a review that does justice to how awesome this place is, and I'd recommend you read the Feasting in Phoenix review of Kai to get a better idea of what to expect.  It's at:

http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=213

I had never eaten at a five-diamond restaurant before this and really didn't know what to expect, but Kai was really an awesome experience and I'm very happy I went there.  They have fantastic food (the buffalo steak entree is AMAZING), great drinks, and probably the best service you'll ever have anywhere.  The view from the patio is awesome, and if you can get a reservation around the time the sun is setting, it'll be just that much better.  Just be prepared to drop a good amount of money - if each person gets a drink, an appetizer, and an entree, you'll probably very easily spend $70-100 per person.

Very, very highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here back in January and it was my best dinning experience ever. I can't think of a restaurant where I've been to where I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever! For those who know me, that means a lot coming from me.

Everything was perfect - from the moment we were greeted by the hostess to be seated to the point when we got into our car with chocolates and bottled waters waiting for us inside. The the \"high end\" restaurants in the city of Vancouver really needs to learn a thing or two from Kai. Our server was great; the ambiance was really calm; and the amazing food came with an amazing view (we were lucky to be seated in front of the window that over looked the back of the Sheraton). The dinning experience was unique with their synchronized table service and Native American fine dinning of amazing food. I can't remember the dishes of the appetizers that we had but I do remember it being amazing - mine had fois gras on it. My trio of seafood main was also amazing - the scallops and lobster were cooked perfectly. The chef gave us a complimentary dessert even though we ordered one ourselves. It's a shame that the chef's complimentary chocolate dessert wasn't on the menu because it was better than the chocolate dessert we ordered off of the menu. 

I can not say enough good things about this restaurant. I would come back to the Phoenix area just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago and the fine dining options we have in the city. KIA really impressed with their level of service from first arrival to valet having our car waiting for us with a gift of 2 water bottles ,a thank you for dining card,and 2 chocolates from the restaraunt waiting for us in the car. With those small added touches I can see why this place has some very high ratings. I didnt even get to the meal. The enjoyable part about dining here is it seems every plate comes with a historic Indian story behind it. Every plate we had was delicious and delivery timed well. The view of the mountians from our table was a plus also. I back their high marks."}
{"text":"My experience here was good as I had the chance to bring my son with me, as a graduation gift, and more so for him to see why I want the best for him and that the best requires the presence of mind, for me this means college,though as a father I accept he is an individual incarnate, that has choice, and from within he will and must make his choice.....whats this got to do with the Kai? Nothing and Everything as I connected with my son and he got it, well he had the best culinary experience, means he said oh I see what you mean about microwave food, all this aside, the presentation at Kai respects the traditions of the Native Americans, whom we as Americans owe more than I can describe in words, so if you are fortunate enough to be at this place or locale stop by and experience their expression of perfection.
Pay your respect to the culture that endured the worst we \"americans\" projected and respect the kindness and value of they that were here first. william ashton"}
{"text":"Five star all the way! Waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and listended.  Everything about the restaurant was spectacular.  The atmosphere, the elegance, the first class service.  The waiter and staff only called me by my name for introduction purposes.  I did not feel like it was overbearing at all as I read in some negative reviews.

The food, athough some of the pairings sound odd, went together really well.  I loved the foie gras and the escargot (prepared in a manner never before seen).  

The buffalo, amazing.  I actually liked it with the red wine reduction from the ribeye with the buffalo.  I asked for pepper to spice it up a bit and was brought three varieties of pepper.  They were amazing!  

Certainly a special occasion location, but so worth it and it deserves all of the positive accolades."}
{"text":"While Kai did have an interesting tasting menu featuring unique takes on native cuisine, I was disappointed overall. They had recently increased the price of their tasting menus far above what was advertised on the website (which I've noticed has since been corrected). At the their new prices -- $280 for the large tasting menu with wine -- it wasn't even close to worth it. Atlas Bistro or Quiessence were as good or better, and now, after trying Kai, seem like a bargain. 

If Kai were to offer their tasting menu at a price point closer to that of Atlas or Quiessence, I would definitely recommend them and would not hesitate to offer a four-star rating. The ambiance at Kai, similar to that of an off-strip 1970s era Vegas hotel, was marginally better than Atlas, but inferior to Quiessence. While the food at Kai was interesting, it just wasn't phenomenal enough to merit the outrageous cash outlay necessary to try it -- more than double other locally foced, chef-driven Valley restaurants.

If you're in the market for a nice, creative dinner, I'd rather recommend restaurants such as Quiessence, Atlas Bistro, FnB or Binkley's, all of which offer at least as good of an experience without requiring multiple wheelbarrows of cash to partake in phenomenally interesting and creative cuisine."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely deserves to be a 5 diamond restaurant. I'm not easily impressed when it comes to service, but I am thoroughly impressed with the service at this establishment! Starting with the choice of citrus for your FREE VOSS water (lime, lemon, or blood orange slices), the service is impeccable all the way until the end when you walk out the hotel door to find your car pulled by your valet perfectly timed for your exit! Sitting inside your car are complimentary bottles of Voss water, a hand written thank you note from your head waiter, and a box of chocolate!! WOW! To top it off, the food is amazing with all the flavors just married together perfectly in every dish!

We ordered the Short Story and made some adjustments to the menu and they were VERY accommodating!  I didn't care for the gaspacho, so I asked to replace it with the seared foie gras and was willing to pay an up-charge.  Done!  They did an app portion foie for me and it was absolutely delicious!  Spanish sea bass was cooked perfectly and just melted in my mouth.  Tenderloin of buffalo was not too gamey with just the right flavor.  All the flavors in each dish come together to perfection!  My hats off to the chef and he certainly is an upcoming Michelin star contender!!

Highly recommend this restaurant to any visitors to AZ as well as residents!  A must have experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing. We did the short story tasting menu with wine.
Everything was beyond excellent with the exception of the dessert.
The cake portion of the combination seemed to be lacking in flavor.
However, each course, from the soup on was perfect. All the dishes and utensils were at the correct temperature to be served with the course. Service was impeccable. 
The wine parings were exceptional.
Very pricey, but you get what you pay for. Awesome view and room as well."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! The service and food are one of a kind! The use of fresh local ingredients are spectacular! Make reservations right before the sunset restaurant has an amazing view! I have visited many top notch restaurants with amazing chefs but none compare to Kai! The lobster dish was to die for just the right amount of butter.  Mushrooms with goat cheese and escargot simply amazing! Words won't do the food any justice! Just go and enjoy you Will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! wow! Wow! I understand why you are a Triple A Five Diamond Reward and voted as Forbes Five Star Award restaurant...not only are you very crafty, creative and detailed with your culinary dishes but also your attention to art and how you integrated it with the atmosphere and whole dining experience. This place has all the feel of being..Native American? Well it is on a Indian Reserve....but it's like really fancy Native American decor...they have different paintings for each menu...and the waiter told us that it changes every time so even when you go back you'll see a different painting on the menu. The menu is also cleverly named too...instead of appetizer, small bites, and entree...they replaced it with \"the birth\", \"the beginning\" and \"the journey\" each corresponding to the amount of food each one serves. I'm giving it 4 stars for the atmosphere alone. =)  

My bf made reservations at this place for 5:45pm but we were stuck in traffic for a while and my bf gave them a call telling them we would be a little late..this place is located in a far off resort and spa of Wild Horse Pass..not that easy to find but it's really nice and quiet around this area in Chandler.

When we arrived the hostess referred to us as Mr. and Mrs. Li....I was about to correct her but my bf thought it would be funny just to say yes..haha so the whole night they just referred to us as Mr. Li or Mrs. Li..  Oi one thing I notice throughout the whole night is that -- there are NO YOUNG people here....my bf and I were the youngest couple here....other people were at least 40 and above. This is a pricey restaurant.....but why no young people here on Friday night? I guess they rather spend $$$$ at clubs or something..hehe maybe not just saying.

Well let's get on with the food review, shall we? They served us three selections of some pretty good breads and olive oil to start off with..then they gave us each a tablespoon of chef's special dumplings with toasted parsley and after that we got Guava sherbet with Pomegranate Reduction....DELISH! After all the little complimentary foods, we finally got to order...

 They do have a tasting menu but that's not what we tried this time...instead we started off with a Lobster, Pumpkin & Mesquite Grilled Squash Bisque...it was not only yummy but so cool! they bring out a plate with lobster, avocado and pepita seeds arranged below a swirl of meringue..then they set it on fire with a small torch to toast the meringue then putting off the fire by pouring in the bisque! haha that's was really cool. 

For entree, I had the juicy, tender and super flavorful Red Deer Venison Loin with Sage infused Gnocchi....usually not a fan of gnocchi but they made it really tasty! My bf had their most famous dish...Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo...I really love the Sweet Corn Puree on this dish...the buffalo meat was also very tender and flavorful...both meats were pretty much melt in your mouth goodness.

Then for dessert we had the interesting Creme Brulee Cones....there were three Saguaro Seed Cones filled with different flavors of brulee in each...sweet corn, sweet vanilla and winter squash pudding. Topped with strawberry cotton candy that was sprinkled with chili. Very interesting....but I was not very fond of the sweet corn one...the others were really good.

The service was pretty good too, although what impressed me was at the end when my bf and I were walking out the hostess greeted us goodnight and said the waiter would like to further thank you for dining with us tonight...and handed us a card and little nicely wrapped bag of truffle and chocolate strawberry. I was like wow...that's really nice of them to actually write a thank you card! haha 

This place is definitely great for special occasions or when you feel like really splurging! but like I said we were the youngest couple this night...and I honestly don't think they see too many people in their 20's here.....

Overall I had a wonderful evening at this restaurant and hope to come here again and try out their tasting menu =)"}
{"text":"Where to begin with Kai? I just had the most amazing date there. That was really special since my date was super thoughtful, he made sure that the place was both beautiful and they were very accommodating when it came to special diets. I know right!? Anyway, every course was absolutely dreamy! It was an experience from the start. If I could, I'd give Kai 10 starts. We ended the night with a couple of glasses of Pinot from central CA. I will definitely return, not just for the appetizers, nor the wine but the beautiful view!"}
{"text":"From the minute you are seated you are transported to a culinary experience that changes your life. You learn about the history of the Native American cuisine of the region by a wonderful educated server. 

My husband and I shared a primary course of Arctic Char cooked perfectly with a seared crust and moist inside. Accompanied with native beans and corn in a wonderful sauce. 
We then inhaled the lobster cooked three ways. Poached in butter, as part of a salad with a vanilla vinaigrette, and as part of a flan with buttered breadcrumbs.
Next was the Lamb tenderloin wrapped in pecans enhanced by a mole sauce and squash accompaniment. The Buffalo tenderloin was perfection offset by a corn purée and smoky mushroom flavor.
Native breads were served to round out the flavors.
No over the top molecular gastronomy here just chefs who passionately bring you to a land  indicative of the region they love.
Don't miss this experience in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came here for our 30th anniversary celebration.  The service was phenomenal.  Kudos to Jeremy, Darren, and Robert. However, the food was a bit of a disappointment.  Both the escargot and scallops were gritty, like you were chewing on sand.  Not at all appetizing.  The Buffalo filet itself was very good, however, the accouterment had an overly smoked flavor to it and was so overly salty it was inedible. For the price you pay, i expected a bit better."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a 10 star I would! Kai is mind blowing amazing! It is awe inspiring! The ambiance is magnificent! The service is out of this world impressive! I have been to many fine dining restaurants throughout the country, however I have to  express this one was by far extraordinary and it surpassed them all! The presentation, the aroma, the savoriness of the food is majestic and simply remarkable! From the minute you step into the bar area it is luxurious and you are treated like royalty, all the way to the time you are back to your car at the valet.  
I absolutely appreciated and loved the courtesy as well as the respectfulness of the staff.
I absolutely recommend Kai restaurant to anyone who is looking for an outstanding restaurant."}
{"text":"It's our favorite place in earth! We have been there 3 times and it just gets better. It's a bit far and of course, expensive but you get more than you expect for your money. I have dinned in Vegas for 850 bucks, did not get the same experience I have had at Kai, neither the great food."}
{"text":"Take someone that matters here and you won't be sorry. The service is some of the best in the world, and the food is stunning. The menu changes once or twice a year, and if you can't wrangle this place on an expense account, it is THE place to impress a client. Destined for a Michelin star...."}
{"text":"We tried the 13 course tasting menu with extended wine selection. The service was wonderful and 100% spot on.

The food however, was quite a let down. Some dishes really excelled in their taste and presentation, while many were just a puzzling question mark followed by a mediocre taste. 

A few memories include a shot of squeezed juice which is considered a course which is more suited as a canape. 

A salad which included a few leafs of lettuce with two small slivers of cheese. I appreciated the craftsmanship of the 30 year old cheese, but it in no way complimented the lettuce and left you wondering why it wasn't paired with something more suitable or to paraphrase, enjoyable.

Out of the 13 courses, there were 3 or 4 that really shined.. the buffalo being one of these. 

When you average in the odd interior decor it's apparent that attention has not been paid to all the details.. and that's what a fine dining experience really should include. If you're aiming for multi-michelin star experience, detail detail detail. 

On another high note, the wine pairings were absolutely wonderful and the sommelier was both informative and wonderful in not only introducing each pairing, but being able to provide excellent alternatives when pairings didn't go quite well.

The card which gave us a list of all the courses + pairings was a nice touch at the end.

For Arizona this is a step up in experience and i'm happy to see restaurants of such caliber really offering alternatives to places such as Binkley's.

It's worth trying, but for us there weren't many dishes we'd be craving on a return visit for. 

After reading other reviews, it may be an issue that Kai has invested a good amount of time in perfecting the smaller tasting menus and main entrees but struggled to fill the larger 13 plate experience."}
{"text":"It's so hard to say a restraurant is amazing when the hype has been built up so much. It dares you to be disappointed. I am still not sure (a month later) which camp I fall into. I've heard such amazing things about Kai from so many people in the Valley - friends, husband, co-workers, clients. All of those amazing things people have told me are true. The service, drinks, dinner, dessert - they were all amazing. I guess I'm disappointed because they didn't stand out in their amazingness. Does that even make sense? I'll try to explain. 

For example, the ambience & decor are top notch. Soft music, luxurious & spacious dining room, hip bar - but the place just feels like, I don't know, like it's missing its soul. Kai just feels & looks like another great Arizona restraurant. It's subtly southwest, but you could be at the Camelback Inn or the Pointe. You don't get the feeling you're at a Casino (although that's actually down the street, huh?) or on an Indian reservation - you could be in North Scottsdale or Downtown Phoenix. I don't know, something was just missing. It's hard for me to describe or even put my finger on. Look at their virtual tour & see if you agee.

Kai does better in the actual food & menu - it's pretty clear that organic farming & using good quality ingredients from the Gila River Indian Community are a cornerstone of the menu - it's written in every description. Our party enjoyed both surf & turf - so we had a good representation off the menu with appetizers & desserts. Every entree was wonderful & there were no leftovers! But, again, I was left feeling......something, what? The dishes were inspired by Native American culture, but in the end - I couldn't really tell the difference between the \"inspired\" tenderloin & one from Durant's or Mastro's. The difference between the local micro green salad & one grown in California. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the dishes were more authentic to Arizona's various Native American tribes. Taking a real tribal staple or favorite dish & then giving it an amazing executive chef's touch or re-inventing it - that to me would truely make Kai unique. Serving lobster, dry aged rib eye, truffles, & scallops just sounds like every other expensive, five star restraurant in the Valley & probably in any large US city. What's uniquely Native American or Arizonan about that?

Some ideas - maybe if they changed the decor, hired an Arizonan Native American chef, created an avant garde signature dish from a tribal staple, or gave your party a handmade arts & craft talisman made by the local tribes instead of a hand written Thank you on stationary?? I don't know. I think Kai just needs to be more innovative & create a dining experience that a local or visitor can't get at any other restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. Take themselves out of the five star restaurant competition by giving the guest something completely different & cutting edge.

In short, I think Kai is just missing that 'je ne sais quoi'. After all the great reviews & hype, I felt Kai fell short. I was expecting an authentic, uniquely Arizonan Native American dining experience & got an amazing, delicious dinner at a five star restraurant. Great dinner, but not really unique or innovative."}
{"text":"Excellent service, beautiful display of food and very tasty.  Love the cultural background of the history of Native American influence. Staff was definitely the 5 star service as stated.  Friends had the salmon or white fish, and I had a New York Strip.  It was a little tough and they replaced with a reorder, then no charge on that because it took so long. Gave us desserts and just so accommodating.  Wine steward was knowledgeable but young, which was o.k. Highly, highly recommend it.  The hotel is going through renovation so the \"view\" of the mountains was covered up by drapes, so you feel a little bit in the closet, but the service made it worthwhile and food.  Remodel is just temporary and will be magnificent soon."}
{"text":"Kai deserves its reputation as one of the 10 best restaurants in America.  I dined in a 2 Michelin star restaurant in New York City last week and Kai's was far superior."}
{"text":"Great Food and even Better Service

Staff made sure that all entrees were placed simultaneously in front of everybody.  My wife claims that the service seemed choreographed.  Never had service quite like this.....

Food was also exotic.  A few things touched my palate for the first time while dining here....inspired by some local native american herbs which typically aren't found in the grocery store.    

Great for a romantic night out or splurge of some type."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a dinner reservation at Kai for my birthday.First off the service was among the finest we have experienced.  Extremely well - trained and - versed on the components of each dish.  We started with a small tuna plate and bread serviced complimentary with dinner.  The tuna was of excellent grade with a favorable but not overpowering sauce.  Bread was good except a small piece of course native bread that tasted like a hard whole grain dumpling.  We each ordered a salad mine was mainly beets and fermented earth.  Different but tasty.  My husband's salad was mainly tomato aspect with greens and cheese.  The chef was kind enough to forgo the olives and mushrooms.  After the salad we were provided a small sorbet, perfect is the only word.  For my main, I had the scallops which were cooked medium just to my liking.  I did not care for the curry sauce on the pasta.  Just my taste buds.  My husband ordered the lamb and liked everything on the plate except the lamb as it was overcooked and slightly tough.  The ending was nothing short of spectacular.  I was provided a beet chocolate raspberry desert, yum.  Afterwards we has a few chocolates and a dry ice herb show.  The best restaurant in the valley for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review.  I did a lot of research and came up with the idea to go to Kai for my boyfriend's and my two year anniversary, based on all the excellent reviews.  We love good food.  We ended up at Kai recently, and I have to say, we were extremely let down.  I was disappointed enough to write my first restaurant review!

We found the atmosphere to be what you would expect at any mediocre hotel buffet.  The food was definitely good, but we were not blown away.  

My boyfriend ordered the Journey with wine pairings, while I attempted to order the Short Story with wine pairings (I can't eat that many courses!).  The waiter told us we couldn't do that, and he seemed annoyed with the request.  After much discussion, he ended up just bringing me some of the courses off the Journey menu.  The interaction with him always seemed awkward, and the experience was very uncomfortable.

After dropping $600 on this meal (with wine, tip and tax), we were in awe.  Yes, the food here is good.  The wine pairings were well done.  However, for that kind of money, I've had MUCH better experiences (food, service, and ambiance) at Binkley's, Quiessence, Atlas, and Noca.  Wait, I've had better experiences at these restaurants for 1/3 to 1/2 the price.

I honestly don't understand all the amazing reviews of this place.  No one seemed to know our names.  The one time our awkward waiter called me using a last name, it was my boyfriend's (we aren't married).  No one else knew our names.  We did not receive any kind of chocolates or thank-you card even though we stayed at the resort.  

I really wish I had loved Kai as much as all these other reviewers.  I had really been looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I came to the Sheraton Wildpass for a conference and came across this beautiful restaurant - Kai.   The service at this restaurant was quite incredible.  The servers were so in sync with each other with the plates placements and all other services, it was actually pretty fun to watch!

I had the best Ribeye steak here - it was done just right and the meat just melted in my mouth.  I devoured the entire 16 oz of it without thinking much about all the calories.  It was done just right and I never really experience that much anywhere else.  

I also had the chocolate three ways for dessert and I actually was a bit disappointed with this.  The shake didn't taste too good and not much chocolate tastes in it.  The cake in the middle was kind of hard.

In summary - A nice restaurant and well decor that serves a killer steak."}
{"text":"Read the reviews as they are the truth. 

So much has been written about Kai that i cannot make it sound much better , so ill do a simple rundown. 

Service - A + And I'm talking about the French Room in Dallas A+. Not anything you would find in Scottsdale (unfortunately) or similar \"classy\" cities.

Food - Again A + in the way you would want coursed meal to look, taste and be presented.

Quality / Cost - Worth every penny, and the card, champagne plus chocolates sent by the chef waiting for us in our room after the completion of dinner was what has won me over and set Kai apart. 

Ps. This is after multiple visits, which is in itself amazing to have ZERO drop off in any of the category's."}
{"text":"This place is really great. Yes, it is expensive.  But seriously worth it. 
Multiple servers sweep around you to deliver your dishes. You get frozen forks and knives with your apps, warm ones with your entrees, and one of each with your dessert.  
When you sit down you get water with your choice of cherries/lemon/cucumber. Then really great bread. Everything is delivered so elegantly. I have never had better service anywhere. 
As for food, I had the tart appetizer. It was a little weird.  There was a balsamic ice on it.  Interesting, but not my favorite thing. I had the elk for dinner.  Wow.  So good. I think it is one of the best entrees that I have ever had. So amazing.  Husband has the buffalo.  Also awesome. We were nervous about getting game, but I am so glad we did. So good. 

Also, this place really does a lot of nice extras. There was a sweet bread amuse, a sorbet palate cleanser, and truffles when we were done. Also, they recognize that Phoenix water is gross and their table water is really nice bottled water. PLus, the view is stunning.  It would be awesome to sit outside in the winter.  

Overall, if you are looking for a nice, unique special dinner, this place is really a great place to go. Really a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Perfect...all the way around. Service...food. ..just everything. We left sooooo full after the 6 course meal. I want to say more but don't want to ruin the surprise"}
{"text":"Atmosphere romantic, very attentive waiters, staff very knowledgeable and told story's about the foods. We started with a amuse - which was wagu beef tartar, then had salad \" from the gardens\", followed by lobster three ways with Indian fry bread, blueberry mango sorbet, tribal buffalo and del chocolate soufflés for desert. The food was excellent. Yes it was pricy, but worth it. Especially for a special occasion. We went for our Anniversery. Definitely recommend to foodies"}
{"text":"A very unique dining experience in Phoenix and in fact anywhere in the US since Kai serves upscale Native American cuisine.  The dining room was nice, but nothing spectacular.  The service was quite good and I enjoyed how they explained the stories behind the artwork on the menus (65 different scenes, by the way).  The food was quite tasty, but somewhat overpriced, in my opinion.  Again, unique experience, but not sure we would ever go back based on price."}
{"text":"Kai, meaning seed in a Native American language, is a top tier fine dining restaurant. It resides inside, get this, a Sheraton. The entire dining experience feels like sitting down at a cozy fireplace for an epic retelling of some story, similar to the recent Clash of Clans advertisement with James Corden and lava pups.

The waiter had all of us hold our menus with the fronts facing the center of the table. The fronts of the menus each had different water color art, and each visual told a different story. At one point I exclaimed, \"Well, I had a bean burrito for lunch,\" which caused everyone, including the waiter, to giggle a bit. The whole thing was a bit over the top for my taste, but I can tell why they do it.

I had the Short Story tasting menu, which I can tell you, is not short at all. The entire meal was about 2.5 hours for the seven courses. My group had an uni (sea urchin) allergy, Portobello mushroom allergy, and of course, I'm vegetarian. The restaurant had no problem adjusting the tasting menu.

The \"Hand Picked Lettuces\" (tomato eggplant salad) was remarkably well presented - the greens looked as if they were sprouting from the tomato eggplant base. The \"From The Garden\" (beets, asparagus, etc.) was quite the mix of interesting colors. I felt like I was eating art.

My favorite dish was the main course. Meant to be a buffalo entrée, the chef took out the buffalo and made a convincing equivalent with quinoa. I was a bit concerned when I first heard his plan. I once did the tasting menu at Bluestem in Kansas City where they just replaced the meat with grilled vegetables for a vegetarian friend, and we were both disappointed. But Kai did no such thing. 

Be wary of eating too much bread here. The course portions were enough to make me full, but Kai had nearly ten kinds of bread available for tasting that night. I guess there is such a thing as too much good food.

At one point our group took a picture next to a memory catcher, or dream weaver, or some kind of Native American art that the waiter explained was only one of three in the world, with one of the others being in a museum. He noted that a woman previously had snagged her bag on it, causing it to collapse and have to be remade. Naturally, a person in our group had his sweater snagged onto it while taking the photo. Listen, it's not just dreams and memories that this thing was designed to grab a hold of.

The service at Kai was other-worldly. The presentation was fantastic - it's not every day I have a meal where six waiters with a plate each come out at the same time. I guess it's standard for the price. But Kai is the kind of restaurant that has the valet leave bottled water, chocolate, and a hand written thank you card in your vehicle. AND I DIDN'T HAVE CASH FOR A TIP. Probably my most embarrassing moment of 2016 YTD.

If I'm in the Phoenix area and have the time and money to come back, I will. Kai is so out of the way, but if you're looking for a food journey (or short story) in Arizona, Kai is the right place."}
{"text":"Unparalleled dining experience in Arizona. This is one of the best places we have dined worldwide and we are proud to have Kai in our home state.

We did the Chef's tasting course with wine pairing and everything was impeccable from start to finish. The chef creates complex, refined, and elegant dishes. The presentation is both beautiful and meaningful. The service was perfection. All together, they do a magnificent job of telling the story of Native American culture. That's all I will say because you should go see for yourself... you will not be disappointed! 

If you are in search of a truly amazing culinary experience, this is an absolute must.

Thank you Chef Swanson, Austin, Kevin, Jeremy, and the rest of the team!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Kai. Yes, it is expensive. But, the experience is so worth it! I had the Short Story, which is the 7-course meal.  

Amuse - I couldn't tell you what this was, but it was tasty. It had a piece of asparagus with nuts.
Mesquite Ha:l Soup - The presentation is beautiful. The cotton candy gets melted right in front of you with the soup.
Three Sisters - The scallop was cooked perfectly.
Intermezzo - The sorbet was refreshing.
Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo - The tenderloin was fork tender. The smoked corn puree was delicious and the chorizo was on another level.   
Global Artisan Cheese - I had two cheeses. One was mild, can't remember the name and the other was a type of blue cheese. I enjoyed them with some honey and crackers.
Dessert - The dessert was sorbet and too pretty to eat. Of course, I ate it all.

This was the best culinary experience of my life. Everything was perfect! I felt like I was a judge on Iron Chef America. The presentation was beautiful. Yes, the food is different, because it's not a steakhouse. So, you have to be open to eating locally farmed ingredients and Native American inspired dishes. The menu is showcased on a piece of Mesquite with a watercolor painting from a local Native American artist. The view of the sunset was breathtaking.     

The service was excellent. They push in your chair and place the napkin on your lap. We never had to wait for a refill. The service explains every course to you. Jackson was our server and he was great! He even walked me out of the restaurant to show me the restroom. At the end of our meal, they gave us four chocolate truffles. And, a handwritten \"thank you\" card from Jackson. If you are tired of going to steakhouses and feel adventurous, this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"Stop reading this review, pick up the phone, and make a reservation for dinner.  You HAVE to experience this for yourself.  NOTHING I can write nor words can explain the superior level of service you will receive along with the amazing food you will eat.  My 2nd visit to Kai was in December of 2014 and they remembered (from my first visit a month prior) that I had requested almond milk for my coffee because of my dietary restriction.  Their chef literally made the almond milk from scratch by hand that night.  Fast forward ONE YEAR LATER to my dinner there last night with two of my best girlfriends and co-workers.  I ordered my coffee and without asking, they delivered a creamer containing coconut cream (which is a secondary option for my diet) and actually my preferred coffee creamer.  You just can't get that kind of attention to detail anywhere else!  Their staff works in unison like an amazing flock of birds, and the food is prepared to perfection.  They will make you feel like family, which makes you choose them each and every time for your next, and next, and next elegant dining experiences.  Thank you Kai for another incredible evening.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"5 BIG STARS

For service and quality of meal, restaurants really don't get any better than this. Multiple servers, dressed in NY black are constantly there for you.

This restaurant prides itself in using local products & blending them into traditional meals, ala Alice Waters, and they do an excellent job.

For starters, we had (are you ready?):
-\"Macerated Local Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomatoes, Fossil Creek Goat Cheese & Mascarpone Tart,\" including Buckwheat & Saguaro Seed Tart, Basil foamed from the garden, Black Ice, and Gila River Olive Oil; and
-\"Pan Flashed White & Green Asparagus with Chanterelles & Cholla Buds,\" including Chanterelle Mushroom Fondue, Desert Quail Egg (sunny side up), Red Currents and Aged Sherry.

And that was just the beginning! For dinner we had:
-\"Veal Ribeye Rubbed with Sandalwood, Dry Mole & Green Chile Sand,\" including Mesquite Cooked Desert Fruit Chutney, Truffle Frites, and Rutabaga Cobbler; and
-\"Local Pecan Crusted Colorado Lamb with Native Seeds SEARCH Mole,\" including Pastry Tapenade of Fennel, QC Olives, Eggplant, Wild Mushrooms, Heirloom Tomatoes & Iitoi Onions.

Everything was exquisite!

This meal was to die for!

Any complaints at all? Well, yes, but very minor. This place is actually in a Sheraton, but I guess that insures a good stream of patrons that can afford such meals.

And the decor? Not very good. It needs a serious MAKEOVER.  Wall-hangings, window treatments & carpeting aren't much.

So there you are..."}
{"text":"This is a 7 STAR REVIEW. Here is the real, honest to goodness truth. I've done tons of reviews. I've given some 5 stars before. Now that I've been to Kai, I literally feel that I need to go back and move all others down a full star. Kai is by far, that good and the absolute best food and experience I've ever had. It's simply not fair to put other 5 star Yelp reviews on par with this restaurant. I'm a food lover, a dining experience lover. Honestly, I kind of prefer the hole-in-the-wall places, mom and pop, casual. Kai may have changed me,...no, it did change me. I have a new appreciation for restaurants like this. It was beyond tremendous. I truly believe it may have ruined me on other \"really nice\" restaurants. I would hate to be the next \"really nice\" restaurant I go to because there is absolutely no-way it will measure up to Kai.

Bottom line, this was the best \"dining experience\" of my life. And I've been to some nice places in some pretty cool countries. Why?

Service: absolutely impeccable. All plates served and cleared at the same time. Silverware heated/chilled to appropriate temperature for your next dish. Sommelier was spot on, picked the exact wine I described we'd like that night, absolutely perfect.

Wait staff: friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, polite, timely, genuine. Best I've ever had, ever, anywhere, hands down. 

Food: Carefully, lovingly prepared by what are clearly experts, with the absolute best, freshest, highest quality ingredients in the perfect amounts. Best tasting, robust, full, absolutely incredible. We were worried portion sizes would be small. Worried for nothing, we were stuffed, perfect!

Atmosphere: peaceful, comfortable, soft, warm, comforting, soft music, lots of space, clean. Simply unreal

Value: honestly, for the service, quality, quantity and the entire experience, this is the best value there is, worth every penny and not excessively priced. I've had much less for much more money.

No kidding, if I could afford to eat here EVERY NIGHT, hands down, I would do it.

I honestly wish there was a 6 star option,...or 7. This is just like the Tesla Model S P85D breaking the Consumer Reports Rating Scale. It only goes to 100 and the car scored 103. That is Kai, better than the best.

If you have to forego 5 restaurants to save to go to Kai, do it! Don't miss this restaurant, whatever you do."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 50th birthday here and am still reeling over the experience! The service and ambience were fantastic but the food was the star! We each did the short story tasting menu and LOVED everything that was placed before us! Pricey yes, but well worth the experience and isn't that what life is all about!"}
{"text":"Kai, an upscale eatery with Native American influences, would be a worthy splurge for the historical and cultural education alone.  Add in delicious food complete with unexpected surprises, perfectly orchestrated service and personal touches, and I can see why it's regarded at one of the Phoenix area's best restaurants.

We started out meal by sampling the signature cocktails.  I loved the emphasis on local flavors:
1. Mequite Bean ($14) - with Maker's Mark, mesquite bean syrup, lime, sweet vermouth and grapefruit juice, this cocktail was exotic but still very delicious.  I liked the mesquite bean pod garnish, which acted like a fun swizzle stick
2. Skocu Thu ($14) - a great drink if you lament your tendency to toss back cocktails with alarming speed.  The drink name translates to \"The Hot Stuff\", a well earned title if you ask me.  The pleasant burn, from ancho chili infused lemon vodka, will help ensure that you sip this drink.  The supporting cast of ingredients included lemon juice, lemoncello and a dried pepper garnish

The menu is split into The Birth, The Beginning and The Journey, which was can be roughly translated to appetizer, slightly larger second appetizer and entree.  Rather than order a Journey, I chose to try two births and one beginning, which was actually quite a lot of food.  You'll want to keep that in mind when you order:
1. Carrot Cake (Amuse) - I really liked this little cube of carrot cake and delicious sauces
2. Lobster, Pumpkin & Mesquite Grilled Squash Bisque ($15) - the bisque arrived as a round cylinder of lobster meat, pepita seeds and avocado topped with a plump little marshmallow.  The marshmallow was then drizzled with sambuca and set aflame.  After a few moments of awesome blue fire (accompanied by my frenzied photography), the fire was put out by the square bisque.  The marshmallow, albeit unexpected, pair surprisingly well with the naturally sweet lobster and I really enjoyed the large serving of delicious bisque
3. Lychee Sorbet with Rose Syrup (Palate Cleanser) - an tiny scoop of lychee sorbet with rose syrup in an exquisite tiny bowl.  I had no idea lychee and rose were so wonderful together!
4. Open Faced Pheasant Machaca on a Saffron Pasta Ribbon ($20) - they may not be Native American, but I'm a total sucker for truffles, and I was delighted with the winter truffle shavings scattered on this dish.  The presentation was very appealing on top of a big rectangle of pasta with tender pheasant and bits of raisin chutney and pear
5. Escargot, Truffle, Wild Mushrooms & Caramel Goat Cheese ($24) - truffle + mushrooms + escargot?  Yeah, there was just no resistance in sight!  Absolutely exquisite preparation of escargot and mushrooms and the native toast with truffle crema in the middle and the pork belly nuggets were delightful!
6. Fry Bread - we raved about our love of fry bread and our waiter was kind enough to let us sample Kai's Fry Bread, which typically accompanies the Lobster Degustation.  Small and lighter than traditional fry bread, these reminded my of the fried buns that accompany chili crab in Singapore
7. Blue Bird Fry Bread Donuts ($13) - despite being nearly uncomfotably full, we were unable to resist the allure of more fry bread, and truthfully, I cannot find it in myself to regret ordering this dessert.  The 5 small donuts were accompanied by spiced chocolate dip as well as a tiny doll-sized mug of Eggnog cream.  Eggnog cream + cinnamon sugar fry bread donuts = ecstasy in the making!  Wow!
8. Dulce de Leche Chocolates - when these small, only slightly larger than marbles, chocolates arrived at the table, we threw in the towel and asked for a to-go box.  There was absolutely no room!

As an amazingly cool gesture, our waiter arranged to place a hand-written card and box of chocolates in our car.  How incredible is that!  A+ service!!!

PARTING THOUGHT: Be sure to check out the collection of watercolor art in the menus and ask about the decor.  A lot of thought went into ensuring that the restaurant ambiance would reflect true Native American culture!"}
{"text":"Two words that you'd never expect in the same sentence.  However that is what await you at Kai.  Native American And French cuisine, two cultures you don't expect together, but the chef at Kai blends these two types of cuisine beautifully.  Located in the dazzling Wild Horse Pass, this is a perfect blend of Native American and French cuisine.   The 7 course meal called the \"short story\" started with a duck confetti on top of a reduced raspberry for the amuse.  Next came a local heirloom ripened tomato tart.  Thirdly was the freshly fileted Spanish sea bass.  The skin side was slightly seared so it was crispy.  The sauce was a mixture of lemon and orange extract on a bed of vegetables.   I'm a big fan of white fish, but the bass here I found to be a bit overcooked.  The usual flaky meat ofa white sea fish wasn't very pronounced in this dish.   Following the intermezzo which was very forgettable (because I forgot) was their signature dish, an exquisite grilled buffalo tenderloin.    The buffalo sat on top of a corn puree and beans syrup sauce.   The texture and tenderness matched some of the best filet mignon I've ever had coupled with a gaming flavor.  Before the dessert was a cheese sampler.   They paired it with a fresh honey jam.  The just right amount of sweetness of the honey complimented the fine selection of cheese.   The dessert was a cheesecake which seemed common, however the complimentary chocolate dessert was delectable.   
 
Even though the sea bass could've been better (but then again I do have high expectations :-), this place still deserves a 5 start for its amazing atmosphere and impeccable service.   Where else would they let you choose 4 different types of fruits to put in your water.  :-)  Even the menu has a southwestern painting  in the front."}
{"text":"We were well taken care of from the moment we arrived at the restaurant.  I loved how each menu was painted by a local and unique.

I enjoyed having a fresh slice of peach in my bottled water.  They have small glasses the water is served in and each time your glass gets 1/2 full the waiter comes and fills it up.  It seems they made a dozen trips just for water between my husband and I.  Very amusing.

The chef prepared vegetarian items for me that weren't even on the menu.  So delicious!!  I did have the tart as an appetizer and loved how the textures and flavors worked together.  I could eat one everyday.  The balsamic ice was great on it. The palate cleanser really stood out to my husband and I- strawberry chipotle sorbet.  Sweet but burned your tounge.  Mmm.  We did not order dessert but were brought a frozen chocolate mouse cake and truffles anyway.  Both were very good.  When we returned to our room at the resort there was a box of chocolates waiting for us as well.

Our total came to $210 for two people with one alcoholic beverage each."}
{"text":"We have been eating here a long time for birthdays and anniversaries. Food, service and dress code have always been impeccable. Now if you're dressed in anything you get in including torn jeans and a t shirt.  Our waiter kept trying to rush us the whole evening. We almost walked out and went elsewhere. Glass of house Pinot noir now $20.  We weren't asked if we wanted coffee...finally asked for the check and left. Kai has always had our car ready by time we got out the front of the hotel. There was always 2 water bottles in the cup holders and chocolate on the dash...not tonight. This highest rated restaurant in the Valley was an embarrassment. Will not be returning as the 50 minute drive no longer worth the pleasure of an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Amazing!! This restaurant did not disappoint but may put a dent in your bank account. Worth every penny. The service (thanks Kevin!) was impeccable and the food was delicious, creative (art!) and picture worthy!    You really get such a neat overall experience. We can't wait to go back for another special occasion. Tip: book ahead! It's tough to get in on a weekend."}
{"text":"We came here for our wedding anniversary and everything was absolutely breathtaking! From the food, to the view, and the service, there is no other place like this, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Crazy good! I'm pretty sure you can not get food like this anywhere else in the world, at least not prepared and served as well. But let's start with the bartender. Not normally something I write about, we were just waiting for our table since we were a little early for our reservation. My wife was pregnant so couldn't have alcohol, but really missed getting fun drinks at the bar. The bartender took care of that, Jade I think her name was, not sure, but she was awesome! Amazing drinks with flavors I have never tasted before. My wife was floored that she could experience a good drink with no alcohol. The bartender also gave us free samples of special drinks. I would go to Kai just for the bar, but then I'd know the good food I'm missing out on in the next room. The coolest part for me was the incorporation of native seeds, and the whole seed saver thing. I actually liked all the seeds incorporated with my food, really gave it a unique flavor and texture that I still remember. Just get ready to spend a lot of cash, but hey how many times can you have native Arizona gourmet food?"}
{"text":"Five star all the way ! Not only was it a visual experience my taste buds were blown away. BRAVO!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Attentive waiters. Also very knowledgeable about the menu. Intriguing adaptations using desert ingredients."}
{"text":"This is a belated review for a meal that took place in late January, so some of the details will be a little sketchy, but I actually made my 4-star determination that night, so that much at least is accurate. :)

SERVICE: The reservation desk was very patient with my repeated phone calls to change our meal time (maybe because we were guests at the resort). We ended up with an 8:30 seating for six, and were seated promptly. It took a long while (10 minutes?) to get bread, water, or menus. Once the captain came with the menus, he had to give us a long speech about the artwork on the fronts of the menus. It was interesting, but at that point, we mostly just wanted to read them and order. Overall, the 

 There was a strange moment when the captain plus 5 waiters descended simultaneously, each taking a position behind one of us; it was impressive, but perhaps not the way they intended--it felt a bit like we were about to have sacks pulled over our heads & we'd wake up an hour later in the back of a van. Fortunately, they simply presented us each with our napkin. 

WINE: Sommelier was a little standoffish and not overwhelmingly helpful. List is weird. Strikes me as the list of a young restaurant that bought a bunch of stuff right before the economy crashed, so there's not much that they've had a chance to cellar and some of the prices are just out of line. There were some decent wines in the \"not insanely priced\" range (hard to do much with 3x markup), but I'm fairly certain one of the bottles I ordered was mis-priced on the wine list, because it showed up a much higher price on the bill. To their credit, they honored the wine list price without a fuss. There were some terrible choices/values on the list, such as '05 Lascombes for $300 (really not ready, plus I've seen it retail for as little as $50/bottle!).

FOOD: With six people doing 3 courses, I can't remember it all in detail over two months later, but some highlights from my memory: squash soup (poured from a carafe into a bowl containing a mound of house-made cotton candy), charcuterie plate (which included a slice of bellota ham... decadent!), bison tartare, lamb loin. My entree was the veal ribeye and it was a disaster; I can't believe a self-respecting chef would serve such a poorly prepared fat blob. I probably should've sent it back, but I was too busy keeping an eye on two of my fellow diners, who had been busy at the bar for an hour or so before the meal. Two of our party toddled off after the entree, but three survivors tackled dessert with me, and the slightly spicy mexican chocolate souffle was a revelation.

ATMOSPHERE: It was a full room when we arrived, and there were a number of moon-eyed couples and a few families. If there was anyone obnoxious that night, I'm afraid it might have been us. :-/

SUMMARY: I'm glad I ate at Kai. It has potential, and there's some interesting stuff going on in the kitchen, including use of local and indigenous ingredients. However, from my experience, the misses in food and service kept Kai short of greatness."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to begin with our experience here.  Everything was amazing, I don't have any complaints.  To the food, the service, the ambiance - it was all perfect.

There were 4 of us dining and we had 4 waiters serving us.  The finesse, precision, and attention from all of the waitstaff was beyond anything that I had ever experienced.

All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  I had the lamb entree which was prepared with a Mexican mole sauce.  Very tasty.  The others at my table are all picky eaters, but they enjoyed their meals as well (seafood pasta, buffalo, and red snapper).  We ended the meal with a delicious chocolate lava cake.  The menu changes based on what's in season.  The dishes are prepared with all local ingredients from local farms and areas.

When I returned to my room that night at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass there was a box of chocolates and a thank you note waiting for me from our waiter.  Talk about attention to detail.

I can't wait to come back and have another wonderful and memorable experience at Kai."}
{"text":"It truly is as good as it gets here.

Honestly.

The servers sweep the floor.
The food is perfection
The ambiance is classy without being pretentious
They value and carry forth many native customs, foods, etc

I love Kai.  I think it's well worth the money.
It's more than dinner, it's an experience!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel it is hard for a restaurant to meet up with standards that are set so high.  Kai was just named by OpenTable (FWTW) as one of the top 100 restaurants in the USA.  I've been to Kai a couple times since it open, but it still exceeds expectations on food, service and experience.

From the moment you arrive, the staff takes care to bring you along the journey with every attention looked over.  The view of sunset against the mountains sets the stage for food that is just incredible.  Plus their vodka selection might be the best in the Southwest.

When you want to have a special meal for special people, Kai is worth every penny and will be an experience everyone will remember."}
{"text":"Oh my.... this is my favorite restaurant in the world. I can't even put into words how good this experience was. I got two drinks, both out of this world. The first was the grapefruit martini which I'm not a huge grapefruit person and I loved it. The other one I got was the blue mountain. Then they brought us one to share that is their favorite and it was strong and good :) then I did the journey. Wow just wow. I can't explain how amazing of an experience this was. Not one ounce of regret in my mind even when getting the bill. They know what they are doing. They pay attention to everything. They know when you are remotely low on water. They escort you to the bathroom. We got to know each other Pretty well from doing the journey. It was bittersweet leaving st the end. Amazing experience please try if you ever have the opportunity!!!! You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"The tasting menu at Kai is a journey not worth missing. 

Kai is located at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort. It's a short drive from Phoenix & Scottsdale. Valet out in front. Enter, turn left and make your way towards the restaurant.

Look up the times for sunset and book a table about one hour before sunset. Trust me. 

Kai gets its inspiration from its roots in Native American cuisine, particularly of the indigenous Pima and Maricopa tribes. I couldn't say I've truly experienced Native American cuisine, which was why I was inspired to come here. 

The service is spectacular. My servers that night had ties to the Pima and Maricopa tribes, so this was more than a job to them and it showed. There was a pride in communicating about their heritage. I noticed that from the moment the menu arrived; the artwork was done by a Native American. 

The menu is different here. The usual headings of Appetizers, Entrees, and Desserts have been replaced with more powerful terms: The Birth, The Beginning, The Journey, and The Afterlife. In addition, there are two tasting menus: Short Story ($120 per person/$195 with wine pairing) and the longer Journey ($200 per person/$300 with wine pairing). This was my first foray into Native American cuisine; I chose the Journey. 

The Journey: 

- AMUSE
- LOBSTER, PUMPKIN & MESQUITE GRILLED SQUASH BISQUE (with Tian of Lobster, Avocado and Pepita Seeds with Spiced Aji Amarillo Burnt Marshmellows) 
- HAND PICKED LETTUCES
- SOUS VIDE COOL WEATHER ROOTS (Heirloom Tomatoes, Cabrales Cheese Marbles, Micro Snips, Young Beets, Macerated Mushrooms, Coconut Ginger Foam, and Spanish bleu cheese)
- FOIE GRAS IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR (Hudson Valley Foie Gras with sweet potato puree and black truffles)
- ELIXIR
- SEAFOOD POTPOURRI (of Butter Based Lobster, Guaymas Shrimp & Diver Scallops with Black Threads of Pasta, Braised Heirloom Tomatoes, Cauliflower & Leek Butter, Shaved Aged Gruyere Cheese, Ham Hock Bits, and Crisp Shallots)
- CELEBRATION OF MUSHROOM (White & Brown Beech, Morel, and Porcini)
- ESCARGOT, WILD MUSHROOM & CARAMEL GOAT CHEESE (Native Toast with Truffle Crema, Meyer Lemon & Black Garlic Nage, and Pork Belly Nuggets)
- INTERMEZZO
- GRILLED TENDERLOIN OF TRIBAL BUFFALO (Smoked Corn Puree, Cholla Buds, Merquez Sausage and Scarlet Runner Bean Chili, and Saguaro Blossom Syrup)
- GLOBAL ARTISAN CHEESE (Cheesecake with Blood Orange Gastrique)
- DESSERT

Warm utensils or cold utensils hint at the next dish in store.

This meal delivered big time. So many Native American elements I wanted to learn about were present: from the home-style breads to their knowledge to the local fruits and vegetables. The Hand Picked Lettuces and Sous Vide Cool Weather Roots were unique, fresh, and outstanding. The mushrooms were magical. Sweet potatoes? To this day, no other restaurant does more amazing things with sweet potatoes than Kai. And who knew you could use the saguaro cactus for its seeds or its syrup?

Yet despite carrying a Native American pride, it still borrows ideas from elsewhere. The blowtorch used to heat the lobster dish comes to mind. Or a Hudson Valley duck for its foie gras to pair with sweet potatoes and black truffles. 

Halfway through the meal, the waiters pulled back the curtains and suddenly the sun was setting over the valley. It was at that moment in time everyone in the dining area realized why we were all facing a certain direction. The sunset was stunning. 

Once I was done, I made my way to my rental car. I was trying to relive every moment. When I hopped into the car, I found there was bottled water, chocolates, and a personalized note from my waiter. I couldn't help but laugh. 

If that isn't service, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"Amazing, wether a special occasion or fine dining it is a restaurant that everyone needs to experience. The price is up there but well worth it if a stretch."}
{"text":"Visited Kai for the 4th time but first in a couple of years. New chef but just as fabulous as ever. It truly is impossible to describe just how wonderful their food is. The tastes are like nothing I have ever had before. It is hard to believe that food can be so special.  Service as always was impeccable. If you are looking for a special experience try Kai just once and you too will be hooked."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice - for anniversary celebrations. It truly is a 5 Star experience. My husband has worked in the food and restaurant industry for over 20 years and now compares everything to Kai - which is completely unfair! We have had the short story, as well as various other menu items. Everything is fabulous - presentation, flavor, the attention to detail...
Menus are designed by native artists, the table decor, the interior, etc. - all inspired by and/or done by Natives of various tribes. 
The service is impeccable - all employees are very knowledgeable & attentive. And the finishing touches (bottled water, a hand-signed note from our attendant & chocolates in the car that was pulled up from valet) was so personal. Kai amplified our anniversary celebrations! We hope to be able to visit again!"}
{"text":"Celebrated Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. Delicious food, excellent customer service! ."}
{"text":"Kai Restaurant is a Forbes Travel Guide five star and a five diamond AAA restaurant located in Chandler Arizona. 

Kai specializes in cuisine that is Native American tribal inspired sourcing as much regional ingredients as possible. The menu changes with the seasons and this season the menu features many different proteins such as elk, buffalo, pork, lamb and more. 

I found that the service was attentive and impeccable. Besides enjoying a shop stopping dinner this event also was slightly educational from the interpretations of menu paintings described by our server.

Dinner takes about three hours without the multi course tastings. Several amuse bouche are served and tribal flute music plays in the background.

I do note although they say they can accommodate anyone. I am not certain that they actually offer any vegetarian plates. Possibly only one of the salads might be vegetarian style but the other as I was surprised to find out after it was sitting in front of me that it  had squid in it. Ironically the salad was named, \"From The Garden\" I sure wasn't expecting squid and my server offered to make me a new one or get something else. I don't feel it's necessary to remove a star for this one fault since the salad was so absolutely stunning. 

I received the most sophisticated breath taking salad I've ever seen before that truly looked as if it was growing up from a garden with fancy vegetables I've never seen before like a small green with a fuzzy bright red top that I was told was some sort of spinach. The salad was delightful and looked magical. I was told it was a small plate and it was much larger than I expected it to be. 

For dinner I had the Chimayo Rubbed Dry Aged New York Stirp that came with horseradish potatoes gratin, creamed spinach, heirloom carrots with bordelaise sauce. The steak wasn't the most succulent steak I've ever had but it did have a really great crust on it that was very unique. The portion was very large for me and after eating enough I took home close to 7 ounces of steak. Heirlooms carrots were scented with vanilla or something that reminded me of vanilla. I thought the creamed spinach was very good but the potatoes gratin was slightly over salted. 

My husbands Elk Loin wrapped in Iberico seemed like a much more complex dinner and I went green with envy when they shaved fresh truffles over it.

Peanut butter in  mousse towers, peanut sponge cakes, crunchy peanut brittle dust and Jelly Dessert was many layers of peanut taste and very grown up jelly. Blackberry five spice sorbet, poached grapes and red wine hibiscus drops adorned the plate. This dessert really was amazing. It wasn't too sweet and was just right and had many different textures and was delicious.

Waiting for us in the car was a handwritten Thank You Card from the server, two bottles of water and a box of chocolates.

If you attended Devoured this year you might have picked up a card from Kai that would give each guest a complimentary glass of wine and a complimentary appetizer. For two people that adds up to a $70. savings. If you still have your card now is the time to try Kai if you were thinking of doing so."}
{"text":"Kai truly is an \"experience\" with the mini history and the indigenous menu; each explained by your waiter in limited detail. I highly recommend this as a destination with your out of town guests.  Fun place to show off Arizona's Indian culture.
The menu had something for everyone unlike some five star restaurants. 
Bread: Great! Focaccia w/ corn & peppers, baguette w/ seeds and grains, scones and keep 'em coming.
Salads & soup: Highly recommend the Heirloom Tomato Tarte-YUM! It had something called basil foam; sounds scary, but amazing!
Did not care for the cold avocado/cucumber soup that had a fishy fish in it.   Lobster trio good.
Amuse-bouche very tasty custard and lamb.
The New York Strip was melt in your mouth tender!  Also at our table we ordered the grouper, buffalo tenderloin and lamb...no disappoints.

The staff does make sure you have plenty of time between courses, maybe a little too much time, by the time the main course came we weren't hungry and they served big portions (hate to waste food!)  Also, when your on the patio and in the corner it's a little intimidating when 4 waiters converge on you all at once.  Maybe try 2 at a time or something different. 

Seriously though worth the trip and the money for great quality fresh food!"}
{"text":"Best place I have ever ate.  Did the journey and it was fantastic.  Twelve courses with a wine paring with each course.  The sommelier was excellent and explained the wine with each dish and how it paired.  The wait staff was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"The most expensive and best dinner my wife and I have ever had. We went all out for our 10 year anniversary and the memory will last a lifetime. Along with an absolutely outstanding meal, the server will tell you stories about each course. I recommend Kai to everyone I know if they are looking for an over the top dinner that puts any \"regular\" restaurant to shame."}
{"text":"This was an amazing dining experience I will never forget. The staff are so incredibly nice and knowledgeable. Very accommodating to any allergies as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten at some great places, and this is a GREAT place! The food was inventive and delicious. The courses were well paced, portioned, and the service was great. There was often some air of pretension, but what's a person to do at that price point?

First, the drinks. We spent a moment at the bar and found the cocktail program had recently been taken over by a new bartender. We tried a few of the classics from the menu and they were fine. Then, we tried a few of the drinks she was \"giving a shot\" for the new menu. They were excellent. Go sit at the bar and drink - drink your socks off! The great shame is that when you're at the resort alone you cannot go eat at their bar - which remains empty at the low season.

The menu is immediately odd to read and it takes a little guidance from your service staff to understand. Once you've gotten your bearings on the sizing, courses, tasting menu options... there are a lot of great options. I enjoyed this as I often find that restaurants of this type offer a restrictive menu that boarders on, \"we know what's best.\" 

We wandered through several courses that were each splendid. The spices were a great blend of classic flavorings and local inspiration. The veggies, seafood and game were all exceptionally fresh and well prepared. The service was prompt and informed. 

The wine list here was very nice and accessible. Some familiar bottles and a few more interesting selections. I do, however, warn you that the decanter is a piece of theater. It looks like the murder weapon in a futuristic space drama - and I was afraid of it. :) 

When in Phoenix you should go to Kai. Keep your group small and it won't disappoint. I would advise calling ahead, as the kitchen will not sit more guests than they are staffed for. I was at first annoyed, because I could see empty seats while I waited.... but, I got to try the cocktails that I so loved and when we did sit (not long after) the timing was impeccable."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Kai for our anniversary and had the most wonderful dining experience.  The attention to detail is amazing. We were welcomed by name and the servers used out names throughout the evening (appropriately so, not over used). I have dined all over the world and this tops my list of exceptional experiences.  The wait staff's attention to detail is amazing.  They provided great information and seemed genuinely delighted to share information and answer questions on the Indian culture, foods and wine.

The food was phenomenal. As each dish was presented, the staff explained each component.  The use of Native American food throughout the menu is delicious as well as fascinating.  Unique and delightful tastes wait on every plate. The Buffalo tenderloin and Elk Loin was delicious.

Upon retrieving our car from the valet, we found 2 bottles of water, a thank-you note and chocolates awaiting.

This is truly a fine dining experience.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for, and the exceptional food and service are worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night was absolutely perfect. I'm not sure I have ever had one more perfect.  The service was extraordinary from the valet parking to the dinner. Perfect is not over stating how marvelous it was. We started with the Amuse Bouche. My husband had escargot prepared in a manner that we've never seen before & I had a lobster dish which was fantastic. I almost forgot the assortment of home baked breads served to us with a delicious extra virgin olive oil. Of course there was the palate cleansing sorbet which was to die for. He had the sirloin steak, perfectly prepared medium rare and I had scallops. Oh, the chocolate soufflé followed by small chocolate truffles was incomparable. Of course when you get to your car there is Norwegian water, wild honey & muffins. After dining a this amazing restaurant, it is very difficult to have these dishes anywhere else because I don't think there is anywhere in Arizona that will compare to Kai.  Prepare for a culinary experience unrivaled anywhere else in Arizona."}
{"text":"Kai is unlike any experience I have ever encountered. My husband and I went for the first time as a birthday treat. Their service was exceptional and the food was both unique and delicious. You are definitely there for the experience or \"the journey\" as they so kindly put it. If you can ask for Jeremy! You are guaranteed a great time. I cannot critique anything. Everyone was nice. I can't quite explain the food, you just have to try it for yourself but trust me it's to die for."}
{"text":"Unreal.  Totally other-wordly both in terms of service and food.  Thanks to my lovely wife for taking me here for my birthday.  It was absolutely unlike anything we've done before.  And no, we didn't end up ordering the $10k bottle of wine...though maybe next time."}
{"text":"Epic 3-hour long dinner featuring indigenous flavors prepared by a very experienced chef with gorgeous views.  This wasn't even having the tasting menu.  A splurge.  Yes, worth it.  Why?  You really are invited to \"experience\" the food at Kai.  The staff are very formally trained (which can seem theatrical), but really when you consider the atmosphere, which features local beautiful arts & crafts as well as probably the best sunset views in the area, the flavors and presentation of the food (practically perfect), the slightly stiff staff presentations can be forgiven.  Plus, you can dress up! (but don't under-do it).

Part of the fun going into this dinner was the fact that my husband and I hadn't read anything about the restaurant, knew absolutely nothing about anything, but decided to go because we were staying at the resort and were there for a special occasion anyway.  They also had availability when we wanted to eat there and managed a reservation the night before for 5:45 PM (we were there until 8:30 PM).  Boy, were we in for a surprise!

We each ordered an item from the three courses: Birth, Beginning, and Journey.  For a total of 6 dishes between the two of us we were well fed for the price of about two of the 5-course meals; but because we went a la carte, we had a little more control over the selection, had more to share between the two of us, and were able to pass on the dessert (really unnecessary).

I can't get too detailed on each food item, because the menu is always changing.  But I will say that the husband and I were pretty much blown away by every selection.  The portions were large in terms of fancy restaurants; so shareable at every level (birth, beginning, and journey), but it was really fun to share between the two of us.  The presentation of the food, particularly the items from Birth and Beginning, was gorgeous.  The preparation of the food was just about perfect in terms of flavor complexity and techniques.  I was worried that the Journey would be disappointing because everything else was just unstoppable, but the meats were cooked exactly to our specifications.

If you're curious of the types of foods offered here, let me reiterate that the menu changes.. but some of the items included on our menu were foie gras, escargot, fry bread (so good), roasted vegetables, local cheeses, lobster, sheep, NY strip steak, Big Eye Tuna, Scallops, Duck, Tribal Buffalo, Elk Loin, Lamb; and techniques included molecular gastronomy, french...  In addition, the amuse bouche and intermezzo were a complimentary inclusion to our a la carte selection."}
{"text":"WOW!  It is very hard to impress me but this restaurant went above and beyond.  The service was flawless, decor Native American appropriate and food outstanding!  We were staying at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass on business and I went to Yelp to see where we should eat.  Lo and behold, Kai, a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star restaurant pops up and it's in our hotel.  

We arrive and the formalities start using our last names.  While I usually find it annoying, here it wasn't.  The waiter comes over who knows every item on the menu, many of which had ingredients for which we required more details.   All three of us were laughing as the menu was so spectacular we wanted to order it all.  All ingredients are locally sourced and most Native American unique. I would describe what I had but wouldn't do it justice.   The cuisine  is French that meets Native American.  I ate a fish dish and the others had meat. If my wife was with me, who is a vegetarian, she would have loved it equally as well. 

Also nice is that they had a great craft cocktail menu, a great selection of scotch, and knew how to mix a Perfect Martini.  Other unexpected surprises included small chef prepared dishes between meals, a free craft cocktail from the waiter, and when I returned to my room, a small linen \"Koi\" bag was hanging on my door with three mini muffins and homemade preserves, which were delicious.  

If you are looking for a restaurant and this is nearby, or even a bit of a drive, definitely enjoy it.  It will be one of the better experiences of your life! 

Price: 3 people, appetizer and entree each, probably 3 top shelf drinks each, $300. $360 after tip. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Truly a 5 star dining experience. The staff are knowledgeable, professional and the ambiance creates an incredible dining experience. 

The food is skillfully prepared by creative professionals. 

The sommelier was expert in the pairings and introductions for each of our courses. 

It was truly the best culinary experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Mind blown!!! I feel guilty giving anywhere else a five star rating after coming here, because it's in a league of its own. As an expert in fine dining, I can honestly say this is the best restaurant experience in America. Better than Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, and the famous French Laundry. Period. This chef deserves a James Beard Award more than anyone else. It should have multiple Michelin stars.

It's in the beautiful Wild Horse Pass hotel. The decor is modern with Native American influences. The windows allow you to watch the beautiful sunset while you dine. From a view perspective, it's impeccable! The wait staff is incredible. We had 10 different waiters, each of which were unbelievably knowledgeable regarding the menu. They intricately explained each course, the chef's inspiration, and the sourcing of ingredients. The staff bends over backwards to make you feel like royalty.

We did the 13 course tasting menu. They do have abnormal menu and a shorter tasting menu option (only 7 courses). But, I'd highly recommend the 13 courses, as it allows you to try nearly everything. It's called the journey, which is quite fitting.

The courses were as follows:

Foie gras amuse

Hahl soup with 32 hour brisket and prickly pear cotton candy - cotton candy melts as you eat it

Hand picked lettuces

The Preserved Garden

Foie gras and apple pie - The best foie gras I've ever had.

Elixir

Dusted hebi with tuna tartare and squid ink

Festival of seasons NY strip

Coconut taramind palate cleanser sorbet

Tenderloin of tribal buffalo

Cheese course

Deconstructed tiramisu.

Then, they bring local herbs in a wood bowl with rocks and dry ice. They pour tea over to and it smokes for a good 10 minutes, filling the entire room with a relaxing aroma. This was the absolute best culinary feat I've ever seen. More so than Grant Achatz's dessert balloons at Alinea. Epic, purely epic.

So, five hours later, we finished. As if the above experience weren't enough, the chef came out from the kitchen and greeted us. As we left, they put a thank you card, two Voss water bottles, and some homemade jelly in the car. All in all, the best restaurant in America. Well worth the price tag!!"}
{"text":"Having dined around the world in some of the best I can not think of another dining experience that compares. This is not just dining, but an event filled with Native American Culture and the most exquisite taste sensations you could ever imagine. This is not fast food and while they strive to accommodate, leave your bizarre dietary needs friends at home where they can graze, because you will want to taste everything prepared as is! If you are a foodie, this would be Mecca for you. Forget the prices and set aside time to enjoy the evening because as I mentioned, it is an event. An evening of being entertained as you're fed! Dishes are based around tribal ingredients and sometimes recipes! The staff expertly explains and answers questions about the dishes and the tribes. I strongly recommend the pairings! The wines were great and when I asked for a Tokai they had it! Even the Ritz in Chicago took a day to find a bottle of Tokai for us...in Chicago! The final great detail is the desert tea presentation towards the end of your meal which creates a mist which smells like the desert just after a precious rain. And if you have never had that aromatic experience, I can personally tell you those of us who have cherish that aroma as a life moment! It is such a beautiful aroma to top of an extraordinary evening of fine dining. Again, there is nothing like this restaurant.....anywhere! It is a one of a kind and I hope you get to enjoy it someday."}
{"text":"Jeremy and his team of wait staff are amazing. Their breadth of knowledge, sequential movements, attention to detail are second to none. I am originally from New York city let me tell you this restaurant exceeds even the 3 star Michelin restaurants like Per Se, Daniel, Le Bernadin, etc. I would come back to Arizona just for this place, it is THAT good. The ambience, scenery, service and dishes were all impeccable!!"}
{"text":"I went to Kai last week and it was awesome (see previous review). After a week in Alaska and missing my family I decided to take my daughter to a special dinner. She doesn't meet the age requirement but she behaves better than most adults so I knew she would behave and that she would absolutely love it. She has a very sophisticated palette, especially for a kid. After the amuse bouche, which was pretty great, we received gluten free bread service. I'm always impressed when places have a lot of gluten free options or variations since I have to be gluten free, it's not a preference. We started with a squash soup which had cotton candy in it made from prickly pear, the cotton candy melts as they pour in the piping hot soup and adds a hint of sweetness. We both loved the soup. As a matter of fact my daughter was offered a smaller portion, she opted for the regular size, and ate the whole thing.  We were given a sorbet to cleanse our palettes and I must say, it in itself was a treat. Next we moved on to our entrees. She ordered elk which was served over risotto, I had the bison. Both were cooked to perfection and had amazing taste!  We finished the night sharing a dark chocolate soufflé. It was out of this world!  We were thrilled with our meal, the service was on point  and the atmosphere was great. They do a lot of little extra things to make the experience amazing. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better we picked up our car from valet. Waiting on the dash was a thank you card and a little thank you gift of muffins and honey in a cute little wooden box. We also each had a Voss water waiting for us for the drive home.  I highly recommend this place. Be prepared for a lengthy meal, they do things right, things are not rushed. 

Ad far as price, starters are $20-30 and entrees are in the $50 range. Wine prices vary, as expected.  We highly recommend Kai, it is a truly amazing experience."}
{"text":"Extremely well organized staff! We loved Kevin our waiter. He was so sweet, charasmatic and came around at the right times. Also we appreciated Kevin the wine expert. I felt like I was watching a play. The staff would synchronize their visits to your table and keep their left hand tucked behind their back. Some dishes were incredible. This was the 1st fine dining experience I left full. For a 5 year anniversary night this was an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review Kai! We had our anniversary dinner here and it was lovely. I won't repeat what everyone said, food was delicious, service excellent. 
My only negatives don't affect my rating: First, we were sitting next to a group of elderly diners that were rather loud and discussing the surgeries of their friends. Not something we were interested in hearing while dining. I was glad they left before us. Second, while the plates were beautiful I'm not a huge fan of \"deconstructed\" food presentation. 

Expensive, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Absolutely a worthwhile experience! Our server, Kevin, was very knowledgable and friendly. The food journey was delightful and although we were there 3 hours, the entire evening was perfect and dishes were well timed. It was truly a night to remember!"}
{"text":"I heard some hubbub about this place being a five diamond restaurant and was curious so I decided to come check it out. Seriously, one of the best places I have ever been. 

My friends and I met here for dinner. Dinner was not only dinner. The restaurant made it a whole experience. At every point in our dinner, there was a narration and experience. Our menus had some local art, and our waiter explained its significant. Some points, there were olfactory experiences while other transition points yielding cold washcloths for freshening. The service was excellent and was a significant distinguishing feature. Our waiter and servers were very knowledgeable and engaging. They explained all our dishes and were able to answer any questions we had. Every person at our table had our food served at the same time. The food itself was excellent and interesting. I believe their food is culturally based, and they did serve many options that are usually served at traditional restaurants. My boyfriend's dish had edible dirt. They also served buffalo with a sauce that tasted literally like campfire. It was amazing. They do have a tasting menu, in the event you wish to try multiple options. Their cocktails were very tasty, and they do have beer and wine as well.

The cherry on top: our server took our valet slip. Upon leaving, they retrieved our car and when we got inside the car, we saw they had placed Voss glass bottles of water for every person in our car. They also placed some mini treats and a \"thank you\" card. I found this last part to be such a special experience. I mean, what restaurant does that?!

Amazing place. Amazing experience. It is pricey, but if or when you can spare the expense, I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"this place had superb service. everytime the dishes are brought, they swarm to your table at the same time and put down the dishes at the same time. reminds me of the scene from beauty and the beast when they sang \"be our guest\"!
the food was cooked very well and the seafood was very fresh. its a long meal so prepare for that.
if you want your food togo, make sure to tell them before they take it away though."}
{"text":"You would be hard pressed to find a better place to eat in the country.  It's starts with amazing views, goes to the hand painted menus each with it's own story, continues into the regionally inspired cocktails and then takes off with the food.  Each dish has just the right touch of Southwest ingredients and they are executed to perfection.  Oysters and caviar - delicious.  Love escargot.  The lobster and foie gras were equally decadent.  Everything was great, but the Buffalo tenderloin is clearly the star.  The service is top notch.  We went for a birthday and they brought out an amazing chocolate souffle for our birthday girl.  Outstanding evening."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give more than 5 stars, we would. Our party of five was impressed on every level - service, food, ambiance. All of our dishes were  creative, tasted phenomenal, and a pleasure to look at as well.  We are no strangers to fine dining but this was the best service we have ever seen. Kevin took such great care of us, we will be back, and soon! 

We returned this weekend, still out of this world food and service- thanks, Jackson!"}
{"text":"Special occasion masterpiece that is worth a trip across the valley or even across the country. Simultaneous service by 4 waiters for four people. Chef provided extra course treats and adapted to food preferences/ intolerances."}
{"text":"I took my wife for her birthday dinner. Amazing place. Service above and beyond expectations. We plan to visit this restaurant again in near future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! AMAZING!! On a whim, we called to make reservations for the last night of our honeymoon and were able to get an early, 530 pm seating. I asked for a later time and was a little put off by the way they said no. I started to cancel based on that interaction, but lucky for me and the rest of my food-loving-life, I didn't. The experience starts when you park. The valet greets you and asks for your name (for a later surprise, that I won't give away). We were seated in a beautiful room with windows that probably would've displayed a great sunset if we'd arrived earlier (don't cry for me, Argentina, we watched the sunset before we came ;) We were given the option of a flavor enhancer (lime, cucumber, orange, and maybe lemon slices; it was Dec 2013, so I don't remember) which was so tasty. Like they even paid attention to the flavor enhancers and didn't just chop them days ahead as a cast aside. I could write novels about my experience there, but I'll give you the highlights. We choose to make our own tasting menu since it was our go-big honeymoon meal. Best decision ever!!! We had the vegetable garden to start. Hubs still raves about how flavorful the baby carrot was, lol. We had a lobster trio dish, black squid ink pasta with seafood, two fish courses and maybe something else. It was the best meal of my life. So much attention to detail, focus on the experience for the customer, and an effort to connect with the culture from which the food came. We felt so special. It was a great end to our beautiful beginning (gag, sorry so sappy)"}
{"text":"Kai is certainly an AZ treasure. I had forgotten how really great the place is, but had the opportunity to dine there again recently. What sets it apart is the seamless quality of the food and service.

With regards to food, it is loosely variations on native american fare. However, there are lots of luxury twists, such as seared foie gras, escargot, etc. We chose to order individual dishes, but there are two extensive tasting menus that can be paired with wine. Perhaps the most beautiful was a composed salad \"From the Garden\". The mains we enjoyed most were the \"Coriander-Sumac Spiced Rack of Lamb\" and \"Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo\", which we ordered mid-rare.

The cocktails were outstanding. I had a riff on an old fashioned which and they also sampled us the \"Smokey Almond\" which I would certainly recommend. The wine list is extensive and tends to be pricey, but the wine service itself is perfect.

Service is a level above anything else I've experienced in Arizona. The attitude is one of graciousness and a peaceful pace, without dragging. The team is very well coordinated, bring out the dishes simultaneously. One never needs to ask for anything as they anticipate your needs. Lots of meaningful touches add up. For instance, the coffee is served table side as either french press or ceramic drip. When you go to you car, you find signature chocolates, Voss water and a handwritten thank you note from the waiter."}
{"text":"KAI is well, KAI for a reason.  Food was amazing! Service is over the top. Pricey...YES, worth it, absolutely! Save up and make this a stop.  Well worth it. Take a tour...best way to try alot!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday with her sisters and their husbands last weekend. To start with we are all 6 foodies and this place lived up to the hype and is really special!

The location is set back quite a bit from the casino. There is a free shuttle that runs between the two which we took after dinner and it was about a 10 minute wait as we missed one that was completely full.

You enter through the Sheraton hotel lobby and quite frankly it wasn't the best first impression. The restaurant entrance itself is off to the left side and is just a simple podium by a nice small entry area with a fireplace. 

They weren't seating outside due to the weather so we were near the window in first area. At first they had the blinds closed and they ambiance simply was a bit plain. I felt like it could've been a hundred restaurants I've been in. They opened the blinds a bit later (our reservations were at 6:15) and that definitely helped the feeling of confinement, and the outside area looked really nice. I would definitely recommend sitting outside if it's available. 

Starting with the service, which is impeccable, we had two waiters, both of which were great and our \"main\" waiter was amazing, a wine steward (boring and a bit put off by my questions, although he gave great advice), and for our table several helpers. 

Service starts with a long winded review of the unique, hand painted art on the cover of each menu. I'm guessing this would be great at two menus but we had six and it could use to be shortened. 

Since there were 6 of us we tried a number of dishes and shared bites. In the \"birth\" section the smokiness in the Hal is really good and it was the surprise of the round but the escargot was everyone's favorite. The pee posh looked great but it was more of a medley than a dish and was just ok. The staff brought our food out and servers everyone at the table simultaneously.

In the \"beginning\" section we tried all four and the Foie gras was my favorite dish of the night! Really complex, and even amongst the other very strong dishes it stood out. The grouper cheeks were much heartier than I expected and were flavored really well, almost blackened. The lobster, which they finished at the table, was great and was prepared in 3 was, with the largest of the 3 portions being the best. The duo of goose and rabbit was good not great. Others liked it more than I did but to me it paled in comparison to the other 3. 

In the \"Journey\" section I had the Arctic Char which was very light, moderately seasoned and simple. Good taste not great. My wife had the Fly South (duck) and it was prepared in 3 ways, two of which I really liked. The Buffalo was a really nice thick cut, very flavorful and the sides it comes with really compliment it nicely. 

We had chocolate soufflé for dessert and it was fantastic, as was the small sherbet intermezzo. 

Overall slightly out of the way location, just ok ambiance, but between the staff and food it makes for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"We were here last night and Kai is changing along with Phoenix, I think for the better. It's always been a well run machine, but I think smoother and seasoned now.

The menu featured autumnal flavors.  I had soup, the lobster trio and for an entree The Three Sisters, which were scallops.

I love seeing Native American culture succeed at this level, so for me it's both an artistic and culinary experience. I thought the scented fog experience at the end of the meal was a nice touch.

I've learned to pace myself at this restaurant. The food is some of the richest I've ever eaten. Taking a couple acidophilus beforehand helps. I ended up bringing home two large 'doggy' bags, only partly because I couldn't eat it all. My experience is when you ask to take something home from this restaurant, you're going to get home and find LOTS of wonderful surprises!"}
{"text":"Service, food, setting: Unbelievable. Spectacular. Interesting. Incredibly inventive. Foodie heaven. I could go on...... and on......"}
{"text":"Wow. I saw Cirque De Soleil in Vegas with my wife some year's ago. I under estimated the effect it would have on me. 

Tonight, I experienced that same effect, but with a restaurant and not a performance. 

Although. Kai is a kind of performance that I was delighted to be a part of. From the ritualized watercolor menu signature presentation sanctioned by a holy man to just some of the most killer-kick ass food on the planet. I understand why this place consistently gets 5 stars. 

I understand it to be one of the few true 5 star restaurants in the nation. One pricey visit and you will no doubt understand why. 


I found out about a special summer menu (from Mouth By Southwest)  that is  tailored to valley locals for $65 plus a well welcome wine flight for $15 on top that runs from May to late July. 


You have to go. I almost want to take stars away from my other reviews because this one is that cool. Located a few miles away from the casino \"Wild Horse Pass\" at a most amazing Sheraton. 

The pudding, the bison, the amuse' bouche, the staff, the scenery, the cucumber caviar, ... ... the finish. 

It's a culinary performance that you do not want to miss."}
{"text":"PERFECTION.

Best restaurant in AZ hands down. It is over the top. From the moment you walk in, the service, the execution of the food, the wine pairings, the artistry of the menu, from the moment you leave - a handwritten thank you note, water, and chocolates in your car. Everything is on point. Pure artistry and close attention to every detail. Very, very expensive but worth it. The price point will probably keep me from becoming a regular but I very much look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic restaurant. Top notch professional service. Excellent tables. Food was absolutely incredible (we chose the Tasting Menu). It was a true dining experience with attentive, professional waiters, a relaxed atmosphere so that I could enjoy a wonderful meal with my wife. I can't say enough. Honestly. If you are in town and can afford the menu, the time, and the trip, you will not be dissatisfied. Please look at my other reviews. I don't give 5 stars to every restaurant. Kai deserves every accolade I can give it."}
{"text":"The night started off with a bet. The partner and I were celebrating our first year anniversary and there wasn't a better place to celebrate than Kai. After having an excellent adult beverage at the bar we found out our server from the last visit was working and requested him. I bet the tab that if my partner called Kevin, K-Money or K-Dawg, I'd be happy to pay.  Well he did and Kevin ran with it.  He's the kind of server that even if we asked for him to rap for us he'd do it. He laughed at my jokes about the super bowl half time show and showed genuine interest when we discussed Indigenous creation stories.
We had initially decided to forgo the birth and order everything off the beginning then our entrees, but Kevin and our bartender swore by the deliciousness of the soup. 
Any fine diner in the valley can attest the super popularity of truffle and how over used the product can be. It's become almost like the useless parsley on your Denny's breakfast platter, with the exception that it over powers the many crudos and veggies it's meant to compliment. It's become so overwhelming that anytime I see it on the menu, no matter how appetizing the food may sound, I opt for something else.  However, Kai does it right. The truffles balanced the lamb, potato and broth with an earthy sweetness that made it over the top.  Just smelling the soup put a smile to my face.
The escargot was just as wonderful.  The entire beginning was awesome, though this time we did not order the lobster.
Just before our entree service we got some bad news so I can't comment much on the main course.  What I can comment on, is that K-Money was awesome about us having to cut out early. He boxed our entrees without us having to ask and sent us home with a complementary dessert and truffles. The sweet potato cake was sweet, moist and the accoutrements went well with the cake. Kevin listened well to our needs, knowing I was not a chocolate person and partner was. He found the balance we needed to share a dessert. 
To top it all off, we found a card waiting in the car when we got it back from the valet. The usual chocolate bar and water bottles were there, but the card was signed K-Money.  It was small touch, but it showed how much they valued us as customers. 
And while many may look at other restaurants because the price tag is intimidating, for the service and food, Kai is worth much more. With a bottle of Dom, four cocktails, and all our food, the bill was still under 500.00. It's a must have for any special occasion."}
{"text":"The first night, the salmon was very good, but the second night my chicken was dry and terrible. With tip it cost almost sixty dollars, and that is just unacceptable. I wish that I had sent it back, instead of just accepting that. My entire dinner was disgusting and very expensive."}
{"text":"The food, drinks and ambiance were all great, but the service is what really set this restaurant above the rest. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of handing out the 5s, but this is worth it. Was there for a business meeting, and thus wasn't worried about the tab. The hosts provided a fixed menu, which included a choice of NY strip steak/fish...I had the steak...not sure I'll ever want to have another one. The food was perfect, the appetizers/salads/desserts just as good. The service for our group was impeccable and they added some nice touches with fresh bread (right out of the oven) and a few tasters, courtesy of the chef. 

Would highly recommend if you're willing to go into a hotel to eat. If you are on site anyways it's a must visit. I believe it's the only 5 star restaurant as of now in AZ."}
{"text":"Only had an after-dinner drink at the bar. They have a nice cocktail menu and I wound up with a yummy martini. Great service and a good drink!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how to review this. I knew this was going to be an event dinner, just no clue as to how much of one.

The evening started as we gave our vehicle to the valet. There was a person from the restaurant at the front door who knew our name and that it was our anniversary. She took the valet ticket and escorted us to the restaurant. Not that fancy or impressive of a dining room. Very quiet but comfortable. Everyone working there knew our names and that we were celebrating our anniversary. The waiter came over and explained the process as well as the paintings on the walls. 

I had done some reading and was excited to try their tasting menu. They have a 7 course and a 13 course one. We chose the 7 course. Everyone at the table has to get the menu.

We started out with something called 'Amuse'. It was a cracker with some stuff on it. I can't remember exactly what. It was delicious but I was saying to myself 'great, I'll have to go to McDonald's on the way home'. I was wrong.

Next course was Ha:l which was a mesquite smoked squash puree. It was heavenly!

Next was Three Sisters which is a scallop, caviar, squash, pasta and bean crackling. My wife didn't like scallops or caviar. She does now.

Next was Intermezzo, which was some delicious sherbet.

Next was Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo. Wow doesn't do it justice! Menu says \"Smoked Corn Puree, Cholla Buds, Chorizo and Scarlet Runner Bean Chile, Saguaro Blossom Syrup\". The combination was delicious!

Next was Global Artisan Cheeses. This was the only disappointment of the evening and it was our own fault. They asked what kind of cheeses we liked and we told them to have the chef pick. He picked some of the driest cheeses I've ever had and it was just not to our taste. The stuff that came with it was delicious, however.

Last but not least was desert. I can't remember the exact selections I got but it was really good!

As the evening wound down, we left and found our car sitting out front with two ice cold bottles of water in the cup holders as well as a tin with some muffins and honey and a hand written card thanking us for spending our anniversary with them.

Start to finish was almost 3 hours and while we weren't stuffed, we were full and satisfied. All I need to do now is sell a kidney and go back for the 13 course meal!"}
{"text":"I could never speak more highly of this wonderful restaurant. First of all the service we received there was impeccable. Our lead waiter Kevin was fabulous and such a joy to have throughout the dinner. The food? Well you will not experience cuisine much better than this, especially in the States. Each course was delightful and amazingly flavorful in its own way. Don't even get me started on the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. Kevin described it like dessert and I never would have thought foie gras could be so magnificent! It's a must try when you go. From the Journey (our main entrees) my husband ordered the Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo and I ordered the High Country Elk Loin. Both were delightful, but if I had to choose one the Tribal Buffalo was pretty outstanding. I've read mixed reviews on the sensory experience, but I have only positive things to say. My husband and I love to spend hours at a dinner such as this and the sensory experience only added to our time at Kai. I could go on and on, but overall just know if you find yourself in the Phoenix area try Kai. It's worth the drive and cost! Also, book a reservation well in advance."}
{"text":"I love to go back here. I went to Kai for my anniversary with my basketball T-shirt and shorts. There was not many people there and I went there not knowing what was waiting for me. It was a fancy restaurant and super expensive. I would have dressed up if I knew. I live few miles away from there and I went there looking all sporty. Even though the price was high, the service was great, the story behind this food and restaurant was great. Everything was perfect and I would like to go back there."}
{"text":"If I were a Michelin judge, I would be awarding Kai and Chef  Ryan Swanson 3 stars (for you non Michelin aficionados, the BEST).  This is definitely a restaurant you should put on your destination list.  Meaning you should come for the food and the experience, no matter where you live.  I am saddened that Chandler, AZ is not on the Michelin guide list.

Kai is more than food, it is an experience.  It starts with your hostess, who memorizes your name whether it's a difficult Ghanaian or Greek name (kudos ladies, you pronounced them perfectly) and uses it several times while everyone is being seated.  Then your Maitre'd will continue the use of your properly pronounced name throughout your meal.  The staff, THE STAFF is a perfectly choreographed ballet.  They balance a formal service with personality and style.  The table service is some of the best I have ever had.

The FOOD, OMG THE FOOD.  We were fortunate enough to land a table for 4 for their Valentine's Day meal.  It was held the day before, because Kai is closed on Sundays.  The meal was a prix fixe which was a gamble for a couple of us.  Hubby has dietary restrictions as did one of our guests, she is EXTREMELY allergic to seafood.  I had mentioned these restrictions when making reservations and they were brought up immediately upon our seating and then re-referenced with each course, highlighting changes that were made to accommodate each guests plate.  They were on it!!!  Since the dinner was pre arranged, I feel sorry for all of you that will not get to experience the dishes we had last night.  They were so delectable and want to have them all over again.

We started with an Amuse, I can't remember what it was, but it came beautifully arranged on a small plate and was delicious, what a wonderful way to wake up our palates.  Our first course was ridiculous, foie gras and champagne, with almond milk froth, honey and mesquite brioche.  Next course was lobster and caviar \"risotto\", but instead of rice it was made with wheat berries (TO DIE FOR).  Then a sweetgrass and rosemary smoked squab breast, let me pause here.  The presentation for this dish was remarkable.  Imagine all 4 servers, plus the maitre'd coming out at the same time, surrounding the table carrying 4 beautiful large white bowls with tagine tops, they are placed at all 4 guests at the same time and the tagine lids, lifted at the same time.  Then suddenly this sexy rosemary smoke floats towards each guest and just fills your nostrils.  MY GOD, all our senses were going before we even took a bite into this course.  Just STUNNING.  We were then given an elixir in a shot glass to cleanse our palate once more.  The next course was a sage ash rubbed venison loin.  This course was so delicious, tender, melt in your mouth fabulousness.  I want to be able to order this over and over again.  Our final course was dessert, aptly named Roses are Red and Chef Swanson did a play on the rose from Beauty and The Beast.  It was delicious, but honestly I had no room left to do it justice.  I had a taste of everything and it was wonderful, but none of us could really finish our dessert.  Chef used molecular gastronomy throughout the meal and the dessert was his crowning jewel.  

I did not take pictures throughout this meal, this meal was about enjoying the experience, the food and our company.  I did not want to cloud it with an electronic device.  Just trust me and go enjoy this experience.  YES, the dining area is understated, isn't going to win a decorating award anywhere, but I believe this is purposeful so that your focus is on the food and not the decor.  The room is elegant, quiet and very comfortable.  I would love to eat in an environment like this more often.

Side note:  I had the pleasure of running into Chef Ryan Swanson earlier in the day and ladies he is a real cutie.  He is shy and has a smile that matches the beauty of his food.  So keep your eye on the kitchen door, you may catch a glimpse of him when he peeks out to view the room."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is absolutely soothing & gorgeous! Kevin, our food connoisseur walked us through the history of the restaurant, the natives, and the food.
It was not so much the food that makes this place so magical, but the charm & the staff! Jackson, our other food connoisseur, was extremely attentive & obliging when it came to answering some questions I had.
Overall, this is a great place to go & unwind & enjoy the art of cooking because each dish truly looked like a work of art."}
{"text":"I cannot go on enough ! This place is incredible. So much polish! The servers were on point.  From the incredible greet at the door, to napkin service, to the kindest sommelier. Our server Kevin was so well spoken and knowledgeable. His little touches made the meal remarkable. Dayton was on it. He noticed everything and seemed to always be around. I can't get over how great the food was. Each dish, more incredible than the  next. Execution was flawless. As a person in the industry, this is the place to beat and be inspired by. They even sent little muffins to our room before we got back. This was hands down the best meal and experience I have ever had. Hats off to Ryan, Jack,  Michael, and the rest of the culinary team!!!! You are remarkable! Thank you for making my 30th birthday the best ever !!!"}

{"text":"Because my home state of California stupidly banned the sustainable foie gras, I had to find a restaurant during my vacation in Arizona that had foie. The law is stupid because banning the barely produced and consumed foie is another step in the wrong direction of letting the morality of a select few control our food when we should be more concerned with human safety along with livestock safety - like chickens fed with grains that are laced with antibiotics, caffeine, prozac, etc. which, in turn, negatively impacts human biology.

Obviously, we ordered every foie gras dish on the menu and turned the start of the meal into a foie gras tasting.

The seared foie gras was a lovingly big and luscious piece of fatty liver with a clever and yummy white powder of foie. The rest of the dish was an abundant amount of various forms of sweet with funnel cake, apple and pear preserve, Port and Saguaro syrup sauce, and banana cream. Take away the foie and it sounds like a dessert. The heavy use of sweet was recurring in chef Joshua Johnson's cooking.

The duck duo was a dance between sweet and spice with the lightly bruleed foie gras torchon (sweet), the duck rillette (spicy), the raspberry and chile jam (sweet), the canele of chili and golden raisins (sweet). The four parts of the dish were individually good, but the overkill of ingredients caused problems where the rillette clashed with the jam. Again, sweetness was aggressively used.

The quail and rabbit dish was highlighted by the wonderful piquillo pepper sauce and tomatillo crema. The dark smoked quail breast was better than the salty rabbit. I'm not sure what made the cornbread \"60 Day\", but it was moist and not sweet to provide a good foundation for the plate.

The most traditional dish of the night was the elk loin wrapped in Iberico lomo. By adding truffle risotto, wild mushrooms, Comte cheese, and truffle sauce, the focus was on earthiness. I liked the dish because it was the least sweet plate of the evening. But when there was a lack of sweet, the kitchen replaced it with too much salt just like the quail and rabbit dish. It was a shame because the meat and risotto were otherwise perfectly executed.

The pecan coated lamb was dry and oddly placed on a thick layer of olive tapenade and a hard puff pastry. The seeds and aromatic spices from a refined and elegant mole sauce adventurously tried to tie the dish together and succeeded with the nutty lamb, but not with the olives.

For dessert, the fry bread puffs were like round churros coated in vanilla sugar. Piped with lemon cream and served with a side of bright lemon and blackberry sorbet, it was a solid dessert. It was also a big dessert where the 8 doughnut-like holes were too much for two people.

The kitchen is trying to attain a very high bar with complex dishes. Unfortunately, fancy food doesn't win points with me, but flavorful food does. So when the flavors on savory dishes slant towards being either too sweet or too salty, I lose interest. I appreciate the work and use of unique ingredients which contributed to the 4-stars, but the dishes were too fussy.

Although there are three courses on the menu, \"The Birth\", \"The Beginnings\", and \"The Journey\", ordering a dish from each section is too much food. \"The Birth\" and \"The Beginnings\" were appetizer-like dishes and \"The Journey\" was entrées.

With $20 appetizers, $48 entrees, and $15 desserts, this is not for the budget conscious. The many amenities like the bottled water, three types of bread, a smooth amuse of mushroom mousse, sorbet palate cleanser, chocolate truffles, pulling up the car before leaving the restaurant, free valet parking, and stocking the car with chocolate squares and water helped to justify the $371 total tab for two."}
{"text":"My prediction: this restaurant will receive a Michelin star (or rising star), and soon.

Compared to the two (one-starred) restaurants I have eaten at (in NYC and Napa Valley) I would say the cuisine is par and the service/experience is even better.

I particularly appreciate the expanded take on indigenous cuisine in each course- from the amusee to the sorbet palate cleanser to the dessert.  And the primary dishes off the menu do not disappoint.  Table-side flambe' of fresh marshmallow and a drizzle of liquor before pouring the soup into the bowl?  Gorgeous.  A few \"threads\" of squid ink pasta under the shellfish?  Well yes, thankyoumoreplease! 

I don't typically spend this much on a meal unless it is a very special occasion date with my husband.  But I was determined to try Kai while traveling to Scottsdale.  I (insert effort of bravery) made reservations to dine solo.  Every aspect of the process- phone call, confirmation, free valet, escort, table-side service (friendly and attentive without one iota of snobbery!), and departure (chocolate truffles to go and a handwritten thank-you note from the lead waiter and a bottle of VOX waiting in my car!)- was the definition of \"above and beyond.\"

The prices are steep.  And OH SO worth it."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Chi! I will start with the service. We were greeted at the entrance of the hotel and escorted to the restaurant and promptly seated. 

We were there for my sisters birthday and the staff greeted us by our names and wished my sister a happy birthday. 

We both chose the \"Short Story\" 6 course tasting paired with 2 glasses of Riesling...it was out of this world! Great flavor profiles and the dishes with spice had just enough to enjoy but not overpowering. 

I had questions about the Michelin star system and the staff had a manager come over who was so knowledgeable and explained everything to me. The other staff engaged in conversation about wines etc...it was so fun as a foodie to \"talk shop\" with these people! 

It's all about the little extra touches...a birthday candle on an additional complimentary dessert, a gift when you leave, a signed bday card by the staff for my sister, our free valet waiting for us when we walked outside, and a bottle of water and parting gift waiting in the car for us! Just complete top notch service on all fronts! Feliciano and Robert were beyond fantastic! 

I would recommend Kai to anyone...the hefty price tag is well worth the experience!"}
{"text":"This is a truly amazing restaurant. The view is fantastic- get a window table on a clear night to get a great sunset. The service is thoughtful, friendly and expert- explaining each dish well, appearing just when we needed them, and catering to our every need.

And the food....was Michelin Star quality. Each dish was a work of art, perfectly prepared, capturing the essence of the dish while mixing in textures, colors, smells and flavor nuances. We especially liked the chocolate soufflé since these are hard to find- and it was fluffy and heavenly, not a misnamed lava cake like so many can be.

Certainly one of the very best restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Kai last week. Let me start by saying that if I could give the service 10 stars I would.  So I know I am not the norm for not giving kai a 5 star review, but I dined at ALEX in Vegas like 1 week before I ate this meal, so I had a huge benchmark to hurdle. I cannot say enough about how good the service is here.. Not stuffy, stupid attentive, and some of the most friendly staff I have encountered. THE FOOD: Some dishes were outstanding, some dishes missed the mark.. 4 people, 3 of us had 4 courses ala carte, all different, and my wife had the tasting menu. We ran the gammit, I was wafer-thin full when I was done. THE HIGHS: Lobster degustation, buffalo tenderloin, Fois Gras, and the Goat meat was insane, as was the heirloom tomato tarte. THE NOT SO GOOD: Over cooked Veal Ribeye, The goat cheese fondue side for the NY Strip..(Think millionares ranch dressing) Some of the garnish and sides were undercooked, or a little soggy.(Truffle oil pom frittes) Probably the best souffle I have ever had... The decor and atmosphere warrant 1 star. Seriously guys.. 50 bucks a plate, and there is no transformation to a different stratesphere.. expectation at this 5 diamond level are Micheal Jordan high, but smudges all over the glass wall definetely do not help the surroundings. 4 People, 4 hours, 800 bucks, a smashing time, a great experience, Stated already: Best service in Maricopa county.. People make the experience.."}
{"text":"This was amazing. We're talking multiple mouthgasms here.  I took my fellow foodie here for her birthday and I had three mouthgasms, she had five(!) We shared everything and here's what we ordered, with a star * for each of our mouthgasms:
1. Escargot, Wild Mushroom & Caramel Goat Cheese **
2. Grouper Cheeks 
3. Foie Gras & Onions **
4. Wild Boar and Mangalitsa Belly
5. Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo **
6. Chocolate Souffle *
7. Pistachio Baklava
8. Coffee, fresh dripped tableside *
Some restaurants are hit-and-miss with their food but not here. Everything we had was good, even the dishes that did not earn a star for the coveted mouthgasm. Not only was the food amazing but the service was truly flawless and over-the-top.  Kudos to our server Jeremy and his assistant Alicia.  He was a menu expert and we had so many thoughtful touches, i.e. hot silverware for hot dishes, cold silverwave for cold dishes, tableside presentations, splitting of certain dishes, two amuse bouche (a lobster bite and a ginger-berry sorbet). He asked for our names and called us by our names all evening. We left feeling absolutely pampered. Don't hesitate! So worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the whole dining experience! Interesting, unique food and fantastic service. You will know exactly what you are eating, because they describe what is in each dish to a tea. They addressed us each as \"mr and mrs\" and even had a hand written thank you in our valeted vehicle, with bottles of water and a small box of chocolates!! Really? That's above and beyond! I would recommend this to someone who is willing to try something new, and enjoys fine dining with top notch service!"}
{"text":"Aside from a one-time visit to Binkley's in Cave Creek last year, my girlfriend and I really don't have much experience with fine-dining. After seeing Kai constantly popping up on Phoenix' \"Best Of\" lists, I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. We made a reservation for the weekend of my 34th birthday, which we booked pretty far in advance.

We were definitely not disappointed. The quality (and taste) of the food, the attention to detail, and courteousness of the servers are all top notch. We were referred to by our names by the staff, well accommodated with specific requests, and felt as comfortable as you can be in an environment that can be somewhat intimidating if you're unfamiliar with it.

Both my girlfriend and I debated on whether to order the 7-course Short Story or 13-course Journey from the tasting menu. Ultimately, we decided on the Short Story, which despite the name, ended up being more than enough food to satisfy us.

Their menus feature beautiful Native American paintings, each having a distinct back-story that was described in great detail by our server. Every dish had a story, including some of the tiniest details on the plates that we'd probably overlook if we weren't paying attention.

We received a wide variety of different breads to try, along with local olive oil. All were incredibly unique and incredibly delicious. After devouring the original three, they brought out three different ones for us to try. We received a potato puree soup, which was absolutely phenomenal (and I don't even like soup!).  

Since I expressed to our server that I don't like seafood, my Three Sisters (scallops) was swapped out with a foie gras. Initially, I was hesitant, as once again, I don't really like liver - but I guess that's because I've never had good liver, because this was superb! Even my girlfriend's scallops, which I'd normally not even go near, were actually done very well. I guess if there's one thing that I learned after dining here, it's that you don't necessarily know what you like and dislike until you've actually tasted things done exceptionally well.

The cold sorbet we received as a palette cleanser actually startled me by the amount of purely natural flavor it contained.

The tribal buffalo we received as a main entree (cooked medium well - don't judge!), was some of the best meat I've ever had, with the chorizo adding in a spice that adds mild heat, but not to the point where it's offensive. The global artisan tray contained a wonderful cheddar-like cheese from England and a brutally potent blue cheese that lingered on our palettes long after we finished.

For dessert, we received sweet potato cake that included a tamarind sorbet, which was extremely good. When we return, however, I'd love to try their fry bread and tribute to chocolate full-plate desserts, as it looks like they have many exciting options that I'd expect great things from.

After picking up my car with the valet, we found a hand-written card, two bottles of water, and some chocolates. They couldn't have done it any better!

In summary, Kai is an experience that you must try - if only once. The food, the service, the atmosphere, and the whole experience definitely puts it at the top of my list as one of the best dining experiences we've ever had.

Note: After returning a couple of years later for another birthday celebration, I see no need to update this review. Everything was as consistently great as it was during our first trip.

Recommended to the highest extent possible!"}
{"text":"Amazing culinary adventure to be sure. This was my birthday present from my lovely wife. We were joined with our best Foodie friends for this fantastic dining experience. Paul P's review was spot on for the ambiance, level of service and spectacular dining fare. 
We opted for the \"Short Story\" tasting menu, paired with wines. I have no idea how I'd be able to survive the 11 course \"Journey\" tasting menu. We were dining for just under 2 1/2 hours as it was! We did add the Foie Gras to make it an eight course meal. If you have the time, spirit of adventure and disposable income, I highly recommend this restaurant and menu choice. 
Our server, Feliciano, was as terrific as the food. He made sure all our needs were addressed and each course was described with precise detail. Our Sommelier, whose name I unfortunately don't remember, also did an amazing job pairing some fantastic wines with each course. He took us from Hungary to Argentina, and all points in between. 
Was it the best meal I've ever had? I don't know, but I'm having a hard time remembering a better meal."}
{"text":"When was the last time you saw a restaurant where every single reviewer agreed on the rating - and they were all 5 stars?  If you are thinking about eating here, and wondering if it is really as good as everyone says, then stop wondering.  The answer is \"yes, it really IS that good.\"

The experience starts at the bar where the selection of signature drinks is full of unique ingredients that you will not find anywhere else.  Truffle martinis, ancho-chili infused house-made vodka, mesquite syrup, and a variety of other unique ingredients should start to tell you that you are in for a special experience.

Service is impeccable, from the hostess stand to the bar to the restaurant.  The experience builds as the servers share the story of the Maricopa and Pima Indians and the history that acts as the influence for the restaurant.  The entire meal is like a well choreographed play, flawless in every respect.

The food can be best described in one way - flavor combinations.  The pairing of quince and foie gras or chorizo with cholla buds and corn puree simply \"works\".  Each ingredient, although delicious is its own right, is heightened and enhanced by the others.

I could go on and on about the details, but I really believe that you need to experience it for yourself.  There is no point in spoiling the experience for a first time diner.  Just know that the reputation is not hype - this place is for real."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with both awesome food and service, you gotta try this out. Must try ELK"}
{"text":"Excellent service only topped by the unbelievable food.  The BEST dining experience for me by far.  There is a reason why Kai has the ratings it does."}
{"text":"Talk about impeccable service. Each person has there own waiter, the food was very creative and the atmosphere romantic. They have your car waiting for you when you leave with little chocolates and bottled waters in your car thanking you. Awesome!"}
{"text":"THE FINEST THE SOUTHWEST HAS TO OFFER. A life-changing culinary and spiritual event. Redefines the southwestern style as the highest-of-high in haute cuisine. An adventure of detail down to the individual salt grains. (That's for the iPhoners... now for the Rest... of the story...)

This review has been percolating in my head for six months, almost to the day. With the recent tighter link between Yelp and Facebook, I realize it is time to promulgate the News that is the New Gospel of Southwestern Cuisine as bestowed on us by Chef O'Dowd. You may have read his praises in the local media these past months. Just one week after I dined there, Mobil granted it five stars -- the only Arizona establishment in any category to have this rating at present, and one of only four restaurants in the USA given the designation this year.

But my introduction to Kai was nothing so grand. It began as a destination to commemorate a friendship I hold dear to my heart and to celebrate her birthday. As is our custom, I called Maitre'D to make several special requests including one for our dessert. It was a night I shall remember for decades to come.

I may say the evening began the moment I crossed the property line and made my sojourn along a mile-long road and through a manicured yet natural presentation of desert flora. When I arrived at the hotel building entrance and stepped out of my car, there was NO ONE anywhere to be found. No bellman, no valet, no guests. The dim light of the entrance welcomed me as I walked into the grand lobby. I could hear a waterfall but there was no one anywhere in sight. Then from nowhere a valet greeted me and took my name. After that introduction, Ritz-Carlton style, every staff person I met knew my name. TRIPLE BING!!

This place celebrates the Story. It provides little spotlit nooks for two, three or more, or even seating in front of a fireplace. And that's just Kai's bar area! We waited over a round of drinks (including a perfectly made Sapphire martini) because we were told that a special table awaited us.

The celebration continued with the most unique and moving presentation of a menu I have ever experienced. Covered in textured rose-fuchsia-colored fabric and inlaid with watercolor from an artist in residence, our captain placed the table candle in front of it and let its flickering shadows on the fabric backlight the story of the land and the history of this property all the way to the selection of locally-grown (yes he pointed in the direction of the gardens) vegetables and herbs. My eyes were welling up as he finished.

Our pour of sparkling water was complimented with our choice of garnish including blood orange and peach among the \"usual\" lemon, lime or cucumber slices.

(getting this out of the way) Sommelier was the only distraction. Clearly not at his best, his bumblings included improper pouring etiquette, coming back to ask which Duckhorn we wanted, Merlot or Chardonnay, leaving the Champagne bottle on the table after the pour, and not refilling our empty wine glasses when checking in on us. UM! 

OK, back to the bliss. Of course we had to order the 12 course tasting menu. Each course was a sublime tapestry of flavor sensations. Even the one-bite Amuse was a symphony of 15, all working in careful harmony. I got to have two courses of fois gras (DOUBLE BING!) and the duck was so perfect, mild and elegant that even the three salt crystals intruded on its divinity. Second time 'round I had no salt. Heaven on earth. (see my profile's last meal preference)

The final blow was our dessert. Although it had the ingredients I requested, it was entirely new. The strawberries had been infused with a candy-like vinegar and must have been several hours in their preparation. The fresh mint with the presentation was merely a garnish; the strawberries were as full of mint as if they had spent their lives in the same soil -- maybe they had! The balsamic was carefully chosen and perfectly matched. Like the perfection in every other detail, small pepper grains lined one side of the rim and dared us to pull them down. The dish's coronation was the creme fraiche executed at the exact moment, seconds before the presentation. Chef had to have stayed all the way to the end to make that execution.

With all my heart I thank Chef for sharing his talent and craft. These few words only vaguely illuminate the wonders that await you at Kai. I hope that you find your way there for a special meal; it'll be one you won't soon forget."}

{"text":"This restaurant is by the far the most unique restaurant I have ever eaten at.  I love the concept...taking the vernacular of southwest, native american flavors and incorporating it into fine cuisine.  The heart of this restuarant is the fact that they use local seeds, local flowers, local everything to make the food so extraordinary.  I always request the corner table at teh junction of the 2 windows at aorund 5:30 pm to get the best sunset views possible.  Then the experience begins...every waiter knows your name, everything is not overlooked, food is beyond exceptional, and the location is classic AZ.  If I could, I would add another diamond on top of the 5 it's already received.  Thank you Kai and Sheraton WHP for putting together an unforgettable restaurant."}

{"text":"I'm sure the food is wonderful, but unfortunately I never even got to taste it and never will. Two weeks in advance, I RESERVED the small private dining room (called their wine room) for 6 people at Kai. My company called to arrange the menu and was told I couldn't use the room even though I had made the reservation. No, not because someone else booked the room, but because their untrained staff booked the room for 6 people and the minimum is 7. ***note, I was still willing to pay the room minimum ($1,500)  which was still more than 7 people would spend.  She then left me a voicemail saying \"we can 'note' your request for the wine room but we can't guarantee it without a contract.\"  When my company notified me of the error, I called the manager myself. She informed me there was a party of 30 in the room next to me and she could not guarantee how quiet they would be (I did not request this from her.) She also informed me that we could not use any electronics or audio visual equipment in the room. I told her I only had an IPad to set on the table. She said I couldn't use it in my PRIVATE room. (Could we not use our phones either?) After a lengthy discussion, I told her I wasn't cancelling my reservation as the dinner was already scheduled with my guests and I would have to follow up with her. She called about an hour later, apologizing for the miscommunication, said she would honor my reservation for 6-7 people, put me in the private room and allow me to use my iPad. She also said she confirmed with my company. I told her they would be in touch to arrange the menu and contract. The day before my dinner she left me a message, \"we did 'note' your request for the wine room and uh we also maintain our smart business casual dress code we don't allow hats T-shirts or shorts for both ladies and gentlemen including open toed shoes for the men and they did receive several phone calls as well as email with a contract to sign and unfortunately I'm not an authorized signer and the only person that can sign such paperwork is the general manager of the entire resort and uh he's been asked to do this one other time and he did not sign the contract so I apologize but thank you for your understanding.  You do have a 'regular' reservation.\"  
-poor employee training
-lack of customer service
-inability to deliver what was agreed

In the end, I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman- plenty of money to spend and the store refusing to help me. 

Should you choose to spend your money here, even if it's not a \"private dining event\" I hope you are treated with more respect than I was. 

However, if you want to be treated like a valued guest, go spend your money elsewhere."}

{"text":"My wife and I dined here for our 10th anniversary.  I was impressed from the moment we arrived at the door.  The staff asked our names, and nobody forgot them the rest of the evening.  We were addressed by our first names, and the service was impeccable, attentive, yet not intrusive.  The food, though, stole the show.  It's everything you've seen on all of the Food Network shows, and then some.  The complexity of the tastes and textures was so varied, and perfect.  The progression of the courses and the pairings with wine were amazing.  I'd go every weekend, but it is quite expensive."}
{"text":"I had one of the best dining experiences of my life at Kai.

It is evident that the chef and the staff put a lot of thought into making every expect of your dining experience perfect. The food is incredibly delicious, the presentation beautiful, and the service is absolutely top notch.

Two examples to illustrate the level of attention to detail:

- One of the dishes I had was an appetizer dish, lobster done three ways, from chilled, to room temperature, to warm. The food itself was INCREDIBLE. I went more than a year ago, so I don't remember a lot of the details, but suffice to say I still dream about that dish. But what I want to highlight here is the utensil that came with the dish. It was chilled, and warmed in your hand at the exact right pace as you worked your way through each of the three preparations. That was mind blowing for me. I've been to plenty of 2- and 3-michelin starred restaurants in different cities in the US, and some would chill the spoon that came with the sorbet palette cleanser. I have yet to experience what I experienced at Kai anywhere else.

- Our car was waiting for us outside of the hotel lobby when we were finished with dinner. Inside we found two bottles of VOSS water, a box of chocolate, and a card from our server thanking us for dining at Kai. 

My friend who dined with me promptly sent a thank-you card back, to both the waiter as well as restaurant management. It was THAT good.

If you live in the Phoenix area, I envy you. :) But, I will probably see you at Kai soon, as I'm perfectly willing to get on a plane, just to eat at Kai."}
{"text":"My bf took me here to celebrate a special occasion and the experience was phenomenal. The dinner was beautiful down to the smallest details. The flowers on the table are lovely, everyone has memorized your names, you leave the table and come back to a new napkin that's been folded and placed in front of you, you can pick from an assortment of exotic fruits to put in your water....I could go on. 

I had the Hal soup, the composition of lobster, the buffalo tenderloin, the dark chocolate orange souffle, and the deconstructed baklava. The soup was good and reminded me of a smoother form of chili. The lobster was delicious and had unexpected components in the dish that made it sing. The buffalo, unfortunately, was just okay. I felt it lacked depth in flavor except for the smokiness of the sauce it came with. But both of the desserts were wonderful, truly. I couldn't decide between the two of them so they brought out both for me. All of the dishes were plated beautifully and had thought and care put into each one.

Also, my bf is a picky eater and he was expecting to have to sit and watch me eat during 3 out of the 4 courses (and we were both okay with this). But the chef made him small amuse bouches for every one of the meals I had ordered so that he wouldn't be left out. The amount of care and time that goes into this restaurant and your dining experience is truly astounding. The quality of service in this restaurant is worth the price alone. It was such a wonderful experience and I hope to come back again."}
{"text":"It is truly a unique and remarkable dining experience. Celebrating our anniversary, we traversed all the way from Peoria and it was worth the trek and definite subsequent visits. I would consider the staff more as guides than waiters. Their knowledge and professionalism exemplified excellence while also maintaining a pleasant friendliness. The food, oh the food. Phenomenal? Orgasmic? Divine? Existing words don't do it justice. The complex layers of flavor in combination proved to be a delightful journey for the palate. A definite must for everyone's  \"Bucket List\"!"}

I think this is by far the best \"special occasion\" restaurant in the Phoenix area. Not as snobby as some of the places in Scottsdale resorts and far better food than Compass downtown. 

We started off at the bar since our table wasn't ready when we arrived. They have a variety of specialty martinis. The \"Great Fruit\" was a good sweet and fruity cocktail and the candied grapefruit slice made it special. I ordered the \"SKOCU THU\" which had a bit of spice to it and was garnished with a dried chili. It sounds weird but it was amazingly good! Definitely one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The bartender also made a smaller sized Mesquite Bean Martini for us to sample which had excellent flavor but I think you have to like Bourbon to truly enjoy it. 

As for the food, the menu is a little different and requires an adventurous palate. I enjoyed the Native American influence and focus on local food. We ordered an appetizer that had cured ham, raw fish, and buffalo tartare, which worked well since it had a variety of items to try and was a good for sharing. There was a small soup included in the meal (just a taster size) and also sorbet to cleanse the palate between courses. My husband ordered the Buffalo as his entree which was a good size and he said it had excellent flavor. I had the Seafood Potpourri which was also excellent though I am not sure how that fits in with their Southwest theme. The only criticism of the menu that I have is that the only poultry item was duck. So, if you are not a game meat or seafood person you would be out of luck. I did appreciate the fact that they had a good selection of half-bottles and wine by the glass because after the martinis we could not have handled a full bottle of wine. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse for dessert and so that was a nice surprise but I think otherwise they still provide truffles as a finish.

I highly recommend Kai as a place you must try at least once, but be prepared to spend some money."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the most incredible dining experiences I've ever had. From beginning to end literally every detail was attended to with the utmost care and perfection. 

We arrived, the valet showed us to the hostess who congratulated us on our anniversary and welcomed us to an impeccable dining room. Our table was quickly approached by serving staff to fill our water glasses and provide us a wine list. We weren't rushed to the food menu but rather assisted by the on site sommelier to select a bottle of wine. Our server introduced us to the concept of the restaurant and he displayed the unique custom menus which each had a watercolor painting telling a story of the surrounding Native American community. 

We selected our dishes with his help and began the experience. From the Starter course, to our three selected courses everything was perfect. The lobster dish was phenomenal and as we were enjoying it the curtains were opened to reveal the most beautiful sunset over the mountains. The main course with duck was absolutely perfect. There's no way to describe the perfection of all the flavors. The wine glasses and water remained full, we were offered fruit to add to our water and a selection of unique breads. Dessert was perfect as well. 

After dessert the staff brought over wet scented towels and a bowel with local plants and dry ice helping to life the perfect smells to your nose. It was a perfect way to end the meal, that and the delicious truffles they brought out. 

When we were ready to go our car was waiting without having to ask, there were two chilled waters, a thank you note and a box of small muffins and local honey waiting in our car as well. 

This was not at all just dinner, this was an experiment and not one I will forget. They earn their 5 diamonds and should be commended for their work."}
{"text":"I had a lovely dinner here.  I had two friendly and attentive servers.  Make a reservation in advance and mind the dress code.  I had the from the garden, buffalo tenderloin and the essence of chocolate dessert.  The desert was my least favorite it was ok.  Everything else was great.  I enjoyed the bread and the amuse bouche (seared elk loin) and the sorbet intermezzo.  I had a couple vermouths and the bill with tip came to $130.  the steak and salad were both excellent.  The bill came with truffles and upon paying valet had already retrieved my vehicle and there were more chocolates, bottle of water, and a thank you note inside."}
{"text":"Happiness 5.5/5 (that's right, it broke the scale)
Deliciousness - 5/5.

Oh my gosh you guys. Ohmygosh! I can't help but add to the insane amount of hype for this place. Kai earns it all, and more.

First, I'm not an elitist snobby guy. Like some of you, I rolled my eyes when reading the reviews calling it an \"experience.\" Well - shame on me. It absolutely lives up to the billing.

The service is top notch. Artistic menus, gorgeous scenery outside of giant picture windows, staff all along the walls, finding a way to meet dietary needs, and then fresh (and free) biscuits and bottled water in my car when we were done (we didn't even have to call the valet, they do it for you). But what makes it an experience, beyond the out-of-this-world service, is that they try to engage all your senses. Calming Native American music. They brought out a basket of herbs that they poured hot tea on that filled (and cleansed) your nose and that activated dry ice to entice your eyes. How's that for an experience?!

I've focused so much on the service, but the food lives up to the rating and the price. The foie gras really is to die for. My wife is pretty \"meh\" about foie gras, and ended up eating more than I did (to my chagrin). They gave us a free dessert and palate cleansers, which was so generous. I had the bison, which was probably the best cuts of bison I've ever had. 

This place is expensive but you get every cent's worth out of it. Highly recommended, even if you only make it there once."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service.  We went for my husband birthday and was beyond impressed. They gave us a private room since I brought my one year old son with us. The experience was long, about 3 hrs for the tasting menu. Totally worth the money. We had one host and 3 servers who made sure our meals all came out at the same time. Every dish was interactive and everything was beautiful. Highly recommend. We would go again."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I gave this 5 star, 5 diamond restaurant a try. I decided to pamper my Father for Father's Day and had a day at Aji Spa followed by dinner at Kai. It was by far the most magical experience I've ever had while dining. My Father is a restaurateur, 30+ years, who is also a chef and a wine maker, so he was completely blown away with the infusion of flavors, the presentation and the remarkable wine list. Special points that they served Portuguese wine, because we are both Portuguese and my Father actually had been to both vineyards that the wine was from. Our wine connoisseur at our table was very knowledgeable and his pronunciation on the grapes and vineyards was on point, remarkable for him not speaking the Portuguese language.  We had an amazing server by the name of Kevin, he really made the experience extra delightful and I cannot wait to return.

The area is quiet and dimly lit, it's perfect for intimate evenings. The portions are small but incredibly filling, believe me when I say I could barely move after the appetizer portion. They explain all of the ingredients to you, and if artwork was food this would be it.

I loves the surprises they throw in at the end, won't tell you what they are but you get two! Make sure to valet your car and they will validate it for you.

Thank you Kai for making a daughter's attempt for the perfect Father's Day a magical dream come true."}
{"text":"I'm about to commit local review heresy and say something negative about Kai.  Not about the food, which was some of the best I've ever had.  The other glowing reviews don't exaggerate about how good the food is.  Nor about the service, which was some of the most attentive I've ever had.  Although...the servers were not experienced enough and a bit immature for a restaurant of this caliber.  They meant well, but looked uncomfortable which made me uncomfortable. 

Kai needs to hear some constructive criticism about the design of their dining rooms and the decor.  

When you arrive you immediately are drawn to the gorgeous views the dining rooms have.  The designer even brought attention to the views by installing floor to ceiling windows.  Unfortunately, the dining rooms are not set up to satisfy diners' needs to see those views.  There are only 4 tables out of maybe 20 that are by the windows.  The rest of the tables are either along a windowless wall or literally in the middle of the room where the fortunate few in those 4 view tables block any chance you have of seeing the view.  The tables in the middle of the room feel like you're in an airport, with all the attentive servers rushing by in a constant stream.  Not very relaxing, and look out if you have to leave the table because you're at high risk of running into a waiter.  Table placement really could use some addressing.

The decor isn't fitting for a 5-star, 5-diamond restaurant.  It's just not pleasing to the eye and way too casual; especially noticeable when the food presentation is so beautiful.  The window treatments framing that gorgeous view look like ultrasuede and are made of three horizontal pieces of fabric in graduated shades of brown, reminiscent of bad Phoenix family room design of 1976.  The other decor doesn't quite work.  For example, there's what is undoubtedly an important piece of woven grass wall art that looks too plain in its surroundings.  The design of the chairs encourages you to slouch down in them and makes it difficult to get close enough to the table to eat comfortably.

Kai is a special place.  I loved, loved, loved my experience there.  Hats off to the chef.  Kudos to the General Manager, but do try to get more experienced wait staff.  Meh to the designer."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and location. My husband had the foie and I had the pork cheeks for appetizers. He had the elk and I had the buffalo tenderloin for mains then we shared the chocolate soufflé for dessert. The foie was outstanding. Crazy attentive service."}
{"text":"The first thing you will notice about this review is that I'm giving the highest rated restaurant in Arizona a 3/5. This place is the only 5 Diamond restaurant in Arizona. That's a pretty heavy distinction to live up to. I can't say they didn't live up to it, but I can't say \"WooHoo\" about my visit either.

I want to point out that this place has what I can only imagine is a true 5 Diamond experience down to a well orchestrated and choreographed science. The menus came with a story - as did the food and everything we consumed. It was a little heavy-handed. Hand-painted menus and live pan flute music playing in the background along with a waiter/narrator/story teller coming to our table every few minutes to be our personal wikipedia for the evening.

The food was good, but this is one of those places that has tiny portions presented on big plates. Most courses were mere bite-sized morsels. Many were complimentary as some of us ordered items with more courses than others. I wouldn't ever again go out of my way for the food here. Nothing spoke to me. In fact, I don't really remember much of what I ate. I know I had a steak at one point. A bone-in rib-eye that had quite a bit of gristle. 

The service was incredible. It was over the top. That was the biggest problem here really. There were four of us dining, and they kept referring to us by our last names - Mr. and Mrs. so and so and Mr. and Miss. such and such and whats her face. It was off-putting enough to all of us that we requested they knock it off. Every time they brought out a drink or a course, there was a brigade of waiters carrying shit. Six people serving four. It was too much. 

I guess I'm just not the type of person who needs that much pampering. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Maybe I need to seek therapy for it - they'll tell me I don't love myself enough and make me cry about my dad because I don't feel like I deserve that kind of service. But seriously, it's overkill. 

This is the sort of think that people with too much money and not enough self-esteem need to do to feel powerful and important. I've heard that sometimes rich billionaire oil barons just shit in the bed instead of going to the bathroom and they have people who clean up after them. They apparently keep these habits when they stay at hotels sometimes as well. 

It just all reminds me of the gap between the super-rich and the rest of us... the elimination of the middle class. 

The whole thing is overpriced if you're not all about every bit of it. You have to like the pampering, the stories, the food, and the special imported drinks. If you appreciate all of that, then you will enjoy yourself. Most of it just made me feel like a pretentious asshole.

For me, I'm happy if you don't spit on my food, make sure I have my refills on my drink, and that you don't seat me next to the bathroom. The food is why I go out to eat - not to have someone serve or entertain me. The food here just wasn't strong enough on its own
 to warrant a return.

I will say this though - the view is amazing and the place is beautiful, tranquil, and classy."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided very last minute to celebrate our 10 year anniversary at the restaurant on July 1.
I should prep this by saying that I've been in the meeting planning business for 9 years, so I've seen numerous resorts. Though I have not done a site inspection at this resort, I knew it was nice, but I have never been more impressed than I was with our entire experience arriving at their location, and dining at Kai. 
Upon our arrival, we were greeted by at least 3 people that wished us a happy Anniversary - from valet, to the door greeters. The view was amazing and I was truly disappointed that I did not bring my camera. The hostess, as well as the gentleman that walked us into the restaurant also wished us a Happy Anniversary and went above and beyond for our service. As this was a completely non-business related event, I was very impressed by all of the details and the care they provided us. I cannot begin to describe how lovely the meal was, and the special chocolate dessert they gave us with the \"Happy Anniversary\" sign on it. The tidbits of information that were shared with us about every detail, from the menu, to the history of the wine, and all of the local information was truly appreciated. 

We had already decided that was probably the best dining experience we had ever had, when we walked out and were given a Thank you card, which completely blew us away even further.

This by far is a 12 out of 10"}
{"text":"To me, giving a 5 star review means that a restaurant has reached the pinnacle of perfection, to which there is no doubt that Kai has attained.

This has become one of our families favorite places to go.  It is a true culinary experience.  We have been here three times and each visit had it's own highlights to make the visit memorable.  The ambience is impeccable; it isn't so much created by the decor but by the people serving you.  From the moment you arrive you are called by your name and treated like you are part of the family.  Every employee is attentive to make sure that you are comfortable and receiving the Kai experience.

Once you are seated you are treated to an explanation of the restaurant and it's vision.  They explain how everything from the menus (printed and placed in mesquite wood that was crafted from a member of the local tribe) to the food has been locally sourced.  You won't run out of options in terms of what your tastebuds may be tingling for as the menu provides a myriad of different options to satisfy your cravings.

Service is impeccable.  Upon our first visit we were actually a little startled when each of us had an attendant.  When your food is prepared they come out in one synchronous ballet to deliver your entrees at precisely the same moment.  

When you leave and get into your car, you are greeted with a thank you card from your server, bottles of Voss water and personalized chocolates from the restaurant.  They really have thought of everything.  If you want to experience the very best that Arizona has to offer look no further than Kai."}
{"text":"Kai is a truly remarkable restaurant experience.  The food is beautiful;  uniquely and expertly prepared.  Service is exceptional, with a highly trained, professional staff.  It unquestionably deserves the Five Star Rating.

Significantly, however, the location bears severe consideration:  it's in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by big box chain stores, and way to far from the urban, city core.  I understand the \"Indian\" vibe that they are trying to create, but the Sheraton represents a contrived, inauthentic effort.  If the restaurant were located near our home, in the Biltmore area, we would be frequent diners there.  We stayed the night at the Sheraton for the sole purpose of avoiding the long drive home. It was fine, but the Sheraton simply does not measure up to the excellence of such a restaurant.  A restaurant of this caliber should be in hotels like The Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental or Peninsula.  

Notwithstanding its ridiculous surroundings and the average, mediocre hotel in which it exits, the restaurant is so good that in spite of all that, it still receives Five Stars in our humble view."}
{"text":"Short Story tasting menu was 5 stars.  6 courses scallop, soup, fish, and amazing buffalo."}
{"text":"A great experience.  The atmosphere(except the mosquitos), the service, presentation and flavor of the food was incredible.  It was the total package.  The journey started upon our arrival and the note and water left in the vehicle are the little things that make an evening memorable.  The story was descriptive and thorough and any questions were welcomed and answered in great detail.  The whole team, from the front of the house , to the kitchen, made the experience unforgettable. If you need an escape, I highly recommend an evening at Kai."}
{"text":"Remarkable foodie experience

I read about Kai in Phoenix Magazine and made reservations for an anniversary dinner for my wife and I. 

It was a tour of exquisite dishes, prepared wonderfully, and coupling in Sonoran Desert ingredients and flavors that are completely novel in everyday cuisine. 

Jeremy was superb in leading the service staff. We were pampered and took occasional moments to enjoy the sunset over the mountains, followed by lightning periodically igniting the clouds as night took over. 

From amuse to the tribal buffalo and duck entrées to the desserts, it's a meal my wife and I agreed we will remember for a long time."}
{"text":"WOW.  We had read alot of reviews about Kai, and they are were positive and we were really beginning to wonder.  It's pretty strange that this place only has positives reviews.  There were a few reviews criticizing the decor, but nothing about the food...

Well, here I am, another positive review.  We were there Saturday night for the Journey with Expanded Wine Lists.   What a journey it was.  Every dish was so unique.  There were Native American ingredients that were incorporated into dishes - but the flavors of 'basic' components were incredible.   So reading the menu is very deceptive, because the dish name may be \"mushrooms\" or \"tomatoes\" but what you get is an experience in your palate and on your plate.

The service was impeccable.  They repeatedly called us by name when they served and came to table to explain or ask things.  It was extremely coordinated and overall a pleasure to experience.

We constantly travel out of state for fine dining experiences, and had no clue that a fine dining experience that rivals Fleur de Lys, Moto was in our backyard!!   It wasn't pretentious, but classy and friendly.

It was a beautiful evening, and we can't wait to go back once the temperatures cool down, since it looks like they have outdoor seating, and the view is spectacular. 

The Sheraton hotel has some issues to work out (we spent the night - had to after all that wine - driving wasn't really an option) but they do make good to resolve their mistakes.."}
{"text":"Full review in the blog, simply not enough room to express my praises here:

...how do you begin to describe a meal at Kai - the only Forbes 5-Diamond restaurant in Arizona and perhaps the only \"fine dining exploration of Native American Culture\" in the world?  Would it be easiest to discuss it as a \"resort restaurant\" where the meal is begun with an offering of citrus selections for the water and silverware is presented temperature appropriate?  Would it make sense to talk about the culinary pedigree of head Chef Michael O'Dowd and his heavy reliance on refined French technique to display the beauty of rarely utilized locally farmed ingredients?  Or perhaps I should start off in the manner that a meal at Kai begins - with a lengthy and informative story about the location, tribe, and inspirations of the meal that will follow.  In reality I think any of the above would be appropriate, but in the end I think the best way to begin is in the mindset of a \"destination\" meal because from start to finish that is precisely what Kai is.

The second course of my meal at Kai would prove to be the single best thing I ate during my visit to the desert - a plate where nearly everything screamed \"heavy and overly complicated\" but a dish where each element added something to the whole with the resultant product even greater than the sum of its parts.  Entitled \"Escargot, Truffles, Wild Mushrooms & Caramel Goat Cheese\" this lovely presentation arrived with a piece of slightly sweetened Native \"French Toast\" at one end and a stew of Burgundy snails, Oregon truffles, and pork belly nuggets at the other.  Teaming with notes of Meyer lemon and black garlic nage plus the sweet acidity of blis vinegar the dish was finally topped tableside with a slowly melting frozen Truffle Crema and dots of Tarragon Oil and Chive Oil that added an aromatic tinge both earthy and herbal that rose to the palate and sinuses melding all the flavors into a truly magnificent dish.

Another highlight reel dish and served at the size of its full a la carte portion the \"Prairie Squab & Spiced Cornmeal Dusted Sweetbreads\" would be quite the generous offering.  Beginning first with the scarlet squab featuring a flawless sear and the hockey-puck sized sweetbread, crispy on the outside and creamy within, both of the proteins on this plate would prove exemplary.  Moving next to the accoutrements - beneath the squab a round of truffled Iberico Lomo Gratinee Potatoes plus Wilted Summer Chard Leaves and under the thymus a dollop of stone fruit & grape Chutney with Truffle Croutons -one sweet and one savory once again, and both complimentary to their respective proteins without being overwhelming.

mMy final dessert would arrive in the hands of a back-server along with a warning of \"be careful, this is very hot\" and indeed it was, the Mexican Chocolate Souffle's ramekin radiating a palpable heat at easily a two foot distance.  Large, tall, proper, and aromatic with notes of cocoa and \"Kai's Sweetened Dry Mole Spices\" the soufflé was subsequently punctured tableside with the addition of a thick and smoky Wattleseed Anglaise and without hesitation I can say that although non-traditional in texture the flavor was outstanding...a sweet meets savory brownie with notes of cinnamon, cumin, pepper, and clove punctuating the chocolate and melding with the Anglaise.  Like the cheesecake this is the sort of dessert I imagined when I requested its addition to my menu and I'd encourage any and all to do the same.

No stranger to fine dining whether stateside or in Paris I will simply state that although some may not appreciate \"resort\" restaurants or the somewhat longwinded ostentatiousness of Kai's presentations there is not a doubt in my mind that this is a restaurant deserving of its 5-star accolades and the sort of restaurant that would invariably garner at least two if not three Michelin Stars if the Red Guide ever came to town.  A refined experience with an exquisitely talented chef preparing ingredients both common and unique in ways that are novel even to the experience diner Kai is not just a restaurant, but truly the exploration of native and local flavors that it sets out to be."}
{"text":"Have been twice here and have never been rushed, that being the reason for lower ratings I've seen here. The presentation does outweigh the food, not by much, but it definitely makes the dinner a special occasion

Jeremy has been my waiter twice and I wouldn't want anyone else"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to celebrate an early valentines dinner. We had the 12 course tasting menu. 'Outstanding' does not describe the experience.  Everyone went out of their way to give us an absolutely amazing evening. Best gastronomical experience in the valley by far. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for over the top fine dining experience..."}
{"text":"5 Stars doesn't even do this place justice, but I suppose that's why it's a 5 DIAMOND restaurant! We came here for my bf's bday on Tues and we still haven't stopped talking about our meal!  He said it was hands down the best meal he's had in his life...and I'm leaning towards agreeing.

Started with the Caviar and Foie app...um, what's NOT to like?
He had the Venison...BEST venison we have ever had...ever
I had the Escargot with Truffles...so nice to see escargot not drowned in garlic butter...love that too, but so refreshing to see a different take.
Shared a fab bottle of Pinot Noir from the Santa Lucia Highlands
Complimentary glasses of Veuve Cliquot and a berry plate (we don't do desserts) in honor of my bf's bday

Service was so phenomenal...really taking the dining experience to the next level.  Absolutely worth the drive out there and cannot wait to go back!

Tip...the views of the mountains are gorgeous!  We're normally not early eaters, but taking the early reservation was worth it to see the fiery skies and the sun sinking down into the mountains."}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Kai restaurant. My bar tender Liberty knew customer service and was absolutely amazing. I recommend seeing her if you're looking to have a drink or two."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. As expected the service was outstanding. We had \"The Journey\". An eleven course spectacular that kept us at the table for 4 hours. You might think that eleven courses and four hours is overkill. But you would be wrong. The service is paced and never rushed. Each serving is small but enough to throughly enjoy each delectable item. If you want an outstanding dining experience, this is your place. The staff went well beyond what you might expect with even high standards. We even got a nice surprise at the valet when we got our car. It was expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Such a sad review to leave. 

Went here for my birthday and brought another couple.

We had Feliciano who is an outstanding server. The service was 5 star, no doubt.

The food. Well, the food fell short.

2 peoples meals had to be sent back. Medium rare steaks came out well. Sent them back and they came back out MEDIUM WELL! Thats unacceptable at a place like this.

Then they brought something out in the interim since 2 people were eating and 2 were just sitting there. The thing they brought out had PLASTIC WRAP in the food. We brought it to the service attention and they felt horrible.

Now, they comped the 2 meals they messed up. Which was nice. But to be honest, financial reparations is not something we were after. It's all about the experience at a place like this.

Maybe we will try again someday but unfortunately Kai has completely missed the mark this time."}
{"text":"This dinner was in everyday one of the best I've had at any restaurant.  The service is exceptionally attentive and prompt. Also they do a great job at anticipating what your needs are and meeting them before you have to ask.  I don't want to give to many details because it'll be even more special when you aren't expecting it.
The theme of the restaurant is very fitting for the locale. They combine ingredients and artistic expressions from the Pima and Maricopa Native American tribes, so being from they east coast this was a new experience for me but very enjoyable.   The meal started out with a creamy soup for our amuse bouche, and then I had the duo duck appetizer (they call it \"the birth\"), which included duck confit and duck foie gras. First impressions are definitely lasting because after those dishes I was very impressed and eagerly anticipating the next course, \"the beginning\".  I had the suckling pig, which didn't disappoint. It was amazingly savory and tender, and it was well complimented with a fig/date side. For \"the journey\" I had the pecan encrusted lamb, and for dessert the chocolate soufflé. Both I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner (7 course tasting menu with the enhanced wine paring).  Went with the tuna but my date substituted for the venison, both of which were excellent. The sommelier really knew what he was doing.  I think aside from the food being beyond wonderful, the best part was at the end my car was pulled up front, keys in the ignition with a thank you note on the dash and two bottles of water.   Really nice touch.  I don't think I'll ever go somewhere as delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best meal I've ever had in my life.   Also hands down the most expensive, but the experience, the flavors, the service, all worth every penny.  

Kai blends a Native American base theme with locally grown and locally sourced ingredients to create dishes that are simply out of this world.    The Lobster Degustation we started with was sublime.  The menu describes it as three items,  \"Butter Braised Tail, Avocado Mousse, Tear Drop Salsa & Lobster Coral Lobster Knuckles in Sweet Corn Panna Cotta with Sour Radishes, Lobster Cobbler with Mesquite Meal & Burnt Irish Porter Cheese\".  I describe it as simply ridiculous in its enjoyability.

I had a Buffalo steak which was very lean yet incredibly tender.  My wife had the Ribeye steak, which was borderline too fatty, but the flavor and texture were outstanding.  The house-made barbecue sauce should be bottled and sold.

My dessert was the \"Two Sisters Squash Air Cake\", with \"60-Day Corn Ice Cream, Mesquite Syrup, Smoked Corn Puree, Ramona Farms Ga'Ivsa, Tarragon and Amaranth\".  What the menu doesn't say is the dish is delivered under a bell filled with Applewood smoke.   Wow.  Unexpected, and exceptionally different.  

Make no mistake:  Dining here is an investment in time and money.   It is not inexpensive in any way shape or form.  But if you're willing to invest in flavors and textures and service you're not likely to experience in many places, and certainly not anywhere else here in the Valley, then make a reservation and be prepared to be awestruck."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Everything, absolutely everything, was impeccable.  We dined in a private room with a party of about 20 and were impressed with the details, the quality of the service, and the food.

First off, the wait staff is well trained and even has personality.  Imagine that!  They often set down plates in synchrony or picked things up in synchrony.  My wine glass never got too low and everything from the amuse to the dessert was very tasty.  

I had:

Salad inspired by Local Farmers- 4 stars
Rib Eye steak, medium rare- 4 stars- a little fatty but they always are!
Chocolate Three Ways, dessert- 5 stars

Service- 5 stars
Wine- 5 stars
Atmosphere- 5 stars

What a lovely experience.  Exactly what a fine dining event should feel like, without the pretentiousness and snobbish attitude one often encounters in \"nice\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Kai is truly a five star restaurant, and best in class in the valley for service.  I have to first address that some of the posts stating the decor does not feel 5 star.  I think with restaurants and the New American, Modern Cruise we expect the establishment to be hip and modern.

I think Kai is understated, it complements the food and the mood of the hotel.  The backdrop is a Native American resort in which Kai pulls their flavors.  The table clothes although a pale peachy pink of the desert, look closer and there thick silk.  I did not feel as though my table was to close to another diner.  More than often now in the ultra cool mod restaurants you are on top of your neighbor on a long bench.

Anyway, back to the food.  My boyfriend and I - which are self proclaimed foodies, went all out with the Journey with Expanded Wine List.  The way to go for the first timer.  Amazing, I cannot say enough.  My next visit I do plan to order directly from the menu.  However, in anyway restaurant I am a firm believer in getting the tasting menu is generally getting the best

All the dishes incorporate Native American cuisine, the grain, corn and tomato perfectly combined.  What I did find interesting in the wine list, was a cheese course of two different cheeses accompanied by two different beers.  Although not a beer drinker I appetite the cleverness.

As you are rolling yourself back to your hotel room, trying to remember all those courses and flavors, you approach the hotel room door and there lies a Thank you note with all the memories on paper for you."}
{"text":"Stellar 5 star service meets exciting, unique, and artfully presented dishes in a posh mountain resort overlooking a gorgeous mountain range. Let your stress melt away while experiencing the 4 hour long \"Journey\". This is one of those restaurants where after every dish you say \"I wish I had one more bite of that\"! In my opinion, scratch the wine and enjoy the bartenders wildly delicious creations. Be careful- the bread baskets feature the best assortment of breads you'll find and they will serve you as much as you can desire- which in my case was 3 baskets . I should have instead been patient and saved a little extra room for what was to come. Even after nearly 4 hours, we still had to take 3 dishes to go- and they were just as incredible after-the-fact). An amazing experience in an incredible atmosphere."}

While not strictly native american (e.g. had lobster and caviar as ingredients), all the dishes and drinks had elements or ingredients that were locally based. The decor is based on traditional native american design and all the menus have hand painted pictures depicting some element of native american life. Our servers were excellent. They were knowledgeable about the different dishes and gave us cultural background throughout the night. We were also blown away to find a box of chocolates, fancy water, and a hand written card from our server in our car when we picked it up from valet."}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by the service and the food at Kai.  From the moment we walked through the door I felt as though we were getting the kind of personalized service that made us feel like we were the only diners in the restaurant.  We came in to celebrate our elopement which happened earlier in the week and could not have been more excited to start this experience!

First the decor is elegant but not over the top.  The view of the sunset over the mountains was breathtaking.  They opened the curtains at just the right time not to blind you while its setting but as soon as it passes over the mountains and the sky is illuminated with pinks and purples that only look real in paintings.

The staff always greets your by name and takes the time to take you though the history of the land and how it ties into the decor and the cuisine.  Each menu is adorned with a unique water color that represents the local tribe.

We ordered one appetizer, the lobster 3 ways.  It was magnificent.  Each uniquely delectable.  They then surprised us with 2 additional appetizers compliments of the house.  One was the escargot and the other was the rabbit and foie gras.  To say that we were overwhelmed with these delicious plates is an understatement.

We ordered 2 main courses, the buffalo and the elk.  I've never in my life tasted something so amazing.  The elk meat was tender and flavorful and accompanied with a delicious risotto.  They then shaved fresh black truffle over my plate.  I was in heaven.  My husband had the buffalo and again the flavors and tenderness of the meat were just amazing. It had crumbled chorizo as well as a small salad. 

The chocolate soufflé was decadent.  Although I was too full to continue, there was no way that I could pass this up.  It was everything and more.

As if the night couldn't get any better, upon getting into our car, we received a lovely hand written note form our server along with muffins and jam as well as a box of chocolates.  I wish I could give this review 10 stars because I walked out of there having the best culinary experience of my life.  

Hats off to the chef and staff and Kai.  You know how to make your patrons feel special."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here at first due to pricing. The experience and food was worth every cent. I 100% encourage everyone to try the chefs tasting menus. And I hope you get Kevin. I'm not an escargot fan but the chef does a spin that is unforgettable! And try the buffalo!
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Decided to take the drive out to Kai and try out what many consider the best restaurant in in the State.

We arrived a little early for our 9pm reservation and were greeted first by the valet, then by the 2 hostesses at the entrance. We requested a window table, popped into the bar for a couple of very interesting and delicious cocktails, and were promptly seated at our requested window table. 

We thought it was really weird that they assumed my date and I were married by calling us Mr. and Misses (insert last name here) - this happened all throughout the evening, despite the fact that neither of us were wearing wedding rings. We never bothered to correct them but we both thought it was unusual to make such an assumption.

DECORE: After reading so many negative reviews of the decore, I had been prepared for the worst. It did have a \"cafeteria like\" feel to it, but overall not as bad as I expected after reading the reviews. Probably helped we were placed next to the window in one of the few window tables available.

SERVICE: The service was absolutely outstanding. At least 3 Native American waiters doting on your every need, ever present yet not intrusive. Our waiter took the time to explain the philosophy of the restaurant, it's history and ingredients.

At the end of the day we're really here to EAT - after studying the two tasting menus we decided that the mains and appetizers of the tasting menu were probably the best bet for a-la-carte so we started with the tomato gazpacho and a lump crab appetizer. We preferred the lump crab concoction to the gazpacho.

Second course- we had the escargot, mushroom and caramel goat cheese. Totally about 4 escargots here, not a lot of food, but very tasty with the escargot's cooked to a perfect texture.

For the mains she had the butter basted Potpourri of lobster/scallops/shrimp over a black squid pasta. This was delicious but small from a portion standpoint.

I had, of course, the Tenderloin of Tribal buffalo- now I'm not sure how many buffalo are running around on the tribe these days so I would guess that's a stretch. What I can say is it was tender, delicious, not too gamey. Probably about 8oz in total.

VALET: It was VERY cool to see my car already waiting at the valet, with chocolates and waters in the car. Great service.

BOTTOM LINE: Been there, done it, not sure if I will be back. Total check was $270 including a $65 bottle of Cotes Du Rhone"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Some of the best food we've ever eaten. Each ingredient seems thoughtfully chosen and cooked to perfection. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Bar none, Kai is the best restaurant in Arizona, if not one of the best I have ever been. I've had the pleasure to dine here on three occasions, with the last somehow topping my first two unbelievable experiences. Though it will put a nice dent in your wallet, Kai is worth every penny. And then some. This past visit, I had the rare opportunity to try their 13 course dinner with wine pairings.

Kai expertly fuses together Native American and French Cuisines. It is not something you'd expect to work together, but with every dish unveiled, the food ceases to amaze. You'll tend to see the Native American influence with the meats and the ambiance, while the French component can be seen in the flavors and the service.  

Even within the first few minutes of dining, Kai manages to impress. Somehow, the greeter welcomed me with, \"Good evening Mr. Pachence\". I'm not sure how they knew my name before I even said a word. Once I was seated, the staff laid out the napkins in unison and provided the menus. As I've learned from my previous experiences, each menu has a unique hand-painted piece of art. The last two times, the waiter described the artwork along with the underlying story. I was only slightly disappointed that this wasn't enacted this time around, but it only makes sense since my dining excursion was already allotted for about three hours.

It's worth taking the time to call out the exquisite service. I had found out only a month before this past visit that Kai ranked #1 on OpenTable's 2012-2013 list of best service in the States. Had I not read that, I still would have put it at the top of the best service I've ever had from a restaurant. Their top-tier French service includes wait staff that fold your napkins when you leave for the bathroom. They reveal and take away the table's dishes all in unison. They absolutely cater to you, hand and foot. Everything is brought out at the perfect temperature, even the silverware! The forks are either chilled or heated, depending on the dish you receive.

Take for example, my second experience. I was with a group of four. At one point, the staff forgot to bring out a wine pairing with one of the dishes. They were the ones to point out later that a mistake was made, which they made up for by bringing a complimentary appetizer, paired wine, and a free dessert for the table at the end. Now that is service!

The meal itself was nothing less than a piece of art. The food was glittered with both style and substance. Out of the thirteen courses, it's pretty tough to choose the highlights, since everything was so very special. The miniature sous-vide vegetables (4th course), foie gras (5th course), escargot (9th course) and the buffalo tenderloin (11th course) stood out as the best. I've never been a fan of escargot, but the truffle crema and pork belly pieces made the dish so incredibly special that it may have permanently changed my mind on escargot. The buffalo was smokey and tender, with a sweet tinge that that came from the Saguaro blossom syrup.

Across all of the dishes, mushrooms seemed to be the theme of the night with five of the courses highlighted by various types. What is really impressive is that non of the mushroom types were reused throughout the dishes. I left the meal a little overstuffed, but undoubtedly happy. How could I not, after leaving what I would consider as one of top ten meals ever.

Kai is as good as it gets.

{"text":"I'll get right to it!! This is one of the best meals I've had in my entire life, period! The service (I had Feliciano), the food, atmosphere, etc. It's as good as it comes! I've eaten at great places all over and this is at the top!! Details- I had the chefs choice menu. My wife had the escargot and the wild boar. The escargot was the best appetizer I've EVER had. We loved everything we ate. It's pricey but it should be. Once again, absolutely AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING! best experience I have had in any restaurant! service is outstanding and having a gluten allergy was no problem for the chef! A upscale, pricey restaurant that is definitely worth the drive! Will recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a memorable way to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or any other special event and are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars per person, stop looking for a restaurant and book your reservation here!

This restaurant is absolutely spectacular! A fine dining experience unlike anything else I have ever experienced!

The entire staff ensures that ever detail of your entire dining experience is flawless.

My wife and I celebrated her birthday here and I can't think of any restaurant we have been to in the world that I would rather return to for future special events. Aside from the service, the food is also a revelation with every bite of every dish being one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!

I won't list everything we ordered, but whatever you do, don't miss the Potato soup (forgive me for not remembering the fancy name) or the escargot! I really love that each dish is described for you as it is being placed in front of you, so you are never left wondering, \"what was that small thing on the side I just ate?\"

After an amazing meal, I love that our server chose our deserts for us based on what we had ordered for our other courses! Through conversation and our discussions about the other dishes, they made perfect selections for my wife (the chocolate mousse) and for me, an incredible smoked pecan pie that they serve under a dome, releasing a huge puff of hickory smoke right at your table to inhale and start the dish!

I won't share all the small details of how they turn a fine dining experience into a memorable evening as I think that for those not accustomed to truly fine dining, the small details they pay attention to are more enjoyable if they come as a surprise.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's not the only 5 star restaurant in AZ. for nothing! I would advise to defintely bring and open mind, your best manners and an entire paycheck. (Our bill was over $600) I had the steak because I was afraid to try buffalo. Everything that touched your mouth was amazing though. We had a lobster appetizer, I also had goats meat which was strange, unusual but delicious. All this with a bottle, or 2 or 3, of Morgan Double L Pinot and then some chocolate mousse and more wine at the end! The food was amazing but the service is unparalled and I have been to some extraordinary restaurants. The flow of the service went from the hostess, to the Sommelier, to the waiters (uh, 3 per table?) and just extended to all aspects of the entire experience. We were greeted at the end of the evening by the valet who had left a hand written note and a box of custom Kai chocolates on the dash of our car thanking us for our business. I mean if that's not class and superb customer service, I couldn't tell you what is."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my birthday.  First let me say this, the service in this place is impeccable.  I've had very few establishments serve me in such fashion and I would be surprised if an establishment could top the quality of the service in Kai.  

Off the bat, i'm giving this a 4 because I wasn't thrilled with the food that I had.

I would recommend arriving about 45 mins before your \"just before sunset\" reservation so you can sit in the lounge area outside of the entrance to the restaurant and have one of the original, creative cocktails.  Wow, what flavorful and different cockatails!  

Make your reservation for \"just before sunset\" so that you can stare loving at the beauty that the dessert has to offer at the right hour where the earth glows from the beautiful oranges and reds from the setting sun.

I would also recommend, if you are not staying over night, to plan to stay 45 mins after dinner to walk around the hotel terrace area.   

I will update more...."}
{"text":"We tried two upscale restaurants during our stay in Scottsdale: Kai and Cafe Monarch. Kai was head and shoulders above Cafe Monarch and well worth the trip. Living in Chicago we've experienced some fabulous restaurants, Alinea etc, and Kai is at that level. Service is attentive and friendly and the food is so beautiful and delicious. The little extra touches are what really make this restaurant stand out..like the bowl of desert scents, you won't forget it! I can't recommend this restaurant enough. Here's to many more years of success!"}
