{"text":"Excellent Afgani bbq. For those that have never had Afgani cuisine, its sort of half greek/half indian mixed together. DELICIOUS! service is slow because everything is fresh so be patient- its worth it."}
{"text":"Visited here on Saturday, March 11th, and the restaurant appeared to be out of business. There was a sign for \"Frog & Crown Bar and Restaurant opening soon\". Also tried calling the number on their web page and it's out of service."}
{"text":"Good service and tasty food. They just opened recently. If you really want to try a different cuisine you should go there. I would have liked more choices, but the menu is really interesting as it is.  I went for langmen noodles and kebab and wasn't disappointed. The noodles are homemade while the kebab have an authentic flavour. One of of my favourite restaurants in Toronto despite being far from downtown."}
{"text":"This place was recommend by our friend. We tried Big plate chicken, Samsa (baked lamb pies), and Skewered boneless lamb chunks.  Skewered boneless lamb chunks is one of the best in Toronto.  I think this is the only restaurant has Baked lamb pies in GTA. The lamb is a little bit dry, but still tastes great. After all, we can only find this specific dish in Xinjiang, China. Now we have it in Toronto. You gotta try!  Big plate chicken was spicy. Don't challenge yourself to eat those chilies... No doubts, it's  delicious, but the noodles are too thick. We like the big plate chicken at Charcoal Kebab House more...  It's a huge size restaurant. If you are planning a big group dinner, it might be an good option."}
