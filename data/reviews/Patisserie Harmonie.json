{"text":"Great, classic Asian bakery! Prices are amazingly cheap and the shop is clean. 

My favourites: the pastry with the orange crusted top and coconut marzipan-esque filling. The sesame ball filled with red bean is also really great."}
{"text":"Chinese bakery in the middle of Montreal's Chinatown.   Not bad,  but nothing new or exciting in here.   

Coming from the GTA,  I guess I have been spoiled with all the good bakeries in the area. 

Place is small but the smell of fresh baked goods was pretty good.  Couldn't help but to purchase a few little treats and some bubble tea.   Lol"}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing. My  friends and I smelled the fresh baked goods down the block and had to buy some. I had the red bean paste pastry and my friends had the ones with the hot dogs and another one with the custard filling. Almost everything was between CA$1.50-$2.00 which makes it very cheap in USD. We loved the whole Chinatown atmosphere and even returned to this bakery right before heading on the road back to the US to spend any extra money we had. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a sweet(or salty) snack!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for cute food. And the steamed buns are definitely good. They were also yummy.  Place also serves congee, rice rolls, and other dim sum items that we didn't get to try. Hong Kong style tea was on point."}
{"text":"We went there for some buns and bubble tea. Firstly, they do not take credit cards (they do take debit) except I am from the U.S. and had limited Canadian dollars. They said they will take USD but at a 1 to 1 ratio - a 25% rip-off!! We ordered the strawberry mango smoothie which was too sweet from the mango syrup. The honey dew smoothie was standard. The pork bun didn't have much pork - took at least 5 bites into it before discovering a little meat. Haven't had the pineapple bun yet, but the top pastry crust is quite orange, possibly food coloring. Service was not friendly, not surprised. Finally the line to get your bubble tea was chaotic. Not impressed."}
{"text":"5 stars for their egg custard filled mochi pancake shaped \"buns\" (they also come filled with bean paste). They're $1, warm, and delicious, and had us making special stops just to buy them.

Minus one star only because the place was so small and I wished they had a few tables to sit at inside and enjoy my bun. In the winter, munching away outside is a cold endeavor."}
{"text":"Buns taste ok for a Chinese bakery(ie full of artificial ingredients) , but you have to be prepared to be abused. We got there just after opening since we were leaving town that day. The items on display had no signs. Asking the workers what the items were was met with shouting and screaming. Maybe because my gf is Chinese they had no patience with her. When she told me what happened I wished we had walked out. Also they won't take a credit card but accept US dollars at par, nice little scam."}
{"text":"Overall reasonable set up. Concept is a dime a dozen on this stretch of Montreal's Chinatown. We stopped in early AM on a sunday and grabbed a few buns and bubble tea to get the bridal party through our hair and makeup. 

Food was reasonable but experience otherwise was less than appealing. They didn't take credit cards unless it was \"local\" and when we went to pay for our $20.45 bill, fortunately my friend had a $20 dollar bill (American) we didn't have 45 cents, we just didn't but with the dollar 1.3 exchange rate... You do the math. We were fine taking the nearly $6 hit but they weren't ok with us not having 45 cents?? Unreal. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I was getting coconut bubble teas here without the bubbles so the price was good for the very high quality I was served. Excellent desserts me and my gf would walk down here after meals on our vacation"}
{"text":"Mmm. Two words.  Egg Tarts.  

Delicious! Flakey, buttery, soft pastry.  Way better than what I've had in NYC. And cheap! 2 for $1!  

Also got some bubble tea.  It was a bit sweet, but still good. It's on par with NYC bubble tea, I'd say."}
{"text":"I loved seeing the pretty Hello Kitty & Keroppi bao. I was definitely most disappointed in the very bland but visually appealing tuna salad soufflé-ish bun. The rest were incredible though (in terms of freshness/cushiness)! The buns were still warm when we purchased them & the establishment was packed. Cannot say whether the Easter weekend panic or the flawless baking skills of the staff were to blame. The BBQ pork bun was absolutely delicious with generous chunks of meat, the sachima was fantastically crunchy with the right amount of sticky sugary goo & I loved the sweet cream cheese bun that was larger/plainer/flatter-looking than the rest. However, the coconut cocktail is my ultimate favorite every single time. Would very highly recommend & revisit on my next trip to Montréal."}
{"text":"I'm no expert in Asian bakeries, but it's great here. Red bean paste is great. Easy in and easy out."}
{"text":"This small bakery in Chinatown has been a hit with my friends and I since it's opening several years ago.  It's brightly coloured décor, delish looking pastries, and easy to read sign invites roaming visitors inside to relish in a host of delights.  The first thing I noticed upon entering was that all the foods were clearly labeled with both their Chinese and English names, as well as a clearly displayed price.  This is a nice change from most of the other Asian bakeries that I've visited in Montreal, where I never quite know what I'm getting.  

My favorites include the Japanese cheese bun, barbeque pork bun, curry beef bun, red bean mochi, red bean pancakes, coconut cream bun, cheesecake and the egg custards.  The red bean mochi is a wonderful balance of chewy sweetness, perfectly suited for an after-dinner snack.  The egg custards are a lush, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth treat; I've not found better in Montreal.   The savory buns consist of slightly sweet dough enveloping a generous portion of meat.   They are filling and at the high price of $1.25 apiece, make a great lunch for those on a tight budget.  

My current top pick is the Japanese cheese bun.  Sweet dough, similar to that used for the custard buns is wrapped around a filling reminiscent of ricotta cheesecake.   The filling is thick and velvety but not overly sweet, perfectly complementing it's packaging; this combination is a delightful treat at any time of the day.  

Overall, Patisserie Harmonie is a rare gem in a city lacking superior Asian cuisine.   The pastries are fresh, cheap, and most importantly, delicious.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a well-priced lunch, afternoon snack, or late-night craving."}
{"text":"My arteries will not thank me for visiting Harmonie countless times over the years. Even now that I do not live permanently in Montreal, this bakery becomes a must-do appointment whenever I am in Chinatown. 

Harmonie has an outstanding selection of buns to suit every taste. The sweet ones revolve around red bean, taro, coconut and custard. The savoury ones are mostly pork and some beef, though I rarely go that way anyway.

Ladies, gentlemen: one word: TONGS. Use them! Unless you are picking up pre-packed items from the center counter or the fridge, do not touch what's about to become my food.

My staple diet at Harmonie consists of coconut whipped cream buns, mochis, green tea sponge cake and at least one taro bun. If you are having more than just a dessert on-the-go, it's worth getting some more buns and asking for a box at the cashier. With a smile and the dexterity of a magician, your full tray is boxed and bagged before you can say \"yum\". 

Proving the virtuous circle theory, Harmonie has such a high throughput they can afford to charge almost nothing for awesomely-baked goodness, which means they attract more customers, which means they have a high throughput; bake for 30 minutes, taste, repeat.

I fed, filling up for good, a 3-person office and a 2-person family for $12.75. It is absurdly cheaper than celery, and certainly more pleasant to eat.

The bubble tea selection (enormous with endless customizations) deserves an honourable mention. I always go for the less sweet ones, and could even recommend the just-green-tea version - your blood vessels might thank you in the future. In the meantime, please do check this place out.

Oh, yes: CASH  ONLY."}
{"text":"One of the things I enjoy the most in Chinatowns (which is so disappointingly lacking in my own) is walking into bakeries and marveling at all the yummy pastries, cakes, and savory buns.  No matter how full I am, I always buy at least two, eating one immediately (since I can't resist the temptation) and saving one for later.  

After two days of intense competition with 200 other dragon boat teams, this shop was a sight for sore eyes!  As actual candy stores do nothing for me, I imagine people's excitement for candy stores rival mine for Cantonese bakeries.  After much indecision, I settled on a Chinese BBQ pork bun (char siu bao), a custard-filled pineapple bun (bo lo bao), and two egg custard tarts (dan tak--a favorite since childhood).  I generally judge Cantonese bakeries by their egg custard tarts and the ones here are among top eight I've had in North America.  Before running out of the store to catch my teammates, I took a moment to admire the array of exquisite and delicious Asian cakes on display (see photos!).  My only disappointment was I couldn't buy one and take it home!

The next day while we were driving back in the car, I remembered I still had a bun in my bag.  Though it was not warm, the pineapple custard bun kept its texture and tasted fresh and yummy and made a nice lunch.  As we drove home across the border, I happily savored a little piece of home, and of Montreal."}
{"text":"So many yummy things to admire and eat, so little time!  If I had run into this place earlier in my trip, I would have come back every day.

The dough they use for their buns is the most delicious that I've ever had.  And, the black sesame mochi and the green tea sponge cake were delightful.  I also had a honeydew milk bubble tea that was to die for.  

For the things I didn't eat, I wish I could have.  All the cakes, pastries, and buns are so beautifully made that it makes you automatically think, \"Eat that\".  If they had a cyanide mochi, I would probably try it.

Definitely stop at Harmonie when you are in Montreal.  You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Wow! Agréablement surprise par cette patisserie. Ce n'est vraiment pas cher et c'est délicieux! J'ai pris un croissant au amande et la portion de pâte d'amande a l'intérieur est très généreuse. C'est ma nouvelle patisserie préférer sans aucun doute!"}
{"text":"How to get food here:
1. Get a tray
2. Put what you like/looks good on your tray,
3. Go to the cash register and pay

Simple. I like it because you can get a small snack or a buy a full out meal. They had good variety on the three different evenings we went to pickup some food despite being busy each evening. The only thing they could do to improve would be to have somewhere to sit down and eat there, however that would cut into their reasonable prices, so probably for the best."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean. Small bakery.  Warm buns. Enough variety. Slightly expensive (compared to CA). Overall, I'm glad I've stopped by. I haven't had these for sooo long."}
{"text":"I have found that there are not as many pastries to choose from at this shop, than some of the other shops on the block.  But, I do think that the bubble tea here is better than the other bakeries.  My favorite is the Grapefruit Green Tea.  

Other than that, the staff here was kind of rude to me- like they did not want me to be there in the first place.   That was off-putting."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad.  It's got nothing on what you'd find in TO and other cities with larger Chinese communities.

The food is cheap and it's a good way to stock up if you want some cheap eats throughout the days.  It doesn't just have sweets!  You can get buns filled with meats...man that sounded dirty.  Anyways, you can load up almost a days worth of food for around $10 and allow you to stroll through MTL until dinner or later"}
{"text":"Got an egg tart. It was awesome. They also broke a 50 for me which was really nice of them! Will be back again tomorrow for breakfast."}
{"text":"Some of the cheapest and high quality Chinese pastries I've had in my life. Walk in, grab a tray with wax paper and tongs, and feast away. You really can't go wrong whether you try a sweet bun, like black sesame (one of my faves), coconut, custard; or a savory bun, like BBQ pork. Seriously, none of the buns I've eaten here have been bad. NONE. 

Things to know: Make sure you choose the savory buns that come out of the hot oven for best freshness. Also keep in mind if you arrive right at opening time 9AM, there is not much selection of fresh pastries yet, but later in the day actually ain't bad. Prices are between $1.50-$2.00 for just about everything. At checkout you may receive your pastries in individual bags or a box. Cash or CDN debit accepted here so beware."}
{"text":"I love Chinese buns and this is where I get my cravings out!
This place has a very good assortment of baked goods. Very reasonable priced, clean shop and the staff is very friendly and hepful. They are also open until late at night, that's a plus to me.
The Chinatown in Montreal is rather small, if you are comparing to other cities in the world, but here I would say this is the best Asian bakery of Montreal's Chinatown.

If you go on Sundays afternoons you might not get the same variety or freshness on the baked goods."}
{"text":"Well it is the best Harmonie Bakery I've been to (the others are located at Atwater and Concordia). The buns are not overcooked or burnt like other places, and most of them are just out of the oven in the past few hours.

The only downside is that they only accept cash, and the place is really too small to fit so many hungry people looking for baked goods."}
{"text":"This Chinese bakery right by the Montreal convention center saved our lives with freshly baked pork buns, warm Portuguese and Chinese egg tarts, and crunchy almond cookies. 

They have lots of options, and almost everything was under 2$ CAD!"}
{"text":"Love this place and every time I got to Chinatown I have to stop there for a few treats and a bubble tea.

Everything there is so good and also very cheap. They have sweet and salty pasties and so many different flavors of bubble tea.

The line is big at time but it is worth the way and they do take the bank card now...5$ min"}
{"text":"This place has got it going on! Before I describe the food though, heads up about a weird practice: when we went to pay (with our Visa and Mastercard debit cards ), the lady said they only take local debit cards, or cash. I don't get it. I grumbled for a few minutes, but ultimately, we found a couple ATM's directly across the street. 
Ok, back to happiness. This place is a well-oiled machine, with a wonderful variety of baked treasures! They have about 8 different warm options, with egg, sausages, etc. They have countless other options too. All of them looked great! 
We had a warm tuna bun, some crunchy  sesame balls, a toasty cheese loaf, and an almond  cookie. My sweetie also had coffee, and said it was good. Everything hit the spot! Oh, it was all easy on the wallet too!
These guys are fast and orgnized. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The dan tat (egg tarts) are sitting on a hot dish so it's creamy, hot with a crispy, buttery pastry shell.  So divine.  Their almond croissant is surprisingly fresh, tasty but not too sweet.  Black sesame bun, curry beef bun and sausage buns were all delicious."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for 5 days and came here 4 times. That should tell you how amazing it is here. Every single thing I had was perfectly flavored. You pick up a tray and go around with tongs picking up what you want, and then you take it to the cashier who totals it up. The prices here are phenomenal, each time I left with a bag full of goodies for less than $10."}
{"text":"Love this place and its great assortment of pastries! This pastry shop rivals the ones I've been to in various Chinatowns. My friends and I purchased a large variety of pastries for our trip home to Boston. My friend even purchased extra pastries to overnight-ship to her family in Utah, knowing that they would love them. The character buns were the cutest thing!"}
{"text":"EGG TARTS, EGG TARTS, EGG TARTTTTS! 

This place makes one of the best egg tarts I have ever ate in my life! Being asian and all, believe me.. I've had many in my life.  BUT, mannnnn OHHHHHHH MANNNNNN... can they make one flaky, scrumptious egg tart, not to mention.. when you eat it while it's hot, it's just so heavenly! 

I strongly recommend this venue for their egg tarts, they sell out fast, but they are always quick on restocking the tray. Although, it's pretty expensive for egg tarts ( 2 for $1), it's well worth it; not to forget, it's bigger then most places! 

Aside from their egg tarts, I didn't have the opportunity to try anything else, but I am for sure a official fan of their egg tarts !"}
{"text":"Delicious dessert, savoury cakes and buns!!! Great prices!

The last time I ate at a bakery like this was in NYC's China town! I must say - this place brought me back to NYC. The food was spot on. I wanted to try everything in the store!!!! 

They have this braided coconut sweet bread! It is to die for!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in the area I have to go here to get something! This place serves some of the best snacks. I normally go for the steamed or baked BBQ pork buns. I would recommend them to anyone. They are a must try."}
{"text":"I was upset that I lived in Montreal because I could not get Chinese egg tarts anymore.  Until I found this place!  The best Chinese bakery in Montreal is definitely Patisserie Harmonie.  The place although small, has a huge selection of buns, sweets and even serves bubble tea and dessert drinks!  They also have a massive selection of cakes baked fresh daily along with single slices if you're looking to party alone!

The service is great here and the employees often tell you about the specials they have in store.  I also have come across many situations in the evenings when I go after work, and the employees just end up giving me free buns because they are closing for the day.  You don't get that kind of service at most Chinese bakeries!

Overall I'm so glad I found this place as they filled that Chinese bakery void in my stomach in Montreal.  I'll keep coming back here, the have great buns!"}
{"text":"Cheap, filling and tasty buns and pastries.

My favorite is the beef curry bun. Delicious.

The melon bun isn't bad, but their salty buns are better.

I think I tried the fish one most recently and it was surprisingly good!

Harmonie is a chain, BTW, there's another one at the Guy exit of Guy Concordia metro and one in Alexis Nihon near the Atwater metro entrance.

Quality is identical across locations, in terms of value for money, these guys have it spot on.

Highly recommended, safe bet."}
{"text":"I wish there could be a -5 star rating. We are two students from New York buying bubble tea from this bakery. We wanted to exchange some USD to CAD for tips for further uses. The lady at cashier told us we could not use visa to pay for our tea and we did not have any cash CAD. Then she told us that we can pay in USD. We thought she would convert the currency to match the price, but she didn't. She used 1:1 currency ratio which really should be 1USD :0.7CAD!!! We did not realize it until I checked the change later in another store. 
I would never go in that store again, and I just want to tell you that the people there are not very honest and trustworthy!!!"}
{"text":"During our short stay in Montreal we went here every single day. I'm not kidding. Every. Single. Day. Pineapple buns are one of my favorite things and their buns were spectacular. They achieved the right flavor, which is often hard to come by, and they were slightly doughy. Now some people might not like doughy baked goods, but for me that's the best kind. Over several visits we tried many things, of course the pineapple buns were the best, but almost everything we tried was exceptional. The only mediocre sweets were the mochi. Many had a sugar, coconut and peanut filling, which was dry, messy and frankly a bit off putting. Definitely skip the mochi, but try everything else."}
{"text":"Une partie de ma famille est d'origine asiatique. Ils ne sont pas reconnus pour avoir la dent sucrée. J'étais curieuse de visiter cette pâtisserie. J'ai bien aimé les pâtisseries fourrées de garnitures salées ou sucrées, mon gâteau au fromage et mangues les Bubble tea.

Une belle découverte"}
{"text":"Cheap, decent food, well presented and clean.  Can't complain!  Great for a snack if you want to try something different (assuming that you're like me and don't have Chinese pastries as an every-day food)."}
{"text":"Went in on a fluke & found the unique black sesame bun & even more amazing almond milk tea! I'm Taiwanese so I know my milk teas & this was life changing!"}
{"text":"I love the steamed buns animal shapes. They are simply adorable. The filling are sweet (chocolate, cream, mango, coconut, sweet potato, bean paste, black sesame, taro, green tea). There are breads and pastries displayed by the window but those in the counter near the cash register are freshly steamed."}
{"text":"Reviews of Patisserie Harmonie and Bao Bao Dim Sum seem to be mixed together. I'm not sure if it's the same owner, but the places are side by side (Harmonie being at 85 de la Gauchetiere and Bao Bao being at 83 de la Gauchetiere). Harmonie has the brioche-like buns, croissants, tarts, etc., while Bao Bao has the cartoon steamed buns, bubble tea, and dim sum. This review is for Harmonie. I've reviewed Bao Bao under its own listing.

Hailing from Toronto, where in Chinatown there are tons of Chinese bakeries, I feel that Harmonie is just average. Prices are higher than in Toronto and the taste is not as good, in my opinion. 

The mochi balls here are $1.50, the same in Toronto are $1 and some of the ones in Toronto are even filled with real fruit, not just peanuts and coconut. 

They sell tarts that they call \"Portuguese egg tarts\" but the crust is all wrong. The crust is more like a pie crust instead of the flaky phyllo-like crust typical of pasteis de nata. Even T&T Supermarket has better Portuguese custard tarts.

It's usually really busy and crowded in there, because even though the prices are higher than I'm used to in Toronto, they are still cheap eats. Prices are comparable to those in Ottawa (where I live now), where it's even slimmer pickings for Chinese Bakeries :("}
{"text":"Montreal's Chinatown is not big compared to other cities, but this bakery easily rivals if not wins many others in bigger Chinatowns.  

I admit when I saw pictures of those insanely cute buns in the shape of Hello Kitty, Keroppi and more (a mystery why they haven't received any letter from lawyers yet), I made it a point to stop by on my trip.  I was blown away that besides these buns they have a lot more to offer.  So many varieties, so many interesting flavors, everything tempts me.  They also have many pastries in bags to go, so definitely take some on the road."}
{"text":"Love all the steam buns at this place. They have great animals design. The drinks is not great though ."}
{"text":"Fantastic place filled with sweet and/or salty buns.

My only concern is the absence of table. There is some chairless tables to put some dressing on your buns before you go. But, nowhere can you sit. But to me it's (almost) a plus.

Buy a bun, do a walk around the block or go sit outside. When Mother Nature cooperate that is!"}
{"text":"Awesome place 
It's a serve yourself place which is great you just take a tray go around and pick what you want from plastic container. 

Desserts, lunch, bubble tea and plenty of buns! I tried two different kinds one had bbq and one was curry. Never had them before but it had me come back for a second time with another friend."}
{"text":"Nice bakery and coffee place. The price is also reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just love your dessert I wish you don't change anything your staff is very friendly also well kept and clean love your staff and also love to see your bakery in little Italy"}
{"text":"Very inexpensive. Stop by here if you want a quick meal on the go  like a pork bun or something. This bakery was I believe the first one to open in Chinatown on that particular street. Now there's bakeries left and right opened. Anyway I like their Hong Kong milk tea, always order that or the egg tarts! The egg tarts are cheaper in Chinatown than they are in the Guy one actually for some reason, well last time I checked. I haven't tried their cakes, but their pastries are ok. Some are too sweet I find. I'm not that into Asian pastries unless it's green tea/durian...so i'm a bit biased. But worth checking out for cheap snacks/cakes."}
{"text":"The pastries are so good and so cheap. It's impossible to dislike. I spend most of my time downtown so I go to Coco bun which is the same chain. 

My favourites are the relish and hotdog buns, meat patties, spinach pastries,  and cheese buns. 

The staff is always so lovely. The place is always packed and they get everything done pretty fast."}
{"text":"I was excited to pick up some Chinese pastries after craving them all these months. I read the reviews, and decided to drag my friends to Montreal's teeny Chinatown to let them try the beautiful buns themselves. 

What a drag! I could've gone to the cocobun in guy concordia, because they carry the exact same products. I went to Harmonie on a sunday evening, when the bakery was sparse with leftover pastries. I decided to try something new. I bought a small preserved egg-filled pastry for $1.50. Call me a cheap for saying this, but for 1.50 it was totally not worth it. Overpriced for that little ball of average. 

Where should I be getting a fresh, fluffy coconut bun not produced by some lousy pastry chain??"}
{"text":"On our last day in Montreal, we went to Chinatown.  Even though I've been to Montreal numerous times, I rarely visit the stores in Chinatown.  We bought a green tea sponge cake, BBQ pork bun, custard bun and something else that I can't remember (it was my non-vegan weekend, man, did I ever miss healthy food, but I digress).  

While the prices were slightly more expensive than Chinese baked goods in Toronto, the flavouring was great and they didn't cheap out on ingredients as everything tasted like it said (i.e. BBQ pork had pork flavour, green tea sponge cake had green tea flavour, etc.).

If you are in Chinatown, then this is a great place to take Asians who want authentic Chinese baked goods."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese bakeries I've ever been in - everything is delicious and inexpensive. We went three days in a row while visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"First things, first...get a tray and a pair of tongs then peruse the shelves for what bread or pastry jumps out to you. Stack 'em as high as your tray can handle and head over to the counter so they can box it up for you nice and good. Make sure you have cash...it's cash only!

What did I get? Well, for starters, I went with their PORK FLOSS, then I saw they had a SPICY ONE so I also got that, next was their HOTDOG BREAD, and I thought I already had too much but we saw the EGG TARTS, and finally on our way to the register we came across the CUSTARD FILLED-BREAD. Bottom line, if you love fresh baked buttery pastries, walking in here is like going inside a candy store. Most of the items cost about $1-$2 so don't get carried away. Remember, \"a moment on your lips, a lifetime on your hips\"! 

My favorites? Honestly, it's the SPICY PORK FLOSS that really left a mark on my palate. It's shredded dried pork drizzled on a buttery bun. No filling but the topping is more than enough to make this pastry burst with savory flavors. Not to mention, it's pretty filling! The spicy level wasn't as high as I hoped it would be but then again, I like spicy food. For me it's mild so maybe for others it's spicy enough. The PORK FLOSS that's shaped almost like a square is another fave. Not spicy but the pork is drizzled on some mayo on top of the bread. That added fat just sealed the deal for me. 

I didn't get to try the egg tarts and custard bread since my friend ate them all. I hear they were good! The hotdog bread on the other hand was nothing to write home about.

Make sure to come in the morning to get the \"freshest\" pastries and bread. They also have quite a selection of bubble milk teas that looked really good. Now, I regret not trying any."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when we were walking through Chinatown. We weren't particularly hungry, but saw the cutest buns on display and decided to check out the place.  First of all, this place deserves three stars purely on the freaking adorable ways they make the different buns. They had various shapes, including rabbits, bears, chicks, Hello Kitty and even porcupines. I loved the different colors and shapes, so unique!! They also had a display of a giant peach split open with little peaches inside. 

Unfortunately all of the cute buns had sweet fillings and I was in the mood for something savory. I settled on the pork and pickled vegetable bao, as well as the BBQ pork bao. Both were plain looking, just like a regular bao. I liked the fluffy and light skin of the buns, but the filing was too little and tasted average. I wonder if sweet/cute buns were better. I still ended up giving the place four stars because the originality of its creations and the great tasting skins of the baos. Wish there was a place like this in NY, the cute baos would make a great hostess gift or gift for children."}
{"text":"Perfectly average Chinese buns, pastries, and baked goods, although served in a nicer, cleaner looking shop than most of its Chinatown neighbors. The egg tarts (dan tat) are decent and authentic. 

Not necessarily the best Chinese baked goods I've ever had, but I suspect the overall quality of Chinese food to be had here in Montréal pales in comparison to areas with larger, more competitive Chinese markets like Toronto (Markham), Vancouver (Richmond), NYC (Queens), and LA (San Gabriel Valley)."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious and cheap. I had: 

Egg Tart (danta)
The danta here are big and good! The egg was perfect and not overly sweet. I packed it with me on my flight to Toronto and it kept well the next day! Plus I'm sure everyone was envious as I devoured my danta on the plane. 

Portugese Egg Tart
Also very good! These are a bit flakier, with a sweeter egg center. They're oh so good. 

Mochi (coconut sesame and honeydew)
These were really good! I've never had mochi in coconut or honeydew flavors and these did not disappoint. 

Boba milk tea
Standard boba milk tea - boba was chewy and soft, milk tea was good but I wish it had a bit more of a tea flavor. 

Overall I highly recommend Partisserie Harmonie. It's such an on-point Chinese bakery that I would say it could rival the bakeries in SF. it's that good!"}
{"text":"Such a nice, clean, and delicious little bakery in Montreal's Chinatown! It was crowded even on a Thursday afternoon! The Hong Kong style milk tea (got it without sugar) is absolutely amazing!! Grabbed a bunch of bakery items that looked appealing. Just to name some - the green tea cake with red bean paste inside, Japanese steam cake, matcha cream cake, and almond cookies are so good!! Prices are reasonable for the quality and portions! Definitely recommend if you are looking for some light fluffy delicious snacks in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The cream coconut buns were amazing.  The baking was all very fresh and tasty. Just remember cash only."}
{"text":"Excellent egg tarts (both portugese and chinese style) and great milk tea (not too sweet). Roast pork bun was ok - better was the cream filled bun! Hubby and I came for a quick but delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"RUDE. When I was paying the Chinese lady was talking crap about us in Cantonese about how dumb Americans are because we didn't see the sign only debit cards. She felt like an idiot after my mom responded back to her in Cantonese."}
{"text":"Addicting! Once i buy some of these i think about buying more everyday for several weeeks! Theyre just too good!!"}
{"text":"My family and I wandered in looking for a light breakfast and the buns we got were all fresh and warm.  We also got the mochi patties filled with sesame paste and creamy custard.  They were both really good with the perfect amount of sweetness and not too sticky.  Their warm milk tea was good as well.  I wish we had come back here again before we left the city, but unfortunately we didn't have the time."}
{"text":"I'm going to be craving their honeydew bubble tea for years to come now. Very unfortunate, as I live 3 hours away. :("}
{"text":"Great: egg tart, iced hk milk tea, iced honey lemon tea"}
{"text":"Got the taro porcupine bun. It was super super cute!!!! The bun was pretty good, fluffy, with a sweet filling. I would like more fillings in my bun though please!!"}
{"text":"We liked the egg custard \"dan tart\" and the black sesame mochi. We didn't like have taro slushy with boba. Way too sweet. 

This is our 3rd day in montreal and we have frequented there 3rd times.  I guess their quality and price are in line."}
{"text":"Grande qualité de produit, produit frais et a coût très abordable.
Idéal pour un en cas mais même, vous pouvez trouver tout pour un bon petit repas sur le pouce.
Beaucoup de choix chaud comme les pains au boeuf et cari, porc bbq, saucisses, échalottes, très gras néanmoins et énormément de pain comparé a la quantité de garniture mais ça vaut la peine pour le prix.

Je recommende les Mochi, les pains au café avec leurs gout sucré-salé ainsi que les gâteaux au fromage!"}
{"text":"Omg. Cute!

I took a few steamed buns of different flavors to-go. I LOVE the texture of steamed buns. The first one I tried was the green tea frog shaped one. It was delicious.

I didn't try one of each but I think they were all really good. I'm sad that where I live we don't have a shop like this."}
{"text":"This might be the worst roast pork bun I've had in a while. There was a ton of starch used as filling and the occasional pork swimming in the midst was just a stringy hot mess. Avoid. 

Mochi with coconut milk and black sesame was a nice redeeming factor after the forementioned travesty of a pork bun. It's the only reason I bumped my 2 stars to 3. 

Another takeaway is that they don't accept international cards so bring cash if possible."}
{"text":"Basically our favorite breakfast pastry shop. The baked goods are sooooo delicious, you don't need to try any other shops down the street. Everything is fresh, and it's always packed (so you know it's great). I loved grabbing an iced Hong Kong style tea (in the cold? yeah I know) with some egg tarts and pineapple buns. There are also plenty of snacks to buy for the road (Pocky!). Other great selections we tried, was the shredded pork buns, custard buns, and swiss rolls.

Yum yum yum :)"}
{"text":"I can see this place as a get in and get out for a quick bite.  Sure there are the standard buns and sweet breads and the boba, but for us, we stumbled in there while on search to feed me, the birthday girl, some traditional Chinese breakfast grub yesterday morning.  

The service is crap.  One of the girls seemed pissed off and the other didn't quite understand what we wanted...but being Chinese and having grown up with less than stellar service, I'm cool with it.  Service just isn't high on the list when it comes to casual Chinese restaurants.  

Didn't matter.  They had a decent menu and a few porridge selections which I was more than happy to indulge in.  Western breakfast options available for the hubby which meant it was a safe bet where we can both have something to eat that matches our palate.  I ordered the pork and salted egg option with the Sao bing yiu tiao and he got the bacon eggs and toast.  I snuck away to the bakery side and picked out a cranberry muffin and what looked like three sugar sprinkled donuts on a stick.  Kind of like a donut kebab!  Brought it ack to the table, ordered a traditional boba tea for the hubby and indulged.  His meal was simple.  Egg whites, one piece of toast buttered up and bacon.  My choices were great.  He loves his boba and I love my chili oil with my breakfast.

Couldn't be any different, but both were happy as we watched the news on the tv up on the wall.  

I think this place is great to duck in from the cold, order up some traditional speedy Chinese fare, have a cup of tea, eat a pastry or two and head out on your way.  Nothing fancy, cheery interior, decent food...
Four stars."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for Hong Kong egg tarts (boyfriends favourite) and left with a lot more. The chicken coconut mango buns are so cute, shaped like little chickens!

This place was probably the highlight of our entire Montreal trip. After filling up on bubble tea, we had some delicious congee and preserved egg as it was a cold day. It's the perfect thing to warm you up.

We made a detour on our way out of Montreal just to come here one final time. Everything was absolutely delicious and quite reasonable in price. The shop is very clean and colourful, pleasant to be in and it is well staffed at all times (at least for the several varying times we were there).

At this point I think it's say no more, clearly I am a huge fan."}
{"text":"This Chinatown bakery is one of the cleanest and most organized ones I've been to. The large assortment of buns and cakes all looked really appetizing. We stopped in here twice, and both times it was pretty packed. We ended up trying a roasted pork bun and a sesame ball with red bean paste - they were both okay and not the best we've had, but the environment just in itself would make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Harmony my %^$!!!!!  Ok ok ok...this place definitely has some good quality egg tarts and other treats;  but the saleslady/owner is a jerk.  We came there when our dollar was only worth 98 cents canadian.  So we bought a few things to munch on, and it came out to $12 CANADIAN.  We, being stupid, arrogant American tourists, didn't have Canadians and decided to pay in US dollars.  As soon as the lady heard that, she told us because of the exchange rate, the price is $14 in US money.  Ok....I KNOW she knows how to calculate money, but I offered my help in math anyway.  \" it's actually only $12.24 in US money\" I said with a smile.  She countered with a smile also, but a bit more annoyed \"no it's $14 in US, if you don't want to pay in US money, maybe you should go to a bank and exchange and come back here with Canadian money.  I traveled to the US when our Canadian money was much lowered than your american money.  So now it's all good for us that you come here when our money is much better.  It's like SWEET revenge.\"  WHOA..... I didn't expect all that on a Sunday morning.  I realized my disadvantaged of being an American surrounded by Canadians, who just came out from churches and hungry (did I mention they have ridiculously beautiful churches?), so I just shut my mouth, paid $14 and got the hell out of there.  I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice...oh wait... there WAS that horrible Canadian riot when our Bruins came to Canada not so long ago....
     Damn Canadians!!!!  Wait until our currency picks up again...you'll see!!!"}
{"text":"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  A nice food stop to eat a quick snack of bao buns and pastries.

Let's be real - I stopped in to see the cute Hello Kitty buns.  

I ordered the \"Combo A\" which comes with a bun of your choice, 2 dim sum, spring roll and chow mein.

This is what I ate:
BBQ pork bun - bun was steamed perfectly and soft.  Good amount of pork filling and tasty.

Shrimp dumpling - wrapper was under cooked.  Shrimp filling ok.

Pork shumai - a bland tasting shumai - I added shiracha for flavor.

Chow mein noodles were tasty, yummy.

Spring roll - under fried."}
{"text":"Bakeries are still a relatively rare site in China. In modern China the populace has embraced bread, but on their terms.  

Patisserie Harmonie in the heart of Chinatown is evidence to that. The display cases along every wall are filled with assorted baked goods providing ample evidence that you are in a bakery. The fresh baked smell of bread wafting through the air is noticeably absent and a closer look at the items on display appear garners a bit of curiosity, a slight craving, and a bit of nausea.

A few gems can be found that are worth trying.  The egg tarts are a classic and if you can get them warm they are worth trying here.  There's a coconut custard filled bun that is also not bad, but it seems they may have discontinued it recently.  I'd steer clear of anything with meat floss or mayonnaise or excessive amounts of sugar cream, but that's just me.  The slightly warm buns filled with assorted meats including but not limited to curry pork and bbq pork are more stomach churning than mouth watering for me so I avoid them like the plague.

Aside from that the store is usually quite busy which means food is fresh and lines are long. It's not always the cleanest place, though for Chinatown it's about average. It's certainly a Chinese style bakery, but it's not a terribly great example.  There are a few more Chinese bakeries spread around the city (Guy-Concordia metro and Atwater metro) and I actually prefer them, but when in Chinatown this is the place to get your fix."}
{"text":"We were wondering about Chinatown when I had a craving for a cocktail bun. I saw the great reviews on yelp and made a B-line for this place. The place is PACKED and rightly so. You get to pick a tray and put all the tasty treats you'd like on it and they pack it up and send you on your way for a pretty reasonable price (~$1.00 a bun). They are also busily stocking the shelves as you shop ensuring a great selection and super fresh product. I grabbed a cocktail bun and a hot dog bun as I was in a bit of rush. The cocktail bun was still warm and filled with lots of coconutty goodness. THe Hot dog bun was also warm and satisfying. Can't wait to go back and try a wider selection."}
{"text":"A lot of people very much enjoy this place, that's evident by the crowds and high ratings.  I am not one of those people.  I might just be a bit too spoiled by the fact I live near the largest Chinatown in the world, outside of China itself.  

I am sure their bubble teas are delish but that's not all that difficult to accomplish.  

The pastry I purchased was stale and without much custard filling.  Definitely not the best and surprisingly so.  I wouldn't try it again.  Given there aren't that many Asian bakery choices in Montreal, it makes a little sense that this establishment does well. 

The upside?  It's cheap!"}
{"text":"Delicious! As authentic as you can get to a HK pastry place away from HK. Found this place randomly on yelp during my trip with my bf to Montreal. The prices were reasonable and fresh. Their eggtarts were freshly made and I enjoyed their not-so-sugary HK milktea with boba. I bought probably 5-10 different types of pastry, ranging from my favorite hot dog bun to \"but jah go - jelly in a cup\" to green tea cookies for souvenirs to curry beef buns, all were outstanding. If you wait till 1130, the next door HK cafe is open too and you can grab some real food there. Overall, we were in Montreal for three days and we tried to come back every day! We even snuck a box of eggtarts back to DC to eat and it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to spell it, just say it\" Guy May Bow\" - best pastry I have ever had. Coconut, sugar, butter - all wrapped in a soft warm baked shell."}
{"text":"This place makes some awesome asian pastries and excellent Hong Kong style milk tea!! 

They offer all the usual asian bakery suspects, such as beef curry tart, pork buns, taro stuffed sweet bun and dried pork buns as well.

Their tea is awesome. The Hong Kong Milk tea is the best that I have ever tasted. 

Lastly make sure to have the egg tart. I live in NYC and I have never tasted a better egg tart. It is sooooo buttery and good!!! 

They take both US and Canadian Dollars."}
{"text":"This is a nice and clean bakery in China Town, I went there to try new flavours and fell in love with matcha and red beans! 
I live in Montreal and have been back quite a few times. The most popular items are the egg tarts (both Portuguese and Chinese are good and kept warm), the Chinese donuts (my favourites), red bean fried balls (very good as well) and the BBQ Pork bun (I'm not personally a fan of sweet bread and sweet meat). The breads are light and fluffy but most of the pastries are on the sweet side and the creamy ones are often quite heavy. 
They bake throughout the day until lunch, go early for fried foods as they tend to get a bit oily and more choice on the savoury buns, I would say 12pm is the best for quality and quantity. 
They also have some buns leftover from the day before that they sell at discounted price at opening and they sell bubble tea and birthday cakes."}
{"text":"This review is for their egg tarts only. 

They were GREAT! 

It was super difficult to find a decent place in Chinatown to eat! We finally settled for Patisserie La Legende across the street and then came over here to get some egg tarts to go. They were the right choice."}
{"text":"The baked goods here are so delicious. We opted for the sponge cake, brioche buns and the steamed buns with meat filling. Don't come here
On an empty stomach or else you will find yourself buying everything from the store! 

They also have bubble tea but i was too full to have some. 

They sell a pastry that looks like macarons (comes in a 3 pack)-- they aren't macarons though. They have the texture of a ladyfinger but other than that, there was no taste to it. This was the only thing we bought that we didn't like."}
{"text":"I have been to Patisserie Harmonie several times and it is a great place to pick up some dan tat (Chinese egg tarts), buns, or whatever else you may be craving.

We went here after lunch to have a bubble tea, which is a first for me here. Don't know why but I've never tried their BBT until now.  I had a plain mango BBT ($4) and my friend had black tea or something along those lines. Anyways, both were good - refreshing, not too sweet and perfect for our post-Kazu walk.

They have great pastries so make sure you grab a few for home if your already there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for all your asian bakery needs.  My faves are Char Siu Bau (BBQ Pork) and Coconut buns!  Lineups can be long and people are buzzing like bees in here so be patient!  at around $1 a bun it's great value!!!"}
{"text":"Pork BBQ bun was fantastic! Better than the ones at Pattiserie Callia (Callia's buns were a bit too sweet and lacking in meat a bit). Plain scallion buns were very good as well. Bacon and scallion bun was interesting and pretty good but had a bit too much bacon for my taste. My sister had the coconut cream bun, and she thought it was good but nothing special (she said she'd give it 3 stars). All breads here are always warm, doughy-soft, fresh, and tasty. Huge portions at cheap prices. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Chinatown is this place, which focuses on taking the Chinese bakery to the next level.  What drew us to this place was their playful take on the bao, which made the kids go nuts.  

The bakers here shape their steamed baos into cute animal shapes and have more modern takes like green tea and red bean shaped like a little frog face.  There is substance behind the style however as the buns looked as good as they tasted.  The green tea dough was infused with just the right amount of powder which made it fragrant and not overpowering.  The red bean filling was excellent and the baos were steamed to perfection.  Portions are large so don't get greedy.  A must if you're in the area and you love baos."}
{"text":"Saw a few reviews on yelp about this Asian bakery and had to drop. Out of all of the Asian bakeries that we saw in chinatown, this one had the most variety.

Taro bun - the taro was abundant and the sweet flavor was great, but outside texture of the bun is a little bit more firm than what I'm used to.

Red bean sesame bun - the red bean had the perfect texture and the sweetness was just right. The sesame seeds on the outside gave this bun a lovely nutty taste.

BBQ pork bun - the pork meat was shredded and the sauce was a little bit too sweet for my taste.

Red bean mochi - the mochi was soft, but the dough itself was a little flavorless. 

Scallion bun - the texture was soft and the green onions and hint of salt on top made the perfect combo.

Scallion and pork floss roll - I didn't taste this bun, hubby picked this one, but didn't eat it until a few days later so the taste wasn't the same if it were fresh

Pork and onion puff - another item that the hubby picked out. I didn't get to taste it, but the aromas were tantalizing. 

Overall, since chinatown is so small and doesn't have that many bakeries, I would drop by again to grab a few pastries if I had a craving.  Richmond, BC definitely beats Montreal in the Asian pastries department.  I would recommend the taro bun, red bean sesame bun, & the scallion bun."}
{"text":"really good asian bakery. they have everything they would normally have in an asian bakery. they also have these cute meat and sweet buns next door thats character designed!"}
{"text":"Convenient location. Grabbed breakfast for the next day twice while staying in Old Montreal on vacation. Sponge cake is so good. Also tried the strawberry and mango mousse and cake cups inside the display case at cashier. Cash only but not if above $5."}
{"text":"Okay. Preface: I love egg tarts. I also love little Asian bakeries because it reminds me of home (LA). So low and behold, I find myself traveling through Montreal, stumbling on this particular Asian bakery and delighting myself to TWO egg tarts before dinner. When you travel by yourself you get to make these kind of wild decisions.

Anywho - they were delicious and just the right price. In addition, the ladies who worked there had great light hearted humor. I said I wanted two egg tarts - to which jokingly they replied, \"TWO BOXES of egg tarts?\" (This is funny, trust me.) 

Me: Can I just get two egg tarts?

Cashier: No.

(Group laughter follows and I get my two egg tarts and with that I am on my way)."}
{"text":"\"It's what the inside that counts\"

Inside, outside, these are the real buns. They're not your typical beauties that can't speak for themselves. The filling to bun ratio is pretty good.

I bought a chicken teriyaki bun, pork bun, green tea red bean Keroppi bun, a mango chick bun, two wife pastries, and a chinese donut. The chicken teriyaki wasn't that great because it was very sweet but everything else was done very well. Order everything if you can! They might sell out, but there's something new out every hour.

On the other side of the bakery they also had baked goods instead of the steamed buns and you could go around picking what you want. They also had Doraemon shaped cakes!

Cash or debit only.

I wish Boston had a bakery like this, but bakeries in Boston's Chinatown are all traditionalists."}
{"text":"Montreal has the best egg tarts! flaky crust, perfectly baked egg custard, not too sweet.  This comment is coming from a person that is from Vancouver, British Columbia,  a city not too far from Richmond where they are known to have the best Chinese food in BC outside of China."}
{"text":"I love this place! seriously!! The bread desserts are a great treat if you don't want anything too sweet; the hot-dog \"pastry\" is super tasty believe it or not and their \"slushes\" are fantastic (and made with real fruit!!).
Prices are super worth it ($1 or so per small pastry).. $3 or so for a big slush... I love going to this place!!! 
if you're in the area, you should definitely go in!"}
{"text":"Tartelette aux ufs style Hong Kong, crêpe au gâteaux, fourrée de pâte fèves rouges, brioche ´momo' fourrée de purée de noix de coco, et plus!! Tellement incroyable!!"}
{"text":"A variety of asian baked pastries and bubble mik teas.
-Sweetheart Cake- a different take on winter melon inside. Actually had some small solid crunchy pieces, not as sweet as others
-Portugese egg tart- warm, flaky crust, soft egg custard w a light carmelized layer on top. To me this is very similar to their Hong Kong egg tart though slighty smaller. 
-Hong Kong egg tart-soft buttery crust, soft egg custard."}
{"text":"Impeccablement tenue, cette petite pâtisserie asiatique surprend par la qualité de ses produits autant que par ses bas prix.  La grande majorité des produit est faite à base de pain brioché, ce qui est assez curieux, surtout quand on choisit du salé, mais pas désagréable...  Un choix intéressant de brioches salées, conservées au chaud, font de cet endroit un arrêt idéal pour boucher un coin sans se ruiner (1,50$ pièce, et elles ne sont pas petites) pendant une balade dans le quartier."}
{"text":"Cake on the brain cake on the brain! Sometimes it happens that I just want cake and Montreal is a city where I feel there are limited choices...unless you want to pay $7-10 for a fancy slice somewhere...fancy. Even then...where to go for a really good slice of fresh home made chocolate or white cake with buttercream icing? A few moons ago I ended up in \"Chinatown\" with a friend and after dinner were looking for a sweet shop. She mentioned Harmony so we walked in and I was taken aback...what were all of these perfectly formed, sweetly packaged cakes?! Sponge cakes of all kinds...lighter than air - green tea cake, red bean (sounds odd but is actually quite lovely!)...most with a nice white cream filling. I sampled quite a few and they were all divine and truly inexpensive. You could take 2-3 to go and have a tea party chez vous for under $6. 

HIGHLY recommend their green tea roll w. little flecks of red bean as well as the classic white sponge triangles. PERFECTION!"}
{"text":"Patisserie Harmoine is located in Chinatown and they probably have the best bread buns I've ever had! I also got egg tarts which were 6 for $5 (very yummy). The only regret I have is not getting more buns while I was there!"}
{"text":"Yup saw the cute animal buns on display. Didn't get it cuz it was filled with red bean and other sweet fillings. That's something I don't like. The hello kitty bun was misshaped during this visit. 

I got a chocolate eclair, a chocolate filled bun, corn bun and a flakey pastry. Corn bun was dried out so it may have sat in the heater too long. The kids liked the chocolate desserts. 

Service was fast."}
{"text":"Came across this place while exploring Chinatown. It was a busy and apparently very popular bakery for the local. Not only it cater the certain clientele in the chinatown area, there were a lot of non-asian clientele that frequent the bakery.

It's affordable and from what it seems like a pretty decent quality. Baked goods tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"I really like the green tea mochi!  So delicate and fresh!! sweet buns were soft and delicious too!  Plus s'il vous plaît ?"}
{"text":"Cette petite pâtisserie dans le Chinatown je l'ai vu ouvrir, puis s'agrandir légèrement et évoluer au fil des années. Les produits sont frais, ils changent souvent les types de beignes afin de garder notre intérêt et curiosité. Ils proposent même des croissants et chaussons aux pommes qui ont un meilleur goût que certaines pâtisseries françaises!!!  Les prix sont tellement abordables entre 1$ et 3$ et on peut même se procurer des bubble tea à différentes saveurs ils en ont au moins une trentaine à bons prix. En été c'est parfait! Service rapide pas le temps de trop sourire mais on ne s'attend pas à autre chose du quartier et avec ce qu'ils nous offrent on ne leur en tient pas rigueur. À consommer sans modération et à partager surtout avec ses amis et collègues vous ferez plein d'heureux :D"}
{"text":"I hate to do this and give it a bad rating, cause the place isn't bad, it just isn't for me.

Like most chinese bakeries the food isn't sugary, which is sad...cause I like my sugar and butter...

If you like your stuff more bread\"y\" than sweet, then you'll love it here. The place is good, if this is your kinda thing...just isn't mine it seems."}
{"text":"The pork buns and egg tarts were so good! I brought a box home to RI and my family loved them. So they were still good 6 hours later."}
{"text":"The place itself is separated into two sides, which was a bit confusing upon entering. There's a great variety of pastries and the ones I tried were delicious. Their pineapple buns are also gigantic."}
{"text":"Buns, Buns, Buns! Bakery got buns!! what more can you ask for?! They have a bun inception aka the cha siew bow inside a pineapple bun. The don tots are good, really good. Price are decent and the dough they use are fluffier than the ones I get in NYC. I even brought a box of buns on the airplane so I can enjoy them at home. Would like to return if in the Montreal area again."}
{"text":"I've going there for a few years now, 3-4 times a year. I love the pastries in there. I always buy a lot of them, put some in the freezer for my mom in Sherbrooke who loves them. I tried hot stuffed buns one time, as well as the red bean stuffed thing, and it's not for me. As for the sweet pastries: love them!! I especially love the steam cake (is it how you call it?) I could eat that all that! Definitely a place I'll go back to for the years to come."}
{"text":"Good cheap place to grab a bubble tea and decent chinese baked goods. Clean place and good service. Theres a good variety of drinks and they are very good and not too expensive. The pastries are a hit-or-miss but nothing is really bad. I mean, where can you grab filling food for this cheap ? One thing I don't like about some buns is that there isn't enough filling."}
{"text":"There was a time I came here every a few days for a bread, pork floss spring onion rolls, most of the time, and then it made me feel good all day long. Most of the bread here are not as attractive as that in China from the appearance, but the flavor is the same good, oh, steamed buns are all so cute, that's an exception. Egg tarts is great, the crust is light and flaky, the filling is tender and tasting! Pork floss bun is my favorite as it's special, nothing else could replace it. It's savory flavors topping with shredded dried pork. I like the pineapple also, it's simple, soft and have a crust to make it richer in flavor. Except that, they also have green tea cakes, chocolate éclairs, cream cakes...Actually, if you can't decide which to buy, I think everything here worth a try!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  Very impressed. Mostly impressed with the Chinese buns the most. They are gigantic and delicious. The matcha cake near the front wasn't nearly as delicious as I had hoped; it barely had any matcha flavor, just tasted with cake.  The best bun is the coffee bun. There is some butter magic in there. And that crust that oozes out from the sides?  Pure heaven."}
{"text":"Love this place!
Located in chinatown, it's cute, affordable, clean and DELICIOUS! I've tried their matcha roll cakes, cream cakes, chocolate eclairs and egg tarts and seriously, they are sooo good! The one thing I love about asian baked goods is that it's just the perfect amount of sweetness and it's never overly sweet which can get sickening. I've noticed that their cream is super smooth and perfectly sweet and their egg tarts are seriously 10/10. 

Will definitely come here again and get some other baked goods! Yumm"}
{"text":"This place is always buzzing with customers. Great place for asian pastries. They have a huge variety despite the size of the shop. They even have a taro puff pastry that I cant find in Los angeles. Only complaint, a little on the expensive side. But there is no other store that can compare."}
{"text":"Please note: this is NOT a french patisserie. It is in Chinatown and features asian-style baked pastries with various fillings. Not sure if any butter is used and while some may think that is a good thing, it won't do if you are expecting something \"French\".

That having been said, if you are looking for  baked (as opposed to steamed) dim sum, this might be your place."}
{"text":"Holy Buns! I came here twice in my short weekend trip to Montreal. This place has the deliciousness of a hole in the wall asian bakery but delivered with organization and style! They had every kind of baked good/dessert you could imagine and had everything clearly labeled. The price point is a little more than you'd expect from an asian bakery but everything is fresh, fully stocked and clean. I chose a coconut bun, red bean flaky bun, and 2 red bean sesame balls. My total was under $6 so I was very pleased with my selection. They also offer hot buns and snacks and I saw that they serve Boba Teas as well. On my next trip I'll have to experience both of those! I wish there was one of these in Portland, but alas, I'll have to make the trip back up to Monteal to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Patisserie Harmonie was a lifesaver for us during our stay in Montreal.  This Asian bakery is located in Montreal's tiny Chinatown, and it was very close to our hotel.  Made it very convenient to visit here just about anytime we wanted to.  Here is a rundown on what we tried here.

Hong Kong Egg Tarts are yummy!  Crust is light and flaky.  Definitely, some of the best egg tarts that I have ever eaten!  (5 stars)

Portuguese Egg Tarts were good.  Crust was a bit too burnt for my liking.  (3.75 stars)

Fried Chinese Beignet donut.  Yummy goodness!  (4 stars)

Shredded Pork Bun.  My wife liked this goodie a lot!  (4 stars)

Banana Rice cake (mochi).  Not bad at all.  (3.5 stars)

Sweet Crusted Brioche had No Filling!  Still delicious, though.  (4 stars)

Mango and Peanut Mochi is really good.  The texture goes crazy in your mouth.  The filling is generous.  Cannot taste the mango mochi though.  It is overpowered by the peanut and coconut filling.  (4.25 stars)

Bbq Pork bun is hot and good tasting.  (4 stars)

These were not all the food that we ate here during our 5 night stay.  Just some tidbits of information.  There was more that we wanted to try, but our metabolisms would not allow.

Depending on what time of the day you go, this bakery can get very busy and crowded.  The crew does a good job of keeping the line moving.  They also do a fine job of keeping the shop clean and organized.

I wish that Patisserie Harmonie was in my hometown. Oh well... Chances of returning here our 100% during our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Loved the pastry goodness...we had the hotdog and he curry beef. The pastries were all warm and very fresh. We are them right out the bag. Don't forget the egg custard one too!  The lines are long, however, they go fast:)"}
