{"text":"They were running low on wine...ok...and messed up our drink order (please write it down if you're not going to remember), and the food wasn't much to make up for all of that. Two stars for the nice view & staff that were mostly friendly."}
{"text":"Good beer, good times, Great band: DA THROWBACK BAND lots of girls and dancing."}
{"text":"First time today for lunch. It was what I had expected. It's bar food but better than midtown. I live across the street and plan to be back. I am looking forward to trying the raw bar items and their all you can eat night. This is a lake crowd type of bar. Bigger than rusty rudder but pretty much the same atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food. Fun place to relax with family & friends. Outdoor seating and sand volleyball. Lots of boat slips. Food and drinks are a little pricey but they are consistently good."}
{"text":"If I did not know this was not Midtown, I would have thought it was Midtown - the food here was average - the fish sandwich was ok - they ran out of french fries and had to get the chips - how do you run out of french fries?   The beer was not that cold and the glasses were warm and that made the beer warm quicker too.   It was $2.50 draft night but I had to wait about 10 minutes in between beers to get a refill.   I don't care about going back unless someone drags me here kicking and screaming..."}
{"text":"So they got the location right.  This place is right on the water of Lake Norman, beautiful view!  The meal was pretty good, I feel like it was something you can get so many other places and the dinner entrees seemed to be a little pricey to me for what you got.  So I opted for the mojo pork sandwich, it was good but I felt they should have used a harder crusty bread instead of the sub roll I got, because the pork made the roll a little too soggy for my liking.  I got the sweet potato fries with my dinner and those were soooo good! they had a nice brown sugar crust to them yummy!  My husband raved about his dinner, he LOVED their sashimi wrap.  He use to work in catering and he said, and I quote \"If I was still working in catering I would have called up my chef after this meal and told him to create a wrap like this for one of our events\".  So I believe that means, if you like ahi tuna, you should definitely get the sashimi wrap."}
{"text":"Arrived here last night after being running away from VInnie's due to one really messed up kitchen and an overwhelmed staff and manager.  We wanted a place on the lake and a couple in our group had a decent meal at lunch.  Frankly, I was expecting a 1 - 2 Star experience based on other things I've heard and read but, was pleasantly surprised to land on a 3 when it was all said and done.  It's hard to comprehend this joint ever exceeding that rating but I have to say it's a good deal better than the Midtown Sundries it replaced.    We started with some crab dip for the table and a variety of sandwiches following that up.  Crab Cake, Sashimi Wrap, Pub Fish Sandwich were all on our list and everyone said there's was pretty good.  Mine was the Fish Sandwich and, while nicely fried, not greasy and pretty tasty, the fish itself was half the size of the fresh bun it was on.  I tore away a lot of the bun and went at it though and it was decent.  Our server was on top of things, knew the beer list and the differences in the beers and, most importantly, kept them coming.  All in all an OK, if somewhat unexpected experience."}
