{"text":"Booked on line and response was quick.  Had to change date and there were accommodating.  Very nice atmosphere, service was great.  (slow, but that is what you expect with a nice dinner)  Made for a wonderful evening.  Food was delicious, although maybe a little salty.  We were a party of four and we all had something different and it was all great.  Glass of wine was pricey.   (I was scared, because someone I know didn't like this restaurant at all, gave it a very bad review)  I had a coupon for it, which made me try it, and it turned out to be a Lovely Yummy evening."}
{"text":"Went to Tappo for dinner last night with friends. We were looking for a seat on the patio and happily waited in the lounge area while others finished up. 

...45 minutes later, after seeing someone else arrive and get seated, I inquired with the hostess about the status of our table. She said they forgot about us and that there'd be another 25 minute wait for a table. 

So we left, hungry and unamused."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this Resturant. Very disappointed with the food. I'm glad I didn't pay the full price for it. The Resturant itself is a great venue but that's about it."}
{"text":"I used a groupon here which gave me 70$ worth of food for 30$. Cupon was easy to use and wait staff was excellent. It was difficult to get them to confirm reservation on a friday or sat ( i tried several times), then my cupon was about to expire and i made reservation request on a tuesday night which was no problem. Restaurant has a great atmosphere
We ordered: one glass of wine ($10), tortellini soup($10), salad($10), sausage and rapini risotto($25) and shared a brownie ($10)for dessert and water ($5). Everything was absolutely delicious, and would recommend it... that being said i feel its a bit overpriced... which is why i didn't give it 4 stars, instead of 5 stars. Keep in mind my date for the evening had the soup as her main, which was classified as an appetizer, be prepared to pay 25-45$ for a main here."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  

We were immediately suspicious of the quality of the food so we only ordered appetizers.  We ordered frutti de mare and the rice balls.  They came out in literally two minutes.  The food was cold.  The squid was rubbery.  I'm not convinced anything was freshly cooked.   The bread was clearly not fresh.  

The ambience is Jersey Shore meets strip club.  I can't articulate it better than that.  Not only did the quality of clientele look suspicious, but every server looked strung out on drugs. In fact our server even commented that he needed more booze or drugs to make it through his shift (I presume he was joking but it just underscored that, despite the nice building Tappos occupies, Tappos is really classless). 

If you are a tourist and El Catrin is busy, ok, fair enough, have a drink here. If you are from Toronto, you should know better.   Stick to Buca or Terroni if Buca is full.  Or anywhere else in The Distillery.  

Our server, while nice, swore constantly, almost dropped our frutti de mare but saved it by putting his hands over it and still served it to us and put his hands all over the rims of our prosecco glasses. 

Bottom line: do not eat here."}
{"text":"Great decor and a wonderful menu. If you like Lamb you will not be disappointed. Really cosy atmosphere with good music playing, attentive servers and wide variety of customers.  I have gone  numerous times and have always had a good experience. You might even bump into one of the owners too and if you are a hockey fan you will recognize him as Shane Corson."}
{"text":"This place has the veneer of a high end restaurant, but you can do better. 

The ambiance in the dining room is great, the presentation of the food is quite nice, and the bill matches that...

However, the food quality itself is only meh, wine list by the glass lists only the varietal, so I assume they're just giving you a house wine, and service isn't all that attentive (we had to grab our own jackets behind the service desk at the end of the night). 

Finally, in a restaurant with an upscale price point and ambiance, they have a dive-bar-esque vending machine and advertising box in the washroom. Hilarious, but come on!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I read mixed reviews, but took my chance with a Groupon.

I called to make reservations for the same day, a Wednesday night.  The guy who picked up was pretty rude which was a big turn off for me.  Made the rezo for 8:30pm since that's all they had.

I get there at 8:25pm and I'm told they're running 15 min behind.  I asked to be seated outside and was seating immediately since it was a cool night and outside was empty.  Waiter was really slow (likely cuz it was busy), but he compensated by being SUPER nice.  He didn't bring our water until about 9pm, that's how slow/busy he was.  

I wanted the rice balls but they ran out apparently so I got the bison ribs to start.  They fell off the bone and was pretty good.  Second dish was a clam pasta, but I swear I didn't taste any clams at all, BUT it was still a very good pasta dish.

For entrees we got the steak and veal medallions.  The steak was probably the size of your face, but the veal were these 2 tiny pieces the size of a butter pack (refer to my uploaded pics) and the dish itself was pretty skimpy.  For a dish that was like $36 it was a rip off.  We complained and they very nicely brought out 2 more medallions.  The waiter commented on the steak we got normally isn't that large.

With the combination of experiences, I give this place two stars.  Decent food depending on what you order, but a little over rated.  With a place like this I expect better overall service from beginning to end."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Tappo we were impressed - food was good, service was attentive and all around great experience.

Second time, not so much. In fact, it was awful. We had to wait forever for our food and when it arrived, we were served food that was not what was described in the menu. We waited for about an hour between appetizers and the main and every time we asked where the food was we were told \"it's coming\" ... if not for the live band we would've walked. 

In terms of service, if our server was trying to give us space, he succeeded by rarely visiting and failing to fill our water glasses, EVEN when we asked him multiple times. He kept on forgetting and was absent for most of the night except when we purposefully flagged him down to ask where our food was and to remind him YET AGAIN for water. 

When the food finally came, we received dishes that weren't exactly what was on the menu. I ordered lamb chops but received what looked like lamb loin piece (?) and I believe they sauced it like the beef dish that my husband ordered, which was WEIRD because that was not what was described on the menu.

At this point though, all I wanted to do was eat and get out of there as it was pretty late. So I ate for hunger as opposed to enjoyment, we paid the bill and left.

Best part of the evening was the music. The band that they hire on Thursdays is AMAZING! :)"}
{"text":"Never has a mushroom tasted so good. As a (pecto) veggie, I have had my fair share of portobello mushrooms. I have never been to a restaurant that treated a mushroom like a steak, ensuring it was cooked to absolute perfection. The softest, most delicate goat's cheese, perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes, a bed of arugula, and a perfectly reduced (very expensive) balsamic dressing. I savoured every bite.

However, the second course blew my mind. A new fish eater, I'm fairly difficult to please. Comparing all fish with the mahi mahi in hawaii or the tuna in new york, I'm not exactly forgiving when it comes to my seafood. I very literally, sipped every drop of the BROTH from my seafood dish. The seafood was incredible. I took a chance ordering a dish including muscles (who wants to eat a chewy piece of gum called a MUSCLE for chrissakes anyway), and i ATE. IT. UP. Soooo good.

I spent a fortune at this restaurant in honour of my boyfriend's 27th birthday, with absolutely NO regrets. Can't wait to spend a fortune there again. The staff is unparallelled (our waiter brought me all of the desserts, as I couldn't decide which one I wanted, and Dominic remembered my name).

FULLY recommended as an intimate event or a romantic meal. Part of an incredible evening to convince my boyfriend that birthdays are important. Thanks Tappo! As always, unmatched meal and service.

Conclusion? Expensive, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Food Ok but mediocre for the price (entrees in the ~$35 range), and service was horrible. The waiter tried to compensate by being nice, which he was, and he was well trained, but they clearly understaffed the place. It took us 17 minutes (literally) to be served water, another 15 for the wine and bread to arrive, and that was only after we lost patience and called our waiter. It got slightly better towards 11pm, when the volume of work receded, but quite frankly for a $$$ restaurant that kind of service with mediocre food is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over a year. The service is amazing, the food is to die for, and you always feel important here! Beat location with parking! Highly recommend. The owners are very personable to the clients which is huge!"}
{"text":"To begin with, the reservation system at the place is terrible. I made various effort to get a hold on anyone in the resto, always went to voicemail. They called back on the day of my requested time and told me it was fully booked. That already threw me off quite a bit. Bottom line is, it is difficult to make a reservation with an answering machine, and they don't call you back on time. 

Menu doesn't have too many choices for entrees, and the dishes can be quite pricey. It starts with appertizers, second dish pasta, then entrees. We ordered the grilled calamari, Gnocchi and Cornish Hen; must admit the lamb was really good and the portion was pretty big for the pasta dish. 

Service wise was not too impressed. We got a guy who seemed to be focusing a lot more on the tables that ordered wines. While he was putting black pepper on my hen, somehow the pepper shaker was aiming on my pants!!! So I got pepper all over my thighs and he didn't even notice anything!!!! And he seemed a bit rushing from my point of view. 

I think it is still a nice place to just chill at the patio during summer time...would I return?? I needa think about this...only if I get a great coupon deal then I might consider paying it another visit. 

I think it is busy for weekends, the best time to visit should be during the week...you can totally walk in without reservation."}
{"text":"Nothing Bad to say!! This place was amazing! Impeccable service, and amazing food. I brought my brother here for his birthday. We both ordered the FILETTO DI VITELLO, veal tenderloin medallions, parsnip Lyonnais and mushroom cream sauce that cost $34. Well worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We recently held our wedding (the ceremony and reception) at Tappo and it was a great experience! The staff is amazing, very open, friendly, and honest. They ensured that all of our guests were fed and fed they were! Everyone raved about the food and we had a fantastic wedding thanks to Tappo. Overall great food, great wine, and great service!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times during its first year.  Kinda stumbled upon it.  Great food, strong drinks and a reasonably priced menu.  Service is very personal and you kinda feel they want you to stay all night (and not rush you to turn a table)  The long bar adds a lot of ambiance to the place and is a notso bad spot to eat of the restaurant tables are too busy.
Check it out, you wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The food was good and the decor / feel was great. However there was a very clear mothball smell that turned me off quite a bit. They were also a bit slow (which we were ok with) however they made us feel uncomfortable near the end and rushed us out.

I had a group on deal which made it worth it. I would never go at full price."}
{"text":"Ambiance is good. Foods could be better. Service could be worse.

I enjoyed its romantic and classy ambiance but in a trendy way. Being surrounded by brick walls it was like dining at a wine cellar, which was cool. 

The foods didn't do much to match the ambiance. We had fried tomato risotto balls, salad with arugula, cheese, mushrooms, veal with cream sauce and pasta with wild boar stew-thing. Salad was good as it was really fresh. But risotto balls was weird. 

For entree I had veal, which I thought was alright but it could have been better as the meat was not as tender but sauce was good - really creamy. The pasta was also alright but nothing to write home about.

Service was meh. Our server was barely attentive, and he was never seen after taking our order. And the foods came out so slowly."}
{"text":"Dinner @ Tappo = Disappointment. We had a reservation for 9:30pm. Though we were 15 mins early, some type of acknowledgement of organized \"check in\" with a host would have been ideal.  Standing at front door was awkward.  It was 20 minutes before we were acknowledged. We finally moved to the bar for a drink & promptly advised none of the beer taps were working. So, no beer for our beaus that evening. The bartender poured the wrong wine.  Even though Cabernet Sauvignon sounds nothing like Pinot Noir.  We were finally seated at 10:30pm. All that wait to experience mediocre food and service. And considering Italian is one of my fav foods, I'm a fairly strong judge of character on this one.  I'm presuming other reviewers who gave high marks aren't locals or aren't used to dining in TO. There are MANY great restaurants in TO to choose from and would suggest checking them out. Leave your Tappo experience to sit at the bar for one cocktail JUST to appreciate the history of the walls around you. (It is Distillery District after all). And then call it a night."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Tappp just last week. I found the general feel of the restaurant to be A+. The appetizers were also great however that is about as far as that rating goes.  The service was very slow and the mains were not very good at all. I had the steak and it might have been the worst steak I have ever had at a restaurant.  

I would recommend this place for drinks and apps however wouldn't be my first choice for a nice dinner out in the distillery district."}
{"text":"While the restaurant has a nice ambiance, the service was absolutely terrible. Our waiter was rude and we had to wait long for even water to be brought to the table. We also had to wait for our payment to be processed while our waiter basically ignored our table and instead bussed and set up other tables. While we love the Distillery District, this just was a major down point."}
{"text":"Overpriced italian. I don't mind paying for a good italian meal, but this was average or below."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and delicious food, too. Enjoyed the wild mushroom soup(daily special) and the lamb(perfection!). My only critic, although the waiter was attentive and nice, over all the waiter and the owner were acting so hectic, running around, moving really fast (like in a diner) It threw me off a little. Maybe because I did not pick the place to just eat and run but to sit and relax. Other than that all went well."}
{"text":"When I call in the restaurant to make my reservation at 5 p.m. the only time available is 7:30 or 7:45 p.m..  As there is not much to do we go to the restaurant anyway at 7 p.m. preparing to hang around lining up for our table.  When we step in, the restaurant is more than half empty.  We immediately have our seat but only right in front of the entrance.  After a few minutes, sorry we cannot stand the cold as the wind comes through the door.  So we request for another table and is moved away from the entrance.  

We order soup of the day which is sausage, mushroom in a broth.  There are a lot of different spices in the soup.  It tastes good.  Most of the pasta there are pretty plain.  The Cornish hen that I order is apricot glazed served with caramelized onion bacon potato hash with green beans and a truffle jus.  When the dish comes, I found it is only half of a Cornish hen for $28.  The menu price of this restaurant compared to other fine Italian restaurants is definitely inflated, i.e., much overpriced.  I cannot taste any apricot.  The time between each serving is a long wait.  It may be good for those who come and chat and forget about their food.

The first impression is the waiter at the reservation desk is a bit weird.  I told him that we call in but no seat available earlier and their online OpenTable reservation system is down.  He insists that nothing is wrong and mumbles a lot.  

I don't think I will ever come back to this restaurant.  If I want the atmosphere of the Distillery District, there are other restaurants that I can choose from.  Generally the food quality is good but the service is so so and overpriced. I will still give it a 3 stars."}
{"text":"We've walked past Tappo a few times at the Distillery and had been wanting to try it for a while. So when they had a groupon advertised, we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to do so! We tried making reservations a few times but were always told that they had tables available before 6 PM or after 9 PM on most days. We could finally get reservations for 8.30 PM on a Thursday evening. 

When we arrived, the place was packed and we waited at least 20 mins to get seated.  We only got someone to even serve us only after 9 PM! I don't know if this is how busy they are every day or if its just poor service! We were totally put off by the service. The glasses on our table were also dirty which they promptly put away and got us some clean glasses. 

Coming to the food - we started with the arancini - quite good! For the first course, we split the ragu paparadelle - This was quite well made and the portions were good to be shared. For the main course, we got the grilled octopus and the lamb chops. Both dishes were very well made. The octopus was one of the nicest dishes Ive had in a while! 

I would go back to Tappo only if they worked on getting their service better and if I could use a groupon again. At that price point, there's as good food and much better service in many other places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Slow. Not particularly friendly. Got the Cornish hen--at $32, I thought I was getting a whole, but then only got a half...with soggy skin. Hash wasn't crispy and was overly salty. Greasy. Took forever to bring check. Dirty tablecloths."}
{"text":"Excellent food...wish the portions were a bit more...The atmosphere was really nice, would be perfect for a date.  

Make sure you buy extra time for parking....Expect to spend about 2 hours in there..the wait time for the main entree was bit longer than expected.  I ordered the seafood linguine and it was really good.  The shrimps and the scallops were really big and fresh.  We also ordered two appetizers and they were excellent.  I'm sorry I forgot what they were called because all of the menu items were in Italian but with English descriptions..

We bought a group deal which was $50 for $100 so that was perfect.."}
{"text":"Love the bar! This really is a beautiful place. Just in for a drink so not sure about food."}
{"text":"Ok place to start an afternoon on their patio. It's pretty open space in a corner of the Distillery District.  The patio is decent size and I didn't have a chance to go inside.  Honestly we didn't even have a chance to try the food because they don't serve food on the patio.

We did however sit down and enjoy a few drinks and atmosphere at Tappo.  I think the patio is a good place to start your afternoon that would lead into dinner but I can't comment on actually having dinner here."}
{"text":"Food was great. Atmosphere was amazing. This is located in an old whisky distillery. A lot of history around. Very busy, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"My date was over half an hour late (story of my life) but the wait staff made sure I was very comfortable.  I was served water and bread to keep me occupied and also asked if I wanted to order a beverage while waiting.  I liked the acknowledgment, but also liked that they didn't bother me too often.

By the time he finally showed up, I had studied the menu and wine list cover to cover.  We both decided on the Pinot Noir and shared the Antipasto Fredo (cheese, meats, olives, peppers, salmon and salad).  I also ordered the calamari to start and my date had the soup of the day - carrot with something.  He wouldn't stop talking about how great the soup was.  I loved my calamari as well.  The Antipasto platter was fantastic - a great variety of meats and cheeses, all very tasty and beautifully displayed.

For my main dish I ordered the gnocchi with pears and walnuts.  I forgot how filling gnocchi is and only finished about half my dish.  I had hoped there would be more pears in the dish, but enjoyed the bits that were there.  I also really enjoyed the texture of the walnuts in my pasta.  My date enjoyed the lamb shank (another special of the day) and had only great things to say about it.

I didn't think I deserved dessert after not finishing my meal, but we ended up ordering a tiramisu (à la mode) to share.  It was a tiny portion, but more than enough for me as I was overstuffed by this point.  The tiramisu was rich and creamy.  A great way to finish off a fantastic meal.

We were dining inside as it was drizzling rain on and off, but the patio out front is fairly large and would be great during the day for drinks.  There was also a live band outside.  They kept the door open so we also enjoyed the music, even though we couldn't see the performers."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant right in old Toronto. Our friends invited us there for dinner. I I was impressed. Loved their pasta and steak. We tried some smoked duck pasta and that was delicious. Must to try. The steak was one of the best I have ever had. Very tender and juicy. 
It's a bit pricy and portions are small so it's good to have some kind of groupon so you get lots of choice."}
{"text":"For Italian food, I have never had anything better in a restaurant, excluding all pizza-based Italian foods.  Tappo worked with my friend to arrange a last-minute wedding dinner for 48 people. She was able to book the entire restaurant within 4 weeks of her desired date. There was enough space for a small dance floor- which I fully took advantage of. 
The amazing groom set up his iPod to play the list of music, but I'm sure the restaurant usually has lovely, relaxing music.  
The menu was set for the following: 
Antipasti platter with meats, cheeses, shrimp, veggies, and smoked salmon served with fresh, soft bread. 
Pasta plate of half and half- penne with rose sauce and food-gasmic risotto with mushrooms and black truffle oil. I could really taste the truffles- YUMMMMM!
I hardly had room by this time, but managed to finish my salmon that must have been cooked in butter it was so delicious! The steak was 3 star looking, though. 
Dessert tray- I definitely had no room for anything, but I've been told the Tiramisu is the most delicious of their Italian-inspired dessert options. 
The service was amazing! And cute, too. They never let my wine glass get less than half full.  
On a typical night, I could see that they may be a little busy. 
The setting is out of this world. The stone walls and cement floor are reminiscent of the original purpose. The other features in the ceiling and for decor are a grain scale that weighs up to 25 tonnes! 
The flowers, wine rack and even the bar are gorgeous! 
If you don't have a reservation, have no reservation about sitting at the bar. You won't be disappointed. And you can't beat the outdoor fire pits, and the romance of the distillery district after sunset. A night to remember, for sure."}
{"text":"Located at distillery district in core of downtown Toronto. 
Nice, romantic environment- reminds of me old Montreal. Menu has limited selection. Authentic Italian cuisine. 

I sat at the bar, no drinks list available. It is basically whatever you want to drink I assume and you order disregarding the price. 
Restaurant was fully seated. 

Food was mediocre. Wasn't the best with flavors. I had risi e bisi. Pan-seared scallops with bomba rice (I'm not sure if it is bomba, sort of similar to Spanish kind not quite Italian short-grain rice) with leaks. There is a hint of vinaigrette with the sauce, wasn't sure if that was the sauce... or the leaks? Anyway, just had better risotto. 

My partner had a pollo pasta. Fresh pasta, sauce was good and cramy. Good portion of protein too. But then again, it is nothing spectacular that WOWed me. 

Both dishes were quite filling. We planned to go elsewhere for drinks, talks and to chill so I didn't order any wine with my meal nor did we order any desserts because we were stuffed. 

*there's like little mosquito alike bugs flying around and station themselves on the table, on your napkin or on your water glass. I didn't like that part*"}
{"text":"I finally used my groupon here. 
 I love the distillery district and all that it contains.It was a cold Friday night and it was nice and cozy in the restaurant. The waiter was really helpful and explained the menu.

We ordered: 
Octopus, shrimp, beans and salsa... VERY VERY GOOD. sometimes I hate having to share and this was one of those times!
RISOTTO with sausages- i love risotto, so i can never say no when I see it on a menu. This was really good as well... at this point i was full and we were sharing!
For mains I got the steak and dave got the chicken. Mine was really good. the white sauce on it was amazing!!! His chicken was dry, came with regular potatoes and there wasn't anything exciting about it. We ended up switching plates half way but I couldn't even eat anymore.

The wait staff was really pleasant and helpful! I will definitely come again (and sit at the bar cause everyone sitting there looked so cool! lol... like actually)"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for $55 and came here the other night to treat my father to a nice dinner. With the Groupon we got one antipasti and one primi pasta to share and one secondi pesce or carne each.  We got to choose any two person table we wanted, the first one was wobbly so we moved to the one beside it. We sat down and they explained how the menu works with the Groupon. Basically there were a couple of exclusions and they were out of gnocchi. We were also advised that they were currently in the middle of changing their wine list so when we were ready to order I asked our server what she would recommend as a white wine in the $40-$50 price range for seafood as we were both having seafood in our mains. She recommended a sauvignon blanc from Chile and promptly brought it to our table to let us try. I generally like white wine from Chile so I knew I would probably like it and I did.

For the food we ordered the tagliere di casa and the bucatini to share, and the salmone al braccio and the terra e mare as our mains. First we were given a basket of bread and a little plate with oil and vinegar. Then came the charcuterie board with a selection of meat that included proscuitto and two salamis, one regular and one hot with three pieces of each. There was also one type of cheese and some peppers that were tasty. Can't comment on the olives though, as neither of us like them. The bucatini pasta was served already split into two bowls with bacon and pecorino cheese in a spicy tomato sauce. Upon serving we were asked if we wanted parmesan cheese, pepper and chili flakes. We said yes to all and it was very good, although we decided it was very good as a split portion and we probably wouldn't want to eat any more than what we had in our bowls. Finally, our mains, the seafood smelled delicious as it came out of the kitchen to our table. I really enjoyed my atlantic salmon, it was cooked perfectly and the tomato and onion relish on top was the perfect accompaniment. The veal medallions came with only one shrimp and two scallops in a white wine cream sauce. Minus the fact that there was only one shrimp, the dish itself was very good as well. As you can tell there was no room for dessert.  

The service was really good, maybe too good since we basically had 3 servers all night which means we were interrupted more than we needed to be to answer the same questions. Overall, our experience was really good. I enjoyed the service, the food, and the overall setting of Tappo Wine Bar & Restaurant. If it wasn't for the Groupon, I probably would have never found this place and it's good food, but I don't know if I would come back and pay full price."}
{"text":"I think the food is wonderful and the restaurant itself is beautiful. 

However, the staff aren't the nicest of people and there is one waiter there that scares me. He is scattered, jittery, jumpy, and generally out of it. We saw him spin in circles while standing in the same spot. Then he lost my credit card and another server found it outside on a ledge of the patio at the front of the restaurant...

He is a huge put off on the experience when we go there. Otherwise I like the place."}
{"text":"I can't help but love any place that is located in the Distillery district of Toronto. It may be my favourite place to go and have a meal or check out a play... So when last weekend when one of my girlfriends was celebrating her birthday and I found out the location of the restaurant... I had to check it out. 

We were a group of 10 and or and we had an 8pm reservation. The place was so busy and the atmosphere in restaurant was so warm and cozy. I love the exposed brick in the place (don't love how slippery the floors are though by the bathroom.. I almost fell and one of my girlfriends did actually slip)... 

Their wine list is extensive (don't like wine? try their cesars.. delicious) and the food is unbelieveable - I had the cheese tortellini ala vodka and it was so fabulous..

Most of their servers are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. - on  that note though, there was an individual who I am not sure what his job was at the place but he kept falling all over one of my girlfriends.. touching her - at one point he even put his face in her breasts ... very inappropriate... and kept bugging her and us for that matter .. we are the kind of crowd that take things in stride so we didn't sweat it but it was highly inappropriate and I don't think that server, host whatever the heck he was should be working at such a brilliant space.

Don't let me distract you though from checking out a gem in the heart of Toronto though... the food and wine alone will have you going back over and over again."}
{"text":"at first glance i liked the vibe of this place-classy, romantic ambience that really set the mood for the evening. 

we ordered the pork belly appetizer which was actually quite good; the portion was fairly big and pan-seared perfectly, not too fatty but not skimping on the meat either. It sat on top of kale slaw which complemented the pork belly nicely. The bread basket was unfortunately quite cold and stale though, probably because they were so busy on a friday night. For the mains, my boyfriend ordered the Alberta striploin while I opted for the mahi-mahi. Don't get the mahi-mahi. The striploin came out pretty well, exactly how my boyfriend ordered it (medium rare). Unfortunately i couldn't say the same for the mahi-mahi....the fish itself was alright if not bland, and the sauce it came with did not help matters at all.

I have to say though, the service was quite good given the fact that they were so busy. we did have to wait a bit for our food, but we never had to ask for water refills, which i often find is not the case with other restaurants. 

In short, ambience=4 stars, food=3 stars, service=3 stars."}
{"text":"I went to Tappo on Tuesday night with a girlfriend. I had a coupon ($30 for $70)

We thoroughly enjoyed the experience at Tappo. The wine list was impressive, and the service was excellent.  I can not say enough nice things about our server.  The restaurant was packed and he was still attentive, friendly and helpful.

My friend and I shared: 
Octopus salad - Tasty but could have been a bit fresher
A pasta dish with wild boar - This was delicious (wish I could remember the name)
The lamb - Cooked to perfection, tender and juicy but slightly under seasoned. 

Our total, with the deal, tip and and $50 bottle of wine was  $170 (around $200 sans deal.)

I would definitely come back to Tappo  if I had a deal, but I don't know if I would have been as satisfied had I paid full price, as I don't  feel the food was amazing enough to be at that price point."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and the food was amazing!  The waiters were so helpful and friendly.  I had to change my reservation about 5times due to weather and some cancellations.  In the end, myself and the other people who showed up had a lovely meal.  I highly recommend it!  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular lunch !! The salmon with vegatbles was perfectly cooked, and the gnocchi was wonderfully seasoned.  Of course if you are a balsamic vinegar and olive oil lover, the endless bread basket with full bottles of each are really nice. Waistaff was efficient, atmosphere outstanding.  The best place to visit at the Distillery. Loved it, wouldn't hesitate to go back or highly recommend."}
{"text":"I actually spent New Years Eve at Tappo this year. I had a wonderful time. I didn't get to eat at this place but I look forward to going back and enjoying the menu. The decor is very nice and the staff was friendly even on such a busy and difficult night to work on. I would definitely recommend looking into this place for special events as well as regular dinner night."}
{"text":"Its now 9:30, still waiting for our 8:30 reservation. Ugh.
So, 9:45 we finally get the table we had reserved for 8:30. A little complimentary prosecco was a nice gesture. The apps came quickly: beef carpaccio and pork belly were both very nice. The pasta choose was nice, although I thought the gnocchi was better than the seafood linguini (a little under salted). The mains took a little longer than expected, but both the steak and the lamb were perfectly cooked. A complimentary dessert platter was another nice touch. 
 Over all the food was good not great. The wait was intolerable. If we hadn't been going on a travel zoo voucher we wouldn't have waited. Did the food make the wait worthwhile? Hell no! Will we go back again? Hell no!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:45 and didn't get a, table till 10pm. Waited 1.5 hrs till my family got appetizers. My whole family was pissed and yelling at waiter coz of the long wait.  I will not recommend this place to anyone.  It will cause a lot of family bickering for long wait and hunger"}
{"text":"Tucked away at the back of the distillery district, this quaint Italian spot has a unique rustic vibe to it - what you would expect from a restaurant in the distillery. While the space itself is nice, the food was far from what I was hoping for. For my main I had the special for that day, venison served on rapini with a red wine reduction. The staff was very accommodating when I asked for a side of risotto. Overall, underwhelming. The risotto was flavorless and the red wine reduction was burnt. The venison was cooked properly and tasted good, but the sauce ruined the dish. I'm pushing this to 3 stars because the wine list was great and we may have just hit on an off night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful! It has an incredibly intimate setting and upon walking in, I declared I wanted my wedding there - despite already having a deposit put towards another venue. 

The food was fantastic. The gnocchi was incredibly light and the portion size was perfect. Our server recommended a fantastic bottle of wine after I indicated my taste and the tiramisu was to die for. 

Besides the door being impossible to open I absolutely adored this place and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for a friends' birthday. Reservations were made for 7:30 for 9 ppl. 4 of us arrived first, our table was ready, except there's no host so we just had to flag someone down to tell them we had reservations....and they just pointed to the table and told us to sit. Took awhile to even get water...and when our glasses were being poured, they were in such a rush my friend got splashed on. When the rest of our party arrived, we sat around for 20 minutes before we finally decided we have to ask to get some menus. another 20 minutes later we flagged someone down to take our orders. (Later on, we over heard another waiter telling the table behind us the specials...and we realized we never got them..prob cuz we never asked for them?) Appetizers came at a reasonable rate. But at about 9pm we decided to asked someone to check on our orders...and they returned to tell us they are working on one more table's food before ours. Then we finally got our food at 9:30....5 minutes after the table behind us who was a party of about 6 ppl and came at 8:30. At least my pasta was hot, but on the menu it was linguine, and it came as spaghetti....and when i mentioned it, the server said the kitchen was too busy to tell the servers they ran out of linguine...but whatever, at that point i just wanted to be fed. My dish was average. My friend ordered the pasta with quail, it tasted bland and burnt. The veal was tough, but had a tasty sauce. The rack of lamb that the birthday girl ordered was good though...altho there was as much fat on the bone as there was meet. After everyone's food arrived, we asked for the bill right away while we were still eating because we weren't planning on staying there all night! It took them 20 minutes to take our credit card, and another 20 minutes to bring it back. After all that, we got a round of complementary shots, and a tiramisu for the bday girl......but to be honest, we wouldn't have accepted if it wasn't our friend's birthday. So overall, do not go on a busy night, the service is horrible and the food is mediocre. Broiler House and Pure Spirits were better, no doubt!"}
{"text":"This was the friends choice for her Valentines Dinner.  We had reservations for 8PM. On our way it began snowing which added some romantic ambiance to the evening and upon arriving at the location they had their pit fires burning keeping people outside warm. Thats pretty much where the \"Romantic\" part of the evening left off. We entered the building to hear rock music playing, and witness throngs of people milling about everywhere. It was not extraordinarily busy, a handful of tables open and a few spots at the bar. We gave the server our names and were shown to our table. I would like to say it was a nice spot, however it was not. It was the table right next to the large boiler furnace off to the left of the entry way, and my chair was so close to the guy sitting behind me that neither of us could leave our tables without hitting the other one.  We slowly inched the table away from him in order to make more room. This did put my friend in the middle of the walkway giving the servers less space to move, but if they had a problem with this, they sure didn't show it. Something irked me is that I noticed the host was taking the coats of people coming in and hanging them up. I saw no discernible difference between how they were dressed and myself. They had coats, I had a coat, they had a dress shirt, I had a dress shirt.  The more I noticed him actually doing this to everyone walking in, made me a little upset that I had to set my jacket beside me because there was no room on the back of my chair due to the proximity of the other patron. 

We both decided on an appetizer each to start the meal, She ordered the Antipasto Fredo, and myself with the Carpaccio Di Manzo, for Entrees, She chose the Gnocchi Di Spinaci E Ricotta al Gogonzola, and I went with the Terra E Mare. 

After ordering I would imagine we could have been talking about how romantic things were and how the place had a very cozy feel to it, however this particular night we were listening to creed playing in the background. We made the best of our time between shifting the table back and forth and talking about the various plates of food we saw passing us. It all looked excellent and smelled even better. Ten minutes later  a very large plate was sat down on the table taking up most of it, it was my friends appetizer,  with the size of the plate I assumed that mine would come out next due to us not really having enough room for both. Everything was fantastic, the salad, the meats, cheeses, olives (I dislike olives), even the smoked salmon tasted great. By far a great start. I took notice to the owner (Hockey) making rounds to tables inquiring to each person asking them how the meals were and how they were enjoying themselves. Until he got to our table, which he skipped over. Point lost. I know what you may be thinking, we hadn't had our meals so there was no point in him stopping by, well 2 other tables he stopped at, didn't even have their waters yet. 

Oh well, before I had a chance to speak our Italian whisked the plate away and suddenly we were staring at our dinner plates. Setting aside the fact I am missing my app, the dinners had a great presentation to them and once again, excellent aroma. I was slightly taken aback by my dish since what I read was not in front of me, \"Veal Medallions\", what I was looking at was a piece of veal over potatoes, scallops and shrimp arranged around the plate. Sure it didn't look like what I imagined, however it tasted very good. The scallops were a tad rubbery but everything else made up for it. The gnocchi side of things were being gobbled up with gumption, she really enjoyed it. We finished off our plates and the server asked if there would be deserts on order. We made the point about missing the appetizer and she said the kitchen was very busy and must have missed it, so in order to make up for it, she gave us a free order of Tiramisu and apologized for the mistake. 

All in all this was a good Valentines dinner for the both of us. Slight problems throughout the evening but we didn't let them dampen our spirits, only this review."}
{"text":"\"Wooden interior, with old granite stone walls and metal equipment from the buildings industrial past set up a great atmosphere for all their wine cellars.\"
\"I quite liked the organic table set up as well as the simple chairs and white tablecloths - made me feel like I am in Italy - history around, simplicity at hand. Lets hope the food adds its final touch too.\"

This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"I went there for the second time using a Buytopia voucher.  Just like the first time we went, the food was pretty good but it takes forever to get your meal.  It took one hour and a half to get our main course.  Also, I purchased a voucher for a 3-course meal.  Well, 2 of these courses were shared.  This should be spelled out on the voucher."}
{"text":"I dined here on the weekend with my family we had a groupon voucher. I had been here once before and it won't be back again. The food quality was inconsistent and the service was beyond terrible. From the moment we stepped through the door... I truly don't understand how or why they haven't been able to improve these issues when all of the reviews have been saying the same thing. How long is it going to take them to realize they need to make some serious changes?!"}
{"text":"Tough place to review. Several extremes...

Extremely good: Service! Hosts! Food! Imaginative Menu! Wine! The space itself!

Extremely perplexing: No beer! Missing menu items on a slow night. Expensive. Asked for guests to pay in cash due to \"network down\"."}
{"text":"Intimate and nice rustic ambiance. The food and service mediocre at best. They are severely understaffed, ie. bar staff and maitre d' double as servers and even then it takes an ungodly amount of time to get a drink, food, bill etc.   By the time the standard fare dishes arrive you realize the wait was just not worth it, saving grace is if you have a half off groupon , pity the poor unknowing patrons ordering at regular menu prices.  The unique setting can't save all its other major shortcomings. Underwhelmed is how I felt, even at half off. Also bring cash, their ATM AND POS is \"down\" frequently as other posters have mentioned."}
{"text":"Just came back from a weekend visit to Toronto and I made it a point to stop by the Distillery district to have lunch when we stumbled upon this restaurant. It's a really nice looking restaurant and on a Friday afternoon it was practically empty. My friend ordered the gnocchi (which he said was good) and I ordered the spicy sausage penne pasta which was good but nothing to write home about. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it. There were about 4 or 5 small pieces of sausage in my pasta. I'll give them credit for the really attentive service we received."}
{"text":"Romantic restaurant in a romantic setting (the Distillery District).  Service here is good and the ambiance is perfect to mark a special occasion or for a date.  Came here with a Groupon special so the meal was definitely a value proposition, but ordinarily it would've quite a pricey meal.  You can probably find a better Italian restaurant in Toronto, but if you're looking to make an evening in the Distillery neighborhood and want a romantic setting, Tappo would be a great choice."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for my dads birthday and the first thing we noticed was the decor inside the restaurant. It didn't look particularly pretty on the outside but was very interesting with distillery feel on the inside.

The waiter was very friendly and served us right after we sat down. There was very little wait time between sitting and getting the menu to actually ordering. My dad ordered the krombacher lager and the waiter accidentally gave us the wheat beer instead. We didn't notice much since my dad loved the wheat beer so much. However, the waiter came with another beer, giving us a huge shock because we didn't order two. He explained that he gave us the wrong beer and apologized and gave the lager to us for free. Super nice and totally unexpected. 

We had the groupon and ordered the carpaccio and one of the intaladas to start. Both were delicious and great to share. The next thing we ordered was the second starter: pappardelle and the seafood linguine. The pasta was aldente and not too oily and salty. 

The entrees were more disappointing than the starters. I definitely did not like them and neither did my family. 

We ordered the lamb, octopus, salmon and mahi mahi. All of which were too salty and the salsa was too sour for the octopus, and it did not compliment the octopus. 

I loved the service and the atmosphere, but if you were here to have a really good and delicious meal, I wouldn't recommend this place: especially for a special occasion since they don't do birthday cakes or surprise desserts. It was around $20-25 for an app and $35-40 for the entree."}
{"text":"Tappo is so romantic but not pretentious. Perfect for a dinner date. i loved the charming brick walls. love the atmosphere. 

for app, we had calamari, marinated in lemon-cilantro, brandy citrus sauce and charred tomato-avocado salsa & grilled portobello mushroom on a bed of arugula salad with goat cheese. calamari was perfectly cooked, so tender but not mushy. i loved the sauce it was marinated with. but the portobello!! SOO good! esp w the goat cheese! we might be bias tho cuz we loveee portobello.

for entree, i had the gnocchi. ricotta-spinach gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream
sauce with caramelized pears and roasted walnut. OMG. secretly, i dont really like italian food. i find pasta boring & plain. maybe its cuz i never had real authentic italian italian food yet. but THIS!!! this gnocchi dish was delish!! sooooooo good, possibly the best gnocchi ive ever had (altho i havent tried that many) !! so creamy, so flavorful! i didnt really care about the walnut, but the little pieces of pear! i wish there were more! the bf had the lamb. ALL other restaurants should learn how to cook lamb like how they do at tappo!! he ordered it as medium and medium it came out,still so juicy and tender, NOT dry and chewy! perfect proportion of meat vs. fat. lamb was good, but what REALLY impressed me were the veggies that came w it. they were the most PERFECTLY cooked veggies ive ever had. HOW do you make your veggies like that?! 

i really really liked tappo. the best italian ive yet to try. romantic candle lit setting, unpretentious, perfect food, perfect portion.. theres nothing else i need. :)"}
{"text":"I used to work as a line cook for an Italian restaurant. So I am anal about Italian food. This place was good. I had the food risottos which was not the best but still worth it. I tried the rest of our parties food (being foodies we share) and it was good. The price was a bit high but average prices for a restaurant in the Distillery District in Toronto. But the one experience that made this place a class act was the customer service experience. Had reservations for 8:30. But the party b4 was running late. No issues with us. We said we would wait. They could not get us the table in time so they quickly set something outside. AND they gave the first round of drinks on them. There was 10 of us. Very nice of them. We did not complain or ask for it. Also the servers we very good. Energetic and great at telling what was good and describing it."}
{"text":"Tappo is simple but so nice. It makes for a great lunch spot in the Distillery District.

I wasn't looking for anything heavy and since it was a cool day outside, soup sounded like the perfect choice. They had an egg drop soup on special that sounded good, so I went with that. It didn't disappoint one bit. My mom also chose a special: the garlic and olive oil pasta. She raved about it through the day, and still to this day will bring it up if we talk about our Canadian vacation. She really liked that dish.

Oh, and for the most important part? We chose glasses of Riesling to accompany our meal. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Firstly I want to say, booking reservations is a hassle. They have several weddings and special events, especially during weekends so don't have a set date on coming to tappos. 
But with so many special events held there that means it has to be good right? WELL ITS ACTUALLY BETTER. 

Me and my boyfriend went there on a Tuesday night with reservations made the same day. When we got to the location in the heart I the distillery district, it was literally packed to the rim. 

This is what we ordered: 
Antipasti: costatine di bisonte
SO GOOD. The meat was really tender and the portions were more than I thought they were. 

Pasti: spaghetti alle vongole veraci
Essentially clams, cherry tomatoes, and parsley in spaghetti. I'm not a huge fan of spaghetti but this one is iight. Not one of the worst.

Main: bistecca di manzo all espresso
ie) beef striploin with a side of potatoes and a red wine/espresso reduction. The sauce was amaaaazing and the beef steak was perfectly tender. It's honestly excellent food and my photo doesn't do it justice. 

Our entire meal was tip top for Italian cuisine (but then again I'm not too experienced in that department). 

The servers were more attentive later on the evening when the restaurant started to clear up a bit. 

The atmosphere is beautiful. This is where you would take a date if you wanted to impress them and be all fancy shmancy. 
Personally, the prices are way over my wallet for an everyday thing, but it's a gem in the distillery."}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner using a voucher. The service was great and the decor is beautiful. However the food was not to expectations. I had ordered a delicious risotto and that was a fantastic dish. However the octopus after that was very salty and tough. My family agreed over all that the food was too salty and seemingly cooked in a rush. Great place for a nice dinner but not great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Even with a reservation for 5 people at 8pm we waited nearly an hour for our table....BUT we did score a seat on one of the couches outside while we waited, and once we made our displeasure known to the manager, he graciously offered us cocktails and bruschetta on the house.

Anyhow, the interior at Tappo has a cozy bistro ambiance and the outside has a large patio with a view to the industrial splendour that is the Distillery District.

I actually enjoyed my meal immensely...hubby and I shared the fish of the day (pickerel with lemon-butter sauce) and the orecchiete pasta with tomatoes. Both were truly delicious. 

Overall I liked this spot...it feels authentically Italian, even down to the cute waiter named Luca with the beautiful bushy eyebrows; and the cocktail waiter who kept saying \"allora\" and \"prego\" which brought me back to Italy for a moment. Charming! :)"}
{"text":"Just an incredible experience from an impulse group on. Took my family here from out of town and had a very memorable night out. Service was top notch and the food was incredible. The atmosphere is really unique for Toronto and sets the appropriate mood. Loved Sylva as our server. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ya, it's Italian food. The menu has some eye catching options, there was some thought and it shows.

For a restaurant located inside a tourist attraction, it was still very nice. At least it looks really nice, a great first impression maker. And with pasta what more do you need then atmosphere anyway?

The service was amusing (the guys were a bit neurotic), but very professional. I felt very taken care of. As I usually do in nicer Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"This review is going to sound bad if you are just skimming through, so you won't understand my 3/5 star rating unless you actually read thoroughly...

A group of us went to Tappo for our office Christmas party. There were 10 of us and we made reservations 3 weeks in advance because we know how busy the holiday season can get. When we arrived there were no tables available, but we were told that we would be seated shortly. Just shy of 2 hours after our reservation time we were finally seated at a table instead of just crowding around the bar. While it gave us something to gripe about, it did not dampen our spirits or our fun at all because that is just the way our staff is. And naturally 2 hours of drinks would make anyone happy.

While eating some appetizers and drinking our livers away at the bar, we ordered our mains when we were told that we would have a table in about 15-20 minutes (after over an hour and a half of waiting of course). A large percentage of us ordered the Filetto Di Manzo Alla Griglia (pan seared and peppercorn crusted 8oz beef tenderloin, herbed mashed potatoes, fine green beans and a gorgonzola tarragon cream). Unfortunately we were told a few minutes later that they were out of the tenderloin, so all of us switched to the Costata Di Vitello Alla Griglia (grilled 14oz veal chop served with garlic mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, rosemary truffle jus). Very shortly after being seated the food arrived which was nice as we had been there over 2 hours already and were quite hungry from a long day.

At first bite, the veal chop was amazing. I don't know about everyone else's, but mine was perfectly medium rare and quite juicy. The spices and the meat, were a very amazing flavour that just melted in my mouth...that made the wait more worth it. The moment of the first couple bites was the first time there was silence in our large group since we arrived as we all savoured in the taste (and finally being able to eat). When the silence was broken, even those that did not order the veal were raving about how good their individual dishes were. We knew right then that it was a good choice in restaurant.

It was a little hard to get the wait staff's attention after they cleared the plates and we were ready for dessert. We were told twice that someone would be over to inform us of the desserts since they change all the time and there is no set menu. We pestered the staff enough that eventually they decided to just send over a couple platters which consisted of tiramisu and brownie-like chocolate cake. Just like the main course, it was well worth the wait because it was so good that it was gone in seconds.

There were of course circumstances which caused us to wait, and it happens, and we were adequately taken care of for the troubles. They of course lose points because of the troubles, but the food really made up for it all. Probably on a different night or with a smaller group it would have been a different situation. If the place is packed when you arrive, you might want to turn around right then. But if you get a seat, you will love what is served!"}
{"text":"Despite having issues opening their front door (which could have been the fault of my travel partner and I having drinks prior) everything after that was pure awesomeness.  We headed to the bar as we were not interested in food, it was my first and last night in T.O. and i wanted to drank!! 

The Mixologist of the night name was Neil they dont do cocktail menus you describe what you want or like and he mixes shit up for you!  I liked his vibe right off the bat.

 My friend got some manly  \"makes you grow chest hair\" drink and after hearing what I like (champagne bubble with a kick) Neil whipped me up a Negroni...I ended up not liking it because I'm a punk but the way he made it was so artful I tried to force myself to drown it.  Upon further research on Negroni's I found it is compared to Campari's and I knew for a fact I hated those!  Neil noticed my distaste, gave my drink to my friend for free and made me something less adventurous by my request. 

What made me rate it a 5 star is being  Neil and other personnel were uber friendly, telling us the late night spots to attend while in Toronto even giving us info about a speak-easy bar located behind a freezer of a restaurant!   

Good vibes and good times!"}
{"text":"I came with a voucher. That's how I discovered this place. 
The deal comes with one appetizer one pasta, and two mains. 
Appetizer was the beef carppacio. The beef was really thin, dish was very oily. Not feeling it.
Pasta was the mushroom cream papperdelle. This was excellent. I'm still thinking about this one.
Our mains were the beef tenderloin. It was suppose to be medium rare but came out medium well. The cut wasn't the best and honestly, I would not pay regular price for it. It was pretty flat and priced at $44. Unless they are using this cut just because I have a voucher because otherwise, the plate itself should only be priced at about $20-25. 
Overall it was an okay experience. The atmosphere was nice, almost has a winery feel to it. The service is decent, but the food is not very good"}
{"text":"I would probably have given this a 3.5 if that was possible. The food was very good and worthy of 4 stars (I rarely give 5 - because that implies near perfection). The restaurant itself was beautiful and the distillery distract was all dressed up nicely like a scene out of a Christmas Carol. We both had fish . The black cod in a puttanesca sauce was delicious and the special that day halibut in a butter sauce was also very good. We had a Sauv Blanc from NZ and it was good as expected.

The two things that landed Tappo in 3 star territory was the price - like all places in the distillery, too high for the quality  - and also the waiter while pleasant and available seemed a bit fake or at least not entirely genuine or happy to be there.

Nonetheless worth a try and a great place for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Tappo is in a beautifully restored stone industrial building in the distillery district. Dinner started very well. The antipasto was very good. All very high quality meats, cheeses, olives ect. Around the time we were half way into our starters the kitchen extractor fan stopped working and the restaurant filled with smoke. At this point the staff pretended  not to notice until we asked what was going on. We complained and all they did was comp our desert. If I wasn't there for a work event I would have walked out because the manager handled this so poorly. The rest of the food was ok but expected much better at this price point. I would recommend going for a drink to admire the setting. But not a Bellini because they don't use real peach purée. Odd for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited Tappo as I got a Groupon at a good deal.  The food was nice and portion sizes are what you would expect.  I would not pay their full price for the food though.  The service was on and off, our server was stand offish at first and got a bit warmer towards us nearer the end.  It's a cute restaurant in the Distillary District and I loved the ambiance, tables are a little close together for my liking but not the worst either.  I was there on a Tuesday right at 5pm when it opened and while we were the first one's there it got busy quick. 

Wait times for food were also pretty good. This place is worth a visit, be nice for a date."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that restaurants in Toronto continue to serve Chilean sea bass, which is a species that is vulnerable to overfishing and which is often fished illegally. 

Aside from that, I came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. It was empty and the waiter, while polite, was clearly disappointed that he had to serve us when he was hoping for a long break. 

We started with the arugula salad that had the prosecco vinaigrette. The poached pear was alright but didn't stand out. Since my partner and I are both vegetarian, we requested both mains to be vegetarian - they were able to make the risotto without rabbit meat. The roasted corn in the risotto didn't seem quite so roasted though - still tasty. The butternut squash ravioli with sage was a bit off - overly sweet. Decent but nothing was exactly outstanding or memorable.

The interior is nice but smaller than what I expected. The service was minimal and not exactly sincere. We still tipped 20% since we just didn't want to wait for change. 

Not likely to come back.

2.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here after purchasing a deal voucher and I think that might have had an impact on the service I received here, but I can't be sure. Overall I don't think I'd recommend this place over any others in the Distillery District. There are so many great restaurants here and they all have beautiful architecture, so they need to work really hard to stand out with amazing food and/or superb service. 

I had to ask for a bread basket, and what seemed like attentive service soured when I was informed by my ever-present server that my table was reserved for another party an hour and a half after my reservation, and that I only had an hour left. Since my dinner date was late, I felt dinner was a bit rushed when she arrived and we ordered immediately.  

I ordered the beef Carpaccio as an appetizer with gnocchi as a main; both of these were good but the gnocchi could definitely have used more of the crispy pear slices (there was only one).  I think the pricing is pretty steep, considering the quality and presentation of the food here. It isn't terrible, but like I said, it needs to stand out more in an area like this.

Bathrooms are extremely tiny (forgivable considering the limitations of Victorian-era plumbing), but they smelled a bit musty. I would not want to be in there in the summertime."}
{"text":"great looking restaurant.  terrible service and poorly made food.  we ordered the octopus appetizer and it was burnt.  the tomato sauce in the pappadelle was greasy for some reason and overly salty.  the sausage in the risotto was tasteless.  service was slow and unattentive.  over priced for the food quality.   I wouldn't return and dont recommend it."}
{"text":"We were running late so had to change our reservation, no problem, very accommodating.  The area is very nice, the restaurant has lots of charm.  My issue is paying $26 for egg ribbon pasta and mushrooms, seriously??  WAY over priced, I don't mind paying for good food but the Pappardelle was just mediocre I've had better and paid way less.  Then when we go to pay their internet is down so they are only accepting cash.  I don't carry cash so I had to use their ATM on site and pay a $2 fee (thanks Tappo).   I won't be back again."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon voucher and went to this restaurant with my friend. First the food was delicious and plentiful (our voucher included an antipasta to share, a primi pasta to share and each ANOTHER entree). The decor was exactly what I would want to see in the distillery district and unique and interesting (loved the expose brick). The service was great. The wine we ordered was not available so our server recommended a wine but my friend didn't like it so she recommended another which was very tasty. The server was very graceful about taking the opened, undesirable bottle of wine back and getting another (even gave us the more expensive wine at our original requests price.) Another server at another establishment could've become agitated at having the wine sent back. 
It was good service, great food and really great atmosphere I definitely would recommend for a night with a friend or bf/gf or maybe a place where I would take my parents. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it is on the more expensive side, I doubt that I would've been able to go here without the voucher."}
{"text":"I took my out of town relatives to this restaurant, thinking the food will reflect the rustic restaurant decor and ambiance, BOY WAS I WRONG!! The food was horrible along with their service and prices were through the roof! We all went out for pizza after! Worse food in Distillery!"}
{"text":"After a shaky start to my night at Tappo, they really pulled it around for a great evening. 

I made reservations online, and received a confirmation email - unfortunately when I showed up, they had no record of my reservation. Alas. Fortunately, at 10:30pm on a Saturday they aren't that busy, so we were able to get a table no problem. 

To start, I really like the intimate feel of the restaurant - it would be a great date spot. Their menus are kind of horrendous though - they remind me of some old fashioned small-town restaurant. They do have a large wine list - I would have been devastated if they didn't - with varying prices in everyone's budget.

As for the meal itself, the food was absolutely delicious. We split two appetizers, the shrimp one and the cured meat platters, which were great, and both had a pasta. My penne a la vodka was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was just the right amount of creamy. 

When it came to dessert, we ordered the panacotta, but unfortunately they had run out. Instead they brought us the flourless chocolate cake and the tiramisu, as well as two shots of lemoncello, all on the house! I love restaurants who can recover from errors - great customer service. 

The service was overall fantastic - while it was a bit pricey, it was definitely on par with the caliber of the food. I can't say I'll be back soon (hey, I can't afford it!) but I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Very nice trendy yet traditional restaurant in old Toronto. Price is high but it is a good place to celebrate something with a few friends. The steak and veal is amazing. The seafood is nothing special so stick with the real meat. 

Yes the service is slow, that is what high class restaurants do. If you are in a rush, why are you here in the first place? This is a sit back and relax joint."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a beautiful atmosphere. We went on a Friday night and it was absolutely packed. Luckily we had a reservation and I HIGHLY recommend you make one too if you decide to visit. The staff were very nice and made sure we got a side table. The restaurant is basically one big room with a bar so it's best to request a table along the wall if you don't want to be stuck in the middle of the crowd. It took a while to be greeted though but it was understandable with their amount of staff and how busy they were. I ordered a mushroom pasta which was delicious. For the vegetarians out there you do have options! :) I also ordered their last bottle of rosé which was amazing. Highly recommended! overall great time and I highly recommend visiting even just to see the beautiful decor and old building."}
{"text":"We went for a date night dinner, just the two of us, and used a Groupon. The atmosphere was lovely - very romantic. When we received our menus we were amused at the large, bold \"GROUPON\" written across the one-page prix fixe menu; to make sure everyone knew we were there on the cheap, I suppose! The food was fine, although we thought it strange that we were required to choose the same first course (they explained that it was a shared course, but we each received our own plated helping of the same dish). The second course options didn't include anything vegetarian, so I asked if something was available. Our server (the owner, I believe), said the chef would make me something, but declined to tell me what it would be, assuring me I would like whatever he made. I'll eat pretty much anything if it's meatless, but thought this was a bit odd, especially when I asked a second time and again was told it would be a surprise. We shared a lovely bottle of wine, unfortunately when the bill came they had overcharged us $20 for the bottle, although the mistake was corrected.
Overall, the food was pretty good, but the service not quite up to par, and the pricing seemed a bit over the top, even with our Groupon."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I've always wanted to try this restaurant - it has a huge patio that's right in the centre of The Distillery District and it's always packed, so I figured that it must be good, right? Wrong. I jumped on the Groupon deal when it came up (I paid $100 for 4 people, we each had a three-course meal) and thank goodness for that! The dishes (taste, quality, presentation) was definitely not worth the prices that they were charging on the menu. We started off with the antipasti dish - Costatine di bisonte ($20) braised bison short ribs served on savoy cabbage with an Amarone reduction. All that was on the plate was one piece of rib that my husband and I had to share. Next was the pasta - pappardelle ai porcini ($26) egg ribbon pasta tossed in a white wine garlic butter
sauce, porcini mushroom garnished with freshly grated pecorino chesse. While we did share this dish, they did put each portion in a separate plate. The pasta tasted great (fresh and was likely made in the restaurant), and the fresh parmesan was a nice touch. Lastly, it was the main dish. I ordered the polipo alla griglia ($36) twice cooked octopus on a sautéed rapini and topped with salsa verde, while my husband ordered the bistecca di manzo all'espresso ($44) a 10oz \"AAA\" Alberta beef striploin served on a bed of Lyonnaise potatoes with an espresso and red wine reduction. The octopus was bland (I've had better at dim sum), the salsa verde was a green pile of mush, and the rapini was overcooked. The striploin was definitely not worth $44 (if I had to pay the regular price). All-in-all, I would NEVER GO BACK! If you're in the Distillery District and are looking for some good grub, it's better to head over to the Mill Street Brew Pub or Pure Spirits Oyster House."}
{"text":"Coles notes version: to call this place a tourist trap would be a compliment. 


I wouldn't even give this place a star...it would be too generous. My gf bought one of those zoo travel deals so we went on the last possible day before it expired. Had high hopes. From the second we walked in the door, the bad vibes begun. 

1) It took over 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge our presence. When someone finally did, he was rude and even served someone that walked in after us first. We informed him politely but he ignored the information, and just told everyone waiting (3 couples total) that it wouldn't be long. +15 mins later we gave up and decided to eat at the bar. We informed the host who replied with: \"Sure! Sit at the bar...look at me, I'd like to have a drink too and would do that too!\" 

2) Took another 10-15 minutes for anyone at the bar to even acknowledge our presence. Someone that looked like the owner or manager was there, cleaning cutlery from a big green bucket. Didn't even smile or attempt to serve us or even bring us menus. Finally, a nice bartender who had just come in to start his shift helped us. He was the highlight of the night. 

3) We told him we were there for the travel zoo promo and he said they were working off the normal menu tonight. That means: 1 antipasti, 1 pasta and each diner gets 1 Secondi dish. We thought: great!!! These guys must be generous! Maybe there's hope for this place yet! Let's order some drinks. 

4) drinks ordered. My drink smells like a dirty dish rag. Lovely. 

5) antipasti - carpaccio - good. Nothing to complain about here. It's really hard to mess this up. 

Pasta - ordered the Papradelle with mushrooms. It took over 30 mins for this come out. When it was served, I noticed it wasn't Paradelle. Turned out, they ran out. Either way, I have to admit it was mighty tasty. Only 3 forks worth but that's ok. 

Secondi - Gf ordered scallops and shrimp over Israeli couscous. What came out was ok but it wasn't couscous. It was rice. The kind you get in a box. 

Me - chicken, Jerusalem artichokes , honey balsamic reduction. Chicken was under cooked. The \"Jerusalem artichokes\" were undercooked diced potatoes, and it was a jus and not honey and balsamic reduction. Too add insult to injury, it was completely flavourless. No salt. So seasoning. Horrible. 

6) my gf last drink had a pubic hair in it. Please see picture as proof. 

7) 3 course meal - took over 2 hours. It was obvious the kitchen was getting slammed but it was ridiculous to see the staff not caring whatsoever and just treating customers as idiots. 

8) if you want to pay by credit card, their machines are broken. Apparently, this seems to be a running theme. Cash only. There's a cash machine conveniently located in the restaurant. Can anyone say: tax evasion? Give me a break. 

9) I went to the washroom. It was remarkably clean. And then I saw the sink. Both handles of the faucets were completely torn off and one faucet was just running without any way to turn it off. At least I got to wash my hands but I got the feeling that this was the act of a pissed off customer.

10) someone that looked like the owner/manager's friend came in and sat beside us at the bar. He got his food at least 3x as quickly as anyone else. 

I normally don't write reviews but this place was so bad, it doesn't even deserve to be on that piece of shit show Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. 

Not only was this the worst restaurant I've ever been to in Toronto, its the worst restaurant I've been to worldwide. 

Two words to sum up: Stay away."}
{"text":"This review of Tappo Wine Bar is based on a wedding I attended here in October.

A small intimate wedding dinner/celebration for around 100 guests. Tappo staff was just so wonderful the whole evening providing all the guests with excellent service. 

I was a little skeptical when I found out the dinner was not set up as a fixed menu but with choices for App and Main for each individual guest. But ended up the service was fast and food was excellent. My steak was cooked perfectly Medium Rare and so was my tablemate that requested to have his Medium Well.

The after dinner party was held inside the main dining area and the dinner was held underneath a tent in their patio area worked like a charm.

And the drinks at the bar was well prepared much better than other drinks I had at wedding in a banquet hall.

Definitely recommend if you want to set up a private event at Tappo. You and your guests will have so much fun!"}
{"text":"Went to Tappo last night with my husband, his dad and girlfriend for a nice evening out. Started off great - we were seated quickly, received warm reception from the waiter and all the staff. Until my father-in-law pulled out a Groupon and then it all went downhill. From then on, we were looked at as second class patrons, having to wait more than one hour for our apps, and then another 45 minutes for our entrees. We didn't get a basket of bread at our table like everyone else, we literally had to chase the waiter down to get a drink (which wasn't even part of the Groupon).  We were pretty much ignored the rest of the night. 
Other than the awful service experience, the food was fine. Nothing to write home about but not bad by any means. 
We won't be going back though and my advice to restaurants is that if you don't want to serve deal-buying patrons, don't put one up!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok a combination of my review and those of my friends that I was with.
Went here for lunch on a Sunday for the winterlicious event.
On first glance the place is quite charming - the old historical building in the distillery.
However a few things more about the decor - the place is origionally old - my friend did notice a spider coming down from the ceiling. I noticed something on top of the heater by the window - I care to not say what I think it was because Im not sure if it was what I thought it was. Regardless - they just need to clean that place up especially since it is an upper scale resto in an old building. When I came in and sat down I noticed the place had a strong smell of glade - like those glade air fresheners. Odd but thats fine. Later on I noticed why it smelt that way - If you sit near the back of the resto there is a sewage smell that I (thankfully) noticed by the end of the meal - quite strongly. As the waiter passed by a few times I actually thought it was him (sorry about thinking that) but I realized later that it was because he was passing by that the sewage smell wafted closer to the table. When I went to the bathroom I could smell it a lot. I felt like telling the owner because this can be fixable and I dont want this to ruin an otherwise great resto with good food. (hopefully they will read this review anyhow).

So yes - it seems that due to to the old building issues, this made for a less pleasant visit.

now on to the food...

wonderful!
:)
I had the salmon with plum chutney with spinach. The portion seemed a bit on the small side but since I had the hearty appetizer of stewed peppers with peperonata - It was filling. Just right.
The salmon was cooked well and yet tender and juicy and the plumb chutney flavor went well with the salmon. The spinach was good as well, especially since Im on a low carb diet - it was good not to have too much starch or carb paired with this meal.
I tried the proscuitto sandwich my friend had and it was good (Im not a big proscuitto fan but this was good and tender)
I also tried the penne pasta with bacon tomato cream sauce - (I loooove pasta!) - anything with bacon taste great! Actually they cooked the penne perfectly - al dente. Im not a big connesseuir of pasta but Ive had my share and have still been looking for the best since my first trip to Italy. So I can say it was good. 
The creme caramel custard was like a flan. Nice and light and refreshing with the right amount  of sweetness. The Tiramasu was good and creamy. Tiramasu is not my specialty but this one could have done with more of the cake part. 


I would recommend this place to others as long as they keep up the cleanliness and sewage smell issues. That for sure is a turn off for any meal regardless of how great the meal is. 
If you do come here - sit closer to the bar near the entrance. 
It would be a nice date place as well as the decor is intimate with the old charm. 
Just please clean up the top of the heater near the window and fix the smell."}
{"text":"Fifty minutes waiting for two dishes: one penne and one spaghetti.
Both dishes are poorly done...especially the spicy Italian pork sausage one"}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, my wife and I came here with a coupon, ours being from Travelzoo. This afforded us a starter, a pasta dish and two entrees for $55. I have to say that it was well worth the money, as those dishes if ordered without the coupon would have been close to $100.

I note some reviewers commenting on poor service and a long wait time. Our experience could not have been more opposite. Our waiter was friendly and very attentive. And the coupon deal seems to be a common experience because he knew exactly how it worked, and there were also a number of other couples out the same time as us using one.

The food is wonderful. Portion sizes aren't huge, but they are more than adequate. You go to a restaurant like this to enjoy the flavours and quality of the food, not to stuff your face on average fare.

Our starter was buffalo mozzarella and tomato with crustini. All were delicious, and accompanied with baskets of freshly baked bread. I personally loved the balsamic vinegar and olive oil we were given to dip into.

For our pasta dish we shared a spinach-ricotta gnocchi.  It was melt-in-the-mouth delicious. Possibly the nicest I've ever had. Certainly worth trying if you're ever hear on a similar coupon deal.

I had roasted chicken served with butternut squash and a gooseberry reduction. The chicken was so flavoursome, and the squash cooked to absolute perfection. It has the perfect balance of crunch and softness that I love in vegetables like this. My wife had the veal, which too was very tender served in a rich, creamy gravy.

As part of the coupon they ask you to tip on what the meal would have cost at full value, and not the coupon price. Which is certainly fair, and I would have been happy to have done so. However, the bill was presented in quite a convoluted manner that made it difficult to know exactly what the price would have been. And without a menu to later compare with, I didn't know what the full price would have been, and so feel like I probably undertipped our waiter. Which is a pity as he deserved a full tip based on his service and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Tappo wine bar is very nice Italian restaurant in the distillery district. The options aren't much but the items they serve are very tasty. The groupon I bought was very worth it so keep an eye out for it! The ambiance was beautiful and definitely romantic. Would recommend it to a friend who wants to romance their partner for sure ;-)"}
