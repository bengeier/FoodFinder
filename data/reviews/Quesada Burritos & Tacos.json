{"text":"I truly love the place, the decor is colourful and fun to be around and the food is amazing. I've been going there at least once every week or 2 and every bite is always delicious. The staff is extremely nice and friendly and the prices are reasonable. I would maybe accelerate the waiting time but apart from that Quesada is definitely the place to go for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Great burritos, friendly staff, good price; by far my favorite take-out in the area! Often staying for long periods at the Crowne Plaza, the little 10-15 minute hike to Quesada is always worth it! I always go for a large burrito (Ancho Pork or Drunken chicken are great and full of good stuff) and I make it a combo with nachos/salsa and a drink. Plenty of deliciousness for about 12$. Mucho tasty!"}
{"text":"I come from California so maybe my expectations are a bit high. However, you don't need to be a food elite to know a burnt quesadilla when you get one. The veggies were wilted and sparse. Plus, I'm not shy especially when it comes to my food and even more so when it comes to my Mexican Food. And the most important factor of any Mexican restaurant is the ambience. When I walk in anywhere I want to feel like I'm part of the family. Quesada makes you feel like the unwanted in-law. Because when you kindly remark that your food is burnt, and paltry stuffed, your snubbed by the rude woman who hates her life.  Oh and I paid $7.50. Delicious delicious carcinogens.   Quesada ... I think it should be called Qu√© Pena!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Burritos dont get a free pass. With places like Chipotle making their way into the Canadian market, this sad excuse for a mexican lunch spot is pathetic. The resto itself is a dump. If you want to use the washroom, you either grab a soup ladel, or what appears to be a dulled kitchen knife, with a key a washroom attached. It just isnt a pleasant environment. Rather rude service I would say, zero smiles or any sort of patronizing. It might as well have been a rude robot making my mediocre burrito. On a plus, I do mean mediocre literally, the burrito isn't bad at all, its just not anything special, which was what i was looking for. The ingredients looked fresh enough, it just looked unprofessional, having your rice served out of a cruddy looking crock pot, and a chipped plastic container with a handful of dried pathetic cillantro. Alright prices would possibly vault this rating to a 2.5, but i would recommend taking your business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Amazing place. My friend brought me here for lunch and I had probably one of the best burritos yet. Bigger and about the same price as you typical burrito place. I liked their selected varieties of sauces, the habanero mayo was delicious. Definitely going to eat here again."}
{"text":"I think I have been spoiled in that I have eaten in some amazing Mexican food eateries, so I had little to no expectations for Quesada. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed that it looks like Mucho Burrito or Baja Fresh (in the States). A quick look over the menu board, I settled on a large burrito with grilled chicken filling. Choices are numerous, but not overwhelming in terms of combinations as some places can be. Unfortunately, there was no beef/steak offering as they were out - how this happens, I have no idea but it clearly disappointed a couple of guys in line ahead of me.  The counter service was quick and friendly. Burrito was assembled with toppings as I requested from a good selection. There are a variety of sauces and salsas to choose from as well. Once wrapped, there is the option to have your selection toasted. I opted for that and took my order to go - I was in and out of Quesada, burrito in hand in about 15 minutes.   The seating area, it should be noted, is bright and has a decent number of chairs and tables.  So what about the burrito? Was it any good? I arrived at my home, a short drive away, and chowed down. Rice and chicken paired with a medium salsa was nice. I skipped the beans and guacamole, but added lettuce, tomato, and some cheese which tasted fresh. The large size is about all I needed, so I am glad I did not go one size up.  Give it a try. It may not be my favourite place, but I definitely will go again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location numerous times, as it's close to work. The owner, who is almost always there, is very friendly and accommodating. Choices of meats and toppings is standard fare but always very fresh and tasty. Neat and clean, lots of parking, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Employees smoking in front of the store while on their shift. Employees dont listen when they put your toppings. And fountain drinks are very very watery. I used to love this place but service is just terrible."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's very close to chipotle or free birds and since they don't have any herd in Calgary, it's really good. The staff is very friendly and quick service all the time!"}
{"text":"Five months and a bit I was curious to see if this new Mexican eatery had upped its game. Sadly no.  The quesadilla, steak, all dressed without lettuce as it would make the quesadilla too soggy, I was told. The counter person a very nice young lady toasted it to perfection. At the table I tried lifting one of the pieces barley making any of it to my anxious tongue. From the counter to my seat it had gone soggy even without the damned lettuce. So with plastic cutlery now in hand and grumpy in charge I ate to stuffed this self deconstructing, moderately flavourful quesadilla.  Like I've said many times, if you're going to do food do it right or not at all. You otherwise embarrass yourself, make a mockery of it origines, disrespect the ethnicity of the people and insult the pallet of those who have refined taste buds and knowledge of various cultures. Oh yes and You embarrass Yourself!  On the bright side quesadillas were half price. $4,54 tax in and I was not hungry afterward, just wanting real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ok so I come to Starbucks, say to myself I'm starving maybe ill get a burrito from quesada. Go on yelp check out the reviews, some good stuff, so yeah ill try it.   Y did I waste my money..... Mexican my butt... When did plain white rice with no flavour become Mexican???   The staff was nice when they greeted me at the counter. I got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken, oh wow the chicken sadly did not have any flavour, it was just hot.. Big Disappointment Along with my plain white rice and hot tasteless chicken I got bean that overpowered my burrito, a lil and I mean lil cheese that I couldn't even taste.. They were even cheap with the lettuce. Overall I wished I stayed hungry and kept my $6.10"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I waited in line for more than 10 minutes and when I saw the girl microwave some sort of meat I decided to tell her I didn't want it anymore.  She proceeded to say and I quote \"good\"   Never coming back"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  All the ingredients that they have taste good but you put them together in a quesadilla and they turn in to a sloppy mess.  For over $11 with a drink I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good, wholesome, quality food prepared right before your eyes using fresh ingredients. Great for diners who like to customize their meals! Friendly staff who care about the food and maintain good food hygiene approaches (new gloves for each customer). I'll be going back."}
{"text":"It is great for takeout. Very tasty burritos. Good size. Would recommend. The only problem is that there is not much parking spots in front. But there are plenty in the plaza with other food establishments. So every day you can choose something else."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito places in Toronto. This is the original Quesada location and the service and staff are impeccable. I highly recommend the fish burrito."}
{"text":"Just ate one of their tortilla salads - weak.  The flavor and overall quality of the salad was decent, but for almost $10 I didn't get much salad.  Definitely not a meal salad, and definitely not worth $10."}
{"text":"it is passable and convenient but not the best burrito you'll ever have. You're so close to great burritos at bandidos (or boyz)."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The interior is nice but food quality is nowhere near similar places like mucho burrito. No free chips and I did not see guacamole offered.  The burritos taste like a quesadilla from taco bell with rice and beans added. The price is a bit lower (2 burritos for $10 on Saturday and Sunday) than chiptole but the quality tradeoff is not worth it."}
{"text":"Visited Quesada for the 2nd time, and, although a bit of the novelty had worn off, it was still pretty good!  I wasn't sold on the whole \"burrito craze\" in the beginning, but, over the past few months, I've started to enjoy them. My favourite is the chicken with whole wheat burrito.  Price point - $10 for a bottle of water and a large chicken Burrito. (A little pricey, but, typical for the area.)  When you see my 2-star rating, I know you're thinking...\"why should I go\"? To be honest, it's a nice spot to go for a quick lunch as the food is fresh/ tasty, and there is ample seating (inside AND outside). **There are two BIG factors that have resulted in my poor rating:  1) They charge extra for Guacamole. I know it's expensive...but, it's a little unnerving having to pay extra for it (especially when you're getting a freaking burrito!!!).  2) The older woman (who reminds me of Cruella Deville) at the cash always seems to be cranky, and could use a Manners101 course. If you can't deal with people, get out of the food business!  In short, good food & nice location, but, the service can be brutal!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience yet.   I usually get the medium sized pork burrito. very filling and full of flavour.   One should note that the spicy chicken is VERY spicy!!! and there is no warning from the staff...  not for amateurs especially paired with the hot salsa.   All in all I would say comparable to Mucho (maybe a bit cheaper) and better than Chipotle pork burrito"}
{"text":"Poor service and less bang for your buck - wouldn't swap a taco instead of a burrito worth the same price to take part of the Blujays beer promotion. Was forced to take a coors light because the Canadian was warm outside of the fridge. Wouldn't offer corona or Stella for exchange. Burrito was totally burnt on one side. Taste was bland, guacamole costs extra, chip salsa taste like watery baby tomato juice. For a cheaper price and better taste try Burrito boyz on Adelaide."}
{"text":"Tried the fish taco, great flavors Pico was spicy  everything tasted great and is a great place for a bite."}
{"text":"I should start by admitting that I don't like burritos. Sadly, this makes me a poor candidate for most of Toronto's Mexican offerings, which seem to center around great big overstuffed burritos. What I love about Quesada is that they offer tacos! Soft or hard shells with beef, chicken, spicy chicken or pork and your choice of toppings. They're fresh, filling, and a mere $6.99 for THREE -- making them a great lunch choice.  Service is friendly and efficient; line-ups at lunch can sometimes be long."}
{"text":"I love this place, quick easy healthy in most cases the regular burrito I get is under 10$. The staff is delightful professional, all smiles. I get the grilled chicken, no rice, both beans with avocado, corn, cilantro, lettuce and cheese. There is 3 grills, I always get mine grilled a little longer, with the beans could get potentially messy."}
{"text":"Burrito basics. Visiting Toronto needed something quick and to go. Spicy chicken, whole wheat burrito. Tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"I am giving this place four stars because you get exactly what you pay for and they did it well within the expectation I had on them. I expected a low rent version of Chipotle and I got it. They were quick, accommodating, pleasant to deal with and a family of five got dinner for $30. That is what I wanted and they provided it. And as someone who eats A LOT of tex mex, this wasn't offensive. I have had worse and I have had better. But for the price point, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick burrito, even when they are busy. Lots of choices for ingredients and large portions. Sometimes I find the hot sauce too hot for me, usually stick with the mild or medium. Good value for your money and lots of parking."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their Lime Fish Tacos! Good place, fresh veg, fast service, good value!"}
{"text":"ordered a burrito 12 inch for $9.19 tax included and I specified that I have medical conditions not to put hot sauce I wanted mild sauce. I ordered to go when I got home to eat it the sauce was extra hot barely can even take the first bite. It went in the garbage.  Very disappointed  and that's an understatement. I've been eating burritos all over this continent for the past 15 years and I rate this for the price very poor in quality and very soggy."}
{"text":"I have only ever had the spicy chipotle chicken burritos here, so that's all my review is about.  To be honest, nothing will compare to the burritos I've had when visiting California, but I'll still come back here when I need a burrito.  The spicy chipotle chicken burritos are definitely spicy enough for me, and tasty enough. I've tried to order the tacos, or the \"burrito in the buff\" I've seen other people order. But when I step up to the counter, it becomes \"spicy chipotle chicken burrito, with the green salsa\".  Service is efficient."}
{"text":"If I were the owner I would change a few things. First, I would move the garbage cans away from the entrance so people trying to throw away the garbage that is the food here don't block the poor people trying to get in.   Second, I would stop using Groupon to get people to come in because clearly each transaction takes 10 minutes longer than it should.   Third, I would stop feeding my customers the bottom of the nacho barrel, the tiny little crumbs that no one enjoys, only to cover it up with the normal-sized nachos right in front of my customers.  Fourth, I would stop buying my ingredients from the discount aisle of whatever hellish grocery store they came from. If I wanted lettuce and tomatoes that tasted like nothing I'd buy a burger at Mcdonalds. Hmm, maybe I did buy a burger at McDonalds and it was just re-arranged to look like a burrito. I just don't know anymore."}
{"text":"It's convenient but it's not great.  positive: speedy, better than other fast food options when you're in the area negative: food is only so-so, extra charge for guacamole  I had the cilantro lime shrimp burrito. The shrimp, while nicely sized, didn't really taste like either cilantro or lime. The whole thing became a bit of a soggy mess at the bottom, particularly when I was fighting to peel the grilled tortilla from the aluminium foil...  I really liked tamarind variety of Jarritos (Mexican pop) in the cooler!"}
{"text":"Best fucking burrito place around. It's so fucking good, fuck, I cant even right now.  #extraCHEESE!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place after a recommendation.   So glad we did.  We have started to make it our regular lunch destination."}
{"text":"I came in early afternoon on September 16th ( Sunday). I ordered the chicken chipotle quesadilla and the oven roasted chicken burrito. First of all, the chicken from both meals are probably within the same age: 2 days old? That's my estimation. Disgusting and old and flavorless. Why is the burrito soggy? It's fricken grilled!!!  Just bland spicy food that came out to 20 bucks with 2 drinks. Not worth it. On top of that, the guy serving us was by himself and he started to text in front of his friend who was sitting at a table and chat really loudly with each other. I overheard his friend ask if anything was fresh or made today and he said some of the things are, but most of them need to be prepared in advance because it would be difficult if it wasn't. Difficult??? Yuck! Never coming back here!"}
{"text":"Not as good as Chipotle but definitely better than Taco Bell -which is setting the bar pretty low-.  Think of the food exactly as making the sandwiches at home with minimal effort put into the meats and ingredients. No obvious marination or spicing.  Tried the Steak, Spicy chicken and Fish Burrito, Tacos and quesadilla.  The Burrito is surprisingly good. The actual proteins are nothing special but the added fresh ingredients and Sauce make all the difference. I usually ask them to drain the beans and Avoid adding too many ingredients in order not to make it soggy or dilute the taste given the blandness of the meats.   Their soft/hard Tacos were good but their spicy chicken doesn't go well with the Tacos.  The Quesadilla would be my favorite and I would listen to the server regarding what not to add or it would be a mess -e.g. lettuce in a Quesadilla-. One thing I didn't like about it is the fact that they don't leave it on the sandwich grill long enough so the bread doesn't actually fuse a bit but I just prefer it that way.  The chips/Salsas were pretty plain. Supermarket quality.  Service was good but -understandably- hurried when busy or late in the day.   I think this place shines in regards to it's fresh ingredients and some good Sauces. However, if they stay as they are when Chipotle opens, they will have a hard time keeping up."}
{"text":"Since there isn't a Burrito Boyz near school I decided to give this place a try. Welp, It's sure no Burrito Boyz. I ordered a spicy chicken chipotle burrito and for some reason was still asked what kind of meat I wanted... ummm chicken; duh. They use a lime/cilantro rice that just has a weird sour taste and the only sauce choices are flavoured mayonnaise. I got the chipotle mayo which wasn't awful but not what I want in a burrito. The burrito itself was really just bland. The kicker though is that THEY CHARGE EXTRA FOR CHEESE!! How is that not included? cheese is half the point of a burrito (unless you're vegan/lactose intolerant of course :) ) Even so the price wasn't crazy, even with the 75cent cheese charge it was 7.00$ which is average. The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. They need to either up the quality or lower the price if they're going to compete with all the other Mexican spots. I won't bother going back."}
{"text":"Burrito tr√®s bon prix assez chere mais la qualit√© et la quantit√© est la je le recommande"}
{"text":"Pretty average burritos here.  Not unpleasant to eat, just not anything to get excited about.  I've eaten at this one, and another location (food court I think) and they were both acceptable options.  Now, when you consider the proximity to other available burritos, there isn't much need to stop here, unless overwhelmed by the convenience factor for those in the immediate area, and you can't suffer the walk down to Lower Sherbourne.  Or unless you absolutely must wash your burrito down with a Dos Equis at this licensed establishment."}
{"text":"Saw this place on my way home one afternoon and I'm hooked on it!! Great fresh food and friendly staff! I had the fish tacos the other day.. Damn!!! Those are good!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: there are a lot of burrito joints within walking distance of this place that are way better. This place would be near the bottom of my list.  I got a large steak burrito with guacamole.   It was definitely filling but the taste just wasn't there. The burrito was bland and halfway through I wanted to toss the rest in the garbage.  With a bottle of Coke the meal came to about $11.50.  One and done."}
{"text":"Grabbed a steak burrito for lunch which provided decent value. Lots of choices for toppings; rice, corn, cilantro, black beans, salsa, cheese. Overall, good bang for the buck and quick when you're pressed for time"}
{"text":"Ventilation is terrible in here. The drop ceiling is starting to buckle and it's like a steamy Chili pepper sauna inside. You'll leave smelling like food. Had the steak tacos for dinner right before closing and my stomach has been tender for two days. Steak was like cubed rubber and the taco shells weren't heated and stale. Topings and hot sauce were tasty and the staff was friendly.   For close to the price of eating in a restaurant the value isnt here for fast food. There are better other Can-mex fast food options in this price range that offer a better meal (Tacos Del Mar, Tacos Al Asador, Burrito Boyz/Burrito Banditios etc)   I wouldnt eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy chicken burrito . It was good and worth the money. I would be careful though when ordering. If you say you want all vegetables, watch the guy making it because he will add guacamole on it and not tell you it's an extra charge of .75 cents.   When you go to pay for it,  the cashier already guesses that there is guacamole on it.   Everyone in line was having guac but I never heard anyone ask for it."}
{"text":"Excellent burrito. Had the flame grilled chicken. Couldn't devour it fast enough. Loved the black beans and the green salsa (verde). Top notch guac, too. The whole thing was super flavourful and not heavy like others I've had elsewhere."}
{"text":"You know what?  I order the bean and cheese. No cheese. No rice. 2 salsas plus the fresh pico, lettuce and cilantro. So what we have here, basically, is a bean and lettuce burrito. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS ENTICING TO YOU.  But like I said, you know what? I like it a lot.   Sometimes I'll get it 3 days a week for lunch. I'll assassinate it with limey hot sauce and by the time I get half way through, it's dripping a lake into my burrito basket. But I don't care. I like the steamy tortilla and the bean party in my mouth. So, here's a big fat Kanye shrug for ya.   Plus: I also love the 3 minute walk from work, and the 5 dollar price tag!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the food is disgusting. When asked for steak burrito, the server opened the steak container which was completed dried and burned, it was the leftovers what she was serving. It seems the server could care less what we (the clients) think of the place. Dont waste your money!!!!!! Im warning you!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst....not worth a penny. Me and my friend wanted to try Mexican style food and we stepped into this place on a cold day. The  food looks like at has been prepared week ago. The service was ok. The baskets the food is served looks like not washed for months. The chips looked like came from Doritos packet, salsa did not even look like salsa, forget the taste. The buritos were not even warm even after going through a grill. This place never getting my business ever again!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite lunch places .... good quality burritos without the wait !!"}
{"text":"Was in the area for work and was tired of the usual Harveys, Swiss Chalet, Cara dominated restaurants in the area.  So we tried Quesada.    I had the chicken burrito in a whole wheat wrap with rice and beans, and the usual toppings.  It tasted fresh, a small burrito was quite substantial, it filled my tummy and I didn't feel groggy afterwards.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I come to this place 2-3 times a week. I always get their spicy chicken burritos. The burritos are indeed much cheaper than Chipotle and I like this better than Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"I eat here often and bring visitors from out of town all the time. This place has great burritos and sauces. They opened about 8 years ago, a go to place for many of us in the area."}
{"text":"For anyone who is passing by and wants a quick fill of  burrito in their tummy, this is the place.  For anyone who is looking for a tasty burrito, keep looking.    I would not say it's the best nor it's the worst. It can do better. I tried the first on their burrito menu: Oven-Roasted Chicken.  I was looking forward to the usual ingredients that I like to have in a burrito. My first disappointment was the lack of guacamole, the usual ingredient included in ordering a burrito(in many places I have tried).  Realized that I had to pay extra made me feel that I was denied of the authenticity of their 'mexican' style burrito. The ingredients I requested weren't as tasty as they had described on the web.  For example:  1.Cilantro-lime Rice  Lacked the cilantro and/or the lime. Quesada could use a bit more of these ingredients to make the burrito more flavourful.   2. Mild Sauce I found it a tad watery which made it milder than usual.   3. Black and Pinto Beans(both picked) A bean is a bean. It can be softer.  4. Oven-roasted Chicken Could have added a few more, 4 more pieces of 1/4\" diced chicken. I couldn't really taste their 'own adobo spices.'   The rest of the ingredients added: salsa, lettuce, cheese.    Combined, it lacked the typical piquant burrito taste.  As described in their web ad, the menu is simple.  'Complex Flavour,' it's not.    For a total price of a small burrito: $6.05 including tax.  FYI: The small burrito is smaller(even when I asked to add all choices of ingredients in, except for some chillies) than the small size at Burrito Boyz. I can never finish a small burrito every time I buy one at Burrito Boyz. In Quesada, I was surprised that I ate it effortlessly.  The prices are about the same."}
{"text":"Worst excuse of a burrito shop I've experienced. I've tried dozens of burrito chains in Canada and the states and this is the worst to date, highly recommend to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The nacho chips were fresh.  They are a little stingy with the cheese & bean toppings for the nachos"}
{"text":"Not a fan of their Burritos, and they have decent tacos.   I came here to say the only thing worth getting on the menu is the Salad, fresh, delicious, served with Guacamole in a tortilla bowl! Absolutely worth it. Everything else is mediocre.    GO For The Salad!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by to grab a large drunken chicken burrito. This was my first visit to this location but I've been to Quesada on King St. before (although it had been a while since my last visit).  The staff seemed to be a newbie. He was pretty slow, which was totally fine with me since I wasn't in hurry. BUT he started scooping rice without asking me if I wanted it at all (I usually go for beans, no rice). Good that I caught him before he dumped the scoop of rice on the tortilla. Next, the meat portion was really skimpy. I have had their regular-sized (the smallest) burritos before and it was still that same one small scoop (not even full scoop) on the larger tortilla. (I felt like I was basically paying more for the larger tortilla, not the meat portion.) Then, when he was putting on the toppings, it was basically just \"sprinkling\". I had to ask to put more of certain toppings because he literally added one teaspoon (not tablespoon) amount of each topping.  Overall it tasted okay, but I certainly would have ordered regular sized, had I known the amount of meat and toppings for larger burritos are the same as regular sized burritos."}
{"text":"rude management and by far the worst mexican food ive ever tasted. absolutely flavourless. could barely tell the difference between the beef and the chicken. i would never eat there again and if i were mexican i would be offended that this place calls themselves mexican. i didn't even taste a hint of spice. not even black pepper! waste of money"}
{"text":"Great option for lunch in the financial district.  In the world of burritos, quesada has some healthier options. I often get the small spicy chicken salad which is essentially a spicy chicken burrito on lettuce (I add black bean, jalpeno, tomato, cliantro, sour cream and spicy salsa). If you want to go even healthier you can have grilled veggies on your salad, or grilled chicken.  If you want to be slightly less healthy, you can add a small bowl of chips/salsa and a pop for about $2.00 to any burrito/salad.  Always a line over the lunch hour but it moves quickly.   How does it compare to the other burrito joints?  -Cheaper than Chipotle -smaller portions than Freshwest Grille and burrito boys -shorter wait than Burrito boys -'lighter' options available -licensed! -stamp card for burrito lovers (frequent customers)"}
{"text":"I'd ordered food through the skip the dishes here before, the first time they forgot to put my sauce on, the second time they didn't put my sauce on the side. I figured maybe it was a miscommunication with the ordering so I decided to come in and get food. I came in and ordered my meal and all was fine until I went to pay, I handed the worker my money and was promptly told they couldn't open the till to take my cash. They hadn't told me before they made my meal, there was no sign anywhere. Luckily I had brought my debit card with me. Very unprofessional that they didn't tell me in advance.. as cash is a valid form of payment they shouldn't just assume you won't pay with it. Gave it 2 stars because in the end the food was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible for a burrito place. Nor up to par with competitors. Burrito was very small, little toppings, and minute made rice. The side chips were very bland and no flavour. The salsa was watered down, and then drink was too small. Overall a complete waste of $11. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was very hungry and walking by and noticed that they have a grand opening and were giving away FREE burritos. Well obviously i had to stop and the line wasn't very long (20-25 mins in total). They made the burrito quite quickly and due to the long line, the toritilla wasn't toasted properly. I chose the roasted veggies regular burrito($4.99) and I have to say it was really good!  It's quite thick and they were generous. Their spicy isn't really that spicy so go for the hottest one if you're into that. The staff was also very kind and even provided chips with salsa to us while we waited in line. Really nice and clean place, check it out if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"The customer service was fantastic, the gentleman that served me paid a lot of attention to detail. The setting is great as well, the tables were very clean and overall I was very impressed by the location/setting.  My problem was with the chicken. I ordered the spicy chicken and was not made aware that it was brown meat of the chicken which I really don't like. I wish I had asked earlier because it did not taste good at all. When I was leaving the gentleman asked me if everything was ok and I said I didn't like the chicken. He told me that next time I should order non-spicy chicken as it's a 80%:20% ratio of white meat to brown meat. I think Quesada should make it more clear what type of meat they are serving.   Probably would not return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their service and the cleanliness. The spicy chicken and their special sauce are amazing."}
{"text":"I had the small chicken burrito with tomatos, cheese, lettuce, corn, rice, cilantro, mild salsa sauce and black beans.  A bit messy eating near the end but it's fast food, healthy (I think) and fills my tummy!  Service was okay on a weeknight after 5pm."}
{"text":"the most amazing food, filling cheap, healthy, can't ask for anything better Staff is so friendly, amazing"}
{"text":"The setup:  Quesada claims to serve up Toronto's best burrito.  Once again, I've learned the hard way that anyone who claims to be the best probably isn't.  I'm not saying my burrito wasn't good.  I'm simply suggesting that claiming to be \"Toronto's Best\" anything is an audacious position to stake out, and you best be bringing your A-game to back it up.  Quesada has about five locations; this one just opened up in my neighbourhood and I stopped by to find out if it would be a suitable alternative to McDonald's when I'm in a pinch for a bite.  I'll go back when I need a quick meal on the go - my burrito was fast, fresh and tasty, and held together beautifully.  Construction (the making of the burrito):  I ordered pork (chicken, spicy chicken, steak and veggie are also options) and was surprised to find it cubed instead of pulled.  Black beans, rice, corn, tomatoes and jalapenos were visibly fresh.  A swath of guacamole was applied for a 65-cent upcharge; sour cream and shredded cheese were free.  A bit of a letdown to realize I was given a whole-wheat tortilla.  And the finishing touch - lightly grilled for a lightly browned shell and enhanced structural integrity.  The large is a pretty good size - it weighs in smaller than Big Fat Burrito or Burrito Boyz, but maybe that's a good thing.  Deconstruction (the eating of the burrito):  My overall impression was that this was a decent fast-food burrito.  Nothing exceptional.  But criticism is way easier to write than praise, so allow me to indulge a bit...  The first thing I noticed was the whole-wheatiness of the shell.  I hadn'tpaid attention to this while my burrito was bing put together, but I wasn't offered a choice which leaves me believing I had none.  I get that some of us want to eat healthy, but I think there's room for options here.  The flavours in the burrito were struggling to mix.  Every bite was different, and every bite was good, but it just seemed to be all over the map.  All of my cilantro was at the start, the cheese was in the middle, and the beans,  a bit firm for my preference, at tne end.  The cubic nature of the pork didn't help; it sat in discrete lumps throughout instead of integratging seamlessly with the rice and beans as it would have done in the pulled format.  I ate the burrito at home, over a plate, and was astounded at the way it held together. While I noticed a crack forming near the top of the burrito, once I ate past that point I was in the clear.  By the time I was done, one single, solitary grain of rice had escaped certain doom, leaping to the plate below.  Impressive.  Three stars.  Barely."}
{"text":"I have a slight obsession with Quesada bowls. Like, I go here about 3-4 of my 5 day work week. Its MUCH cheaper than chipotle and I get way more. My only gripe would be to have a better hot sauce and salsa bar. There isn't enough heat difference between them nor a whole lot of flavour and for someone that has taste buds that were developed outside of Canada, I would really appreciate more attention here. The owner lady (i think...) that rings you up is insanely friendly.    /knucks"}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick, inexpensive and tasty lunch. I will stop back on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, not the best but I am giving it 2 stars because I found a hair in my food. I decided not to complain because their food is not that great to begin with. The men do not wear hair nets just cuz they have short hair bug it was a nasty short hair that I found. Anyway all in all I am not happy with this place and advise people to check food carefully. Service was just ok not great but not the worst either."}
{"text":"Great prices for the quantity of food, customer service good, quality of food good, cleanliness could use a tad of a polish.  I had lunch with m'lady at this venue a few days ago. I had a burrito, and she has a taco and nachos. The quality of the food was quite decent, however the baskets at the garbage can as well as the contents of the garbage can were piling up. The tables also weren't getting wiped, and chairs at the table nearest the cash register area were all over the place.  All-in-all, which the exception of the cleanliness and slight messiness situatin I don't see anything that could've been improved at this venue. If in the area, I'd be more than happy to return there."}
{"text":"I've been back here several times and although I do enjoy it, there are a few things that I would change. I find the meat selection to be decent enough but the chicken seems under seasoned for my taste. The salsas are actually quite good but I wish I could get a little more when getting it with combo w/chips. Aside from that, they keep me coming back. Much better then Mucho Burrito IMO."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible, especially comparing to other burrito places like Burito Boyz or Fat Bastard burrito. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito, with lots of hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't help, and the fillings were very bland. It was definitely cheaper than the other, cost me about $7 for the regular size burrito, but tasted so bad I'd obviously much rather pay more for a good burrito! Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"The menu is quite simple and easy to navigate through. Just your basic tacos, burritos and quesadillas. I tried the three tacos option with the spicy chicken and regular grilled chicken. The hard shell corn tacos tasted sort of old and dry while the meat lacked flavour. The toppings were just average with nothing exceptional. If you're looking for a quick bite, then it's a good option but I've definitely tried a lot of better quick Mexican food options in town. My friend tried the quesadilla option and he seemed to be satisfied with it. Definitely wish the meat was more flavourful this classifying this joint as just average."}
{"text":"I was downtown for a meeting today so I thought I'd grab a quick bite here. I ordered the spicy chicken burrito with guacamole. I topped it with  salsa verde, black beans, pico de gallo, and cilantro. I was about to order the steak burrito, but the beef in the warming tray did not look like steak to me. It looked more like chopped up roast beef so I changed my mind to chicken.   The food was pretty good. I'd probably give the food a 3.5. The chicken wasn't freshly grilled like you'd get at Chorizo, but it had a nice spicy flavour. The guacamole was fairly standard and they do charge an extra 75 cents for it. That's fine with me. I think the pico de gallo had cucumber in it, which is kind of weird, and the lady preparing my burrito did offer to top my burrito with mayo (uh, no thanks), which is definitely weird. But aside from those oddities this was a fairly good burrito.  What bumped the rating up a half point was the excellent service. The lady making my burrito was super nice."}
{"text":"The food is really good - but the staff have me rolling my eyes everytime I have gone there in the past year.  I used to go here for lunch quite often when they first opened, as they were very nice and friendly.  Now, they never smile and are so cheap with the amount of food they give, whether its a burrito, or salad... and after 2+ years of coming here, I have seen the difference in time.   I tried the breakfast burrito the other day with chorizo sausage and the lady had put 7 small pieces (trust me, they were tiny) i the oven to cook, and had only put 5 of the 7 pieces in my burrito.  Ummm, ok?? Then she is complaining to ME that the customer before me was commenting on how long the breakfast takes to make there, and was defending herself in saying it is made fresh.  It did take 10 mins to make mine, as they do make the eggs fresh, but again - this is a 'fast food' establishment.   Food = yum!  Staff = 2 thumbs down"}
{"text":"The food is great, they make really tasty tacos and borritos. But I ordered 3 tacos and I only got 2. I paid for THREE tacos. Where did my other one go? So minus 2 stars for only getting me two tacos when I ordered three. And to conclude,always make sure you have THREE tacos if you order three:)"}
{"text":"Horrible place , tried the chicken burrito and ended up with food poisoning the next day , very pissed off with this joint ."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick and cheap Mexican food fix. This place is in the same vein as Mucho Burrito, but Quesada does a better fish taco."}
{"text":"Always able to get a fresh burrito here. Steak is my fav n they have good deals on jays games.. Large burrito n beer for 10$"}
{"text":"Probably not a good idea to have Chipotle 2 days ago and eat here today. I had the same type of bowls (pork) so an equal comparison.  Chipotle is a 4.5 experience. Fresh, flavourful and filling. Everything today was totally bland. And they skimp on the toppings. Lots of lettuce and rice but minimal beans, tomatoes and maybe a tablespoon of cheese and sour cream. For $8.00 plus tax I would expect better.   In the future I will stick to Anush (next door Middle Eastern) for a flavourful and filling shwarma."}
{"text":"Had the regular sized (smaller) version, on whole wheat (I WAS given the choice) grilled veggie burrito (do I use too many parentheses?).  Love the option of whole wheat (best part?  It didn't taste TOO healthy) and a smaller size.  BTW, the \"smaller size\" was still pretty danged big, and I'm just north of 200.  LOTS of good toppings, and I appreciated being able to veto the coriander leaves.   Chopped jalapenos were a nice option.  My friend had the pork burrito and also enjoyed it.  Nice new addition to the area."}
{"text":"The only good thing I have to say is they have some gluten free items and the food seems fresh.   Servers were rude and pushy.   That being said be careful if you have Celiac disease or have sensitivities. We have 3 in our family of 5 that have Celiac disease. We asked for soft corn tortillas but they are warmed in the same press as the flour tortillas. The servers both said we won't get sick as it's so hot...a lack of understanding about the disease. Now I don't expect everyone to understand, but don't argue with those who have it, they know what they're up against. We had to be insistent that it was not okay, that we would get very sick and we ended up having the hard corn tortillas.   The servings were paltry to say the least, very skimpy. They charge $0.50 for guacamole and you only get a very thin smudge (GF be wise they touch the flour tortillas and place the utensil back in so don't have guac).   Take your business and your money elsewhere, where you will get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Quesada's burritos are less greasy than some others I've tried.  There are several bean and topping options.  I was sad to see that guacamole costs extra, since it's my favourite.    When I do finally get my burrito, it's fantastic.  They fill it up pretty well and it's nice and hot when you get it.  If you have a big appetite, the 'Big Ass' burrito will definitely be satisfying.  It's impressive watching them make this thing, and I'm even more impressed when I see someone eat this giant burrito in one sitting.  Unfortunately, the service is always ridiculously slow and their hours don't seem to match my burrito cravings."}
{"text":"Been a regular here since the day it opened. It's really refreshing to have a place that serves food that is actually pretty healthy !   I'm a die hard taco fan so Im always excited to get something quick and fresh. Although this isn't an authentic taco or Mexican restaurant it's really damn good.   My go to is always the chicken tacos, but recently I've tried the bean tacos and they might be my new favourite.  Their burritos come in 3 sizes with the big ass burrito being the largest and practically impossible to finish, after choosing your meet and veggies they even give the burrito a grill which is something you don't see often at chain burrito shops. And best of all it's super affordable   The staff is always friendly even on a busy lunch rush. They always cater to any requests I've had to make and are happily smiling as you pass through.   My only complaint for this place is that I wish the regular chicken had a bit more flavour or seasoning to it.   Between the tacos burritos bowls and quesadillas you will defiantly find a reason to want to come back. Don't blame me if you start a taco addiction !"}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken burrito best burrito I have had the size was great ingredients fresh staff friendly and welcoming. For a healthy meal very much recommended."}
{"text":"If you are in this neighborhood and get a hankering for a burrito, there is the original Boyz and the nee Bandidos that offer up finer, fresher ingredients at less of the price. The experience here is very Mr Pita of burritos. Kind of generic. The only redeeming quality about the burrito was the cilantro-tinged rice. Don't get me wrong, I didn't actually enjoy the rice. It was dried out and crispy. But the cilantro (what many Canadians call corriander) was the only flavor in the burrito.  Dried out and bland."}
{"text":"Compared to other \"similar\" build your own burrito places. It wasn't great."}
{"text":"Have ate at Quesada a couple times now, and have always left happy. The burrito's are HUGE and they PACK IT UP with the good stuff (love the pickled onions by the way - you won't see those used at many other places). Warning: if you ask for spicy hot, you will get spicy hot.  The quesadilla's are also super tasty (just so you know).  I'm pretty sure I'd recommend this place over any other Mexican Fast food joint in Calgary. There is seating inside, not much, but enough :) Also, the staff here are really neighbourly and I like that!   Great addition to the downtown core! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I remember when they first opened up, it was very exciting because it was the first \"Chipotle\" type restaurant in the West Island. It's always very clean. There are very long lines at lunch but the staff is normally pretty fast. I recommend getting a burrito or burrito bowl made with white tortilla, brown rice, spicy chicken, salsa, guacamole for an extra cost lol, corn, tomato, lettuce, cheese and two sauces; cilantro lime and chipotle  that's my winning combo! Oh you can literally make it a combo by added chips and a drink, the chips are very good!"}
{"text":"The burrito is surprisingly decent both in taste and portion size. I've been here maybe 3 times and the ingredients always seem to be fresh. You can choose between white or whole wheat for the tortilla and fill it with rice, beans, lettuce, corn, salsa, onions, cheese and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. You can get chicken or pork which are the cheapest meat options or beef or fish. The $1 extra for guacamole is excessive. There are a few tables here. Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Found a hard rock in my burrito. Threw the burrito out in front of the manager because I was so grossed out. He gave me money back but it was just gross."}
{"text":"For a VERRY small family run tacoria the service was extremely fast. It definitely take out only Everything is made in house & tastes AWSOME  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I visit this location of Quesada quite frequently. At least once a week for sure since I work close by. They get 3 stars because of the crazy portion size I always get! For $7 you get a heaping amount of food in a burrito bowl. For the most part everything is super fresh and delicious! It almost feels like a healthier version of Mexican take out.   Word to the wise: Go for the grilled chicken over the spicy and just add hot sauce as you please. The spicy chicken is usually way too dry!   You can also get tacos family style for $30 if you have a lot of people with you! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great flavours. We moved here from US and love the food. I especially like the pork carnitas. Everything we has tasted fresh. I especially like how they toast the burritos after they are prepared. Finally, the service was outstanding. The staff are very accommodating to kids."}
{"text":"Ordered this from uber eats on a Wednesday for lunch   Pros: - none that I could think of  Cons - small-ish portions  - bland taste  - chicken bowl didn't have much chicken"}
{"text":"This restaurant is doing a poor job trying to compete with Mucho Burrito. Their large burrito is nowhere near the size , nor flavour of Mucho burrito's.  When you go into the restaurant, it gives me the vibe of \"cutting corners\" at everything they do. From the trays to the portions and of course the flavour -less food is downright pathetic. I will take my money to dixie/401 Mucho Burrito."}
{"text":"Went in and was the only customer in the restaurant. The clerk explained the menu and I chose the steak burrito. I asked for a small amount of rice and the clerk gladly obliged me. Had to repeat myself when choosing my toppings,  but other than that the whole process was simple. Got home to eat my burrito it had a very waxy taste to it. I assume from the wax wrap around the burrito when they toasted it. Kind of ruined my first experience, but overall the filling is quite hearty and tasty."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of burritos all together and this place is the best! When I went to gb this place was a just to go to on the reg. they have quite a few options for toppings and food items. It's a great student hub and a great grab a go spot before going to st James park. Service is super fast and always friendly. I really have only good things to say about this food spot :) I always go when in neck of the woods."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Chipotle then you'll know that Quesada is a blatant Canadian rip off. If Quesada had succeeded in the way that Chipotle had I would be a fan of this Mexican Grill. While Chipotle prides itself on being the best by using fresh ingredients and chemical free meat, Quesada strives itself on being its mediocre sibling. It's like when you see a celebrity's non-famous brother or sister, there's something slightly off and just not right. (Case and point being Jerry O'Connell's brother Charlie). Quesada, the Charlie O'Connell of the Mexican Grill World, is simply bland, flavorless food."}
{"text":"Food is very good, pricing is ok, service is quite stiff, rushed and unfriendly. Wouldn't kill them to smile once in a while"}
{"text":"It was just okay... the girl was using the same gloves preparing the food and handling money."}
{"text":"Was waiting for a Burrito place near work for a while. So when this place opened up, I was quite excited. The prices are fair, around 7$ for a regular burrito, and a few other addons may cost a buck or two more. All in all, a beef buritto with guacamole, drink and chips costed 10$. Really impressed with the quality of their food, everything looked fresh , you can smell the freshness from the onions, cilantro and jalape√±os from behind the glass. Place is clean as it should be since it has only been opened for a week. The food tasted great and fresh. Was impressed. The only thing I did not enjoy was medium salsa for the chips, first off, there's too little and second it didn't taste like anything other than lemon-y. All in all, will definitely make this one of my go-to's in this area."}
{"text":"Zero flavour except for the hot sauce. Got the large spicy chicken burrito bowl and they were super cheap with the rice and chicken portion. It was basically $9.75 for iceberg lettuce and hot sauce. It was a spicy lettuce bowl.   If you're at this intersection and just want a quick meal but don't want freshii then go a bit south to subway (sandwich, not TTC)."}
{"text":"I strolled in here with a couple of friends after getting day drunk on beer samples at a Dishcrawl. As if I didn't eat enough that day, I had to top it all off with a massive burrito at Quesada.   There were a ton of options at this place, which was great. I decided to get a spicy chicken burrito on a flour tortilla- just to continue with my unhealthy eating streak that day. For about $11 I got a heaping burrito that was filled with yummy goodness, chips, and a drink. Everything was pretty standard. Not as great as a Chipotle, but it was still pretty good nonetheless.   Service was also pretty good and fast, so I might be back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Food is good, and not really expensive... and even the guacamole you can add to the burrito is not as expensive as it is on other places. The size of the regular burrito is good enough for me, but if you're hungry, go for the large one. This place is well located, and well maintained."}
{"text":"Very good Burritos, with fresh good quality ingredients and virtually any topping and sauce you can think of. Very similar to Chipotle, however the meat is only average since I saw them heat the meat in a modern industrial oven; so they probably receive it pre-cooked and I didn't see any grill surface. That said, it's still pretty good, just not great."}
{"text":"Most of my earlier review still stands, but given that I'm here fairly regularly, they probably deserve a bit of a bump in the rating.  Based on other reviews, others have had issues with consistency; but I can just say in my 20+ visits, they've delivered perfectly fine virtually every visit.  These aren't mind-blowing burritos, but they're pretty good and I think they're better than local competition due to good quality toppings. I'm telling you: pickled onions and cabbage in lieu of lettuce is really good! Veggies are always very fresh. The meat is undoubtedly pre-cooked, and yet is has more seasoning and tastes better quality than many others, such as Burrito Boyz.  Nothing to go out of your way for, but certainly a good option when in the area or deciding between burrito places."}
{"text":"Stopped by here when traveling for business and had a delicious burrito and guac. Highly recommended for that fast casual Mexican food we all desire."}
{"text":"I feel like they read my previous comments about the service being shit now. Last two times I went there was a completely new staff!! All of them very nice and polite offer good service and smile while they are serving you.  That's exactly the kind of staff you need to keep the place running smoothly and the customers coming back. i swear last time I went it was at least 20 people in line and we all got served pretty fast. As usual the food is always good and fresh.  I tried the DDO location when the staff of this one sucked but I must say this quesada is still the best one out there in terms of how the food is prepared IMO.  Congrats on the new staff I will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"9,81$ pour un trio burrito 10\", des tortillas style chips et boisson fontaine, incluant l'extra guacamole frais qu'on aime tant :)"}
{"text":"Not bad.  The place is clean.  It's a bit of a slow night but steady.  The food is good but a bit heavy on the cilantros but enjoyable. As far as the portion goes it's fair trade."}
{"text":"So this a good little walk-up experience. Very clean with a happy helpful staff even though we walked in 10 minutes before closing. The Tacos were flavor filled and freshly prepared to order. We tried the Pork, chicken and fish with a variety of sauces and produce and weren't disappointed. Affordable, we had 6 tacos with drinks for less then $20.00. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Look at the size of that burrito. Great small place to have good burritos. Regular size is pretty big. Great choice of ingredients. Friendly staff. Our goto for burritos in Brampton area."}
{"text":"The staff here are not very welcoming, they come off as rude. They nitpick you over the most minor things, cheap out on the sauce and other dressings.  Even when asked to add more sauce or condiments, they give you attitude as they do it or make face.  The customer service is TERRIBLE. I wont go there again 4 sure because of all this even though the food is decent, not worth dealing with the staff...."}
{"text":"This Quesada has very friendly service, and food always fresh and hot.    Like most Burrito places, you have a choice of rice, beans, spices etc.  I usually have the chile lime fish burrito. Very tasty.   Decor is clean.  MT"}
{"text":"Meh! Been here 3 times times now as it's near my workplace.  It could be so much more but sadly isn't, I gave it 3 shots and now I am finished with it.  I've tried chicken, beef and the adobo seasoned pork the fillings are watery and the seasonings used lack depth. The grilling of the burrito is always rushed so your left with a soggy tepid burrito to dig into which falls apart into a watery mess leaving you to eat the remains with a fork--not very appetizing.   Guacamole is extremely overpriced for the portion.  Tortillas used are too rubbery for my preference.  Prices are average for the area."}
{"text":"Even though I come here frequently, it's not very good. Flavourless even after adding all the sauces. The burrito place at The Grange across the street is much better, but pricier. If there is a line up, expect to wait a long time. Don't go if you're in a rush and see a line!"}
{"text":"Late night bite well kind of it was 9 after a run through downtown and I was just craving something quick. It was this or st loius and I didn't really want wait and  seem awkward to go to dinner alone (I know people do it)  So I ended up here, burrito seem like a good idea and it was. I ended up get getting a spicy chicken and given I didn't really add more heat outside of a medium salsa there was some real kick to it.  Not a fan how menu says there is size bigger then the large but it doesn't exist well atleast not here.  So I got a large burrito and for 9 buck it seem like medium I have had at else where for less. So that kind of turn off.  The burrito it's was good, so but I have had better but I don't hate the food  Also topping are limited but its a fair amount and I'm not sure if this common but the burrito did stick to foil which ripped  part of it open. So that's something that need to be addressed, don't want foil in my food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick pork burrito.  The lady behind the counter was nice and friendly. The burrito was below average; bland and uninteresting.  I had the hot salsa on it and it managed to be at once quite hot but still flavourless, like it was mild grocery-store salsa with a lot of Tabasco added.  The ingredients didn't look or taste very fresh.   Several hours after eating it I suffered pretty severe digestive distress.  Aforementioned Tabasco-laced salsa made this especially unpleasant.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"How they made a burrito so bland and tasteless is a mystery to me. It was completely void of flavour. Felt like I fell for a food scam. I have no idea how this chain is still opening new stores."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and much better quality ingredients than burrito boys and fat bastard burrito. Great price and they pack it full of goodies! Line up moved quickly to boot! I have the grilled chicken burrito and it was great! Maybe if I was sharing I would opt for they \"big ass burrito\" size!!"}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers, a burrito version of Subways.  Fast food, no atmosphere, basically eat and go.  I don't recommend the trio, the tortilla chips are bleh.  I've never been offered a fidelity card and I've been there a few times now.  On the plus side the burritos are good, price is ok, the options are plentiful, and with very few burrito places in Montreal and off island, the choices are limited.  On the negative side, the service is slow, often employees are hiding in the back leaving one poor schmuck at the counter serving.  The counter itself is absolutely filthy. When I was there last night they worker literally dumped two wrapped chicken into the counter and left it there.  No napkins.The tables are never wiped, the floor is filthy. The food counter should be immaculate.  If an inspector comes in the fines are going to enormous.  It's too bad because despite all of this, there is a regular flow of customers every time I'm there and there should be no reason because there's ample employees, they just don't seem motivated or like what they're doing. I agree with Hakim O.'s review \"If the owner of the restaurant reads this, you should get new employees the ones you have now will ruin your business.\"  The fridge wasn't properly filled and out of stock of many flavors of Jarritos.  When I asked if they had any cold Pineapple Jarritos the guy behind the counter said, you already got the best flavor.  I have a feeling he would have said that no matter which one I had."}
{"text":"Came here when it first opened and was really good. Went here again while waiting for my gf to do some spa type treatment and the food was great!  Best part? It was free!  The guy was a trainee and his manager gave it to me for being so patient and it was the first one he made for a customer!  Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Alright, I have to admit, this time and last time I went, the quality wasn't to par as when it just opened.  But I'm still willing to give it another chance due to convenience, and healthier than fried chicken.   Got the completely wrong burrito today. Someone elses. It was chicken instead of pork, black beans instead of brown, cheese (instead of no cheese), corn (instead of no corn).... Not only that, it was practically soggy and falling apart in my hands. I do not think it was wrapped properly nor, grilled enough.   I'll still come back, but they really need to step up their game a little."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a burrito place in the middle of Toronto. We have a spot very similar to this called Neato-Burrito with the same setup. Nothing fantastic at this location but it'll pass for food. I felt like a little banter with the girl working the counter but she was literally no help with anything I asked because she \"doesn't eat any of the food here\" Oh, ok, don't you think that says something about your feelings towards the food in the place you work? Anyway, I got a chicken burrito with a conglomeration of various adds, it was average compared to many burritos I have eaten."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with tex-mex. Compared to the state's Chipotle or Qdoba, it is equally or just as good.   ----About the service---- Staff is very friendly and inviting. Tip them well. They work extremely hard !  ----About the food-----  No complaints here. I got the burrito bowl and everything was on point. If you're a spicy lover, their spicy sauce is actually spicy. They ask you for white or brown rice, type of beans and toppings. Total came to around $8 !   Overall, a nice joint to grab a quick, filling bite to eat and be on your way. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here by because i wanted a burrito and did not want to go mucho burrito. It was worth discovering it.  They have medium, large and \"big ass\" (yes thats what they call it) burrito sizes. I had the spicy chicken burrito, it was very good. Then I had a clintro lime fish taco, flame grilled chicken taco and nachos with spicy salsa. All n all food was good and good option for lunch or kickin in it with friends. Its right next to Service Canada so while u wait grab food. They have your usual americanized Mexican favs : burritos, tacos (soft / hard) , salads, nachos and quesadillas. Its new so they set up is good. No alcohol BTW. The only thing I would want them to do is to add some more beverages other than your usual pop n water."}
{"text":"Liked this place.  Tried it on a Wednesday at 4pm.  Guacomole is extra and expensive.  Young guy was serving us and he was very nice."}
{"text":"Interesting fast food sort of Mexican place.  The meat had some good flavors, but the construction of the tacos was a bit inconsistent and messy.  The service was also off and on the couple of times I stopped in.  For some fast take-out I'd go again, but probably micromanage them putting everything together :-)"}
{"text":"* review based on lunch only  I come to this place at least once a week, sometimes twice... Okay maybe even 3 times.  I hate waiting, that's why I like \" fast food\". The workers are fast and nice.  If a burrito with veggies, guacamole ,beans and rice is all under $7. And a McDonalds meal is $7 or more. Why would I go for the slower and unhealthier alternative?"}
{"text":"Should of probably read these reviews before eating here. Spicy Chicken burrito had no flavour chicken had old dry bits of chicken in it. Family run and they don't help each other when there is a line. Brutal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. Great food but the price is quite expensive ($9 for a burrito) and the rice could have tasted a bit better. Overall I'll come back here :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I love the people that work at this location and the food is un matched.  If you want a quick mexican bite, this is the juan place you need to go.  Get some catering done for your company as well.  So many burritos to go around."}
{"text":"This location is ALOT better than other locations I've tried very friendly and speedy service. Though I haven't tried a burrito here yet I love the fact that one of their options is called big ass burrito that takes cahones with all this pc crap these days. Also love the fact that they have tacos which is what I always get from here since I don't want Taco Bell eww and always wondered why burrito boys doesn't have tacos(which is my usual burrito place) I love the taco options I can get hard shell soft shell chicken, steak, fish, or an assortment whatever I want. I have a location right by me Kennedy and steeles, but it's just not the same seems like a downgraded version. I don't know maybe it's the people or the friendly attitude but this location just feels more welcoming so I don't mind making the drive. A warning though if you do get hard shell tacos don't wait more than ten or fifteen minutes to eat it as the middle of the shell starts to get soggy and fall apart. For a fast food place this location is definitely a win which is more than what I can say for other locations of this franchise."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times not the best but not bad and close by and convenient. Food is pretty tasty well the taco's are that's what I usually get never tried a burrito here. The other review that said there was a rock in his food makes me wonder if I should try my luck again there, but my previous good experiences make me want to try again. Used to be some decent looking girls working here which is definitely incentive to come here, but lately all I see is dudes which makes me not really want to go here as much. I'd much rather got to a burrito place with something decent to look at while being served rather than a couple of dudes. They need to bring back the fine assted bitches if they want my continued business."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, I just ate rubber steak.  The burrito itself was extra chewy. Seems like cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"Bought their Flame-Grilled Chicken on a whole wheat burrito. Wasn't as good as last time with the Big Ass Spicy Chicken Burrito. Paprika Mayo wasn't spicy enough. They barely put any rice. The wrap didn't close properly, so had to use a fork to eat it. Chicken tasted like chicken, nothing special. Service was soso. The guy keep asking me the same question. Didn't seem to pay attention to what I order."}
{"text":"Fresh , friendly and pretty damn tasty ... I ordered 3 tacos with each one containing a different meat , all were delicious especially the pork , with a bottle of ice tea it came to only 13 bucks , I'm just sorry I found this place on my last night in Toronto"}
{"text":"I had the pork and it was pretty good. They killed me with the jalape√±o seeds.    My friend had the steak, I tried it after he said it wasn't good.  Not good was an understatement.  I told him to take it back and get something else, but lunch hour is always a rush.  It was just decided we won't return.    Stick to the pork is the recommendation I guess?"}
{"text":"I went to Quesada with some friends to try it out. The place is very nice and the staff seems rather nice and attentive. The food is very spicy so I warn those that take the spicy sauces and meat.  Overall, I'm definitely going back to Quesada. The food was great!"}
{"text":"Not bad, like a cheaper version of Chipotle. Got the spicy chicken quesadilla... the tortilla bread is too large and the veggies make it a little soggy so it's messy and difficult to eat.   Because of this, I would consider getting the burrito or the burrito bowl next time. Flavours are good, portion is great and price is decent. Ideal if you just wanted something quick and tasty for lunch."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Really liked all the qualities of the meal I had. Though... I would say that the tacos and burritos have way too much cilantro. Too much. Overtook the flavour of everything in them.   The place also gets severely crowded so at times you might wait a while to even order. The place also doesn't seem to have enough space, so it gets kind of stuffy.   Also they really mean 'spicy' when they say spicy tacos/burritos.   Overall i would have to say this was a decent meal. Not great, but not too bad either."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a fast food Mexican place. But don't get me wrong, it's not the real deal. But it's ok for a quick bite."}
{"text":"First of all, let's start with the music in this joint. It's a complete throw-back to the 80s and I love it! I walked-in today and they were playing the Simple Minds's song Don't You and I totally expected the Breakfast Club to be sitting in the corner. Unfortunately, all I got was a blotted Molly Ringwald look-alike or maybe it was Molly. Who knows? The food is moderately priced for a Mexican fast food place and the location has all the appeal of better version of Tijuana. The people are nice, the food isn't sloppy and the portions are well sized."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, this is a take out place only. There is no where to seat and eat. While the food is not bad and the service is relatively quick it is not really authentic Mexican it's more fast food.  The food is not bad when compared to fast food, as it has a Mexican taste but it's not authentic Mexican food to me. A burrito is simple to make and it can be done quick; the way they do it here. As such the service is quick mush like watching a sandwich being made and there is a small selection of Mexican soft drinks, the tamarin is my favourite.   While not my first selection for food, it's great for when your in a hurry."}
{"text":"I saw in a Toronto Star article that Quesada's burritos were a lot healthier than my personal favourites, Burrito Boyz and Chipotle. I've never had Quesada. So I checked it out.   The restaurant is located next to a Canadian Tire on Dixie and Eglinton. Its space is small, tidy, and clean.   They have three sizes for their burritos - regular, large, and \"big-ass\". Yup. They also have the standard protein selections - chicken, spicy chicken, steak, and chilli lime fish (ooh, intriguing). They also have an option for grilled vegetables. I had the regular-sized steak.   You can customize your burrito with all the typical fillings. What I was particularly impressed about was the amount of the sauce options they had. They had a cilantro lime sauce that was great for dipping. You can ask for as many sauces on the side as you want.  The burrito itself was good. The fillings tasted fresh, and the sauces and salsas were delicious. Unfortunately, the steak was quite dry and tough, and definitely had been sitting there for a long time (at least warm it up if it's gonna be there all day!).   I won't avoid it if I'm in the area in the future, but I also won't be rushing to come back. While the other fillings were good, the main draw (the steak), was just average. Maybe I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Yet another burrito/taco franchise conveniently located just outside my condo.  Their chicken tacos are pretty good and I like that they offer their burritos in either small or large sizes.  The large is WAY too big for me, so I usually have the small and it's more than enough food for this little gal.  The first time I hit this joint was in the late fall and they had a delicious black bean soup, which they don't offer in the summer - makes sense.    Their prices are reasonable and they usually have a daily special, which is well worth the $5-6 price tag.  For like a $1.50 extra they'll add a soft drink and tortilla chips to your order .  The place is also licensed so you also have the option of enjoying your meal on their sidewalk patio with an icy cold Corona (that alone is worth a star)."}
{"text":"Same layout as Chipotle - pick between burrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla, etc. Choose your protein, rice, beans, veggies, and salsa/sauces.   I went for the burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, and grilled vegetables. I asked for the hot salsa, and it was the right level of spicy. The veggies tasted fresh enough and the meal was filling & healthy, but the rice was undercooked (my friend agreed the rice grains tasted hard).  I had noticed the associate give 2 HUGE scoops of cheese to a customer in front of me, but I barely got a half scoop so I asked for more.    The regular veggie burrito bowl (smallest size available) cost $4.99 + 75 cents extra for guacamole (no drink/chips). Total after taxes was $6.49 so this is fairly cheaper than Chipotle.   They have a rewards stamps card - buy 10 large burritos to get a free large, or 12 small burritos to get a free small.  Location is near office buildings so fairly busy at weekday lunch time with several tables inside."}
{"text":"not bad, from what I've had so far. Food seems centered on wraps, with various Subway-style options to customizing your meal, albeit Mexican-ized.  If you're just getting a wrap, it'll come in under the $10 mark, but a drink and a side-order will run you in the $12 range."}
{"text":"Can't believe I came here to eat. Had the 3 tacos and the food was stale and chicken tasted old. Went to complain and the people just answer me with an \"oh is it?\" I asked for a refund and was told manager wasn't on duty to give me a refund. Well they just lost my business completely as I work next door. This place shouldn't be allowed to operate with the expired food they serving."}
{"text":"There is much room for improvement, I think 2.5 is more appropriate but I will be generous. First of all the woman taking my order seemed to be new and having a hard time figuring it out. Let it be known they charge a dollar for guacamole and she gave me less than a teaspoon amount, I had to tell her to put more because that is ridiculous for a dollar. They precooked the vegetables and then reheat them in a oven... sigh... really ?! You can't cook them fresh? The rice was either stale or undercooked because it was hard. The flavours overall were pretty good, a little too much lemon in the rice for me but not bad. The other issue was the cilantro was all stems, they should either be chopping it fine or pulling the leafs off, why am I eating stems? I would not really recommend this place when fiesta burrito is right across in the grange where they don't charge you for guacamole and they cook their food fresh."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is appropriate, but Quesada is like a Mexican-Subway.  We've come here often and we're always pleased about the taste, quality and the price.  In the burrito department, we've tried the Bean Burrito, Spicy Chicken Burrito, and Ancho Pork Burrito. We've also tried the Chips & Salsa, and the Guacamole. The salsa is very tasty, and the Guacamole is a bit watery, but nonetheless yummy!  Be careful while picking how spicy you want your tacos/burritos. Their sauce is really spicy! I had the Medium spice for my Burrito, and I had a Haba√±ero sauce, and I was sweating bullets.   Anyhow, recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here 3 times now. Been closed every time! even when the website says they're open. won't be trying to come back"}
{"text":"I am from the states and I enjoy Chipotle from time to time. I find Quesada as good if not better. I am impressed with the food and the ambiance. It is also a very clean place."}
{"text":"Do yourself the favour and head to Mucho Burrito in St.Laurent or Vaudreuil , they just do it better and fresher than here . was not impressed , cannot see myself returning , Mucho Burrito has spoiled me for good counter service mexican food"}
{"text":"Decent burritos.  I've been there a few times later at night near closing, and some of the ingredients seemed a bit less than fresh and a bit dry, but it still hit the spot.  Fully customizable, and they really pile on the ingredients if you order the 'Big Ass' burrito.  Also, I'm not sure if it's the low lighting or the fact that they're licensed, but this place always seems a bit sketchy - never had any problems though."}
{"text":"Took advantage of the free 10\" steak quesadilla  (small size) promotion they had during February.  I ordered it with black beans, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno, medium spicy. Unfortunately, guac is extra cost. The steak was more on the chewy/tough side and it was quite bland. The sauce didn't taste medium spicy at all.   The Mexican pop in the pop cooler was a nice touch to the meal.  Overall, friendly and quick service. They really put in the effort to make your burrito, even when it is free. Good choice for a quick and affordable lunch in the finanical district."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and the rice tasted like it was sitting there for a long while.. Really hard."}
{"text":"Small portions, and stingy on the toppings. I would rather go to chipotle or burrito boyz across the street."}
{"text":"Love this place, it opened up not too long ago and I'm so happy it did. Their chicken quesadillas are so yummy and so is their tortilla salad. I have yet to try their tacos but I bet they're yummy. I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for Mexican or in a quick pinch and need something fast."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is a chain, and you all know about it already, but for a visitor like me, I should have thought twice or thrice about eating here.  I've had better chicken quesadillas in an airport..."}
{"text":"Disgusting burnt Burritos sent on Uber eats order. The wrap was so burnt you could taste the nasty char over anything. The burrito filling had no flavour, barely any meat and the salsa was liquid... This was the worst burrito I have ever had. They clearly have no pride in their product and will serve customers anything.  The most upsetting thing was... it wasn't just 1 burrito that was burnt to a horrible crisp, but all 4. UNACCEPTABLE! And certainly not fit for human consumption... I would not serve such poorly prepared food to a dog.  We ended up getting food poisoning from what little we had eaten. I had only eaten 1/4 a burrito. Save yourself the trouble and eat elsewhere as this place is not worth considering for a meal.   I will happily be returning to Bar Burrito.  Never again Quesada, never again!"}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch.  It was totally underwhelming.  I ordered the fish burrito.  A total disappointment.  The fish portion was tiny.  They are very stingy with their toppings.  And the burrito was $6.99+ tax.  Simply underwhelming.  Burritos everywhere else are better (mucho burrito is better, chino locos, burrito boyz and burrito bandidos...you get the picture).  And I was hungry, I think if I weren't, it would have received 1 star.  Not likely to return, even if starving."}
{"text":"My work catered a whole bunch of food from here and to be honest... everything was off. The food was ordered mild and it was still somewhat spicy and that bothered some people. The taste was underwhelming and I stopped short as I didn't want to get sick from this. The guacamole probably the worst I've tasted in awhile and it somewhat watery? Weird.  I filled up on their decent salsa and nacho chips. That was OK."}
{"text":"Me and a few colleagues stumbled on this fast food joint while we were out for lunch. The place looked clean upon arrival with some seating. We arrived during lunch rush and there were customers getting takeout.   Service was adequate. Not much interaction for a fast food joint. It was as expected.  Food was very average, maybe a bit below average. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito bowl and the chicken was very bland. The reason why this place gets only two stars is because of the amount of food they give. The bowl was nowhere near full. Compared to other Mexican fast food joints, this franchise (or maybe just this location) cheaps out on their ingredients. Me and my coworkers noticed there wasn't much rice and meat and the food was nowhere near the top of the bowl. We will definitely not come back here."}
{"text":"The burrito is my favourite American fast food invention; if I am not mistaken, it was invented in California.  I believe the Mexican burrito is much simpler and smaller than the ginormously, filling burrito prepared in North America.  I've had burrito at Freshwest Grill, Chipotle and Steamrollers (which I much later discovered is a Vancouver creation of a transplanted San Francisco guy). For a fast food item, I have ridiculously high expectations of it.  I liked that this location was not busy on a Saturday lunch time(then again, most people were out having brunch, and not been up for 5 hours already).  I ordered the steak burrito, thinking it was the grilled sirloin streak as served in Freshwest. No, it was shredded meat. And I didn't catch it until it had already been served, along with the rice and beans. I apologized to the guy behind the counter preparing it, and told him that was not what I had in mind. He was super cool about it and he started from scratch again. This time, I ordered the spicy chicken, spicy and mild sauce, and diced tomatoes and cheese. I was disappointed in the selection of items. It just seemed less, or they simply don't have grilled veggies like Chipotle and Freshwest Grill do.  Since I was going to have a busy afternoon, I decided to make it a large, combo burrito. I mistakenly thought I would get guacamole with the chips so I skipped it in my burrito. Nope, it's regular sauce.  But no biggie. That was my own omission!  The actual burrito ended up being spicier than what I normally have the other 2 mentioned locations!  Despite that, the flavour is different. It's less flavoursome. I didn't like it.    While it wasn't to my satisfaction, the staff is very good and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Pretty decent fast food joint. This chain has filled a gap in the GMA food scene; it's really disappointing that cheap Mexican food is not that common around here.   Don't expect the food to be super authentic or soulful; this is strictly Subway-style assembly line tacos and burritos. The staff are not very knowledgeable about Mexican food. The service is hit or miss; one crew is super quick and courteous, and other times they can be crude and lethargic.   Overall, I keep going back because the taste is good especially for the price, and because I need tacos."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito chains, for me. This location is consistent over years, staff is great. Under $6 for a large tasty bean burrito, whole wheat option,  cheaper and tastier than many other places.   AND they will give you a glass of water, not like many joints that try to force you to buy bottled plastic garbage water.  I love Quesada!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place, I got a spicy chicken burrito bowl for take-out as I was running late. The total was about $9.  The Good: - Super friendly service, the guys were pleasant - The spicy chicken tasted alright  The Bad: - Crunchy rice, inedible - Bit into a piece of chicken gristle - Poor value (in terms of amount and quality of ingredients) compared to other burrito places - Very little sauce  Overall: - Not good. I barely ate this and wasn't satisfied at all. I'm a regular at so many other burrito places, this one bites the dust.  - I only dropped by here because of the crazy rain storm. Likely never to try again."}
{"text":"Had to be at my hubby's office. And we wanted to grab something quick around the area. Everything was pretty much closed (Sun Easter) but this joint was open. Place is very clean.   Ordered a:  Large Spicy Chicken Ancho Pork Burrito It was huge. Taste of Ok but no wow factor. It was freshing not heavy and filled my hunger.   A Chile Lime Fish Burrito Bowl Fish was not dry and it was ok as well.   Overall I think this place is more aimmed  towards the healthier side. Kind of like Subways. They have all the calories counts on each item. So if you are looking for a healthier option of burrito & tacos. I think this place is for you."}
{"text":"Quesada is my guilty Mexican food pleasure. I am in love (ok more like lust) with their breakfast bowls. $3.99 for a super filling breakfast (basically an early lunch for me) which is their burrito bowls but with eggs instead of a meat. It's absolutely delicious and hearty tasting :D I can see why there are lots of poor reviews for this place though as their ingredients don't always taste super fresh (ie closer to closing time). But for breakfast/lunch, I haven't had any issues and actually find their bowls and nachos/guac very tasty. They also serve beer here which is a huge plus! I'll come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Half way between a Taco Bell and a mom and pop Mexican shop. Cheap, quick and half decent Mexican fare. I may go back."}
{"text":"I REALLY ENJOY the location that this store is in; it's near where I go to school, where I yoga and where I work. It was a great bite to grab for lunch, dinner whatever - on the go. I felt that it was great deal - and I particularly love the abundance of cilantro they put- because I always found that nobody EVER gives me enough cilantro. It was yummy in my tummy, and that was good enough for me. I recall really LOVING this spot and thought it was excellent deal until I discovered Burrito Boyz.  Then I noticed that they simply don't grill the burrito long enough- the tortilla is not crispy - and I didn't think this was an issue until I had the shrimp option where the less then crisp tortilla didn't help hold the sogginess of the burrito. Their ONLY seafood choice is Lime-shrimp in which you cannot taste the lime marinade anywhere. -this turned out the be a  gigantic minus, as my new found love happens to be Haddock. Still love the abundance of cilantro.   While it's a great option for lunch -because there 's not very much diversity around here you can gobble up - for the price they charge, there are much MUCH better options."}
{"text":"While the food was fine and actually pretty good overall in value when I order a meal I expect them to make it. I ordered the roasted veggie burrito and was told it would take a few minutes. No prob. Husband ordered his we get to the case and then when I say I'm waiting on mine the people are baffled like I never had the conversation. They were very nice and apologetic but it was obvious they are lacking in training.  I also am not a big fan of calling anything on a menu \"big ass\".  Rude and unnecessary."}
{"text":"Well its no Chipotle, but it will do.  I was never impressed with these guys when I was living in Toronto, but the two Calgary locations I've been to have been alright. Customer service at both locations has been quite excellent in fact.  My biggest issue with Quesada is that the meat always seems to be a little dry. Also, as with many burrito places, I'm tired of getting \"the look\" when I ask for my burrito not to be toasted. Sigh..."}
{"text":"My coworker and I noticed Quesada as we were walking on Dundas looking for a new lunch place. The interior is painted a welcoming red with a couple tables and chairs for diners. Most of the customers are employees from nearby buildings coming for take out.  We ordered regular sized burrito bowls with an extra side of guacamole (75 cents only!). The servers were generous with toppings and the lid barely fit. I got spicy chicken as the protein, which the man working said was a crowd favorite. The total came to about $8.50, which is a reasonable price for take-out in the area.   The guacamole was REALLY good and they definitely didn't skimp. I would come by again."}
{"text":"I come here once a week for a spicy chicken burrito. Great taste, good service and a healthy meal for under $8 including tax. And you are in-and-out in no time."}
{"text":"food was alright but staff was just rude. as it was my first time there I did not know what was good and the portions they put were so small. the staff looked like they were annoyed and when I asked her to put extra lettuceshw rolled her eyes. Never coming back."}
{"text":"The staff is fantastic but the owner is extremely rude, I have never walked out of a restaurant feeling more insulted in my life. I was told \" you can't use debit because what you purchased isn't worth the cost using the debit machine charges me\". I would have thought the over priced Gatorade would have covered it but I guess not. My advice, keep walking by.."}
{"text":"The person working the counter was very nice. It was my first time visiting Calgary from the USA and I wasn't sure what denominations the coins were. He explained it to me and even took the time to chat with me about Calgary. I ordered the \"Big Ass Burrito\" with spicy chicken. They weren't kidding when they said it was big! I didn't even think we could wrap the burrito with all the toppings he placed in it. But he did and said \"good enough for two meals: dinner then breakfast tomorrow.\" He was right. I ate what I could there and packed the rest back to the hotel. Thanks for the pleasant experience, good food, and company!"}
{"text":"I think the management changed recently so it's gotten really better.  I have been going there everyday for the past week. Well it might also have something to do with my recent obsession with burritos but still. Once I got the combination right I can't help but crave for quesada every day at lunch.  Very friendly and accommodates special requests."}
{"text":"I stop by this place frequently for some Mexican fast food cuisine.  The food is freshly made right in front of your eyes with your choice of ingredients.  Keep in mind, with the music and kitchen machinery running at the same time, be prepared to yell your order as the servers will then hear you, sort of like in the ending to Back to the Future where Marty McFly is yelling at Doc Brown is on the top of the building with the giant clock awaiting for lightning to strike."}
{"text":"I've got my brother to thank for finding this place! What an amazing burrito / taco. The size is one thing (make sure you're hungry!!) but it the quality of ingredients! You can taste the freshness in each part, be it the veggies or the meat. It's nicely wrapped, filled and toasted. The regular is a good size, the large is pretty large and the big ass size... Make sure you have the appetite for it!!  The homemade salsa and chips def something to try!   It's now my go to place when I want either of those! The only issue I had was with the steak. I love steak but the ones they serve just weren't as tender as Id like. The chicken / pork (even the mixes) are delicious! Lastly excellent service!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Quesada a try during the Cinco De Mayo promotion ($5 burritos for 5 days).  The recent influx of fast food restaurants in my area has been a welcome change in my area and Quesada is the newest of these.  This location is conveniently located at Airport and Queen St in Brampton.  The store is brightly lit and highlighted with neon green and red colors, there is enough seating for a store of the this size.  The menu board is easily navigated and the staff here are friendly and will walk you through if there are any questions.  I ordered as steak burrito and my favourite Mexican pop Jarritos ( if you like pop this is a great one to try...especially the lime one!!)  The burrito was a good size and the fillings were fresh and hot!! I felt a little rushed because the location closed at 9pm.  I found this a little early for most fast food restaurants because most people are looking for a convenient place to eat at hours like this.    Quesada is another burrito chain trying to make its mark in the area along with Burrito Boyz and Chipotle.  The quality of the product is good and the location convenient.  A good quality start 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent!  The customer service is not and as soon as the lunch rush comes in, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp Burrito, What I received was some of the worst tasting shrimp in my life.  It tasted as though it was microwaved it was so rubbery and tough!  Seriously buyer beware!   Really bad!  Service is still good and efficient but the Shrimp really was horrible!"}
{"text":"I didn't take a picture, was just hungry. I had a spicy chicken burrito and I've also asked them to add spicy salsa which end up giving a nice kick. Pretty spicy which I like. Good thing I can pick rice without beans because I just hate beans. The burrito was wrapped pretty well so not much spillage during eating."}
{"text":"This was my second lunch-time visit to Quesada since their opening at Yonge and Eglinton a couple months ago.  It is a welcome addition to the area, and is clearly better than Moe's (around the corner on Eglinton East).  I had a regular (which is the small size) chilli-lime shrimp burrito.  They do a few kinds of burritos (different meats) and they also do tacos with the same meats.  In response to a previous reviewers comments, I was given the choice of white or whole wheat.  My burrito was well-topped with lettuce, tomato, salsa, black beans, rice, jalapenos, cilantro, and corn.  I was a little disappointed with the shrimp - there were only 5 of them (although they were a decent size) and the staff heated them with a microwave or convection oven (or whatever that thing is) before putting them on the burrito.  Unfortunately they did not heat them enough, as they were only slightly warm.  More importantly, I could not taste any chilli or any lime, on my chilli-lime shrimp burrito.  Perhaps I had too many other toppings.    All in all though, the burrito was very tasty, and the cilantro mixed well with the rice and beans and other toppings.  At $7 (tax included), it was not a large lunch for the price by any means, and I would recommend that people with a very large appetite definitely get the larger size, for a couple extra dollars.  The chicken and beef burritos are a little cheaper than the shrimp though, and given my comments about the shrimp, might be better choices."}
{"text":"I happened to be walking by and am very happy that I made the decision to go in for dinner. It's a very tidy and cute little place and I absolutely loved the food. I had a roasted veggies and bean burrito bowl and was quite impressed by the flavors of the dish, especially with the $4.99 price! All the ingredients were fresh and I especially loved the salsa and cilantro lime sauce. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Ok, I am giving this place 4 stars because I am comparing it to the Calgary market, which is dismal as far as Mexican food is concerned. I've had pretty much everything on the menu but stick to the 3 tacos for about $9, and add on onions & peppers for .75. i always get the hot salsa, habanero mayo, extra jalapenos which are fresh and the habanero hot sauce. Does the trick for me until i can make it back down south."}
{"text":"Solid Burrito for lunch today. Better then Buritto Boys. Very tasty with quality ingredients. The staff were polite & efficient. The price was excellent. Nothing to complain about"}
{"text":"This place only serves only brown rice. Had the chicken burrito. too much lettuce making the food bland. The chicken doesn't have a strong flavor taste like say Chipotle Grill etc. I have mentioned to a colleague from Mexico and he said he doesn't really like this place too much either. Not a big fan.   Won't come back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The outdoor area is great and the food is good as well.  Probably not a place for the \"foodie\" people or burrito snobs, but a cool place to grab a meal and hang out for a bit.  Staff is always friendly and does a good job with my order every time.  What's up with the (lack of) salsa though?  Maybe it's a Canadian thing, but these guys give the smallest portion of salsa I've ever seen...and I travel a lot and eat this kind of food often."}
{"text":"Don't actually have much to contribute to other reviews... but feel like I have to write a few notes after having paid a visit.  I guess I can say we are somewhat spoiled now in GTA with all the burrito options we have here. The competition is very serious and these guys are not doing their best to keep up.   On the plus side, the place looks fresh and the food is safe to eat.  On the minus side, the food tasted meh.   It's fast food with the emphasis on the word \"fast\"."}
{"text":"Love this place. They do burritos right.  I've had burritos from Fat Bastard, Burrito Boyz, Chipotle, and I have to say these are by far my favourite. You can actually taste how fresh all the ingredients are, which makes it that much better.  I haven't tried any other items on their menu, but I usually get their Spicy Chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot since there are not alot of burrito / Mexican places in this area. With that being said was disappointment.  Cafeteria style store front. Clean, with great staff and service.  The food for the price when compared to other locations is not worth it. The examples they have displayed up doesnt help either. The food taste is average nothing overly unique. The rice was not cooked properly. Overall was lacking.    The only thing I enjoyed was the Habanero and Garlic sauce, added much needed flavor to my bowl. You pay extra for guacamole.   Compared to other places, I've had better. Not inclined to go back."}
{"text":"It's a filling lunch for under 10 dollars. I always get a spicy chicken burrito, but I agree with another reviewer that it is a little dry. I'm tempted to try their tip in getting the grilled chicken instead. The big ass burrito is way too big. You might want to get it to impress your friends, or have a laugh, but generally most people should not be eating this much. I used to always get the large burrito because I thought it presented the best value. Now I just get the regular size and I am still satisfied. If you want to be a little healthier, try the regular and don't forget the whole wheat! :)"}
{"text":"super unimpressed! my family and I were road tripping up to Windsor last month. we stopped in here for a quick lunch. it was around 12 on a Friday and the place was dead. there were about 5 staff but zero customers. my boyfriend and sister both ordered the chicken quesadilla and I ordered the shrimp quesadilla. a woman started making theirs. after the other two were already made I was told that the shrimp was frozen and couldn't be defrosted in time. seriously?? this is your promoted item and it's not ready? fine. I ordered the veggie quesadilla instead. the quesadillas were really big but mine absolutely sucked, the chicken ones supposedly weren't great either. mine was soggy and tasteless, the veggies tasted as though they'd been sitting there for days. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's like a Chipotle but not as good.   Located on 11th Ave 2 doors down from Starbucks and beside the new subway.    It's a pretty small place with only 3 tables and small side bar area.  So if you come during lunch hour be prepared to takeout.    I got a spicy chicken burrito bowl.  It was ok.   My complaint is that I wish the hot items were hotter in temperature and not just warm.  Makes a huge difference.  They could probably get away with it being only warm in the  Burritos and quesadillas cuz those are grilled but the bowls are not.   They opened two months ago.   I would give them another chance and try other items... Maybe an item that they grill so it would be hot and not just warm."}
{"text":"best burritos, so many options and they pile it on!  I love this place and wish Montreal had more of them!"}
{"text":"Not HORRIBLE, but their location across from Fairview is MUCH better.  Rude employees in both locations though.  Took out meal to go and the quesadilla was way too soggy and the burrito was \"boring halfway through\". Not going back to this one, but we will be trying the poutinerie next door soon!"}
{"text":"Brrr-eee-toe with cheese?!?!  FCUK YEAH!!!  While my first impression of this place was that it would be another failed attempt at a franchise burrito joint (a lot like Moe's down the street), I was happily surprised to see that it was much more than just that.   While there are a handful of better fast food Mexican joints in the city, this place is a nice and welcome addition to the yonge n eggy area. I'd say it stands head and shoulders above Moe's and is direct competition for chipotle which plans to open up down the street as well.   While I'm not a fan of the steak taco...particularly when u compare it to the braised beef at chipotle, the chicken burrito won both me and my beloved belly over and had us come back demanding more the very next day! If you ask for spicy, you get spicy...n I dig that! The hot sauce packs a mean punch which makes this place worth while. Not to mention they're not shy on the guac...and the cheese is offered a free topping as well.  Yeah it's not the best burrito...but I won't lie, I'm lovin the fact it opened up close to my work. Mucho gracias!"}
{"text":"Way too stingy with the toppings and beans. And they charge extra for a smidgen of guacamole even on the vegetarian burritos. Usually the guacamole is free on the veg ones!!! But they don't warm you it will be extra. Vegetables are also overcooked. Very bland burrito.  Muchos is better for potions and taste for 'take-out' Mexican.  Will not return."}
{"text":"VIBE  I don't know why everyone raves about this place. Just because you're $2-3 cheaper than Chipotle does not mean you are the Juan enchilada (or whatever Mexican terminology I'm supposed to be using. Why can't I just say \"bee's knees?!\") YOU ARE NOT THE BEE'S KNEES. Now I feel better.   I digress.   It's nice and clean inside. Staff are on but a bit off too. If it's slow, they will just stare at you until you make a decision. Annoying. If it's busy? Know your order.   I ATE  The buritto is OK. I usually go for the chicken quesadillas because I can't get them at Chipotle but they're not that great. The chicken falls out of them quickly. Surprisingly, I think they're less than the guac and chips combo (WTF? Seriously).   The chicken soft tacos are pretty good. I think that will be my new default but I also think there needs to be more flavour.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Quesada. Que\"meh\" sa. Good if you're starving or you get dragged by coworkers. Chipotle is my go-to fast food Mexican in the Yonge/Eg area. Case closed."}
{"text":"I came here for the burrito bowl. Just needed a nice quick dinner downtown that's convenient after work for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food. Negative stars for the service. One star overall.  I've been here twice and while the food is nothing to write home about, the service has been uniformly atrocious both times. The first time, the server was just rude and refused to answer my question. The second time they toasted my burrito for so long (basically forgot about it) that it got burned! Plus they are very tardy with refilling their empty containers.  I feel bad about giving the place such a poor rating but I think it's deserved."}
{"text":"On my trip to Canada we stopped by close to our hotel and wanting some Mexican food fast and with a 4 star review I'm sure all the reviews were from the Owens friends the food came from a microwave oven we watched the staff heat up the meat. Please don't waste your time or Money"}
{"text":"I've past this chain so many times and finally got a chance to check it out this summer. At a quick glance, it seems like a down market Chipotles with the same type of prices. We tried it out and the food was decent but the place was a little messy. I would go back, but only do takeout."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner and had the spicy chicken burrito with guacamole.  The only real flavor the burrito had was a bit of spiciness... other than that it was surprisingly blah. Same goes for the guacamole, i think it was just mashed up avocado. There was nothing blatantly bad about any of it, just lacked flavor.   That being said, the service was quick and a large burrito was only $7.  However, next time I'll probably take a walk up the road a little ways and hit Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great food, that will fill you up, basically Mexican Subways Get a burrito if you want to get the most for your money"}
{"text":"I'd like to know what cans they get their sauces out of, so I can avoid ever buying those brands at the grocery store. Guacamole sucked, as did the quesadilla and fish taco. The only thing of the whole meal that was any good was the sour cream. Two thumbs down. Now I have to make myself dinner."}
{"text":"This is the nearest place from the new office for a bite so ended up here anyways.  2 stars for clean non-greasy joint.   Food, m'eh! Ordered rice bowl with spicy chicken. Extra stingy with toppings and spicy chicken was just dipped in hot chili sauce it seemed.  Taco was same. M'eh! Extra charge for guacamole which happened to be a smudge smaller than a child's pinky.  Heading to adjoining subway next time."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Quesada before this one, but I pass it all the time while pondering my food choices. So decided to stop in.   Have to say, their burritos are pretty delicious. The spicy chicken is yummy, if a little dry sometimes. But I have watched as they've heated the chicken in the toaster contraption on the counter, perhaps that is the main reason for the dryness. Their sauces are exactly the right spicy compliment and can make sitting at your desk, post-lunch, a very uncomfortable experience.   The big difference here is the service. There is a guy, whom I can only assume is a manager of some sort, is always there quickly pounding out the orders and keeping everyone else on track. I appreciate that kind of thing. If I am purchasing fast food, I really am looking for a quick experience. Even when faced with a person ordering for 7 other people from her office (believe me, I got stuck behind her), they very quickly dispatched those 8 orders and moved on through the line."}
{"text":"Inoffensive, if inauthentic, Quesada is a late entrant to the Yonge-Eglinton Burrito Wars. Just south of the most commercial end of the stir, you'd be forgiven for missing it, although business is pretty steady.   Service is always polite and often tattooed.   Options will be familiar to those with a serious burrito addiction; chicken, pork, steak, and fish, braised or grilled.   Quesada wins points for offering a salad version and multiple burrito sizes (unlike other chains that charge a tonne and offer one gigantic option), but lose a star for a more complicated ordering scheme.   Different chicken and pork options are priced differently, which I don't understand since it's all portioned out using the same small scoops dipped into the same troughs. Protein portions feel a bit skimpy, but a wide variety of veggies and salsas mitigate somewhat. It's a shame that they charge for guacamole.  I skip after seeing the scant teaspoon my 75 cents would buy me.   The majority of diners opt for a small chicken burrito. I follow suit. It's A-OK, as Yelp's rating system would suggest. Not a chicken for which I'd cross the road, but I don't leave overstuffed, and my wallet is relatively intact."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place: it's like a Mexican Subway restaurant, only better!  Been twice in the past two days, ordered burritos which were prepared fresh in front of me. I love that I pick exactly what I want in it, it's tasty, no frills, affordable, there's something for everyone. The \"Big Ass\" 14 inch burrito is hilarious, all wrapped up- it looks like a newborn baby! For the average person, you would have to finish it in two sittings and bringing back leftovers means you have at least a pound of food remaining. I get incredibly excited for restaurants that serve huge portions so this place is right up my alley.  You have to try their cilantro-lime-sour cream sauce, so simple but adds that perfect zing to every bite.  They don't charge extra for sour cream, which is great, since other popular Mexican sit down chains do.  Opt for the trio, you get tortilla chips with your choice of dip and unlimited fountain drink refills for just 2$ more.  Bonus: - They have a fidelity card. Accumulate stamps based on your purchase. Big Ass Burrito gives you 3 stamps for example, on your 12th stamp you get a free meal and on your 20th stamp too. - They offer catering. Mexican fiesta anyone?! - Free wifi."}
{"text":"This is the best burrito place in the GTA.   The burrito I normally opt for is the veggie ( everything on it, black beans and brown rice with habanero sauce).   The food is undoubtedly fresh, quantities are great, sauces (habanero) are awesome!  Lunchtimes (12pm) are busy, so try to come at 11am or 1pm onwards."}
{"text":"Need a healthy grilled chicken burrito on a whole wheat wrap? This place is your go to place. Came in after a New Year's Eve workout and ate every last bite of my burrito. The service is friendly and we will be back! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Mon amoureuse et moi y sommes allez plusieurs fois depuis l'ouverture et avons ador√© l'exp√©rience !   Un peu comme un \"subway\" mexicain, on peut choisir notre burrito/taco/etc ainsi que notre viande et nos  l√©gumes. Les portions sont tr√®s g√©n√©reuses et les prix sont semblables aux autres cha√Ænes de restauration rapide.   Le seul petit point \"√† am√©liorer\" pourrait √™tre d'ajouter des options trio. Le seul choix offert est un accompagnement de chips tortilla et, bien quelle soient accompagn√©es d'un peu de salsa, on s'en lasse plut√¥t rapidement... Le service est excellent et les employ√©s sont toujours souriants et semblent bien s'entendre entre eux...ce qui rend l'endroit tr√®s agr√©able!  √Ä essayer absolument √† votre prochain arr√™t-resto sur C√¥te-des-Neiges!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this new Mexican resto on the corner of Cote-St.-Catherine & Cote-des-Neiges. It is really nice because it offers a healthy option. The toppings are fresh and you have a good choice of meats (beef, chicken/spicy chicken, fish fillets). I always order the regular burrito because I like it so much. Their sauces are super tasty (my fav is the sour cream w/ lime and coriander) and I like how they have a choice between brown or white rice. You make it as spicy or as mild as YOU want! Return worthy for sure!"}
{"text":"Warm in the outside, cold on the inside. Meat was hard, stale and cold. Veggies were fresh and plentiful"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good... food was pretty tasty. I had the spicy chicken burrito regular size. The chicken was flavorful as it's fresh he'd in sauce, and I also added jalape√±os and hot sauce.. The regular size was a decent lunch portion.  The not so good part of my review..the service and staff. I have never been to this place before, so being my first time I asked the woman behind the counter which meat was their most popular as I was contemplating possibly trying the ancho pork, she shrugged and made a 'don't know' kind of face, and suggested any of them except the ancho pork. I told her I'd try the spicy chicken. She starts making my burrito - warms up the tortilla, adds rice and then the beans and passes it off to the next girl. The next girl starts dumping the plain chicken in it, not the one I asked for - I stopped her part way through and told her that's not the one I wanted. She stood there for a few minutes making a face and staring for answers at the previous woman behind the counter. What an awkward few minutes..! The other woman instructs her to make another and they both kind of shrug as she puts the other one to the side, I sure what to do with it as if it's somehow my fault.    The rest of my burrito process went okay, but overall it was an unpleasant, not the friendliest experience - especially for a first timer.  There's definite room for improvement here in terms of customer service."}
{"text":"Theres one in my campus and I'm going to state the obvious, but here's ten times better"}
{"text":"The service is hilarious and the burritos are tasteless. It's not worth your time, just go to Chipotle or something."}
{"text":"Unless for some reason you can't  go to chipotles, burrito boyz or burrito bandidos, and you really need to satisfy your burrito fix, then I guess you can come here.. I got a steak and spicy chicken burrito.. No real flavour in the meat.. The fillings were kind of watery.. When they toasted the burrito, it was still kind of soggy.. I don't see why people would go here so often.. And if you're used to getting a large burrito, this place's small is about the same size as a burrito boyz small"}
{"text":"Delicious, good service, good sauce options, ample seating, clean washrooms, fresh ingredients, but guacamole is .75 cents. Enough parking also."}
{"text":"I was surprised how good this place was as most mexican places in Montreal are pretty bad. It reminded me of Florida style fast food and build it as you like. I will go back when I need my mex fix. Even my kids love it."}
{"text":"Chipotle-esque in style, but the quality wasn't great. Dry meat, bland flavors, probably won't visit again even though I live close."}
{"text":"People who work there do not speak clearly and are confused.   The meat was bland,  they are extremely stingy with the toppings.  I asked for corn and got 5 kernels, asked for more and got 3 more kernels, paid extra for guacamole and got barely a mouthful scraped onto the side of my takeout container, the cheese looked fake and nothing looked fresh.  I rather go to Chipotle and wait in line for a long time and pay $5 more."}
{"text":"Got a free small burrito through their email promotion so decided to try it out. It was ok. Kinda salty. I added chips & salsa with it, and that was also salty.   I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this meal. I don't think I would."}
{"text":"Worse customer service and knowledges of their menu. They have a menu for kids and when I went with my son they won't let me buy from it unless I buy any regular menu which they should have said on the menu board and they don't care to return customer away"}
{"text":"This place will rip you, (and your cute kid who insists on ordering her own dinner), off in a New York, (or in this case - Toronto), minute and not think twice about it.  For example, my daughter ordered a \"cheese quesadilla please\"...whereupon she was asked, \"would you like a small or large?\"...\"large please\"...\"do you want meat?\", \"No thank you\", \"Beans, corn, tomatoes, salsa, onions\"...\"No thank you, just cheese please...\"  Only at check out was Daddy informed that the $3 kids cheese quesadilla is only available in small and that the \"large\" that was offered to the cute and polite little girl is only available at full cost - slightly more than TWICE the price, despite the fact that it's only a slightly larger cheese quesadilla.  Had it not been late and with a hungry child, I'd have walked out...  Horrible customer service, I will never eat there again...even under duress."}
{"text":"Taste like water, no flavors what so ever I ordered the spicy chicken burrito. Very underwhelming and not seasoned at all. My friend ordered the chicken tacos and had the same opinion."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and have had a good experience. The two times we have went it's never been busy so there's never a wait.   Last week we had the burrito bowl with half grilled chicken and steak. It's a good amount for lunch. I was only able to finish half of it and ate the rest later on.  The restaurant is clean and there are plenty of tables."}
{"text":"Had the Fish Burrito Bowl, and I was pretty pumped about it! Huge slice of fish, and lots of fresh ingredients! I went during the lunch rush, so it was a bit of a line up, but worth it! Prices are ok for the serving size. I will definitely return.  (my coworker got the 3 taco deal and was not as pumped as i was - i looked at his when we got back to the office and they were some pretty sad tacos - very empty! I'll probably stick to the burrito bowl!)"}
{"text":"Don't say that you offer delivery if you won't deliver. It's plain and simple. Why on earth would you falsely state that you deliver and then when someone tries to place an order, you say that you don't deliver. Also, don't say that you \"don't know because the manager isn't here\" when asked why you won't deliver. You're an employee, you should be able to answer customers' questions."}
{"text":"Efficient process. First thoughts was a knock off of Chipotle but very different tastes. There Chipotle sauce was very good. Green / mild salsa was not my favorite. I wish staff was a little more helpful when selecting. Seemed more like they wanted me to just order and move on which I understand for this style of restaurant however I was the only one here.   Fresh ingredients, loved the second heating / toasting of burrito shell, would definitely come back again."}
