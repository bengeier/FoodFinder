{"text":"It's always a good idea to give a place more than one try before a review. I've come once a week since they opened (I've only gotten the lunch buffet) and it's consistently gotten better. They've clearly listened to feedback from somewhere (social media? customers? reviews?). They've doubled the size of their buffet, added additional lighting and decor, and sometimes play music. The buffet (now a bargain at $9.99) includes a good variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices, and everything is well-cooked and very, very good.  They still need to work on the ambiance a bit by playing music all the time or a TV show or something - it's either deathly quiet with just the sounds of chewing and forks on plates or being unable to avoid eavesdropping on others' conversations.  Limited staff who are often in stealth mode - they're generally nice and helpful, but you have to track them down and ask questions."}
{"text":"Tried it over weekend and wondered why the bad reviews as well. Nice people and really good food."}
{"text":"I came for dinner on a Sunday. Overall I thought the food was good but service was slow and it was way too quiet in there. After about 15 minutes music turned on in background but it took close to 40 minutes for our food to come out which is way too long when there's only 2 other tables in here and temp on food could have been warmer especially for long we waited"}
{"text":"This place is perfect place for Indian Nepali food lovers. I went there with my friends and was great environment with really authentic delicious food ever had around this area. I order chicken tikka Masala was heavenly. All of the items they served was great with quick and friendly service. Desert kulfi omg !  I recommend all the people around here to try once. 100% you gonna feel great after you visit this place. They also started there lunch specials just in $6.99 with lots of variety. Non of the Indian restaurant will beat this price . Just wow wow and wow."}
{"text":"I am sooo excited Kent FINALLY has a great Indian restaurant!!! Thank you Namaste for adding some much needed diversity to Kent's dining choices."}
{"text":"A new Indian restaurant managed by a small family. They have been improving overtime. I like Lamb Biryani and Chilly Chicken, but man today I tried their Chicken Tikka Masala. It was one of the best I've ever had in my life! I'm confident because Chicken Tikka Masala/Butter Chicken is my all time favorite Indian dish.
They also offer a buffet daily except Mondays for $ 9.99. It has a decent variety of food, vegetarian and non vegetarian!
Kent deserves a good Indian restaurant and finally got one!
PS Halal food."}
{"text":"If you are in Kent, Ohio... You need to go here and get some real deal Indian food. Namaste is a small hole in the wall joint which is a welcomed arrival for sure in the little college city. Samosas, curry and vegetarian dishes oh my!

When we entered it has a plain, easy feel about it. We were greeted and we got a seat in one of their many booths. The smell was heavenly. We were greeted with water, but they have regular drinks and Indian based beverages.

I got the beef curry with a spice level of 6 (yes they do have levels), I was amazed at the taste and you could taste every bit of flavor in the sauce. The seasoning is amazing!

I got to enjoy my sis tikki masala and the lamb curry at a spice 9. As a fan of spice, I was beyond pleased. They have bollywood films and Indian music videos playing while you eat.

5 stars for a great overall experience. Friendly staff and awesome food. Thanks Namaste!"}
{"text":"If you've always wanted to explore far away lands but lack the financial means to do so, food from your unreachable destinations is the next best thing. At Namaste Cuisine, your palette can try dishes that you truly can't find anywhere near the Kent area. 
 There papadams are one of my favorite snacks; light & crispy with a delicious chutney for dipping. My husband ordered chicken momo & aloo zeera; practically licking the plate clean. And the hammered copper cups & bowls the food was served in are absolutely beautiful! 
 Along with friendly service & fresh food, you will find a quiet/cozy atmosphere that is an inviting change from the typical over crowded restaurant chains in the area."}
{"text":"40 minutes before any food was brought out, small portions and expensive. Food is ok though. Im not going back. We had tandoori chicken, tiki masala, chicken momo, and naan."}
{"text":"Place opened a month ago so outta just getting started. Very good food and I highly recommend it. The owner is nice and will guide you through the menu if you're new to Indian food."}
