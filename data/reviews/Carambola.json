{"text":"Very good ambiance , excellent menu, a little on the salty side for me , but overall fantastic. Try the general Tao."}
{"text":"The owners are fantastic! Food is unique and prepared with a lot of thought! It's quaint and cozy with a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the area. Great service and always willing to make accommodations for allergies or dietary restrictions. Chef-owned with an open kitchen! Some acoustic treatment would be helpful as it can get a little loud."}
{"text":"Fantastic, creative restaurant great for couples and intimate groups. The food is amazing and the fact that the restaurant is BYOB is an amazing plus. Would recommend to anyone & everyone!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here this evening. I won't tell you what we ordered because you have to experience the place for yourself. I will tell you that we had a total of 5 tapas plates and each and every one of them was prepared to perfection.  I am very picky witb meat and seafood but plate after plate.....it was just getting better and better. The place was packed for a Wednesday and a little on the loud side but I would definitley eat there again. There is no doubt that the owner is passsionate about what he does.....it shows in the service and quality."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant in Hudson.  Great ambience. The food speaks for itself. Scott the owner is one of the best chefs I know, and always makes you feel welcome. Special orders , call in advance he can make pretty much and thing you want."}
{"text":"Carambola is this small restaurant situated in Hudson. Which is the outskirts of Montreal. Roughly a 25-30 min drive from downtown. Sadly, Carambola did not impress me. Here's why!  Upon looking at their Facebook page and website, their photos were nothing but beautiful and impressive. Also very deceiving!  When entering the restaurant, I've noticed a poorly decorated ambiance, paint chipping, flowers  in a vase still in their wrapping. Decorations on the wall simply placed with a very unappealing hook. Music being loud, and a bit of a rock style to it.  The food; It was simply just Ok! Do keep in mind this restaurant does NOT have a alcohol license. So bring your own is a must.  I've ordered the fish and chips. Which the fish was cooked perfectly and tender, with a crispy and non-greasy coating. Wonderful!  The chips(French fries) I'd rather not mention them since they were overlooked, bitter, and soggy.  The tartar sauce was a mixture of mayo and not sure what else it had. Since the only thing I taste was mayo. Which is not the same as tartar sauce!  The soup was tasty, yet the baby spinach  salad that came along with it was tender, but very soggy. Far too much dressing! The steak with asparagus risotto was an interesting combination. Steak was cooked more on the medium rare. The waitress recommended to have it medium rare or you won't like it. Hmm. Ok?  The risotto was very much al-dente(chewy) but tasty. The asparagus were very good. Sadly I only had three pieces. The steak was already sliced, again only 3-4 pieces. If you do not appreciate meat on the rare side, this dish is not for you.   When thinking of perhaps ordering coffee, I noticed the Nespresso machine with the capsules?! First time that  I see that in a restaurant that charged me $50+ for a table of two. For lunch!  Espresso lovers or good coffee lovers.. Move on. This certainly is not the place to appreciate a good coffee. Unfortunately!   If you don't mind a lovely quiet drive, I would somewhat suggest Carambola. Otherwise I'd suggest other places that may require less of a drive and a better ambiance. I found the quality and taste of their food not impressive. Which tends to happen in restaurants where you bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Got a glimpse of this restaurant at the 'taste of west island' event and put it on my bucket list ever since. In a word, WOW! Had the carpaccio, tuna poke, pork perrogies, bison stew and chocolate torte to finish. Everything was delicious and done perfectly well. We will put this place on the repeat list! Well done Carambola! :) our only complaint was that it is too far from home!"}
{"text":"This little gem of a bistro is tucked away in an unassuming strip mall. The food is really amazing and it was our favorite place during a recent trip to Hudson. My favorite tapas were the bacon wrapped figs, the carambola salad, and the scalloped potatoes. They do not serve alcohol, but you can BYOB. Be sure to make a reservation in advance on Fridays and Saturdays as it gets really busy. Ask to be seated near the window when you make your reservation because tables are really limited and more than half of them are too close to the kitchen for my taste. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I think the prices are a little steep. Not so unusual for Montreal, however."}
{"text":"We've heard rave reviews for a while now but have always opted against coming here since it is just so goddamn far. Luckily, we were in the area last Saturday and decided to drop by for lunch.   Best decision ever.   It's a byow, first of all. Usually I am not too impressed with byob's because the quality/price ratio tends to be pretty low, however Carambola is one of the few exceptions to the rule.   We devoured the braised beef Poutine with aged cheddar and the spicy fried chicken burger. The perfectly crispy hot chicken was served in a soft homemade pretzel bun. The Poutine was just out of this world. Everything was tasty, delicious and balanced.   Verdict: it's really worth the trip! Can't wait to come back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise  From the outside it doesn't look like much  But once inside WOW Very unique and wonderful menu The food was a symphony for the taste buds  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Quelle découverte! Le restaurant n'a pas l'air d'un truc trop pompeux le personnel est très chaleureux. Ensuite la bouffe, wow! Ça passe par les yeux et la présentation en premier. Tout est minutieusement monté, présenté. Et dès qu'on met en bouche, on voit que les ingrédients ont été choisis pour leur qualité. On va au Carambola pour une expérience culinaire et aussi pour partager un bon moment."}
{"text":"Creative cuisine, very tasty dishes and excellent service. The only reason it is not five stars is because the desserts don't match the excellence of the main dishes. They are basic and good, not great, everything else is."}
{"text":"My husband and stopped for lunch on the way back to Toronto from Quebec City. We both has the special tuna soft tacos for lunch. They we great!!!  We got a small soup-rutabaga & leeks, fantastic, small spinach salad then fries with two soft tacos. Perfect. We are foodies from California and this meal was great. Not too heavy, just right. Everything was very fresh. Too bad we don't live closer. A GEM in a small town. Fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Équipe super sympathique, beaux produits de saison et bien situé à Hudson. Soyez certain de prendre la focaccia briochée au fenouil. C'est vraiment bon! On y retourne pour sur!!"}
{"text":"Open concept kitchen, small venue, BYOW. Very interesting flavor pairings. I have eaten here many times and never been disappointed."}
