{"text":"Service killed this place for me.  
The server brought out a glass of water for me but the glass had food residue stuck on it -from the previous customer. I politely asked for a new one. He never apologized but seemed almost surprised that I asked for a replacement. I wish everything stopped here but unfortunately there is more to the story.  I got my new glass of water- with no apologies- this time it had a black unidentifiable object floating in the water. 
Maybe the server is use to drinking water out of dirty cups and foreign objects floating in it and I asked for too much.   That ruined my evening. To complete our wonderful experience my friend found a piece of hair in the rice.... 

This place is over priced for what you get too. I'm pretty sure I can get better food and service for half the price. 

I won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I'd like this place a LOT better if they weren't charging high street prices for ordinary Vietnamese food. The food is well made, and the wait time is reasonable, but you pay about $5-$20 more than you would for the same food at a different Vietnamese restaurant. Are the fancy rectangle IKEA plates they use for presentation worth the extra $$? IDK. The waitress hovering over us and asking us if we loved everything didn't help much either.

\"How's the food?\" - Waitress

\"It's good, thanks.\" - Me

\"But do you LOVE it? Hmmm?!\" - Waitress

Calgary does Vietnamese food very well, so there are countless other options that are easier on your wallet."}
{"text":"Colonial Fusion is classy, delicious and highly recommended.  This restaurant has only been open a few weeks, and it is not going to take long before it is busy, once Calgary discovers it!
