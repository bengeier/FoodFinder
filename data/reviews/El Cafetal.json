{"text":"Been here a few times. Sometimes the food is spot on and delicious and sometimes not so much. The apps are always good and so are the desserts. 
Main dishes especially the steak is always leather like and very hard to digest. Chicken, soups and breakfast items have always been tasty. We've been here a few times and enjoy most of our meals. As a non Spanish speaker we try different stuff and some of it might simply not be the flavor and preparation we're used to."}
{"text":"We love Sunday breakfast.  And, this place is on the list.  Nestled next to the Food Lion in Indian Trail, this place is warm and inviting.  Very clean--a must for me.  And the food was excellently prepared. Definitely on the list."}
{"text":"The beans are probably the best thing ever, along with the pork skin i could just eat those.

The food is all really good, i am not so much of a fan of their plantain but its ok. If you want a big platter of meat get the parrillada el cafetal."}
{"text":"Great Colombian Food! 
My husband is from Colombian so he's pretty picky about his Colombian food and he loves it! 
The waitresses are the sweetest people and the service is great! Can't beat the prices! And they have natural juices!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late breakfast. Excellent food and great service. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love the chicken Empanadas and the sauce that comes with it...overall the food is good...service could be better"}
{"text":"Give the people what they want!  This place gives the people want they want and more.  So much food and it just so happens to be great food too. The staff is friendly the place is small and unassuming, clean, and welcoming. The people cooking the arroz con pollo know what they are doing. The empanadas were good too. You must try the yucca frita since they make the 3 sauces that go with it and they are all good. I will be back soon ( maybe for breakfast)."}
{"text":"AWESOME COLOMBIAN FOOD !!! Had breakfast at El Cafetal, everything was delicious. I had perico with rice and My husband huevos, chicharron, chorizo, and arepas. The service was fast, friendly and everything clean and welcoming.  Can't wait to go back and try the Bandeja Paisa !!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Colombian food outside of Colombia. Went there today for the first time and had the Bandeja Paisa. This dish was phenomenally delicious. Chorizo was perfectly cooked and of high quality. Fried egg on top was an adorable touch. Rice and beans were yummo. Great service. This place is just plain great! I'll be going back again soon. Tomorrow. I'll be going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time as an alternative to La Unica. Food amazing! Service was excellent! We ordered yuca frita, empanadas, tostones and the entrana. Definitely my first choice of restaurants from here on out. Spread the word because we need this place to thrive. There are very few great Colombian restaurants and this is one."}
{"text":"Wasn't very pleased but there isn't much Colombian food around so I guess this will do."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice surprise!  My wife and I decided to give this a try, its right next to our dry cleaners and we always see people going in and out.  There is another really good Mexican restaurant nearby, and we were worried this was a spin off.  This was far from the case, El Cafetal has its own brand of Colombian food, it is creative and flavorful.  My wife had the salmon, she loved the distinct flavor, I had the barbecue plate which was tasty and filling (I could barely finish it!)  The service was good, my wife and I appreciated the attention we got from the servers, they answered all of our questions on the ingredients in the sauces, including the chimmichurri (sp?) which we really enjoyed.  We look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Service was good but the food was pretty bad. We got the empanadas and I'd be extremely surprised if these things weren't frozen before they fried them. The chicken empanada was flavorless and had nasty texture. The beef ones weren't so bad. Still not very good though. Our main entree was terrible. It was a rice dish with a combination of chicken, shrimp, steak, oysters & squid. My first impression was the smell and it just smelled old. Seafood that is not fresh has a very district smell and taste and this dish did not smell or taste good at all. The rest of the night, even after we went home, we still smelt it and it makes me nauseated just thinking about it. I hope we just ordered wrong or just caught them on a bad night because I really wanted to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, I mean EXCELLENT!  SERVICE LAST TIME WE ATE THERE WAS TERRIBLE!  We, a party of 5 walked in at 8:20 pm, ordered by  8:30,  and then a party of 10 walked in 10 minutes later,followed by another party of 2, followed by yet a another party of 2 and we still do not have our food 45 minutes later..I state to my family that I am waking out if we do not have our food in 10 minutes. So I set  my timer and my family and I got up, offered to pay for the drinks we ordered, they did not make us pay, and we left..     It's a shame for both parties because their food is phenomenal and we all like it and they just lost a lot of money since we eat there at least once a week and will be hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Arroz con pollo. Flavorful veggies. So delicious!  Great portion sizes, and the chicken was capital-T tender . Our hostess for the evening was so very considerate and gracious. 

The plantains served with our meal we're awesome - caremelizaton so that the edges were crispy, with sweet and fluffy center. Enough alone to warrant a return trip. 

The chimichurri served with our piping hot, crispy empanadas offered a cool and bright contrast. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We really liked it here, and the service is very friendly. Food was delicious, and it was plentiful. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Tried tonight for the first time.  Delicious!   Roast chicken was perfectly cooked.  Plantains and pintos were excellent sides.  Slice of in house made tres leches cake for dessert was incredible! We will definitely be going back!  Maybe next week."}
{"text":"Love this place! Really friendly and very professional, not to mention the food. It's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant.  The best flan I have ever had!! And the bandeja paisa is not to be missed.  I had lunch portion ---still huge.  I will definitely be back. :-)"}
{"text":"Very good!  Original! Plantain chips and dip upon arriving.  My husband and I both had a steak plate with beans, rice, plantains, sauces!  It was excellent.  A little pricey but we will be back.  Lunch specials during the week cost 5.99 and on weekends $7.99.  Service was very good.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with my nephew for lunch. We loved all of the food. The portions are HUGE! 
Amazing empanadas (chicken or beef).
Great service. Fresh food."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST Hispanic/Latino restaurant I've ever eaten at in the U.S., with the possible exception of Pollos Mario's. The menu is from top to bottom, amazing. The empanadas de carne o pollo, churrascco, & the Bandeja Paisa are to die for. If you are in N.C., and love Colombian cuisine, then I highly recommend this place. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and have eaten there several times. The food is so fresh. Me and my coworkers really like the food. The owners are super nice and eager to serve great-tasting meals. My favorite is the chimichanga lunch special. The guacamole tastes like it was made fresh. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is the first 5 star rating that I have ever given.  I tried this place for the first time last Friday and had the Churrasco which was terrific.  Forget about Columbian food, this place has great food no matter what ethnicity you call it!  Everything we were served was really fresh and hot.  They even have beers here, not a huge selection, but who cares the food is the real star.  The service is great and people in the restaurant all seemed to be happy eating good food :). I can't wait to go back, and oh ya, the place is super clean.  I like that!  Give this place a try, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This is the best Colombian food I have enjoyed since moving to NC. Great flavor, service is great, the juice is served frozen and delicious, and my churrasco was perfect, great fried plantains, great rice and beans, just GREAT! The Arepa de Chocolo con queso was awesome as well! You need to go here and just indulge yourself in awesomeness! No complaints, only compliments! Keep it up, Cafetal! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Colombians have told us that this food is the most authentic in the area.  We've been for breakfast, lunch & dinner - have been pleased every time."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find a gem like this hidden in Indian Trail. The meats were flavorful, the empanadas we had as an appetizer were excellent, the prices were reasonable and the service was friendly and fast. I will definitely be making this one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Super Super nice staff who helped us pick our meals and didn't steer us wrong! We tried 1 each of the empanadas and both were heavenly, especially with the added green sauce on the chicken.  We were so happy that almost everything is gluten free by nature and oh so good! Absolutely delicious flan!!!!!!! We don't live in the state, but if we did we would totally be back often! I have bookmarked this restaurant in case we are ever nearby again :-)"}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place for a long time and when I say that I mean 6 months!
The main reason was that I thought this place was way far from my house than it actually is. 
I have a Colombian friend that told me this was the best Colombian place in the city and since I LOVE Colombian food I had to check it out!
The service was outstanding! I have nothing bad to say about them, they were nice, attentive and fast!
We ordered a guayaba juice for me that was pretty good and a limeade for my husband. 
For appetizer we had beef empanadas and for entree we both went with the carne asada that originally comes with fried plantain but we asked them to switch it for fried yucca and they did it without additional charges. 
Food came with at the same time the empanadas did. One of the waiters apologized and seriously it was not big deal the main problem was the ceiling fan, our food got cold within few minutes :(
The food was good, we loved everything! The empanas were not my favorite today, they tasted good but the dough was too rough even though they were fried as per request.
Both sauces that came with the empanadas were good, chimichurri and another one that I don't know the name, the second one was real spicy but good!
Unfortunately they are too far away from us so I don't see us going back there any time soon. 
I believe they are worth the try, great service and good food."}
{"text":"I had brunch here a few days ago and I'm still dreaming about it. I had the arepas with beef which came with corn cake, guac, egg (I think), plantains and sour cream. DELICIOUS!
Updated: after several attempts to have dinner we finally managed to come in when they were open. The hours on Google are not accurate and sometimes they close early. We were greeted with  plantain chips and pink sauce which was  amazing and such a nice change from chips and salsa.  The waitress was an absolute sweetheart.  There's nothing better than  service from a truly friendly  person!  We both ordered the paison (steak, sausage, pork skin, egg, corn cake, avocado, AND plantains. ) I was stoked to be able to sub the rice and beans for salad - the salad was beautiful to boot! I asked for the pink sauce for my salad - so good! The meal was absolutely delicious and perfect. Much better value than any of these chain restaurants and way more authentic. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with my Gringo friend Adam B. The food is delicious, the service is great, and the location is perfect. The food brings me back when I was a little bon-bon and I enjoyed my moms cooking. I always go with the bandeja paisa and never leave disappointed. Also I wash down all that good food with a delicious postobon manzana."}
{"text":"Great Columbian food like my mother in law used to make, you will not be disappointed in anything you have there. From NJ and we are picky with our ethnic culinary spots, this place is very good!!"}
{"text":"Awesome colombian food in Indian trail! Ate some delicious steak asado. the empanadas were delicious and the service excellent. The people here are so kind and I am never disappointed.  The fried plantains are also amazing.  You won't regret eating here (if you have an open mind)."}
{"text":"El Cafetal is one of the best Spanish restaurants in town!! The prices and taste are definitely up to par, with other high quality restaurants in the area. I highly recommend the house special \"bandija\" (steak, sausage, chicharon, rice and beans, plantains, Sunnyside egg and arepa). Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Good  Colombian food. We recently moved here from Florida where we would get Colombian food all the time. The empanadas are a great appetizer accompanied with ham croquetas. The main course was a an awesome traditional Colombian dish with sausage, steak, egg, rice, chichirones , and plantains. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"There is very few options for Colombian food in charlotte area, this one is a very good option to try.  My server was not so good, but then another person took over, saving the day!  Good experience i will sure comeback and it s recommended for a good Colombian bite."}
{"text":"We chose to eat here when there was too long of a wait at La Unica, and I'm glad we did! The food was delicious, the staff was friendly- they answered all questions and helped us decide what to get. This place is a hidden gem! The tamale was HUGE and unlike anything I've ever had. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with their name, \"El Cafetal\" which means \"Coffee Plantation\". You'd think with a name like that they'd have a REAL coffee machine to make Café con Leche, Cafesito, Expresso which are available in EVERY Colombian bakery/restaurant, except this one. They have drip coffee which is blasphemous for a latin bakery/ restaurant! 

 Moving on to the complimentary platanitos (plantain chips)  which is also unusual for a Colombian restaurant as they would typically serve warm bread w/butter, except this restaurant. 

As we placed our order I asked for frijoles rojos (red beans) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I then asked for lentejas(lentils) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I even asked the server if they were sure they're a Colombian restaurant. 

 My Carne Asada Steak was extremely thin and lacking flavor, the rice was up to standard and the ONLY beans they offered were Pinto Beans which are typically available in Peruvian restaurants. 

The Churrasco (Sirloin Steak) wasn't bad and actually had some seasoning. The maduros were ripe and good, but you cannot be a REAL Colombian restaurant and not have RED BEANS or LENTILS! 

They are definitely not AUTHENTIC COLOMBIANS!"}
{"text":"A wonderful new find in Clipper Magazine. El Cafetal in Indian Trail is delicious. Very nice inside and a delightful staff. Find their coupons and deal on Local Flavor. Make sure you don't leave until you try dessert!"}
{"text":"Something completely new to us so not sure what to expect. I have to say it was good but a bit on the meaty side. If you're looking for a well balanced meal you may want to hit the La Unica. Seeing how I have no idea what to order I asked the young lady to help me out and she did very much so. The problem, not hers or mine, the language barrier. Once we hit in the same page I was happy with my choices and will return."}
{"text":"Awesome food, and a lot of it.  Our family of 3 ate for $30, and had enough leftovers for another meal.  The empanadas were great; perhaps the best I've had in a long time.  I also liked the chicken and rice, as well as the platter (wish I could remember the name).

Service was great; the only weak spot was the paella, which my brother-in-law ordered.  It just didn't taste fresh, but overall, the menu was great,  We'll be back."}
{"text":"With La Unica nearby, I thought this place didn't stand a chance. I was wrong; El Cafetal stands alone and is more even more delightful than I could have anticipated. 

The decor is modest, and it can get loud in here with nothing to damper the sound of plates and chatter. The food, though, is excellent. The plantains alone are worth the trip. I mean it; order extra plantains. 

Prices are reasonable and portions are substantial. So glad we gave this place a try."}
{"text":"Great spot tucked away in the Food Lion shopping center off Old Monroe Rd.  They have solid authentic Colombian food.  

For lunch i got a half roasted chicken, rice, beans and fried Plantains for $6.50!  

I really liked the green sauce they brought with the entree.  It mixed well with the rice and chicken.

For dessert, they have really good Tres Leches...."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Consistent taste. Reasonable prices. Great service. This food got me through my second pregnancy, can't say enough about it. Try it!"}
{"text":"I intended on going to LaUnica,  but wasn't thrilled with the food the last time. I saw this cute little Columbian place in the same parking lot and thought I would give it a try. Glad I did!  The food was fresh,  authentic, and the staff were all very pleasant.  I tried the Empanads,  and they were a nice spin on the kind I'm used to. Made with corn cake instead of the customary pastry shells or tortillas. Very good!  I'll definitely be back to try more items.  Great place to go if you want \"home cooked\" Columbian food.  Just what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic! My wife and I have eaten here more times than we can count. We have never had a bad experience. There is zero turnover among employees. The customer service and friendliness is also 5 Star. 
  Make sure to get an empanada and an arepa de chocolo. The fried shrimp are butterflied and fried perfect, be sure to get the pink sauce to dip them in. Mmmm. The chimichuri  and aji are made fresh everyday.  Tres leeches is the best we've had. Paired with a fresh Colombian coffee, wow."}
{"text":"Loved it! Sat at one of the 4 tables out in front of the store-front restaurant. We had a view of to parking lot but that didn't hinder our enjoyment of the crispy comp. plantains and dipping sauces. 

The wait staff was great and the menu is full of local Columbian favorites. There also was a lunch menu with 6 different entrees for $5.99 each. My husband ordered off the regular menu and I had the rotisserie chicken, rice, & beans from the special $5.99 menu. Large portion's and was delicious. 

The dress is casual and I noted they are open for breakfast too. We will try that for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife 7 year old and 2 year old.  Wow.  Food was excellent and so was the service.  The kids loved the fried plantain, they serve each table.  My wife had Mojarra, I had the first Carne dish on the menu and the kids spilt an arrizo con pollo.  The waitress was extremely friendly, especially with the kids.  Price was right too.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Came here with my GF for the first time, was pleasantly surprised.  We love Mexican food so we figured Colombian food was probably similar.  It's different, but in a good way.  Most dishes seem to come with savory (not sweet) baked beans (not refried), white rice, and fried plantains...which is odd to me except the beans are amazing tasting and I seem to like fried plantains more than I thought. I had the plate that comes additionally with a corn cake, sausage link, fried egg, piece of flat steak, and piece of avocado.  Everything was tasty, we had some leftover chimichurri from the appetizer empanadas (best I've ever had btw).  The chimichurri went well on everything.

Anyhow, the staff was very nice and the food was awesome, but very filling.  Will be back for sure.  Definitely a nice change from La Unica which is in the same plaza.  I wish more people tired this place because something this unique deserves to stay in business.  Try it if you are on the fence."}
{"text":"Woo that amazing place for breakfast, lunch... 
For start before u order, fried plantains.. 
Attention very fast, an the food is great... Omg I love this place"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now & never had anything bad, including the service.   I've been sticking with the chicken & skirt steak.  The family had the sausage & burgers & everyone was pleased with their orders."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff that has helped us find items that we enjoy. Very good for lunch & dinner, but don't sleep on this place for breakfast/brunch. Being a Colombian restaurant the breakfast won't be traditional american food, but it will be very good!! And the coffee...come on how do you beat Colombian coffee! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Colombian  restaurants I've been to. The food is authentic and doesn't seem to be any different from my grandmother's food (who is from Colombia). I never am disappointed with the Entrana which seems to be a worthy competitor to the Bandeja Paisia. Will visit time and time again."}
{"text":"The family & I REALLY enjoyed the family friendly atmosphere ...we felt very welcomed...GREAT all around wait staff! Efficient, attentive and prompt...what more can one ask for!? 

The food did not disappoint, the prices are very reasonable and to boot the portions were generous.

The \"bandeja paisa\" was tasty & would order again, the ONLY thing I would do differently is to request my egg to be cooked sunny side up, opposed to an over done yolk. 
The beans were delicious ...as was their chicken soup, nice amount of chicken & veggies the broth was perfect! 
I m not one for arepas but according to my picky Columbian father they were not bad. He also loved their morcilla, I am not one for blood anything so needless to say I past. 

Dessert: 
Las brevas (figs) were TDF they really were pretty special, not rich at all just sweet enough. 
The Arequipe (dulce de leche) was phenomenal ...I suggest just a slight dab with each bite of a fig, that way it's a perfect balance of sweet. 

Saved the BEST for LAST! 
The Lolu is a MUST, do yourself a favor & don't MISS OUT on this beverage, you will NEVER encounter a more unique & rare wild fruit beverage again!!! It taste like a combo of kiwi, orange & maracuyá (passion fruit). VERY refreshing (light) hence easy to drink! 
I loved it SO MUCH I ordered a couple bottles via Amazon. 

Buen provecho"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try, based on the prior highly rated reviews. Had a bad first impression so we will not be coming back. I came here to order takeout so I could take the food home to enjoy with my husband who was home with the kids. First, upon entering the restaurant, no one glanced up to greet me. Mind you, there is an open window into the kitchen that is visible to the front door. The kitchen staff was talking with the wait staff when I entered the door, so I gave them a few minutes, giving them the benefit of the doubt, saying to myself that they \"must be busy\". Still nothing. I went to grab a menu off of the wall (which was next to the window) to garner some attention. Nothing. Finally, I was able to grab the attention of a gentleman who came out of the kitchen--I asked if I could order takeout, and he answered yes, but he acted like I was wasting his time. I informed him that I was ready to order, and he was surprised. Sorry, Sir, I was there long enough to decide on which items to order. As I was ordering, he corrected me in my pronunciation of the names of the dishes, having me repeat the words in the correct accent. He finished taking my order and gave me the receipt to sign/pay, and just stood here. Granted, it was my prerogative whether or not to add a tip to the total. I will say that I am not known to give a tip if I order takeout. However, I felt pressured to do so, as he stood there and watched me sign the receipt. I did add a tip, and justified doing so (to myself) because this was a local restaurant (i.e. not a chain)/small business. He took the receipt without saying anything. I asked how long the wait would be; he answered \"about 15 minutes\". I then tried to start up a friendly conversation with him, he obliged and we spoke briefly for a couple of minutes. I then asked him what the breads were next to the front counter, as I intended to purchase some to try. He said something about bread with cheese, and proceeded to hand me a napkin. I was confused and asked \"you want me to try it?\" He nodded and I picked up a \"roll\" to eat and asked if these rolls were given out for patrons who dine in, and he answered yes. He then walked away, stating that he needed to \"go make some more\", leaving my itemized receipt on the counter, so I picked it up. I had ordered two empanadas (one chicken, one beef), one Arepa de Chocolo con queso, one Arepa con queso, one Milanesa de Pollo, one Entrana, and one order of Flan. All, including tip, cost under $50. As I was waiting for my order to be ready, I tried that roll. That roll was really good, crispy/crusty on the outside and was cheesy/doughy on the inside.  They had a couple of tables of patrons who were dining in. The lady who was waiting on the dine-in tables was also responsible for getting my order ready. She asked if I had the Milanesa, I answered yes. She proceeded to place a container in a bag and then set it down in front of me, implying that my food was ready to go. I asked her if everything was in there? She said \"you said you had the Milanesa\"....right, but I had some other items that I ordered as well. I grabbed the itemized receipt and showed her. She said \"you should've given this to me so I knew what you ordered.\" I'm sorry, what? How was I supposed to know you had nothing to go off of, other than the itemized receipt that the gentleman had left on the counter? She grabbed the rest of my order and I asked her if it was possible for me to grab another one of the \"rolls\" so I could take it home for my husband to try. She started to put one roll with a pair of tongs into a small paper bag and casually asked \"you paid for it already, right?\" Being honest, I said \"no, the gentleman let me try one and it was really good, so I was wondering if I could take one home for my husband to try as well.\" She hesitated, glanced through the window into the open kitchen, and I pointed out to her the gentleman who took my order. She said \"let me ask him, he's the owner\". I smirked but said okay. She walked up to the window and talked to him loudly across the kitchen, then grabbed a bowl of soup to take to a table. As she passed by me, she said \"he'll be right out\". At this point, I'm thinking 'All I'm asking for is one roll that you would have given me if I had dined in'. The lady walked back from delivering the bowl of soup,went into the kitchen and had a quiet conversation with the gentleman, who I now knew as the owner. She then came out and told me \"It'll be a dollar.\" Excuse me? I ordered two entrees plus 4 orders of appetizers and a dessert. She then put a roll into a bag without asking if I wanted one and told me to add $1 to the receipt I already signed. I was peeved. Besides the overpriced roll that they begrudgingly gave me, their food was bland. Portions were small and no sauce accompanied the Milanesa. The chimichurri was bitter as there was no acidity to it and wasn't fresh. Poor food and even worse service--don't waste your $ or time"}
{"text":"This place is very good!  I am from Colombia and this is a little taste of home.  I really like spending a Sunday afternoon for a nice sit down meal."}
