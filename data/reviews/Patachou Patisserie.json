{"text":"Oh yeah. If you like french bakeries this is the place to go!!!

Love the croissants and pretty much everything else too. Prices are ok for the quality you get. 

Great for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the supreme chicken with orange juice and it was delicious. The creme caramel with double espresso made my hectic day."}
{"text":"Back when I moved to Toronto the first time, Patachou was the only lace in the city where you could get a Cafe Latte in a bowl.

Parisian right down the line, from the fresh baked breads, to the snobby attitude, this is as close as you'll get.

It's remained similar over the years, which is nice. Don't fix it if it ain't broken right? They make great food for take away or sit down and they have a lovely patio. Simple, elegant, quality.

It boarders Rosedale on Yonge, so expect purse dogs and overly perfumed old ladies-just get the take away and call it a day."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around lunch for a light lunch. We ordered the prosciutto sandwich - with arugula, onion confit and cheese (I believe this was around $7-8). It came pressed and was prepared to order. There were thick slices of prosciutto in it, and the combination of it with the onion confit and cheese was to die for. A fantastic sandwich - highly recommended!

We also ordered a pain au chocolat, which was extremely disappointing. It was stale and not at all buttery/flakey. My boyfriend said it must've been an off-day since he's had them before and they're normally a lot better. Maybe I'll give this another shot next time.

They have a large display of pastries and desserts, which looked really good! Last time I was here, I tried the apple tart, which was really nice. We also had the capuccino eclair which was just decent. 

Overall, Patachou is pretty solid - minus the stale pain au chocolat I had!"}
{"text":"Based on the location, my hopes weren't high, but I have to thank the random twists of multiculturalism for somehow putting an excellent French bakery in the middle of nowhere on St Clair.

They have a good selection of treats as well as a few food items, and everything I have tried has been great, though I shouldn't reveal my favourite thing because I hate it when they're sold out.

It's a little pricy but I'm not complaining; the food is made with love and it's one of the best things I've found on St Clair so far (and one of the best bakeries I've tried in Toronto)."}
{"text":"fresh-squeezed cranberry juice is amazing.  yet to find anything like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL!!!
I ordered by son's birthday cake from here and was quoted $80, however when I went to collect it had changed to $110. I was told that the manger had left a message with the price increase....that would have been fine if I actually had voice mail on my phone!!! Beware of the awful service and underhand tactics of the bakery to extort money from innocent loving parents!!  I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS BOURGEOIS BAKERY AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Cute little patisserie just North of Rosedale station with very well priced, decent tasting macarons. At $1.50/macaron it's a steal!

They've got only six flavours, if I remember correctly and they are: chocolate, vanilla, caramel, lime, pistachio, and mocha.

Little tip, if you're looking to buy a dozen macarons, you should get them in a cardboard box rather than in the clear plastic prepackaged boxes then it comes to an even $20 for a dozen, as opposed to $18, which gives you enough money for one more macaron! 

Definitely a great place to buy macarons if you've never had them before and want to try a whole bunch without spending a lot of money."}
{"text":"A nice bakery and a good spot to go if you want a simple but leisurely breakfast.  I went after 9 am so although busy, it wasn't an issue to stay for awhile and read the paper.   There is also outdoor seating now, so you can enjoy the patio if you prefer.

I've been there a few times before and the food has always been pretty good.  Tasty croissants, and fresh bread.  Their pastries and cakes are fine, but not artful enough as French bakeries go to earn a higher star rating."}
{"text":"I went there for macarons, and it was my lucky day!  I was served by the owner, I think.  She was an older (and very French) woman, who everyone called \"Madame\".  There were also younger staff present, but \"Madame\" came over to help me.  I told her I was there to eat macarons! And she was very friendly, attentive, and generous!  She described all the flavours to me, and I asked for one of each.  She then proceeded to give me triple of each!!  And she told the cashier girl to ring up only the amount I asked for (which was 6 macarons).  I ended up with a hefty little brown paper sack of macarons.  God bless her for feeding my greedy soul.  

Each macaron is slightly larger than a toonie.  Flavours the day I went were: Raspberry, Chocolate, Coffee, Pistachio, Lemon, and Vanilla.  The flavours were done nicely.  I always love seeing black vanilla seeds in an authentic Vanilla.  Pistachio contained finely ground nuts, yummy.  Something funny happened when I bit into the Lemon; my teeth hit something plastic-like, and I was like, WTF?!  I pulled the tiny piece out of my mouth and found it was a piece of actual lemon zest (aka peel)!  So after a sigh of relief (and pleasure), I give Patachou two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Patachou is a bustling high energy pastry shop/cafe. There's nothing idyllic or relaxing about the space, but the pastry can take you away to a wonderful dreamy place in your head if that's what you're looking for. The service is attentive and responsive, and on the whole, the experience is not unpleasant.

Why they didn't get 5 stars:
* While attentive and responsive, the service is also a bit clumsy.
* While the pastry is delectable and worth returning for, the other offerings (especially the soups) aren't at the same level which results in a less than perfect experience.
* Tables are tightly spaced at best, making it a little bit difficult to enter/exit without jostling other diners.
* While free refills on the coffee is nice, it's be nicer if the coffee was better.

It's worth stopping in to pick up something crisp, tender and buttery, but I wouldn't stay."}
{"text":"Went back for another shot because I'm objective enough to give a place another try even though the macarons were too chewy and old the last time.

This time, I thought I'd try their mushroom and leek quiche.

After their odd request to decant my Starbucks cup into an unmarked one of their own, I sat down to try out this quiche.

Yuck.

ICK.

Here are all the reasons why what I ate was pretty disgusting:

1. Under-seasoned. I had to actually ask for some salt and pepper (and no I am not someone who is addicted to salt, in fact I actively cut DOWN on my salt intake).

I usually find everything too salty, so it surprised me at how crappy and bland it was.

2. It tasted like they used eggs from a carton, or had too much cream, or SOMETHING.  But it had the texture of scrambled white tofu which is appalling.

OR maybe it was just made with egg whites to save money or in an effort to be healthier. Who knows? It was just gross.

3. Mushroms and leeks? No flavour there, but that wasn't a big surprise for me because with those quiches you normally have to eat them hot out of the oven or else they lose their flavour and texture.

4. They charged me $6.75 for it when the sign on the board said $5.50

It's a pity because the pastry itself which is normally the hardest part, was really well made. I mean that butter pastry was perfection. The filling, not so much.

When I was asked about how my quiche was, I told her the truth (because I'm honest), and told her it was not a 'quiche'. She didn't let me explain that it had all the so-called ingredients of a good quiche, but it was not made properly or the ingredients themselves were the problem, namely the lack of a good solid eggy flavour.

She had the balls to tell me that in 35 years, I was the first customer to have told her that.

Really? 

As someone who has been to Paris many times, eaten plenty of amazing quiches there, and MADE SOME OF HER OWN, I can tell you that what I make at home (from scratch with butter cubes and everything), is better than what I ate today for $6.75 (rip off!!).

Then again, maybe they were just too polite to say anything, as most Canadians are (not me).

Or even worse, these poor souls have never had a real quiche in their LIVES.

A boulangerie I know in Montreal that is in the underground of Complexe Desjardins makes an EXCELLENT quiche that is the real stuff. 

Then again, the guy working the place is a real baker from Belgium, so he knows what goes into a quiche.

Torontonians I'm afraid, still have yet to measure up to the minimum quality of French-style food in Montreal.

She kept arguing with me that \"that's what a quiche is, those are the ingredients that have to go into one\".

Pardon me, but I didn't feel like getting into a screaming match with someone over how horrible I thought their food was, so I let it slide.

Don't ask if you don't want the truth. If you want me to lie, then don't ask me how I thought the quiche tasted, because I don't hold back.

You can be certain I will never return to their establishment again.

(Something i am sure they are thrilled about.)

And I will not recommend this place to anyone I know.

(Something they might be less thrilled about.)

There you have it. The worst quiche in Toronto, folks. Stay well away.

Their desserts are probably better. 

At least their macarons are edible if you can't get to Montreal or Paris."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I could see myself being a regular at if I lived in the area. Great French pastry (the almond chocolate croissant was particularly outstanding), nice neighborhood feel to the area, and the only Patisserie so far I've been in that has decent dining space. 

One deterrent would be my one long straight frickin drive from Richmond hill along Yonge St., though I can't let that cloud my judgment. This place is easily up there with the best patisseries in GTA."}
{"text":"I came in for Macaron Day right after work. I've been here once many moons ago to try their $1 macaron.  It's $1.75 now - my how time flies and prices sky rocket - it's still the same size (like a quarter), a bit chewy but good flavour as I remember.

Also had:
- opera cake
meh, not too flavourful
- salted caramel tart
OMG... So Good! Very rich... I could only do a few bites tho.
- croissant
nice and flaky, bought a few extra to freeze and reheat at home

Service is with a smile and quick. They also have quite a few seating and serve other savoury food, gonna have to try those sometime."}
{"text":"This a nice restaurant. It has great food, good service and a very pleasant atmosphere. On cool summer days, one can sit outside with friends and watch the world go by on Yonge.  It's a great place. You should check it out if you can."}
{"text":"5-star croissant (best pain au chocolat in GTA!)

2-star macarons (maybe it was their \"off\" day or days when I tried, the shells were a bit too gluey and dense in the middle, fillings are nicely flavoured but could be less sweet and more ganache consistency vs. the butter cream kind they put in).  

Excellent service, friendly staff, a cool vibe.  I'd be happy to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, however since I'm a creature of habit I have only had the coffee and plain croissant which I know comes out to $3.43. The croissant is somewhere between the ridiculously buttery and flaky types and the straight-up biscuits shaped as croissants. Therefore, it's a nice balance that tastes great, but you don't feel like you're going to suffer a heart attack after eating it. Coffee aint' bad either.

One day I will have to come here for a full lunch though and sample one of their delicious looking salads or sandwiches. Might upgrade to 5 stars after doing so.

The ambiance is indeed very French with an array of baked goods at the front window enticing you to come in, soft accordion music, and a mid-sized open seating area with the usual Rosedale crowd. I have had two incidents where chi-chi elderly women have attempted to cut me in line but I stand my ground. Not the restaurants fault though, fortunately the staff are always cheery and accommodating."}
{"text":"Patachou is always busy. Hugging the corner of Macperhson and Yonge it's a hot spot for watching the busy Rosedale inhabitants shuffle between antique stores, speciality shops and other up town errands. Plenty of light fills their restaurant and the constant come and go of the customers creates an easing eb and flow to the restaurant vibe. I like the vibe of the restaurant but I've never been blown away by their food. 

The few times I have eaten at Patachou have been at lunch, which could explain why it's perpetually been my fourth choice during my lunch break. There's not many options in Rosedale for lunch so Patachou gets jammed pack. They've usually run out of what I want by the time I've gotten there and last time I was there I found a hair in my sandwich. I could only imagine the atrocities if the couple sitting in front of me had found that same hair. DONT FRET! I don't think the 'hair-thing' is a common occurrence for them. Patachou serves a variety of sandwiches, a few soups (and soup of the day), some larger entree options and they have daily fresh made salads at the front counter you can order in or to go. I'd be careful if you're taking to go, the price can escalate real quick. They also have a shelf filled with patisserie, oozing with charm, begging to be eaten.

PLUS - They give you a basket of bread when you arrive for eating in. French baguette, for the most part, fresh. Oh, how I miss Paris.

As you probably already know about the Rosedale area, everything is over priced - comes with the territory. I usually don't mind this, but get a little irritated when I'm spending $8-$10 on a sub par sandwich, which doesn't even come with a side salad. I won't be rushing into Patachou any time soon for lunch but I will probably jump in when I'm craving a croissant or pain au chocolat. I don't know how I haven't tried one yet - from all of the reviewers it sounds like it's a must. I'll report once I've done the deed.

Overall, I give a 3 star rating. Service is friendly, atmosphere is light and inviting and the food is fine but not great."}
{"text":"Cute place that I drive by often so I decided to park my car and drop in. When I walked in, it was almost time to close so I didn't sit down. Instead, I skimmed the entire place to get a feel of it. It's a place to sit, enjoy a cafe au lait whilst having a sweet or savoury treat.

A colleague helped me out and as a 'thank you' was going to go to the LCBO to buy a bottle of wine. However, decided to buy her some treats from Patachou instead. I bought a box of six various almond treats. 

Can't wait to come back to check out other food items here."}
{"text":"Had one of each macaron they had, except for lemon.  I don't think they were very fresh, but it had a chewy consistency and an okay filling.  We took it to go, and the buttercream was melting slightly even though we were only walking around the Eaton Centre.  Service could've been better, they initially ignored us for the first few minutes, probably not used to having young adults at their cafe...age discrimination?  They also didn't offer us bags and the lady at the cash kept staring at me strangely for unknown reasons.  Additionally, my friend's macarons split...not the best quality.  It was also a bit pricey, at $1.95 each.  Came here because Nadege across the street was closed on Monday.
We also found the displays lacking, prices were not shown and the macaron flavours were not labelled either."}
{"text":"I never cared for macaroons till I tried LaBamboche which got me hooked on them so I figured I should explore other places and see what else is out there. I read so many glowing reviews about Patachou that I ventured over for a sampling. Well, I wasn't impressed. The macaroons are loaded with sugar and coloring. While this is a dream for the taste buds of a 4 year old, they are just too much for my twenty somethings taste buds. No thank you."}
{"text":"If you want the best selection at this patisserie, make sure you get there early. I went around 5 pm on a weekday and a lot of stuff are sold out so I can't really comment about their selection since there wasn't much to choose from. I got me some macaroons here. It was alright. Has a cakey texture inside if that's to your liking. The taste was a bit weak though. Chocolate one could definitely use more chocolate / cocoa!"}
{"text":"Went here today because I had walked by it before and it looked so damn cute. What seems to me to be a very european style cafe, I throughly enjoyed my Szechwan chicken pressed sandwich. The broccoli soup was so so, but I saw some french onion and was drooling. They have a bunch of fresh baked breads and a ready made \"to go\" cooler. You can also order stuff to go. However, they also have sit down service and the outdoor patio looked very inviting on a cool summer day. Nice music playing in the background gave great ambiance and the dessert/pastry case looked delicious. I'll be going back for a more in-depth look.

**One new note....I'm 24 and the average age of most people here was between 50-60....but I don't care. It was still neat."}
{"text":"The croissants ($1.85) at Patachou really are excellent. Flaky crust, moist inside, buttery, and great flavour. Probably the best I've had in Toronto. If I stopped eating here, and I wish I did, I'd be giving Patachou 5 stars.

The Lemon Tart ($5.25), my yard stick for French patisseries, was disappointingly very weak. The crust was decent, but the lemon curd filling just wasn't doing it for me. I still have a bad aftertaste in my mouth 20 minutes after eating the tart. For this price I expect much better.

To finish the review on a positive note, the Lemon Macaron ($1) was great. The meringue had a crispy shell and light interior and the lemon filling was creamy and delicious.

Stick to the croissants and you'll walk away happy."}
{"text":"VIBE 
If you want a slice of Paris, this is the place to go. I'm not even joking when I say a few of the patrons here were speaking French. It's a great little patisserie and the perfect place to bring your mom or a girlfriend for lunch. I was here two days before Christmas so it was a little nutty, but still quite relaxed. 

A note on the service: I pretty much had to flag down my waitress or get one of her colleagues to assist me for well, anything. Also, service is not slamming down my plate on the table. 

Lovely surprise: the hooks on the high tops for your purse. Perfect! 

I ATE
The french onion soup. Lovely. Needed a tad more salt but otherwise, great. A complimentary basket of baguette comes with the meal and it is DELISH. 

I was starving so I ordered the prosciutto panini with fig and chevre (I think). Unfortunately, the sandwich was burnt and tasted burnt. It just didn't feel pressed but I couldn't flag down my waitress. When I told her colleague, she said \"you should have told us earlier.\" So yeah, a bit of an issue there. Unfortunately, I won't have a sandwich here again. 

But I will come back and try some of their other dishes including the delectable desserts that were sitting in their display case waiting to be eaten. 

This also seems like a great place for a cafe au lait or steaming mug of hot cocoa and a macaron. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
It's nice when you get service with a smile but maybe they're learning from their French ancestors? I don't know. The most hilarious part is that none of the kitchen staff are actually from France and are from Asia! (The owner is French though). 

It's nice to have un petit part of Paris in Rosedale, however."}
{"text":"When I lived around Rosedale, I would walk past this place and see the patisseries in the window. I once upon a time had a big affinity for pain au chocolats. For those who are unfamiliar with this pastry, it's made of the same pastry that a croissant is made of but it is usually baked into a rectangle shape. Inside the pastry you should find one thick rod (sometimes two) of bittersweet/semisweet chocolate. 

I have a pretty high standard for a pain au chocolat since I would eat one almost every morning on my way to school as an exchange student in France. Patachou really impressed. They were the right flaky/crispness on the outer layer while still soft inside. They had the right amount of butter flavour and the chocolate was well done. I don't remember the exact price but I remember it's reasonably well priced. 

Always, like at any patisserie, go in the morning when they make everything and before it gets sold out."}
{"text":"Patachou Patisserie is just North of Rosedale Subway Station.. and I always enjoy strolling around the neighbourhood with all these small businesses.

Marcaon Day led me to Patachou Patisserie, but sadly they said all the free ones are gone... if I want one, I can buy one. With just a handful of them left, they don't look too appetitizing. I apted for 

Orange Almond Tart ($5.25)
- The tart itself is quite good... the outshell is ultra buttery... 
-  I wish the almond flavour can be a little stronger

The staff that served me was a little confused though...she was not really sure about what pastries they have and even the prices... though my pastry was boxed nicely to go..

Patachou's baked goods are quite good, doesn't make me go Wow... but just everything feel so unorganized..... maybe it is one of the charm of a French Patisserie?"}
{"text":"The croissant... 3.5... sort of a smaller pastry and disappointingly deflated presentation.  Nice crispness and butteriness though.  Tried it late in the afternoon so the morning may yield a better product.   But it is NOT among the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this bakery on my way to an appointment, and even though I was running 20 minutes late I couldn't help but be lured inside by the aroma of 10 metric tonnes of butter being churned and made into glistening pastries shortly en route to my stomach. Almond croissants, chocolate (\"pain au chocolat\"), plain and many other baked delights await here. My chocolate croissant was decidedly the best of its kind I've sampled in Toronto.

I'd been warned of the unwelcoming (French) service so I knew to expect it: the two girls at the cash were more interested in talking to each other than ringing in my $2 purchase. Justin Bieber is like soooo cute, hey."}
{"text":"I went to Patachou yesterday and it was alright. It was surprisingly busy but I guess it was around 1pm so that can explain the crowd. 

I didn't have any of the baked goods but they all looked amazing! Next time I'm there I'll have to try one. However, one of the people who I was with had a brioche, which is basically a rich in egg and butter bread with a flaky crust. It apparently was amazing, and she gets it all the time so even though I haven't had it I'm going to recommend it. Me and the rest of the group opted to have salads; the house, spinach and Greek to be exact. They were all great, but the Greek salad was VERY oily. So if you do order a salad ask for the dressing on the side. 

We sat on the patio and it was still a little chilly for that because the sun wasn't hitting it and there's a roof top with metal chairs. *Note if it's still a bit on the cooler side and you're not wearing a long jacket your butt/back of your thighs will get super cold if you're not sitting on the wooden \"booth\" side. 

The service was pretty good seeing as they were busy. Everything was priced well.. all together (there were 5 of us) it was $65 or so, tip included. 

Just a side note for the restaurant if they ever read this...if you're going to serve lemon water you should garnish the glass with some lemon so it doesn't look like there is mysterious things floating in the water."}
