{"text":"Amazing Sinhalese-style food. I ordered the lamprais - so tasty, great value, and wonderful service. When I told her that my oven wasn't working properly, she gave in-depth tips on other ways to heat the food properly. A really pleasant (and delicious) surprise!"}
{"text":"I came here in search of Sinhalese food and was not disappointed. The owners are from southern Sri Lanka and had dishes made from many of the same vegetables I remember from my time in Kandy which I have had a hard time finding elsewhere such as ash plantain (aka ash banana), bread fruit, both kinds of jack fruit, plus at least a dozen other vegetables such as okra, green beans, pumpkin, cabbage, and eggplant.

You can get six veggie curries with rice for $8 or $9. The curries are coconut milk based and have a different spice profile than Indian or Thai food.

The veggie dishes were excellent and the coconut roti was to die for. When I asked if they had pol roti (coconut roti) the owner asked me how I knew about it. I told him about my time in Sri Lanka and then he brought us extra dishes to try, like eggplant pickles.

This place also boasts the only authentic lamprais but I don't eat meat, so I can't tell you about that.

The owners are great, the prices are more than fair, and the food is delicious. 

This is primarily a take out joint but there are two tables.  Also, it's a bakery so you can enjoy your meal surrounded by models of wedding cakes and ornate birthday cakes."}
{"text":"This place produces authentic Sinhalese food (as opposed to most other Sri Lankan restos that serveTamil food). The Lamprais are the BEST in the city and contain the most authentic curries. Most others slap curries in a bannana leaaf and work on the quantity rather than quality principle. The hot table selection is usually excellent and the $40 family meal deal is outstanding. I cant recommend this place enough.
Great work guys. Note: it is mainly a takeout spot with only a couple of tables but well worth the trip to Scarberia"}
{"text":"Best sri lankan food around. Had the cutlets, veggie rolls and pol rotti.

Next time I am in Markham I will try the lamprice and Kottu!"}
{"text":"I found this place while in Scarborough after speaking to a Sri Lankan coworker about where I could find some great Sinhalese-style food. The recommendation did not disappoint! Touch Down Foods is a family-owned business located just off Tapscott Road in an commercial area where I would not have expected to find a restaurant. Upon entering, I was happy to see a clean, fresh feeling environment. I find that typically many South-Asian restaurants have a generally stuffy feel with a very strong smell of cooking in the air. This place smelled inviting but it was not overpoweringly strong. They offer a variety of different hot (temperature-wise) dishes of both the meat (beef, chicken, pork, and mutton) variety as well as different vegetarian items. I opted for the staple Sri Lankan \"Kottu Roti\" which consists of roti and vegetable/meat curries which is chopped on a flat griddle. Additionally, I tried the Pol Roti (a roti made with coconut and chili) which comes with an onion chutney. Both dishes were made-to-order and tasted excellent. The onion chutney in addition to the chili peppers in the pol roti made for a very spicy experience for sure! My kottu was nicely spiced as well (though not very spicy) and had a good mix of meat (mutton) and vegetables in addition to the obvious roti pieces. Their prices are good for the quality/freshness of the food and the lady at the front (the owner) was very happy to chat with me about my interest in Sri Lankan food. While this place is quite far away, I see myself returning for take-out when I'm in the area again. Touch Down Foods also makes desserts (cakes and Sri Lankan style items) on-site. While I was there, another customer had come in to buy one of their cakes and highly recommended the desserts."}
