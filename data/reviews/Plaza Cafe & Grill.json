{"text":"Unbelievably nice and yummy cafe restaurant!!!

It is right next door to the IRS Service center. 

I had ordered tacos and my daughter ordered steak teriyaki.  They were under $10 for both menu and we had more than a half the teriyaki dish left over. So much food and they are so yummy that I took the rest home.

High quality food for unbelievably good price!

I watched other people ordering and eating, I definitely have to go back to try other menu item.

This place is far better than those national franchised fast food places.

This should be a must go and eat place!!!

I give 2 BIG thumbs up for this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! Exceptionally reasonable prices. Super nice and accommodating staff. Been here 5 or 6 times, zero complaints."}
{"text":"My favorite spot when I'm in the area for a casual lunch.  Super friendly staff and the quality of food is excellent!"}
{"text":"A great, tasty and affordable option for breakfast or lunch. So many things on the menu that I love. Top 5 items: breakfast veggie burrito, Greek wrap, chicken club sandwich, turkey melt, and Greek salad. These are my go to and are always on point. Also their salsa is delicious.  Not really spicy, but full of flavor! The staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First time here today! I could tell immediately when it was packed that it was going to be great food - it was super popular! 

The menu is easy to read and pretty simple. I was with a group and heard multiple times that everyone loved everything they'd had prior! 

I ordered the croissant with a few substitutes and it was great. Croissant was flaky and yummy, and the sandwich insides were awesome. I ordered chips for the side but they never came out + I was too hungry to wait in line again to ask for them. Haha. The friends I went with got fries and they looked amaaaaazing. I'll have to try those next time! 

I'm docking this one star for the missing chips and for a chair at the table that lost a screw while a friend was sitting in it! It's worth noting though that management was notified about the chair and set it aside to be fixed, as soon as we told them. :) 

They have tons of lemonades, teas, and a soda fountain too. Great beverage selection!"}
{"text":"I used to visit the cafe across the street from work but it recently closed, which is how I discovered this place. The owner, or manager is great and actually offers a discount since we walk across central ave to get there. I got a breakfast quesadilla and an order or strawberries and cream. I was not expecting the quesadilla to be so big, but wow was it good! It actually came with salsa and hash browns on the side, so it can definitely be split with a friend."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast spot in Central Avenue . They are very courteous and treat you like family . I go there everyday"}
{"text":"From breakfast burritos to the daily lunch specials, this is my go to place to eat. And the prices are always great. The staff is always friendly and know me by name. I enjoy dinning in, lots of seating and no rush feeling. My faves are the chicken taco salad, taco Wednesday, and the supreme sandwich, I can go on and on. I highly recommend eating here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been eating here all week since I've been in town and the food is absolutely great. it is always packed and is very reasonably priced.
My first day in Phoenix I paid 12.85 for french toast at the hotel across the street when I could have paid a only 3.89 for the French toast at the plaza Cafe.

The menu is easy to read and pretty simple. They have Bagels, sandwiches, French toast, candy, cake and hamburgers. So far I have tried the tacos, cake, a croissant sandwich and a club sandwich. The tacos were amazing! I wish I could have more

They have tons of drinks like Jones' soda, Naked Juice and even a soda fountain. Great beverage selection!"}
{"text":"Sofi always takes care of her customers!   My daughters lunch this year was changed to 10:15am.  Super early if you ask me.  It's hard to find places offering lunch at that time. Each time I go in, I tell Sofi I need to get lunch for my daughter and she springs up and says \"order anything you want I make for you!\" She always makes me feel like I am priority and always looks forward to seeing my little girl. She is the sweetest most caring person I know. Not to mention, ANYTHING you order there you will love, I have not had one thing there that I have not liked and they keep it interesting with the daily breakfast and lunch specials they offer. For breakfast the everything burrito is the way to go! Lunch, Everything!  But my favorite are the cheesy bacon fries (not on menu) but if requested, they will make for you!"}
{"text":"Favorite place by work. The prices are fair. Every item I've had so far were really delicious and good fresh quality. You don't get the same freshness and quality from the other nearby cafe's like this. They also serve delicious smoothies made with fruit juice. :) They get super busy during lunch, so call your orders in at least 15-20 minutes in advanced."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience with the staff. They offer a wide arrange of choices and I am never disappointed."}
