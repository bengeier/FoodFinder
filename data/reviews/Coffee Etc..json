{"text":"Tucked away on a cute street Coffee etc is a great cafe. Trendy design and great Wi-Fi as well. They have outstanding coffee and personable staff. The owners are extremely nice and welcoming. I am looking forward to when they get the outdoor tables and can sip my coffee while watching the T go by."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is a relaxed hip vibe. Logan (the owner) made me an iced coffee with English toffee flavored syrup.  They have so many flavors to choose from. Logan was so friendly and welcoming, I felt like we could have chatted for hours!  Great location, great coffee! Do not hesitate to try this place!"}
{"text":"If you haven't stopped in here on your way through Castle Shannon WYD!!? This local, family run coffee cafe is where it's at! Their coffee is amazing and they have all the specialty drinks you want. I usually just get a large dark roast but treated myself to a mocha today - which you can get hot or iced - and it is delicious! They also have boxed lunches to go. I recommend the turkey & pepper jack. Try one of their breakfast sandwiches, too! They know their regulars by name and are great people."}
{"text":"Great little coffee store in Castle Shannon. I don't give a lot of five star reviews, but think this place deserves it because of the quality of the service and the excellent coffee they serve.   I've been here twice, and have had a latte and a regular coffee. The latte was excellent, with very strong, rich tasting coffee, and the regular coffee was almost just as good.   The two gentlemen serving customers are real friendly and made a point to thank me for coming back for a second visit.   The interior is nice, with several tables and excellent free WiFi.   Prices are good, with the coffee $2 and the latte $3. They have a stamp card that you can get and will get a free drink after the card has eight stamps. I'm looking forward to trying some of their pastries and sandwiches.   This is a real comfortable and friendly place and I'm looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop, enjoyed the coffee with a bacon egg wrap with delicious siracha ranch dressing. My boyfriend had the deli classic and really liked it.  We sat in 2 very comfy chairs in the window. Relaxing, we'll be back"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and wanted to find a cute little coffee spot to stop at, and this was it!  It's a super cute little Cafe, kinda located in a weird spot, but it's so worth the stop! I came in here one morning for a coffee and ended up with a breakfast bagel sandwich as well. Not sure what they do with their eggs and sandwiches but it was hands down the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had! They make them fresh to order and this one was so yummy!  Coffee was also super delicious and the staff was so friendly! It is run by a mother/son team and they both were so kind and welcoming. I love to support small/local businesses and I'll be more than happy to stop here in the future!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this shop and it did not disappoint. Great coffee and food and lovely people. The decor is warm and comfy. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent local coffee shop we discovered through coffee passport. Good breakfast and fantastic specialty drink."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in the Castle Shannon/ Mt Lebanon area.! Awesome coffee and many food options-wish that I had more time to stay. Easy parking and nice interior. Will definitely meet friends here soon! Owners extremely friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"When looking for a good coffee shop in the Castle Shannon/ Mount Lebo area, I have to admit I had low expectations. I assumed I wouldn't find a small business and would be forced to order coffee from a chain. I was so pleasantly surprised when I looked on my handy dandy yelp app and found Coffee Etc. With all of the 5 star reviews, I had to check it out.  The customer service blew me away. We were greeted with such kindness- it was so refreshing. We talked about how we were new customers and asked for suggestions. They explained their menu and the roasts they had available. Brendan went with their house roast and really liked it- he could taste the high quality beans right away. I went with the blonde roast with almond milk. Yes, there was an extra charge for the almond milk, but this almond milk was absolutely delish. I have no idea if they make their own or buy something higher quality, but it was fabulous. My blonde roast was awesome on it's own and even better with the fresh almond milk on top. This was some of the best coffee I have had in a long time. I drank my entire cup, which is a big deal for me (I normally save about half for iced coffee the next day), and proves how good it was!  We had a wonderful experience here and I really look forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Coffee Etc. is a hidden gem in Castle Shannon. Just 1 street off the main road, don't blink or you might miss 'em.  I discovered Coffee Etc. on Yelp and was so excited to see a locally owned coffee shop in Castle Shannon.  This little coffee shop is the best I've been to in the South Hills area. They offer a selection of breakfast and lunch made-to-order sandwiches. All made fresh. And offering \"organic/natural\" ingredients as much as possible.  I ordered an egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant with an iced lavender latte with almond milk.  The sandwich was delicious, not too greasy and a pretty good size.  The iced lavender latte was perfect. I like my lattes on the sweeter side and this one came out perfect. Had just the right amount of sweetness and lavender flavor and creaminess from the almond milk.  The owners were super friendly and helpful in helping me decide on my selection.  Coffee Etc. offers a small town neighborhood, cozy, coffee joint feel. So excited to go back to Coffee Etc many more times! PS. They also have outside tables you can dine at with your pups."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. I'm not sure how they do it but they know almost everyone that comes through on a first name basis. Great coffee and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after an early morning appointment. Relaxing decor and music. Brightly lit with lots of natural light. Great coffee and spiced cider."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! I got the house coffee and the havarti cheese avocado BLT...so good! Great portion size! The service was great and wifi was easy to use. They also have a loyalty program for retuning guests! I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast sandwich..signature rasberry sauce completed this delicious sandwich... Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Loved our visit today to Coffee Etc.! Polite and friendly staff, quick service and delicious breakfast food and drinks! The space is cozy with plenty of seating at either tables or comfy chair seats by the windows.   My husband and I ordered drinks and breakfast. The blueberry scone was fresh and our breakfast sandwiches were made to order and served hot. I usually go for egg and cheese on a croissant and I was not disappointed! The croissant was buttery and delicious, like it should be! My husband enjoyed his Americano and my chai tea latte was light and flavorful.   We both had breakfast sandwiches , drinks and shared a blueberry scone for about $22. They also have loyalty cards, this was a first visit but we already have 5 punches on the loyalty card. Three more and we get a free item!   Glad to find such a nice small business establishment with fine quality in Castle Shannon. Looking forward to coming back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great family-owned coffee shop. Food is solid and the espresso drinks are on point. Being a family-owned business, their service is beyond expectations; they care and they want to make sure you have a great experience. I work from home and have been spending a few hours a week here and they really know and appreciate all of their \"regulars.\""}
{"text":"Just the coffee shop we needed! Amazing breakfast sandwiches, made with brown farm eggs, and the best coffee around no matter what your taste! The peppermint mocha is just what you need to warm up in this cold weather. The owner and barista are always friendly and inviting, and they make my delicious coffee without dairy!"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a coffee shop. They sell fresh sandwiches too! Come here if you want good coffee, an enjoyable/cozy atmosphere, and service with a smile."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today.  I got a Coffee Passport, which is $20 and allows you to order from a special menu for a variety of different coffee places.  I think it's a great idea to get people to try local coffee joints.  I ordered a hazelnut latte from the passport menu.  I don't consider myself a \"coffee officionado\" but I do drink a lot of coffee.  This was a very tasty hazelnut latte and was just the  pick me up I needed.  The staff were super friendly and very accomodating.  I think I'll be checking out more of their menu in the future.  Thanks Coffee Passport and Coffee, Etc!"}
{"text":"I've had a fairly difficult time finding good third-wave coffee In Pittsburgh. Being from Anchorage, which has a great coffee scene, my standards are high, and there are only one or two places in PGH that measure up.  This is now at the top of my list. And they're not even technically open yet.  I drove by here on the way to get a hair cut, and something about the shop's look caked out to me, so I resolved to swing back by afterwards. Their \"open\" sign is covered by a sign that says they'll be opening in September, so I wasn't sure if they were actually serving. I came in to a warm welcome and a quick explanation that they were really just in practice mode but would be glad to serve me if I didn't mind. Of course I didn't mind, and I ordered a latte (my bellwether drink).  Wow. Perfectly executed. Great microfoam texture (with the obligatory latte art fern leaf), and fantastic, sweet coffee (Iron Star beans) balanced perfectly with the milk.  We chatted a bit about their plans for rotating roasters, featuring single-origin coffees, and building up a team of experienced baristas. They have a fantastic start and I am excited to see them succeed.  It's a little far from home (Greenfield), but I get down here every few weeks at least, and so I'll be making it an obligatory stop when in the area...and maybe, just maybe, I might even come down just for them."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop ! Everyone is super nice and welcoming. I got a Carmel latte and it's amazing ! The atmosphere is also very cute ! Great place to sit and catch up or get work done !"}
{"text":"Promising coffee shop in Castle Shannon. Excellent latte - very pleased with taste and quality. I don't eat in the morning, so I can't speak for the food, but there was a good selection, and it looked tasty. Very nice atmosphere. Highly recommend stopping by - let's support this local business."}
