{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrible! The restaurant wasn't even busy our server didn't follow up to check if we needed anything or asked to refresh our drinks.  I probably would have had a couple more margaritas if asked but never was so didn't."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Ohio. I live in so cal so had my share of Mexican food. Try the big burrito, it's good."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive, fast lunch service.  Authentic and basic menu."}
{"text":"Señorita Bonita's is always fast, delicious food with great service. Guaranteed, it's really Tex Mex, but everything seems to be made fresh and in-house. Their guacamole and salsa is some of the best I've ever had in Ohio...and the margaritas will definitely get the job done. (My husband is convinced they dump Everclear in them, but, hey, whatever works!) We often split an order of their dinner fajitas along with an extra order of tortillas, which is more than enough food for two people. Good food, filling portions, and friendly staff. Great place for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Best affordable Mexican food on the East Side. The fish tacos are amazing. Everything I've ever had here was great."}
{"text":"The food is good. Nothing about it makes it stand out above any other Mexican restaurant I've been to. One thing going for them is their margaritas! I really recommend you try their frozen ones. The definitely pack a punch and will surely do the job but not with the overwhelming tequila flavor. I really like their chips and salsa. I always get their enchiladas which are very good. It is not the best Mexican food I've ever had but I look forward to going here with my friends about twice a month. Give it a try...I don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I would have to say that I am impressed with the Venue, cleanliness, and the food. The service was okay not the best but moderate and I think that this is the only thing holding this place back from being better. It is the closest think that I have had in cleveland so far as being authentic Mexican food. Their alcoholic beverages just like their servings are more than generous and very delicious. I got the big poppa burrito this time which is huge next time I will try the enchiladas. Also if you want to even have a chance at eating your whole meal don't eat the chips and salsa they will fill you up. Any how if you do eat them your best bet is to split the meal with someone else."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch today here for the first time.  The food was EXCELLENT, and reasonably priced. It was more food than either of us could eat.  Our server was Meredith  she was excellent,  she was upbeat, smiling and very busy,  she was taking orders, making drinks and waiting tables.  This is our new favorite spot, we will definitely come back. Coronarita was delish."}
{"text":"As stated before, really good chips and salsa.  This time we ate lunch.  Very standard Mexican fare. The mole is not house-made.  Cheese in the enchiladas is that standard Mex cheese.  I will stick with having drinks and chips and salsa at the bar."}
{"text":"A tasty place.  I've never been disappointed there.  We used to live in Southern California so we order atypical things from the menu.  Once the waiter even told us not to order something because it wouldn't be as good as we were expecting."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say.   I know of this place due to its location. It is quite convenient to my hotel and the office that I sometime visit.   We come to this place for lunch, as for some reason my coworkers seem to really like this place.   Maybe because I have lived in California with a Mexican family, and have had some great experiences while living in Colorado, that I expect more..or different.   The place is pretty big, and I can't comment on the Happy Hours or drink selections because I have only been here during their lunch times.     The food usually comes out fast, and maybe because its layered with cheese and guacamole and sour cream you can't really tell if its GOOD Mexican food.  Almost when you say if a steak is good enough, you don't need all the sauces....  I feel that way about Mexican food... I want to really taste more chicken or beef, not more of the additions...  it almost reminds me of fast food.  Like they need to take a step back and focus on the meal a bit more... instead of possibly having a bunch of stuff premade in the back ready to go for the lunch rush.  Maybe they do this at dinner time.    Its not BAD, its just that I have had better...."}
{"text":"After a movie we decided to stop at Señorita for a quick bit. Service was awesome and the first margarita was good. The second margarita came out and the food followed a second later! I was about to take a drink from my drink and I noticed there was a protein snack in the drink...a cockroach was floating in the drink and as hungry as I was, we left! Won't EVER go back! Service was great and the manager handled it amazingly and comped everything. The food looked good, but COCKROACHES, nope, won't go there ever again!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with friends here! Service was fast and friendly - a server even quickly cleaned off a booth with a better location away from the noisy kitchen door for us, without us even asking. The restaurant and restrooms were nicely decorated and clean. Our food came quickly, was hot, and tasted great. I got the chimichangas and my friends both got fajitas - we were all very pleased with our meals. The best part, though? The margaritas! We got there just before happy hour ended and we each got a huge margarita for just $4.99.   If in the area, I would definitely visit this restaurant again and would recommend it to friends as well."}
{"text":"Meredith is an amazing bartender & person!! She was attentive to me & my group in a FULL bar on a Friday night. Will definitely come back anytime I'm in Solon. Thanks Meredith"}
{"text":"Average food. Went there a second time and the beans were horrible, and the side of rice was cold and old.  The sausage quesadilla was bland. Our entrees were ok at best. It was very good the first time, but I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I like it there , this is a very very  nice restaurant , I enjoy number \"48\" its a rib eye with jalapenos ,   the real deal my friend  , , drink a lot of tea !!  I sat in the bar  everyone was having a lot of fun, friendly people at this place , nice atmosphere ,"}
{"text":"ok - more like a real 3.5 stars but we dont get that choice!!  Good gringo Mexican food for the after work crowd.  Service is average but they generally keep the chips and salsa flowing.  No real complaints but nothing super stand-out either.  I've been there a handful of times for lunch, dinner and drinks and it seems quite reliable."}
{"text":"This establishment is near my hotel that I go to when I'm in town.  I pass by it and have been told by many local coworkers that this place is awful.  I have not been here and decided that I finally need to try it myself.  I'm from Southern California so I know great, good, passable, and awful Mexican food.  This was not awful but it definitely was not great.    I ordered the #23, chile relleno and cheese enchilada platter with rice and beans.  The chile relleno was not very good.  It was soggy and not cooked enough.  The cheese enchilada was good as was the rice and beans.  My friends had the chicken quesadilla and the enchilada supreme.  My friend said the chicken quesadilla was good.  My friend who ordered the enchilada supreme said it was okay.  I'm a bit of a chips and salsa hound.  The chips were light and not greasy.  The salsa was mild, yet flavorful.  The bill for the 3 of us wuth tip was $42.00 (the food above, 2 sodas and a 32 oz beer).  All in all, a passable outing to Mexican (American) food in the American Midwest.  I'd give it 2.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me.  I ended up giving it 2 stars because we've all had better."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican in the area (Don Ramon's on Richmond is better).  Went there the other night to eat. Food is ok.  Ordered chicken fingers for my 2 year old.  He wouldn't eat them.  I tasted a piece and it was terrible.  Either stale, spoiled or too old and really freezer burned before they cooked it.  I spit it out so quickly.  Because of this, I will NEVER go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for pretty solid Mexican cuisine, that's a good bang for your buck, Senorita Bonitas is a solid find. The menu is extremely extensive and they offer a variety of combo platters so you can try really whatever you want without having to rack up an extensive tab. I had the chimichangas and was pleased that choice included both a beef and chicken chimichanga. It was not too much for one person and they were tasty but not amazing. Still for less than $12 I wouldn't complain. The best part of my experience was the free chips and salsa, the chips and all refills were warm and wonderfully spiced. I might suggest this as a place for a margarita and tortilla chips, but the price is right and the food is good"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant!  The staff are friendly, the service is fast, the food is delicious, and the margaritas come in pitchers.  If you want a taste of everything, try la familia sampler.  It's enough for at least two people to share, probably more.  The wings are surprisingly tasty as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. I had the carnitas plate and a michilada. The carnitas were crispy and delicious. A michilada is a beer with lemon juice and tajin. Amazing and refreshing."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants. The whole family and daughter boyfriends are l Food is so fresh service is excellent and price is good. The is one of the restaurants we go when wife doesn't want to cook."}
{"text":"First time visit. Stopped in for lunch. Love the atmosphere staff was nice but didn't talk much. Both my son and I love seafood, so we both ordered the seafood burrito. The menu said they were stuffed with lobster, shrimp and fish. Oh Boy couldn't wait! Well, the first thing we noticed when they arrived at the table was that they were very small in comparison to any burritos we have ever eaten.  The first bite was delicious,  but then we couldn't help taste and notice large chunks of green and red peppers that made up the majority of the filling. My son can not stand red and green peppers so he picked them out, but then there was not much left of anything else.  We were both very disappointed to say the least, and these were $9.50 each. The description did not mention peppers!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous meal and service.  The guacamole was homemade and food was hot and delicious. I would definitely recommend the restaurant for reasonably priced tasty Mexican food"}
{"text":"Your typical, nothing special type Mexican food. One major overriding issue: everything has WAY too much salt. The chips have seasoned salt and the salsa taste like pure salt.  Fajitas just ok. Portion on the small side for $13. Nothing special.  Chicken burrito tasty, but nothing to write home about. Maybe it's the below average side rice and beans that detract from the dish. Enchiladas too are tasty, but nothing special. Margaritas are not good. Has something bitter in them. Tried a different one, but same underlying bitterness.   Wait staff attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"The food tastes like your average Mexican food, the service is normal, but my mother found a fly in her food once. I've never been back. She has, and has had fly-free food, but, I refuse to take any chances."}
{"text":"We come here quite often for lunch.  Super fast and friendly service. I think they have the lunch specials ready to go, so we often are served our food just a few minutes after ordering. Always fresh & hot. Lunch special changes daily. For lunch expect to pay $6-8. Probably more americanized than authentic (can't really say because I've never been to Mexico) but it's reliably good. Portion sizes are decent for the price. We frequently come here for lunch birthdays with coworkers, they can accomodate pretty large groups. Recently added an outdoor patio overlooking the parking lot/ nearby hotels(good for smokers I guess, not so good for the rest of us). Cute & bright decor."}
{"text":"We make the drive from Akron to come here, food is always amazing... we haven't had a bad thing. If you get the Quesadilla Los Cabos Dinner, be prepared to share. It's huge and if you order it to go it comes in a pizza box.... but it's our favorite thing to get!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely return. My order was taken right away. Food was delicious. Beef was tender and juicy, shrimp was tender and fresh. I recommend this restaurant to foodies."}
{"text":"This was a convenient choice before going to a movie. The venue was clean and staff was efficient.  I liked the atmosphere.  The three stars is for the average food.  I thought the chips and tortillas could have been fresher but I like the guac.  The chorizo was mostly salty rather than flavorful.  I liked the rice and beans though.  Dinner is between 10-15$ and there's ample parking."}
{"text":"Worth checking out for yourself, Pretty good Mexican food with big selection. Priced right and drinks were good. Only been once and it wasn't too crowded. The atmosphere was lacking. Looks like it could be a fun spot however, something was missing. Maybe it was an off night. Will try it again. Family liked it too so that helps with my return."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a job interview after not coming in for a few years and was,upon walking in, flooded with good memories of lunch with former co workers. Not much has changed and I missed the old days. The restaurant is bright colorful and cheery and the servers friendly! The chips and salsa were as good as ever. I had the veg fajitas and my trip down memory lane was complete. I didn't recognize any servers but, C'est la vie. Hopefully I'll be back working in the area and stop in more frequently."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! We ate here today and I'm in love with the food! I'll start with the chips and salsa. Chips were crunchy and lightly salty. The salsa? The best I've ever had anywhere! It was hot and spicy which I love and you know it's good when there is chunks on onions in it. The meal was incredible. I loved every bite! My brain wishes there was more but my stomach is glad there wasn't because I would have just kept eating! We will probably make this a regular stop now. Yum!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last night for dinner after a day of traveling.  Walking distance from many hotels which is nice.  I sat in the Cantina and was immediately greeted and served a beverage.  Quickly after that salsa and chips were delivered.  Great service throughout the meal!  I didn't think much of the salsa, but I have had much worse...a little tomatoey, but there are some good flavor a in there, just weak.  I ordered the tacos carne asada.  Great dish, meet was a tad dry, but very good.  The beans on the other hand are kinda gross, mix some salsa in and they are better.  So, great service, mid-range food."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite place to come within a 20 miles radius. Every meal is delicious, you can't pick anything bad. Every item with a picture, I've had at least twice and it's always consistently fabulous. The waiters are extremely friendly, and it says a lot when a restaurant has a pretty good amount of regulars. Honestly, I can't say enough about this place, I love it, and it's my favorite place to experience with a new person.  Order a sangria margarita, and thank me later :)"}
{"text":"This is really solid Mexican. Especially when its 9pm after a movie and you're craving a margarita and some Mexican comfort food.  Senorita Bonita's hit the spot with an A+. The margarita pitchers are bigger than your face and super generous. The food is fresh, fast, and the menu is huge. I love that they have everything from traditional Mexican dishes to tacos, salads and burritos. I mean really, this menu is a small novel. I had the chimichangas, which were surprisingly hearty/spicy and served with beans and guacamole. We also had the nachos-- which were good, but very simple (just cheese and meat).  Despite the fact that we got there a bit late, the staff was beyond pleasant and accommodating, and I loved that our server was able to give us multiple personal recommendations. Now, was it the best Mexican I've ever had, ever? No, but it put me in the small food coma my friend and I were looking for, and I can already tell that the service and food are reliable, tasty and fairly priced all around. Senorita Bonita's has my heart for my next much needed Mexican craving."}
{"text":"Large portions, great flavors, and nice decor are highlights. We were there for lunch and the place was very busy, which might have explained the somewhat slow service."}
{"text":"Fast... super fast service on a Saturday!!! The food was on point!! Hot and tasty!! The drinks were extremely good!! Out server was funny and very attentive!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt Cleveland's best Mexican place to eat.  The food is great, the price is right, and the service team is top notch.  Our family loves this place because every time we go, we are treated as family.  We don't even consider eating at any other Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"A fine selection of Mexican style cuisine on their menu.  The decor is bright and colorful with lots of painted portraits line the walls.  A few flats screens are strategically placed so you can get a glance at the news or ESPN. A nicely arranged bar with plenty of seating is available. The happy hours are fun and the drinks reasonable in price.  Our chips arrived to our table warm and seasoned. Bonus points for the chips being fresh. The salsa was light and had plenty of flavor. Just enough spice and heat to enjoy.  It is very easy to finish a basket of chips.  I appreciate that the salsa is not like marinara sauce some of the other establishments serve.  The steak fajitas, chicken fajitas, beef tacos and carne asada are some of the solid items that I have enjoyed.  The chicken and steak are grilled with that nice slight char on them.  Their sides of beans and rice are tasty and compliment the entrees.  What makes this place a pleasure is that they make great food consistently. I have not had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Some Mexican places I love, some are a little lackluster. This place falls under my feelings of \"MEH\" based off of the fact that nothing really blew my mind. Our server was friendly though! Also we were the last to leave, but didn't feel rushed at all by the workers.    We started with a lime margarita on the rocks. This was absolutely acceptable, as we got the Tex Mex option which means they used better quality tequila. Then there was the Queso Fundito and chicken quesadilla starter. I was told that the chicken appetizer was \"not very good\" (I didn't actually eat it since I don't prefer chicken). This is sad to hear since Taco Bell is right down the road... Queso Fundito was okay, but I didn't really like putting it in a tortilla wrapper. Chip worked much better. I just wish it didn't congeal so fast. The enchiladas supreme dish was absolutely flooded in sauce. The flavor was so overpowering that you couldn't really tasty the tortillas and filling below. We did not finish this dish."}
{"text":"Enjoyed chips and salsa at the start and followed up with a beer and fajitas; good meal and comfortable place to enjoy it. Close to hotels."}
{"text":"Order the Big Papa burrito and have them put Carnitas in it instead of beef. The best  burrito I've ever eaten and I just moved from North Mexico (California)...put that fluorescent green hot sauce on top to take it to a ho notha leval. Ricardo is the coolest manager and will take really good care of you when you decide to impress your coworkers with you culinary genius recommendation to have him cater your next office fiesta...muey Bonita :)"}
{"text":"One of my friends kept talking about how his was the best Mexican restaurant in town and I just had to come here to judge it for myself.  It's been hard to find an authentic Mexican restaurant in Ohio, but by goly g.. this place is it!!  As soon as you park your car, you can already hear the Spanish music!  Unlike some other \"Mexican restaurants\" they play whatever is \"hip\" to the new generation.  When my friend and I first walked in, it was right after a rush, and was able to get seated at the bar.  Meredith was our bartender and she is so outgoing and fun to talk to!  She helped us order our food and our drinks!  We wanted our first drink to be hand shaken margaritas and oh man, these were the bomb dot com!! The way she made them was strong yet dangerous because you couldn't taste how strong they are!    I can't quite remember what I ordered but it was steak with peppers with beans and rice.  The beans were so stinking good I was surprised that they didn't taste that your average can of retried beans.  These beans actually had flavor and was so fresh I couldn't stop eating it!  The rice went so well with everything and I kept mixing my beans with them.  The steak was so tender and juicy with every bite!  It was like heaven was knocking on my door with every bite!  So if you have a craving for Mexican, this is the place to be!! What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Let's just say I have a 5 minute rule. If I go to the bar and wait longer than 5 minutes to be acknowledged \"be with you soon...\" I leave. I as there one other time and the service wasn't much better."}
{"text":"This is OK (maybe 3-4 stars) if you are looking for American Mexican but this is not authentic Mexican.  Cheesy restaurant scene but has the Mexican decor."}
{"text":"Friendly service and always very efficient. Colorful and clean restaurant. It's definitely Americanized but then most Mexican restaurants are around here. That being said, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL... chips and salsa here are heaven. I was really impressed. I think I ate the entire basket before I even got my food. And then ate another one after my meal. Basically I would come just for those. But besides that the food is super good too. I had the chicken tortilla soup and ya know not like mind blowing or anything, but I enjoyed it. I also have had the fish tacos... and once again not the best in the world...but for Northeast Ohio... not too bad at all.."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  The ambiance is colorful & festive, the service was great, and the food was delicious. Best guacamole I've ever had!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here; best mole poblano I've had in Cleveland area. Great service too( Meredith!) We will be back soon. $40 for two adults and a kid (no margs this time)."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and loved it! It was a slow night so service was fast. The place was very clean and well lit. Food was spectacular. Im sure its not actual Mexican fair but i knew that going in. I expected American Mexican similar to El Rodeo, El Rio Grande, Don Pablos, (insert other standard Mexican place), ect. It blew all of those places out of the water. Margaritas were strong, food was cooked well and full of flavor, and prices were appropriate. Will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"This was a very unique experience. I had a good time, but only because I was with a rowdy group and the restaurant didn't run out of alcohol. They even let one of our guys bring in his guitar and make fools of ourselves. But, that's literally the only thing this place had going for it. If it had been a picnic bench pavilion area at a park, I'd give it 4 stars. It's not. It's a restaurant.  The food was honestly inedible. The service was unlike anything I've ever seen. The waiters had no idea who ordered what and were screaming numbers at us asking, \"Who got the 37, WHO GOT THE 37?!?\" Listen buddy, I don't work here. I don't know what numbers indicate what meals on your menu. I ordered pork canitas. I have no clue that it was number 62 on your menu. Didn't you take our orders? How come you have no idea where those orders came from or what the meal is called? Once they finally got the plates placed in front of the right people, the food was cold and looked a little too much like dog food. I would never go here for dinner again. That's all I can say."}
{"text":"We have been looking for this restaurant for years. The food is absolutely fresh. Tastes like you might be in California or New Mexico - meaning authentic Americanized Mexican food. The mole sauce is sublime as are the tamales and chili rellanos. The atmosphere is festive, clean, and unique.  And the staff is incredibly friendly and informative.  Oh, and the crème brûlée is wonderful, not too heavy and not too sweet. The tres leche cake is also an authentic and delicious version."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and speedy service this is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. Friendly and clean establishment with a large menu selection.  I recommend the steak fajitas, the taco salad, and the chimichangas! Those are a few of my staples when visiting. They offer a great happy hour during the week and also have daily specials."}
{"text":"Was there tonight they raised there prices and food was horrible. The service was good. My pork was dry and no flavor I sent back. Was not impressed at all. Taco Bell is next door that's how bad my meal was. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch again and tried the Cheese enchiladas this time.  Everything about them was good.  Had to wait a couple minutes for the plate to cool down, but after that I was able to go to town on them. The chips and salsa didn't seem quite as good as last time, but I could have been that I just wasn't in the mood for them."}
{"text":"The service is great. It has always been really quick at peak lunch times. Not too much differentiates it from any other Mexican place around Cleveland. The food is good for the price."}
{"text":"This place has always been very consistent with friendly staff. The food is pretty typical yet solid. I like to start with some chips and guacamole and move to steak and chicken tacos. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Be warned the serving sizes are huge! I got the big papa burrito and it could have easily been shared between 2-3 people. The service was pretty quick and food was hot. (Always a plus) The food it self was just ok. Nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a quick bite.  Sat at the bar as the restaurant was very busy (good for them)  We sat down at the exact same time as another couple.  They were offered chips and salsa and their drink order was taken.   Not us.  They ignored us completely.  When we finally were acknowledged, they continued to ignore us. We were able to give a food order to the bar tender, which he apparently never put in to the kitchen.  The couple next to us ate their entire dinner and enjoyed their margs while we sat and waited.  We did at least have a beer.  When we asked the bar tender about our food order, he SHRUGGED his shoulders at us.  We left a 10 on the bar and left.   Too bad, we like to support local restaurants, but why would we?"}
{"text":"The service is always excellent, and the food never disappoints. You can tell they pay extra attention to detail here. Everything I've ever ordered has been great."}
{"text":"Meh. We came at the end of the night- hopefully that was the issue, but I don't know. Service was quick, but less than friendly. Food came out really fast after we ordered. It may have been pre-plated, we couldn't customize a burrito. Food was meh. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Food looked and tasted fantastic .. Salsa and chips were great also and there are lovely paintings of senoritas lol really nice place will go back again for sure the hamburger my nephew had was great and smokey flavor he raved about! Gracias"}
{"text":"Holy Dudes!!  I'm constantly shocked by the male/female ratio in this place!!  If you are a single girl, hang out here at lunchtime!!  I don't know what it is, but I love this place.  Their chips are good, their salsa fresh (provided it doesn't have a \"refrigerator flavor\" which is hit or miss) and the food is always hot, good, and fast!  PLUS - they have Sol beer!!!  Which I can find nowhere else in Ohio.  Unfortunately I can't partake during lunch but they have a great bar area for happy hour!!"}
