{"text":"Just OK - got take out from here - all 3 items we ordered were very salty.  We did like the Asian slaw - different and tasty.  Do not anticipate going back."}
{"text":"Just an OK chain restaurant. I don't see the value for the cost. I've been to this location twice and both times items on the market buffet line were not well stocked and staff appears to do very little  maintenance on the area to keep it clean, wipe up the spills, etc. that are typical of self-service. There were at least 3 sauces that had run out and we had to ask someone to refill. They should have someone monitoring. 

We had a big appetizer platter on the previous visit that everyone really liked for the variety. Still, I think there are better local options in the area when it comes to value for the money. Even some chains like PF Chang's nearby I've had more enjoyable experiences."}
{"text":"When I first visited a Stir Crazy in Miami, I loved it, and it remains the same with this location. Building your own stir fry is definitely my thing and all-round, my stir fry had a  good appeal to it. Fresh, yummy, and all-round unique! If only there was one on the west side though, but if you are looking for Asian on the east side of Cleveland, look no further! Stir Crazy is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The place has very interesting interior. Food was prepaid in front of us and was delicious. The dessert was fabulous. Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Server was ok cooks were ok but food bar was empty with 3 people in front of me and 11 people waiting for someone to fill it! Unprofessional, management needs to be trained again!"}
{"text":"Stir crazy is CRAZY slow! We waited for 45 min for entrees that are burned / tasteless. The store wasn't even half full!!
Will never go again!"}
{"text":"this place was unprofessional.  they left water on the floor where customers walked past to use the restroom.  the host is rude and snippy with attitude.  the food is corporate mediocre."}
{"text":"We all did the \"Make your own stir fry\" (not sure what their exact name for it is).  All three of the meals were excellent, but I do have a few issues that took down my rating.

1.  The Service was very robotic and mechanical, but she was friendly.  
2.  The Sneeze guard by the \"make your own\" vegetables was too far back and would do nothing to stop, hair, sneeze, etc from falling into the veggies.
3.  There was no place to put the utensil after taking the veggies, so you literally had to put it directly back on top of the veggies. (I'm not a huge germaphobe, but these 2 items were glaring.)"}
{"text":"I love stir crazy. I like to create a stir not order from menu. Yesterday I tried Thai Sticky Wings and pan seared pot stickers. I didn't like them. It's better to create your own stir. Put whatever you like."}
{"text":"This place is just an ordinary stir fry restaurant. The main attraction is the fact its in Legacy Village. I recommend skipping it."}
{"text":"17 dollars for burnt chicken and greasy noodles. Thanks but no thanks.  The service was bad but the food was worse. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Update: I went yesterday and tried the create-your-own-dish style with tofu and rice noodles. I picked generally asian vegetables to go with it, the black bean sauce mixed with a little thai chili. I would say that because you are able to decide how much of each vegetable to put on, you can make this dish pretty healthy. However, it still had that fast-chinese-food taste to it. And if you mix the wrong sauces together, it won't be pretty. black bean is usually a safe decent one. I don't think it was worth the ~$12.

July 2010 review...
My friends and I were originally going to eat at at CPK in Legacy Village, but the line was far too long and we decided to give Stir Crazy a shot. I ordered the $8.88 (cheap for dinner!) Mongolian beef, which was more than enough food for me. We also had the calamari appetizer, which was good. The Mongolian beef dish (ordered with brown rice) had a veggie spring roll, which was crispy and tasty. The problem with this dish was the heavy sauce they used on the beef/veggies. Otherwise, this would have been a great dish, but I was so overwhelmed by the salty sauce that I couldn't eat much of this already smaller dish. I think the sauce was also heavy enough that it didn't really improve the flavor of the beef (which was good)/dish. I tried one of my friend's market-made dishes and it seemed alright - I'll try that if I ever go back here."}
{"text":"Worst take out food ever. Yesterday, I order food from this place in Lyndhurst, OH because I had a taste for something spicy and different. I heard some good reviews about this Asian infused place. So I decided to order some spicy Thai wings, pad Thai, and mango chicken. Took it home to my family; unfortunately, we were disappointed in the food. The lack of seasoning in the Pad Thai, barely spicy in the wings, and the mango chicken was dry. My husband is from Thailand and he called this knock off version of Thai food too Americanize. For the price I paid for this food. I should have taken it back and ask for a refund. 

You're better off at a real Thai restaurant instead of a fake, high price one."}
{"text":"AVOID!!.Possibly the worst restaurant in Cleveland. Hostess down right rude.. She tried to seat folks who came after us. When told that we were ahead, she told us there was a wait to be seated. There were atleast 10 tables and 1 booth that were available. Would give zero stars if allowed. Went next door to the CPK. Great service."}
{"text":"Honestly, I just had probably the best service experience tonight that I have had in the longest time!!! Just on the service alone, I am giving 5 stars!!! It's a Saturday late afternoon and we decided \"spur of the moment\" to come in with my husband and our 2 children.  That's always risky... Especially with a 13 month old! We were promptly greeted and seated. The server (the receipt says Michael S.) was amazing and attentive to my husband and I and our children. I haven't had a server so friendly, helpful, on top of things in the longest time. I had a great meal too which was beef stir fry with wheat noodles! The line was fast and everything was organized and clean. My husband and I both thought the server was outstanding and that is was a great experience! We will be back because we were treated so well!!! Shout out to that server!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. It's about what you'd expect out of a Mongolian Barbecue style chain. Choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions, that is set), add your choice of vegetables, then watch them roast it in front of you. I went with chicken and rice noodles, and a ginger garlic sauce. The finished product tasted like propane. The guys frying everything up work hard, but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place. I still like it better than Noodlecat, though, as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Many of the Kanji on the wall are backwards/upside down."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and found Stir Crazy. Alex was enthusiastic and a great server. The food was fresh and quick."}
{"text":"Prompt service and general portions. The food was only mediocre. I've had a better version of every part of the meal elsewhere, though it seemed to be good quality. The Market, build-your-own-stir fry is novel, and I guess their schtick, but I'd rather have a chef that knows what they're doing make my meal rather than myself."}
{"text":"Decent, but nothing extraordinary.  

I ordered the mango sesame chicken with fried rice.  The chicken was battered and crispy, the fried rice extremely bland.  I found myself comparing it to Panda Express's rice, and losing; at least PE is cheap.  

My thoughts upon leaving were that we should have went to P.F. Chang's, which is pretty close in neighboring Beachwood.  The service and the cocktails (I order a Beijing Breeze) were very good, however.  

If you sit near where they cook the food, prepare to sweat!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice food, OK bar. Long wait for a semi upscale fast food type restaurant. My particular waiter was really cool and nice. A little overpriced, but that wasn't surprise with the area and place, obiously."}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese Pho EVER!

I have to start this review by saying that I was NOT expecting an authentic bowl of pho. What I WAS expecting was a noodle soup that would be tasty.

However, I was served a bowl of soup that consisted of:
- at least 10 raw scallions in one inch pieces
- HUGE chunks of raw meat that were NOT cooked in the bowl and only took on a blue shine (pho is usually served with THIN slices of raw meat that are able to cook in the soup bowl)
- large slices of half a raw onion
- noodles that were so overcooked they couldn't be picked up using chopsticks.
- an ok chicken broth

after fishing out the raw-as-hell meat and all the onion I was left with a quarter bowl of overcooked noodles & 4 shrimp in a basic chicken broth.

For $12.99?? Are you kidding me??

I left just as hungry as I entered! Had to stop by chipotle to get a bowl to go so I could eat some fresh good food.

Will NOT be going back to stir crazy again.

My husband got the kung pao noodle bowl. He said it was 'ok', but certainly not worth the price."}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST restaurant experience I've had in recent memory. 

What was awful? A lot of things. Mostly, the service. Everyone was sour and unpleasant from beginning to end. I'm being kind by not mentioning the name of our waitress, but clearly, she hates her job and had her FML face on blast the entire time. I asked her one tiny question about how to order (it was our first - and last - time at a Stir Crazy, but my question was not challenging, long or complicated) and she rolled her eyes at me, no joke. 

No one seemed to be aware of what was going on around them, or seemed to be in charge. When the patron who apparently had never been in a restaurant before was coughing and sneezing on the vegetable bar and blowing his nose in front of it? Three employees stood with their arms crossed, watching him, chatting, a few feet away. 

Despite having a table in the midst of a seating section, the line from the grill snaked over to us, and no one made an effort to say \"Hey, folks, please line up over here where the line is supposed to be.\" As a result, no one around us could get in and out of their tables, and everyone just had a steady stream of stanky swamp butts in their faces. How pleasant. 

We got our food (a process where you have to stand and wait for it to be cooked so you can take it back to your table - which contradicts what it says on the menu, to take it to the grill for it to be cooked and delivered to your table.)  We sat for five more minutes after THAT because our waitress hadn't realized we'd actually need silverware to eat (our server never stopped back at our table, so we eventually waved down another server.)  My dining partner got the drink he'd ordered when we were seated about five minutes before we LEFT (a half hour after it was ordered). 

The only people who acted like this wasn't the seventh layer of hell were the guys cooking our food, and they have the hardest (and hottest) job in the entire joint. Maybe they can train the rest of the staff on customer service, as well as show the managers how to, uh, manage."}
{"text":"I classify this place as the stir fry version of PF Chang's.  So it is highly Americanized. I went with the stir fry.  I used to frequent a really great stir fry place in Chicago called Flat Top Grill and this place pales in comparison.  The veggie bar could be expanded and I wish they would let you add your own meats and noodles at the stir fry bar.  They really do not give you more than 3 oz of whatever protein you choose which stinks.  And I don't know why I have to pre order everything with the server.  Anyway, food is tasty and service was fine but only 3 stars until they stop being so stingy with the protein serving size."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. I love how you can create your own dish by adding your own vegetable fruits and making your own sauce and you don't have to cook it yourself like in other places. The shrimp they have is amazing, it is just nice soft moist and juicy. Great for a birthday dinner, or any celebration. And so kids don't get mad they have a kids menu. They have all kinds of food... chinese, japanese, korean, mongolian, and even thai. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I had very good experience visiting this asian restaurent. Servive was good and make your own bowl gives you so many choies. Only one thing I wanted Mojito for drink but they didnt had it also they dont have Martini so 4 stars. Overall good except for drink bat."}
{"text":"Largely disappointed with the takeout. The teriyaki bowl didn't include rice, even though the description listed it. Too late to drive back to Legacy for rice.

The sesame chicken was good, but the portions were both so small. $13 for each plate that barely fed two people, or leftovers for days from the local pad tai joint. I know where I'm going next time."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely wonderful! Everything was so great! From the service to the food! My husband & I had the crab cake rolls appetizer, which was my absolute favorite thing I've eaten my entire stay in Cleveland. We also had the imperial rolls, Thai beef BBQ tacos, Kung pai chicken. All with brown rice. Again, this place was wonderful and I'd highly recommend it to anyone! My only complaint would br, beverages were $2.79 each, which I feel is way too high!"}
{"text":"We stopped coming here about 6 months ago.  They were incredibly disorganized and so 30-40 people would get their bowls at the same time.  The line was terrible.

We tried again tonight.  We had a reservation but were put in the queue because the hostess has no computer.  We were seated within 5 minutes so no worries.  The 10 tables around us were still waiting for their drinks 15-20 minutes after they were seated.  A small revolt was about to occur.  When the table next to us asked the manager he was rude and said quite curtly that a waitress would eventually be along.

It became apparent that if we ever did see a waitress all the people from 10 tables would hit the buffet at once and the wait would be horrendous.

The food is ok (when we actually got it).  The prices for entrees and apps is ridiculous.  It is horribly mismanaged and there is no organization.  Stay away. Especially if you have kids."}
{"text":"Just went out there a second time. The food is good if you are looking for something healthier to eat."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location since they opened, we go just once a year, It's our oldest sons favorite place to have dinner on his birthday. It's only been ok to fair 
In the past but has gone downhill so fast I'm surprised they are still open. Today it didn't even deserve one star. Dirty, long wait to be acknowledged, servers have no idea what they are doing, no one actually seemed to know what they were doing. A few of us ordered off the regular menu and some ordered off the stir fry make your own menu. Surprised to come back to the table after making our meals and the rest of our table had been served their meals and were done. The beef or steak (whatever you want to call it) was honestly like hard leather. The fried rice was cold with hard clumps of white rice
Mixed in, we complained and what we were given wasn't any better than what we had although they said it was a new batch. Bathrooms were in bad shape. We have tolerated this service and lack of care for many birthdays since it's our sons special day but even he said today I think we need to find a new place to celebrate."}
{"text":"Decent American chain Asian food. Decent service. Pretty good desserts. I mostly go here if I am in the area and hungry- and everywhere else I would eat has a wait time."}
{"text":"I have been there many times and enjoy the stir fry, last trip there I decided to order off the menu and ordered Mongolian Beef, The was very little beef, mostly vegetables hiding what little beef there was and to top it off the beef was very tough, Also paid extra and ordered fried rice that was not very good unless you drown it with soy sauce. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Tried their bbq tacos and sushi. Tacos were flavorful, shrimp had more flavor than chicken. Gad their spicy ahi tuna sushi and spicy scallop sushi. While sushi had good flavor, I didn't like the rice consistency, it was to sticky for my liking. Otherwise, pretty standard StirCrazy fare"}
{"text":"It's a chain Asian Fusion place, but it is actually quite good.  Fun cocktails,  good food, and large portions makes for a great dine-in or carry-out experience.  

They also feature a sort of \"Mongolian BBQ\" style deal where you can go up, pick all your ingredients, and then watch them make it.  Maybe this is fun for you if you have never seen a cooking show or actually cooked anything beyond a pizza for yourself.  
I don't know about you, but when I go to a restaurant, I think I would rather sit at the table, sip my cocktail, and engage my dining partner in some conversation than sit there watching the chefs sweat over the hot grill.
So, I obviously cannot comment on that aspect of Stir Crazy, however, I like the rest of the place, and the one in Cleveland has a very friendly host and staff."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is really good. 

The staff and cleanliness however.. not so good. 

Went to lunch with my mother and not one employee acknowledged us at the hostess stand. The bartender could see us, but she did not acknowledge either of us or even say hello. There was only one other customer there and she was sitting at the bar, so it's not like they were even remotely busy. However once we did get seated, our server was very nice and came to table often.

The overall cleanliness was disgusting. The bathrooms weren't clean and there were no paper towels to wipe your hands. Another server was in there as well and although she said she would \"let someone know to restock them,\" she didn't. About an hour later, still no paper towels, still not cleaned. If you've ever had to dry your wet hands with toilet paper, you will understand when I say, \"Gross.\"

The make-your-own-bowl bar was covered in old, sticky sauce, all the way up to where they prepare the food. This was most disgusting, because again, other than us, there was only one table of customers. So what's the excuse? Wipe your counters, clean your bathroom! Gross."}
{"text":"Service needs a serious upgrade.  Came in to eat at bar tonight and waited close to 10 minutes and no one showed up behind the bar, or even a hostess or manager.  Eventually just walked out and ate at the Brio across the street.  Terrible way to lose business.  If I was owner, I'd be furious."}
{"text":"My sister and I were shopping at Legacy Village on Valentine's Day, and we needed somewhere for dinner that wasn't packed (hard requirement on that day!). There was only a 5 minute wait for Stir Crazy, so we decided to try it. The waitress was very nice and super attentive... She recommended the make your own stir fry option where you literally scoop as much or as little of all the ingredients you want into a bowl for the chefs to make into a stir fry (I think I will try that next time).  We opted to start with imperial chicken rolls which were nice and crispy, but the only flavor came from the sweet and sour sauce they came with.  My entree was the sweet, spicy chicken with brown rice... It came out with just the right amount of kick so that the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  My sister got the chicken fried rice which was a huge portion and she seemed to enjoy it.  All in all, this was a good option since every other option was completely full, but the food reminded me more of a take out Chinese restaurant than an evening out kind of place"}
{"text":"Yuk sums it up but I'll elaborate.   

Came in shortly after 10 on a Friday night to order some take out and have a beer while I waited.  The barkeep got me a beer and disappeared for a long few minutes.  The bar top was sticky. The place looked unkempt.  The men's room needed servicing.  I hadn't been to Legacy Village in a while and the condition of \"Stir Crazy\" got me thinking maybe this development is in decline.  It was that bad. Like Richmond Mall food court bad.

  Finally the barkeep reappears and I order some \"pad thai\" to go.  Got it home and it was AWFUL. Wow.  Kind of like If McDonald's offered pad thai.... basically rice noodles soaked in carrot juice? Or V8 ? With a 2 Oz piece of chicken on top.  It was so bad I laughed....and then poached some eggs.

Go here if your kids demand it or for an office party if your boss is a cheap SOB.  Pay $15 to watch the guy wok the $1.73 worth of ingredients you just put in a bowl , pretend you like it then write your own review."}
{"text":"---2.5 stars---
Went here for dinner for the first time not too long ago with a few friends. Creating your own stir fry is not really my thing, so I decided to order off of the menu instead. Even though I am not usually a fan of large menus, I did appreciate the diversity of this one. I had the kung pao noodles, which were alright, but certainly not close to authentic Asian noodles by any means. I can see the appeal of this place for some, especially for those who enjoy making their own dish, but personally, I feel that there are so many good Asian restaurants in the Cleveland area with great authentic and slightly Americanized dishes to try that Stir Crazy is a hard sell for me."}
{"text":"Poor service and took FOREVER  to get our food.  Was told it was delivered to the wrong table and \"even though they didn't touch it they were remaking it\".  Never offered anything and didn't check back until 2nd dinner arrived.  Told her I didn't like my dish and that it was bland w/ the exception of the raw garlic.  She told me \"people either love or hate it\" and walked away.  Sushi was fine, nothing you couldn't find elsewhere. Enjoyed the n oodle dish.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I am dropping this to 3 stars as it has sort of gone downhill and our recent experience did not live up to previous visits. My mom and I make a day trip to Cleveland every year in August and have eaten here before going home for the last 5 years.  We came again on a Monday around 7pm and it was not really that busy. All the booths were filled though, so we had to take a table. The tables looked well worn and in need of replacing. No condiments (soy sauce, pepper, sweeteners) or additional menus, napkins, etc on the tables. They were completely bare. They didn't even offer or have in the silverware rolls any chopsticks!

I looked at their menu touting their 20th anniversary, and it seems the company was bought by a new owner last year. Not sure if they are still in a transition stage or what. It touted the \"updated Fresh Market Bar\" where you make your own stir fry (what we get every time), and it was really no different to me than previous years.

Only seemed to be 2 main servers and one that was dealing with patio before a storm hit. Ours was very inattentive. Took close to 10 minutes from us being seated for her to come take our drink order. My mom went right into ordering our food first because she was annoyed (and we had a 2.5 hour drive back after).  We got the market bar stir fry and thankfully, she did bring our containers for that that somewhat quickly. 

The market bar still looked pretty messy. Luckily, I could get a decent selection of most items that I wanted, but no one was around restocking, cleaning up, etc. The cooks though there are always awesome and friendly. They are the ones doing all the work over those hot woks and seem more than pleasant. 

We were happy with our food. While not cheap, the stir fry does give you a big portion. They now don't even charge for Tofu overtop of the Vegetarian price, which made my mom happy, but it is the same $2.50 upcharge for chicken or beef and the serving is very small for the size of the rest of the stir fry. I would check to make sure you like enough of the vegetables on the market bar or you will not have much to eat. Even the noodles you get are not that much.  I probably ate about $10 worth of fresh pineapple in my stir fry though, so it evens out. 

I had a pop (which cost $2.99, jesus!), and even with our server coming through multiple times to other tables, she didn't come to give me a refill. My mom tried to flag her down once, but she ran into the kitchen, and then it took her about 5 more minutes for her to come back around, but first had to go to all the other tables. She had come by literally as we sat back down with our food, too hot to eat yet, to \"see how everything was\", and then that was it .We did not have the big liquor orders of other tables. I just needed a caffeine boost before my drive and wanted to at least get my money's worth.

Though if you are going, go to their website and sign up for the email list. They will send you a $5 off coupon (got mine in about 30 mins) good for 2 weeks following the email."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Stir Crazy-- we've been somewhat regular customers since we moved to the area about a year ago.  If you're familiar with Mongolian grills, this a similar set-up.  Pick your meat, pick your noodle, get provided with dishes.  Go to the produce bar and load up (seriously, load up) on vegetables and design your own sauce.  Hand your selections over to the chefs and watch your conception get stir fried.  If you ask politely, they're willing to add ingredients they have in the back but not the veggie line, like fresno peppers.  

Obviously, since you're designing your own meal, how it turns out is on you as much as it is on the cooks, but I've never had a bad meal here.  If you're feeling less adventurous, ordering pre-designed options off the menu is an option.  We've ordered delivery a few times from this menu and have liked the Bangkok noodles, coconut curry vegetable noodles, and the sweet and spicy chicken.  Service in-house isn't fantastic, but I've never had any major complaints.  The restaurant has always been clean, even despite customers having full run of the produce and sauce bars.  They have a decent selection of drinks and beers.

Not authentic, but tasty, and a good portion size for the price.  There's a lot of restaurants crowded into Legacy Village but Stir Crazy might be my favorite of the bunch."}
{"text":"Food ok.  Nothing I cannot make ar home .

Tonight's service was horrible!!
! It was my first time there with a friend. After being seated it took several minutes to be acknowledged comma initial drinks seem to take forever. The dining room was empty by the way. We both felt like it was a nuisance for us to be there as if we were bothering the waitress. We made our way into the bar to order food, but she followed us and took our order there and seemed distracted. The whole staff that night seemed to be in a daze. I probably will not go back because of the service, or lack of service."}
{"text":"Above average but room to improve. Enjoyed sitting out in the patio for dinner. Ordered California roll and lettuce wraps, drinks and dinners. Seared scallop dish was good.  Seems like they need guidance. Apps arrived before cocktails. Kinda off. First visit in years. Will come back and see if they are ironing out service issues."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start here. I've been going here for years and really enjoyed it until this recent visit. It's almost like it's been bought out or under new management. This is the DIRTIEST restaurant I've ever seen in business. I'm surprised this place isn't shut down (see my photos). In the last year they've had over 8 health violations, including \"pests\" in the kitchen. I'm not surprised by all the one star reviews recently. Save yourself, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Over the years we have eaten here many times only because we really do love the stir fry bar.  I just love stir fry and being able to pick the exact veggies and sauce you want is great.  The food has always been great.  I will say that a \"salad bar\" situation usually creeps me out because of the cleanliness and freshness, but their veggie bar is always clean and food is fresh.  

But I can't give more stars because of the sporadic service and cleanliness.  So it's ironic that I find the food bar clean but the rest of the restaurant looks so dirty!!!  And the bathrooms are horrid and about 100 degrees!! 

There's one female server we try to avoid because she's so bad.  Today we had an attentive server but she was such a airhead. 

But I'm sure we'll be back because we do love the food. 

By the way, they do have \"kids food\" for the little ones so that's nice."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago with my husband. I really like the make your own stir fry set-up and the fact you can pick out all your own ingredients and the sauce you want. Watching the guy cook it up right in front of me was fun and you can be sure the food was good and hot. There is nothing very inspired, just good stir-fry. I had rice and my husband had one of the flat noodles - I tasted the noodles and liked them better (make a note to self to have noodles next time). The price is a bit on the high side but I guess you have to pay extra for being in such a great location (Legacy Village). Service was very good. I will be back."}
{"text":"I had a ladies night out here and we were catered to nicely. This is a good build your own stir fry resturant. Service was great and the GM on duty was great. I gave it only 4 stars because the fix it  yourself bar was a little messy and the items were not named. Also there was hair in one of the sauces, from a patron leaning over whole dipping. However the worker handled it quick and was apologetic. The food was really good and will return."}
{"text":"I went to Stir Crazy on a Sunday for lunch.  The server did a good job of describing how the experience works. Stir Crazy has a full menu or you can make your own stir fry.  I decided to make my own stir fry.   I was thrilled to see that they had both brown rice and whole wheat noodles.  I ordered the stif fry with beef and whole wheat noodles.  You go through the stir fry line and choose whatever veggies you want.  I was underwhelmed with the veggie station.  Veggies were thrown everywhere and some needed to be replenished. For the outrageous price they charge for their stir fry they should have veggies to choose from.  After selecting veggies you go to a station with different sauces.  I choose to mix garlic ginger with kung pao.  You then give your bowl to the cooks and they stir fry your meal.  I asked the cook if I can have light oil, he looked at me then poured a ton of oil in the wok.  Thanks Bro!  The most underwhelming part was how tasteless the sauce was. It was just totally flavorless.  I thought it was just me but both my husband and sister agreed.  I had a bite of my husband shrimp and it was your typical, small, frozen shrimp.  It just wasn't good- period. We had trouble getting our check.  We were getting very frustrated.  Then when we finally got our check the tip was automatically added.  No wonder our server was no where to be found and I had an empty drink during my meal.  This place is overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"I recall coming here once years ago when it first opened. Aside from that, I couldn't recall much else. Should've taken a hint, since psychologists have a name for this natural ego defence: repression. 

Slow service, Vietnamese lobster spring rolls barely had any lobster, gaudy/poorly written Chinese decor, messy dried-out vegetables in the create-your-own stir fry line.

One redeeming aspect was that the tuna & salmon were cooked quite well. Tuna just seared enough so that it was cooked through it's depth, salmon was soft/tender, not overcooked & tough, which oftimes happens w/ inexperienced stir fryers.

Suffice it to say, I shall never return."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since this place first opened a long time ago and it was decent food then now it has gone straight down hill. My cousin and i stopped in yesterday evening for dinner i ordered the Mongolian beef and she ordered the Bangkok Noodles  & Chicken my steak was like leather and the entire dish had no flavor my cousins dish was even worse than mine she tossed her meal and got sushi and it was horrible also only thing was ok was desert management is a joke he did nothing to fix this the server was also a joke he claimed we breached the 2 for 20 deal when my cousin didn't like her meal breach i didn't know we were dinning under contract lol i will never return ever Mongolian Grill On Coventry Is Way Better & Cheaper Than This Place"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it is really good.  Nice selection of entrees and a small but nice wine  list.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the food was luke warm.  I had the shrimp szechzwan and it tasted like it had been sitting on a counter for a while.  Hopefully, if we come back this problem will be resolved.  Kind of disappointing but I did have a coupon.  Servings are on the small size."}
{"text":"probably one of my favorite restaurants in cleveland. for some reason it's hard to get many good vegetables in this town, either on menus or in a grocery store, so i really appreciate the make-your-own stir fry aspect, as well as being able to pick your own sauces and get exactly what you want.

they also have a nice selection of asian dishes. my favorite is the cashew encrusted tilapia, with garlicky spinach and rice. delicious! although i have noticed in the last three years that it has become less cashew-encrusted and more cashew-dusted, but still it's delicious peanutty goodness keeps me coming back. my friend usually get the double pan fried noodles. some of the dishes (like the pad thai) seem a little bland, but i just order what i like and am happy.

desserts and drinks are expensive but tasty. they pack a powerful mango mojito, one drink and i was practically under the table."}
{"text":"The four of us went for happy hour after visiting a local store.  We sat on the patio.  The weather was nice and the patio wasn't crowded.  Ideal for some chill time.  We partook in their  25oz $5 margaritas.  They are $5 for a regular and a $1 for flavoring.  2 of us got strawberry and 2 of us got passion fruit.  Here's a hint, the passion fruit margarita was custom made for us so ask away if it's a flavor that you love.  It's definitely not on the menu.  The margaritas were tasty but not strong.  If you are looking a place to down a couple to feel a certain type of way, this wouldn't be the happy hour for you.  What I can say is good it seems that the flavoring wasn't syrupy or anything.  It seemed like it was a puree.  I have had the food before but since I didn't have it this time around, I can't speak to it because it's been awhile.  If you're looking for a patio to chill at in Legacy Village with a large kiddy drink, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Another trip to Stir Crazy hoping to get our lontime favorite Thai Curry Bowl. This time we even told the manager when we walked in that we had had trouble getting it the last visit because they \"forgot how to make it\" but they manage to do it for us. He said they would do it as well as they could. We also told our waitress it was a special dish for us and had been a longtime favorite, (many years) and described as a noodle \"soup\"bowl. We were given a standad menu item, Thai curry vegetables because, apparently, the only employee who can make the dish was off last night. We learned, from internet reading, that Stir Crazy won a special soup award, The Golden Ladle, in Manor Grove's 9th annual Soup's On Competition just last year for its Thai Curry Bowl recipe competing with over 1100 restaurants. Why then can't they put it back on the menu and teach someone how to make it??? I think we are giving up on Stir Crazy. We will just have to make our own!"}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place, since it is a really neat concept.  I have tried it (3) times and did not enjoy the food any of those times.  I thought the dishes were bland and uncomforting.  Frankly, I am amazed they have survived for as long as they have..."}
{"text":"For the quantity and quality of the food for the price, Stir Crazy is fabulous. I grew up in Cleveland, and when I'm home, Stir Crazy is a go-to for meeting old friends to catch up. I've only ever made my own stirfry, so I can't say much about the menu items, however they always look tempting when I see the wait staff carrying out plates.

It can get annoying when you're trying to focus on your convo and there are screaming children (I believe they have some kids eat free night...which accounts for the influx of little screaming ones last time I was there)."}
{"text":"My first time going to stir crazy was a few weeks ago with my fiance and a few of her friends. I'll have to start out by saying i was not impressed. The place was packed people waiting out the door to get a table, which there were several open ones, and the bar was pretty much wide open. Service was slow and our server was anything but attentive, it appeared he only had 1 or 2 other tables. Took forever to get our drinks that we saw sitting at the end of the bar for at least 5 minutes and our app came out about 15 seconds before our entrees. I ordered what had appeared to be the most spicy item on the menu and again it was anything but. Rather bland when \"asian\" cuisine is know for a lot of bold flavors. Not impressed will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant several times over the years.  Unfortunately this time ( last night) we couldn't ignore the fact that it was dirty, and uncomfortably hot.  There didn't appear to be any air conditioning on.  This was just the beginning of a bad experience.  The cocktails were all too sugary.  Making them all undrinkable!!! The home made ginger ale tasted like fizzy lime juice. Our meals were bland and late.  One of our party had his meal ten minutes after everyone else.  We won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Place we steady wth customers, not busy, not slow. The hostess sat us and realized the table was dirty, so she said hold on she wanted to wipe it down. She wiped off the pieces of food, and not the whole table. The booth was full of crumbs. We ordered drinks and got the market bar. Our wok's were sticky and gross. The floor is absolutely disgusting, my shoes literally stuck to the ground. I kept picking my feet up to make sure I didn't get stuck. The market bar was basically empty on every vegetable. We asked 3 different bussers/servers if they could fill the market bar. Never happened. The cooks were very nice. They were the highlight of our visit. But their cooking stations were very dirty. Not the best place. Good food. But worried about the cleanliness and customer service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for dinner the fist time and it was amazing. They were not very busy but that was even better for us! The crab Rangoon appetizer was really good, but it was more crab tasting that I am used to. I had the peanut noodle salad and chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"I went here with my mother for dinner after a long day of shopping and traveling.  We were very hungry and since I am new to the area, we wanted to check out some of the restaurants nearby.  I ordered the szechuan chicken with lo mein noodles and my mom had the sweet and sour chicken.  Nothing complicated.  We ended up waiting for what felt like forever before we finally received our food.  A couple who had arrived after my mom and I received their food well before we did.  Either there was a mistake or someone forgot to make our order... either way it's sloppy and the food was okay at best.  I think I'll be trying some of the other options the next time I want to eat out."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered Pho Bowl, Fried Rice dish, Double Pan Fried Noodles, and Wassabi Salmon. Terrible :(
The salmon was the only decent thing, but you'd have to be an imbecile to mess up salmon. The staff was terrible too. Need I say terrible anymore? Terrible, do not waste your time, the atmosphere did nothing for us either. 
I will say that I did not try the \"Market\" selection where you create your own stir-fry. But I've been elsewhere and created wonderful stir-fry for much less (ever in C-bus try BD's Mongolian BBQ). I just can't see myself going in there ever again."}
{"text":"My family loves eating at Stir Crazy in Legacy Village. It's a fun place to take my toddler and he always asks to go to the \"noodle restaurant\". I like to order off the menu and my husband likes the make-it-yourself bar which does give endless choices. Four stars because it is usually really crowded, but we've still never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table. Fast service as well with polite waiters/waitresses!"}
{"text":"Has an upscale 'Panda Express' kind of feel almost. 

Overall good quality food when it comes to the ingredients. Just not in love with how its prepared. They also skimp on the meat and it's definitely overpriced.

I'll probably be back knowing its for a meal a couple steps above fast food/Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service ever! Took over 10 minutes to get our bar drinks and there was only 4 tables inside. Then when they came they were not the right drinks! Waitress took forever to refill our water. We got the create your own meal and had to find someone who worked there to fill up empty items on the buffet! I had to get up and get our own chopsticks,soy sauce and salt because our server was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop for something healthy to eat during a strenuous day of retail therapy! I definitely suggest taking advantage of the make your own stir fry, but be careful of the sauces as those can add lots of calories and sodium to your dish if you aren't careful."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but overpriced, especially for the subpar service. 

After an okay past dining experience at this location, we opted to meet out of town family here. I called ahead and made a reservation (which they do for parties of 6 or more) we arrived at our designated time, yet still had to wait almost 15 minutes to be seated. The entire reason we called ahead is because we had 3 small children with us, that had just spent 5 hours in a car, and we wanted to minimize antsyness. Once we were finally seated it took long enough for our server to take our drink order that we had all decided on our entrees. We ordered our drinks, appetizer and entrees at the same time. Again a long wait for our drinks. We were not given silverware upon seating, and in anticipation of our meals arriving we asked our server for them twice. When they didn't arrive (or even mentioned) on her next pass by I asked a passing server if he could have her bring them by. she didn't. The manager brought out appetizer out over 40 minutes after ordering it. I asked him for silver ware, which finally arrived. Within 2 minutes of the appetizer, our food arrived. The whole point of the appetizer is for everyone to snack on while waiting for the food, and at this point there was no reason for it as our food had arrived. 

When the food did arrive, half the meals came first, and then 2 came out 5 minutes later. I understand having to run back and grab the rest, but that is a really long gap when serving a party seated together. My husband's food was poorly cooked, and the wrong cut of meat, and the rest of the food was just okay, nothing to write home about. Once we had our food, the server didn't check on us until about 10 minutes after we had finished eating, and then another 10 minutes to get our check. We were in the restaurant over 1hr 45 minutes. Having made a reservation, and having 3 children under the age of 5, spending that long in a restaurant was almost unbearable. 

I'm usually more patient but when dining with children there is less margin for error. And honestly this experience was just outrageously wrong. The manager did compensate us some for the poor service, but it was too little too late. I won't be rushing back here anytime soon, and will probably be on my last choice list."}
{"text":"The food was good, I just wish their was more heat to my sea bass. Laid back vibe. I was expecting a different crowd. The bar tender is real cool."}
{"text":"Stir crazy is extremely delicious. They're known for the make your own stir fry bar. I wouldn't recommend getting anything else off the menu. They have so many options vegetable and sauce wise, and the people who make your stir fry are rally friendly."}
{"text":"Stir crazy is very overpriced for what it is. I've been to places with a similar concept before and for less money, you get an all you can eat stir fry experience. The selection of vegetables was weak and proteins are limited. Overall, it was rather disappointing of an experience to bear through."}
{"text":"I've only been once. Perhaps there is something good on the menu that I don't know about. If you know of one, please share.

I had the \"pho,\" which was not pho. Thick noodles, tough chunky beef, tasteless broth, really sweet sauce- basically bears no resemblance to real thing. Eat at your own peril. Then go to #1 Pho downtown to \"fix\" it."}
{"text":"$8.88!!! 
Prosperity and good fortune x 3?! Couldn't pass up one of these specials. 
Had the Chicken Pad Thai which came with a veggie springroll. Springroll was very fresh and crispy. The Pad Thai, well it was a fusion between Japanese flavours and Thai flavours. Yep, so the chicken had been marinated in Teriyaki sauce then grilled and then tossed with the Pad Thai which is what made the dish a tad too sweet. The seemingly odd combo was pretty good though. 
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I mean, think about it. Its a menu that serves Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, Vietnamese and Thai. It's a chain restuarant throughout America and the interior is just way too stylish. (!) Its probably not going to be \"authentic\", so you gotta think outside of the box when you walk into places like Stir Crazy and P.F. Changs. These places are not targeting Asian clients who are looking for good old fashioned grub from their childhood days. Think of this as \"Fusion\". haha!

Now the issue of service that some other reviewers seemed to have...I don't know if we were just lucky that day or what, but we got really good service. We were seated immediately, our waiter came and checked on us numerous times and even the manager came over and chatted with us. 

First visit, I give it 4 stars. Cheap fusion, good service."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. It's not the best to be honest. I ordered the schewan chicken with fried rice. The rice was saturated with soy sauce. Too much and inauthentic. 

Our service started off slow. Waited don't know how long just to get our drink order in. We asked for edamame and it hadn't come out by the time our entrees arrived so we cancelled it. Our waitress made it right though and still gave it to us and put it on her. I had to get up to fetch silverware because we didn't have anything to eat our food with. 

The buffet looked good. People around us had bowls of delicious-looking, wok-tossed food. 

I will probably come here again and try the buffet. Service needs to get better though."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch, it was great. I highly suggest lunching here for the lunch combos menu if you can leave work. The serving sizes were HUGE (see photos) and easily would fill two people but only one order needed. What a steal!!!!

There were only two draw backs. First, the server was all over. Attentive about me being in a wheelchair but also forgetful of our table..... Had to wave him down a lot, re-request items, and remind him of our order. Second is that we never got the egg drop soup that was suppose to come with the order."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a very upscale area and it seems a bit deceiving thinking it may be of higher quality than it is.  It looked like a good idea at first, something different in a sea of chain restaurants that catered to the mainstream diner.  When my colleague and I walked in for dinner, the restaurant was about 1/4 full, which seemed unusual as busy as the area seemed to be.  

We were greeted and our order taken quite quickly, however, when we went up to assemble our ingredients, many of the vegetable containers were empty or had slim pickings.  The chef, if that's what you would call him, seemed very bothered by us walking up to his station and actually expecting him to cook our food.  He took our containers without a glance or word, cooked it, and put it in a plate and essentially shoved it back at us over the counter.  Despite this, the food was decent and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Really flavorful and very fresh food. I asked them to alter their Mongolian Beef to my taste.... Spicy, no problem!!! It came and tasted so wonderful I couldn't believe. Only comment in a sort of negative way, too much sauce for me, but other than that totally awesome. Think about asking for lighter sauce unless you like lots of sauce."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. First of all we were here on a Wednesday night at 7:00 pm. They said they were short staffed. It would be a few minutes before they sat us. Thirty minutes later they sat us and then it was another 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by a waitress who was too busy taking pictures of the table behind us!! Then another 10 minutes went by still nothing, you guessed it we all walked out. The staff was not even surprised. Also, I used the ladies room, it was filthy. I mentioned it to the bartender and surprise no one to clean it!! By the way the place did not have too many customers in it. There was no excuse for the long wait!"}
{"text":"I got the coconut curry vegetables to go. My order was ready when promised & correct. The brown rice was good- round & sticky- and the vegetables were crisp. That said, the portions were off. I got a heaping pile of rice & a small side of veggies/tofu and couldn't taste the coconut flavor at all (it was a red curry). Definitely not worth the $11.75 price tag, but that's Legacy Village for you."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients and service!  This is a stir fry place in which you select your own vegetables and sauces and they fry it for you with your choice of meats and with rice, noodles and choice of it being made into soup.  It's extremely delcicious and healthy food and reasonably priced.  Service is excellent and ambiance is noce for family or a date."}
{"text":"Food and service were solid.  I feel like this is like a slightly cheaper, not quite as good PF Changs.

I had some hits and some not quite on target dishes.  I loved the Thai wings.  Sesame chicken was ehhhh.  Coconut shrimp was what it should be, but the sauce was a stand out.  Cold peanut noodles were good.  Mojitos were good in flavor, but a bit weak in alcohol content.

Portions were also large for lunch leftovers!

I thought the quality was consistent with the price.

I'll be back for those Thai wings."}
{"text":"I always pick Stir Crazy over any other restaurant in Beachwood/Legacy village when I'm in the area. I used to frequent stir crazy way more in the past, but made it in here last month for the first time in a few years. I immediately noticed that the atmosphere seemed a little run down. It could definitely use some sprucing up! Along with the fresh market bar that could look a little neater! Besides the disappointing atmosphere one thing that has always remained consistent is the food.

I always go with the fresh market bar and I have never been dissapointed. You tell the server the starch (I always go with the rice noodle) and meat that you want, and they they bring you over a bowl that you can pile high with fresh vegetables! You pick your sauces and garnish then you take it over to the wok and they cook it in front of you! The end result is a large portion of a fresh healthy creation of your making! It doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. The service was great and the food exceptional. It is nice to have the choice of either making the meal as you want it or ordering off the menu.
Not much more to say. I recommend this place when in Beachwood."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today around 3 o'clock and decided to sit on the patio because of the beautiful weather out and the lovely scenery around the restaurant. There were only 6 guests eating in total when I arrived and it took 7 minutes to be greeted and to have a drink ordered.

In that time, I decided to select the make your own bowl as my lunch meal aka your basic fried rice and with chicken, beef, shrimp combo and added my own vegetables and sauce. This allows you to pick your own vegetables, protein, noodles/rice and sauce that appeal to your own taste; create your own! After ordering, your empty bowl will be dropped off and you then proceed to fill the entire bowl with the vegetables (PLURAL FOR A REASON) and sauce bar to select what you would like. Hint: drop a tiny bit of sauce from each into the little cup and taste test. The second to top left sauce is BOMB.

Then get ready to watch the magic happen as it is stirred crazily in front of your own eyes; bravo to that man stirring all of that and not getting burnt.

Overall, my experience being waited on was very poor and the food was adequate. Don't be afraid to try new flavors outside of your comfort zone, be a little crazy!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars because they don't list any of their nutritional information anywhere.  They have a wonderful make your own stir fry however, but the sauces don't really tell you what is best to pair them with.  They had a very wide variety of vegetables and condiments to add.  Chili's, ginger, peanuts, etc and pineapple along with any vegetable you might want.  I was just SO confused by the sauces.  I questioned the waitress and she said they don't have any nutritional information at all about the sauces so I was hesitant to use what they suggested as far as amount.  They say 3 ladles for a dinner and I used less than 1 as I dragged out of the waitress that the sauces are very high in sodium, and fat.  They have steamed brown rice that was very good.  All considered it wasn't bad and I would go back for the make your own.  We shared a tofu lettuce wrap and they were pretty tasty but again, you could tell that it was a \"SODIUM\" overload waiting to happen.  Stick with the make your own if you go, it has endless choices."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night a littler after 9 p.m., unfortunately they weren't expecting the last minute rush and I'm assuming sent some of the workers home before 10:00 so they were a tad bit slow. The food was hot and fresh when it came out which made the wait worth it. The waiters and waitresses were nice and were very apologetic for the wait time and compensated up by not charging us full prices and taking things off our bill due to the extended wait times which is something I greatly appreciated. The raspberry mojito was pretty good and the strawberry lemonade was tasty. The spring rolls and potstickers were cool but nothing to write home about. I LOVED the mango sesame chicken and fried rice!! My boyfriends sweet and spicy chicken was also to die for. Overall I will definitely return since they were friendly and had pretty good food."}
{"text":"After work and before class, I faxed an order to Stir Fry for carry-out.  After calling to verify receipt of the order, I was informed that they had not received my fax.  So I placed my order over the phone.

I ordered the BBQ Thai Noodles and my co-worker ordered the Sesame Chicken dish.  The noodles in my dish were very thick, almost too thick to pick up and they definitely took some effort to chew threw.  It was like ultra-thick spaghetti.  The flavor was good and the quality of the ingredients seemed good too.  My co-worker said his chicken was bland and the overall dish was so-so.

I give three stars because I had high expectations for this place.  My expectations were not met.  Would I go again?  Probably.  But if the next dish is just average, like the BBQ Thai Noodles, it would probably be my last trip.  $24 for two dishes and a coke to-go.

On the fence."}
{"text":"Before heading to an alumni mixer, my friend and I decided to stop and grab dinner beforehand. She suggested we go to Stir Crazy, as were in Legacy Village already. I slightly hesitated (another wanna-be asian place?), but went in, nonetheless.

The restaurant was quite large. We were led to a booth (after the hostess had asked my friend when \"he\" was coming...not realizing 1.) she was with me, not a he, and 2.) I was outside parking). Our waitress was perky, talking about the menu, talking about her favorites on the menu.. good job. Her recommendations were kind of boring- \"get the pad thai!\" but still, she gave some type of recommendation.

My friend got the sesame chicken with broccoli. I got the thai coconut chicken curry. My friend commented that she enjoyed her dish. Mine... was strangely over-soupy. Don't get me wrong- the flavor was actually quite good...but..it seemed to be all watery curry....where were my noodles? And chicken? And just..stuff in it? I think it would have been better with less soup-i-ness, and more noodles and meat.

We decided not to get dessert (waitress: \"do you want some deep fried wontons ice cream?\".... in my head, i was like, \"omg, seriously?\"), but paid the bill and left. The waitress we had though was super friendly- always filling our water glasses and being chatty.

This restaurant is okay- if you want more of the \"fast food\" of asian foods....would I go back? Meh, maybe. I think they might have had some vietnamese spring rolls on the menu...."}
{"text":"After shopping in Legacy Village, we were starving!!! Me and BJ's first choice for dinner was The Cheesecake Factory, the place was packed and advised of a 1 hour wait. We decided to try Stir Crazy. The restaurant didn't have a wait and we got a table right away. I loved the interior, high ceilings, interesting decor. Our server greeted us fairly quickly, explained the \"create your own stir fry concept\" where you pick your ingredients and watch your meal being prepared. After wandering around Legacy, we were not into that. So, we picked something else from the menu. For an appetizer, we shared chicken pot-stickers. They were served with a soy ginger and a chili plum dipping sauce. They were really good and we both enjoyed them! 

BJ picked the Crazy Coco Lime Shrimp. It was served with carrots, red peppers and snow peas. The sauce was coconut lime. He wished it would have been a little tangier. I got the Szechwan Shrimp dish which was AMAZING! It included mushrooms, onions, broccoli and red peppers. The veggies were incredibly fresh and the sauce had just the right amount of kick! We both got the brown rice, which was very good. My dish was so big, I was unable to finish it and got take out. On the way home, I dreamed of being able to create such a yummy dish!! 

We needed some sweetness, so we got a couple of the Just Right Bites desserts for $2 each. I got the Asian Apple Pear Crisp and BJ got the Mango Creme Brulee. Perfect ending to a super good meal! We will definitely go here, again!"}
{"text":"Always good food here.... I wish they had one on the west side..... healthy, fresh,  yummy.... The crab Rangoon with the sauce are the best anywhere!"}
{"text":"Never going there again. My friend was nearly finished with her meal when I had to flag another waitress down and ask about mine. When it was finally delivered, the waiter said it was \"put aside,\" whatever that meant. Our waitress never came to check on us. Had to flag someone else down for more sauce. After the bill came, had to walk to the bar to pay the bill because waitress never came back. Enough."}
{"text":"This location is located in Legacy Village. They have happy hour from 3-6 pm Mon-Fri. They have $2.50 domestic bottles and certain half price appetizers off! I went here during lunch hours around 4o'clock in the afternoon. Soon as I walked in we were greeted and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or booth. We decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and told us the happy hour specials. For drinks we ordered beer and for food we ordered half off appetizers which were Crazy Shrimp and Thai Chili Wings! The shrimp itself was good but it was very very sweet. And the wings itself was good as well but very very sweet! I woudn't come back here for their appetizers at least not these two. But I will come back for the happy hour specials and maybe try something diffferent. But overall It was just an A-Ok place."}
{"text":"A fun thing to do once in awhile. Of course I'm talking about \"The Market\" - the make your own stir fry area of the restaurant. This place is never very busy in my opinion - I never have to wait long in the market line (well not wait behind other customers, tho you do have to wait while your food is cooked). They have now adjusted their pricing which seems to be a good deal - for just a one time charge of $1.50 you can get seconds and thirds and... Then for just $2.99 extra you can get one to go which makes for a very cheap lunch the next day - and you can change how you make it, including your meat and grain selection so it won't be the boring same thing."}
{"text":"The food is always ok.  like- since we are in the area, might as well go here, ok.  i like to make my own dish and our waitress was soooo sweet and let me have noodles with broth, but the veggies cooked on the grill.  It was great!  - had a soup with noodles and some veggies I threw in, and some grilled veg!

Good place to pop in if you are in the area- not really a destination."}
{"text":"The most positive take away from this dinning experience is that a new General Manager was just hired to turnaround and improve the restaurant. 

The potstickers were okay, slightly undercooked. The daily salmon sushi special was not as good as the average  local grocery store. The sushi came without ginger, although it should have. And the seaweed was very chewy.  In addition, there is a cup for soy sauce, which means it would be good to ask if a customer would like some. My guess is the don't have anyone doing a final QA before food is sent out to diners. 

We ordered the make it yourself stir fry. The ingredients were well picked through and it was obvious the counter was overdue for a wipe down from the food and sauces. To the GM's credit, they addressed the situation quickly but it shouldn't have gotten to that state. 

You'll be fine going to this place is you don't high expectations. But since it isn't inexpensive I will not be going back for a below average experience."}
{"text":"The mango sesame chicken wasn't crispy enough, I could
feel the dough. The sesame seed were raw and there wasn't enough sauce on the dish. The Kung Pao was ok, but nothing special. 
The mango mango drink is too strong and the mango flavor tastes kinda fake. 
For sure there are better Asian options in Cle, so skip this one."}
{"text":"We all chose to order from the Market Bar. My friend has a peanut allergy and informed the waitress who said she would add it to her ticket (you get a ticket that you bring to the stir fryers that list your starch and meat). The waitress forgot to add the allergy information on the ticket. Good food but poor waitress."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Seems to always be consistent. Very friendly wait staff. Give the Asian Chicken Noodle soup a try for starters, and Lobster Rolls. Can't go wrong with a stir fry. Will continue to go back for great food and even better service."}
{"text":"After moving into my dorm, I came here with my family. There was about a 25 minute wait. Once we were finally seated, it took a while for waitress to come over to our table to take our drink order. Since ordering our drinks, it seemed like we never saw our waitress. That aside, we ordered lettuce wraps to start. With these, you build them yourselves and were very good. For my entree, I ordered orange peel chicken and upgraded to fried rice instead of brown. The portion had plenty of food with some to take home. This restaurant also had a \"build your own\" type thing where you get rice and a meat. You also get to pick and choose any vegetable, sauce, etc.. Once you pick all of this out, you take all your veggies and sauce to the chefs and they cooked everything together. My dad got this and said that it was very good. All in all, I thought that the food was good but the service wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Cool place to eat because it is customizable and they cook the food in front of you however last time I ate here there were two high school girls running to hostess stand and it didn't seem like they were very organized. They were keeping track of tables on a piece of receipt paper. This place needs to have a standardize system to keep track of guests tables"}
