{"text":"This place was ALRIGHT. Customer service was lame and the place is dirty. Originally wanted a torta but there was no bread and the employee didn't apologize or offer a free drink or something to make up for it. I ordered a quesadilla and it was overflowing with cheese- just a bit too much in there. The lettuce in my order looked like it was 2-3 days old. I won't be goin back."}
{"text":"Really like this place and became one of my favorite's after my first time, I really like that they don't charge for gauc and sour cream. Like the family business service."}
{"text":"The tamales was very dry.
They had to be microwaved.
Rice was dry.
Refried beans were very good.
Carne Asada was ok.
The cashier put my meal in sideways in the plastic bag I had to turn it right side up so I could carry it out properly"}
{"text":"I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and it was  so cold that the cheese was still in grated form and it was like taking a bite of just cold cheese. There was like no beans in it either.  The tacos were ice cold and not fresh.  Cafeteria style."}
{"text":"Stopped in because I've passed this place and always wanted to try.  I got myself a bean and cheese burrito with guacamole on the side and it was amazing!
One of the best tasting burritos I've had in the area.  I've had two different ladies serve me, one rolls the burrito HUGE.  The other rolls it medium size, I mean it doesn't bother me either way because it doesn't take away from the taste.

I haven't tried any other food there but for burritos, this place is the spot to go!"}
{"text":"I was invited by the owner to come since I gave a negative review when they were under different management and the name Taco Caliente.  Plus, I had a 50% off any entree coupon, so I gave them a try.  Well, they are better than Taco Caliente was, but not by much.  I ordered corn tacos with chicken, carne asada, and shredded beef.  The shredded beef was actually quite good.  The chicken was the worst--it was dry and crusty in parts.  The carne asada was so-so.  Not much flavor.  It is nice that they come with guacamole and sour cream for no extra charge.  The salsa bar was not there.  Another customer came in and asked when it would be back and the owner/worker said something about not being sure.  I am guessing it is not homemade salsas.  
Unfortunately, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came here not expecting much, had a groupon that I got for $5 for 6 tacos and 2 drinks, so I thought we'd give it a try. We had the carne asada, pastor, and green chile tacos. I chose mine on soft taco shells, my companion the hard. The server was friendly and did not give an attitude for groupon, unlike some places. The food was fresh, the pico de gallo was tasty, and the hot sauce packed a nice punch. Looking at the prices and tasting the food, it was very reasonable even without a groupon, so yes, I will go there again."}
{"text":"I stopped here on Cinco de Mayo , Johana who served me, totally explained my options and was beautiful , I will be back....lol"}
{"text":"This place is great. I just took my 6 year old out of school for an appointment we needed food. He asked for tacos and let me tell you this place delivered. He's not a picky eater but he doesn't usually eat a lot however here he eating like a champ. In his own words \"this is my kinda place.\" I concur."}
{"text":"We used to come here when it was Taco Del Mar, but the service had gone down and the prices WAY up... 

When we saw the new store front we were skeptical, but oh my goodness I'm SO glad we did!!  The guys who bought the place are always so sweet and the food quality is awesome.   The portions are HUGE and the extras like sour cream and guacamole are INCLUDED IN THE PRICE!  That's like unheard of anywhere!!   

They're always running great specials and I've never been disappointed since they took over.   We go at least a few times a month now (if not more :P)  

I love being able to tell them exactly what I want in my burrito as they put it on in front of me -- then I know I'm getting exactly what I want (and I'm a picky gal).   

Great food, great prices, great customer service... I'm sold!  

I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Tacos for you, wasnt for me. I recently went here with a buddy of mine and we both thought the food could have been better. I got 4 tacos and he got a burro enchilada style. We enjoyed the friendly service and set up they had in the restaurant, however we felt like something was a lil off about our order. It just didnt seam as fresh as it could have been. It smelt great, looked great, but just missed out on top notch flavors. All in all i would say its a good joint, but maybe a hit and miss one at that."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE!
The chicken is boiled, the beef taste fake. No flavor to the Spanish rice. 
I could hardly eat it! I go to various Mexican food 4 days a week - this is bad.
AND it's expensive. They charge extra for guacamole and beef."}
{"text":"I love this place and come here once a wee.  The staff is wonderful and the food tastes great!  It is cheaper than a lot of other places too which helps."}
{"text":"I love the green sauce!!  Fast service rarely busy, and very friendly staff. Food seems authentic."}
{"text":"This place used to be a Taco Del Mar and it was awesome. Anyway I was really craving taco del mar and thought is give this place a try.


I got cheese enchiladas. The lady made them and rolled them up and then put them in the microwave.......I almost left right then. Really the microwave? What am I paying you for I can make crappy enchiladas at home. And as I expected they were pretty bad.

Everything here is just super bland. The rice, the red sauce, the beans etc. Its usually easy to tell a place is going to be bad when the only change half the sign from the old restaurant. Taco del Mar....into.....Taco4U.  

There are plenty of good Mexican food places around this just isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Wow what a worthless place.  I can't believe I just spent 35 dollars on food from here.  I wouldn't have spent 5 on it.  Stale tortillas runny beans cold food tasteless.  Plus they ran out of ground beef.  Should have went to Taco Bell would have actually been much better."}
{"text":"First things first....I'm a taco snob.  I've traveled all of the border towns from Tijuana to Juarez and have eaten a ton of legit tacos in each town.

I bought the 6 taco Groupon and gave this one a go.

The Good:  Lots of food for the money.  I had 6 tacos of varying types of meat and ended the afternoon legally stuffed.  Definitely a bit bigger than the standard street taco and the tortillas were double-wrapped.

The Bad:  My meal consisted of carne asada, chicken, regular carnitas, and Green Chile (pork).  Corn tortillas with pico, onion, cilantro, and mild green/red salsas.  All but the last one were flavorless.  Like boiled meats.  Like crockpot meat with no seasoning and too much water.  In fact, if you blindfolded me and told me to take a bite of each, it would have been difficult to discern which was which.  I was sorely disappointed.  The only half-decent savior was the Green Chile (pork) which was more spicy than flavorful.  Still, it was something after the five strikes before.

I'd love to recommend some EXCELLENT spots in Phoenix to the people who rate this 4-5 stars, but I realize that's not the point of this post. (You folks have no idea what you're missing, though!)

My recommendation to this restaurant:  Fix your meats."}
{"text":"First visit Oct 2014. I ordered 3 mini tacos with ground beef filling. There were about 6 other people dining. Service was quick. The lady behind the counter was nearly impossible to understand.

The fist two I ate were chewy when I discovered they were using two tortilla shells, not sure why that was. The third one I ate just one shell and it was much better. I suppose you could use the extra shell that came with each one to scoop up the spillings and make a 2nd one for each one I ordered. 

The food was decent but not award winning, the only bad part was the lady behind the counter being nearly impossible to understand. This was way better than Taco Bell. The place was clean inside, parking easy and plentiful. Good location, good hours."}
{"text":"Microwave it!!  Yes they do use the microwave on the counter. Come on man!  

25 minutes in line with one woman working the entire restaurant.

Didn't honor the yelp 25% percent off coupon. I was told \"we don't do that anymore\". Come on man! Friends had the groupon discount. Don't buy it on groupon either!!!

This place is a dump. Sat on a torn seat to add to the misery.

Will tell everyone local not to go in this hell hole.

Not honoring my coupon pissed me off the most. Filed a complaint with yelp. The owner is deceiving people to come in using this tactic."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house, so I've come here twice. I've gotten the nachos and the junior burrito. Nachos are good and the burrito was good. I just didn't think there enough options for the burrito or the nachos."}
{"text":"Well...Look if you are wanting good mexican food I will take the 100% blame for expecting it from a place called Taco 4U.  I do not know of any place that ends with -4U that provides a stellar culinary experience.  Ordered the taco plate w rice - white plain rice with corn and shriveled up peas and that was their \"mexican\" rice I guess.  The tacos were a glorified version of Taco Bell tacos and the only reason they were a glorified version was because there was a few sprigs of cilantro.  I didn't touch any of the salsa because it was bland and just not good.  I really truly enjoyed my soda pop though!

Like I said, I am to blame for this experience - I was hungry and instead of driving to 5 other restaurants that would have blown this out of the water, I settled for here.  My bad."}
{"text":"I found this place completely by accident and it was great!  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried!  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!  Love it!  Can't wait to go this week!  
The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.  Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon. :)"}
{"text":"For me personally, my carnitas and green chili carnitas tacos were the bomb!! Loved them and would eat them again. 

For my husband, who had a ground beef and a carne asada taco, he didn't like them at all. The ground beef looked like some weird hash and the carne asada was chewy and flavorless. So....if you go, order the carnitas!"}
{"text":"The sauce they put over the enchiladas has cinnamon in it. Not sure if it was an accident or not but I thought it was awful. Very odd....."}
{"text":"I don't come here as much as I used to since I moved further but when I do food is delicious. I've tried the shredded beef and the chicken and they both are really good. Better than chipotle if you ask me. Large serving for a great price. The only thing is I wish they would display their hours so I know when they're open. But other than that everything is great."}
{"text":"Baby girl was feeling tacos so I checked my trusty Yelp app & found Taco4U close by with decent reviews. Easy to find and the location is clean. The lady who helped us was very pleasant & personable. She recommended the green chili pork so I gave it a try. I actually got it in the burrito-enchilada style so I can try their red sauce too. Baby girl got the 2 hard taco place with beans & beans. Our experience here was pleasant but the food is kinda blah, it was good but nothing to break the heavenly trumpets out for. I wasn't too impressed with the hard tacos even though they looked appealing. The red sauce though was pretty authentic so if your looking for \"authentic red sauce\" this place has a pretty good grasp on it. When we roll all Mexican we like to flavor the culture so a horchata & a Jamaica did the job for wetting our whistles. Unfortunately, they aren't freaking awesome so again-no trumpets gloriously playing to their awesomeness. Last but not least the bill. Kept it under $20 for 2 meals & 2 drinks which is always good. Checked in w my phone app so I had a 25% off $10 or more bill to use. Not exactly sure but the way the bill reads I got 25% off 1 item. Hmmmmm.......this is me scratching my head. Still in search for the most amazing, horn tutting, authentic Mexican fiesta I can find. This close to the border & I can't find good grub, WT........"}
{"text":"2 stars for nice people but the food is NOT quality .  The meat and rice and beans all were flavorless and \"wet\" .  The salsas were ok but nothing to write home about .  Save yourself the trouble and go to filibertos or even better go to somburros .  Sorry but this place is just no bueno ."}
{"text":"Food was cold, no taste or seasoning on the chicken, it was just boring and the cashier seemed annoyed that my business was interrupting her texting or whatever she was doing on her phone while ringing me up. She seemed to be in charge but the place was empty so just horrible customer service skills.  The young in training woman preparing my plate had great customers service skills but missed that the food was all cold.  I wouldn't go back and it wasn't edible, affordable or good sized proportions. Threw most of the dinner away because it was cold and tasted horrible."}
{"text":"We came here because we got a good groupon for us and the kids. After readings the yelp reviews I was a little apprehensive because they weren't great but they are wrong!! We had a great time and the service was outstanding! It was only two ladies working so it was a little slow when they got busy but the food is so worth the wait! The chipotle chicken, carne asada, regular chicken, and guacamole are awesome! And the kids think the quesadilla was rad! I definitely recommend tacos4u!! :)"}
{"text":"The quality of food seems to have gone down a bit... but I still recommend it.  The main reason I'm lowering the star rating is because they don't have a clue what gluten free is.  However, Sprouts and Cafe 8 are right there."}
{"text":"Food was great, place was filthy. I couldn't bring myself to finish my meal because my imagination went to a dark place. If the FOH was that bad, the BOH must have been worse. Tighten up, the recipes are solid."}
{"text":"I want here for lunch yesterday. It was really affordable, delicious, & walking distance from my house. I will be returning there soon."}
{"text":"Tortilla chips that are store bought. The chips were fhe biggest portion out of everything I received. Red salsa literally just taste like watered down tomato sauce/paste. No \"salsa\" flavor whatsoever. Green sauce/salsa pretty much the same with slight different flavor.  If I wanted cold tomato soup, I could have done that myself without spending $18.00.

Refried beans, also taste watered down. No warmth. Spanish/Mexican rice, next to no flavor. Tiny portions. Carne asada platter...more like mini bowl. I could fit the amount of diced up carne asada that was covered in lettuce/cilantro and tomatoes, in the \"red salsas/sauce\" (tomato sauce). Again, spent $18.00 on this?? WTF?

Lastly, the cheese only enchilada. Smallest cheese only enchilada I have ever seen. The cheese that is in there was cold, and almost as if this was \"made\" yesterday and reheated today for my order. Nothing about this order is good. 

I waited 45 minutes for my order, 30-35 minutes of which was the \"cook time\" and I am still very hungry. Now $18.00 out of my wallet for piece of crap food that is going straight in the trash because it's that bad."}
{"text":"Huge proportions, friendly staff, music isn't child appropriate but that doesn't really matter to me."}
{"text":"I usually like to start off my reviews with the positive, so here it goes. 
Value is definitely the highlight of this place as there's some really good deals on select days. I think it's 2.99 burritos on Mondays, free churros on Tuesdays, and kids eat free on Sundays? I'm sure there are other daily specials, but I can't remember all of them. They also have a good salsa bar with pico, onions, cilantro, peppers, and a few different types of salsa (depending on the hotness level). Food was like okay. i wouldn't salivate or dream about it or anything. 

Now to the part that kind of made me cringe:sanitation.  I went to bathroom and they ran out of soap! Actually, they didn't even have a soap cartridge inside the dispenser. Also, the hygiene of ppl serving food was a little bit questionable. Example: the dude put on gloves (good), but then with the same gloves he touched the food, bills, and the cash register without changing them once. Now that is just disgusting. 

Let me say this before people think I'm being too harsh. I've had street food in Mexico, Vietnam, Korea, Phillippines, and Indonesia. If you ever had street food in those countries, then you know damn well you may be risking some unfavorable bowel movements later. I'm not being picky, but I just don't want to get food poisoning and throw up for a good 2 days straight. That is all."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Large portions for a good price too. Simple menu and  only takes about 10 mins for your food. Fresh churros are a plus!"}
{"text":"This place is the WORST MEXICAN food I have ever had in my entire life!!!! DISGUSTING!!! My son is not a picky eater and he literally spit the enchiladas out!!! I should have known since this place is always a ghost town with NO customers!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great value and yummy flavors. I got a mini taco combo with chile verde pork, shredded chicken, and shredded beef.

Pork: tasty, good flavor 
Chicken: bland, meh
Beef: SO GOOD! Seriously, this took me back to my childhood with the same taste of a place a grew up with.

Salsas
Red hot: taste like too much paprika or something, I didn't like it
Hot green: yum! Nice flavors.

I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I like that the food is baked instead of fried, so it's a lot more healthy for you, but it still tastes good. Good selection, friendly service. It's a nice little \"hangout\"."}
{"text":"I love this place and come here once a week. The staff is wonderful and the food tastes great! It is cheaper than a lot of other places too which helps."}
{"text":"Good value overall, their specials are phenomenal with free churros, 2.99 plates and kids eat free days. The bad thing is the service, it's not exactly the warmest or friendliest. My daughter and I got the 3.99 specials one was 3 mini tacos, the other was a burrito both with drinks. Not bad at all for the price."}
{"text":"The customer service really just awful.  The meat looked old.  I thought about leaving.
But I bought it any way.   I figured I could wet it down with the salsa bar.  I was wrong.  Salsa bar has been shut down.  Salsa only at counter.  Just great, not only do I have to buy old food I have to beg for salsa rations at the front counter.  The teaspoon of salsa was enough for a mouse.  When I went back up for more salsa the girl gave me the stink eye.  She pretended she did not understand me.  I asked for more salsa 4 times.  The food prices are just ridiculous.  Meal deals are 9 bucks without a drink.  Good grief! 

Bad service, crappy food, high prices, salsa rationing.  NO thanks.  I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent! I had a groupon so I thought we would give it a try.
So glad we did. 
Love the chipoltle chicken tacos! 
This is a great option for healthy Mexican food made fresh to order. 
I am only sad I dudnt try it sooner! 
Excellent customer service too. 
I have found a New favorite!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food the best Mexican food I've had it's cheap and I just hope the owner brings back chorizo"}
{"text":"We had been going by this place several times when shopping at the Sprouts next door. We decided to give this joint a try today. Wow! Awesome tacos . There chipotle chicken is amazing. The red and green hot salsa is also amazing. It appears to be a family owned place and that makes it even more better . Love to support local family owned small businesses. We will sure visit this place again , likely every time We shop at Sprouts. Highly recommend this place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great price. Staff was super friendly and nice. They have a lot of selection to choose from. My kids are super picky and they even found something to eat and loved it. Nice quick taco place other then Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Well my wife ordered a chicken chimichanga and when the food was ready about 10 or 12 minutes later. she took a bite and turns out it's a ground beef chimichanga.  She then took it back up to the counter and said that I had ordered a chicken chimi not a beef chimichanga  they told her that's the only way it comes.  Wonder why they didn't just tell us that they don't have chicken chimichangas when she ordered that.  And one other thing they don't have any red enchilada sauce."}
