{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, fast service , and fair prices, good for family and couples the only thing is the small parking in a front"}
{"text":"Resto moyen sans plus. Sa fait la job comme ont dit... Il n y a pas beaucoup de ce type de resto (delicatessen) à Laval. Si vous êtes moindrement difficile sur le goût évitez l' endroit."}
{"text":"Nous avions besoin d'une sortie au restaurant pour se sauver de la senteur de peinture de la maison. On voulait pas payer cher. On a trouvé cette place avec Yelp. On a eu droit à un spéciale 2 pour 22$. Ma femme à pris une brochette de poulet et ma à une assiette de Scampi en papillon. Ce fut très bon pour les protéines et les légumes étaient justes. La serveuse à donné un bon service. Ma femme à pris 1/4 de litre de vin pour 4.95$. On y retournera c'est certain pour ce prix."}
{"text":"Very good food for reasonable prices. The staff is awesome! They even deliver. Very quick service. The only thing is that the parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family. Staff was extremely accommodating. 

Ordered the souvlaki pita with fries and salad as a table hote. Soup was excellent. Pita was very good but a bit on the spare side, salad and fries were very good. Rice was decent as well. Got coffee and rice pudding with syrup. Everything was very solid.

Would come again."}
{"text":"Quiet Restaurant, I am not sure how to describe my experience, but Yelp says it all \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" It's not a WOW restaurant, Its not where I would take a date, nor family. Food is average. Could not say much more of the staff."}
{"text":"The meal itself was meh to be honest but the service was really warm and friendly. Waitress literally stood on her head to make sure that all went well, which we really appreciated.

We had ordered their pizza once and that also was ok, not the best, but not the greatest. Not sure if we will be returning or ordering in from this place.

Parking can be a little tight!"}
