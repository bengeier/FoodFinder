{"text":"This little hidden gem is overshadowed by larger viet restaurants in the area but it's really quite decent ! The portion sizes I don't think are as small as what some of the other reviews give it credit for and really it's just that the bowl is deeper instead of wider (which keeps the food warm for longer).   the soup base and pho were both decent but what was really surprising is that they have afternoon tea which includes a few HK classics along with their regular viet menu selections. Service as well was superb but maybe that's because I went for a super late dinner.   I'd say if you're around the area, it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"No Longer a Pho Restaurant anymore even though they kept the name. Doh!  Went there after about 6 months and was very disappointed that the restaurant is now under new owners or possibly their Pho chef left.  Bottom line, PHO IS OFF THE MENU!!  The menu is now Hong Kong style breakfast, rice, noodle, with some other dishes and was rather disappointed too that the food is only so-so in flavour.  Price was reasonable compared to other places but not to Congee Queen standards.  If they kept the Pho AND added the new menu that would have been better.  Message to the Chef.  Learn to MAKE Pho!  Sorry not going back again"}
{"text":"The only reason this place got a 3 star rating from me is due to their price. The portions are on par with other restaurants such as Canteen, Congee Queen, and Phoenix, but the price is $2-$5 cheaper. The only reason you would pick this place is due to tight budget.  Personally I would never revisit this restaurant again. This is probably the 3rd time I've visited. I tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The taste is really really below par. Food feels homey but more like what your bad-at-cooking grandpa's product.   I had breakfast here before. I ordered satay beef vermicelli. The soup was clear water with msg&salt, with satay sauce floating on top. The vermicelli was really hard too. I only ate half.  I had pho for lunch before which is pretty bad because the broth tastes off. I've never had worse pho before cuz I thought you can't fail at it.   Today I visited for dinner. The soup if the day was again salty with msg and basically clear water as broth. The minced pork and string beans was bad because it wasn't flavourful. The beans were still hard. The wonton soup with beef brisket pho had ONE small piece of beef, wonton had no shrimps inside.   The server was one old grandma and she moves really slow. Everything takes a long time to reach us and she doesn't understand English. At least the place is clean."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for dinner with the wifey. This used to be a Vietnamese restaurant and I guess it wasn't doing so well, so they converted into a HK style restaurant.  Let's focus on some of the positives first.  There aren't a lot of HK style restaurants in the Greensborough area. The only one would be Tao Canteen across the street and now this one. Given that fact, I was quite excited to try the place out.  There was actually more people than I expected at the restaurant as well.   The prices are very reasonable and so are the portions. Their menu is quite extensive, which is nice to have so many options.  Now onto why I gave the place 2 stars. The food was really mediocre. I ordered a baked chicken rice with tomato sauce. I have to say that it has to be one if not the worst one I have ever eaten at a HK style restaurant. The sauce was horrible, tasted like something out of a can, and was nothing like normal tomato sauce that would normally come with the dish. As well, the rice felt really dry and is definitely old rice because the rice was actually hard. Out of everything, the chicken was the only thing that was edible.  I ordered the milk tea that came with the rice. The milk tea isn't amazing either as the the tea flavour was really lacking.   Given the fact that there are many options an extra 5 minutes drive away, I would opt to go the extra mile for a much better meal. I hope they continue to improve as they have only recently changed the style of restaurant."}
{"text":"Great value! Ordered takeout for the all-day special- beef brisket and wonton noodle soup for $4.99, came with a drink. Added  $0.50 to upgrade to cold drink. Generous portion for such a low price. Would come here again  to try other menu items."}
{"text":"With all things considered this place deserve 3 stars because it's okay. I'm not jumping out of my seat to eat there again but it's not that terrible. I've been there twice for lunch. I've tried 3 items from the happy hour menu. So far,  I've only been happy with T1 the pho. The things I like about the restaurant is that it's quiet and clean. The waiter is pretty nice and attentive.  I feel neutral about the parking because the parking lot is small but I did managed to find a spot the times I was there. The things I don't like about the restaurant is their serving portions and the taste of their afternoon coffee. The pho is on the happy hour menu which makes you think that it is way cheaper than the other times but the bowl they serve you is actually the small size. The price difference isn't that far off. They only have 2 sizes for pho and the small is actually really small. The taste of the pho is not bad but I don't think it satisfied me. I don't think I will be revisiting any time soon."}
{"text":"For pho, this place is expensive. Don't be fooled by the bowls. They look small, but they're quite deep. The beef noodle soup only comes with a few strips of beef - disappointing. Same goes for the beef & tendon pho. There is definitely better pho uptown if you don't mind the drive. The service here is pretty decent, but the restaurant is so small that it's hard to have poor service. You will always have a chance to call them over when needed."}
{"text":"Came to this place after it had changed from Vietnamese restaurant to Chinese/Hong Kong style. Food was l mediocre but the price was not bad. I agree with the other review about the tomato sauce, it was the worst I have ever had. The biggest thing that makes me don't wanna go back is hygiene. Our server who is a middle age lady had long and dirty nails."}
{"text":"A very big disappointment. Apparently the menu changed to Chinese cuisine. Service was so poor, we decided to leave without even eating."}
{"text":"Went to this place when it first open and it was very disappointed. Service is average. Food wasn't authentic at all. The vermicelli had water at the bottom of the bowl and there was so little sauce that came with it. The shrimp roll appetizer didn't even come with the correct dipping sauce!! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. You know a place is going downhill when they don't accept credit card anymore. Came here for lunch with my family. First they got our order wrong and be defensive about it.  Then we ordered udon in soup. Portion size is tiny and we can scoop it up with one chopstick. Requested for more, they declined and wants us to pay for more. Service is poor. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"So we come here almost every Sunday for a quick brunch before running errands because they have good customer service, clean, quick, pretty well priced chinese style breakfast food.  Portions are just right and tastes good!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite oriental breakfast restaurants in town. I usually order the pork chop vermicelli or the fish cutlet. The soup base for the 1st dish is amazing and is full of flavour. The pork chops are also done very well and the portions match those of other restaurants. The fish cutlet is also amazing, especially the sauce. The fish is pretty large and it comes with 2 eggs and bread. Overall the food tastes amazing and I come here all the time and best of all the prices are extremely low."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service! However, while the menu is very affordable, the food is all covered in a thick sheet of oil, which makes it very unappetizing."}
{"text":"This place is now HK style cafe instead of Vietnamese Pho. Best value & taste for HK style in the surrounding area.  $6.95/$6.99 combos come with white rice, a side dish (Curry Beef Brisket, Tofu, Pork Chop, Green Veggies, etc.) and a soup/drink.   They have a few all day breakfast deals for $4.50. (oatmeal + egg sandwich/toast; wonton & beef brisket noodles)  Milk tea needs improvement - not strong enough/not enough milk."}
{"text":"There's a lot different variety of Asian food here. Not limited to Vietnamese.   I had the afternoon tea special of French Toast. It was alright, just as expected. I ordered an Iced Tea as well, but it tasted like the plastic cup. A little put off by that. My fiance ordered Satay Pork Noodles, the waiter brought it out and came back 1 minute later saying the cook made a mistake and gave chicken instead of pork. He did as if we wanted to change it. We opted not to, and he kept the chicken. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Fast. Cheap. Delicious. Need not say more  This place is a great spot for a quick meal that's cheap. It's delicious and lots of choice. I'm happy to stop in and grab something and the place always seems to have lots of people in it. It's a good vibe and lots of selection.   They have a few daily all day specials, breakfast and lunch/dinner specials. I went with brisket in soup with rice noodles and beef fried rice and veg on the side.   Delicious meal for two people that keeps you under $15 total. It's hard to beat that. Yes to other reviews this isn't a pho place, it's a quick Asian diner and nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place actually serves HK style food not Vietnamese food even though the name of the restaurant is \"Viet Kong\". The prices of their items are really cheap, which would be the only reason why I would return. The portions are on the smaller side but I guess that is what you get by offering lower prices than other restaurants. In terms of taste, the food is average."}
{"text":"Always come here every Sunday. Food is fast, cheap and good! An absolute hidden gem with plentiful parking and friendly service. Would recommend for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Highly questionable choice of Restaurant name...if anyone is familiar with world history.   Unfortunately food was disappointing. Pho beef broth tasted like beef broth....from a can. Very light on toppings and the bowl it was served in was small, pricey too.   Was hoping to have a new Viet spot closer to home, but I'll drive another 4 minutes for Kim Dinh!"}
{"text":"Decided to try their breakfast menu. Well.... It's a big disappointment however I didn't expect to be good. That's the worst part. Ordered 2 breakfast,  one came in reasonable timing and the other on is 30 mins late because the waiter gave me the wrong order. How I don't think I deserve to wait for 30mins. Food quality is lower then expect and my expectation has been lowered when I walked in."}
{"text":"I do not agree with other's negativism of how they took pho off the menu.  The pho served here was literally below standard quality.  HOWEVER, their new and re-vamped HK menu is holy god good.  I came back in last Sunday to eat lunch with my bf and omg they were packed .. usually they have an empty place when you walk in.  But now let me caution you this is the HK Cafe for anybody who lives north of 16th Ave & doesn't want to go to New City or the Phoenix Restaurant.    Their prices are so reasonable.  They charge well below what the Phoenix charges but the quality is quite similar - although the menu is not as extensive. The food comes out pretty fast for a small diner.  The food is on par with what you would expect from a HK diner.  I've had: The satay vermicelli and beef = would go back for. The french toast = my favourite, favourite, favourite - please give this a try if you're feeling something sweet or a little dessert after your meal. The egg and ham sandwich = I love how the bread is HUGE here and they load the egg and the ham on (and they don't overcharge you like mad here) My boyfriend had the beef brisket noodles and he said it was \"good but not perfect\".  This is my go to for lunch now. They have an extensive lunch time menu that includes a drink and is still very price effective.   Please come here instead of Canteen.  It'll be easier on your stomach (no seriously) and on your wallet.  HAHA - side note: the Asian lady who helps serve now doesn't really quite understand English well (or so I think). She asked me what I was eating so she could get me cutlery and I said \"French Toast\" and then said it again in Chinese - but I think she heard me say \"Toast\" and she was like: okay you can eat it with your hands :) instead of giving me a fork and knife."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  There is a reason that this newly opened \"Vietnamese\" restaurant has this funny name. At first I thought it means Viet Cong but it really refers to its Hong Kong Vietnamese Style food. Or you can call Asian Fusion?!  I came by for lunch and surprisingly I did not order anything off the lunch menu as most of the items are priced at close to $10 and mostly rice based or stir fried noodle. Almost all the customers were ordering Beef Noodle Soup instead. I think they might have to redo their lunch menu.  Special Beef Noodle Large ($7.95) has a nice broth with a good mix of herbs: star anise. I suggest not to order anything with the beef flank as one of the toppings as the beef flank/tendon was one of the toughest rubbery thing I ever ate.  Viet Kong also has an Afternoon Tea menu from 2:30 pm.   So Lunch and Afternoon Tea Set just like Hong Kong Style Cafe but with Asian Fusion/Vietnamese food?  Not bad for a neighbourhood restaurant just for variety but definitely not worth going out of your way for this.  Grand Opening Special 10% off."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this new place in the neighbourhood considering there isn't that many options for \"cheap\" Chinese food around there and this is a new place.   At first I got to say parking at that plaza isn't that easiest Plaza is kind of small but somehow every time I go there parking seems to be pretty full.   As for the food.......(the dots can continue), went there for dinner and ordered the Hainanese Chicken with Rice, House Special Beef Rice Noodle Soup, and Mung Bean, Red Bean & Grass Jelly with Coconut Juice.   Hainanese Chicken with Rice: Disappointed. Mostly rice, and I mean mostly! Only 4 small pieces of chicken and the flavour was off.   House Special Beef Rice Noodle Soup (large): Average or slightly below. Seemed a little expensive for large since you're getting a ton noodles but not much ingredients. Soup base was ok wasn't the worst and wasn't the best.   Mung Bean, Red Bean & Grass Jelly with Coconut Juice: it tasted ok but jelly was jello? wtf...   First and probably the last time going there. The restaurant across the street (not going to name names) is definitely better for Chinese food and that place isn't outstanding either but more acceptable for price, portions, taste, and ingredients."}
{"text":"It's a decent place for the price you pay.  There aren't a lot of options for HK styled food in this neighbourhood and this is the better one around here.  Their set menus are great but would love to see more lunch options."}
