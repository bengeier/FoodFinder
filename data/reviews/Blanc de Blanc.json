{"text":"My husband and I were living in Montreal for a month in a sublet without laundry.  We found this place online and thought it would be a great option for us. We  thought we could sit and have a drink while doing our laundry.  We were wrong. I was made to feel like a complete idiot and as if I was inconveniencing the staff simply by politely asking if I could purchase detergent.  It's a laundromat - you'd think that would be a common question.   The machines are outdated and it feels more like a boys insider social club than a cafe/laundromat.  There are definitely better options in Montreal."}
{"text":"J'ai eu un véritable coup de coeur pour ce petit trésor caché du Plateau!  C'est un endroit ideal travailler. Plusieurs tables, très éclairé, magnifique terrasse à l'arrière où on peut s'installer pour travailler au soleil. Belle deco vintage, cafe délicieux, prix abordables et personnel sympathique. A essayer absolument si vous cherchez un café sympa pour travailler."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the laundromat side of things since I've never used them, but as far as a cafe goes, I really enjoy coming by this place. The food is good, and I've actually had some nice conversations with the staff, never felt cold. They recently started doing pizzas which are pretty delicious (choose your own toppings, cheeze, and meat) and I love the woody environment and terrace. Only knock I have is that service can be very slow when busy, they seem a little understaffed at times."}
{"text":"Ambiance relax. Excellents croissants. Et un plus pour moi, lait d'amandes en substitut au lait dans mon cappuccino. Resto simple, mais très bien situé sur un coin de rue. Terrasse agréable à l\"arrière. J'adore."}
{"text":"C'est de loin mon café préféré pour travailler! On peut s'installer sur la terrasse entourée d'arbres ou à l'ombre sous le gazebo. L'endroit est paisible, chaleureux, on s'y sent chez soi. C'est un petit trésor caché du Plateau. Bref, un incontournable selon moi!"}
{"text":"Disgusted to see the STARVING DOG roaming around, skin and bones, begging patrons for food. I told the waiter the dog needed food and looked very thin. He laughed at my face, continental-style. I'll drop a note to the SPCA as well. This is absolutely disgusting. I gave half my sandwich to this abused animal. His behavior displays clear stress signs."}
{"text":"Quaint, great food.  I got the bagel with lox and an americano.  Service was a bit slow but not a big concern."}
{"text":"Blanc du blanc - one third: cafe, back patio Shangri-la, and laundromat - rocks!  Ive been coming here since shortly after moving onto the Plateau: two years ago! (On 23 August!!  Wow 2 Yrs!) The first year (before having my own flat) I came regularly for the great ambiance laundromat., coffee and wifi. This past year I occasion here because I love the big potentiality back patio fertile earth vibes; and swing by for morning coffee.  Normally, I have the whole patio to myself!: great grape vines over head, birds chirp tunery, and dripping gurgles of the small fountain weaving their cool balm through the urban soundtracks and the courting cicadas! =D  The coffee and the few daily fresh baked things are always satisfying.   Theyre freshly painting the place, and the revitalizing love feels great.  A sweet spot on the Plateau"}
{"text":"You live in the area? You get hungry and want to chill out? You have legs? Then walk your ass over here and sit your ass down. This is the place you walk to, eat and chill out at. They have washing machines, sure, but I've never used them. Coffee is top notch. Staff is friendly. Service is quick. The terrasse is a nice touch."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast!  We will definitely be back. Delicious fresh ingredients, fresh baked croissants, artfully arranged fruit.  I can just go and on about how great this was."}
{"text":"First, we waited 50 min to get our breakfast. Note that the cafe was almost empty (2-3 other people aside from us) and we didn't order anything special. Then when we got our food and asked the waitress whether they had ketchup (for our fries, nothing extraordinary, really). She was clearly annoyed, said \"no\", and rolled her eyes. The veggies and the grapes in our breakfast were covered with dust, but the waitress said, \"it is normal\" (is it, really?!). I can't say that their coffee is super-good either.  The other food was tasty, and the terrace is nice. Still, never again: there are many more places in Plateau and Mile End with yummy food and beautiful terraces but where the staff is friendly and the food isn't dirty."}
{"text":"Cosy cafe with a launderette..French owner prepares delicious sandwiches , soup , cakes.."}
{"text":"I love this place. Unpretentious, yummy food, fresh croissants and good tea selection. The vibe is chill and the back patio is enchanting. Great place to study or read."}
{"text":"Café et buanderie, terrasse à l'arriere où des concerts intimes se presentent des fois. Petite restauration raisonable. Propio français. Endroit vieillot avec du cachet populaire."}
