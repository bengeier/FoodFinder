{"text":"The nacho chips, guacamole and cheese dip were our favourite. 

Pulled pork, fish and bulgogi tacos were all just ok. 

The space is nice and fits with the King West atmosphere. Seating is \"community\" style (shared tables). You place your order and grab a seat when it becomes available."}
{"text":"The fish taco is really good. 

Burrito boys makes the best burritos this place... WAY too much bread ratio not enough of anything else. 

The other meat tacos  not good meat tastes more like old leftovers from earlier that week. Lol gross. 

TIP: if your going only get fish tacos"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, quick service.

The pineapple salsa from the salsa bar is the best."}
{"text":"May be the best hard tacos in the city. Grand Electric has solid soft tacos but I find I always crave Wilbur more. Burritos are super fresh and better than Fat Bastard or Burrito Boyz by a long shot. 
The carne asadas, chicken tingas, and bulgogis are stellar. The baja fish is a generous portion of fish. Everything just tastes very fresh and I've never had a bad experience there. Sometimes the wait can be a little long if you're eating there but I've never been there when its not busy. 
Love that you can grab as many dips and salsas you want at the salsa bar which is quite extensive. The pico de gallo is always a nice addition in my opinion. 
Don't be discouraged by how Americanized/Canadianized the logo and the building looks. Tastes pretty authentic Mexican to me..."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quality, quick Mexican meal.  Salsa bar is awesome and guac is made fresh- very good.  I had the chicken taco (hard shell).  Very good but the hard tacos are a little small. I only ordered one and should have ordered two!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! I always go here whenever I want Mexican food. A really cute place, staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. Once I was in line and a man behind me (normal guy but seemed a bit tipsy. Still managed to act properly though) started talking to me. I wasn't interested but I still talked a bit just to be nice. A worker noticed and asked if I was okay and if the guy was bothering me at all, which I thought was so sweet. Their staff really cares! An amazing place."}
{"text":"Everything from the decor to the staff and of course the food is on point at Wilbur. 

Colleague and I went in for lunch last week, we arrived at noon and seemed to just miss the rush (by 12:30 there was a lineup to order). We were greeted at the door by a really nice guy who asked if we had been to the restaurant before, we said no, and he walked us through the menu and ordering system. You order at the front counter, get a number and sit anywhere. 

Our food was brought to us within 5min! We split the guacamole and queso and each had 2 tacos as well. The guacamole was so fresh, to my taste it could have been a bit spicier but the queso offset that as it had some nice heat to it. I thoroughly enjoyed both. It's worth noting you do get a nice handful of chips with the tacos so we ended up with quite a lot of chips - very filling! For my tacos I had the bulgogi beef (with sriracha cream, pear, cabbage, and sesame seeds), and the pork (with pickled red onion, jalapeno-cilantro crema, and cotija cheese). 

The meats were so delicious and well cooked and the toppings really complimented the whole thing. Neither had any real heat to them but that is preferable in a place where the salsa and hot sauce selections are endless. I gave the ghost pepper salsa a try - do not fear it is tolerable but definitely hot, and the salsa verde was another fave. 

Throughout our visit we were checked on twice by a very helpful employee. I think this place will be around for awhile, and I'll be back very soon! Excited to try those brisket taquitos!"}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican fast food. Not cheap. Food was served cold. Tortilla shells tasted like MC'D's flour tortillas. Worst pico de gallo I have ever tasted. The tomatoes were grainy and unripened. No Mexican would ever step foot in that place. Hot sauces are gimmicky.  Some very nice employees though. Everyone working there is smiling.

Would not go again."}
{"text":"I thought the tacos were OK. I like that each order comes with tasty tortilla chips and there was a salsa bar and tons of hot sauces to pick from. 

I came here on a Friday night and it was really busy. There were probably 4 people in line in front of me and it didn't seem like the line died down the whole time I was there. I ordered my food, took my numbered sign, and we were able to find a spot for 2. I had the chicken tinga, carne asada and the baja fish tacos. I liked the fish taco the most and tasted the corn which was good, but altogether everything was average. I'd prefer to go to La Carnita, Seven Lives, Burrito Boyz, and Grand Electric in comparison. 

Although I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, it's in a good location and I would still come back if a friend wanted to try it out or meet there."}
{"text":"My wife loves chipotle. I love trying something new. This was an in between for the both of us. Very similar to chipotle yet had its own style. The food was great! It was super busy(not from a big city here) but every place was like this in Toronto. Would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"amazing! great decor, fast friendly service, clean modern setting, great vibe. the food reasonably priced and incredibly delicious!!!! bulging taco was a hit! I will most definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and quick service for a Saturday evening. Great quick bite. Had the chicken quesadilla. Not too cheesy or greasy! Clean washroom facility as well for a quick paced eatery."}
{"text":"Great food with fast and friendly service. Enjoyed everything we ordered. Guac was good and you can't go wrong with the corn. I like the food here better than La Carnita. The tacos are way better. Avocado and fish tacos were the best. Love the self serve hot sauce and salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Service - (Very good) for a casual dining place the service and ambiance was top notch. 

Food - (Good) the tacos were tasty but nothing special. Among the Baja fish, steak and Korean bulgogi options my favorite was surprisingly the bulgogi. 

Condiments - (Excellent) this is what makes this place standout from your other taco joints and what saved my rather bland Baja fish taco. They have an open salsa bar with an array of salsas ranging from the simple pico de gallo to a wicked ghost pepper concoction that will make you sweat. While I like my spices I found their chipotle mix to have the perfect balance of scoville hotness and flavor. If that's not enough they have a shelf full of third party hot sauces to add more flavor. 

Their prices are reasonable and their open salsa bar will draw me back next time but they seriously need to improve on the basics like their Baja fish and guacamole if they expect to win over die hard taco fans. Overall a good place to check out if you are in the area but don't expect to be completely blown away by the food, the salsa tho are in a league of their own."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my banker. I thought, \"OK, the guy handling my money says to spend money there. So this must be legit\". And upon that thinking I tried out this restaurant a few blocks past spadina, West on King street. 

First off, the way you order is very much like freshii (clipboard style). Once you give your order, you are provided with a strange metal order inductor that you bring with you to your table or seating of choice). 

So while you wait for your food, I encourage waltzing (perhaps not in actuality) to the unlimited salsa bar. And try the different salsa. The expression of the cartoon fellow above the sauce name suggest the hotness of the salsa. 

The quesadilla was great, the shrimps were well cooked and the overall crunchiness of the qursadilla was what I enjoyed, and it went well into my hands.  The accompaniment of house made guacamole and sour cream was good as well.  

Will go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! That's the kind of restaurant I want to keep going to. Fair prices, good food, good service and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! First time we got take-out and have dined in a couple of times. Thought it would be blandish, over-priced - but no - I was wrong! 

PROS: 

Real nacho chips that taste amazing. 
The guac, queso and chips is very good - my favorite. The cheese is addictive, well-sized proportion. 
They are pretty quick - but the place is packed now. 
Communal sitting (kind of, if you are smaller group, you need to share). 
I love that you can pick and choose your own sauces and salsa. There is a wide variety to suit your hot factor and variety. This is a big plus for me as I am very picky when it comes to sauces and like how you can test them out to find what you prefer. 
Veggie and gluten free options. 
Chips with taco - didn't realize so had too much food the first time. 

CONS: 

I wasn't a fan of the vegetarian mango something taco. There is limited choice for veggie / gluten free - but enough to find something. In the take-out time it was also soggy and not that great. 

UPDATE: the tortilla chips are fried in battered fish - so if you are celiac they are not safe. The queso isn't either. If you want a kale salad - that's all you can really get here it seems."}
{"text":"A really really good experience here at Wilbur. Friendly staff greeting everyone once they enter, decent prices. 

The salsas absolutely stole the show. The chips and guac for $4.50 is a relative steal in Toronto, and was tangy and flavourful. 

I tried three different options at the salsa bar and came away impressed with all of them. 

The Baja fish tacos were soft and flavourful, as was the chicken tinga. 

Decor and vibe are on point. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Since Valdez was full with a 30min wait, came to this joint a couple of wks ago on a Sat. We actually weren't sure if it was even open yet to the public since the brown papers still covered the glass walls. But, we pulled opened the door anyway and tried. There weren't too many ppl in the place yet so there wasn't a long wait. Service was lagging a bit but the staff was still in training, as taped on the front glass door.
But, they were great otherwise. No rudeness or attitude so far.
Will have to check back and see in a few months if things change. This place is a much trendier and hippier version of Chipotle but not like Chipotle, if that makes any sense.

Food was awesome. You love spicy and hot, you'll find the sauce in this place. They have quite a collection. Some of them are funny. I love love their chips - their nachos. I asked about it and was told it was freshly made there. I recommend the taquitos and corn. My appetite was satisfied on just those alone. 

Place is liquor licensed. They have a few selection of latin/SA beers like Tecate. They played old school and current rnb, hiphop from what I can remember. Vibe was good. 
Self-service at the time I went, not sure if this has changed since now that they are fully open and operational. Price is good considering it's on King St and in the midst of other exp restos and bars. Hopefully their prices don't change.

Great awesome new place on King. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Can we just take a moment and taco 'bout this place on King West?

As a self-proclaiming taco-lover, I have seen way too many pictures on social media for me to not head over and try it myself. We came on a Friday night (late though, around 8:30pm) and it was quite packed.

The first thing we got was the guac and chips. Wowz, let's just say we both loved them. We couldn't talk for a while cause we were both busy munching away.
 The chips were thick-ish and warm, while the guac was just a bunch of smashed up avocados with nothing else. (y) amaze. 

I ordered three tacos.
- Chicken Tinga | pulled chicken with guacamole and cotija cheese on a cripsy corn tortilla
- Pork | pulled pork, pickled red onion, jalapeno-cilantro crema, and cotija cheese in flour tortilla
- Baja Fish | beer battered mahi-mahi, cabbage, pico de gallo, and chiptole creme in a corn tortilla 

All three were absolutely delicious. I normally do not enjoy hard shelled tacos but the chicken one was my favorite! It could also be due to the fact that it had guac but still bomb. The sauces on the other two were also really good. I've had better tacos but I still enjoyed these."}
{"text":"I had discovered Wilbur not too long ago on Instagram so I had decided to check it out. Most definitely a choice I did not regret! The food was fresh and served quickly in a very comfortable environment. I ordered the chicken tinga which tasted slightly different from what I am used to but nevertheless delicious. I will most definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great concept - decent food, but they really should consider a \"daily special\" to change up the menu a little.

I go often because it's close by. Shrimp and Shroom Quesadilla is my go to... a little greasy sometimes, but that's ok with me most of the time. 

I would revisit the guac' recipe. Not really memorable for the right reasons...."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't impressed by the ordering structure, but it turned out to be easy enough in the end. The food was pretty good and prices were fair. Pretty cool atmosphere. If I could sum up what I thought of this place it would be, very King West. Not what you would expect from a proper Mexican place but a Mexican place with a \"Canadianized\" menu and more of a King West vibe. All in all, it was good based on expectations."}
{"text":"Its expensive for what is essentially dressed up street food. Almost always a huge line up. Other than that, most people seem to enjoy it. Me? Meh."}
{"text":"Really great space to grab a quick, delicious bite! Prices are quite reasonable, especially for the King West area. Tacos aren't as good as Seven Lives, but the seating, great service, awesome salsas made in house give it a few extra points. Super speedy service if you're just getting the tacos. The shrimp and mushroom quesadilla is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Been several times and never disappointed! Always a line up, but the wait is short. Cashiers are efficient and helpful with menu which is not overly complex. Think basic Mexican - tried chicken and steak burritos they also have a tasty veg kale salad. Food is always fresh, hot and delicious even after take out. Got my office and friends hooked on this spot. They always get my multiple orders correct (sometimes up to 8ppl). What I love most is the side of nacho chips with your order. Also, the vast display of hot sauces, and salsas as condiment options (my fav is the pineapple mix). You can tell these owners really know what they're doing. Price point is fair considering location and quality ($10 for burrito). Im betting that in the near future a second location will ensue. For now, I cant wait till they start serving tequila but ill definitely still enjoy a cold beer and will continue to recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I've been to Wilbur for a number of different occasions: after Jays games, for dinner, for lunch, etc, and the common denominator is that it's always an excellent choice! Regardless of how long the line is, it always move efficiently and the food always comes out quickly. Everything I've tried on the menu has been awesome, and the hot sauce bar is a genius touch."}
{"text":"I'm from the States, so I'm well aware of what good Mexican food is.  And I was somewhat skeptical it could happen in Canada after my previous experiences.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Wilbur Mexicana was a quality taqueria.  The food was fresh, and there was a decent variety of tacos, burritos, and the standard fare.  They weren't as spicy as I had come to expect from the menu (maybe that's a Canadian thing), but that was easily resolved by the hundreds of hot sauces available.  

On the downside, the line can go out the door during the lunch rush hour.  It didn't seem like they were processing customers as fast as they could.  Also, the layout isn't conducive to a lot of people eating-in:  There are a number of huge community tables but they are not efficiently used by the customers, nor efficiently placed by the designer.  Finding a seat may be a challenge during lunch.  These all resulted in just a single point deduction.  Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend Wilbur Mexicana as a good taqueria for a casual bite."}
{"text":"Could easily be the BEST Mexican food in the city! Love their chips and guac! Their beef fajitas are to die for! Try their salads or burrito bowls if you're looking for a lighter option. The atmosphere is casual and modern. They have a large selection of hot sauces!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for mediocre food. Came here because of the high ratings and endless reviews raving about how good the food was. The guacamole had HUGE pieces of cilantro in it and my Baja fish taco had an off taste.. like it was sitting in the oil for too long. The chicken tinga was okay although I wish they didn't put so much guac on top. The only thing that was actually really good was surprisingly the corn. Cheese and sauce that came on it was amazing. Overall experience wasn't terrible but nothing special especially for such a high price."}
{"text":"In town for business and needed a quick bite. Being a California native and resident, I was a little skeptical as to how good the Mexican faire would be in Canada. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Wilbur. The food was really good. Great vegetarian options. My order came out hot and quick and best of all the vibe and atmosphere was very casual and inviting."}
{"text":"Loved the casual atmosphere and wooden tables. They have longer communal tables and I thought that was unique. Great selection of sauces to try. Most of them were very spicy, and I was glad I got the guac.

Delicious tacos. Pineapples were a nice touch to mine. The tacos already come with the chips (I had no idea), so I think I'll try the corn next time!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the guacamole and Mexican corn. Tacos are ok,  pineapple salsa is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is just O.K. A little too over-hyped and not as flavourful as authentic Mexican food. Also, keep in mind that this is set up as a fast food joint with dining restaurant prices."}
{"text":"Great concept, great food. Ventured here after a day at Centre Island, craving tacos. I was disappointed that the only gluten free taco they have is the pork. I ordered one (it was delicious) plus a burrito bowl (HUGE and delicious) but all together way too much food. All their other meats (chicken, beef, fish) are marinated in or battered with wheat so I was limited to pork.

Would return for the pork taco."}
{"text":"Amazing spot!! The  inside is so clean and very bright!! Food is delicious, and capicola sandwich is amazing!! Will return!! Also get a groupon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, lovely space and atmosphere and over all a decent joint. The communal seating is a bit of knocker. It took us a very long time to settle down to a seat because a bunch of inconsiderate people took up larger tables with their bags and refused to share. It made it awkward to stand around and wait especially considering the size of the place and the number of chairs. They have a pretty fast turn-around so we eventually did find seats but to all those people who would just share your table, that would be great. The place definitely functions like a cafeteria, which I am not a fan of.

The quesadillas were very good and held up on it's own without falling apart. The fish taco was okay and could use a bit more seasoning but the brisket taquitos were the best out of it all. The meat was tender and moist and the exterior had a good crunch to it. It was, as most people mentioned, the highlight of the menu. 

Ultimately, I think my review is a bit skewed because of the seating arrangement. I would rate the food 4 out of 5, which means I'll come back to to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with some friends. I really enjoyed the atmosphere there. 

Tacos were good, I had the carne asada one. Would have preferred if they made them with corn tortillas because that's more authentic. I was glad they also came with some nacho chips, which you can dip into one or a few of their large selection of salsas. I didn't try to bulgogi taco, but I was surprised they had it. 

Service was super fast, I'm impressed. Price is kinda ok, I guess. 

All in all, a great experience and would recommend it for taco lovers like me."}
{"text":"Chips are good, not too salty in taste and the guacamole is one of the best that I've ever had. The shrimp and mushroom one is soooooo tasty that everyone was craving it! For the fajitas, we ordered the chicken and beef one at first then add a shrimp one as we are craving the shrimp, the shrimp one is way better than the beef and chicken one, while the other one is not so good with the other version I used to had in other places. The kale salad is in the normal standard while the portion is good. Their salsa bar is the biggest reason for me to come back for times! Loving the atmosphere and efficiency they have!"}
{"text":"Guac is really good, not stingy on it too which is nice! Fish taco was delish, the guac taco wasn't what I expected but it wasn't bad.  Will definitely be going back to try the burritos.  Also big plus for the spice bar, very cool"}
{"text":"Awesome food but sloooowww service.

Takes a very long time to line up just to order your food, and when you want another beer, you gotta line up again which is kinda dumb.

Gotta fix this :)"}
{"text":"What a great new spot on King W! I was pleasantly surprised with their prices - everything is very affordable and you get amazing value for money. 

I usually start with their Guacamole and chips. You get generous serving of fresh delicious guacamole for only $4 (compare to ~$10 elsewhere). They have one of a kind salsa bar with fresh salsas, I think there use be at least 8 varieties, in all spice levels. Their salsa bar will sure satisfy any taste. My personal favorite is pineapple salsa - I can literally have it on its own, delish!

My favourite is beef fajitas - a generous serving of thinly sliced sizzling beef, accompanied by soft tortillas, guacamole, lettuce and other usual trimmings. 

For the healthy peeps out there - I recommend trying their kale salad, you can ago a topping of protein to it. Yum!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! Great for soft tacos. The perfect size and not overly filling. I recommend the carne asada and chicken tinga."}
{"text":"Wow!

I love tacos, they are a fun food and easy way to get a lot of variety in one meal.  What I love most about this place is that all the tacos are customizable.  I had the Chicken and fish, and also tried my friend's chicken fajita.  No words on the flavour.  You also get a side of nachos.  But the best part for me was the salsa bar.  You can choose what you want to eat your tacos with, and also the endless choice of hot sauces.

This is by no means a fine dining restaurant, but for a taco joint, it is the best I've had.  That's why they get 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've had in the city - definitely a must try if you haven't been here already. Loved the steak tacos, perfect amount of crunch, sauce and meat. Ordered about 3 of these, good size super filling and not too expensive. Really cool concept and exceptionally friendly staff! will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican place. Consistently very good food and good service. I just wish they were open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've passed by and seen the line-ups.  NOW I get why!

Finally braved the line-up to try out Wilbur this weekend.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be an off-night for their cash system which was down, so things felt a little chaotic.   It was cash only, which turned some people away.  I'm not sure if usually you go up to the counter to order, but this night, two people went around the lines taking orders and givng us our order number.  Then we waited to get to the cash, where we were told to repeat our orders while they used their calculators on their phones to charge us.  No receipts were available. 

(As an aside, this was totally an honour system.  One could've easily gotten away with not mentioning an item ordered and there'd be no tracking, if one was not an honest person!  Of course, with my bad luck, I realized (after I got home) that I was OVER-charged...maybe a typo on the calculator?  It was only a few bucks, so no harm, I suppose.)

With two of us eating, while I waited in line to pay, the other took up a table that had just been vacated and cleaned, to ensure we had seats, and promptly displayed our order number.  (On observation, seats turned over quickly, so I think even solo diners should not have trouble finding a spot to sit down.)  Even before I paid, the first order already arrived although we only got guac when we ordered (and paid for) guac and queso fundido.  This was quickly rectified.  Again, this may have been due to their system being down?

Anyway, onto what's important...the food!  Actually I'm not sure I can add that much more to what others have already said.  Everything was SO delicious.  Of note is the fact that their guac does NOT have tomatos, which I prefer.  The queso fundido was so good, I was tempted to drink it like soup.  And the Mexican street corn - the bomb!  Their pineapple salsa is delicious, and the various hot sauces were so fun to try.

Also ordered were tacos (bulgogi and baja fish) and the S&T bowl.  The latter was super generous in shrimps (I counted 6 good-sized shrimps) and brisket.  I could not finish the bowl considering the amount of appetizers we had.  

I have already made plans to go back to Wilbur and hopefully I will see how efficiently the ordering process runs when the computers are up and working!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan but there are a few things they can improve.
Ordered several types of tacos.  Love the chicken tinga because of the crunchy shell.  The shell held up well to its contents, didn't shatter in my hands after taking a bite and tasted great too.  We'd definitely come back for this.  The carne asada was nice with the crispy onions, the bulgogi had the cabbage which provided a nice contrast.  Baja Fish was decent too.  The shrimp and mushroom quesadilla was satisfyiing too; good flavor and nice, thin shell although it could use a bit more shrimp.
What could be improved:  was looking forward to the Mexican Street Corn.  The 'sauce' was good but the corn was so small and thin.  Each bite was not satisfying enough as the corn wasn't as big as what you'd see in grocery stores so there just wasn't enough of it.  So sauce to corn ratio was almost like 2:1 or 3:1.
Salsa bar wasn't as good as what we'd had in Texas and San Diego.  The salsa wasn't tart or flavourful enough.  Salsa has to be done right as this is the most basic one.  I think I make a better one at home.  And sorry, one commenter said the salsa bar was innovative.  No it's not as salsa bars are common in Mexican restaurants in Texas and San Diego.
Of course the most common nuisance in restaurants is the lack of noise reduction.  When the walls are all glass windows, I had to shout to the person across from me to be heard.

Over all though, we'd go back for the chicken tinga taco.  And if their corn is bigger, I'd get that again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 stars for the corn alone!!! honestly just come and eat the corn its worth it! 

the chips and guac was good the guac i found to be too much avocado and not enough everything else. The chips were good with the sauce bar nice way to taste all the different sauces. the sauces themselves tasted homemade and fresh.

the original wilbur rito was not good in my opinion it was the most expensive single item we ordered and it was just a waste of your money which you could have used to order something more tasty.

the tacos were good I had pork and mushroom, I love meat but I actually prefered the mushroom over the pork.   

overall the food was good but it didn't really have much spice which I think is smart because then you can spice it up yourself and use the extensive hot sauce selection they have up.

I will be back for that corn."}
{"text":"Solid performer for my lunch crew. This place runs like a well oiled machine.  The food is excellent, very reasonably priced and served quickly.  Not the best Mexican I've had (I argue you have to hit Mexico for that), but it's solid."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking out Wilbur Mexicana.  When I walked in I loved the decor and the ambiance.  After spending a few more minutes in there I realized how busy this place was.   The menus were hung up on the side which was kind of interesting, but also kind of strange.  We ended up ordering two tacos each and then sharing chips and guac with a cheesey dip.  I suppose the actual name would be more helpful, but I cannot remember at the moment.  The water in the vodka bottles is hilarious, and I was really looking forward to that salsa bar.  Unfortunately I didn't really enjoy any of the salsas.  I was actually wondering what was wrong with me, as I love a good salsa bar, but none of these salsas really did it for me.  The beef taco I had was good, but the pork one was just okay.  The busyness of the place also made it hard to really sit and enjoy your food.  We could see a line up out the door and people looking around for place to sit.  We ended up giving up our seats so others could enjoy their meal, and taking our chips and guac to go.  All in all, I like the concept, but I don't think I will hurry back to this place."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Wilbur Mexican yesterday and I must say we over ordered. We had the chips with Guac and Queso jalepeno dip, two orders of corn and two tacos each. It was way too much. It would have been better to share 1 corn order and hit the salsa bar w the chips that come w your tacos. The service was really fast. We were seated for less than 5 min b4 all our food orders came out. And this was in the height of the rush hour lunch w a lineup out the door.  All dishes were on pt. Will keep going back again and again. Glad Wilbur moved to our hood!"}
{"text":"Upsides:
- Clean
- Bright
- Plenty of seating
- Decorated nicely but looks like it should be a barber shop, not a restaurant.
- Fresh ingredients
- Soda Fountain
- Salsa Bar

Downsides
- Too many staff greeting people at the door
- Too many staff in the kitchen standing around
- Kitchen is too small to accommodate the amount of diners
- Menu design makes it difficult to read quickly

I'm sure I'll come up with a few other things but my rating is based more on the fact that my burrito was ok at best. It tasted exactly like a burrito you would get from Chipotle, which is just sad. I had a baja fish burrito and if I didn't see the fish in the burrito, I wouldn't have known there was any in it. It was flavourless and boring.

I didn't get a chance to hit up the salsa bar which is obviously the reason why people think the food tastes good. Everything tastes better when you slather it with a more powerful, better tasting sauce.

If you're looking for a burrito that tastes just like Chipotle or Zteca, then go to Chipotle or Zteca if you happen to be closer to them. If not, Wilbur will fill the sameness gap."}
{"text":"Mexican street corn and their quasadillas are AMAZING. Love this place. Service is awesome. Food is always amazing. And it has a great vibe."}
{"text":"Really liked the vibe at this place and their vast selection of sauces. I enjoyed the guacamole and chips.  My favourite taco was the chicken tinga and the bulgogi was pretty good too. However, the fish taco was super soggy and just not good.
I would probably come back here, since it's conveniently located but I think there are much better options elsewhere in the city for tacos!"}
{"text":"Very busy place, but it was really easy to find a seat. Ordered nachos with guac and melted cheese to share which was really nice, but the tacos had a side of chips which we didn't know so there was a lot of chips. I tried the chicken taco which only has the option of the hard taco and the bulgogi soft taco which had very thick pieces of meat and also the baja fish taco which was my favourite."}
{"text":"Don't see what the big fuss is about Wilbur, my second time here, had the burrito the first time (per my husband's recommendation). I would had given that a 3-star as well. 

My friend really liked Wilbur and so we met here again and this time I got the Shrimp Fajitas, there was no \"pepper\" next to any menu items to indicate that it was spicy. I doubt I'm the only one who wish they would include that. 

Their pineapple salsa from the bar is my favourite. 

Their line moves pretty quickly for ordering. It's waiting for the food that could take about 15 minutes in the heart of lunch rush."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the neighbourhood given quick service, low price and quality food. You won't get the best taco or burrito in the city here, but everything I tried was good. You place your order, sit down, and they bring it to your table. Food was delivered quickly and everyone was quite friendly. There's a large get your own salsa bar but the three I tried weren't too exciting. The space is nicely lit and works well for take-out or dine in. It's a solid place in the area for affordable Mexican."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked to try Wilbur because Toronto has a significant lack of high quality street style Mexican. I really wanted to like this place, but must admit it was pretty average - especially for the price. 

I had 2x fish taco, 1x carne taco.

My taco tortillas were barely intact and the fish didn't taste fresh, nor was there very much.

I'll probably still go back because it's great service, and hopefully this was an isolated incident. Plus there aren't many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Since moving from Los Angeles to Toronto I will say this is the closest to good Mexican food I have had. In addition their salsa bar and the hot sauce choices are absolutely amazing,all though they don't have Tapatio :("}
{"text":"Been a few times awesome environment , great and friendly staff, AMAZING food.. my favourite iz the classic quesadilla.. salsa bar is amazing !"}
{"text":"I really like this place. They're a bit pricey for the portions (King St tax) but the food and service are both good and their salsa bar is unique and awesome! Give this a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"So good!  Staff are consistently friendly and helpful.  You don't have to wait a long time for the food and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"For those that stress out about finishing their salsa long before the chips are done, fear no more at Wilbur! Their self serve salsa bar is awesome with plenty of options to suit any taste. The Pico De Gallo was fantastic and I could really taste the fresh ingredients. 

Aside from the salsa bar, food highlights were the CHIPS, GUACAMOLE, AND QUESO FUNDIDO ( must try!) and Baja Taco- the fish was not overly battered and a decent portion. 

Service was very quick, efficient and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food- really really great.  Hispter Haven though- but brought my kids here and didn't get any looks but not sure I would say this is a \"family\" place...  Service was friendly.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Wilbur Mexicana has the best chips and guacamole that I've ever had. \"Guac is extra?\" Not here, where guac comes in heaping portions next to crunchy and tasty chips. I think about them often. 

The atmosphere at Wilbur is awesome; the art on the walls showcases their levels of spice that you can get in your meal and they were playing fun, alternative music when I dined there, lending to the atmosphere. I had a salad, which is not typical Mexican food fare, but it was delicious with grilled pineapple and roasted, spicy chickpeas. My friend had a burrito 'the size of her face' and loved it. Service was friendly and casual.

An excellent place for lunch in a great location. And those chips, goodness, those chips."}
{"text":"So happy because I found my new go to place to eat. The hot sauces and salsa bar is pretty impressive. I had my food to go and it did not disappoint. I had quesadillas and 2 tacos. Wow usually Mexican food is not one of my fav until today. The staff is friendly and helpful. No wonder this place is always packed. Great food coupled with great service will win each and every time. 
I'm going back tomorrow because I want to try the burrito. It looked yummy."}
{"text":"Some good food! I reco the beef tacos - both kinds.  There's an opportunity here for them to make this more of a sit down and drink spot if they change it up a bit. Only gripe is that it's not comfortable. It's an eat and leave in 20 mins spot, with the space not to be."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite lunch spots. Everything I've ordered has been excellent, and I love the fresh salsa bar. The space is great, and they're always playing great music. 

My only real complaint is that every couple of times, the fish taco is over cooked. It also gets pretty busy sometimes, but that's expected. I wish I could give it a 4.5!"}
{"text":"Soo good!
Food is great and so are the forks that work there... Very welcome and the place is packed so get there early.
Love the selection of all kinds of sauces and add on's... And you can even have a beer :)
I'd try this place anytime."}
{"text":"Two visits in five days, they must be doing something good for me to come back so soon.

It was a Sunday around 5:30ish and the place was less than half full which was great as I had a choice to sit anywhere I wanted and only one person in line ahead of me.  

Service was friendly, fast and efficient like the first visit, but I think the staff may have recognized me as the lady that took many photos.  Indeed, I took more photos because why not?  The place wasn't busy, I had a clear view of the salsas and hot sauces (which I forgot to photographed during my first visit).

Only ordered the chicken tinga and the carne asada as I wanted to try the steak taco again.  The carne asada was better this time around as it was flavourful, but the chicken was a bit bland tasting and came out cold (or was that how it's supposed to be served? Cold chicken?).

Thank goodness for all the salsas available to add flavour to the tacos.  I have to admit, the salsas are tasty especially the pineapple one (still my favourite).  I almost went for seconds to just eat salsa on its own, but opted not to because that just wouldn't feel right.

For my  next visit, I vowed to myself I'll try the burritos or quesadillas or fajitas, anything else but the tacos since I have to give the other foods a chance for me to sample."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tinga, pork, fish and bulgogi. Everything was great but didn't like the bulgogi. It was overcooked and was like a jerky.
The best part of this place is the complimentary Salsa bar and hot sauce selection (probably 100 different types).  Tacos come with a bunch of chips which go perfectly with the Salsa.  The Salsa isn't fantastic but there is a nice variety (corn and bean, pineapple, regular and a few others).

I also love it when they have water you can pour yourself. 

Nice spot on King Street. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"my go to when i need a burrito. dat salsa bar gives me life."}
{"text":"Delicious food but slow when preparing orders for delivery."}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say about Wilbur. I went in, a hungry, naive fellow in the midst of a busy work day, and in need of a quick take-out bite. Little did I know I'd be walking out with a bag full of the most glorious and fresh food this side of town had to offer. 

I ordered three fish tacos, thinking two wouldn't be enough. Ha, what an idiot. I was given my number, lucky 11, and took a seat at the handy and efficient take out bar stools, reserved for exactly this situation. 

The people in front of me were given their food before me. They didn't get take out. They sat in a booth. I watched as the waiter brought their food to their table. I swear he was floating like an angel. An angel with Mexican food. And then it happened. My food came.

The woman tried to get the container into the plastic bag but kind of fumbled. She laughed and said, \"I always have trouble with this!\" After exchanging a chuckle and a thanks, I walked out the door, unaware of the tastebud voyage I was about to embark on. 

When I got back to work, I opened the container and to my surprise found quite a bounty of fish tacos. They looked incredible. I took a bite and the crunch of the fish felt wild between my teeth. But the wild ride didn't end there. It only got wilder. 

Every bite was flavour explosion. I swear I could taste the sea. So fresh, wow. 

I love Wilbur and I will be back.

Maybe next time I will try a different item on the menu. The Wilburito has a name that made me giggle."}
{"text":"The California burrito is out of this world!! I ordered the chicken tinga taco once, it was a bit dry for my liking. I love the self serving salsa bar."}
{"text":"We ordered the guacamole, 2 fish tacos and the shrimp fajitas. Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were very generous, had more than enough for leftovers. My favourite thing though had to be the salsa and hot sauce bar. I can't think of any other place I've been to that offered such an amazing selection."}
{"text":"Lots of choices on their menu, and all at reasonable prices. Everything I had was extremely tasty, love the fact that all orders come with a side of tortilla chips. Gives you the chance to go nuts at their salsa bar, multiple choices to choose from with that. The location is great for those late night bites, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Slow if you're in a rush... But they have some pretty mean fajitas.

They've spent a bunch of dough turning the space into something very visually appealing. The salsa bar is great (especially the pineapple) and they are licensed, as well.

If you decide you want to order more (say an extra taco), you've got to line up again and get a new number (which means you may have several numbers on your table) which seems a bit silly instead of just being able to either add to your current order (or heaven forbid...order from the table!)"}
{"text":"Drove an hour to get here and was not dissapointed!! Ive been to several mexican restaurants in the city and this one was truly amazing! Service is great, the tacos and street corn are full of flavour, and the salsa bar is a super unique way to add some heat to your meal ! I cant wait to come back. 10/10"}
{"text":"Wilbur is a hip and happening Mexican spot on King.  It's got a modern feel with quirky elements such as Edison lights softened with science beakers as light fixtures.
It's an elevated fast food experience where you order at the counter but food is served to you at your table.  Highlight:  A vast selection of self-serve hot sauces and salsa bar featuring favorites such as pico de gallo and black bean!  Needs improvement: A subpar Mexican Street Corn - inconsistent in its delivery due to its uneven char, lack of flavour and dressing. Tacos are priced competitively but are also quite average."}
{"text":"Great tacos I usually get the steak and Pork tacos and they give you some nachos to munch on in your basket. You order the food at the front when you walk in and they give you a number you then find a seat and thy bring you the goods. They have plenty of salsa to try as well :)"}
{"text":"I'm not one to ever crave burritos but seeing the rather unorthodox decor for a burrito place made me want to try Wilbur Mexicana.  A friendly server greeted us when we walked in and showed us to the cash counter to place our order. He also explained that we could help ourselves to the salsa bar as we waited. I ordered the Cali burrito (which came with a small side of tortilla chips) and as I waited, I helped myself to an abundant selection of salsas. I tried 4 different salsas - pico de galo, pineapple, chipotle and asada - all tasted great with fresh ingredients. The burrito itself was delicious. Tightly wrapped with no ingredients falling out as you bit into it (don't you hate it when that happens?). The sweet potato in the burrito added a unique flavour to an otherwise mostly savoury/slightly spicy burrito. My husband wanted a burrito bowl and they were able to accommodate this by putting all the ingredients in a container with 4 mini soft taco wraps on the side. 

Overall, a great experience here. We did takeout but would love to come back for a casual sit down meal."}
{"text":"I came here on a chilly afternoon seeking refugee.

i started with the Guacamole and chips $4.50. The serving was quite generous more than enough for 2 -3 people
I ordered the Baja fish taco and Bulgogi taco, both delicious and reasonably priced. 
Boy oh boy  try one of their many  hot sauces and you'll be guaranteed  to experience hot flashes.

They have a variety of salsas that will  add some \"SABOR \" to your day. 
Staff is super laid back but attentitve.
The room itsel is spacious and decorated in a modern and minimalistic way. 
I'll be sure to come back to try more of their yummy tacos."}
{"text":"Found Wilbur on Yelp. Affordable and delicious Mexican food. Busy and always fresh. Order your food and find a table. Guacamole was excellent! Lime Margarita very good as well. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a large group from work for what I think was opening day. The service was excellent and the food was very well priced considering the area. 

The ordering process is fine except for the odd decision to hang menus by the door but have none up on the wall. I have a feeling I'll be there for a corona and taco pretty regularly after work. 

The salsa selection is an obvious attraction and while most of my coworkers had the tacos my Wilbur burrito was excellent. Sure it could have been spicier but with a massive selection of hot sauce and salsas freely available I just took a sampling. 

The tacos were very good but not spectacular. If you're on the hunt for that there are nicer places. However,  this place hits a great combination of price, location, and space that is hard to come by."}
{"text":"YUM! Ok so you order first at the front counter, they have beer and fruity drinks! After ordering they give you a little sign with a number and bring the food to you. But wait! Make sure to get napkins and one of their many salsas/hot sauces! Now you're good to go. ?"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Mexican food.  The fillings of the tacos were flavourful and the portion was just enough..my favourite was their bulgogi taco.  Their guac is really tasty!  The salsa bar is also a great idea - my favourite is their pineapple salsa.  

The place can get quite crowded on a Saturday night - we wandered the restaurant for about 10-15 minutes to find some seats - so I'd suggest finding some seats before ordering your food."}
{"text":"Being from California (San Diego aka Mexico) I'm not going to knock their authenticity as it's clearly not but I can absolutely appreciate what they're doing.

We ordered chips with guac (best guac I've had I Toronto thus far) which were really good with fresh made chips. I got the avocado taco and a fish taco. My first major gripe is the pink sauce they put on their tacos; it's absolutely terrible. Upon first bite I got the distinct taste of being put under anesthesia with cherry flavoured gas. I'm dead serious, this is exactly what this sauce tastes like and is unappetizing at best. After wiping that off of both my tacos I really enjoyed them.

I used to get a lot of teeth pulled when I was a kid...hence the being very familiar with cherry gas..."}
{"text":"Everything from the food to music is dope here. Totally recommend it for anytime of the day. Great place."}
{"text":"Wilbur Mexican is a quick, relatively cheap and cheerful spot for made to order Mexican food. I've eaten in a few times, and gotten take out as well. Both options hold up quite well. Literally, take out tacos sometimes involve soaked through shells and these stand their ground to even the most gooey toppings. 

You definitely cannot miss the Mexican corn. It is cheesy, corny, grilled and spiced goodness that doesn't quit. I also like ordering the grilled avocado taco, since it feels super fresh. flavourful and light, without sacrificing anything. Other standout tacos for me have been the Baja fish taco and chicken tinga, which comes in a crispy shell. Kinda nice to get some shell variety. Guacamole and chips have always been welcome as sidepieces to the meal. 

Let it be known and remembered, if you remember anything from this review, that the salsa bar alone gets 5 STARS. There are plenty of housemade fresh salsas like pico de gallo and a mango salsa, and there is also a wide, wide assortment of hot sauces. DON'T MISS THIS."}
{"text":"The burrito and quinoa  salad was excellent, but the place was noisy on a Saturday evening. Could not hear the people with me.  No table service, but delivery of food was very fast.  Would go again, but see it more as a place to get excellent fast food and not a quiet place to relax."}
{"text":"i LOVED this place,  i had an A+ burrito with some chips and guac and roasted corn. My friends had some great lookin tacos~  so spicy i was sweatin but it was worth it! Friendly staff made it even more A+~ cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"A few vegan options that are unique and tasty, it's hard to find a good Mexican place in downtown Toronto.  It's also a great stop if you want a snack in King West as you can order one taco at a time!

But the highlight of this place is the fresh salsa bar, which features a nice selection of mild, medium and hot salsas.  There is also a huge collection of hot sauces!"}
{"text":"Sauce Boss .
Salsa Bar .
Solid Baja Fish .
Korean Bolgogi too saucy, needed more balance .
Super chill spot . 
Damn good vibe ."}
{"text":"Un buen lugar para comer tacos mexicanos!
Pedimos nachos con guacamole para compartir, y un burrito, y entre dos fue suficiente. 16 CAD!!

Lo mejor es que el restaurant ofrece una gran variedad de salsas que puedes sacar cuantas veces quieras.

Recomendable!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience always! Nice outdoor seating, spacious indoors as well, complimentary sauce bar and great meal selections. Pro tip: if you're coming here for lunch, come a bit early to beat the crowds"}
{"text":"great service, great food and I love how they have a self serve salsa and hot sauce bar.
I would go everyday but its pretty far, but anyway, definitely coming back again.
My friend and I have the chips with fundido, mexican street corn, chicken tingy, mushroom taco and chicken fajita and it was alot food, but we were very happy. And you have to try the mexican street corn its the best thing ever!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. the food was very good. taco shells are very crispy. The sauce station is self serve, there is a very wide variety to choose from.  The chips that accompany the tacos are also warm and crispy.  My fav was the fish taco.  Decor is pleasant - feels like they are trying very hard to serve the hip crowd, so you will fit right in if you are hip."}
{"text":"Very nice casual burrito spot on King West. They have a great salsa bar with some really spicy options (I'm a huge fan of spice and still found some of them challenging). I had the S&T which was pretty good.  It's nice you can get a beer there too. Not a huge place so you may have to wait if you decide to sit."}
{"text":"You know salsa is like sex, if they are good they will make you sweat.


 Wilbur achieves this with its hot salsa bar, from pico de gallo to habanero, very nice

I am giving 4 stars for the nice decor, cleanliness and service and because the cashier is latina and has such beautiful eyes. 
Im sold mami, anything for you, anytime. I would marry you, a carne asada taco would seal our love on the first bite as you encounter a fair trade diamond ring.

Anyways the food....

Tacos are decent. They need more character a more pronounced flavour. They say less is more..



Free chips with tacos nice very nice

I would recommend to ask what kind of tortillas the customer wants. Being my first time I did not read the menu in detail so I thought corn was the default. 

Whatever, flour tortilla was nice.

Another thing, the air conditioning was quite cold, this gets the tacos cold in no time.

Looking forward live music on weekends, that would be nice."}
{"text":"Must Try: Shrimp & Shrooms Quesadilla & Carne Asada Tacos (and Guac, of course)

Rating: (9/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience: 

Great place amongst a sea of restaurants on King St. A \"walk-up'n'order\" style restaurant, there's a great causal vibe to it. There's a giant selection of pick your own salsa and spices, which a wide range of non-spicy to deathly spicy jalepenos. Pop is fountain pop, and it is all you can drink. There is also a modest selection of beer available. 

Tried a handful of tacos (Baja Fish, Pork, Bulgogi, Carne, and Chicken Tinga), with Carne being the standout best, and Baja Fish and Pork rounding out second and third place. I will say that the quesadilla was surprisingly original and delicious. Definitely need to try the burritos next time.

The service was great, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. 

Overall, great place that lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Gross heart burn food. Beware if you are a vegan. Gross fish taste. Clearly not vegan friendly. Avoid the chips which you have to pay for whether or not you eat them. They're fried in the same oil as the fish. Gross."}
{"text":"We went here awhile ago and the tacos were just okay. However, we went back tonight and the tacos were great! It seems like they changed the recipes a bit. I loved the chicken tinga and carne asada. The pork was good too. I'm a fan of their guacamole. The best part is the hot sauce/salsa bar. So much hot sauce. Great spot for beer and tacos."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good tacos in a stylish place in a convenient location.  I must admit I thought Wilbur Mexicana had more flash than substance, as there are plenty of dumpy taco places serving perfectly good tacos, and I thought Wilbur would take shortcuts. 

Fortunately that is not the case, and you get top quality ingredients at an affordable price.  You pick your tacos, then go to the hot sauce bar and select from a handful of sauces with differing spiciness.  

Then you walk over and pick up your toppings, with different salsas.  A personal favourite is the pineapple.

Mix and eat.  Life is good."}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican, a western knock-off. Tacos were not authentic at all, and flavours were very meh. Want real Mexican food? Eat at Tierra Azteka. 

1 star for the nice hot sauces, and 1 star for low prices = 2 stars.

I would eat here again if I'm reallllyyy hungry."}
{"text":"Everything my wife and I ordered was amazing :) highly recommend will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This place is a fun, casual and affordable option for tacos in downtown. The tacos are solid and they serve a side of chips with it. The best part is the salsa bar where there's a variety to choose from - spicy, pineapple, mango etc etc."}
{"text":"Like many fellow Torontonians, I have been spoiled by authentic, international cuisine often found in hole-in-the-wall joints, where more attention is paid to the food than the decor. I'm not saying that the tacos and the fresh salsas at Wilbur weren't tasty and I can def see why this place is popular. The food is uncomplicated, reasonably priced, nice location, etc. but it just didn't have the \"it\" factor for me.  It was enjoyable but not sure if I would go out of my way to get it, but it is a place I would recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Original had other dining plans, but those were prematurely ended. After walking by this place, my attention had been grabbed, but I am a sucker for Mexican food.  Place was pretty packed but luckily some seats opened up just as we arrived.  Ordered a Wlibur-rito with a Modelo. The burrito was a burrito worth having another in the future.  Their salsa bar was quite nice with a medley of sauces.  Those were good.  Definitely a good choice even with the communal seating they partially have going on."}
{"text":"What a great place!  The bulgogi tacos outstanding and my kids loved the chicken quesadilla.  The salsa bar makes it fun!"}
{"text":"So good!!!! Can't wait to go back. Ingredients used were very fresh. Such a delicious salsa selection"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourites! This place is fantastic in atmosphere and food. I love their menu, my faves include the mushroom and shrimp quesadilla, hardshell shrimp tacos and of course you must try their margarita (it's on tap FYI) oh how could I forget the insane hot sauce and salsa bar, definitely worth the visit"}
{"text":"Once you go Wilbur, you don't go back to Chipotle.

I didn't think the bulgogi taco would work, but it's great."}
{"text":"Hands down best burrito in the city. I go here at least once a week. Always grab an extra bag of chips on the side to go with their amazing salsa selection."}
{"text":"We went to Wilbur on Friday night dinner with my wife. Food is fresh but small portions. Staff very cheerful. Amazing salsa bar"}
{"text":"Really cool space, and I appreciate the hot sauce and salsa options, but the burritos themselves are a bit like glorified Chipotle. They do grill the burritos, but not enough, and the tortillas are weirdly chewy and thick. Fillings are fine. Maybe the tacos are better? Still, maybe worth going once or twice for the design, and if you are a Chipotle fan (I know I'm in the minority here) you'll probably love it."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to checked in after visiting Centre Island for some late lunch. What an amazing place! The workers are so lovely and the relaxed vibe of the restaurant is very welcoming. 

Best of all, the food is affordable and delicious - we finished everything! Ordered roasted corn, taquitos, tacos x2, quesadillas, and a lime Jarritos drink for ~$30. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of cali, great atmosphere, amazing food and good selection of sauces and salsa"}
{"text":"This was a great new find last weekend as a group of us was trying to find something new for \"date night\". I called ahead and got a voicemail informing me that they are a fast casual restaurant which meant at present they do not accept resos - first come first serve.

Being on King W, I anticipated that anything new would be crazy packed with line-ups out the door, but we soon discovered that despite this place being new and bustling that the uber fast service helps to keep the crowds moving, people fed and happy, even at pique hours.

I don't need to wax on about the decor, the salsa bar and the endless selection of hot sauces - its been said already, but rest assured, it's there and it's pretty awesome. I didn't get to check out the fountain pop machine because I was having beer, but they'll be getting their draught beer in soon and I think a return visit is in order.

For dinner 4 of us shared in two appetizers, the chips and quac with queso fundido AND the beef taquitos. The quac was awesome, the queso... meh. The taquitos were ok too but not my fave. I think they need a little work on their appetizers still as well as their tostito chips - I found some to be crunch while others were chewy... personal preference not my taste.

The best things there were the tacos, each of us had between 3-4 tacos each and we were stuffed. I went with 2 carne asada, 1 Korean bulgogi and 1 chicken tinga. These were served up faster than we could hang our coats up under the table (like crazy fast) and they were slammed packed with fillings and meat (mostly meat). Each was juicy and delicious. 

Most impressive of all was the final bill, under $50 taxes in / couple, where else can you go out for dinner for two on a Friday for under $50 and leave feeling like you could have spent $200 - I'll definitely be back here for eats again soon!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Dope quick dine in place.
Their two veggie taco options are unreal, and you're crazy to miss the corn or guacamole.
Salsa bar? Hellloooo.
Love popping in for 3 cheap tacos and a cheap dos equis. Quick delish meal and back out to being hip."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of tacos! The self serve hot sauce bar has an unbelievably wide selection so there's something for everybody. Self-serve style drinks station. Serves beer as well.
Great style, food and vibes inside. Would definitely head back for late night eats."}
{"text":"Great eatery with fusion tacos and a spice/salsa bar. My favorite are the street corn and the bulgogi taco. We come here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

I can't count how many times I have gone here for lunch, I love that it is so close to work!

Everything I have tried is amazing, their burritos, mexican street corn, chips and guac, quesadilla, it's all great!

I love that they don't give you a puny amount of guacamole and it isn't \"extra\" either! I love that they have a free salsa bar as well!

Service is great and fast, food is always good, nothing bad to say here!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Greeted us at the door and asked us if it was our first time.  Explained the process to us and told us to order now and grab a seat.  Go crazy at the Salsa bar before your food arrives. 

Got the corn and 4 tacos - baja fish, Pork, Chicken tinga and bulgogi taco.  I put their tacos below the ones from Grand electric and Seven lives.  But the Atmosphere makes up for it.  A lot relaxing and easier to find spots.  Not crazy loud music."}
{"text":"Came to Wilbur on a Thursday night with a girlfriend to fuel up for a night of fierce singalongs and dancing at Queen Bey's Formation World Tour.

Wilbur is a fun and casual environment. You can order food and alcohol and sit at either the circular doubles table or high rectangular communal tables. 

We ordered the following to sample each of the different tortilla styles: 

Tacos:
- Chicken Tinga - Shredded chicken tucked into a classic nacho chip style corn tortilla 
- Baja Fish - Beer battered deep fried mahi-mahi wrapped in a soft corn tortilla
- Mushroom - Grilled mushroom wrapped in a soft flour tortilla 

Cocktail: 
- Bridgeport Stormy Cocktail - Essentially a Moscow Mule, made with a vodka buck, spicy ginger beer, lime juice and garnished with a slice or wedge of lime - served in a copper mug! Fantastic but could use less ice.

Our tacos were put into a rectangular serving box with a generous handful of nacho chips. 

Brace yourself for the best part..... the sauce and salsa station. Your brain will go into buffet mode and want to try everything from mild to firebomb spicy. Sampling every salsa is encouraged with mini saucer cups, so go for it! 

Wilbur is a great taco contender. The line ups generally go out the door and food is made fresh, so if you can hold on to your taco shells I'd def recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Popped in randomly with my friend and was slightly confused about the way the operation worked. On a busy night you order first and then get a seat but soon realized it was like a canteen and you sit with whomever at a shared table. I really liked that small aspect. The array of hot sauces and salsa is a nice touch and I didn't mind having to get up for it. Food overall is alright, nothing amazing- the atmosphere makes up for it. Dishes are shareable (I got the quinoa bowl), and chips/guac. Prob won't return but for a one time drop in I didn't mind!"}
{"text":"Best mexican fast food place! It's a great place and has great options."}
{"text":"So you're downtown, you're craving tacos... And no surprise, the line-up at La Carnita is dishearteningly long. If you're not down for the wait, head on over to Wilbur for an equally satisfying Mexican fix. (Sorry La Carnita, I still love you.)

As soon as you walk in, take a second to soak in the high ceilings and modern decor... Then immediately send a friend to save some seats for your hungry party because this place can get busy fast.

Alright, let's get to the good stuff.

CHIPS, GUACAMOLE, AND QUESO FUNDIDO - Chips and guac are a no-brainer, but when you throw in this bowl of spicy, melted cheese dip? Next. Level.

CHICKEN TINGA TACO - This is a must-get. Juicy chicken with a nice kick from the chipotle-chile sauce. Whether you're a lover of hard taco shells or soft taco shells, you'll make peace with this taco because the shell is a crispy corn tortilla - essentially a love-child of the two.

CARNE ASADA (skirt steak), BULGOGI (grilled marinated beef) and BAJA FISH also get honourable mentions because they all pack a punch in flavour. All taco orders also come with a side of nacho chips.

But wait! You're not done yet. Head on over to the shrine of hot sauces and toppings bar after you've picked up your food to customize your tacos. The combinations are endless, but I highly recommend the pineapple salsa.

To sum it up, you can depend on this place to dish out some of the best Mexican flavours at a very reasonable price, and that's something to taco 'bout. ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious.  So fresh.  Quac is amazing.  Place is super clean and there's lots of space between the tables which i appreciate."}
{"text":"We had fish and pork tacos, an order of guacamole, and margarita on tap and it was delicious! A very unique environment and they have an awesome hot sauce collection. Definitely worth checking out this spot!"}
{"text":"The last time I came to Wilbur I was super torn on how to give a review because I loved the location and ambience, but not the service and food so much. I decided to give this place another try today, and I'm so glad I did. Like mentioned in my previous review, I'm a California native so really make it a mission to find the best Mexican food everywhere I go. 

It was a busy Friday evening when I came in to dine today with a friend, but was surprised at how fast the line moved and how friendly all the servers were! Instead of ordering a burrito this time, I went with a burrito bowl. Hallelujah! Now I know why Wilbur has such great reviews. The burrito was just way too dry and unflavorful for me. The bowl on the other hand was a ton of food and easy to customize flavor based on the expansive offerings of unlimited salsa. I added tomatillo, pico de gallo, and Asada salsa to my bowl which easy increases the volume of food and makes it so much more flavorful! I honestly had to pack half of it to bring home as takeout. I also loved the quinoa and sweet potato fries in my veggie burrito bowl. I didn't get the guac and chips this time because guac was too salty here last time. 

I still wish they offered regular fries instead of sweet potato fries like a real Cali burrito!! Please Wilbur 

Though I didn't receive great service last time I came here, this time the service was impeccable! At one point, their debit and credit machine broke and the servers handled it very well - informing every customer in line for over 45 minutes about the \"cash only\" situation. I ended up being $1.50 short due to this and the server covered me through her tips, which was incredibly kind and rare to find at a King St. restaurant! 

Overall, I love the vibe of this place - casual and chill, but still a great place to talk for hours with friends or colleagues. The salsa bar makes me keep coming back, as munching on chips and salsa over great conversation is one of my favorite things in life!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place and boy I was not disappointed! When we arrived there was a huge lineup. We went around 7pm and it was busy but the line went by pretty fast. I ordered the chicken Tinga, carne asada and bulgogi. I've never tried a bulgogi taco but it was surprisingly tasty! My favourite was the chicken tinga. What I liked is that the hot sauces and toppings (pico de gallo, limes) are all in a separate section in which you can put extra toppings onto your tacos and they have tiny sauce take out containers as well. They also give us a side of nacho chips. We  ordered the Jamaica Agua Fresca and the watermelon lime agua fresca. Both were very refreshing! One thing they should change is the pricing on the \"explore the menu\" option on the Yelp website. It said the tacos were 3.75 but at the restaurant they are 4.25. Not that much of a difference but they should still update that. The washrooms were kept clean and the cashier was really welcoming. Overall I had a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Dynamite burritos with a side of nachos. An assortment of salsas. Best burrito in the 6ix. Q."}
{"text":"You can't keep me out of this place! Everything I've tried (and that's almost the entire menu), has been fresh, simple and delicious. No, it's not authentic Mexican food, they make no promises in that way. If you're looking for salt rim margaritas, try again. I come here after work all the time for some quick fresh tacos that hit the spot every time. The best part? You prepay so no awkward looking around for your server to get your check."}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about Wilbur prior to going. The cafeteria way of ordering and taking a number was a little off putting to me- but don't let this or the busiest of the lunch crowd stop you from coming here.! 

After surveying the menu I settled on chips, guacamole and queso fundido and Mexican street corn to start. For a main, I went with the Baja Fish Taco and the Mushroom Taco. All good meals need a beverage to accompany them so I went for a Michaela. 

As we waited for our food to be delivered to our table we scanned the condiment bar. It was filled with fresh salsas and a variety of hot sauces clearly labeled with the amount of spiciness. They had a perfect mix of mild, extreme heat and smoky options. The salsa bar alone made me love my experience even more, because condiments right? 

The chips were still hot coming from the fryer and the guacamole was fresh and had the perfect chunkiness and the queso had the perfect amount of heat and thickness to it. I was so happy to see that my tacos came with extra chips so I could enjoy the rest of the guac and queso but also take more advantage of the salsa bar.

THE MEXICAN CORN THOUGH! You'll be so focused on the flavor that you wont care or notice about having all the kernels wedged in your teeth, I would come back for the corn alone. Drool 

The mushroom taco was a bit soggy but still delicious because of the pairing with the cotija cheese. The fish was crispy and definitely a must order here. I was however disappointed with the Michaela although I have extremely high expectations they were not met- there was just something off about the base of the drink. 

Over all this is an excellent place to grab a bite in a brightly lit laid-back atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Wilbur Mexicana and had to come back for their baja fish tacos and their corn! Came around the evening on a weekend and this place was very busy, but it's not hard to find a seat since people always come and go! The prices are also very reasonable and the tacos are filled with a lot of toppings, that it can easily fall out trying to eat the taco (and can get pretty messy!) It comes with a side of chips which is a plus so you don't have to order chips separately if you just want a small amount. Their corn is also really good and flavourful, the seasoning is the right amount of spice and isn't overwhelming. If I'm in the area and craving tacos, will definitely come by to try more options on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place again and I discovered the fajitas.  A sliced steak cooked perfectly at medium rare.  It was served on top of a mixture of onions, peppers, and cheese.  It wasn't high on presentation, I have to admit.  However, once I created my own little fajita and topped it off with some hot sauce...  Damn, it was good! You get 4 small tortillas, shredded iceberg lettuce, and small containers of guacamole and sour cream.  

The burrito was alright.  It needed more spice or something to liven it up.  I guess that's what the hot sauces are for?  Maybe I should've chosen more of the toppings to ensure better flavour.  

I love their chips.  So addictive.  Still love the hot sauces and salsa bar!  Pineapple... Mmmm..."}
{"text":"I've been for lunch 4 times now and am always super happy with this place.  Only complaint would be a bit too busy for lunch and hard to get in. (I've probably tried 10 times in total.)

Servers are super friendly, helpful and on point.  First time I went my friend ordered me the wrong thing and the server overheard, he asked what I wanted instead, and said, no problem immediately got the order changed.  Most places would whine if I asked to change.

The other female servers are always super nice and when they notice you don't have a drink as if they can get you an ice water.  Again, most places make you feel cheap when you ask for water and they offer it.

Food is super tasty.  Love the tacos and the burritos.

Will continue to frequent this place...when I can get it."}
{"text":"It's alright, but a tad gimmicky and just too King St. for me. The huge array of hot sauces is cool, but I preferred the ones made in house.

The Guacamole and Queso Fundito starter was awesome and great value. Although I did not realize that the tacos all come with a helping of tortilla chips and you can grab salsa at the bar. 

I had a Bulgogi Taco, Chicken Tinga and Baja Fish. None of them blew me away. I mean, when I had the short rib tacos at Playa Cabana I was almost crying when they were gone. When Wilbur's tacos were done I was like \"yeah, those were... okay\" and \"okay\" is a fairly boring descriptive term to use. 

I'll confess that I was looking for more of a sit down place for dinner. I'm not a fan of paying for food and not being served. I like to be served. I mean I really NEED to be served because I'm a server myself and it builds a great deal of resentment and rage up in a server to not dine on the other side of the table from time to time. Some people may like this style of restaurant (I'd call it more of an eatery), It's ok for what it is, but definitely not my thing.

Once again, kudos for the King West Restaurants having two gluten free salads with choices of protein. I say \"kudos\" with tongue in cheek as I think it's a cop out way for the restaurant to cater to King St. Douche-baggery. I guess knowing the customer is important :P

It wasn't cheap. The guacamole/queso starter, 5 tacos and 2 margaritas was just over $52. Sure, you don't need to leave a big tip, but I don't mind tipping.  

Frozen Margaritas were fit for children. I don't think there was any tequila in them. 

I will say the simultaneous eye watering from the ghost pepper sauce and the brain freeze from the margarita was a whole lotta fun!

Would I come back? Probably not. Is it bad? No. But it is King St. Enough said."}
{"text":"Overrated. The only thing I enjoyed here was the guacamole. The tacos were mediocre even for the cost. The tortilla chips were way too salty and the queso had a strange aftertaste. I get that the price point is low but doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the taste. Okay, it's exciting that there's so many salsas, but not so exciting that they all taste bland. 

Maybe I'm being harsh but I feel that with dozens of taco restaurants all over the city you need to up your game a little. I'm happy to spend a few extra bucks for quality, originality and taste. 

I thought the service here was fine. Except it's hard to tell who works there especially when it's busy. The servers just blend into the crowd - is that the purpose?

The place was packed though so maybe I'm wrong. Either way won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place to eat they need to hire a professional cashier.. food is excellent."}
{"text":"Popped in here looking for a quick meal and hearing good things.  I guess I came in during the dinner rush hour - about 6pm on a Thursday - but managed to find two seats.  Wilbur is a seat-yourself format.

Tacos were average, a bit on a bland side.  Street corn was tasty!  Guacamole is a steal at $4.50 and comes with plenty of chips.  Beware, ALL of the tacos also come with chips so I ended up having a chip mountain.  Good thing they have a serve yourself salsa/hot sauce bar.  The pineapple salsa was my fav.

Service was blistering fast.  I swear the guac and chips were at my table before I even sat down.  In and out in 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. The selection of pepper sauces is incredible. I've had almost every taco on the menu and they're all solid."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Mexican food. Love every single item on their menu! literally every single item they have, we tried. love the location, the atmosphere, the price and obviously their food. super nice staff. definitely recommending this place."}
{"text":"FINALLY got into Wilbur (-1 for crowded space). Tried a few items - quest dip, guacamole, fish burrito. They were all good, but I'm surprised at the hype about this place. It's fine, but no big deal..."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place.

I came here on a Friday night for dinner.  Every time I looked, there was always a line up but it moved rather quickly.  I ordered a Baja Fish and Chicken Tinga taco.  It was nice that the tacos came with a side of tortilla chips.  This place has a salsa bar and multiple rows of hot sauce.  I also ordered a serving of Mexican Street Corn.  The loved the interior decor and the vibe this restaurant gave.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Had the steak tacos and the bulgogi tacos. They were delicious.... full of flavor with a little kick. This spot seems pretty popular, the line gets long at times but moves very fast. They have menus at the door so that you're prepared to order when you make it to the counter. Definitely a must visit!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dining here! My friend and I shared the guac, which was a good size for 2 people. They also have a complementary salsa bar and the biggest variety of bottled sauces I've ever seen.  Water is also complementary and self-serve.  I ordered 3 tacos, which were delicious, quite large, and filled me up.  The menu is vegetarian friendly, but I would double check with the cashier which items have meat as I accidentally ordered a meaty taco.  

I really liked that you order and pay at the counter and find a free seat (ie no tips; good for students like me!). There was a good amount of seating inside and on the patio, the restaurant was modern, and had a good ambiance. 

Overall, would be back!"}
{"text":"I consider Wilbur a very good Mexican fast food even though is a bit pricey. But you have guaranteed all the freshness that you can expect from a handmade on a spot sandwich with ingredients that are not frozen. 

Had a carne asada on a flour tortilla and a pork tacos still on a flour tortilla all to go. 
Everything was served along corn chips. 

Then you have a wide variety of choices of spicy sauces you can add for free to your items. 
Surely a large number of sauces you don't even know where to start because you want to try them all. 

Great location, warmth environment with welcoming staff. Too bad I had to go for a take away because this is one of those restaurant you would love to dine in. 

:) well done Wilbur. Keep up with the great job."}
{"text":"Love the pineapple salsa! Lots of included salsa and hot sauces to try. Seats are communal. We randomly walked by this hipster canteen-esque restaurant and was pulled in by curiosity as the dining style seemed different from the other 'regular' restaurants with formal seating on this King St strip. 

The brisket taquitos are so tender with a heap of tasty guacamole on top. If you love avocado, you will love this place and this dish! Get the guacamole with chips too while you're at it! The original Wilbur-rito is a very hefty dish - we had the chicken and it was incredibly yummy. We're definitely eager to try this place again!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night around 9:30 pm, it was super busy, long line up but worth it. 

Bulgogi taco was delicious! My cousin ordered the Burrito and it was HUGE, probably the biggest I've ever seen. He loved it. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"GrEATings

Was working near by and saw this pre lunch and could not wait for lunch time.

The decor is great. Trendy yet edgy with a long hall type feel that leads you from ordering to grabbing sauces and salsas for your order.

I go three tacos to try out a few of their offerings.  I would say the baja fish and bulgogi are not to be missed.  I will return to try more.

Service - 10 
Decor - 9
Food - 9

Come hungry!

If you want to eat quickly and have a severe allergy to lineups..... Get here early."}
{"text":"Went in at 12:30 on a Saturday and it wasn't overwhelmingly busy - which was pleasant. The serving staff was very friendly and asked if we were enjoying our food 3 times.

Delicious quinoa salad. Could of used a bit of a lighter dressing. The chips and guac was so flavourful, a bit heavy on the garlic. The fish was a good add on to the salad, was a bit pricy as an add on though. 

The wide range of salsas and hot sauces that you get to browse and select on your own was a cool touch. The salsa dishes are a bit hard to dip your chips in. 

Loved the old-school Hiphop soundtrack."}
{"text":"Great casual spot for good meal. My husband and I visited today in the rain and found good food accompanied by good service. Nice and clean, quick service too."}
{"text":"Used to be amazing but with the line out the door the kitchen seems rushed and the food is suffering. Last time the cheese in my burrito was still cold and the tacos just seemed thrown together."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago with a friend around lunch time (12-12:30pm) wait time for a table was fairly reasonable (8-10 min). There are hard copy menus at the front of the restaurant where you'll be able to browse as you wait, you pay/order your food first and then you'll be seated at the next opening.

I ordered the \"Cali Burrito\" in a bowl ($9.75). This was carne asada (beef), rice, sweet potato fries, jack and oaxaca cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa suave. Loved how filling and flavourful this was. 

When we received our food, realized this restaurant was more self serve and we had to grab our utensils, napkins, cups of water and choice of toppings (salsa, pico de gallo, pineapple, etc.) at their salsa and sauces bar.

Overall great experience at Wilbur, reasonably priced menu, quick service, lovely vibrant interior and natural window lighting, would defenitely come again for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place with aesthetic filled walls. The food is prepared very quickly and down on the spot! I ordered bulgolgi taco, baja fish taco, avacado taco. Which were all so amazing and flavourful! I definetly advise you all to go and try their assortments of tacos because it not very big so it's more like finger food."}
{"text":"I could eat here every week, or multiple times a week, given how many times I crave tacos. I love this place because it's quick, easy and cheap! It is almost a food court style type of ordering system, where you line up, order, take a number to where you want to sit and the food will be brought there. Another amazing thing about this place is their salsa bar and hot sauce bar. The salsa bar has many different types ranging from mild to hot. The hot sauce has at least 30 bottles of different types of hot sauce - so you gotta try them all! or try to.... 

It is my go to place for tacos in the entertainment district that's for sure. The food is so reasonably priced, it'll fit every person's budget!"}
{"text":"Are these the best tacos I've ever had? No. But did they satisfy all my taco cravings? Oh yeah.

The concept here is pretty cool with the salsa bar and extensive hot sauce selections (too bad I don't eat spicy!) and the prices are fair. Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered chips and guac, 3 tacos, and chicken fajitas. 

One thing that you should know about me is that I LOVE guac so I spooned that into my mouth like no tomorrow but my boyfriend commented that it, along with the chips, were rather salty. Y'know, he's probably right but I just overlooked it because guac is my one true love and my loyalty blind-sights me. 

For the tacos, the chicken tinga was probably my favourite, which is uncharacteristic of me because I like soft shells more than hard shells. The reason being is that 1) it had guac 2) there were large chunks of nicely marinated chicken 3) the crunchy shell worked really to balance out the softer and mushier textures of the filling. The carne asada was alright - I found the pork to be a bit too tough, and the baja fish was also just standard. 

The chicken fajitas was pretty good. I like hot foods, which none of the above were so it was nice to get something on a sizzling hot plate. Plenty of peppers and chicken and there was melted cheese, mmmm! I would just suggest that you better eat this dish quickly before the corn tortillas (especially the ones at the bottom) get cold and dry out."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican Food!!! Best burrito bowls in town. Their homemade nachos chips are the bomb; as well their sauces are to die for!! If you love spicy as much as I do, then you'll be in heaven.  One disappointment was the one time they overcooked the taquitos. However overall great place for a Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Tried a bunch of their tacos and a customized burrito and it all tasted amazing. My favourite place for a burrito now, better than burrito boys or chipotle. Alot of variety for their salsas and hot sauces."}
{"text":"For the past two years, I've always walked by this place and said \"I need to try this next time\". I finally got to dine here and definitely have major regrets.....on not stopping and trying this place sooner. Any day you come by this place, dinner time till close will always be busy so prepare yourself to wait in a line (the line goes by fast). The food offering is great, ranging from tacos to fajitas. If you are feeling like you need a nice refreshing alcoholic beverage, no worries, Wilbur offers beer, wine and mixed cocktails on tap. Once you order and get your food, you can head over to the salsa bar, which is such an amazing add-on that truly elevates this joint. The food tastes fresh and flavourful but definitely not true Mexican food. Come try Wilbur to taste a street spin on Mexican food and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Just ok Mexican.

When it comes to Mexican food I've come to expect food bursting with flavor and Wilbur food is not all that tasty, but it's convenient and pretty fast, with great atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Wilbur.  I didn't like Mexican food that much before coming here and now I love it.  The price is incredible when you think of the quality of food you're getting. The service is friendly and super fast.  Get the chips with two dips to start and try two or three different tacos.  I recommend the baja fish and the carne asada."}
{"text":"Everything is great here but the bulgogi taco is our favourite off the menu. I love how our orders come with a side of nachos because the salsa bar is amazing! You can help yourself to as much salsa and pick from a large display of different hot sauces as you want. 

The atmosphere is very chill but upbeat at the same time, fast and friendly service. The lunch rushes will  see lines up to the door but it's worth it."}
{"text":"So sad they took the chicken tinga off the menu and replaced it with a standard chicken taco. The pork taco has also been replaced which makes me even sadder."}
{"text":"It's good, but there are better Mexican spots in this city.

The chips and dips were actually quite good. The chicken taco was fantastic. The baja fish and avocado tacos left a lot to be desired. They tasted pretty bland...

Otherwise, great ambiance and decor. Staff are great. It was pretty busy on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Last time I came here was over a year ago. This time around, I was not so impressed with the food. I got the baja fish taco, avocado slice taco, and bulgogi taco. None of them were satisfying. I probably enjoyed the fish taco most though, and then the avocado taco and then the bulgogi taco. The flavour combinations just weren't there.

My friend got the burrito and it was pretty good, but the steak all at the top, then the beans, and then the rice. It wasn't spread out evenly in the burrito. 

Service was great on our most recent visit."}
{"text":"It's like a fancier and pricier version of Chipotle, but also better! I had their rice bowl with steak, which came with guacamole. Plus all the salsa I can try from their Salsa Bar? YES PLEASE. My favourite was the one with corn. Yum. 

My friend had some tacos, and she said that the cod one is excellent. Although, I think their tacos are pretty pricey. Not sure how worth it it was.

But dayum, look at the size of their burritos! I will have to come back for dem bad boyz."}
{"text":"Expensive compared to other Mexican places nearby but it is worth every penny. Very laid back vibe which is true to the Mexican street food style that they are going for. There self serve hot sauce and fresh salsa bar are very nice to explore. When ordering tacos st he portion size looks a bit small but is somehow very filling. Expect a rush at lunch time on weekdays. Overall highly recommend if you are near king street area"}
{"text":"Cool place. Nice selection of burritos, tacos,nachos and quesadilla. Lots of vegetarian options, mexican beer options. The tacos come with small portion of nachos. They have stattions to take as much as you want the salsa, tomatilla, etc plus a large selection of hot pepper suaces. The design is cool, staff are friendly and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bulgogi taco and the corn on the cob was my fav. Friend ordered the cali burrito bowl and enjoyed it very much as well-couldn't finish it though (generous portion size). 

Was in the area for a four day class. Ended up coming here two days in a row for lunch. Would recommend you to get here before 11:30, as the area can get very busy on weekdays during lunch hours. If you are staying in during their lunch hours, then make sure to have a friend order and grab the sauces while the other grabs a table. 

If you do take out, dont forget to grab yourself a fork/ spoon."}
{"text":"The Bulgogi Taco was better received for me on a flour tortilla -- it just tasted more firm and moist.  The bulgogi beef were sweetened and the cabbage and pear made it taste very refreshing at the same time.  It was a very good combination of tastes in a taco and was definitely a more memorable and good-tasting taco that I've had."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick lunch on a weekday! The salsa bar is to die for & everything on the menu is delicious. Service is super fast! Love this place! Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"great spot for a quick bite... but tasty too! Had the fish and pork tacos and a beer. $14 can't beat that! great salsa bar to go with the homemade chips that come with your meal.  clean, casual and affordable!"}
{"text":"Always a winner! 

Enough options for a vegetarian. The corn and queso are my favorite. I prefer the avacado taco....mushroom options for vegetarians are too typical. The only suggestion would to switch up the mushroom taco for something more creative. 

Fresh Margaritas would be a winner....if they served them. 

Definitely going back....soon...and frequently."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! There are good vibes everywhere when you're at Wilbur.  

My boss had wanted to take the company to Wilbur for quite some time now, but the long lineups just didn't gel with our schedules at the time. Wilbur, with its high capacity seating,  is always buzzing with diners. Always, especially during prime lunch time, when you'll be lucky to get seating and when the line goes out the door and around the corner (the workers are quick, mind you).  I advise going before 11:30 am and after 1:30 pm when the restaurant is about half full with enough empty seats to save you from scrambling for a spot. 

We ordered three types of tacos: Carne Asada,  pork, and fish.  All were a gastric journey of their own.  There is a plethora of salsas and sauces to further garnish your food, but the tacos were delightful to the palette even without them.  Texture-wise, they hit the spot and they weren't too runny from the  meat juices and sauces that already constituted them.  Having juices run down my hands while I eat tacos is not the best feeling in the world, so Wilbur has mastered serving tacos full of flavour without the mess!  For the flavour, reasonable price, and low need to hoard napkins, Wilburs' tacos have earned a spot among my top two within the GTA. 

Furthermore, if you're a regular, which you should be, don't skimp out on the wide array of salsas and sauces available.  There will be a condiment for every mood, including a refreshing pineapple salsa!  Major props to them for the myriad of additional flavours you can spin into your bowl, fajita, taco, or quesadilla for an extra personal touch!

Now, decor-wise, there is a hip functionality to the interior. It honestly looks like a fast food restaurant with a modern, new generational twist.  For such a highly frequented spot, the workers keep it well polished; you won't find yourself reeling from uncleared tables and dirty chairs. Also, the music they play in the background isn't overpowering and adds a nice vibe.  You may even catch some live music from time to time.  To be frank, yes, I give it two thumbs up for any causal lunch/dinner date! 

My final word: Go to Wilbur and enjoy those happy vibes!"}
{"text":"On a street filled with pretentiousness and over-priced establishments, Wilbur is a breath of fresh air. Genuinely friendly service, delicious fresh food at reasonable prices, an extensive hot sauce and salsa bar, and an upbeat ambience. Highly recommend the bulgogi and fish tacos. Oh and did I mention they serve the best salad in the city? Must try their quinoa chickpea salad!"}
{"text":"I'd eat here every week if I could! The menu is diverse without being overwhelming, they have plenty of options on flour tortillas (great for someone like me who avoids corn), and the prices are reasonable.

My fiance described the atmosphere best: \"It's like a food truck and a hip restaurant had a baby.\" You order your food, get a numbered place holder, and sit wherever you can find space. (The place fills up quickly!) Your food is brought out to you in about 10 minutes, and you can browse the range of salsas and hot sauces available off to the side while you wait.

I had two tacos: the bulgogi ($4.25) and the mushroom ($3.75) with a side of sour cream ($1) and a fountain drink ($2). That was a perfect sized meal for me, but the tacos are on the smaller side, so big eaters may want to add a third taco. The mushroom was fine, which a bit of char grilled flavor and lots of texture, but I felt like the onions overpowered it a bit. The bulgogi taco was the star, though. Oh, man, I'll gladly order three of those things next time! The meat was tender, the sauce was spicy and sweet, and the cabbage added the right amount of crunch. My fiance's chicken quesadilla ($10) was also cooked to perfection, with melty cheese and tender chicken. Both came with a side of corn ships and guac; we didn't eat a ton of them because, again, we don't eat a lot of corn, but they were excellent. Everything tasted like it was made fresh and seasoned carefully.

Just be aware that if you come here at any time, it's going to be hopping. You'll probably end up sharing a table with strangers. That didn't bother us, but some people were clearly uncomfortable with the set up and stood around waiting for an area to clear. They offer takeout, too, so if you want the flavor without the atmosphere, get your delicious tacos to go."}
{"text":"After such a long time, I finally made it into Wilbur. It's been one of those things, on my ever growing list of places to eat at or try out, and it's taken forever to cross off.
Unfortunately, I found Wilbur to be underwhelming.

First guac is $5, and only 1 medium sized avocado amount of guac. It comes with a tray of chips that is impossible to finish with the amount of guac you get. If you get extra, to attempt to finish said chips, $1 gets you guac that's stuffed into a tiny tartar sauce style container. Definitely not worth the price, and rather ridiculous.

Next, whole attempt to be cool and hip because it's located in King W -- it just doesn't work for me. While the decor is cool, I just felt that overall it was a poor trade off. The attempt to be a takeout taco joint with a serve yourself salsa bar did nothing for me. The food is boring. When the star of the show, or rather supposed star, is lacking, the rest is meaningless.

Basically come here when you want a quick snack while drunk so you can be spotted by the after work/club crews. Then you won't be able to tell how basic the food is. If you're looking for good Mexican, there's plenty of other fish, even along King W, for you to hit up."}
{"text":"This place has the best burrito bowls ever!!! Extremely filling for 9.75. Comes with guacomole unlike Chipotle. It all tastes fresh and made with love. The staff there are very friendly, and clear dishes quite quickly. You order at the front counter like a fast food place, they give you a numbered sign, and then sit at a table. The staff bring their order to you. I find this is a unique blend of restaurant and fast food joint, sans the tips. Eat here if youre in the area, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Wilbur is a great spot for lunch or an after-work bite. Be careful though, it's super busy. Luckily - the service is really quick and the food is definitely worth it. Love this place. Highly recommend splitting the Fajitas with a friend.

Huge plus for anyone who loves a good variety of spice - there's a ton of different hot sauces for you to choose from!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place whenever I have a taco craving! Their food is consistent and service is quick. This place is always packed - especially around lunch and dinner hours. 

I always have to order the Bulgogi and Carne Asada tacos when I come here. These are a MUST TRY! They also have a complementary salsa and hot sauce bar. You have to try the pineapple salsa - soooo good! I swear I come here sometimes because I just want some pineapple salsa haha."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 7 last Friday, there was a line, however it moved very quickly. We order guacamole to share with chips. I got the Baja fish taco & the grilled avocado taco. My partner order the Baja fish taco & the chicken taco. We both loved the fish taco. I personally wasn't a big fan of the grilled avocado taco, the avocado itself was amazing, perfectly ripe, however the pineapple salsa on top ruined it; the Taco fell apart immediately. My partner love the fish taco, the chicken taco was decent. 
We both loved the guacamole and the chips, and the salsa & hit sauce bar is so exciting! 
I will definitely be back to try to the mushroom tack & to eat the fish taco again!"}
{"text":"Six of us went here tonight.  Four of us from out of town?  First time to the place.  You order your food and look for somewhere to sit.  The place was packed and we waited for about 10 minutes to get a table....talk about luck.  Anyways, when the food came it was excellent.  Starting with nachos, Mexican street corn, fish burritos, and steak fajitas.  Defiantly a great place to go.  The service was great and pleasant."}
{"text":"This is a semi fast food restaurant. Where you order, they give you a number and place it at your table to deliver your food. I've ordered the Baja fish (corn tortilla) beer battered mahi-mahi, cabbage, pico de gallo, chipotle crema. ($4.75)The fish was nicely done, not too oily.

The grilled avocado - Pineapple salsa, chipotle crema, cotija $3.75. I find the avocado a bit hard. I wouldn't order it next time.

What really caught my attention is the huge stand full of different sauces. All of them are tasty. I like the one with pineapple. I am lining up for the bulgogi taco and chips and guacamole as I type this. The guacamole was soooo fresh. I loved it! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Wilbur instantly became my favourite restaurant. The entire experience is super fun and exciting. On top of that, the food is delicious, generously portioned and reasonably priced. I got the Chicken Tinga ($4.25), Pork ($4.25), and Bulgogi ($4.25) tacos which came with chips on the side. They were all amazing but the Chicken Tinga was my personal favourite! It's the only hard taco on the menu and a definite must try. The ingredients went so well together and it was topped with more guacamole than I expected. I was able to use some as dip for my chips and still have a good amount for my taco. I also tried the Mexican Street Corn ($4.50) which was perfectly seasoned. 

The self-serve hot sauce and salsa bar are uniquely set up. You don't have to be shy because everyone goes back for seconds and thirds (..or in my case fourths and fifths). The pineapple salsa was so tasty with unexpected big chucks of pineapple. 

I could rave about this place for a few more paragraphs but the bottom line is that this place has amazing food and vibes. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!

OK how's this - 

Their tacos are delicious and the major differentiator is their INSANE SELECTION OF SPICY SALSAS and HOT SAUCES!

We love their Carne Asada & chicken tinga tacos along with their steak fajitas!

Slap some spicy salsa on any of that and it's awesome

Service? TOP NOTCH

Vibe? Excellent"}
{"text":"got the mexican street corn and mushroom taco
came w free nachos
cool atmosphere but i wouldnt go to this place regularly, kinda $$ for me"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for a delicious burrito bowl.  Their burritos are awesome too, but the bowl is my preferred food of choice at Wilbur. 

The custom salsa bar also comes in clutch allowing you to mix your own flavours and levels of heat. 

Sometimes the line to order gets pretty long, but once you've placed your order, your food comes pretty quickly, under 5 minutes. 

Did I mention no extra charge for guac?"}
{"text":"The line can be a little too long sometimes and that means you'll have to stand outside for a bit. They don't have a lot to choose from the menu but their selection of sauces will leave you stuttering for a few minutes. It's a really nice and open space that's very accessible via the public transit."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious and cost is decent. Highly recommend of you can find a table. Oh, and I love the hot sauce and salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Who says Tdot doesn't have good Mexican? 

We walked around town all day, made it past the Jays game emptying out, were getting hangry, and stumbled upon Wilbur.

This is my favorite type of Mexican place. It's got an EXTENSIVE salsa bar. Effffff yessssss. That's what makes this place better than most. 

But the baja fish. The batter was light, crispy, and airy that didn't steal any flavor from the fish. 

The margarita was the only weak point of the meal, but it was still refreshing. Just too sour for my taste. I'm say we found this spot towards the end of the last day! Will def be seeing this place on the next visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good taco spot. Tacos were better than average but not the best I've had in Toronto. My bf an I ordered 5 different ones to try: chicken, carnitas, fish, steak and bulgogi. The fish taco was ok, not the tastiest we've had but definitely not bad. The bulgogi was the best one, very tasty and left us wanting more. The rest all fell in the middle - pretty good, no complaints. The most unique aspect of our visit was Wilbur's hot sauce and salsa bar - definitely extra points for this! Service was excellent, food was good. Overall I'd say a 4 star rating, with service and overall experience being a slightly stronger suit than the food itself."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had since the last time I was in Playa Del Carman Mexico. The mahi fish is deep fried lightly and stayed crispy. The multitude of sauces and salsas at the salsa bar makes the taco better and fit to your own personal taste."}
{"text":"POSITIVES:

-Staff is very friendly and helpful.

-Once ordered food comes out relatively fast and fresh.

-Serve cerveza!

-Atmosphere is energetic and lively... great place to go as a group. 

-GREAT DRUNK FOOD.

NEGATIVES:

-I've attempted a countless amount of times to eat here but the lines get so massive its annoying. So I just leave.

-I think the portions could be a little bigger... but not a big deal... still satisfying. 

MOST MEMORABLE MEAL RECENTLY WAS THE VEGGIE BOWL! SO DAMN SATISFYING!"}
{"text":"I love it here! It is one of my favourite Mexican places! 

I don't think you can go wrong with any of the tacos! If it's your first time here try the street corn or chips and guac! You tend to get chips with your order anyways but if you're with company, might as well share the calories! If you find tacos too messy, get the quesadilla.

One of the biggest reasons I love Wilbur's is the salsa bar AND the choices of hot sauce! There's not that many places that have all the options of hot sauce that are hard to find. Id suggest TAPATIO if you've never tried it before it's a good one! 

Vibe is good. Food is good. Will I be back? Obviously."}
{"text":"3.5

Pretty good! Can't compare to La Carnita or Seven Lives which are my personal favourites for tacos but it's a nice spot to come by for a snack. I'd be more inclined to come during lunchtime because the place is framed with huge glass windows so it's nice and bright! Love the vibe and the natural lighting.

If you sit-in instead of take-out, you'd order at the cashier who will then give you a number card to take back to your table. The food is then brought out by one of the staff. As for condiments and water, there is a mini self-serve bar situated towards the back. There's a huge selection so don't be afraid to go crazy.

Chips & Guacamole for $5 is great for sharing and I highly enjoyed their guac. For my own self, I had the Baja fish taco ($4.75), Pork taco ($4.25) and Chicken Tinga taco ($4.25), listed in order of preference. They're a bit small for the price but well-seasoned and I could tell that everything was really fresh.

All in all,  pretty solid across the board but no stand-outs. I'd think twice about coming back but I wouldn't mind giving their burritos and fajitas a try."}
{"text":"Literally my favourite place in the city to eat fast and cheap. 

Good quality Mexican affair with house made salsa, good vibes, and casual atmosphere. 

Recently tried the fajitas which are straight fire and filling. 

This place is a must. I wish they opened more locations"}
{"text":"A place dedicated to the pharmacist who measured the piquancy, or \"hotness\", of various chile peppers - an awesome branding idea!

\"Our food didn't take long to arrive. The neatest part about the presentation was the casually dressed waiters. For all we knew, they were simply well-dressed customers. Their outfits had nothing in common. We were warned about the fresh hot chips on the side of the burrito. The chips were extremely oily (to be expected, I guess). The burrito itself was good, but nothing overly exciting. It came with black beans, pico de gallo, cheddar, jack, guac, lettuce, sour cream and the meat. The Quesadillas were extremely hard to eat, as their red oily sauce was dripping everywhere. Definitely not something one should have on a date or a business meeting. Ingredients wise - cheddar, jack, chicken tinga, poblano (a mild pepper), red pepper, onion. It came with a site of a guacamole - an extremely bland one. Not sure why they were afraid to add spices and herbs...\"

This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"The place looks great. The salsas bar is amazing. You have many choices and that's the best thing this place can offer you. I tried the tacos but they has a sweet aftertaste...I really didn't  like the food. It's not either American Mexican or real Mexican food.  The deco And the soda fountain are really cool"}
{"text":"I'm all about the salsa and hot sauce selection at this place. The Cali burrito bowl I had was pretty solid too. I love anything with fries in it, so it was only logical for me to get the burrito bowl with sweet potato fries inside. 

This place is like a chipotle with smaller servings and a little more variation. Good luck finding a table for dinner service, but if you're persistent, you'll be able to nab a spot to sit. 

Definitely a great spot on king west and not overly pricey. You'd pay the same price for Chipotle, although the serving size is a bit smaller than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- interior is beautiful (so modern)
- presentation is pretty
- fast service (considering the location)
- free nachos 
- pretty cheap considering tacos usually sell for $5ea
- definitely the taco king of King St W ;)

Cons:
- not as flavourful as i expected (seven lives is still #1)

Food: i ordered the carnita, bulgogi and baja fish tacos and the mexican corn. bulgogi wasn't that great but i'd definitely go back and get everything else. (burritos are huge btw)"}
{"text":"Best taco I've had thus far in my life!! I ordered tgw pork taco and honestly,  there's nothing I can say to complain about it....it only cost $4.25 and came with an unexpected side of tortilla chips. It was pulledpork style, so soo flavourful, and was topped with onions lettuce and a house made sauce. The tortilla was really frah too....to keep it short, it was perfect. 
I also loved the much-talked-about salsa bar. About 5 or 6 jars of house made salsas to enjoy, many of which were very spicy haha! Plus,  they had about 70 jars of hot sauces to indulge in, I've never seen anything quite like it!
All in all, I really enjoyed my visit to Wilbur. Next time I return,  I plan on ordering a variety of their tacos since they're small enough that you can easily order 3 types to make a filling meals worth of food :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. It wasn't as packed with people as I've seen before, probably because it was a Monday, so my companions and I managed to get seats. The ordering system was clear and the menu was well laid out, so we were able to order with ease.
I'm one of those people to whom cilantro tastes like soap, so I was pretty apprehensive, but my friends assured me it wouldn't be overpowering. I am really happy they were right! 
I had the chips with guacamole and queso fundito and the Mexican corn to start. The guac and queso were tasty and filling, but the tortilla chips are in a league of their own; crispy, fresh, and good with everything! The corn is rolled in cotija cheese and guajillo chili powder. With a squeeze of lime on top, it is the perfect food to stimulate all the parts of your tongue. It is a must have!
I tried the chicken tinga and bulgogi tacos as well, and I was very happy with both. The chicken wasn't spicy but was still incredibly flavourful, and the bulgogi was sweet and spicy, the combination of julienned pear and sriracha crema working very well together to both heat and cool.
As impressive as the food is, the main attraction is the salsa and hot sauce bar. Over half a dozen fresh salsas and at least 30 different hot sauces are on hand for every heat level and taste preference. Very impressive! 
The one negative is that the music is so loud that it makes conversation very difficult, even if the person is beside you. Apart from that, it was a great experience overall. I even got a burrito to go, and it was delicious too! Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"The tacos here are heavy af compared to other tacos at more authentic Mexicana joints. Service was quick, and their sauce bar stole my fricken heart. I'd gotten the pork taco, and it honestly felt like half a meal for me (but I'm a pretty light eater in general). The meat was goddamn near tender and very filling. Recommended is three tacos for a full meal, but I was pretty anxious to try the corn- grilled and season to perfection. It's a great appetizer to share with one other person, since it's two halves of a corn. Definitely would come back for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Man I thought this place was going to be awesome because of the high reviews and I was slightly disappointed. I got the bulgogi and carne asada tacos and they were both a bit dry. I guess you're supposed to add the additional sauce at the side bar but I was hoping that it would have already came with the necessary sauces and different veggie toppings. The flavour is good but it wasn't anything special? I prefer La Carnita more.

I do like how they have a huge complimentary salsa and sauce bar and the decor is very open and the place has good lighting. It's also nice that they give you some corn chips if you order tacos.

Think I'll give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican spot.  Highly recommend.  The elevated fast food atmosphere is high energy and fun.  Food is excellent and I love the hot sauce/salsa bar.  I've tried the corn elotes and the burrito bowl and recommend both."}
{"text":"Went to Wilbur to meet an old friend for dinner after a long day at work. Ordered the guac and chips and the cali burrito bowl veganized. I received a steak burrito without cheese and sour cream, was really upset when I took a bite. I took it back and the food runner showed me the front lady hadn't punched any of my modifications in. He apologized profusely and quickly brought me a burrito bowl.. Which was seasoned rice with sweet potato fries on top. Not impressed for a $10 bowl, I'll go to chipotle next time."}
{"text":"Not coming back, tacos were cold, crispy onions on the carne asada taco were soggy. They deserve 3 stars because of their variety on sauces! I had the crispy chicken taco and was better than the carne asada, but didn't love it.
Good ambiance on a Saturday night, not as busy as expected. But for sure would pick other Mexican restaurants before coming here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian options and ended up eating half a pork taco. Enough said. They did give me my money back and a free beer, but those who have found themselves in the same situation know that nothing can make up for it."}
{"text":"My university had an alum event at the Spoke Club the other night and Wilbur caught my attention en route to said event. It's cafeteria style in that you go up, order, and then pay for your food first. For a Tuesday, it was really crowded, but I managed to find a table (shared with two other parties). The salsa bar was pretty cool with smiley faces indicating how spicy each salsa was. I had the 'Ghost' and it wasn't too bad by the way ... The taquitos (one order comes with 2) were really crunchy and delicious. We also ordered chips with both guacamole and cheese; again, I recommend ordering this as an appetizer. I had the bulgogi taco, which was pretty awesome as well. Wilbur does have alcohol so it's a good place to go out for a meal. Can't wait to return.

Good for: Mexican food, going out, casual meal"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of taco joints because of the flavourful food and super chill atmosphere. Wilbur Mexicana was no different and actually surpassed my expectations. We had an excellent experience here and will definitely be back! 

Although it was extremely packed when we stopped by, the wait time to get our orders in did not take long at all. At Wilbur, things are a bit different - you start off by ordering at the counter similar to a fast food restaurant, then you find your own table, but the servers still bring your food to you. It works out well and adds to the relaxed environment of the restaurant. A lot of things are done independently, including the self-serve salsa bar (which by the way is very cool). The food comes out real fast and the servers are friendly. 

From Tacos to Mexican Street Corn to Chips with Guacamole/Queso Fundido, everything tasted amazeballs! I'd specifically recommend the Chicken Tinga Taco and the Mexican Street Corn. Can't wait to try more of Wilbur's items next time :)"}
{"text":"I think this may be my favourite taco place in the city. The atmosphere, the options, the SALSA AND HOT SAUCE BAR are absolutely amazing! 
They cover all the bases you would want in a Mexican eatery. The decor is chic and modern yet still comfortable. You likely won't stay long as it's not a table service environment and the place is pretty packed, but you'll be satisfied. 

Did I mention the SALSA AND HOT SAUCE BAR?!?!

This place is a spice lovers dream. And with so much variety in sauces and additions you can customize your tacos, quesadillas etc. This is a really welcome aspect when you look at other taco places in the city that are strict on no substitutions and want you to eat it only the way they made it. 

Give this place a try for sure!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend their skillet dishes and anything burrito! The ingredients were fresh and loved their wide range of sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"I honestly have NO idea how this place has a 4 star rating. The only thing it has going for it is that it has a very nice and clean space...other than that, I could hardly call what I had tacos. The ingredients were like something out of subway...completely subpar. 

I had the carne asada taco and I'm not sure where they source their meat from, but they really should remove it from their menu, it was very rubbery and did not even taste like steak.

The chicken tinga was less disastrous than the steak but still very low quality ingredients and poor flavor.  

If I'm paying $10 for two tacos, I expect they'll at least taste like a taco. I wasn't expecting any sort of authenticity based on the look of the establishment, which was fine with me. I was hungry and craving tacos, I didn't really care if they weren't the best of the best, but oh boy was I not expecting such disappointment. 

I will not return here, I would rather eat taco bell."}
{"text":"I think what has stayed in mind about this place is the following:

1. the help-yourself salsa bar that ranges from mild to fire in your hole levels of spiciness and flavours.  The pineapple habenero salsa was great even though it burnt the heck out of my mouth.

2. the shelf of wild and extremely hot sauces to put in your food.  I had a lot of fun just looking at all the ridiculous names that people give to their hot sauces.  Needless to say that all of them will make your tummy turn if you are not prepared or experienced in eating these crazy sauces.

Wilbur Mexicana is a great fast upscale casual Mexican place in the bustling King St Fashion district.  The place was packed and with good reason.  

The chips with guac was good and the guac was chunky, fresh, and vibrant.  I helped myself to their all-you-can-withstand salsa bar.

The tacos were super solid and the chicken tinga and the pork was a great choice.  We chatted with a server and they recommended these as it was their best sellers.  They were flavourful and a healthy size so that made me happy.  The dining space is clean with a mix of high-top tables as well as traditional sit-downs.

The place as abuzz with activity on a Sunday afternoon and with the weather beaming outside.

Wilbur Mexicana is a great spot for a quick and tasty meal before heading out on a night on the town but stay away from the more insane hot sauces if you wanna live throughout the night. LOL."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some (take-out) lunch this week- fast and friendly service. More importantly the food was delish. I wanted too have something a little on the lighter side so I ordered the kale salad ($9), full of flavour. I also ordered a mushroom taco ($3.75) on a soft corn shell, it was spicy just the way I like it, and unknowingly all tacos come with an side of tortilla chips. Another great thing to note about this place is that they have a complimentary salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Man those tacos are good. Weird taste in the corn flour. Hot sauces x 40 to choose from and a salsa bar. Hip hop playing loud and twenty somethings with AD jobs with intellectual glasses on having a Monday night beer staring at a pub across the street. Too loud to over hear and hate them though. Also the root beer is great. Self seating high top only. Number 3 taco place which makes it number 1 of your reading your first taco review. 101 tacos is number 2 and ranch I relaxo is number 1. Unless you're rich enough for a flight to San Diego."}
{"text":"Salsa and Burrito sauces galore.

I was blown away by the selection of homeade salas, and sauces you can add to your burrito's. Not just your typical fare to, but unique one's I have not seen in any other place in Toronto. I was not able to try them all (there is a lot) but I mixed the pineapple one with the Chipotle sauce which was a nice combination mix of sweet and hot.

The Burrito's themselves were also tasty and fresh. Everything is freshly grilled that goes in, the burrito is nice and toasted and crispy (not soggy like a lot of other places) and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Yelp said try the chicken tinga taco, and so I did. Yelp was not wrong.

I had the chicken tinga taco tonight, and apparently I unknowingly ate a bunch of my brother's tortilla chips as well (he put them in my box. It's not my fault). For $3.75, it's not the cheapest taco around, but it's a lovely taco.

The chips were fresh and crispy. The red salsa was quite spicy. The brownish salsa was slightly sweet, slightly acidic, and slightly spicy, but these three slight qualities did not very much flavor make. I wish it was a tad stronger in all three categories. Then I would feel more like I was dipping my chips into something substantial, and not slightly flavored textured chopped up bits. The green salsa I guess had cilantro in it, and not being a fan of cilantro, I avoided it entirely.

The chicken tinga taco was lovely. The shell was crisp. The three main components in the filling were the chicken tinga (not dry in the least, savory, but almost slightly sweet as well. Did I detect a hint of cinnamon?), the cheese (not salty, but added a nice creamy texture), and the guacamole (fresh and avocado-y). Together, it really worked. Nothing was overpowering and the chicken was distinctly in the forefront. Good stuff."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food place in TO. Large space, reasonably priced tacos and self serve condiments. 

I think typically it's quite busy but I went on a rainy Saturday afternoon and there was lots of space, especially great since we had our little one with us. I believe bathrooms also had a changing table which is an added bonus for parents."}
{"text":"noting but good things to say.  good food and good service.  good Mexican on a budget!"}
{"text":"Super affordable, quick, and tasty! Also not to forget- located super conveniently in King West, so perfect for getting your pre-drink carbohydrate fix before a night of clubbing. The burritos here are under $10 and HUGE and very heavy, so you're a real champ if you can finish one per meal :) The salads are the same price and also quite filling and loaded with lots of healthy, wholesome ingredients like quinoa, chickpeas, kale, etc. If you're looking to share tapas style or for smaller portions, take advantage of the dirt cheap ($3.75) tacos! Vegetarian options are available! The sauces are self-serve and you don't want to skimp on these. 

Major con is how crowded and loud this place gets. You'll be lucky to find a seat around peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"Very cute place and excellent location. The guac and chips were good but the Baja fish taco had no flavour. The food looks prettier than it tastes."}
{"text":"Superb over the top service and great food. A longer than usual wait time but the place just opened up. Love the decor and the people are so nice. Menu selection  is great and love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I had read about Wilbur Mexicana while flipping through a Porter magazine on a recent flight. It was recommended as one of the new up-and-coming restaurants in Toronto, so I thought I would give it a try. As the name suggests, it's a Mexican fusion restaurant. The order method is quite interesting. Basically, follow these steps: 1) grab a clipboard by the door and look at the menu, 2) go order your food, 3) find a table to sit down at and wait patiently for your food. 

We ordered the Mexican Street Corn, Quinoa Salad, and 4 different types of tacos: Carne Asada, Pork, Bulgogi, and Baja Fish. There are also various types of salsas that you can help yourself to. However, beware that the salsas range in different levels of spiciness (some of which will bring you to tears)! I really enjoyed the bulgogi taco, but I thought that the Baja fish taco was mediocre. However, at $3.75 each, I can't complain about the tacos! The Mexican Street Corn was fairly good, but I've had better at La Carnita.

Overall, this is a budget-friendly place (our entire bill only came up to around $28!), and it's a quick way to satisfy your taco cravings!"}
{"text":"Loved the Baja fish and Carne Asada tacos! I also love that Wilbur has a sauce station as well! Service was also pretty fast despite how busy it got. Will be looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Saturday night. We managed to avoid the lineups and grabbed a table right away after ordering at the counter. Tried the chicken and bulgogi tacos and it came with free tortilla chips on the side. Tacos were good though the bulgogi was not my favorite. I'll definitely come again to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has above average tacos but that's as far as I'll take it. They aren't going to blow your socks off or make you crave for more. They do have a great salsa bar and the decor of this place is really cool. Living at the bottom of a condo, it has big glass windows with the interior having a fusion Mexican vibe. Definitely on the hipster vs authentic side but for a quick bite for lunch, this place won't leave you disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great location in the heart of King West, it's an excellent lunch spot with tacos starting at $4 inc tax. It's not fancy, but it's got pretty nice decor and great friendly staff. There's a decent cocktail menu too. 

Portions are decent and the food is goooood. Great variety on the menu and a nice self serve selection of dips and salsas. A total winner!"}
{"text":"These are some delicious tacos!  I tried ordering a variety of different tacos and they were all great. The weakest taco I had imo was the fish, it just didn't have that juicy, savoury taste that the rest had.  The hot sauce/salsa bar was awesome and perfect for picking out your perfect sauce."}
{"text":"Was first time at Wilbur and was expecting a Chipotle style Mexican place but was completely different. You order at the front and take a seat while your food is prepared fresh in the back and is brought out to you. It's a mix between sit down and fast food. High quality ingredients and very tasteful. Staff was very friendly and made you feel welcomed. The salsa bar was the best since you get free chips with a burrito and unlimited amounts of various kinds of salsa. Perfect place for lunch !"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Wilbur yet! I visit once every couple of months or so when I am in the area and have always enjoyed my experience.

Solid option for a quick service, Mexican-inspired meal. You queue up to order then take a seat with a number for the table. A server comes around a few minutes later with your meal. As for the space itself, there are tons of cool Instagram opportunities - the decor is fun and bright plus the food is pretty too!

For my vegan/veggie peeps out there, many delicious choices to pick from. Last time I visited, I got the veggie burrito with mushrooms - yum! Prices are reasonable for the area and the quality/quantity of food as well.

Really love how they allow you to serve yourself many various salsas, hot sauces, and water.

Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The salsa bar of dreams exists - and its and Wilbur 

Been Friday and Saturday nights around 7.30pm and never really had a problem getting a seat. The service has always been very friendly, the crowd is a bit on the yuppie side though.

Order at the counter, pick up a cute illustrated number tag and grab a seat. The food comes really fast, about 5 minutes

For starters I have had the grilled corn creamy and cheesy. My favourite tacos are the chicken tinga, big chunks of chicken in a hard shell and grilled avocado with double soft corn tortillas. Each order also comes with a side of chips (which can be a bit oily sometimes) but the best part is the salsa bar, with a variety to choose from with different spice levels. My favourite is the pineapple and the smokey one. There is also a shelf full of hot sauces, the choices and combinations are endless! Wash it all down with a Jarritos soda or a beer. 

I usually spend about $15-$20 for a meal."}
{"text":"I am from the States and thought this is the dumbest name for a Mexican restaurant....Wilbur? What the heck is that? How about Canexico!!

The Food was absolutely fantastic, the steak fajitas were delicious and my wife loved the Carne Asada tacos. I would eat here every week if I lived close..."}
{"text":"I tried this place because I kept seeing the artsy Instagram pics, the restaurant itself has such a nice take on Mexican food. Very modern up to date and nicely kept. Staff was amazing and helpful too! 

The food itself was like your basic tacos and chips & salsa. I did like the salsa bar though, definitely a plus point for the whole experience. They also had a really cool soda machine (kind of like a tap) so you could tell thought was put into the whole culture of the restaurant 

I tried the bulgogi taco (KBBQ) and it was spicier than I thought it would be but I loved it! I also tried the carne asada (steak) and it was decent - not as good as the bulgogi for sure. I LOVE that they give you a handful of chips along with any taco so you have a taste of two things. 
I also tried the corn with corjito which is like a type of cheese and it was pretty good. A lot of flavour in their food so definitely not disappointing! 

All together with two tacos, corn, chips&salsa and a drink I paid around 20$ which is a decent price in my opinion. 

Definitely can't say it was absolutely WORTH IT but it was nice to try something new. Do stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh burritos with a variety of salsa! Self serve and quick service! Will definitely return 5*"}
{"text":"I have been unlucky coming here numerous time. The first couple of times were unsuccessful due to maintenance closure, and hour of operation. However, I finally had an opportunity to try this place as I am a huge taco lover-- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I am in love with their sauce station and hot sauce bar. I love the fact that it is a self serve option with several different kinds of hot sauce. This is great because I was able to sample all sort of hot sauce without being a nuisance to a server. The fish taco was my favourite along with the nachos."}
{"text":"Great service, staff are friendly and quick with orders. Salsa and hot sauce bar available. Decent prices for portions and quality of food is good. Pork carnitas, fish tacos and guac/chips were all suggested and did not disappoint. The margaritas on tap are delicious!"}
{"text":"Always a good spot to go to for affordable and tasty food. The service is quick and the staff are friendly. No matter what time of day you go, it's reasonably busy so I DO suggest going with at least one more person so that they can find seats while you wait in line. One taco will not fill you, but maybe three will. The charred corn is sweet, juicy and roasted just right. The bowls are a bit customizeable (make sure to check which free toppings you want, as they are unlimited). The range of sauces are offfff the walllll. The avocados are allllways ripe. The chips are a bit salty (each taco comes with a side of chips), sooo the guac and cheese sauce are NECESSITIES."}
{"text":"My favourite taco was bulgogi not because I am familiar with the taste, but it had the most flavour to it. Doesn't mean other tacos were bad, they were all good. It is a quite big establishment with a high ceiling so it almost feels like you are eating outside. 
We started with guac + chips. I have to say those chips were not the best I have had. Some of them were too thick, so it was hard to eat. Guac was okay, nothing special about it. One thing I like about Wilbur Mexicana is that they have this huge selection of hot sauce and salsa (a self-serve bar where you can just grab what you want and how much you want). All the salsas I tried were packed with flavours. I highly recommending trying them! Tacos came with chips btw. Having guac+chips AND more chips was a lot of chips....but there is no such thing as \"too much chips.\" 

Overall, check the place out if you are nearby!"}
{"text":"I liked everything in this place down to the beats they were jammin'. Ordered a couple tacos all were scrumptious. Salsa bar is something I'd never seen before and also amazing. If you're looking for Mexican on King go here!"}
{"text":"Best Baja Fish Taco goes to 'anyplace, San Diego'. 

Best Enchiladas Suiza, Red Iguana in Salt Lake City.

Everything else goes to these guys. Flauta app...outstanding. Burritos...outstanding (tied with FB Burrito). Tacos...Bulgogi would be my new favorite, if not for a tie with the Carne Asada. It's true what they say. The secret is in the sauce. And the meat. And the creative combination of ingredients."}
{"text":"Pros:
Friendly Staff 
Comfortable Seating
Chips & Guac are good
Service was fast
DIY pop machine + Water Station 
Condiment bar - Hot Sauce Station
Cool Environment
Does leave you full by the end of your meal!

Cons:
Menu Hard to Read
Not Cheap
Have to ask cashier what comes in tacos/quesidilla
Chicken was sweet
Some of the condiments in the Salsa bar were dry. 

First off this place was not cheap - for two people, two quesidilla, two pops + chips and guac came out to just under $35. I must say that although the chips and guac was good some of the chips were stale. Half of the guacamole that comes with the chips was brown - turn off for supposedly fresh guac. The quesidilla was oily and the chicken had a sweet after taste too it however, it wasn't terrible. The best thing at the Salsa bar was the salsa verde and pineapple salsa (recommended that you try the pineapple salsa!). I wasn't fond of the pico de gallo - it was dry. The fountain pop machine had 8 choices too it and a cool retro dispense...easy to use however, not sure if refills were allowed (we got some anyway!). 

Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way..if I was craving a taco/burrito/quesidilla I would head over to Burrito Boyz which is much cheaper and similar in taste."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, my favorite quick eat place! Even with a line out the door you still get your food quick. Nice selection of salsas!"}
{"text":"Very good and not very expensive.

You get a lot of food and it is all fresh!

The line always goes out the door but that is only because the cash is right near the door. It moves fast. Just be sure to grab a menu so you know what you want when you get to the cash.

The fajitas are a very generous portion. Tacos are great and the salsa bar is a treat."}
{"text":"Alright, so let's Taco bout it... 
This was my first time here, my boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for a good price. 
The restaurant itself is bright, open and casually inviting. And the staff there were friendly and polite.
We both ordered; 
The 'carne asada'-with pico de gallo, crispy onions, queso fundido. 
The 'pork'-with pickled red onions, jalepeno-cilantro cream, cotija. 
And the 'baja fish'- with beer battered mahi-mahi, cabbage, pico de gallo, Chipotle cream.
Drooling yet?
And we grabbed a side of guac and chips. Also, they have a free all you can eat salsa bar, with classic salsa, mango salsa, blue corn salsa, fresh sauces, and a wall full of hot sauces to choose from!
The taco's were great! My boyfriend and I both agreed that the baja taco was just 'ok'. He really liked the pork taco, it had great seasoning and flavour to it. I enjoyed the whole meal, all in all. The service was good, the ambiance was laid back and enjoyable (along with the music), and the amount of good food we got, and could barely finish for under 40$ for the two us! We will definetly be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Holy Molly guacamolly I love this place, the food is super tasty and the Hot sauces woooaaahhhh are delicious. The staff is really helpful and nice. Love it love it love it. You must try it!"}
{"text":"Toronto has this crazy obsession with tacos and burritos. The downtown has like a new taco place opening like every week I feel. And there are a string of burritos joints and chains. So how does this place compare?

I feel the tacos fall short a bit on flavor compared to what I'd say is the standard here in Toronto in Parkside. The burritos, also falls short compared to a long serving burrito chain that is like popping up everywhere now and into the suburbs.

The burrito while grilled on flat skillet like the 'standard', the juices are falling out of the sides which make the ends soggy. The pork could use a bit of flavor too. The fish in the taco compared to the 'standard' needs to pop out of the taco.

The selection of hot sauces is a nice touch, though some are duds. The best part is the salsas, there's this green one with cilantro which is delicious and the mango salsa is amazing too. Try combining the green one with either the mango/tomato salsa, a good combination!

I thought the soda fountain inside was going to be some array of craft soda but nope, just your normal Pepsi products with two open spouts for something else.

One thing compared to some other joints is you are guaranteed to get your food and some place to eat (well seating is almost guaranteed but they seem to have enough space for you to find something). And perhaps you'll find some local celebrities. I saw a local city councilor who is like always in the newspaper these days!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday early evening around 5pm to check it out as I've walked by here numerous times and it looks good.

This is what I had with my buddy
guac & chips - 4.50 and it's really good. Nice amount of salt and the guac seems to have been freshly prepared that day. Good value for the amount you pay.
Baja fish taco - good, not the best I've had in the city. 
Chicken tinga - Ok, chicken tasted dry. 

Other good things about this place is the amount of different hot sauces that you can add and the walk up salsa bar for toppings on your taco.

overall, this place is going to get a 4 star. Really impressed with the decor and the pricing is amazing for king west location."}
{"text":"Incredible tacos!! I loved being able to choose a bunch of salsas from the \"salsa bar\" for free. And their hot sauce collection was awesome!!! Those two additions plus a central downtown location make this taco joint a hit. Have returned a few times and plan to return in the future!"}
{"text":"my go to taco joint in Toronto. quick, easy, fast, always satisfies my cravings. and yes, i've been to playa cabana, la carnita, Grand electric, etc etc. this is still my favorite and it's definitely because of their salsa bar - makes life. love the atmosphere and the music is always lively

my go to is the fish taco, always. i personally didn't like the steak taco but some do, if you like a chewy beef jerky texture, you'll enjoy it. also tried the chicken taco but it was just mediocre, NY opinion. fish is always a good idea. i probably come once every 2 weeks. the margaritas are strong ps."}
{"text":"This is just so close to my work I had to try it...I guess reading the reviews and seeing the line like crazy I had some pretty high expectations coming here...the ambience is loud. You basically buy your food, get a number, sit yourself down and the food will be bought to you...

The choices are limited. I ended up ordering Baja fish tacos which didn't really impress me as the fish was overcooked so it was more dry for my taste...there is like a mini sauce corner with many choices...spicy, sweet, you name it they probably have it... 

The guacamole was probably the best thing out of the menu in my opinion. 

All in all, I wasn't wow'd for the food and it was a little pricey for lunch...I may come back but not a top priority..."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Food was fresh, great ordering and serving system. Relaxed venue - spacious, with a modern-hipster vibe. Huge variety of salsas and sauces are included. I highly recommend the guacamole and chips."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tinga, baja fish and bulgogi (bulgogi = korean style beef) tacos for $2.75 each. The bulgogi was my favourite one (probably because beef), followed by the baja fish. If you're the kind of person that doesn't like things with a fishy aftertaste, don't get the baja. From the pictures I assumed it would taste like the kind of breaded fish you can buy at a fish and chips shop but in reality it's actually a lot different and tastes more like real fish lol. I don't recommend the chicken tinga taco for a couple reasons. Firstly I felt like the flavour of chicken tinga doesn't go well in taco form (but then again chicken almost never tastes good in a taco). Also the meat was very juicy which would be a good thing except it made the taco shell all soggy which wasn't very nice. Also don't order a side of chips unless you really want a lot because each order comes with chips already -- something I didn't know until after I received my order. My friend also ordered a side of corn which she loved but I thought just tasted like normal corn haha I guess it's a personal preference thing. When ordering here, it's really easy to rack up a large bill so next time I probably won't order any sides -- just tacos."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Overall this is a solid choice if you want to have a fun night out eating good food that won't break the bank.  It's a small place that's always packed but luckily they have takeout which is what my friend and I did.  We wanted to catch up and talk and in here if you're looking for a quiet spot you aren't going to find it here - it's a lively place - loud but in a good way.

The dark wood and the hot sauce and salsa bar (yes salsa bar!!) make this place lively and unique.  You can customize your order with your own preference of sauces on the side.  And not just any kind of sauces/salsas - they have a wide variety- mango/habanero; tomatillo sauce; ghost pepper sauce...you get the picture.  

We ordered the baha fish tacos (wasn't too impressed with this one); the chicken burrito bowl with rice (this was pretty yum but kinda reminds me of Chipotle); chips/guac (the chips are nice and crunchy) and the quinoa salad.  This was the surprise dish for me.  I thought it was going to be all quinoa but it's a mix of lettuce/veggies and quinoa which actually I really liked - the textural difference between the ingredients was nice.  I would order this again and actually I'm going to try and make it at home.

With taxes it came to about $34 which for 3 mains and a side wasn't bad.  This place is too far for me to come just for the food but if I'm in the area the price and the salsa bar will have me definitely stop in!

Spice up your taco!"}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar!

The line was out the door, mostly because it starts at the door. Haha, it seems poorly placed because it is a fire hazard. I guess it makes the store look busy though. 

The extensive hot sauce collection is really nice. The salsa bar is great too. Love the pineapple salsa. The guacamole is SO GOOD. The queso here was not my favorite . Very watery. It wasn't difficult to find a seat despite it being quite busy. I like how the glass bottles drinks are displayed at the counter sitting in an ice bed. It is also nice because when you dine in they deliver your food to you.

The carne asada was a bit spicy. It was less messy to eat than the fish taco. The fish taco fell apart with every bite.

Free water on tap!"}
{"text":"I really liked Wilbur Mexicana.  I am already planning on returning.  Wilbur Mexicana is a taco restaurant offering casual, cantina style food.  The restaurant itself is accessible, however, most the of tables are very tall and not wheelchair friendly.  The bathrooms are gendered.  The menu is fine for vegetarians, but because almost every vegetarian dish is just vegetables covered in cheese, I wouldn't recommend bringing vegans here.  

When I visited, the place was SUPER packed.  It took about 20 minutes to get a table, which we could only do once we ordered.  You order at a counter and then your food is delivered to your table.  If you're not into close seating or loud places, this place MAY not be for you.

The place has one of the best salsa/hot sauce bars in the city.  If you don't believe me, please see the photos.  It's awesome!  The food is reasonably priced and VERY delicious.  I ate until I physically couldn't eat anymore.  You MUST try at least one kind of taco.  

Man, just writing this review is making me hungry!"}
{"text":"Came here at around 4PM on a weekday and it wasn't busy, but definitely expect a rush around noon or dinner time (I've passed this place many times and seen how busy it could get!) My boyfriend and I ordered the chips, guac, and queso, which were really good! And they give you a generous amount of chips too. The tacos are okay- I've tasted better, but definitely order their fish tacos if you do come here. They also have a bunch of hot sauces and different taco condiments which I love! Their pineapple salsa is soooo good! Their tacos weren't great as I hoped it would be, considering I've tried a lot of other taco places in Toronto, but nonetheless it was affordable and still satisfied the craving!"}
{"text":"Best burrito place I've ever been, the selection of salsas that are free is what sets you apart. The decor is upbeat and good for the eyes. Staff is always friendly. For the price it can't be beat. A+"}
{"text":"Love the taco and the nacho, had fish and chicken taco, both great. The salsa bar has all kinds of salsa you can choose. Love the pineapple one. This place makes me want to go to Mexico. The downside is that there's quite a long line around lunch time, but you can expect that in all good places."}
{"text":"I think this is a great place. The space is awesome, and the salsa bar is great. The taquitos are heavenly and whatever that cheese sauce is makes my life. I think the tacos could use some work though, especially the fish tacos - the piece of fish is really huge, which is usually a good think but kind of overwhelming here. Overall, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pros:
Fast service
Fast food,good quality 
Great location
Fun decor
Variety in salsa 

Cons:
Busy location 
Not enough seating
Long line

Summary:
Nice staff 
The tacos taste good, not anything special but the service is fast and the salsa is great! 

Definitely a great place to bring friends or family :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my friend's favourite taco place, so I decided to give it a try. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. The service was friendly, but were not really helpful. 

The setting is very casual. The cash is at the front, where you order, pay and get a number for your food to come. There are large wooden communal tables and a few small bar tables at the front. The menus are hung near the entrance on clipboards near the entrance.

We ordered the chips and guac, a few tacos, taquitoes and a burrito. The chips were too oily for me and too salty, but the guac was fresh and chunky. I had ordered the fish taco, carne asada and the bulgolgi. The fish was great, but the bulgolgi was too dry. The burrito was good, lots of filling. It came with a side of chips but no guac, but there is a salsa bar available with different types to choose from. There is also a huge selection of hot sauces, varying spice levels and flavours. 

I will not likely coming back anytime soon, as there are many great taco options downtown. However, it's a neat little place to try out."}
{"text":"Went down there one Sat night. Chaos for parking....as expected.
Good atmosphere inside. Food is great....everything. They provide you with different kinds of salsasss. I loved the pineapple one. We ordered the Chips, Guacamole and Queso Fundido. So tasty that at the end both bowls were so clean it looks like new....:P The Corns were great too. As for tacos we got the Chicken Tinga, Carne Asada, Pork and the Fish. All good, but the winner have to be the Steak one. 
Price wise this place is cheap for their location. That's one of the reasons why we went back again and again."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a Mexican meal but I would have to say it wasn't the most authentic Mexican place. I would classify the restaurant as more of a fusion Mexican? 

Everything on the menu was good but not excellent, I felt that my quesadilla had too much sauce and the saltiness of it sort of ruined the actual taste of the meat and mushroom inside. 

Also, fun fact! If any of you guys are familiar of the Youtuber Estee Lalonde, I met her here! She was grabbing lunch while she was in Toronto for the film festival last year and it was such a surprise encounter and that is probably why I remember this restaurant so vividly LOL :)"}
{"text":"Awesome taco experience. 

This is a fast casual place, you wait in line to place your order then sit for them to bring your food so if it's busy (which it likely will be) the standing can get tiring but the food is worth the wait. 

We got a variety of tacos and the chips and guacamole. My personal favourites were the Bulgogi and the Chicken Tinga. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I've had their burritos a couple of times, which are tasty and fine on their own, and might be a shade expensive at $12, but the fresh salsa bar which includes pico de gallo and a pineapple halepeno salsa makes it worthwhile. Served with some chips. (But not too many, which is fine by me, lol!)"}
{"text":"Came to Wilbur on a Wednesday night.  As I I hadn't been here previously, I walked in saw a staff member and mentioned I wanted take-out.  Fortunately I was next in line and was able to order up right away.  I decided I'd go for the Wilbur-rito bowl with Chicken.  Paid for my order and asked the gal if there was an area to wait.  She indicated I could just sit right near her at the counter.  I also asked how long it would take, she said maybe 10 mins.  Within 2 mins a gal came with my order.  Holy Guacamole !  That was fast !  

Got the Bowl back to my hotel... Holy Guacamole again !  This is solidly good food !  The Chicken was grilled with a nice spice.  Rice, beans, cabbage, and even the guacamole was very fresh and still piping hot ! (not the guacamole).   

Overall,  Good ordering experience although when I started writing this review, I noticed others that talk about the salsa bar, and I wasn't told anything about this when I ordered.  I would have liked to have tried some of the salsa offerings.  I also noticed that when I was leaving, the queue to order was rather large.  I luckily got in before a rush.  I liked what I had and will definitely make the trek over there again !"}
{"text":"This place has shitty tacos that will make your face greasy.  Go to any other tacos place for good tacos cause this place is a waste"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, just walking home from the King West area. The restaurant was very appealing and I was delighted by how easy/simple the menu was. 
- Order in line, are given a number and the food is brought to your table
- I was craving a burrito bowl, it was a decent amount of food and it was fresh.
- A self-serve hot sauce and salsa bar with over 50 selections
- Great seating and open space, very clean urban atmosphere
- It was very busy for a weekday evening, but the service was fast and friendly
- The prices are reasonable considering the area. The bowl was $11.25.

I enjoyed the meal and the good vibes. Definitely satisfied my Mexican cravings. We all got burrito bowls this time, so I will be back to try the fajitas and corn. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The best place to bring a group of friends and snack on nachos and guac for a low price.

My friend and I shared a nacho/guac tray, along with getting two soft fish tacos each. The server told us that three tacos would fill us up, however we found that getting two and sharing a tray was more than enough. There was plenty of fish meat in our tacos and they were packed with sauce and tomato. It also helped that this establishment provides multiple complimentary sauces on the side, so it stuffed us up pretty nicely. 

I'm giving this a four star review because I did get a server who gave me a bit of an attitude when I accidentally ordered the wrong tacos. However, this was only a one time incident. Hopefully it won't happen again the next time I come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic carnita burrito and a very good fish taco I had here. They have a salsa bar with a plethora of sauces! Their pico de gallo is so good a fresh! I love experimenting and tasting all their house made sauces!

You pay at the cash after ordering and sit anywhere and a server will bring your order. Bring change to tip your server!"}
{"text":"This place had always been on my list of gotta try - when the line isn't long or when the place isn't packed. It has always been that way every time I happened to walk by until the other day.

So my friends, weekdays say after 2pm is not so bad.

Walked right and ordered my tacos straight away. Chicken Tinga, pork and of course fish. Oh my god....service is fast. My favourite part here is what I like to call the accessories bar. Can't argue with all the fixins you can add. I loved it. That section of hot sauce is insane. 

While you wait set yourself with what you'd like to add on to your tacos. It was great. My dream addition would be fresh guacamole. 

The chicken and pork were delicious but the fish taco was not my favourite. Sadly, I didn't finish that one. I tried covering it with as much of the pico de Gallo, salsa verde and lime. It was a bit too oily for me.

That said it's hard to go wrong here. Fast, fresh and for the most part tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. Baja fish taco was my fav. Chips and guac also excellent. Long lines but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out. The excitement definitely ended here.

My friend and I shared the following:

1. Chips, guacamole, and queso - the chips were warm and crispy, but the guac was too salty and the queso was too spicy

2. Mexican Street Corn - perhaps, I should have known that this dish would be super spicy based on the ingredients listed, but I wished they indicated it with a pepper or something. It was BEYOND spicy and I really could not eat this. Based on other yelper's reviews, I ordered this because I thought it would be amazeballs, but it turned out to be too spicy for my liking. 

3. Classic quesadillas - this was the best thing on the menu. It was flavoured well and filling.

4. Baja fish taco - this was pretty awful. The fish was burnt and the tortilla was dry. Save your money and go to grand electric. Still one of the best baja fish taco's I've had in the city.

Service was good. The food came super fast. It would be good if the music volume was lowered because I couldn't hear my friend that sat in front of me. I know this is the trend now so I can't really blame Wilbur for this. The place is really open and spacious. I liked the sauce station and the soda bar. The prices are cheap for a place on King Street West, but I likely will not be returning until they add spicy indicators on their menus and perhaps, some Mexican cokes!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. 
I'll say it straight out, I don't like or can handle hot/spicy food. 
This place was the wrong place for me.
All the meat is marinated in hot stuff. So I wasn't able to adjust the heat ... I ended up eating the cheese quesadilla. 
They have a bar of hot sauces. I didn't go near it.
Everyone else seemed to enjoy it.
They have great in-house made tortilla chips. 
That's all I can say. 
Would I go back? Nah."}
{"text":"Live a 5 minute walk away from Wilbur and absolutely love the tacos at this place. I highly recommend all the tacos, especially the baja fish taco. The one exception is the grilled avocado taco; it was really dry when I had it and would not buy it again when every other taco hits the spot.

Also, all orders come with chips and there's many different self serve salsas you can choose from. My favourite is the pineapple habanero one.

The place is loud but that's the vibe they want. There's bar, bench, and table seating.

Highly recommend this place some cheap but high quality tacos."}
{"text":"Really good tacos at a good price. Pretty big space, but it gets rly crowded at peak times. One of the better taco places in Toronto, def recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"This is Mexican-ish food. Not quite authentic but delicious enough.

If you go you MUST have the CORN -- it is roasted and slathered in a delicious sauce.

Some dishes are winners:
  - Street corn
  - Taco's (good variety)

Some are (consistently) not to my liking.
  - Quesadilla's are too dry

They have an amazing hot-sauce and salsa bar. Some salsa's are reason-enough to go there.


Some of the staff have been there for a while -- they look like very interesting urban hipster types. They are super-duper.

Some of the staff are just working there for jobs -- competent but they get tired and don't have much personality or make eye contact with customers.

A patio is said to be coming -- but it's not there yet so you can eat-in or take-out.

Service is quick and so far (after 5 visits) no errors. It gets *realllly* busy sometimes.

Fountain drinks (they have a few varieties) are self-serve and unlimited free refils.

Neat place! wish it was open late."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Best in Toronto. Sometimes can have line ups but worth the wait. These guys know what's up. Their seafood tacos are bomb. 

5/5*"}
{"text":"Overhyped? Maybe. The lines are generally long but the food is worth the wait. The massive assortment of hot sauces is impressive."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEE THIS PLACE! 

FOOD: I have been to so many Mexican places and I gotta say this is one of my faves! They have a lot of vegetarian options and the food tastes so good. You get a side of chips and free ALL YOU WANT salsa for main meals such as tacos and burritos. There are so many different types of salsas such as the basic pico de gallo to their own homemade salsas to the deadliest one \"ghost\" made from ghost peppers. The food is delicious, filling and aesthetically so nice! 

PLACE: Spacious area. You go in to order your food first, they give you a number stand and you can go sit anywhere you want. The waiters will find your number and give you your food. The area has a salsa bar filled with different types of salsa which you can get as many times as you want. You have to get your own napkins and water which is near the salsa bar. Love their layout and the independency of this place! 

STAFF: So nice, friendly, and tell you where everything is. 

PRICE: $$ Definitely affordable and decent pricing."}
{"text":"Love the casual, chill vibe & good tacos! Can skip the corn. 

Got the Chips with guac and queso fundido - what stands out for me is the corn tortilla chips. Also like the pico de gallo and pineapple salsa from the salsa bar. 

Enjoyed all 3 tacos:
Carne Asada - beef cubes with crispy onions
(Pulled) Pork - so juicy and flavorful!
Baja Fish - beef battered mahi-mahi, no taste but nicely cooked! 

2 apps & 3 tacos for  2 people came to ~$24 .. plus a XX beer for ~$6. Just missed the line around 6pm on Friday night."}
{"text":"We've been to most of the trendy taco places in Toronto like: Grand Electric, La Carnita and Seven Lives and were excited to try another one that advertised to have a DIY salsa bar.

Mexican Street Corn (2 half pieces for $4.50)
This is usually our favourite at any taco place but I can easily say that this was the worst street corn I have ever tasted in my life. The corn tasted like it was steamed hours ago and just reheated on the grill. No amount of crema, cotija or chili powder could save how mushy and gross this corn was.

Chips and Guacamole ($6)
Fresh chips with decent guacamole. Wish the guacamole had a little more salt and lime though.


Carne Asada Taco ($4.25)
Steak taco was pretty flavourful and the crispy onions added a nice different texture. Good portion of steak and the pico de gallo added a nice fresh taste.

Al Pastor Taco ($4.25)
Grilled pork taco with pineapple, onions and cilantro. Pretty plain and could have been marinated longer with stronger spices.

Bulgogi ($4.25)
Super flavourful korean beef taco with cabbage, matchstick pears, sriracha and sesame seeds. Definitely the best taco of the night as it was so juicy and tasty.

Baja Fish ($4.75)
Massive beer batter mahi-mahi that spilled over the tortilla. Topped with cabbage, pico de gallo and crema that complimented the deep fried fish well. The oil wasn't the freshest as the fish batter came out rather dark and stale tasting. Could easily be a must order if they kept the oil fresh."}
{"text":"Been here twice and couldn't be happier. 

Definitely get the Brisket Taquitos, Pork and Baja Fish tacos. If you get the burrito, please make sure not be too shy on the sauces. I'm talking: chipotle creme, queso fundido and asada salsa....mmmmm!

This place is so fast you can be in and out in 20 minutes. The food is well priced for how high end it feels. The staff are super friendly and efficient. And really, after it all, the only thing that matters is really good food. Wilbur Mexicana was an amazing surprise. 

They have a salsa bar that's filled with many homemade salsas. My favs are bean and corn, asada and the pico de gallo. 

We're definitely coming back. We're definitely happy that this place opened up in our neighbourhood !"}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to King West!

This Mexican eatery hits it on the spot.
Very innovative with the Salsa Bar, and large selection of hot sauces (I don't eat hot sauce but the selection made me want to test it out)

This place is really well lit and roomy.  You walk in and take a clipboard like menu to select your food. Once ready, you order at the counter where there is a selection of bottled drinks and beer on ice.  Nice touch.

What I really enjoyed about this place was the atmosphere and fusion of rustic Mexican with a modern twist decor.  The cutlery on the table (should you require any, looks and feels like iron and is made in Indonesia, no expense was spared on details)
 
They have an open kitchen, and serve you freshly made nacho chips with your order, these are delicious and a great added touch to your meal.

I ordered the Burrito with steak, sweet potatoes, rice and avocado.  Delicious!!
Everything is made fresh.

Staff is friendly, manager was on hand to greet patrons and make sure everyone was satisfied with their meal.  Price is reasonable, especially for that area.

Definitley a new place to visit when im in the area.

Great work guys!!!"}

High ceilings and spaciously arranged tables (read stools and counter height slabs of lumber) make this restaurant a great place for a casual meal. We visited as a group of 3 for the first time on a Tuesday night and was pleased with the quick service and there were several empty tables to choose from. We ordered guacamole and chips ($5), generously portioned with a huge scoop of guac. I think anywhere else would have charged much more than five dollars. The salsa bar and the large selection of hot sauces was also quite a novelty that we enjoyed. We tried almost every salsa available that night (including Ghost for amusement's sake). There's not much service apart from bringing the food over. Everything else (drinks, condiments) was self serve, which suited us just fine. Would definitely come back for some more chips and guac."}
{"text":"Amazing place for tacos. I was so happy not to be disappointed for once and Wilbur actually surpassed my taco expectations. The salsa buffet and collection of hot sauces was a lot of fun to explore. Any of their tacos seem to be delicious. I would recommend the chicken taco that comes in a hard shell with moist juicy chicken stuffed inside. La carnita was delicious also, they definitely don't skimp on the meat here. 

The only meh thing was the Mexican corn. The spices and toppings was delicious with just the right amount of spice. Unfortunately the corn itself was a little old and not sweet as I hoped it would be. No matter,  the food was still worth a return trip in the future!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really great when it is not during rush hour, otherwise it is still good but not as consistent in delivering their optimal food experience (i.e. burritos can be a bit messier and of different sizes than expected). 

Solid selection of salsas, hot sauces and customization options for burritos. Ingredients feel MUCH better and fresher than other downtown burrito spots - yes I am looking at you Burrito Boyz (what happened to your steak burrito...?).

The venue has a gorgeous loft look and the location is almost unbeatable."}
{"text":"After much hype, I finally got to check this place out!

FOOD:
- Baja Fish Taco (2/5): The fish was dry and missing that zing
- Bulgogi Taco (4/5): Meat was flavorful and had some spice
- Side of chips (5/5): So fresh and so good
- Salsa bar (2/5): Nice selection but the salsas were pretty generic.

ATMOSPHERE:
- I came here alone and felt totally comfortable. Quick in and out bite.

I would come back here only to try the burrito bowl and maybe grab a beer!"}
{"text":"Amazing good food! Nothing that hasn't been said or experienced before. It gets very busy so I suggest focus on scoping out a table before lining up to order anything if you have company. 
We had the burrito, fajitas, corn and guacamole with chips. We had a hard time finishing it all up between 3 people so portions are clearly very generous! The only minor compliant would be chips contain a lot more if broken pieces than whole ones. But that's not enough to deny them the 5 star rating they truly deserve! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I visited this place twice thus far. The first time I went, my friend and I had never been to the restaurant and we were confused by the concept/set up. At the time, they were particularly busy so we didn't get too much help from the servers. All in all, the food was flavourful enough that it warranted another try. 

In my first visit, I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. The dish itself is quite standard. The flavour and presentation wasn't particularly distinct or unforgettable but it got the job done. I did enjoy their guac and salsas as we also ordered a set of chips. For most of their dishes, they already include a side of chips so watch out! 

My second visit was much better than the first. The restaurant wasn't as busy and we quickly got seated. This time, I ordered the shrimp fajita which is one of the more pricier items on their menu but it was totally worth it. It was the perfect combination of flavour and drama. The hot sizzler plate melts the cheese which combines the different components of the dish such as the shrimp, onions and peppers. It is served with guac, sour cream, soft tortillas and some lettuce. To me, this dish is worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Between 2.5 and 3. I had the Chicken and Baja Tacos only. Not that different from anywhere else. Casual dining like Chiptole. Salsa bar is good. The Ghost salsa is really spicy. The guacamole was good. I may try a Bowl another time but it is too far to make a special trek"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for dinner, her suggestion.  The place is spacious with nice, large wooden tables.  Traffic began to pick up around 6:30pm ish.  The food was great, large portions!  It's not a traditional sit down restaurant - order your food when you walk in (menus are hanging to your left), take a number and have a seat.  Food is delivered in good time.  Would return."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place, from the way it looked (hot sauce station and fountain drink station were pretty cool!) to how friendly the staff were. 

Apparently we ended up here on a good night when there weren't any lines, because they're usually slammed. Thank you, rain gods. 

The food is what makes me give this place a 4/5 stars. It wasn't exceptional, and I've had better tacos but the spicy cheese sauce that comes with the chips is absolutely DELICIOUS. I would go back just for that! 

All in all, I would pay them a visit again, mainly for the vibe. I think ambience plays a key role in people returning and the food isn't terrible. They're def. doing something right. It's also priced fairly decent. 

I'd avoid the workweek lunch rush."}
{"text":"Amazing food, super cheap, best sauces, cool vibe, friendly* smiley staff, awesome location...

but..

...the ginger server tried to take away our plates before we were finished, and basically kicked us out with a forceful goodbye.  
There wasn't even a lineup of people waiting to get seats :(

Kinda soured the experience in my favourite fast food joint  :("}
{"text":"I really liked this place! We were a party of 6, and visited for dinner on a Tuesday evening. It's an easy, comfortable, relatively inexpensive spot for dinner after work, and we found it very easy to order (there are instructions as you enter - i.e. grab a menu, figure out what you want, line up, order, grab a table!). It's like a Mexican McDonald's (but better, obviously).

My boyfriend and I ordered: a) 3 tacos (the bulgogi taco, the baja fish taco, and the carne asada), b) the guacamole to share, and c) guava juice/soda. Our order came to a total of around $24, including taxes. 

Our order came very quickly, and service was relatively pleasant. As for the food, the ingredients were clearly very fresh, and the bulgogi taco in particular was full of flavour. My only minor complaint was that the tacos were a bit small, but other than that, everything was delicious. The guacamole was the highlight of our meal with the right amount of complexity, and those corn chips are nothing short of magical. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The Baja fish taco was very good, fresh fish and lots of condiments to round out the flavor. The pork taco was good as well, but not the traditional carnitas flavors we expected. My son had the original Burrito with chicken, and that was just okay-a little on the bland side and seemed to have a lot of lettuce and not as much rice and beans. Everyone enjoyed the spicy queso cheese and Guacamole with chips."}
{"text":"I'd pretty much lost track of how many times I had walked past Wilbur Mexicana without stopping in, so it seemed fortuitous that I was passing by whilst in search of a quick meal.

I'm a burrito guy, which meant I not surprisingly had to order The Original \"Wilbur-rito\" (\"steak, rice, refried beans,  jack & oaxaca cheese, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce\"). It's a simple list of ingredients that, unfortunately, results in a surprisingly (and disappointingly) bland burrito.

Don't get me wrong, it tastes fine; it was well assembled and the components worked fairly well together (although the steak was pretty dry). But the burrito is missing that oomph that one expects; it's completely lacking in heat and I honestly couldn't taste a single spice. It tastes like a burrito that's been designed not to offend anybody, and I just don't see the point.

I should note, however, that the burrito does come with a handful of complementary nachos, which one can dip into sauce procured from a small bar in the seating area. (I tried the tasty Ghost Pepper sauce, and also took a little of the rather ho-hum pico de gallo.)"}
{"text":"I had the Baja Tacos with guacamole, queso and chips!

It was amazing! Lots of flavour; love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us and I didn't know what to expect. Glad we stuck around - the food is amazing!  The Baja Fish Tacos were probably the best I've ever had.  The guac and chips were delicious. Wasn't too crazy about queso...not bad just not my personal favorite. Would definitely come back to try everything else. In addition to Baja Fish Tacos, of course."}
{"text":"Wilbur Mexicana is a great place to get a satisfying snack, or a delicious dinner. I am vegetarian and I generally get the mushroom tacos. I usually end up embarrassing myself by going a bit too crazy at the salsa bar. The choices of salsa are just too vast, and they are all so tasty. 

Another good choice for the vegetarians is the quesadilla. My partner is a meat-eater, so I usually end up asking for chicken on the side. It works out well for both me and him. 

An issue that I always encounter when I come here is the lack of seating. I feel like I am at the Eaton centre food court during lunch, hovering around people so that they can hurry up and leave. This place needs to expand!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food here to say the least.

This is a great find if you like fresh Mexican food. First off - be prepared for a bit of a wait (at least from what I experienced on a friday night after yoga). We stood for about 15 mins - wasn't too bad - a bit of a struggle to find a table so we just waited for a few people to finish up and take off. This is the only reason I docked a star - they certainly need more seating in this area. 

Food was fresh - we got burritos each (it comes with a side of chips and dips which we didn't even know since we ordered a second simple appetizer initially. There was more than enough food for both me and my large italian man (he can eat!). These burritos are roughly the size of a brick and probably close to the weight. You get what you pay for thankfully. I was quite satisfied. The lovely salsa choices make for an interesting and mini-buffet style meal. :)"}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious and so is there bowl. Can't wait to try more of the menu! the line can be long and seating is not always guaranteed! the vibe is nice."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places ever!!! I ordered the bulgogi, carne asada , baja fish and the corn ($15). All of which I enjoyed very much  The tacos were very yummy and filling, it came with chips on the side which could be eaten with the free salsas. Really great decor with a great atmosphere, definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look it, but you will get an amazing flavor explosion here. From their variety of sauces to the varied spices and unique ingredient combinations (who knew sweet potatoes would go so good in a burrito?), I was impressed. Plenty for what you pay, wonderfully satisfied"}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant I visited in downtown Toronto, which was the happening place on a Thursday night. They have on tap Paloma and margaritas, as well as beer and other non alcoholic drinks to choose from. The menu is pretty diverse offering fajitas, tacos, appetizers and salads. I ordered the taco salad and customized it by removing the rice and dairy (sour cream and cheese). I also added chicken to the salad. Shortly after ordering (about 5 minutes later), the food arrived at our table. The salad was no doubt amazing, and the chicken had a tasty Cajun spice flavour to it. I paid a visit to their salsa bar (complimentary) and chose to add the mango habanero salsa to the salad to make it a bit spicier. The overall experience was great! I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Its aight. I don't understand the hype. We ordered fish tacos, carne asada and a separate order of chips + guac. Also a veggie quesadilla that tasted like a whole lot of nothing. 

The fish tacos and carne asada were decent but I thought slightly overpriced and everything needed more salt - that being said, I do like a lot of salt on my food. The waitress also could have told us that all our orders come with chips and guac, so there was no need to order so much extra! 

I'd come back if I was in the area, but I bet there are better tacos out there."}
{"text":"I've heard Toronto's got a thing for its burritos and I'm pretty sure this place is that thing. Everything and anything I've ever had at this place has been nothing short of blissful. Just the general experience of this restaurant is a happy one. The system they have there works wonderfully in everyone's favour and the atmosphere is just crazy good! Definitely one of my favourite joints in the city."}
{"text":"You know all the details re: look, menu, ordering process, salsa selection etc.

All staff were on their game on this busy Saturday afternoon. Especially the floor staff. Great crew.

While pretty much every stool seemed occupied upon arrival, they turn over pretty quickly if you wait it out.

The missus can review her meal if she'd like (7/10 was her comment) but I KNOW how I feel about my \"Shrimp n shroom Quesadillas.\" They were fantastic. Delicious.  As in I will order them again next visit. So should you."}
{"text":"Currently not worth the hype,  but there's potential. Met a couple of my old colleagues for dinner on a Thursday night and grabbed a table for 6 at 6:30pm. If we arrived 10 minutes later,  we would have been waiting in line outside. 

Let's start on the decor. Modern interior with sharp black and white brick with wooden high tops and stools. It does feel like you're in a barber shop or some trendy mechanic's garage. The staff was friendly and seemed pretty excited for the crowd. 

The ordering process can be a bit confusing when the clipboard menus are located right beside the cashier and not displayed on the walls or near the entrance. Beers were displayed and cervazas like Sol and Dos XX range from $4-6 and there's a soda fountain machine that is uniquely something else out of the future. 

I ordered a baja fish taco and carne asada taco, recommended by the girl at cash. Got a number for my order and helped myself to the range of hot sauces and fresh salsas. 

The salsas were a disappointment. The pico de gallo was watery and held no real flavour of cilantro or lime. I also tried the asada salsa and that just tasted like mole sauce. The guacamole and chips are actually really good - creamy and simple. 

Our food was brought to our table in a bit of a mess. Instead of bringing each order by number,  all the tacos were brought out grouped by chicken,  pork or fish so all 6 of us had to figure out who ordered what. 

Baja fish taco: looked good but didn't impress. All I tasted was fish and where I was looking more for a harmony of sauce, crispy breading and cabbage. It wasn't memorable and I just remember tasting fish,  not a fish taco. 

Carne Asada taco: I don't know where to begin. I saw meat,  I saw cheese sauce and I saw crispy onions on top. This taco was basically a mess and the cheese sauce and beef shouldn't be together. I don't know if the kitchen is testing out their menu but this is not a winning combination and should seriously be looked at again. 

As a new restaurant,  this place does have potential to be really good but I think they should simplify their recipes or re look at the menu to make sure that each item goes out they way they intended it to be."}
{"text":"WILBURiffic!

Wilbur Mexicana is a very busy taco and burrito place on King St W that features a variety of Mexican fast food. They also feature a salsa bar with 8-10 different salsas you can load into a small container to use at your table of takeout. 

There are one page menus on clipboards that people can use to select their food while waiting in line. I had the Tinga, Asada and Baja tacos which come with some nacho chips that are perfect to sample the salsas. 

Walking by at noon time you'll see a line-up out the door. They have several communal tables but many people choose takeout and that's what makes the line long. After 2pm, the crowd thins out and you can enjoy your food at a high top while using their free wifi and listening to some cool music. 

The tacos were great and seasoned perfectly. This will definitely be one of my staple fast foods when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Wilbur several times and each time I've gotten the chicken quesadilla and guac and chips - hasn't disappointed once. BUT yesterday, I decided to get the quesadilla with ghost peppers and omg the best thing ever. It really isn't thaaaat spicy but it gave it a nice kick. Loved it. The quac and chips is also on point. Love the cilantros they put in the guacamole and the chips are nice and hard. The only reason why it is a 4/5 is because the service is quite slow, waited 15 minutes for a take out quesadilla."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with my Wife after seeing pictures on hypebeast on instagram. Pretty expensive for 1 taco $4.25 compared to other locations that are $3.25. The pico de gallo was watery. The only thing that I liked was the chips and guacamole since the guacamole was tasty. The pork tacos and carne Asada tacos had no flavor and tasted bland. Not authentic Mexican food. Tasted fake as in not Mexican whatsoever. The cashier who looked Hispanic (didn't get her name) was rude with her response when I asked \"how big were the quesadillas to share for 2 people\" by responding negatively \"4 tacos was a lot for 2 people.\" My wife and I will never be coming to this establishment again."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Wilbur. It's a good spot. The food is yummy and the portions are generous. It fits in quite well on King West. They have a few drinks. I think the big thing about here is the hot sauce stand and the condiment bar (salsas, pico de gallo, etc.). They have a decent amount of seating. The washrooms are clean. This place doesn't have an extensive menu but what they do have they do well. The prices are fair, though like most places in Toronto I feel like they overcharge for tacos. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fun cafeteria style taco bar - decent prices, good variation, plenty of seating indoor and outdoor and a delicious complementary salsa bar. Located in the middle of King St West meaning there's plenty to see and do walking around in the area. A perfect spot for anyone looking for a quick meal before any Rogers Centre/ACC events."}
{"text":"Visited on a friday night and didn't have trouble getting a seat. A hostess greets you at the door with a menu and gives you some information about ordering. You tell the cashier what you want, grab a number and then pick whatever seat you like. 

Ordered the mexican street corn, chips with queso and guac, and three different tacos: pork, baja fish and chicken. Everything was insanely delicious but the chicken taco and street corn were my favourites. There is also a salsa and hot sauce bar catering to everyone's spice preference. Downsides were the communal seating, limited drink selection (no wine) and very loud music. 

Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"First, excellent customer service. The food was definitely fresh although I wish the rice in the burrito was a bit better flavored with lime and cilantro or more salsa for example. However, they had an amazing variety of sauces on a self-serve basis.  I tried the jalapeno one it was really good. I also loved the young crowd, the louder music and the interior design. I would definitely come back with a friend."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend if you have a taco craving! Service is quick. Their tacos are really good. Cannot wait to come back and try out more items on their menu. Paid parking is available literally right behind the place. Has an ok amount of seating. Definitely does get super busy during peak times."}
{"text":"Came here with a group at lunch, and this place gets busy, but the line moves relatively fast. Seating is limited, but I think it's a grab and go for a lot of the customers. 

My group ordered guac and chops to start, the chips were fresh, and so was the guac (though to be fair, you can't plate bagged guac if it's its own dish). I ordered a burrito, which was basically the size of my forearm, and it came with more chips! The burrito had fresh ingredients and they didn't skimp on the protein. Everything tasted great too! The most exciting thing for me was the salsa bar, where you could sample a medley of different salsas, and add them to your order AT NO EXTRA COST (yes, this matters to me...).

The ambiance is higher end than most burritos places, but still has a nice fast pace, so it isn't weird to grab and go with your food. Service is good, and the place is clean. I will definitely be back for my baby-sized (as in the size of a small baby, not to be confused with baby i.e. small) burrito!"}
{"text":"I finally went to Wilbur Mexicana and it did not disappoint. I got two tacos: the avocado and the carne asada. The avocado was a good veggie option, but definitely needed some hot sauce to give it flavour. The carne asada was so good, probably one of the best tacos I've had. 

As a sauce-lover, I was so excited about all the different hot sauces and salsas available. They have them at a separate station, so you can take as much as you want without having to pay extra! Woohoo! This sealed the 5/5 star deal for me.

Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I like the place but lineups are getting long. Also, the margaritas are quite weak compared to when the place opened up."}
{"text":"Just tried Wilber again.  Second time was much worse.  I ordered a kale salad with chicken.  The order came out so quickly I asked, \"already?\"  The sever just looked at me with disgust and said \"yes\" then walked away. Of course I got home and no salad - completely wrong order.  The service at this restaurant sucks!   It definitely shows that they don't care about customers as I tried to call and the number on Yelp is not active.   They do not list a number on their webpage."}
{"text":"A hot sauce lover like myself definitely appreciated the fresh hot sauce/salsa bar!

I tried both the mushroom and grilled avacado tacos and they were nothing to write home about, unfortunately. The grilled avacado taco may have had a delicious pineapple salsa but I felt that this could not be thoroughly enjoyed with the overwhelming amount of avacado in every bite. 

Giving Wilbur 3 stars anyway because of the quick service despite the bustling location, affordable prices  and the aforementioned salsa bar."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for good but quick food I love coming to Wilbur! The first time I came here with a friend I was unsure about how good the food would be since it was supposed to be quick. But whoa it did not disappoint! 
Came back a few weeks later with my boyfriend who also enjoyed the fresh & tasty tacos! Ordered the Carne Asada, Baja Fish, Chicken Tinga and my favourite the Bulgogi beef taco!! 
As a salsa lova I really appreciate all the salsa & hot sauce selections!! It actually makes the experience better! Will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Grocery store flour tortillas. Chicken taco in hard shell was pretty good. It's just not a very good Mexican spot, even as far as hipster spots go."}
{"text":"I came here after a matinee show at the princess of wales theatre, around 4:30 pm on a Sunday. The place was nearly full, small line-up to order and looking nice and clean inside. Ordering was quick, about 3 minutes id say. App of fresh chips and a crazy good queso fondido took just a couple of minutes to,reach us. Just about 5 more minutes and our order of 4 tacos arrived looking very appealingly fresh. Flavours were honest, fresh, simple and delicious! I highly recommend the carne asado taco and bulgogi taco. Be sure to grab your self a ramekin of salsa fresca. 
I will definitely come back to try the rest of the taco offerings and and a fajita, if im nearby. 
All in, appy and 4 tacos, draft beer and a draft margarita, $43. Not super cheap but well worth it and leaving us both full and very happy. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great prices - it was $10 for a huge burrito. Interesting concept for community style eating - fast and friendly staff. And who doesn't love a wall of salsas and hot sauces. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great.
They have a \"how to\" section posted by the menu so it's very \"first-timer friendly\" - and the friendly (and attractive) staff are more than willing to help.
Pick up a clipboard-like menu, choose what you want, order, find a seat. 

They bring a tray of nachos and guac to the table and they have a salsa bar, and hot sauce bar, where you can go get as many different salsas as you want. 

I love the set up of the resto and one of my favourite things was the fountain drinks - free refills, and you serve yourself from a beer tap that's set to dispense soft drinks. Such a creative idea. Loved it. 

Food was on point and not too pricey. 

I basically loved everything about this place, from the food to the staff uniforms."}
{"text":"Yay for sucha nice fast casual restaurant! The decor here is super nice as with most places in this neighbourhood and the concept reminds me of a hipster Chipotle. We had the Mexican street corn and the classic bowl with Chicken. Both dishes were good and as my first time trying the corn after numerous visits to Mexican restaurants and failing to try it.... I was thoroughly impressed! It's a kicked up version of your classic corn on the cob. There is also tons of different salsas to try which is nice. Overall, the prices were also decent and the hustle and bustle of the place adds to the overall atmosphere. Would definitely come back again next time I'm in the area and craving some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Love the concept!  Cafeteria style. Tacos were yummy too. Good selection of beer. Casual and comfortable setting. Something different on King West. Refreshing!"}
{"text":"We had tasty tacos here in April on a Friday after work and it was delicious.  Surprised to see all the plentiful amounts of hot sauces and salsas.  Fast food casual atmosphere (like a fancier version of Chipotle, which I absolutely love).  Nice glass windows all around too."}
{"text":"First time visiting Wilbur and I have this to say! Great experience, friendly staff, they dont kick you out just becuase you are done eating. Nice and clean atmosphere and washroom, food was excellent and fast! I love the condiment options they provide. I got a chance to try all the delicious sauces that compliment the tacos and burritos. Price is standard. Definitely will be returning (even though I'm from North York area) but well worth the commute. Looking forward to going back and making this my go to place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the salsa bar makes a difference! It's lots of fun to mix and match different salsas - I enjoyed making a crazy pineapple salsa with a touch of ghost pepper - to add a personal flavour to your tacos. 

It's a casual, fun place to go with friends, and also vegetarian friendly. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"How can I not like a salsa bar?! Wasn't overly hungry that night so my friends and I decided to try out this place. I've heard a lot of good reviews about it so I decided to give it a try. 

First impressions - super young crowd, expected since we were in the King west area. My older friend said she felt out of place because she was older - lol. Very cool and hip decor that extends to the back. We can see the small kitchen from the entrance. They had some recipes on the wall for guacamole and pico de gallo. 

Food - menu had a lot to offer. Burritos, tacos, guac, bowls etc. since I wasn't super hungry I ordered two tacos which was quite enough for me! I tried the fish and bulgogi. Fish was good. Crispy. More batter than I would want. The bulgogi had a good taste but they drenched my taco with siracha so I was kind of dying from the spice. Your meal comes with a small side of chips so that's also pretty filling. I liked the pineapple salsa and pico de gallo. 

Overall I like the concept. Order, pay, they deliver the food to your table. You grab your own salsa, sauces and drinks, water etc. 

I'll come back again when I'm feeling for and snack and in the King west area for sure!"}
{"text":"Good tacos and the guacamole is excellent. The variety has something for everyone - as long as you don't mind spicy. The salsa bar has a better variety of spice levels (I stayed on the mild end!). 

Gets busy at lunch, but service is efficient and friendly. They have a small beer/cocktail selection along with some Mexican sodas."}
{"text":"I can't comment at all on authenticity (and don't think that matters every time), but a great lunch. I will say it's completely bananas, and I avoided it for a while because the line is just unreasonable, but at a quieter time it's pretty fantastic. Highly recommended the fish, and the salsa bar is a magical little addition. Mango particularly great with the fish. Super filling and worth the price in my mind (especially given it's King West)."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. The steak burrito was amazing and there are so many hot sauces to choose from. Good for either a quick take out or sitting to eat"}
{"text":"- give you nachos with order of anything
- free salsa and spice bar (to be used with nachos)
- good taste

Food: 
Ordered the burrito ($9 + tax).  They give you a wide range of options for meat, salsas, beans... It came with nachos and the buffet style salsa and spice bar. The nachos were a bit hard for my likeing but the burrito was tasty.  You definitely can notice that this is not a classic fast food Mexican joint.

Locale:
Very specious, large tables with ample of space in between them.

Service:
You order when you get in, they give you a number and ask you to sit down, they deliver the food to your table.

I would go here with a medium to large sized group"}
{"text":"Finally got an opportunity to try this always busy place. I was customer number 1 today! 

Place looks great but I'd argue that aesthetics came before function here. Lots of place to move a round the salsa bar but that leaves little room for seating. Maybe that was the intent, to show that it's hard to get seated due to good food.

As for the food, it's definitely above food court quality. I've tried 3 tacos: Al Pastor, Baja Fish and Bulgogi. Al Pastor was a little bland to my taste but have some spiciness to it that makes it passable. The Baja is not that good, though. The breading on the fish is so thick that I can't tell if there was any fish in my mouth when I dig in. Plenty of lettuce on top to mask the bland fish. Some positive is that it's edible :)

However, I would like to say that I enjoyed the Bulgogi so much! I wish that I ordered 3 of it. The meat is tender and the seasoning is great. 

I would come back to try some of the other food in the menu, for sure."}
{"text":"Everything is so damn good here. From the tacos to the street corn, the burritos to the queso and guac dip. The salsa bar is made fresh and definitely one of my favourite features of the restaurant. Service is friendly and fast! 

But the best part is the tall cute blonde girl who works at cash... ;)"}
{"text":"Fast and good.  We had the fish taco and shrimp and mushroom quesadilla .  Great self serve bar for salsas and hot sauces.  And if it's busy, just make your order take out."}
{"text":"Forget every flavourless taco, soggy burrito and unauthentic mexican meal you have ever chocked down. You're free of it all for you now have Wilburs!

Here is how you have to succeed at wilburs; 
1) Go with a buddy - the line up will be better that way and when you near the front one of you needs to vulture around and nab some seats
2) Order the corn. YOU HAVE TO GET THE CORN
3) try the pineapple salsa - it's insane
4) Feast! Everything on the menu is delicious and straight from the gods

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"}

{"text":"After seeing all the rave reviews on Yelp, I have had it bookmarked for quite some time. I was finally in dt toronto and had the chance to try out this place.

There was a line up (out the door on the sidewalk) when I first arrived. Line moved pretty fast, took about 8 minutes for me to be the first in line. Someone will give out menus occassionally for you to look at when you are at the back of the line. You will see plenty of menus on your left hand side when you enter the restaurant.

The interior is quite small and congested, reminds me a lot like Chipotle, but \"higher end\". 

You order at the cash and they will deliver the food to you at your table. Food came pretty fast and there's a salsa/sause bar behind the cash area where you can pick and choose and mix your own sause. Water (in a cup) is free.

I had the quinoa salad with chicken and it was just fine. Lots of quinoa (at the bottom) and chicken.

I think the huge variety of hot sauces and salsas are amazing, and the food was good, but there are definitely better mexican food options out there!"}
{"text":"The food & selection (4/5): It's my second visit at Wilbur. They offer very wide selection of food, including sweet corn, chips with cheese dips, tacos, quesadillas, burritos etc. I like their tacos the best. There are three types of tortilla chips: flour tortilla, corn tortilla and crispy corn tortilla. Depending on which taco you order, by default you'll get the type as listed on the menu. But this time I just found out you could simply ask for the tortilla you want without following their recommendation. I'll certainly do so next time since I like their crispy corn tortilla the best. Their taco comes with tortilla chips too but the taco portions themselves aren't so big. But also because of that you'll get to try more things. They also have a salsa station which you can just grab your favourite salsa as much as you want. It's perfect for the chips you get from your taco order. 

-Chips and Queso Fundido (4/5): These corn tortilla chips with cheese dip are so delicious. The dip is a little spicy and it's so addicting!! They give a generous amount of dip, so you don't need to worry about running out and having to eat just the chips by themselves. This is good for sharing between 2-3 people.
-Chicken Tinga with guacamole and cotija on Crispy Corn Tortilla (4/5): Chicken was nicely seasoned and worked quite well with guacamole. As I mentioned, the hard shell tortilla made things even better!
-Carne Asada with pico de gallo, crispy onions and queso fundido on Flour Tortilla (4/5): This beef taco was not bad either. The added crunchiness from the crispy onions was a nice touch.
-Bulgogi with cabbage, Sriracha, pear and sesame seeds on Flour Tortilla (4.5/5): I love the Asian fusion. The Bulgogi was really flavorful but the toppings certainly balanced it out. This one was certainly my favourite, but next time I'll try it with the crispy corn tortilla.
-Baja fish (beer battered mahi-mahi) with cabbage, pico de gallo and chipotle crema on Corn Tortilla (3/5): Not sure if it's because I ate this one after the Bulgogi so it made it really bland. The fish wasn't as crispy as I would want it either. 

Cost (4/5): Around $4 for a taco, so it's certainly affordable. 

Service (4/5): It's semi-self-serve. You order at the front which they'll give you a number and they'll bring you the food when it's ready. For water, condiments, salsa, etc., you'll get them yourself at the station near the back of the restaurant.

Ambience (4/5): The interior is nice and spacious, and wasn't too loud. The place is always popular though so seats are quite demanding. Expect to have to wait for a bit sometimes, both for ordering and finding a place to sit. However, since it's sort of like a fast food place people generally come and go really fast."}
{"text":"Gord and I had an early supper at Wilbur Mexicana.  It's been open for a while and it's the first time we've been there.

You order and pay at the counter and they bring it to you.  Gord had a Shrimp & Shrooms Quesadilla.  He said it was good.  He said he wouldn't get it again, though, because it was too drippy and messy.  Plus the verde salsa was overpowering.  I had a burrito with chicken (minus the guac and lettuce).  I love burritos and it was a good one.  I'd get it again.

One thing that was odd was they brought Gord's quesadillo out and then my burrito about five minutes later rather than bringing them out together.  So he started without me rather letting his food get cold.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for groups. You order from the counter, take a number and they bring the food to you. Most people eating there aren't lingering for long, most likely to grab a bite before going out. Its easy and relatively inexpensive place. 

The tacos are pretty good and I really enjoyed them. They're not meant to be authentic tacos, but they are pretty tasty (Got the Baja fish and korean beef tacos). The tacos come with chips. They have a salsa bar and probably a hundred types of hot sauce. It was fun to try the different types of hot sauce / salsas and see whats good, though you will probably never remember which one it is again since there are so many. 

Water is free at the back, but you can get beer and other drinks when you order. Overall a good experience. 

On the particular night I went, Kyle lowry was just standing there waiting for his order, before walking to his white bentley parked outside."}
{"text":"If I had my choice of my last meal on earth, it would probably be here. Yeah, it's that good.

My friend and I came by spontaneously on a Tuesday afternoon after learning Portland Variety's lunch period had passed and dinner menu wasn't available yet. The place is clean and the ambience is kind of hipster. When we arrived the place actually wasn't that busy, contrary to what other reviewers noted. The way ordering works is you're supposed to pay at the counter first, then you sit down and wait for your food to be delivered.

I ordered the steak fajitas and my friend ordered the steak quesadilla. My dish came on two plates: one plate with the flour tortillas, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole and the other with the still-sizzling steak. Food was 10/10 and really flavourful. My friend enjoyed his food although he complained he wasn't sure how to eat it with his salsa haha.

I also really liked the salsa bar - I thought it was really cool. (tip: try the pineapple salsa!)

If you're in the king west area and craving Mexican food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Was excited to visit this place, but a tad disappointed by the food.  Great ambience and a big line up to get in, but the food was all that great.

Likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in the city. Their menu is pretty expansive and have a nice selection of food choices other than the trendy taco. Ordered a quesadilla, guac and chips, Mexican street corn, and tacos. Everything was great, tacos could've been better though. Also this place has almost 100 different hot sauces to choose from which is pretty cool. Good service, good food, good prices."}
{"text":"Great store, great space, sauce buffet works! Got there just before noon before it filled up. Tacos selection and flavours fresh and carne and pineapple sauces condiments compliment."}
{"text":"This place is pretty expensive for a quesadilla, fountain soft drink and chips and guacamole total: $18 - $20. 

The quesadilla was tasty. I liked the grilled peppers and onions in the quesadilla and it was pretty filling. The Guacamole tasted fresh but when I got to the middle of the container it was brown yukkkk. It gave me the impression that someone just scooped fresh guac into a container that was sitting since the morning and sent it out. I was slightly disappointed with the stale chips I found in the pile of \"fresh chips\".  

The array of hot sauces is impressive and the self serve salsa bar was alright. I only enjoyed the Salsa Verde and the pineapple salsa which is must; the pico de gallo didn't taste fresh to me. The menu board up front should be clearer as I didn't have time to really choose what I wanted or understand the menu. It might be helpful to place a few menus on the tables as seating can be limited on weekends and line ups at the door seem to be common. I later found out that this place is known for its \"tacos\" I might give it a try.  I was expecting a little more for what I got as serving size is pretty small."}
{"text":"Amazing burrito place. So simple to order. Amazing hot sauce and salsa bar. Super filling. I love this spot for lunch or an early burrito dinner with a beer."}
{"text":"Great spot for Mexican food.  Well this isn't your authentic Mexican food by any means but they put a great spin on it.  Great atmosphere and good fast service.  Everyone was polite and attentive.  Food came out scary fast almost like they read my mind.  They had tvs and playing good music. 

The food was also great, tried the fish, steak and pork tacos. All good.  I really enjoyed the chips with guacamole probably the best guac I've tasted.  Also they have a lot of hot sauces.  Kinda mind blowing amount.  Wish I lived closer but probably better I didn't."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was overhyped in my case.... I went for the first time this past weekend. 

I would give it 3.5/5 because to me it didn't taste much different than any other burrito place. 

Yes it's cool that they have 40-50 different types of hot sauce. He and about 9 to 10 different types of salsa varying degrees of hotness. But those seem more like novelty factors than a reason to give this place A rating of 3 1/2 out of five or more.

The ambiance definitely was cool also cool is the fact that they have some light bottled beers, two beers on draft, as well as some Mexican sodas.
And if you just feel like water - you can pour your own glass near the self-serve salsa counter.

I got the classic Wilbur burrito with chicken and it seem like it had a lot of rice & a side of tortilla chips. I got all of their veggies that come w/ it but could not taste a trace of the charred corn. 

The tortilla chips and homemade guacamole did not disappoint! Definitely get those ($5)."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I eat out at Mexican restaurants frequently and I have added this to my favorites. Great environment. Fast service and great food. The chicken tinga is particularly delicious."}
{"text":"awesome. go there. go there now! open til 10pm. great tacos and salsa bar. get the signature steak, the korean kalbi, fried fish, and chicken. friendly service, order at the front, take a number, and they bring it to your table. im a local resident, been there many times - its best if you go before 7:30pm to avoid long lines."}
{"text":"Expensive, but of course it's expensive, its yuppy city. They'd be stupid to charge fair prices when so few of their customers know the real value of money. Thankfully, those who do can curb their losses by loading way too many mini-containers with stuff from their salad bar at the expense of not fitting in. But hey, if you're over 32 or not dressed in at least business casual attire, you already don't belong in that district."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Toronto like we were, I recommend going to Wilbur Mexicana near the end of your trip, because you may not want to eat anywhere else.  

We were in Toronto for 10-days, and we ate at Wilbur Mexicana four times. Not for a lack of options, King West has a ton of options within walking distance, but the food was so good we didn't want to eat anywhere else. 

The chicken tacos, carne asada tacos, and chips and guacamole were our favorites. The serving of guacamole you get for $5 was awesome, and we always had plenty for the chips (as well as adding some to the tacos). They also have a self-serve salsa/hot sauce bar where you can pack it to go or pile it on as much as you want. 

It's a short walk to the stadium too, so if you're going to a game and want to bring in some better (and cheaper) food than you'll find at the park, grab some tacos on your way- they kept well in the box and were just as delicious by the time we got to our seats and devoured them."}
{"text":"Second time here. Seven lives has better Baja, so does la carnita. La carnita also has comparable corn. I think the price point here is a bit cheaper than both. Also seven lives doesn't come with chips and a salsa bar. 

If they did tacos like either of those it would be my fave. But convenience really wins out here because its closest to the downtown core."}
{"text":"Pero donde Es mi Enchiladas y Chimichangas??? 

Sooooo another bland 'Hispanic' restaurant with nice lofty ambiance, OK chips and Queso but same ole bland menu catering to a group of bland palated individuals! 

Most exciting thing in the restaurant is not on the menu, no it's not the bland chicken Quesadillas or the bland seafood burrito.. it's actually a collection of mouthwatering spices displayed on the side and it's called the salsa bar with array of hot salsas and sauces, it's your best friend in justifying the amount of money you just spent at this place so go ahead grab the green sauce because the heat from the brown sauce will definitely make one's tongue fall in order to make this food taste edible...this bland 'joint' gets 2 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Food 4.5/5
Service 0.5/5
It may seem to the operators that having a massive lineup at all times whilst tables are empty is a good idea. The reality is that this is a clear indication of BAD management of the front of the house. Back of the house seems very efficient and timely. All the more reason to FIX the nonsensical ordering process. More people eating and fewer people standing at the door = more money !!!"}
{"text":"I came here around noon on a Friday. Waited in line for about 5 minutes. I ordered a chicken tinga taco and a mushroom one with a side of chips and queso. Even though it was pretty busy I was able to find a nice seat by the window. 

I waited about 5-10 minutes for my food and in the meantime I grabbed two sauces from the salsa bar (both were delicious). The tacos I ordered were perfectly flavoured and fresh-tasting. The queso didn't taste processed and the chips were nice and warm. 

It came to about $13 for my food and it was well worth it. The atmosphere was fun and the staff were really friendly. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what's all the hype about this place.  There's absolutely nothing special on their fish tacos...it was actually a little bland.  The beef taco was much better though.  Good selection of salsas and they give you a little bit of chips with your order."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and am always on the prowl for a good, reasonably priced Mexican joint in Toronto (yes, I've been to Seven Lives, and yes, it is the best taco in Toronto).  What I liked about Wilbur's was, though not the best best Mexican I've ever had, but certainly not bad at all, was the salsa bar and huge hot sauce selection.  We tried a little of everything on the menu and the guacamole portion was fantastic for $5! All of the ingredients were fresh and the tortilla chips served not only with the guac but with all of the tacos we got were wonderful!  I also liked the help-yourself water jugs and the option to have a beer with your sit-down meal. (Lots of people doing take-out here too) I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine had an amazing fish taco, and wanted to know what the other restaurants that had fish tacos on their menu were like. So we decided to do a taco tour. I chose our first stop to be Wilbur Mexicana, a restaurant I had heard a lot about for their affordable prices, large and open space, tasty tacos, and they also had corn on their menu - I love corn!

I checked out the Wilbur Mexicana website to learn more about their menu and hours and decided to ask my friends to meet me at the restaurant on a Sunday morning at 11:30AM -  exactly when they opened so we could guarantee seats for a large group.

Several of my friends and I go to the restaurant before they were scheduled to open, and since there was not much sitting outside, we were allowed in, which was really nice of them. Though when inside, some staff seemed annoyed that we had been allowed in a few minutes before they were scheduled to open, and that was unnecessary considering that we were sitting down in the corner not disturbing anyone or anything. It was only when were told we could order, that we got up and walked over to the cash register.

The process is:

Placer order at cash register - menus available beside cash register and on board above register
You are given a number/sign that you place on your table
The food is dropped off to you at your table
For water, sauces, etc., you have to get it yourself at the condiments bar (not sure what the official name would be). This part is actually quite fun because they really do have A LOT of sauces to choose from!

The Good

Reasonable prices - everything under $13
Though the tacos are on the smaller side, they all come with a side of homemade chips
The space is large, spacious, and with a lot of seating
The staff was friendly and efficient - minus the annoyed staff early on when we were allowed in before they officially opened
A lot of sauces to choose from which made it fun to play around with and test with our dishes
**Best thing on the menu? The Mexican Street Corn!! OMG!! Best corn next to the corn at La Carnita!

The Not-So-Good

The fish tacos we had were overcooked and bland which was sad since this was the main reason we chose to visit Wilbur Mexicana
No dessert options
Prices online are not the same as the prices at the restaurant! Update the menu online!
Overall...

We really enjoyed our time and meal at Wilbur Mexicana, and although there were a few hiccups - fish tacos were not great and service at the beginning was spotty - by the end of our meal my friends were raving about the food, experience and already planning to return later that week. And I actually did return later that week, and the friend I brought with me then also had a good time."}
{"text":"This is an expensive lunch, but worth every penny.  I would be fat and broke if I lived close to to this place.  I was in Toronto for two days and ate lunch here both times.  Good tacos, great guacamole, and more hot sauce choices than a bloody mary bar.

I didn't see it at night, but I bet it is a pretty laid back spot to grab some after work beers with delicious quick-serve Mexican."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Affordable prices for King West ($3.75 to $4.75 per taco) Quick service and good salsa / hot sauce selection. Not my favourite taco place but for the location and price, it's pretty good! 

I liked their fish taco. The Al Pastor was spicy and flavour wasn't as good as the fish. Guac is good to share with friends. We also got the corn as an app which comes in 2 halves which was OK.

The watermelon and lime agua fresca is refreshing for a summer day."}
{"text":"Finally. A place that is not afraid to go big on the scovilles!

I'm a notorious chilehead so Wilbur is right up my alley. Friendly staff, enthusiastic senior staff, great tasting food and reasonable prices. Even though it's on the trendy King Street W club strip, it somehow doesn't feel pretentious. 

You walk in, order from their simple menu and grab a table. No waiters in gun holsters, no tiny portions, and all the hot sauce and salsa you want. I like the rack full of all kinds of hotsauce from mild to stupid hot. Wilbur makes its own salsa that you are free to spoon up yourself and have a delicious ghost pepper salsa too!

Pretty limited on liquor so expect only beer and (I think) wine, but I honestly don't think they need to get a full bar. There are more than enough bars on the strip anyway. At Wilbur you go to have a casual much with your friends and a beer, but it's also perfect for a pre-night-out snack.

Try the Cali Burrito as you watch their kitchen staff through the clear glass aprtition cutting fresh hot peppers to make their awesome sauce."}
{"text":"Solid tacos every time. Consistent quality, modern atmosphere and good service. Particularly recommend the bulgogi and the Baja fish tacos. 

The salsa bar is a unique feature and has something for everyone from completely mild but oh so delish pineapple salsa to the dragons breath hot stuff. 

The Mexican Street corn is also very very good. We have had real Mexican Street corn and the one here is on par. 

The margarita is a bit salty for my tastes but some people like it. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"\"Meh, I've experienced better.\" exactly how I feel - IMO, it doesn't compare to La Carnita, Seven Lives, Grand Electric and several others in the city so I'm a bit perplexed by the ratings :| Their best selling point is their location and just maybe their salsa bar but even that is a stretch; they were just the highlight of the meal.  May give it another chance but with all the similar eateries Toronto has to offer, probably not."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a great experience.

We ordered Baja tacos, Carne Asada Tacos and pork tacos. We didn't realize the tacos came with a small side of tortilla chips chips so we ended up ordering a starter of Queso and Guac with tortilla chips as well. 

My favourites have got to be the Asada Tacos which were very flavourful. They also have a good serving of Guac and Queso unlike other restaurants. What I absolutely love about this place is the free Salsa bar and hot sauces. Great vibe and atmosphere with communal tables as well as private seating.

Ordering system: walk in and grab a menu by the door, order at the counter, grab your drinks and table number and find a seat. They will find you and bring your food. 

I will defiantly be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I passed by Wilbur Mexicana many times, but I went away when I saw the long lineup. Finally, I had a chance to try when I saw the line was acceptable. LOL. 

To my surprise, the turn over was pretty quick. We order the food and always saw seats available. When we were waiting in line, we got enough time to study their menu. The order process was quick and we got a number. While I went to get the sauce at the self serve Tabasco bar, the food already arrived. The service was very efficient!

We ordered three kind of tacos - tinga, fish, carne asada and shared chips with guacamole and queso. They are all nicely done. My favourite is the fish taco; the fish is very fresh and I could eat a lot of them.  Good thing is the self serve salsa bar and you can customize your taco with the additional toppings my favourite is the pineapple habanero. 

The only complain is I wish they will double the flour taco shell because the shell broke in the middle of eating the taco and was quite messy."}
{"text":"This place is all about the salsa. There are about 100 different options to choose from most of them being spicy, all come with the meal. 

It is a very peppy atmosphere with a great tasting menu. Even the chips are very good.  I will definitely come back here again with a glass of milk."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is GREAT. We went on a Friday evening and it was super busy but the line and service were very quick. My favourite was the chicken tinga (soft) but everything tasted great. There's a self serve salsa and hot sauce bar. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great unique place. Excellent food. Very reasonably priced. Can be very busy during lunch hour but that's usually a good sign. I tend to stick with the fish and pork tacos. They are right up there with the best of em in Toronto. Along with your meal you get some free nachos. Great part about this is the salsa bar you can try out."}
{"text":"Pretty standard taco fare. 
Service was quick and on a Tuesday night there were tons of open spots. Didn't seem like people lingered much. 
Two of us shared 6 tacos and that was the perfect amount. Standouts were the bulgogi and steak, the baja fish and un-original were a close second.
Plenty of salsa options to dress it up according to heat-tolerance levels. 
Spotted the sweet potato side option too late and although I'm a fan of anything sweet-potato, not sure it'd have worked?"}
{"text":"I love this place! If there is any restaurant out there with a trillion and one different options than this is the one. There's a bar of different toppings you can put into little containers and add to your tacos. The margaritas are a must add to your taco feast. This place can get pretty busy but it's worth it to stick around and try out the menu"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night, it wasn't packed to the brim but it was quite busy. Order at the counter, they bring you the food, and you get your own salsa and drinks. I tried the chicken tinga, carne asada, bulgogi, and baja fish. All of the tacos had a good amount of spice to them. The chicken tinga and carne asada were amazing but their baja fish tacos isn't as good. I much prefer the tacos here (and the experience here as well) over Seven Lives."}
{"text":"One Sunday we did a Taco showdown of 2 of the more popular taco places in Toronto.  We already did Seven Lives and Grand Electric (plus 2 others we wont mention).  So we decided to try Tacos 101 & Wilbur to see how they stacked up to my experiences in Chicago and San Diego.  

I know there are 3 groups of people who have strong thoughts about tacos... I'll just ignore the ones who dont like them in this review.  The first group is all about the street tacos... the ones you find a mom and pop shop grinding out the best savoury flavours for a few dollars and they dont look pretty but they're just solid with recipes going back generations.  Then you have the ones that are re-inventing them... using the shells as edible packaging to bring out new flavours and visual wow factor.  And then you have people who love taco bell... I'm going to ignore that group too. 

Wilbur definitely leans towards re-invention... bulgogi taco? kale salads? yeaaah not your typical street tacos.  It's on the nice and hip part of King Street.  It has a great chill and modern vibe.  The place is big and has that modern industrial aesthetics ... exposed concrete walls & pipes, polished stones, with big windows letting in light but it also has some great touches like the huge display in the back with ingredients and bold uses of yellow.  It's a nice vibe and on the weekends, it's pretty chill.  There's a decent amount of seating available from bar seating near the hot sauces to shared tables to smaller 4 seaters.  The restaurant is a fast casual concept so you line up to order and pay upfront but there's table service to deliver the food to you.

Baja Fish - One of the better ones in Toronto!  Served hot and crispy, the tender fish is battered and fried to a nice deep golden brown.  The crunch through the shell is satisfying and its well seasoned.  The addition of finely diced pico (tomato and onion) just helps it a bit.  Im used to having my tacos double wrapped but thats ok... good solid portions.  Like this version.  4/5

Al Pastor - Another solid taco with tender pork nicely flavoured and contrast with the sweet diced pineapple.  This was a generous amount of meat and definitely overflowed ... even broke through the single taco shell (this is why you need 2!).  I would say it's a hard decision between Tacos 101 and Wilbur for best Al Pastor. Both a good version.  4/5

Watermelon Lime juice - Love the fact the offer something else than just pop... lightly sweet but lots of watermelon and citrus flavour.  This was very refreshing and would be perfect for a patio drink.  4/5

Yeah it's not your traditional tacos but I do think these were executed so well.  The all you can try hot sauces and salsa makes this a fun place as you can see how much eat you can try before your eyes water and you're dying while coughing.  It's a great spot to catch up with friends and get some solid good affordable food on King st!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Friday night. I enjoyed the decor and atmosphere, really cool tables and very clean. I ordered the chicken burrito and a Sol beer. I was expecting something similar to some of the burrito chains but I've got to say the burrito I had was a new flavor to me and was very very good and filling. The nachos were a very welcomed surprise as well. I'm not from Toronto but next time I'm there I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow this is totally my new favourite place. Finally a good taco joint with reasonable prices and reasonable portion sizes! 

I actually managed to feed myself for $12. The tacos are $3.75 a piece and come served with a good portion of tortilla chips, so you can load up on salsas at the self-serve salsa bar and you are good to go.

The line moves very fast so do not be deterred by 15 people waiting in line. 

On a second visit I had the kale salad ($7) and one taco and managed to fill myself again."}
{"text":"Upon eating here, it is quite obvious that the people behind this restaurant have focused more on the design and appearance of the restaurant rather than the actual food.

The queso was not very good. Tasted like easy cheese. Also, it was not even warm.

The taquitos were alright. Good flavor.

Finally, the tacos were decent - but again, they were room temperature.

All in all, I won't be back. I don't go to Mexican restaurants for fancy design - I go for the food, and Wilbur did not deliver on that."}
{"text":"So I tired this place, full on success. I have the fish burrito it was amazing although I would of liked chipotle crema in it and I did ask for it but I think you have to add it yourself? Buttt it's a burrito so you can't really open it up and add stuff.... so a little weird about that one. It was also my first time so I don't know how it all works yet. My bf wants to come down again today to eat tacos I had to the bulgogi taco and it was very yummy very spicy but very yummy. I'm back to add that I got the fish taco on another visit it was good not too greasy but seven lives much better on the fish. But no one has the bulgogi taco love the taste of the meat very yummy still"}
{"text":"This is still the best eats in this neighborhood.

Fair price.

Hearty portioning (although the number of tortilla chips they give out with burritos has standardized and shrunk in the past year).

A sauce for any pallet.

Fresh.

Beer."}
{"text":"Recently found this place nearby and saw that it was packed! We decided to try it out and it didn't disappoint! The fajitas come in a hot plate with generous portions of protein.  Baja fish taco was delish as well.  There are a variety of sauces for you to choose from and you can try them all. Service is excellent even though it is a fast food restaurant where you don't even need to tip!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why this place is rated so high! Probably the worst mexican food I've had. Ever... The quesadillas were beyond dry and the bowl was very mediocre... I would probably give this place a 3 star rating for the nothing special kind of food.. However, I did find 3 pieces of hair in my buritto bowl and that really put me off. A piece of stray hair accidentally is sometimes okay but 3 is not. Gross."}
{"text":"Ok food, good prices and good decoration. Fast foodish type serving. Tacos were not particularly tasty but not bad as well. Fish taco was not good, pork was ok"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole this place is gawd damn delicious. We ordered entirely way too much food for myself and my fiancé. Two orders of Mexican street corn, chips guacamole and queso fundido, baja fish taco, pork taco and carne asada taco.

Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were very generous. We only spent 43 dollars on all that food plus a refillable pop and bottle of beer. 

I really liked that they had so many different hot sauces to choose from and a salsa bar. Service was quick and friendly. 

Best fish taco I've ever had!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here randomly one day and I was pleasantly surprised and came back soon after! The atmosphere was really laid back and fun and it was just a nice place to hang out with some friends. I really liked the guacamole here, everything is fresh and flavourful. Tacos were great, and the salads were not bad but probably wouldn't get it again. The salsa bar is really fun, I tried all of them and they were all pretty good - there was a good selection and something for everyone. Would definitely come back here for a Mexican fix."}
{"text":"YES! Finally a taco spot that isn't depressingly dark, crammed and they definitely don't try to run you out the door for the next table to get seated.

GRAB a menu at the entrance and make your way to the counter to redeem an oversized table number and get seated. Don't make my shameful mistake, keep that salsa bar on your mind!

SPOTTED:
- The atmosphere had a kind of canteen-like feel - very spacious and minimalistic with high ceilings and table tops to match!
- They have a fountain and salsa bar for your thirst-quenching and spice-hitting pleasures
- Mexican beers-galore! ($6~)

MY CHOWS:
- CHIPS, GUAC + QUESO FUNDIDO ($6.50) 
This was a nice pile of salted crisps with clearly fresh Guac and a cheesy, warm and lightly peppery Queso. Dipping my chip into the guac, then into the queso was my special combination ;)
- PORK TACO ($3.75)
It's in a flour tortilla, guys! My new-found favourite. It was Pulled Pork dressed with Pickled Red Onions, Jalapeño-Cilantro Crema & Cotija. So soft and full of flavour. Just my kind of pickle! 
- TECATE ($6) 
Very sweet. A blind pick...not a big fan of this beer.

Sad story of the week: 
I was actually absolutely out of it the evening I came in. Totally contemplating on rescheduling, but I went for it anyway. Ah, running on 50-hours without sleep is NEVER a good idea... and I won't blame the small tables for this one: 
A lift of my nachos tin sent my companion's beer spilling all over his beige bottoms, and, subsequently, my pulled-pork taco flipping onto me. 

Great. It was nice to meet you as well.

Wilbur Mexicana, I will be back for more of your (unspilt) goods."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the customer service was terrible. I ordered a fish taco and received a mushroom taco instead. When I told the staff they took a long time to double check my order and I was told that I was charged for a mushroom taco so if I wanted to have a fish taco I would be charged the one dollar difference. No apology and no concern for what I actually ordered. The food isn't good enough to go back. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The selection of bottle of hot sauce is worth that 4 star rating for Wilbur Mexicana! If you are a hot sauce lover like me, you would be excited with the selection!

I was here on a weekday late afternoon for a quick snack so the place was quiet and my meal was enjoyable. Fish taco that includes some corn chips were really really good, just the perfect portion. 

Love the salsa bar.

Definitely would be back again when I am in the area for a quick snack!"}
{"text":"Wilbur is delicious- a bit on the spicy side even for the plainest dish. They have corn based bread products, so even gluten free (ish) people can order from there. Their corn on the cob was absolutely delicious. The music is very very loud, and I found it somewhat difficult to hear the person I was having lunch with. The environment is trendy King Street West and expensive looking, but the food is inexpensive- 9 dollars for a huge burrito with chips and salsa- cheap!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their burritos but it can get crazy busy with your typical douchey King West crowd."}
{"text":"My daughter was begging me for tacos. So I brought both kids. 
The burritos were bigger than their heads. The staff was awesome, tended to all my kids needs. The staff even went as far to entertain my kids. The food was fresh and tasty. Kids are still begging to go back."}
{"text":"Super delicious went with my boyfriend who is mexican and he loved it! Better than many mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Yesterday's visit will be my third time and it didn't disappoint. My go to for Mexican food when I'm downtown Toronto. The ordering system is: order, pay, grab your salsas (which the pineapple one is my favourite!!), and they'll bring you the food according to the number they give you on a plaque. So the salsa and sauce and water is at your own service, but indeed convenient!! There are too many sauces to pick, so I just stay with the salsas. 

Happy:  Third time ordering brisquet taquitos ($6) as an appetizer and it was delicious with guacamole and a hot sauce. However, tonights taquitos seems to be skinnier than the last time I was there. Not filled enough with meat. It comes in a heavy small cute skillet which is appealing to the eye. I also had the bulgogi taco and the grilled avocado taco, that came with chips. The tacos were definitely fulled of \"stuff\" that it was hard to hold up to eat, so I ate some of the toppings with my fork. Dinner came up to $14 + taxes. 

Other times, I ordered their kale salad which is finely chopped up and nicely dressed with a vinaigrette. My partner loves the burrito and shrimp quesadilla. 

Not happy:  The price of the tacos increased from the summer of 2015 when I was there. If you come in too late into dinner/lunch time, there won't be any seats. However, the crowd is vibrant and moving and so people don't usually stay for too long (my assumption). 

Verdict:  It's a great place to eat and go and still be fully satisfied for what you pay for. Something different than just the usual comfort food. The washroom is big and clean - modernized too! You have to try it - and you'll probably go back too!  =)"}
{"text":"Tacos are on par with ones i have had in Mexico. Bold statement. Reasonably priced and carne asada is amazing"}
{"text":"Wilbur Mexicana is a great place for a casual date or evening with friends. The space is opened and bright! The tacos ($3.75 each) are delicious and affordable. The Mexican Street Corn is finger licking good! 

Wilbur Mexicana has an unique process for placing a order. 
(1) Place the order at the cash register
(2) Take the number provided to your table
(3) Order is placed at your table
(4) DIY station for sauces, salsas and water! 

I adore Wilbur Mexicana's condiments bar! Pico de gallo and pineapple salsa are bright and fresh! It adds a hint of freshness to the taco! Your order can also be \"protein up\" with black bean salsa at the self serve bar!"}
{"text":"I haven't really had a chance to give this place a review as I went randomly after work one day. One thing I'll say is that it definitely is a unique joint that is a little off from the traditional restaurant layout. Once you walk in, the menus are hanging on a rack right by the door and once you have decided on what to eat, you head up to the cash to order and get a number to place wherever you end up deciding to sit. The one thing that really caught my eye was the salsa bar with all its condiment selections which is rather different from the usual places I've been.

I honestly figured it would be a little pricey based off its atmosphere but I will pretty wrong about that. The food is decently priced for the freshness of the ingredients and not to mention the beers are not overpriced either.

I myself had the fish taco and the steak/chicken fajita. My friend opted to try each of the different taco varieties and we both agreed that it was definitely worth revisiting. I found my proteins to be very juicy and had a good amount of flavour while the tortillas were simple enough to not take away from the meats and veges.

I haven't been to many Mexicanas but Wilbur has caught my attention and made me realize that I should definitely give them more thought when deciding what to eat."}
{"text":"Tacos here are good but not amazing. All tacos/burritos come with a side of chips. The selling point has to be the wide range of hot sauce options and the unlimited salsa bar. No chip will ever be without salsa!! Ordered two tacos and was actually pretty full (thought I would leave still kinda hungry)... maybe because I towered each chip with pico de gallo..."}
{"text":"Love this place. So good and quick. I'd describe it as a mix of la carnita and chipotle. Fast and kind service and the chicken burrito bowl is delicious."}
{"text":"Best fast casual Mexican in town! My boyfriend & I like to think we're taco aficionados - whether that's true I'm not so sure, but I'll believe yes. 

You truly can't go wrong with anything ordered here. What would be wrong is not ordering the guacamole to start. Always so fresh & plenty to go around. 

The fajitas are great, love the carne Asada tacos & the kale salad. 

There's always a long line during prime lunch times but it moves quick."}
{"text":"Wilbur is a happening place around lunchtime. It has an energetic vibe each and every time. Expect to wait to order. There are tons of seating inside, but also seating for those who are waiting for take-out. I've ordered the steak fajitas as well as the burrito with fish. The steak fajitas is a lot of food and tasty. However, I definitely preferred the fish burrito. The fish is battered and light. There is a table with additional condiments and sauces if you so desire. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"LET'S TACO ABOUT WILBUR

Been here a bunch of times and left happy and full each time. My most recent visit I had gone with my brother and ordered a whole bunch of stuff. Ordering is really fast and simple and once your done you get a sign to take to your table. I recommend finding a table first then lining up as seats can fill up kinda quick. While you're waiting for your food, you can go to the salsa bar and get any or even all to try. Being big taco fans, my brother and I ordered almost everything. 

What I ordered:
-Chips w/ Guac and Queso Fundido 
    Y'all the guac here is the bomb dot com. This is a great thing to order if you want to try both the cheese dip and the guac. However next time I think I'm going to go straight for the chips and guac.
-Carne Asada Tacos
     Hands down my favourite taco from here. The meat was good perfectly not too chewy but kinda melts in your mouth. The fried onion strings on top add a great crunch 
-Bulgogi Tacos
    This one has sweet and a little spicy nothing that burns your tongue but gives a little kick. The pears in this also gave this taco a nice refreshing crunch. 
-Classic Chicken quesadilla 
   Comes with a mini side of sour cream and a guac (hurray more guac). This was way more delicious than I thought it would be. While I really enjoyed it, I did think it was really heavy but that may be from eating all these tacos. The mix of cheeses worked well together and tasted so so good kinda smoky if that makes any sense. 
-Chicken Tingas
   Unlike the other tacos, this comes in a crispy corn tortilla. This one was my brother's favourite. I on the other hand was not a big fan as I like soft tortillas more.
-Pork Tacos
    I wasn't really impressed by this as there was nothing that really stood out plus it was kinda hard to chew through.
-Baja Fish taco
   Compared to other fish tacos i've had, this wasn't really anything special. Upon biting into it the fish kinda falls apart making it more messy to eat than the other tacos. 

In terms of salsas, I recommend trying a bit of everything as each of them tasted great. My absolute favourite is the pineapple salsa, the sweetness of the pineapple cuts through the flavour of the meat in the tacos and gives off the most refreshing taste. :)"}
{"text":"There is a reason for the line out the door when you come. Food is very good and priced fairly. Even though the line was out the door, our order was taken quickly and we sat in 5-6 minutes. Fajitas and burritos were great."}
{"text":"Loved the classic \"Wilbur-ito\" on my first trip to this great little Mexican spot in Toronto! Very generous burrito filled with the traditional delicious ingredients - rice, beans, Pico de gallo, guac, lettuce (I got mine sans sour cream). I loved how I could taste crunchy lettuce that was cold on my tongue as well as perfectly soft avocado (also cold on my tongue) letting me know the ingredients are kept nice and fresh in the back. 

The atmosphere was very relaxed, and my party was greeted immediately by smiling and friendly staff. There is ample seating and free water, with bottled drinks or access to the soda fountain available for purchase. I didn't care for how loud the music was - the electronic music playing as we came in was obnoxious and actually required a worker to ask my party to repeat itself in order for her to make out what we were saying."}
{"text":"I went to Wilbur Mexicana for lunch and enjoyed a few tacos. The salsa bar is fantastic, so many options for every palate. When the food arrived it came with some tortilla chips, nothing fancy but a nice surprise. The tacos were good, not the best I've ever had, but they were okay and reasonable priced. I would go again, but wouldn't be one of my first choices."}
{"text":"Great new little spot. Chips and queso and the steak taco are stand outs. Salsa bar is a nice touch. Burritos are huge and quite tasty. The have a monitor that comes down that aired a raptors game which was an unexpected nice touch."}
{"text":"I really love the vibe of this place! The staff is super nice and you are treated like family when you first walk through the door! We ordered a Baja fish taco, chicken quesadillas and steak fajita! It was super filling for two people! I wished someone told us about the salsa early on as we finished half our meal with the complimentary guacamole and sour cream! Definitely give the ghost pepper salsa a try! There isn't much ghost pepper in there but definitely gives a healthy kick. Out of all 3, the best one was definitely the steak fajita! I recommend asking for a mix of steak and shrimp which we are dying to try next time! 

Overall super busy! Come ready to a line up and make sure you try their margaritas or their soda machine which is very old school and very good!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients and excellent flavour. I got the cali bowl and it tasted similar to chipotle however the steak here was really easy to chew and had been marinated. Chips were excellent as well and goes great with the cheese dip!"}
{"text":"It's opened again! Read about the long lines so a co-worker and I did the smart thing and came here at 11:30 on a Thursday to beat the lunch rush. Lines were wrapped inside the place by 11:50 ~ 1pm. 

Ok so here's how it goes down - it's like a cafeteria style: you enter, grab a menu on the sides of the entrance, place your order and receive a waiting number block, then grab a seat and they'll serve you your order.

It's pretty spacious inside but not too much seating. There's a hot sauce bar, salsa bar, and a drink station as well. LISTEN TO ME: try their pineapple salsa, I'm pretty sure I filled up an entire bowl's worth of it for my tortilla chips.

I ordered the chicken tinga taco, baja fish taco, and split the Mexican street corn and chips w/ guac and queso fondido (melted cheese) with my coworker. Each of us paid about ~$15 for our meal and we were both stuffed. I'd recommend ordering 2 tacos and splitting an appetizer - don't worry, it'll fill you up.

Nothing too special about the food, it's good and they give pretty generous portions - yesss load up that guac! Oh, PS - you can get booze here too.

Overall a great casual spot to grab a quick bite. If it's one thing to take away from this review, it's to try their pineapple salsa!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual lunch spots when I was working around the area. Love love love the ambiance of the place! My favorite part about the place is the self serve salsa and hot sauce station, they range from different levels of spiciness. Whenever you order tacos they come with a side of chips, perfect for their get-as-much-as-you-want salsa! Pineapple salsa was my favorite, adds a lot of sweetness and just enough tartness to your tacos.  Don't forget about their street corn, great flavor profile, just to add, I think it would taste better if it was served hot or at least warm. When mine got to me, it was close to room temp or cold."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple times now. We haven't had to wait either time we went. The tacos were fresh and their salsa bar was extensive. They have at least 5 different freshly made salsas out for you to try. They also have a huge hot sauce bar. I think that my favorite thing I have ordered there has been the corn. I asked for it to be \"off the cob\". It was cheesy and delicious. Their tacos are good, though, nothing to write home about. 

The things that I didn't love however, was the fact that they only served beer, I was shocked at a Mexican joint (that serves alcohol) but no margaritas! The other thing that I didn't love was their guac and cheese dip. Their guac tasted as if it came straight from a bag from a wholesaler and their cheese dip was what not what I expect at a Mexican place, it was more like a spicy nacho sauce... 

Overall, it was cheap, quick, and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was delicious. It's a good fun experience. I would recommend asking them for extra tortillas and for corn tortillas if you do the fajita. They come in handy!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love delicious tacos, chips, guac and free salsa and sauces?! Really flavorful chicken and pork in our tacos and burritos. Prices are great and they all come with tortilla chips and they have a bar of salsas and sauces. I highly recommend this place as it was one of the best parts of my 2 weeks in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Although a little pricey, I like Wilbur Mexicana for their tasty tacos. So far tried their chicken, bulgogi and pork, but my favorite has to be the chicken with guacamole. I found the bulgogi to be somewhat spicy while the pork was alright. 

Wilbur has a unique fast casual vibe that's great for those looking for a quick bite or want to sit in for a bit. The coolest feature was their massive selection of hot sauce and variety of salsa to choose from for your tacos or nachos. Just be careful of the ghost pepper sauces!"}
{"text":"I live near by and am so happy to have this place around, as I find myself often craving their food! It's fast food, but fancier somehow. And more fun. They have a free salsa bar for you to access their many many many salsas and hot sauces. So fun. Plus even if you just order a burrito, chips are free! Portions are great. Ambiance is wonderful - very lively - friendly staff. Can get very busy, but you can always opt for takeaway. Plus Guacamole comes free! Finally someone understands!!!!!!

My only negatives...they seem to be upping the prices - since they opened, but it's still worth it. Also, tried the quesadilla. Less than impressed. I'm sticking with my yummy burrito!"}
{"text":"came to this place because of \"blogto's\" recommendation. 

if your not paying attention to finding this place, you will miss it. on the outside it looks like a stubby condo LOL

all joking aside, its an amazing restaurant, we came for cheap tacos and was amazed with the flavor. 

i think we had every serving of taco available and the baja fish burrito...they charge more for it, but absolutely amazing. i was drawn to how bright this place really is, all of the white makes it look like a surgical room, but in the best way possible. 
they have a fountain station with a tap(like the kind that is hooked up to a keg) 
they boast over 50 bottles of hot sauces for common use with anything you order, most of them are blah, some real gems in there though. the salsa bar is amazing, self serve in fish bowls, over 75% of these flavors, kick some serious butt, and pack some serious heat. which i loved so much. i literally wanted to take one home. 

everything we tried was extremely good, from the tacos, to the burritoes, the chips, and the taquitos(highly recommended)

all of the staff were super friendly and super quick with delivering food and clearing the tables.

amazing flavor(some things came with cilantro, personally i hate cilantro, but its balanced with other flavors, somewhat unnoticeable), great price and amazing portions."}
{"text":"Delicious! Always happy to eat here. Solid mushroom tacos. Queso is a must have. Most delicious cheese I have had. Watch out, not always consistent and can be incredibly spicy depending on how many jalapenoes they use that day.

Great place for a quick Mexican meal, but can be very busy with long lines.

Also, they have a salsa & hot sauce bar. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had for a long time! Food, staff, atmosphere- great! Recommendable for sure!"}
