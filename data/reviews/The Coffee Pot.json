{"text":"The staff was friendly and very hardworking, but unfortunately didn't have enough help which meant we had to wait over 10 minutes to order our food and 30 more minutes to get our breakfast. The food was lukewarm when we got it and the pancakes were mushy. The pancakes may be prepared that way, but it wasn't to my liking."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. It's a good and inexpensive breakfast.

But it's the atmosphere that sets it apart. It's family run and local and you feel both while you're there."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a location. Food was good small spot makes me feel like back at home in Dallas.  Friendly staffs.  Went during lunch. It was a little busy took awhile for the food to come out but other then that good place overall. Three stars only because of the wait time a little over an hour for the food to come out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened upon this place while walking home on a rough morning, and it was the perfect place to stop and take a breath. 

The menu was simple and traditional, but very fairly priced. Our waitress was friendly and efficient; our food was well prepared and appeared on the table within a few minutes of ordering. I definitely plan on going back to this little diner.

Just watch your head if you need to visit the bathroom - it's an adventure through the kitchen and into the basement!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast joint.  Friendly and quick service, inexpensive, and all-around good food.  The Coffee Pot boasts some of the BEST toast I have ever eaten.  I don't know how they do it.  I could eat three or four platefuls every time I go in.  

I'm not an egg-eater, so I can't testify to their omelettes.  But I absolutely love their potato pancakes, and their bacon is perfect -- not too crispy, not too fatty.  Their pancakes are huge, stick to the short stack.  

And they're not just a breakfast place, though they serve breakfast all day.  They also make good burgers and chicken salad -- but the fish sandwich is my favorite.  Fries come seasoned with pepper, but not with every entree.

Closed on Mondays, but no problem for us, who are more often weekend diner-goers.

If you live in Lakewood, or drive through often, and haven't been to The Coffee Pot...well.  You're missing out on something fabulous."}
{"text":"Absolutely filthy. Are you guys kidding me?!  Walked In, sat down, was completely disgusted, then left. I can not talk about the food, I was way to grossed out to eat it, but the restaurant itself was horrible. Filth everywhere. Clean it up and it's probably a decent place. Until then, nasty..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a close quarters comfort food breakfast then go here. Food was okay, people were friendly. The price is right for food quality..."}
{"text":"To start off, the food was excellent. Unfortunately, that was the only positive. 

This place is in a serious need of a deep cleaning. The floors in the dining area were absolutely disgusting. 

As far as our server went, we didn't hear from her after she took our order. Not that she was in the mindset to serve anybody. Her priority was to park herself at the counter, read the newspaper, and gossip with probably another useless member of the team. 

The only people who were motivated there was a lady who I think was the owner, her son?, and the person cooking. 

I saw that only one person was in the kitchen, so I expected a delay in getting the food to my table. The downfall to that is I was able to observe the condition of the entire operation. 

Will I go back? Probably not until that place receives a deep scrub down."}
{"text":"About the closest to breakfast perfection I've ever experienced. Your coffee is hot, the decor is crappy and kitschy, and the food is great. You sit intimately close to almost everyone - I preferred the counter, which still has the original fixtures from probably 60 years ago. Grab a newspaper and start a conversation with someone, probably from the neighborhood. You've got the time if you're here. 

The service is not fast. There are plenty of places to get fast service and this is not one of them. Not the style of this place. 

The corned beef hash is done very well, and the potato pancakes are great too. Make sure to ask for applesauce and sour cream."}
{"text":"Tiny place, hot coffee, big omelettes- I can't complain. We walked right in and got a comfortable seat right in the middle of the restaurant. The service was no-nonsense with the most basic conversation- perfect for the pre-coffee haze. The coffee was hot and topped off plenty. It tasted fresh. The best part was my omelette. The omelette was huge and reasonably priced, which was just what I needed. The atmosphere is very hole-in-the-wall, calm, almost tired. Its a great simple diner, a great escape from some of the more eccentric or heavily-trafficked breakfast destinations around. Its a simple experience, and definitely worth having in the morning."}
{"text":"We LOVE The Coffee Pot. This little diner has the best breakfast at the best price. We get the hangover special which is everything I want: one (amazing) pancake, one bacon, hash browns, one egg, a coffee and orange juice all for $5.50. Its a family run operation and someone is always warming up our coffees with a smile. We usually get our food in 20 minutes or so, which I don't think is unreasonable. Its a bit run down, but the tables and dishes are clean, the food is fabulous and the owners are friendly. Yum!"}
{"text":"The best place in Lakewood for breakfast.  Only two women wait there and they know what they are doing.  Your coffee will always be full and the food is awesome. 

Super inexpensive as well.  The banana-can pancakes will change your life."}
{"text":"I stopped here for brunch last Sunday and really liked it.
Don't come here expecting anything fancy.  It is a basic diner with large portions of tastey food and a very friendly staff.

I sat at the counter and worked on a paper for grad school and felt very comfortable.  Sometimes it can feel awkward eating by yourself.

I will have to echo what others have said in their reviews, the hashbrowns are awesome.  I got an omelet with corned beef and mozzarella (I don't like swiss).  The corned beef was a little dry and there was a bit too much mozzarella, but I still enjoyed it.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tiny but tasty. Good coffee and never had a bad breakfast. Old school vibe. One of my favs in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"40 minutes for an omlette and an unprofessional cook confused by multiple tickets, easily distracted by the 3 (!) dishwashers talking loud enough about their weekend we ALL got to hear.  Keep trying to like this place but the owner is consistently short-changed by the cook...plenty of other Yelp reviews saying the same and asking her to make a change.  When my otherwise apologetic waitress told the cook the order was too long and the customer leaving, he said \"I don't care...are you splittin' your tips with me?...didnt think so....\"  Why is this guy on your staff?  Why so many dishwashers?"}
{"text":"So much delicious food for such a low cost! It doesn't look like much, but the coffee is always hot, the food comes out fast, they have Pepsi AND Coke, and the potatoes are the best in the greater CLE area."}
{"text":"Love this place for its cheap breakfast and relaxed atmosphere! The ladies that work there are always super friendly and provide great service. The food is nothing fancy, but it definitely hits the spot for a inexpensive breakfast. And for a hole-in-the-wall, greasy-spoon type joint, the coffee is really good :)"}
{"text":"First off- painfully slow service. 

Secondly- my girlfriends coffee creamers curdled in her coffee. When told about this our server just told her to stir it it and that that was normal. 

Thirdly- the place is a dump. Table was dirty. Silver was dirty. Water glass was dirty. It's not divey, it's not a staple, it's not a greasy spoon. It's gross. 

Poor service and dirty. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The employees treat you like they would treat family. The food and prices are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place around!! The pancakes are hands down the best pancakes I've ever had not to mention their hash-browns are amazing as well. I've tried something different there every time and have yet to be disappointed. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to the Coffee Pot for a year and a half now and I have NEVER been disappointed with the food or service.

Ive seen a lot of reviews complaining about the slow service, uh, there is one person cooking in that kitchen! Of course youre going to have to wait. 
If you go in and its full, try coming back another time. 

Remarkable home fries, always. I am disappointed by every home fry i encounter that isnt from the Coffee Pot. I have had their omelette and egg meals, burger meals, their soups and different daily specials, I honestly cant say a bad thing about any thing.
Theyll make you anything the way you want it once youve become a regular. i mean, ive been happily dining there from 3 days a week to once a month and they always make me feel at ease and welcome.

Lots of breakfast places ive eaten at in Lakewood have been over priced, or cheap with cheap taste. The Coffee Pot seriously delivers amazing taste, quality service and unbeatable prices."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had the pancakes which were very tasty and filling. Service was very good and it was nice to see a family restaurant that clearly had family working there."}
{"text":"Small quiet street parking available. The food was carefully done they do take their time. Be ready for a short wait. If you're in a hurry this isn't the place for you. Like being in your mother's kitchen. Close Quarters happy people a little noisy but all worth it. Food was carefully done. Lots of choices. Love getting the waffle poached eggs bacon and a good cup of coffee. That's what life is made of small memories socializing happy people Good Times."}
{"text":"The Coffee Pot is a nice little \"hole in the wall\" breakfast/lunch location in Lakewood.

Only open until the early afternoon (and closed on Mondays) - but a great place to sit and have a nice quiet breakfast.

The decoration is very much \"Mom's diner\" - from the tea kettle clock to the stools at the bar.  

Breakfast orders are delivered pretty quickly - and the short stack of pancakes is large and fluffy enough that I typically have to take some leftovers home."}
{"text":"The place was packed and we waited a little longer for our food but it was worth the wait. Great coffee& newspaper with my honey sitting at the bar. Thank you. The Italiano omelet was D-lish!! Jo & Tony"}
{"text":"I went to The Coffee Pot this past Saturday around noon with my best friend.  I had heard of this place through a forgotten source and had always wanted to stop in.  The food is delicious, the restaurant is small with 3-4 booths, about 4-5 two tops and space at the bar.  I had what I remember as The Don (dont' quote me on this).  It had two sausages, two bacon, two eggs any style, toast and grits.  It was exactly what I was looking for, delicious, simple breakfast food.  For the two of us it was $17 plus tip.  When we first got there, there were only about 3 other people there but as we ate, it livened up again.  Don't expect anything pretty when you walk in, its older looking and kinda meh but that is not what matters.  The food is so good and completely affordable.  Our server was nice and made sure our water glasses and coffee cups were to the brim without being a complete nuisance or making us feel rushed.  There is only one cook (this cute old lady) and at the time we went there was our server and what looked like her three young kids helping out.  Overall a great experience and I plan on going back and introducing this place to more friends!  **Also, I could have sworn I had heard they were cash only so I made sure to stop at the ATM."}
{"text":"Spinach  veggie omelette with the English muffin with the home fries it was delicious"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning around 10:00am.  We were seated right away, the waitress came over and took our drink order.  Came back in a couple minutes to drop off our coffee and was a little flustered that we were ready to order.  Our food was delicious, but not sure how bad someone can screw up scrambled eggs.  
Service was good. I think we found a new place for weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"Well worth walking to, even in the snow!

We found this place while looking for a local place that didn't require digging our car out from under a foot of snow and it was fantastic. Just as the name implies, great coffee, great fresh prepared food.

Totally the local mom and pop kind of diner where you can expect to be there a while as they prepare your food.

Excellent local find"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have found in Cleveland.  Good friend of mine took me there and I've been sold on it since.

GOOD STUFF:  Best breakfast place in cleveland.  Skip those high maintenance places that want to charge you 10 bucks for an omelette.  This place has real solid breakfast fair with cheap prices.  The omelettes are big and served with buttery toast and lots of hash browns with onion, the coffee is strong, and there's not a huge line out the door.

BAD STUFF:  Not the best place if you looking for a fancy bruch to take your family- it's a diner.  Not very big either so if you have a large group be ready to be cramped.

PRICE:  15 bucks for two for a big, belly too full breakfast

OVERALL:  I've been looking for a place like this for a long time- cheap, solid breakfast food, nice feel to the place, no lines.....check it out."}
{"text":"Looking for a good cheap brunch place, we came across The Coffee Pot.  Conveniently located on our way to shopping on W 117th, we thought we'd give it a try.  We were not disappointed at all.  As the reviews say, it's not the cleanest place, but by far not the dirty disgusting place some made it sound like.  

When we walked in we were greeted with a friendly hello and told to sit wherever we wanted.  Service was quick and friendly (although we went late afternoon on Saturday, so there was only one other customer at that time).  

I ordered the All American (burger and cheese) omelet with home fries and toast.  My boyfriend ordered the Western omelet.  Both were cooked to perfection and tasted great.  The home fries (my favorite) were really good.  Seasoned perfectly with onions and pepper.  And I agree with a few other reviews, probably the best I have had around Cleveland.

Our check was only $17 (including tip) for two meals.  The amount of food you get, you will definitely walk away satisfied and full.

Overall...we were satisfied with the food, the price, the service and the portions and we will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this place fool you! Although it may be a dated looking diner with none of the modern frills, this is a silent storm of deliciousness. I debated on whether or not to write this review because a part of me would like it to remain a well kept secret. I don't want to have to wait in line to get my favorite breakfast!"}
{"text":"Small diner but the food and service was awesome! The food was great! I really wanted there pumpkin pancakes but they only do that on the weekends so beware. I had there banana pecan and it was good as well. There home fries were also super yummy but I think I liked there coffee the best!"}
{"text":"If we had been greeted with a smile, served quickly (like you should be served in a diner), and been provided with a clean environment, The Coffee Pot would have gotten a full 5 stars.

But instead, we walk in and get stared at. Every table is full -- understandable, but no \"Can I help you?\" Instead, blank stares from everyone seated as well as the woman behind the counter. She says it'll be 15 minutes, so we said we'd wait right outside.

Well, it was only 5 minutes until the table right by the window clears out. Great! We go in and expect the usual: water, utensils/napkins, etc. Nope. After the table gets wiped off and we settle in, nobody comes to us for at least 10 minutes.

Finally, we get a drink order in. About five minutes later we are brought our coffees, but no cream or sugar (she took our orders and said she was going to bring it afterwards). But she doesn't, and we think they have forgotten about it. It's so sad to see a cup of STEAMING hot coffee go to waste because you can't put your stuff in it and drink it (and no, drinking it black was not an option). So I take matters into my own hands, grab sugar from an empty table and cream from the counter. But there are still no spoons to stir it with, so I kinda jiggle it back and forth.

And that's where we sit and wait ... and wait for over 30 minutes.

Mind you, it HAD been full when we walked in. But tables are leaving and no more people are coming in. So what gives?

It's while I'm sitting and waiting that we start to notice gross -- unacceptably gross -- things about this place. It is filthy. There is dirt and dust on every surface that is not a table. I don't think the underside of the tables, the chairs, and the floor have been given a good cleaning in ages. I see a wasp lazily crawling on the window ledge next to our table, and because it looks pretty drunk, I'm not too scared that it's going to fly over and sting me. But it is still a disgusting environment to be eating in.

So then what? The food comes. And boy, is it GOOD. So fucking delicious! I am having a total mindfuck. Was I just hungry before and pissed off that our daughter cannot sit in her high chair (which was, also, filthy and had cream of wheat on it from the last baby who sat in it) unless she is occupied? With food, I mean. We had Elmo, books, and her juice, but she had no interest in sitting down in this seat until her pancake was in front of her.  Again, there weren't that many people in the place at this point -- only 3 tables -- so I don't know what takes so long for a couple of scrambled eggs and hash out of can.

HOWEVER: Again. The food tasted like crack, it was so good. And there was a lot of it. And then the women started acting all nice to us.  So was my pre-food attitude just an overly sensitive one? I usually give places the benefit of the doubt, especially greasy spoons/locally owned holes-in-the-wall. But this was less of a greasy spoon and more of a dirty spoon.

So anyway. I don't think I will ever ever go here again because of the cleanliness factor and the fact that we spent an hour and a half in a fucking DINER. That should be against the law because the point of going to a diner is to get good coffee, good hot food served quickly .... and then to get the fuck out of there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go for breakfast, but their lunch is awesome too. My husband and I usually frequent on the weekend. 

Everything they do, they do well. It's a family run business, it's inexpensive and it's delicious. Great breakfast. They have the best home fries around. I've recently become addicted to their tuna melt. I've tried almost everything on their menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I live right down the street from this place and had heard wonderful things about it, but I had to check it out for myself.  Man, did it live up to my expectations!  Awesome omelettes, fantabulous potatoes, great service, good coffee.  I take my out of town guests there all the time and they love it too!  Michelle always remembers me, and that makes it so homey and comfortable.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in CLE/Lakewood. No frills. No fuss. The Coffee Pot is a family run business with reasonably priced, consistently delicious food. There's a few booths (2 or 3) and a couple 2 top tables, two 4 top tables, and a diner counter with 5 or 6 stools (one is always broken). Not much seating, but I've never had to wait for a table/seat. 

Parking is always easy with plenty of street parking nearby. 

Prices are reasonable and the employees have always been friendly to me. I love reading the newspaper (minus getting the newsprint on my hands) and drinking a cup of coffee while waiting for my breakfast to arrive. 

It's not fancy, but it's good."}
{"text":"Decent food slow service. My boyfriend wanted traditional breakfast but didn't want to travel to far from home. We found ourselves at the Coffeepot and in no particular hurry. 

This small establishment was full so we were asked to wait outside for an available table. It was a nice day so I didn't mind until was about 20 minutes past the expected wait time we started to get antsy.  Not to long after we were seated but then waited another 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by our waitress. These long gaps between service continued through our entire meal. 

While their potatoes were quite delicious and the meal a satisfying plate of breakfast the service was enough to keep us from visiting again."}
{"text":"It is after all a neighborhood coffee shop. As long as your expectations aren't of the Ritz, this place is perfect, reasonable, and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to get really inexpensive breakfast; I feel it's sort of an under-rated little spot.  I always get the one of the cheapest breakfast options on the menu, which includes two eggs, home fries, and toast.  The home fries are made from freshly chopped potatoes and have added pepper and onions, which is cooked to perfection.  You won't be receiving pre-packaged hash browns here.  They also have ITALIAN toast, which I love - since other places usually carry only wheat, white, or rye.  Sure, it's a little dirty inside, and I've even went down into the basement to use the restroom one time and felt like I was in Amityville horror - but I made it out and never saw a bug.  I've also never had a bad experience with the food."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE food snob having gone to school for it and moved here from CA. I live in Lakewood and this is one of THE best hole in the walls for breakfast. 
Jozi and Don crank out some extremely tasty food. Many people do not know that Don also works in Tremont in a higher end restaurant in the evening.
The best things here are the steak and eggs with the fresh cooked home fries. Also their potato pancakes and corned beef hash are very good. I cannot say about omelettes or French toast and pancakes as I have not had them.

If you are looking for fancy brunch than you are in the wrong place, but  if you want tasty, reasonably priced food you should get over to this FOX's Hot List FAVE."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot. I had the banana-can pancakes and a side of corned beef hash. Both were incredible. It's a family run place, which carries its own charm, and the coffee is great. My pancakes were huge and thick with actual bananas in them. The corned beef hash was done outstanding; it's so hard to find good hash and this place exceeded expectations. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and looking for a unique place to stop for breakfast, read this place had great reviews so figured we'd give it a try. The food was AMAZING, definitely home made and fresh, best potato pancakes I've had. Food took a little bit of time to come out but well worth the wait. Friendly service. Might not look like much from the outside, but definitely worth stopping for. Next time we are in town we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Typical greasy spoon breakfast diner.  My western omelet and home fries were very tasty, and the service was quick and the staff very friendly!   

I have to give three stars because the blueberry pancakes my daughter ordered were not very good at all.  They were actually pretty tough (probably overcooked) and were difficult to cut for her.  They at least used fresh blueberries but the actual pancake itself had no flavor at all.

Hopefully this is just a one time thing. But being as it is walking distance to my house, its a pretty good spot for a quick Saturday stop.+"}
{"text":"For a place with \"coffee\" in the name I was disappointed by the weak coffee. My eggs were slimy & gross, bacon was chewy and tasted like the precooked stuff, food was exceptionally slow coming out (half hour plus), service was lacking. On the positive side - hot cakes were nice and fluffy & prices were cheap. Honestly I'm surprised this place stays I'm business with the number of breakfast spots in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Typically on any given Sunday, I'm on a mission for a greasy, filling brunch, and football all day later in the day. I know the Coffee Pot has been a staple Diner in the city of Lakewood, but I don't typically make it out here and if I'm around, the group consensus is always the Diner on Clifton. 

Nothing fancy or too cute. I came here for brunch and left satisfied, happy, and full. It's your typical neighborhood family owned diner run by some really nice people. The portions of the food is definitely a winner. It seems like their breakfast menu options come in the right tiers for your level hungry. My order consisted of orange juice, coffee, bacon, sausages, potatoes, eggs, and pancakes. That's all one order, nothing extra added and that's a deal!

If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a good meal, stop by and grab a bite. Definitely recommend the Coffee Pot."}
{"text":"Cheap food, good food, great service, relaxed atmosphere, and did I mention good food? Little hole in the wall that serves AMAZING breakfast."}
{"text":"Okay food for a quick diner breakfast. As far as food quality and service, I would rate it average. It is your typical diner food. The server was nice and checked on us frequently. The atmosphere could use some changes. It gets crowded fast!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, great value and service. Waitress told us their burgers were very good so we  did lunch on Friday and the burgers were great! We'll make this a regular dining spot in the 'wood 'hood!"}
{"text":"Really not happy we went here. Not very busy on a Saturday morning, I think we know why now. We walked in the door and were ignored by the staff, we picked a table and asked if we could sit. The table was dirty and the sever wiped it with a dirty wet rag, leaving it wet for a good 20min. Two of us ordered Jozi's fave which was a typical eggs/pancakes combo and both of our pancakes were undercooked. We ordered the eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese and got them with American cheese which was goopy and very unappetizing.  It took a long time to get our crummy food and everyone just seemed unhappy to help."}
{"text":"The food was so good. This is a small diner with excellent food and service. The only bad I can say is it took a long time for the food to come but it was so delicious. My toast was already buttered it was so good like heaven in my mouth. Definitely will be one of my go to spot."}
{"text":"I find myself coming back to this place often, a gem on Madison. It's an old-school no nonsense breakfast spot. Let me explain...

It's a small neighborhood diner - a narrow space behind the counter so the servers had to maneuver their way around each other whenever there was more than one person at the aisle. I could see through to the kitchen with two people working diligently on the food orders and a child standing and watching in awe. Coffee grounds and toast crumbles speckled the cramped counter-top where the servers prepped food items and beverages.

The food: eggs and home fries usually slightly burnt, and a slightly over-diluted coffee of little else in notable quality. Substitutions are readily available (egg whites, turkey bacon).

The service: responsive and courteous, even at busier times. The servers and cooks work well together as a team, hustling to get orders out while still exchanging small pleasantries with the customers.

All of this works for me as a vision of the small, family-owned diner.

The biggest con for me is that parking may get a little tricky (street parking only), but I've always found a spot around the block that was reasonable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Lakewood. 7 tables and a bar top, and with that, you know this place is special. Great coffee, BEST breakfast potatoes made by the mom in back, and just an overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Even with the many places on the west side to get breakfast, it is hard to find one that consistently cooks eggs and potatoes well--but the coffee pot is just that place. They season (without oversalting) and cook their potatoes perfectly, the eggs are always cooked perfect and never burnt, and the atmosphere and workers are very nice. I have been looking for a regular breakfast place with a great omelette ever since Clifton diner closed, and I would say this place is the one when it comes to a good, well rounded breakfast."}
{"text":"The worst experience... waited 40 minutes after ordering to only find out it would take another 15 minutes before We could get our order... IHOP doesn't take that long and charged me for the water down coffee after waiting so long ! Needless to say we didn't get our food and walked out!!"}
{"text":"Jozi's Fav  deserve's my rave!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch a week ago for the first time and it was good. Standard diner food, my girl got the burger and it was huge! I recommend the feta and spinach omelet, it was very good. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"It's OK. It's just like opening the fridge and cooking it yourself if you're not a chef but can fry and egg. I was mislead by the reviews. It's really about as plain Jane as they come. It's not horrible. You won't die. But you'll ask yourself why I listened to a bunch of hipsters who think birdtown is \"quaint.\" This lead me to label it the PBR of breakfast spots. It's breakfast like your grandfather cooks. No frills, No spice because the doctor said so, It serves its purpose, and if you turn your nose up at it, you feel bad because it's your grandpa (or he kicks the crap out of ya, you goodfornothing ingrate!)"}
{"text":"Quaint and cute little place. Friendly owners who make it feel like home. Great omelets and coffee!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have no problem trying a place close to home twice if the first tgime wasnt great, and I will tell you what everytime I went back it continued to get worse! I make a better breakfast throwing crap together in my kitchen hung over. The food is terrible the wait sucks even when its not busy and my order is never right!!! having worked in the restaurant industry for many many years, acuaracy is a big thing for me and when you screw up a simple egg, toast and homefry order up, you have problems. I have found hair in my food twice and i refuse to go back ever again. This place is gross, they take no pride in how they complete your orders and if your not a regular who is blind with no tastebuds, they could care less about providing good service. i wish there were negative stars on this review because they would get it!"}
{"text":"Typical greasy spoon ... Can't really complain about the food, and it's pretty cheap, but I definitely wouldn't recommend going there on the weekends.  Or if you're claustrophobic. Or if you're looking for quality ingredients."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Lakewood! The coffee is always good and you can't go wrong with those banana can pancakes! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love mom and pop breakfast spots, this one in my first experience was sub par. I ordered the corn beef omelette, I think it was called the paddy, it came with home fries that tasted like they had been sitting on a dirty flat top all morning, and the omlette tasted funny, I think it was the corn beef.  my usual spot is \"the shore\" on Detroit and Hopkins, but I came back to the coffee pot to see if it was any better and it wasn't. I usually don't give generally bad reviews (hence the 3 stars), but I was really hungry, and the fact that I got up in 25 degree weather and drove there, only to bring it back home and be disappointed sucked. I will probably give it another chance as I see many good reviews."}
{"text":"I go here a few times a month, and never regret it.  That being said make no mistake about it, this is a greasy spoon diner and they are a dime a dozen in Cleveland.  Nothing fancy here.  But the food is just incredible.  I have never had something bad, or even just decent, I always have a great meal.  

My personal favorites are the bagel bite (bagel w/ fried egg, cheddar, choice of meat), Greek omelette, and their toast.  I don't know how they make toast so delicious, but they do.  It's just the usual Giant Eagle bread, so I don't know if they have some sort of magical toaster or butter...but it's phenomenal.

Great food, good prices, and relaxed environment - all the things I like for a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"AWFUL.  Really.  Phenomenally bad.

An hour and a half for scrambled eggs and pancakes?!?!  And then these eagerly anticipated plates are inedible?  Please.

The icing on the cake was the fact that my pancakes were finally brought out 15 minutes after our plates were cleared away.  When I said I couldn't wait any longer - that I didn't want the pancakes, nor did I want to pay for them - the manager/owner was nasty about it and yelled at my husband that she was now forced to throw food in the garbage.

I love Cleveland and I love a local joint, but the food and service here are a complete joke."}
{"text":"I am relatively new to the Lakewood area, but I have been to The Coffee Pot enough times to know that it is one of our Sunday morning favorites when we are in town.  Yes, it is a small establishment and it doesn't look like the cleanest place in the world, but I haven't encountered a sticky or gross table yet, nor has the quality of the food we have eaten ever been questioned.  

The Hangover Special is a favorite, as are the omelette selections.  Our coffee cups are never empty and when the two ladies working start to recognize you as regulars, they really do make you feel very welcome.  We will happily continue to eat at this cozy Lakewood breakfast dive."}
{"text":"The waiters and waitresses were seriously incredible and so attentive.  Five stars to the staff.  But the food just wasn't that great.  The pancakes were unimpressive.  The eggs lacked something.... weird.  I loved the small, cozy diner feel though;  I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place randomly after finding it on Yelp. It had a pretty good rating so I figured why not. I'm so happy I went! This place is a little family run breakfast place with no frills but the food is amazing and the people are really nice. Not to mention it's dirt cheap. If you want a good home cooked breakfast, go to Coffee Pot!"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday at 9:45 am.  No wait, sat at the counter.  Prompt polite service.  This place is not \"dirty.\"  It's no dirtier than my grandma's kitchen was over on Olivewood and I ate her food and didn't die.  So let that go.  My H and I each got the Jozi's Fav.  I got French toast, he got the massive pancakes.  Excellent, perfectly cooked.  Over easy eggs also perfectly good.  Good coffee.  We didn't feel rushed.  Total bill was $19 and I tipped 25%.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"First time customer. Came when they were working in the street. I  Had the Producer omelette. Great food, friendly staff. and Hometown neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, by far the BEST home fries Ive ever had! Nice employees as well :)"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and was in Cleveland for business. I was looking for a home-cooked breakfast with good service and friendly ambiance that had nothing to do with starbucks, and that's what I found in The Coffee Pot. This place has a warm fuzzy feeling like you're eating in grandma's kitchen and the fresh sausage & bacon were cooked to perfection. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Used to come all the time and it was great. Went again About 6-7 months ago and the wait was about an hour. Food came out Burned. Ppl who came after us got their meals before us and I was very annoyed. The waitress came to the table and said \"you look mad, are u mad it took so long\".  In an u apologetic way. I said I'm fine. She said 2 more times that I looked mad, very rude. SO on to today. Went again thinking it was a fluke visit. No. Got there at noon. Got MY food at 1:50pm. The person I was with didn't get her food for another 15 mins after me. Cheese wasn't melted and the potato pancakes were undercooked like raw rubber slabs. Cooks walking around listening to music like it wasn't busy. The owner manager whoever... Same lady that was asking if I was mad was out of the kitchen just talking to a friend for like 30 mins. No apologies for the wait time. No one came back to ask how our food was. We had to wave a waitress down to ask for a drink. We were both so mad we just had to go up and pay without waiting another hour for our checks to get the hell out of there. Will never go back ever. Terrible service. Mediocre food u can make at home."}
{"text":"I've had some great meals at The Coffee Pot, but there are a few things that miss the mark that make me wonder why some things can be so good and others so mediocre.

The sausages. Why do they serve these things. I've had better sausages from a free hotel breakfast. There's no skin and it's very greasy and mushy. Like the kind you fondly remember from elementary school cafeteria breakfast. These are the worst part about The Don where you get a little bit of everything - everything else is on point (excellent bacon). I honestly would have rather paid the same price and had them exclude the sausage.

I've never had really good coffee from here. The last two times I've been there it barely tastes like coffee - just hot water. You gotta have that strong diner coffee, especially if you're going to be called \"The Coffee Pot\". This is not a difficult one to solve - they're just not using enough coffee beans for the water. Most gas station coffee I've gotten is stronger.

The Banana pancakes are AWESOME as are the home-fries. The omelettes are made very well. They have a lot going for them.

Overall, they're at 3.5 stars right now in my book. Stronger coffee would bump it up to 4 stars and better quality sausage would make it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The service took forever. The food was mediocre. The eggs were way overcooked.
Perhaps I'm biased because I was expecting so much more based on the good reviews."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. Cozy little restaurant with good food. I will definitely  be going back soon"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The food was awesome.   You definitely have to get the home Fries. The serving sizes are large.   The food is seasoned to perfection.  This is a family run business that makes meals that are comfort food.  Which you will leave you in a good mood.  Every review talks about the slow services   I agree it is not a fast food atmosphere.  So if you looking quick service go to McDonald's.  If you are looking for a great meal come hear. Be patient.  It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and lunch fare. Everything made to order. The BEST home fries around!! Incredibly friendly people, always welcoming and kind. Amazing prices for made from scratch food. It is busy and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Never Judge a Book by its cover...

As you walk in this small, 7 table and a counter Diner, you may not have the best ambiance, but the food is OUT of this World! They have numerous breakfast favorites, as well as lunch and the prices are extremely reasonable. I ordered the Banana Pancakes with bacon which was phenomenal... you definitely cant go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"This place is not a place to go if you are visiting Cleveland.  It's not trendy.  It doesn't really feel that clean.  But it is awesome.  I love the Coffee Pot.  I love the homefries.  I love the bacon.  I love coming here to study or knowing that I'm not going to see anyone.  It's my favorite place to eat by myself.  Yah it's not even close to a five star spot but who cares.  It's small, comfortable and gets the job done."}
{"text":"I came late on a Tuesday morning. Well ok it was 1145 so almost lunch and got breakfast. It was slow and it's the perfect quaint kind of breakfast place. 

The server was attentive and knew a few regulars. 

I had the Italiano omelet and it was very good. I like how they didn't kill you with mozzarella cheese but was enough To satisfy you. 

I wish I had a place like this close to my apt back in Boston so I didn't have to drive for a decent breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ok - this is where we ended up after trying a couple other places. 

First, we had to wait quite a long time for coffee to come to the table, which is a HUGE strike against them. 

Our waitress was cranky, and not kind at all. Didn't do coffee refills - another strike. WE had to ask for more coffee and when it came, the waitress poured it down my husband's hand and never apologized or anything 

Ordered a chocolate chip pancake for my granddaughter and it wasn't cooked inside so we sent it back and the second one was raw too. 



The breakfast potatoes were amazing -  but that was the only thing 

This is by far a ONE AND DONE"}
{"text":"Wanted to get some good breakfast with a friend today. Was looking for a local diner. Read the reviews of this place which were stellar. I cannot for the life of me figure out why.  Walked in to a very warm cluttered place on a hot Cleveland morning, no AC, no fans. The sign said please wait to be seated. We waited and waited, while 3 different employees made nearly constant eye contact with us but didn't acknowledge us. Just as we were about to leave someone shouted from across the room \"you can just sit wherever you want.\" We sat down and a woman took our drink orders and it was another 5 minutes or so before she came back with my orange juice. I ordered the Banana Can Pancakes. (Bananas and pecans) with a side of sausage links. The pancakes were okay. Nothing special. The sausage tasted like a dirty grill. Seriously, who screws up sausage links? I asked for a water and you guessed it, it tasted terrible. The water.. tasted.. terrible. I hate giving bad reviews to Lakewood restaurants, but there was nothing redeeming about this place. Will had back to The Grey Dog Diner for their yummy biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"There are a few cardinal rules in the restaurant business. At or near the top of the list is \"get the customer's order right.\" Much less rarely seen, but closely related, would have to be \"don't unilaterally change the customer's order and serve him what YOU think is best, rather than what he actually ordered.\"

This is why I'm giving The Coffee Pot 2 stars. 

Before I explain, I will say this: the food I did get was fairly good. The whole wheat toast was actually top notch, the scrambled eggs were good and the home fries with sliced onions were pretty tasty. Essentially what you're expecting from a greasy spoon type diner. That having been said, the presentation was a bit less than ideal. The home fries and the shriveled bacon were both shades of gray--not figuratively--they were literally gray on the plate. Not appetizing to see, despite the fact that they actually tasted fine. 

The coffee was decent, which has to be mentioned given the name of the place. Although as stated in some other reviews, the mug was the thing that was past its expiration date. The glaze on the ceramic was chipped and worn away. I had to switch sides to drink out of it. Again, fairly good product, but poorly presented. 

Now for the big problem. 

I ordered The Don. As listed on the menu this comes with 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, grits or home fries (I'm not 100% sure that's an OR but I think it is--and that matters here) plus hot cakes. 

I told the waitress I didn't want the grits. No problem, right? As far as I could tell it was grits OR home fries anyway. Even if I was mistaken, she left it at that and didn't inquire further, leading me to think I had just picked from a choice of two options, but had otherwise ordered the full breakfast. 

Not so.

When the order arrived it was just the eggs, meat, home fries and toast. I thought maybe the hot cakes would follow. But they never came. After a few minutes, the waitress delivered the check and informed me, in a polite and pleasant tone, that she had not charged me for The Don. She made it seem like she had done me a favor, which I found odd because even though I ordered it, she had not actually served me The Don. Of course she shouldn't charge me for it! 

I asked why, and she told me that it doesn't make sense to order it without the grits and hot cakes. 

I told her I only declined the grits, she just never brought me hot cakes. (That it was her error, not mine, although I said so more politely than that.) 

She just looked miffed. Rather than acknowledging her mistake, or apologizing even, she simply replied \"oh well, you would have been really full if you had the hot cakes.\" 

Which is kind of the point of going out for breakfast, isn't it?

Unfortunately, breaking a rule as basic as this drops the rating way down. On the food alone, this might have been a 3 or 3 1/2 star review. Issues of presentation, old mugs, etc would have kept it out of the 4 star level no matter what. But deciding on your own to simply change my order...that drops the place a full grade lower. 

Some basic things have to be done right. Service matters. Despite decent food, the Coffee Pot failed to meet even this low standard."}
{"text":"The last time I went there it was a breakfast stop before dropping someone off at the Greyhound terminal downtown. When we walked in they seem upset that they had a customer. How dare we walk so early on a Sunday morning. Mind you they were opened for a while now. I'm not one to disparage a business but please puts some effort towards customer service. Don't show disdain when one walks in, it is just plain rude. I've left some time distance between the event posting this update on purpose. I've not been back since."}
{"text":"Without question and by a wide margin, this is the worst diner in Lakewood. Eggs are burnt black on the bottom and runny on top. Fries are so salty that they are inedible. Burgers are made with meat so cheap that they are difficult to chew."}
{"text":"The coffee pot is a quintessential Lakewood Breakfast dive. it embodies the small-town Lakewood charm, the run down bird-town location, and the quirky and hilarious staff that runs the place.

We had never stopped in here before, but after going to my friends and around the corner so many times, why not give other places a try!

Boy, I'm at a loss for words about how epic the food is here. I got \"the don\" breakfast and was not prepared for the huge portions of epic deliciousness that got plated in front of me. At $8 it satiated breakfast and lunch for me.

The wait for food was a bit long, but it truly is a home cooked meal. The food quality is way above other Lakewood breakfast spoons.

I can definitely see why this place has won a few awards, and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Value and great cakes.  What else do you need from a breakfast diner.  Fast they are not, but again, they are short ordering your requests a few at a time.  Friendly and attentive with the coffee refills. Potatoes were good, with skins on them traditional style. Also had the Banana Can pancakes and they were serious and heavy, the way they should be.   I will return to this location soon."}
{"text":"This little place is awesome.  The atmosphere is family  oriented. Cute quaint and the food is inexpensive and great. Edwina was a great server.  Thanks Edwina and staff foe being so kind."}
{"text":"This place is very dirty, dingy, sad, depressing.  The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the food was ok. It took 35 mins for an order of pancakes and 2 eggs over easy. really? The only time the server came to check on us was when we were done.  Im never going back"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in dire need of breakfast this weekend and stumbled upon The Coffee Pot thanks to Yelp (reviews) and Foursquare (proximity).  If you're looking for a greasy spoon, this is the real deal: old booths, signs that could be from last week or a decade ago, a handful of lifers who know the regular customers, and prices that reflect all of these facts.  For $13, we had two solid coffees, a Greek omelette with a generous amount of feta, and a platter that included French toast AND scrambled eggs AND bacon.

This is good stuff, you guys.  No frills - just solid diner fare, and maybe you'll even get to work on a crossword that someone's left behind.  I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Can't knock a great diner.  We had just flew in on a red eye from Seattle - and well, we found this place on Yelp.  It did not disappoint.  If you're looking for excellent bacon, great grits and feeling like you're in your Gramma's house - go here!  :D  And they have Frank's on the table - extra points in my book!"}
{"text":"We ended up here after a long-winded search for a (nonexistent) Waffle House in Cleveland. After we got over the initial disappointment of Waffle House being off our radar, we had a very enjoyable breakfast! Their coffee lived up to the restaurant's name and I really enjoyed their blueberry pancakes. 
The one drawback that I found was their bathroom. It's a bit off-putting to cut through their kitchen and basement just to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I wanted to try their Sunday breakfast, and we were suprised at how tiny the place was and how dirty it looked. The kitchen was dark. I think the cashier was doing the cooking as there was only two women working and they weren't very friendly. It took long to get service and the food tasted great. I had the Italian Omelette and Rye with two cups of coffee. She had the BLT. When we got home both of us had to run to the toilet and had the squirts!  I have had the shits for almost a week now, with stomach cramps, headache, cold chills, fever, and loss of appetite.  I don't like having food poisoning! This place would more appropriately be called THE BOTTOM of THE COFFEE POT!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome small diner. Good food at good prices. Kids loved the blueberry pancakes!  Omelet was top notch and the coffee hit the spot.  Very small place so you get fast and personal service."}
{"text":"Very homey place to sit & enjoy the atmosphere. We walk in the door and instantly received a hello & a smile when we walked in the door. Great service & very prompt.  I asked our waitress what was good & she didn't hesitate to say everything.  She proceed to tell me her favorites. I got 2 of her suggestions the sombero & banana can pancakes both were just fantastic!  Their homefries are tasty... actual potatoes with onions and seasoning.  I use ketchup on just about every kind of potatoes but sure didn't need it on these home fries. If you like small cozy & friendly restaurants with great food this will be your new favorite brunch zone."}
{"text":"Everyone was very kind and the food was homemade and delicious. Your typical, hole in the wall diner with an enjoyable atmosphere. The pancakes and French toast were very fluffy and great tasting. The only thing is I wished they had chocolate chips!!"}
{"text":"If you've been to Big Al's Dinner on the east side (they are now closed RIP) and The Place to Be in Lakewood, the place looks like Big Al's and the food is similar to The Place to Be. So you don't come here for the ambiance, it's for the cheap comfort food and very friendly service. You feel at home and it's nice."}
{"text":"Family owned diner... cute and small.. went here to grab a late brunch on a Thursday and it was delicious! There is only one waitress for the whole place, every table but 2 were filled and there is only one cook... had to wait awhile for the food but it was well worth it... food was delicious and hit the spot..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quintessential diner this is it. Just a few tables and staff make it feel cozy not crowded. Everyone was super friendly and an obvious family affair. We had the omelets home fries. The home fries are homemade and super flavorful. The omelets were light and fluffy. Great coffee, great atmosphere. Just what we were hoping for!"}
{"text":"This is a great little greasy spoon that's perfect for a late breakfast after sleeping off a night of heavy drinking. Great made to order eggs, hash browns, grits (GRITS!!), and french toast made me damned happy. If you're in the area it's totally worth showing up for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"You know, I've been coming to the Coffee Pot for 20 years, and i've never reviewed the spot. No idea why, because it's an institution in Lakewood and I wish I could carbon copy it to every place i've ever lived.

Coffee Pot is the golden standard for which all breakfast joints should be held to. It's friendly and local, and the service is always prompt and cheerful. The food is the kind of  delectable and simple, no-nonsense breakfast fare that i've always craved on sleepy weekend mornings. I love the poached eggs and pancakes, and I love the mom and pops feel to the environment.

Given my druthers, i'd come to the Coffee Pot for breakfast every day."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for an omelette and bacon.  The cook came out and said she hadn't forgotten our order, but that they were out of eggs.  Not sure why the waitress didn't tell us that so we could have the option of changing our order.  Then, first bite into the omelette had a huge piece of egg shell.  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea how this is such a low rated establishment. I had such a great experience here yesterday. 
I came here on a recommendation claiming that this place made the best blueberry pancakes -- I was not disappointed. First of the pancakes are huge! They were so dang delicious even for simple blueberry pancakes they were perfect. And the amount of blueberries was outrageous (in a good way) SO. MANY. BLUEBERRIES. I also had some bacon which standard delicious bacon. Also had an order of potato pancakes and they were also very good. I would have liked them to have a little more onion flavor and be a bit crispier but that's just personal preference. Now for the coffee... I absolutely hate diner coffee. I thought their coffee was pretty good. 
Next for the service. This is a family owned and operated business which I love. The owner and her daughter took or orders and served us and were very attentive and friendly and the place was very busy. The owners son was there working as well but I can't remember what he was doing and the owners nephew was cooking. All around great experience. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We had a few good dining experiences in the western suburbs of Cleveland while in town for my cousin's wedding. The first came on our first morning in town. As we were driving across town from one hotel to another, we stumbled into the Coffee Pot restaurant in Lakewood. My wife researched nearby breakfast places while I ran into Target for a quick purchase and the Coffee Pot was her suggestion.

It would be very easy to drive past the Coffee Pot without even noticing it was there. I don't recall any protruding signage, just the simple neon in the front window. We were looking for it and nearly drove right past it. The inside is as simple as the outside with a few booths around the front and right sides, a long bar counter on the left where the server/cashier worked, and some small tables filling the rest of the space. At the back was the kitchen, where one cook worked to prepare all the food.

We were told to sit where we like from the woman behind the counter. I found a high chair beneath the register for our little one, and she was right over to take a drink order. I just had water and my wife tried their run of the mill diner coffee. Though nothing on our visit would be out of this world, it was all so cheap and in plentiful quantities. For breakfast my wife had an omelette which was served with home fries and your choice of toast.  I didn't sample the omelette, but she really seemed to enjoy it. The home fries were really good served with sautéed onion in the mix.

I ordered a short stack of blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon. When my order arrived I was sure glad I went with the short stack of two pancakes. These were the largest and thickest pancakes I had ever seen. Even with my wife's assistance, I could only eat one and a half. The bacon was crisp, just the way I like it to be.

Our entire meal cost us $16.39 including tip. The Coffee Pot is a great place for a cheap and filling breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such a high rating. Yelp failed on this one.

The good:

It's super cheap.

The bad:
* It's dirty. Tables, floor, everything. My coffee cup was eroding on the edges, exposing the porous ceramic underneath, which was then stained with perfect lip marks. Wonder what the kitchen is like? Yum! 

* The breakfast sausage links are terrible. 

* The oil they cooked everything in, from the potatoes to the presumably Grade D deep fried caseless sausage links, was rancid. This happens when oil is reused, dirty or repeatedly heated and cooled. Nasty.

This goes in to the SYP! category. What's SYP! stand for? The last two words are Yo' Pants! Figure it out."}
{"text":"Plus one and I went to The Coffee Pot on Saturday around 1pm. We were able to seat right down, the place was about half full. The food was delicious! I had Mad Greek omelet (spinach and feta cheese omelet with a side of home potatoes and toast) and Plus One had The Don (2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon, grits, and two pancakes). Everything tasted (and looked) like it was made from scratch. The service was a little less than desirable, we had to ask for menus and none of the three employees we had contact with smiled but they were friendly. The Coffee Pot is a really good brunch place, I will be going back."}
{"text":"This is my place for breakfast! For sure nice staff good food! Loving this little coffee pot. Gem I use to come when I was younger it's def better now that I'm older price is good."}
{"text":"It is what it is, and what it is is great.  As a connoisseur of greasy-spoon diners, it usually takes a lot for a hole-in-the-wall breakfast joint to impress me.  This place hit the proverbial grand slam on its first trip to the plate.

From the street it doesn't look like much, and the view doesn't get much better when you enter the door.  It's warm inside, and the decorations are kitschy.  Seeing as it's called \"The Coffee Pot\" you would assume that hot cups of various coffee concoctions would be a feature... but you would be assuming wrong.  The coffee, while not a feature, is simple, and strong.  What wins on this menu is the breakfast fare.

The menu highlights include eggs in all manners of preparations, french toast, grits, omlettes, bacon, pancakes, toast, home fries, and sausage.  The omlettes are super fluffy like the eggs have been whipped with soft white clouds from a summer's day, and are accompanied by home fries (crispy with extra onion, yum!) and toast.  Do not miss the toast!  I have to echo Steph and say that this toast is uncanny good!  The pancakes are cakey, not flat and tasteless like you get at most places.

All-day-breakfast is a reason to go here any time you have a craving for breakfast food.  I know I just got home, but I'm thinking up excuses for why I need to go back."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Coffee is endless. The food is simple, I got the Don, but I think they forgot the sausage when I said no grits. Or I'm not remembering the menu correctly. Not too upset about it. Had to remind them for syrup, got asked how the food was literally two seconds after the food was set down, just a generally lacking service. They were busy, but since that only includes about 8 tables, I'm not sure how the three servers could fall behind. 

Eggs are going to come out unseasoned, but the home fries are seasoned and cooked with onions to the perfect taste. I actually loved these potatoes, as most places tend to just leave you with buttery and flat slices of potato. Pancakes are nothing special. Bacon was delicious. 

I live close, so I'll be headed back here after a night out drinking. It's not somewhere I would take someone out on a date, but it'll definitely cure the hankering for some hangover cure."}
{"text":"One of the best homemade breakfasts I've ever had.  Everything is cooked to order and fresh.  I had a simple 2 eggs and sausage breakfast with home fries and toast.  The home fries had a wonderful seasoning and were browned to perfection.  I also splurged and got the banana\"can\" pancakes and they were out of this world!  To top it off, the family who runs it is so genuinely sweet and friendly.  I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The banana-can (banana pecan) hot cakes are simply amazing. They're thick and perfectly done. I highly recommend them!

Paddy's omelet (corned beef and swiss) is equally delicious if you're not in the mood for something sweet. The home fries are some of the best I've had.

The coffee was hot and strong - exactly what I needed.

The owner was doing it all the morning I was there - waitress, cook, and cleanup. My coffee cup was never empty, although I tried.

Not the prettiest decor, but I came here to eat good food, not to look around."}
{"text":"This local spot really surprised me. I had a very good  breakfast of seasoned  potatoes and cornbeef hash.   Just a little  jem of a restaurant with the best breakfast.  I will be back ."}
{"text":"Great little diner! Prices are good too. My omlet had generous toppings. The home fries are sliced potatoes with the perfect amount of pepper. Give this place a try if you like good home cooked food!"}
{"text":"That place had her boyfriend working there as a cook and it doesn't look like to me he had a bath and 20 years if I'm going to eat in a place I want you to look clean"}
{"text":"Low priced. Quaint. Superbly kind. In the words of my wife: \"This is NOT the worst coffee I've ever had.\""}
{"text":"I saw all the enthusiastic yelp reviews about this place and thought that it would be right up my alley... It ended up being just okay...

The banana-can pancakes were heaven, of course, and our waitress was perfectly friendly.

However, the long wait to receive our meals (approx 30 minutes) means we probably would go for a sure thing at Georges, where we've been spoiled by super fast service, not to mention awesome prices and probably equally awesome breakfast...."}
{"text":"Had a sour experience with long wait time for whatever reasons the last time I was there. I was hungover and looking for food and the delay didn't leave me pleased. I quit and went to Einstein Brothers Bagel instead."}
{"text":"Not very good.  Pancakes were under cooked and it took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Greasy great food.  Home fries with grilled onions, pancakes that taste like cake batter and friendly staff and owner.  Coffee pots decorate the inside in kitschy form and you can always find a parking spot in this Birdtown establishment."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I found this place a few months ago and started going regularly since it was close to our house. Our server was super rude every time we went in there. The owner of the place yelled at her a few times for being so rude to us and apologized to us over again. We had came in there around 1245 1 o'clock and the lady server told us they close at two and if we were to come in we need to come in earlier. I told her no problem we could leave and that's when she got in trouble. So we decided to come back and the lady always gave us a hard time I have never felt so uncomfortably at a restaurant. There would be open tables and she would still have us waiting. My only advice to an establishment you should never Hagar your customers leave feeling unwanted. The worst customer service in Cleveland by far. I will never go back or recommend someone going. If your looking for a pleasant place to go this is not the spot."}
{"text":"Coffee Pot is a great family owned restaurant that serves up a cheap breakfast. My Mom informed me today that Coffee Pot was on the news for some kind of investigative report on cleanliness. This does not matter. There are people who eat out of dumpsters. Like Public Enemy says \"Don't Believe the Hype\"."}
{"text":"Love these kind of places.  We went out of the way to find it.  It is small town diner feel in city.   It is good breakfast for good price.   If you read my other reviews I love supporting small local business and this place is for sure small and family owned.   Be prepared to relax because service is at low gear which is not a knock."}
{"text":"\"Loved it! Small but cozy and the food was great. We got the Don (eggs, sausage, bacon, grits, home fries and pancakes). We upgraded to banana pancakes and were not disappointed. The food was all fresh, well cooked, hot absurd delicious. We will be back!\""}
{"text":"I really dig this place, its small and has a real Lakewood feel to it. Food is well prepared, staff is polite and inviting. Cant believe ive never been here all these years. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Tried the Eggcetera and it was amazing! The home fries were some of the best I've ever had! Bacon was crispy but also a little chewy! Small cozy little place but the food is great would definitely come again!"}
