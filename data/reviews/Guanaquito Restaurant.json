{"text":"Loved the food had the Plato tipico, gives you a little of everything. To drink I had an ensalada it's a must try yummy. Definitely recommend. Very busy had to wait a while to be waited on. Other then that it's was great."}
{"text":"Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here yesterday for lunch. I ordered the sample plate, which has traditional Salvadoran food: pupusas, Tamales and yuca. I asked if I could substitute Maduros for the yuca. The waitress didn't speak a lot of English and I don't speak Spanish, so her answer to me was a bit confusing. But when our food arrived, my sample plate had both yuca and Maduros on it, so I was a happy camper. My friend also had the sample plate. I expected the bill to be $25 at the very most, but when we had finished our meal, the bill was $37 ! Since I had water for my drink I was shocked at the high total of the bill! Turns out that the yuca alone was $6 for each plate, and the Maduros were $3/plate. It's not a lunch I would care to repeat..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for 5 years. Food reminds me of home, of grandma, the stew beef was on point (when I used to eat it, not a lot of meat dishes I get down with these days.) Pupusas are legit, get the ones with beans/chicharron. The fruit waters and shakes are awesome, mango shakes remind me of ones I've had in Dominican Republic.  The authentic platter with fried yuca, tamale, pupusas and turnover is the way to go if you want to try something legit right away.  All my latino friends love it. I dream of you pupusaaaassss...."}
{"text":"This was my first venture into Salvadoran cuisine, and what a great place to be exposed to it. This place is so authentic, they barely speak any English. Luckily, I was able to use my decent (although far from fluent) Spanish to ask what things were and get the waitress's recommendations. We had the plato tradicional appetizer, a platter of Salvadoran specialties - for $9, you get two pupusas (of your choice), two beef empenada-like things, three fried yucca things, and a chicken tamale. If you want a nice exposure to different Salvadoran dishes, I highly recommend this as a meal for one or a starter for two or three. The pupusas, especially, were fantastic. Next, we had some chicken dish with onions in a gravy-like sauce--also delicious--that came with a side of rice and beans (and a \"salad\" that was just some iceberg and tomato with a wedge of lime). The refried beans were some of the best I've had. And this whole dish cost $9, if I remember correctly. I highly recommend Guanaquito to expose yourself to the authentic cuisine of El Salvador. The price is right, the service is friendly, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas. I got  a massive plate of those crispy, delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata, which could have been a meal in itself. Our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide. We left stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food great staff crappy area. Popusas were great, empanadas were delicious, yucca was the bomb (first time I eaten yucca) and the tamal wrapped in banana leaf was an unexpected surprise. From El Paso Texas with love...I'll definetly come back the next time I'm in Phoenix...salsa roja estaba deliciosa...."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Clean, hearty and good Salvadoran food. The photo is a traditional Chicken Sandwich. It was so tasteful, with the special mole sauce and chunks of white meat. The pupusas (not pictures) are not greasy, yet made with care, crispy on the edges and full of flair in the middle! This is"}
{"text":"Comida tipica muy bien elaborada. Una atencion muy amable y familiar. Sientete como en tu casa. Buen precio. Muy barato y suficiente cantidad."}
{"text":"Admittedly my first visit to an El Salvadoran restaurant, so keep that in mind. That said the papusas were amazing. I had what I would call a sampler plate. The meat pies which were like tiny empañadas were ok, nothing spectacular. The chicken tamale was pretty good, I wouldn't go out of my way for a second one. There were some deep fried plantains (I think) that were very tasty, proof that everything tastes good when deep fried. The papusas were the star of the show for sure. I was stuffed by the time I finished my plate, but I was still tempted to eat the leftover papusa on my girlfriend's plate. Next time I go I'll just order 3 papusas for sure.  Don't be discouraged by the location, entrance is in the back and your tastebuds will be rewarded."}
{"text":"When I arrived looking on the outside I thought OMG but when I came in the place was full of people all Spanish speaking. The service was good and friendly the food was good and the prices were reasonable. That was a good surprise. I will come again"}
{"text":"I have never eaten El Salvadorean food before!  I was looking for something different and saw the reviews!  I called a friend from El Salvador and he suggested the Pupusas with cheese!  THEY WERE YUMMY!!!  Its my new favorite food!!!  I will be back!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We liked this place. The pupusas were great. Service was also good. We've recommended to family and friends."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I had some sort of delicious fried pancake stuffed with shredded meat & cheese. They were called Pupusas. I cant wait to go back  :P I'm seriously jonesing for some more of those meat pancakes.... I need more like now!"}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I came here I was very skeptical, I mean just at first glance because the entrance is in the back of an alley so it doesn't give off warm and fuzzy. It's a very humble mom and pop kind of place but man are the Papusas on point. My husband is Salvadorian and we have searched the Tucson/Phoenix area for quality Pupusas and by far this is the best place there is. We have brought several friends here who don't know what Salvadorian food is and the've loved it every-time, the servers are very sweet and attentive so feel free to ask questions."}
{"text":"Drove right past the parking entrance my first time past. Actually, many firsts tied to this visit to Guanaquito; first mid-week lunch date, first time having Salvadorian food, first ensalda and my first pupusa. Our drink order was taken and I tried the ensalada this was a sweet and refreshing citrus drink with small pieces of pineapple and papaya this was a perfect drink on a hot day. For an appetizer we tried the pupusa which are fabulous handmade tortillas that are stuffed with a variety of fillings, sampled the pork, cheese and bean - outstanding. For my entrée I had the Chile relleno. Hands down the best relleno I have ever tried. This version was stuffed with carrots, potato, pork and cheese simply scrumptious.   Over-ordered for lunch and I'm enjoying the leftovers as I type this review - just as good reheated."}
{"text":"Pupusas are the perfect combination of cheap and delicious. 10/10, would go again.  (Friendly note here: it's spelled pUpusas, not pApusas.)"}
{"text":"Coming back to AZ, we offered to take a bunch of friends for lunch. Guanaquito never disappoints! Great food, kind staff and the best authentic food in AZ!"}
{"text":"Really, really, really, ridiculously good pupusas.  Those of you who have never tried one before, for the love of all that is holy man try one!   Tip- rough neighborhood, may want to strap on a bulletproof vest before coming down.  Tip- entrance is in the back"}
{"text":"What can I say about Guanaquito that has not already been said? This place is fantastic! I have had two opportunities to try their Pupusa plate and it's just fantastic. The pupusas are cooked to a perfect crisp on the outside. The inside is warm with meat and cheese. Even the rice and beans are great. I will hold back on giving the 5 stars because I want to try other dishes besides the pupusas, but I feel that Guanaquito will earn my 5th star and my loyalty easily!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich in Phoenix. If you visit this place, you have to try the papusas, because that's what they are known for, and they are awesome. But the chicken sandwich (pan con pollo) is one of the best sandwiches I ever had in my life. Shredded, stewed chicken in a mustardy spicy sauce- cucumbers, roma tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro. It's best to order this at lunch time, while the bread is still fresh from the bakery. Really, really great place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the environment. The best Pupusas I have had since I left L.A.. great job I do recommend this place to eat. Don't forget the horchat. Yummy."}
{"text":"Always looking for a hole in the wall with fantastic food and this place is that in spades.  Decor and neighborhood is more on the old commercial district side but you put this food in a nicer area and your at five stars"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! The atmosphere is very unpretentious and the food is so on point. It's really great! I had the Pupuseria meal with beans and rice. Hands down the best Pupusas I've tasted Pupusas in Central America, New York and now Arizona! This place is so worth a try, there are tons of Salvadoreans that eat here, so you know the food is authentic. The mixed fruit drink is also delicious. I had it with bits of fruit mixed in. This is a must visit!"}
{"text":"We can't get this in Tucson and we don't make it at home. When we're in Phoenix, we usually stop here at least once. We enjoy the Pupusas and the yucca frita. We usually take some home with us."}
{"text":"Guanaquito's was a place my GF found out about through someone at work, and she dragged me along. I was skeptical, but optimistic. I have lived in Panama and Guatemala, and I was looking forward to some basic C.A. farmer food.  I was not disappointed. My stewed chicken was excellent. We ordered an appetizer platter: starch as far as the eye could see. They even had yucitas (casava fries). In Panama, we joked  about yuca being the potato's drier, stringier cousin. But Guanaquito's yucitas brought back fond memories of the campo and drunken evenings sitting in Pio Pio in David. A mixed message for most, I'm sure, but for me it was all good.  The staff was awesome, explaining for us gringos how to enjoy the fare. And we did enjoy. I'm looking forward to making my way back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Always a good place for pupusas and other antojitos salvadoreños.  Miss the boat today with their chillaré y nuegados como también el átol de elote .. Next time maybe .. One of our favorite places to eat and take out ..provecho !!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to flat out say this before I start writing the review, my aunt makes the best pupusas.  Now with that being said this is a nice little hole in the wall.  The place is nice and clean.  The food is cheap and delicious.  The people are really friendly and the old man behind the register always seems to great me with a smile ( I think he is the owner).  Mind you pupusas are more filling then they look so don't over order.  I like the traditional queso con loroco.  The plantains are also delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and service at outstanding prices.  I discovered this gem when a friend wanted to try this cuisine. Neither of us had tried it before and so we just searched till we found somewhere with decent reviews. Their pupusas had been talked to death so we both got their pupusa plate.  It comes with 3 (we got the variety of all 3 fillings), rice and beans.  The whole meal is so good.  The pupusas are unlike anything I've had before. The flavours are simple but so perfect that together it's outstanding.  We've been going every month or so since we first tried it about a year ago and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! I got the pupusa plate and my friend had the sampler which came with 2 pupusas, a tamale, yucca frita, plátano and some other thing I can't recall. It was super well priced, delicious, and our food came out very fast. The rice is very flavorful, I think they make it with a lot of chicken broth or bouillon. The location is mildly sketch and you come in through a door in the back but what really matters is that the food is good."}
{"text":"I went there Friday night to try it out on the recommendation of so many Yelpers.  The place was neat and clean and the wait staff most friendly.  We immediately received chips with salsa and curtido( a type of coleslaw.) Didn't really like the curtido, lacked vinegar and some herbs.  But the chips were amazing.: warm, crispy and not greasy.  Nice start. I order the pork chop with plantain, rice mixed with frijoles and salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful, but being a really good cook of latin food I am going to make this recommendation to the cook.  Never add tomato sauce to rice because it makes the absorption of water difficult and makes the rice sticky.  Use Goya's Sason for coloring or tumeric.  That said, my significant other ordered the baked fish dish (because HE is watching is girlish figure) with plantains and salad.  He really enjoyed it.  I ordered a pupusa because I had never, ever, ever had one.  I ordered the one with pork cracklings, beans and cheese.  It was good.  By the way, both entrees can with a side order of pupusa.   Too full to try dessert but they had some interestingly delicious offering.  I think the meal was worth the money.  Try it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the pupusas after reading the reviews, but all the hype didn't reflect my experience.....located in a bright blue building, it was very unassuming....we entered through the back into a dimly lit, but very clean dining area.  The menu sounded good and had photos of everything to make it easy to choose.  my daughter and We ordered the Plato Tipico to get an idea of what they had to offer.   The tamale smelled and tasted of funky fish (I think it was actually pork and potato) with under cooked masa, there were beef empanadas, deep fried hard things that I think were potato and the bean and cheese pupusas...everything tasted of the oil it was cooked in and was very bland.  The cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor.  I also had the horchata which was very good.  We tried ordering a dessert, however after taking our order, the server came back several minutes later to tell us they were out so we ordered something else only to be told later they were out of that too.  Finally we ordered the pork, bean and cheese pupusas to give one more try...it was very cheesey but bland with an odd meat taste.  Overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"What is popusas?! This is what I think they are, it's like a CD sized pancake, filled with something (bean, cheese, or pork), made with corn not flour. The people with me got a platter with three popusas and rice, each. I got a carne plate with shrimp. As an appetizer we got a mix plate with two popusas, yucca fritas, and some very similar to an empanada. Those empanada things were full of flavor, very tasty. I would go back just for those empanada things.   The carne plate was good. Nothing super special, but it had good flavor. The other people also got large glasses of horchata. They loved it and commented how fresh it tasted.   As everyone has said, the area looks very run down; but I assume that is how they can keep prices low. Its painted blue and you have to park in the back. The entance is back there so you don't have to walk around the building.   The reason it is only getting 4 stars is that only one person is serving the entire restraunt, so you have to be patient. That said the staff is very friendly and welcoming.   For my first experience with Salvadoran food, it was good. So if you want some cheap eats and some kind of crazy filled mini pancakes. This is the place for you."}
{"text":"I love getting my Pupusas here! Been coming here since I was little. I always get the three Pupusas combo mixtas. To drink I order the ensalada which is so yummy."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for Salvadoran food because of their consistency. Glad to see they relocated to a bigger location right on the corner because parking and entrance at the previous location was very confusing!"}
{"text":"Argh! I just realized I never reviewed this place, and it's been a while since I've been there. So I shall have to rely on the lasting impressions.  I had the plato tipico, which I think translates as, \"giant plate heaped with fried deliciousness.\"  In fact, the pictures posted here are actual photo documentation of what I had, while dining with Brian G.  The yucca fries were utterly divine -- crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, slightly sweet throughout. The pupusas, pure awesomness (and I've had my share, believe it or not). The empanadas, pretty tasty, but not mind-blowing. The tamale, I could have lived with out.  Thank god it's not closer, of I'd eat there every day, and undo all my hard work at the gym."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so delish and authentic tasting. The food is so fresh and you can tell they take their time making it. I usually order the pupusas when I go, but I have had some of their other dishes as well and everything I've ordered has been good. One of my other favorite dishes is the grilled shrimp. It's got tons of flavor. I highly recommend Guanaquito."}
{"text":"Very easy to miss if your not paying attention! The outside looks very sketchy and also deserted but it's definitely there! There is more then enough parking in the back so no need to worry.  Stopped in for dinner tonight and the place was rather empty. The waitress was very friendly and put in our food orders right away. We had an order of two pupusas which were filled with pork and cheese, a pupusa plate, (three pupusas, rice, and beans) and a bowl of the chicken soup. We waited about 20mins and the food came out piping hott. The pupusas were very flavorful and the red salsa and cabbage to go with them was very tasty. The chicken soup was delicious, and the rice, cucumber salad, and tortillas it came with was the cherry on top! We also had order of the fried plantains with beans and sour cream but unfortunately the plantains had no flavor at all.. the tamarind drink though was the best I've had!   The exterior of this place is not at all pretty. The table we sat at was wobbly and a lot of the booths looked run down and just old. The place has a dirty feel and look to it but hey the food was good.. Lol. Prices are cheap. We spent about $35."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to find a good Salvadorean place in Phoenix and this place is it!  We went there on a whim for dinner, along with three friends and everyone hands down loved the place.  Its clean, comfortable and charming;  the menu is varied, with foods from El Salvador, Mexico, the Caribbean and even a few american style items.  The service is friendly, helpful, and didn't try to hurry us up.   My husband had the steak and onions, and it was excellent. We all shared several pupusas, which everyone loved.  And shared a fried plantain with beans and cream and it was delicious!  My vegitarian friend had the Fried Yuca (w/out the pork), and she loved it.   My husband is puerto rican and is very picky about restaurants, and had been resistant to trying Salvadorean food for a while - but this is now one of his favorite new hole-in the walls in Phoenix. We will be going back often!"}
{"text":"I'm a Central American who moved from Indianapolis recently and was in dyer need to find Central American food nearby. Luckily, the Guanaquito Restaurant is super close to my house and just plain amazing! ((mouth instantly waters thinking about the pupusas and plátano frito ))The ladies there are always nice and the inside has plenty of room for small or big parties. Lunch time gets a little full so keep that in mind.   Definitely need to try this place!"}
{"text":"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, \"What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?\" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago.   Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better."}
{"text":"The chuleta de cerdo I had for lunch here was so delicious - one of the tastiest pork dishes I've ever had. It came with casamiento (beans mixed into rice), a simple salad, fried plantain, and two pupusas. I washed all these down with a cold horchata which had a stronger, more assertive flavor than the horchatas I've had in Mexican restaurants.  It was Easter Sunday when I had this lunch and though this combination was everyday fare, I thought that it was a meal tasty and spectacular enough for the holiday.   A week and a half later, I came here with fellow yelpers for the monthly International Supper Club UYE. This time I decided to try distinctly Salvadoran dishes, so I ordered pupusa with cheese and loroco (flower buds of the loroco vine) and relleno de pacaya (made with the inflorescence of the pacaya palm tree). There was only the slightest hint of loroco flowers in the pupusas - a bit of a disappointment; the pupusas tasted good, but the lack of loroco flavor made it almost indistinguishable from a regular pupusa con queso. The relleno de pacaya turned out to be an acquired taste: it was definitely different, but the bitterness of the palm flower stalks was not something I really fancied. I enjoyed the \"ensalada\" beverage, which was a cold refreshing sweet drink with what seemed to me to be flavors of melon, apple, and citrus. Desert was atol de elote, which was something of a dessert soup with a sweet creamy \"broth\" and sweet corn kernels, with a sprinkling of cinnamon on top. It was pleasant and refreshing.  Five stars from the first visit, three stars for the second visit - that averages out to 4 stars for my experience here."}
{"text":"Me and my dear friend came here to the GQ (Guanaquito) for one thing and one thing only the pupusas (revueltas de queso) and they were very good but a little burnt on the edges to my liking on their flat top griddle.  The added bonus that I was able to get unlimited salvadorean coleslaw AKA curtido. 3 refills with a bit of heat  Thank you very much!    The place is super chill on a weekday afternoon. They had a soccer game on the Tube when we stopped by there. The service is friendly too.  So if I were U please don't pupu on the pupusas here...Don't miss out on the GQ!  A 4 star pupusas and curtido in the desert!"}
{"text":"Sweet sweet papusas how have I lived without you in my life? First time, won't be the last, I'll be on the hunt for you. I thought they were like two great mashed potato (although not made from potato, but similar consistency) pancakes smashed together like a fabulous grilled cheese, browned and crisp in spots..Oh heaven."}
{"text":"Was craving pupusas and the Salvadorean restaurants in Phoenix are scarce but luckily the best is close to my house. Boyfriend and I each got the order of bean and cheese pupusas it comes with a side of rice and beans for 7.99! Neither of us could eat the third one so we have a pupusa for later enjoyment.  The service here was awesome! They warmly welcome you and food is fresh and hot! Will be back to try their fried banana burrito with a side of ice cream!!"}
{"text":"A long time ago (7 years) in a land far far away (Boston), I had my first and only encounter with the tastiest of little Frisbee shaped dishes.  The papusa has been a fascination of mine ever since I first sampled it.  There was just something about the texture of the dough and the variety of different stuffings in the middle.  Not at all like a quesadilla.  Salvadorans basically do this magic trick where the filling almost tastes like it's been part of the dough all along.  I've craved that texture since but in Phoenix papusas aren't easy to find.  But living Downtown has once again enabled me to satisfy another ethnic food hankering as Guanaquito has apparently been hiding in plain sight all along.  On a Friday at lunch, I made my move.  Guanaquito is a place that might intimidate a gringo coming here for the first time.  The building is old and (at least on the exterior) uninviting looking.  First know that both the parking and entrance are in the back.  When I entered the place was pretty busy, and low and behold I was the only English speaking gringo in the place.  Don't worry though, the staff is super friendly and speaks perfectly good English.  The restaurant interior itself is fairly divvy, but the aroma and happy vibes were more than enough to sooth any doubt in my mind.  Other than Papusas, I knew basically jack squat about Salvadoran food going into my visit here.  I did some light research on Salvadoran Food on Wikipedia and settled on what I thought would be the most authentic experience.  For starters I went with a large Tamarindo.  Basically a citrus punch using a tropical fruit called tamarind.  Not nearly as tangy as a fruit punch, but still very refreshing.  They brought out a small chips and salsa bowl along with it.  For the main event, I went with what seems to be Salvadoran cuisine 101 at this place.  The Plato Tipico.  Oddly the items in this dish are not described on the menu (and I forgot to ask the waitress), but I pretty much figured it out.  Of course there's the papusas which come with your choice of fillings (I went with cheese and pork for both), two small beef & potato empanadas, a tamale wrapped in banana leaf with what (I think) was pork and cheese filling, and what I believe were fried fingerling plantains.  The dish also came with a vinegar coleslaw which you can add to pretty much anything on your plate.  First off, the papusas.  As good as I remember.  Hot, soft, and despite being thin were packed full of that cheese and pork I was hoping for.  The dough was cooked perfectly and was perfect with or without the coleslaw.   The beef empanadas were also delicious (and piping hot).  Plenty of meat along with some potato and a hint of veggie in each.  The crust of the empanadas was firm but flaky and not greasy at all.  The tamale was fantastic in large part because of the texture of the masa.  Maybe it was the way it was cooked in the banana leaf, but that was some of the best masa I've ever had on a tamale.  The super tender meat and cheese filling inside the tamale was equally up to the task.  The fingerlings had a tasty subtle sweetness note that rounded out the dish quite nicely.    Feeling bullish about dessert, I ordered a quesadilla.  Now this is not a quesadilla like a Mexican quesadilla would be.  This is basically a Salvadoran version of a cheesecake (or at least that's how it's described).  Two mistakes I made on this.  First off, when I ordered it, I didn't get just a slice or a sample of the quesadilla.  I literally got the entire quesadilla.  Great value for the price, but that was a bit of a shocker.  Second mistake was that I didn't realize the quesadilla was effectively a dry cake.  Picture a cheesecake in cornbread form and that's basically what it was.  It wasn't bad, but the portion was way too large to be consumed by one.  Plus I was expecting something more closely resembling an American cheesecake.  Rookie mistake on my part, and to be clear I didn't ask the waitress for a description.  I just made a guess based on limited information and I guessed wrong.  Plain and simple.  Total price for the Tamarindo, Plato Tipico, Quesadilla, tax and tip came to about $25.  Tremendous value for the amount of food (and the quality) you get.  As mentioned earlier, the service was friendly and I felt perfectly at home here despite my (obvious) lack of familiarity with the cuisine.  Next time I'm here I'll dive deeper into the menu for their seafood and other desserts.  All in all, really good first impression.  Papusa itch scratched....for now."}
{"text":"The place might be easy to miss and I'll say that living right down the street and just happen to find it thanks to yelp! We'll I was looking for popusas and this place showed up. It was a little difficult figuring out where the entrance was since it's next to a building and has a small entrance to the back parking lot. Place looks very sketchy outside and as your walking in. So we decided to try a combo that came with that delicious  Curtido. Popusas were amazing! That is all I have tried and I keep going back just for that. I gave it four stars just because service could have been better. But this place is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"So I HAD to write a review about one of the few Salvadorean places in town since I myself am half-Salvadorean! I took my mom and grandma here last week to celebrate a birthday and I thought the experience was fine. Of course the only thing I ordered were three papusas and an horchata, the classic Salvadorean dish. It was yummy and I had no complaints. My mom was disappointed that they didn't have any rice papusas and that they were just made out of regular ol' masa. My fiance tried the \"Plato Tipico\" and found it to be \"delicious fried finger food\". Don't expect this place to wow you based on appearances only because to be honest, it looks kinda shady..."}
{"text":"As others have said this place is hidden barely could see the sign on the front of the building.  The food is decent i ordered the shrimp fajitas the tortillas they use are thick and small making it kind of hard to eat with but they are good. Its overpriced overall for food and service waited 20 min for a refill on my drink and waited over an hr on the food which we went at 11am and hardly anyone was in there."}
{"text":"This place is like having a dirty little secret. It is almost as if it's only for the dive/hole in the wall elite. It's like an exclusive little club with knowledge of the entrance to this place... No sign, no front door, no parking directions... A mystery. A maze. A secret. Unless you speak Spanish and have heard about this place from every single Central American you know (ahem, thus how I discovered it.) My friends still approach the place uneasily when I first take them there, but once they eat they become Salvadoreans at heart. Pupusas and Platanos Fritos are my favorite items from this place!  Being of Salvadorean descent I can approve this place as seriously legit! It's super cheap as well! Why can't it be pupusa day every day? Because then I would become a whale. For those cheat days,  This place hits the spot! Real curtido and salsa, none of that fake or \"Mexicanized\" flavor (yes there is a difference lol) I really want a pupusa now...  :-)"}
{"text":"This place is my go to spot for Salvadorean food in Phoenix. The Plato Tipico is a must try simply DELICIOUS!!!! , it includes all the Goodies that El Salvador is known for... The service is always friendly and prompt... HANDS DOWN!!! The best Salvadoren food in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, this place looks like it would be located in the slums of San Salvador.. sketchy area, bars on the window, almost looks lifeless from the street. \"Never judge a book by its cover\" definitely applies to this place. This place has some good and very authentic Salvadorian food. Came here and got my usual choice of salvi treats, pupusas revueltas, pastelitos, platanitos and an ice cold agua de ensalada... AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and never thought to stop in until it was recommended to me by someone who works for Yelp.  They told me it was their \"go to\" place to enjoy some tasty Salvadoran food.  We stopped in this weekend and I thoroughly enjoyed my pupusa plate - zucchini & cheese, bean & cheese, and beef & cheese with a side of rice and beans.  The portions were huge, so I ended up taking half of my meal home with me to enjoy for lunch the next day.  Friendly staff and tasty food makes for a winning combination!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from Los Angeles- this place was exactly what we were looking for. The pupusas, corrida, horchata, sopa de pollo, pan con pavo, and ensalada were delicious. The service was great. The pupusas remind me of my abuelita's cooking. Exactly what I needed."}
{"text":"I was near here and decided to stop here for lunch with a friend.   The location itself is hidden. They have signage, however the parking and entrance are a little tricky as they are in the back and tricky to find. Don't give up! It's well worth the trouble.   The space is simple and clean. The booths were a little strange but ambiance is not the thing here. This is my reason for 4 stars.   The service was good, friendly and informative. I had some questions on the menu and about how to eat the food and she was helpful.   The food is so delish. They started with some complimentary chips and salsa. We ordered the pupusa platter and it was so.darn.good! They are pan fried pancake sized corn masa discs stuffed with savory ingredients. I had the chicarron, bean and cheese and also a cheese and blossom (I don't recall the name of the flower but it added such a delicate taste to the cheese and masa). Everything was well seasoned, fresh and tasty. I will definitely be back. I didn't have dessert but I saw an order of the banana burrito with ice cream that left me wishing I had room for it. Til we meet again! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food family friendly The food was hot and served in a timely manner. I had the Plato Tipico (Sampler) it came with fried plantains they were very crunchy, 2 meat empanadas with papas they were average, 2 papusas with beans and cheese they were good but a little too greasy, a carnitas tamale wrapped in a banana leaf in my opinion it was the best. To drink I had the agua fresca ensalada de fruta it was really good.  Staff was kind and it was clean a little worn but homely and welcoming."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about authentic Salvadoran food: warm, gooey pupusas, fried yuca that crackles in your mouth, savory rice and beans, warm tortillas with your food, cold and perfect horchata to wash it all down, and perfect, oh, just perfect soups.  The beef foot soup (\"sopa de pata\") is the best soup I have had in Phoenix, filled with all the bits and pieces they can throw in there (tendon, mondongo, bones...) and lots of veggies and roots and other greens, it makes me smile, my stomach growl, and I want more every week.  The staff at Guanaquito is friendly and willing to explain what you do not know, and even though they may be a bit slow, they let you eat in peace.  Yes, the parking sitation is a bit \"iffy\", but when are really good eats found in well-lit places?  Gems like \"El Guanaquito\" are worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Customer service was good. Just not what we expected. Tastes like a dry version of Mexican food."}
{"text":"As a LA native, I have eaten a lot of different Latin American cuisines, yet, never Salvadoran. Vising Arizona, we noticed that it's basically a hotbed of authentic Latin American cuisines. Guanquito may look a bit worn out on the outside, among the streets of multi colored, box shaped stores in similar states. Park in the back because the entrance is only from the back and not the front. It was pretty empty when we went in for a late lunch but quickly filled up as time passed. After ordering, they bough chips and salsa for everyone to munch on in attempts to abate that hunger. I got the chicken with white sauce and my friends got various items. It was really good. The chicken breast that it came with was tender and fell apart as I dug my fork through it. Rice was flavorful as well. The horchata is extremely cinnamon-y and sweet. The Salvadorian coffee was nearly pure white and tasted like milk.  Still, it was a good, filling lunch. The service was good. Definitely a place to stop by before heading back home."}
{"text":"I'm Salvadoran therefore may hold high expectations. I continue to go there because the pupusas are reliably good as are the platanos fritos. The tamales de pollo were not my fav. And the curtido and salsa can use a bit of work. Oh and dont expect much ambiance or customer service. I usually do take out. But it's a good place if you're craving pupusas."}
{"text":"Papusa, its fun to say and also to eat.  Paaaa poooooo sahhhh  I went in with a few coworkers time time with the goal of ordering 100% papusa. Which I did including a new Jalapeño papusa.   This new Jalapeño papusa at $2.00 is .25  more than the rest but well worth it. Lightly spicy cheese and corny it was great.  I also had a cheese papusa but it was just bland.  The chips and salsa were like that of any Mexican place now, no more popcorn tasting chips. The side of Salvadorian slaw was nice.   On a fun side note my co worker got the \"French style chicken\"  which was 3 breaded chicken breasts over pasta with a lemon butter sauce.  What compelled him to get French food that looked like Italian food at a Salvadorian place I will never know."}
{"text":"Holy pupusas! Come to this place now.  This place is unassuming, a good amount of parking as well. Inside you can tell they're not spending the money on the decor, which they really don't need to. The restaurant has a ton of tables though, it's very straightforward.  I ordered the bean and cheese pupusas and the carne asada plate. Both were amazing, the pupusas were so darn good. This is my new spot because I may not like the Mexican food in AZ but the Salvadoran spot is a winner. Come here, eat and just enjoy the flavors.  Very happy to have found them on Yelp."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this place after reading the wonderful Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed!  There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  Our server was very pleasant, the place was clean, and service was quick.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals (he had the Plato Tipico, I had the bean & cheese pupusas with rice & beans) and look forward to returning for more."}
{"text":"I love that this place is nearly unrecognizable from the street. And that you don't hear a word of english being spoken. You know you're in for good food at that point.   I had papusas and a random sampler - and my favorite fried plantain with beans and sour cream.   This was good - better than Eliana's yes - but both are pretty damn good. And i felt like this place was Phoenix - super seedy exterior, lots of espanol, and good food in a strip mall - Phoenix to a tee."}
{"text":"Some of the best Salvadorian food I've had, especially the pupusas.. Very authentic and delicious food. The food gave my dad memories of growing up in El Salvador.... the horchata is ok but kind of tastes like it has a hint of bubblegum flavor for some reason and I wish their tamales had green olives in them like I'm used to having. Other than that, no complaints. It's a great hole in the wall and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I popped in quickly to see if they took debit the girl behind the counter looked at me blankly and then at her father at least I am assuming thats what he was. He answered for her that they do so I told them I would return. I was early in meeting Amanda B. and Kevin H. so I parked myself at a table. I speak Spanish, does it say that some where on my forehead??? People seem to just \"KNOW\" this for some reason. Even when I responded in English they continued to speak Spanish to me here. I finally gave in and went with it, the girl said \"Ah so you do speak Spanish\" like it was some sort of test. She was very polite she did not speak English though and I basically translated for everyone throughout the meal. I have not had El Salvadoran in a really long time so I don't really have anything to compare. I deducted a star because everything had pork bits in it except the salsa and tortillas. I would go again if I was in the area, next time I will clarify no meat when I order.  Bean & Cheese Pupusa - awesome very good minus the pork Chile Relleno - very good, totally different than Mex. on the inside it was stuffed full of pork, potato and carrots among other stuff it reminded me of a stew minus the liquid. Horchata - Fresh from scratch very very delicious and sweet sugar high achieved  I would like to try the soups they looked good and a little pricey.  Thanks to Kevin for getting the tip you and Amanda are wonderful company!"}
{"text":"A Salvadorian Gem  Guanaquito  is a family-owned restaurant tucked in an unassuming building on the North side of McDowell Road in Phoenix.  Guanaquito is an affordable  restaurant that serves traditional Salvadorean cuisine. I would recommend the papusas, stuffed cheese, beans, and pork.  the Papusas are accompanied by a pickled cabbage mixture called curtido and salsa roja, a thin and flavorful tomato sauce. Our entrees were flavorful, prepared perfectly, and plated nicely.  If you want to be adventurous and try something a little different I would recommend the fried yucca root flower relleno, it's flavorful and absolutely delicious.   Lunch for two for under 20 bucks. It doesn't get any better.  If your in the area give Guanaquito a try."}
{"text":"Finding out how to gain access to this place is the greatest barrier to its success (it's a challenge), after you figure it out, brush up on your highschool spanish then be wowed by some pretty darn good pupusas.    The juevos con chorizo are smokey and delicious and blow my mind each time I get em."}
{"text":"First time having Salvadorian food and was very impressed at this restaurant. Had the pupusas and loved them. Would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Their pupusas are the best and you can't go wrong with a pupusa plate!  I don't usually think much about rice, but they do something very special to their rice and it is super delicious.  The beans have great flavor but are really soupy.  Great value for delicious pupusas!!  I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is defintiely a hole in the wall, but aren't all the best finds that way? Their horchata was delicious. Creamy and authentic, without being to cinnamon-y. I was also a HUGE fan of their papussas and empanadas. Amazing!. I did not like their take on chile relleno though. It was a stuffed piece of the palm flower they use and it tasted acrid. Maybe it's a flavor that grows on you. Also wasn't too impressed by how clean the place felt, but the old pictures of the Valley in the 30s were pretty cool.  Overall, good food and totally reasonably priced, but i would've loved to have a beer with my dinner. Only juices and sodas at this place."}
{"text":"Met my son, his girlfriend and her kids here the day we arrived in Phoenix.  We got a little turned around so they had already eaten some food.  We ordered papussas and empanadas.  Some had the fruit juice with all these little bits of fruit floating about.  It was too sweet for me but those who drank it loved this concoction.  Had chips and salsa and the frys were really good.  It was fun eating here even though the first impression was where did they take us.  The owners and waitreass were so nice and it was my first time eating Salvadoran food.  Just for that I had a great time.  I would go back now when I return to sunny Ariazona."}
{"text":"Lots of food! We had the Plata Tipica and El Order de Papusas with horchata and sopa de gallina. Everything was good and inexpensive. Friendly family running the house.  A bit chilly in the dining room. My least favorite was the tamal  but that's because I prefer Mexican style tamales."}
{"text":"Authentic, authentic, authentic! This the last gleaming hope of Salvadoran food in Arizona. I've tried other spots not even close. They literally have every dish that comes to mind with the rare ingredients. Prices are something worthy of a dive bar.....very affordable. This location is much larger than the last place. The only thing that sucks is that they don't have their liquor license yet."}
{"text":"Really good Pupupas.. Its like a hole on the wall, the place might be ugly from the outside but I do recommend the food. In matter fact, I am on my way to get some pupusas for luch.. Their only 1.75 ea.. You cant beat that."}
{"text":"If you dine-in, you'll receive complimentary chips and salsa, which were great. I come here exclusively for the papusas. They're delicious and affordable at only $2-$2.30 a piece."}
{"text":"This is the best Salvadoreño food in the Valley. Hands down. I have tried ALL of the other Salvadoreño restaurants in the valley and they dont match the quality and taste of the food.  We have gone there many times and tried the following meals: pupusas, yucca frita con chicharrones, tamales de pollo and tamales de elote, sopa de res, sopa de patas, and chilate con nuegados and all of it tastes amazing.  Excellent food!"}
{"text":"I had this placed bookmarked for a while since I love pupusas. Today I decided to give it a try since they were literally right next to where I was at. The entrance is in the back so go up 15th from Mcdowell and turn into the alley way to get to the back.   I ordered a bunch of pupusas and took them back to where I was at to eat. I ordered multiples of the pork, pork and cheese, cheese and loroco, and one with everything in it. They are incredibly cheap coming in at about $2 each. They come with salsa and a slaw. I like to eat them with everything on top because it really adds to the flavor. I didn't have any of the plain pork ones but my friend said they were really good. The ones I got all had cheese in them and the cheese was really nice and gooey. There was a decent amount of stuffing inside each one, making the stuffing to masa tortilla ratio very equal. I have never heard of loroco before and had to Google it before ordering it, but it is a type of edible flower. I actually think that one was my favorite. It didn't have a super floral taste to it but it was nice to have a fresh component to the pupusa. They chop the flowers up and mix it in well with the cheese. I wish the salsa was spicy. It was extremely mild. I'm not sure if they have anything spicier but that's what they gave me. The slaw was crisp and the sauce on it was good.   I also ordered some flan. I believe it is pre-made and bought from an outside company. The flan was good. I wish there was more of the sauce with the flan but there's nothing the restaurant can do about that since I think they don't make it. The flan was a little thicker and I really liked that. It was pretty creamy.   I would definitely come back for more pupusas!"}
{"text":"Awesome pupusas! I was getting home sick and looked up Salvadorian restaurants and found this treasure(I'm not from Arizona)...the ensalada (fruit juice with pieces of fruit in it was awesome and the pupusas were so good!! So glad I stoped by! We were greeted by nice people! Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Guanaquito was the place picked for April's International Supper Club UYE, and this is truly a place you can't judge by its outsides.  From the outside, it looks pretty sketchy but one you walk in your put at ease.  I knew before I got there that all I wanted was beans, rice and flour tortillas, its simple and it was what I was craving.  So after checking out the menu I went with Orden de Pupusas, it was 3 pupusas, beans, rice and a cabbage slaw of sorts.    If you are unsure of what pupusas are, they are like a smaller thicker flour tortilla and are stuffed in the middle. The 3 I ordered were stuffed with beans and cheese, this was the perfect meal for me, just what I was craving. The surprising part of the meal though was the rice, this was some really good rice, I am not really a rice person, but this rice was just perfect. The cabbage slaw, which isn't even the correct way of describing it, was the perfect topping for the pupusas.   Now I am looking forward to going back and trying out other items on the menu, everyone's dish looked great!"}
{"text":"Two words sum it up; tasty and filling.  We started with the Plato Tipico which is a fried appetizer sampler and includes a chicken tamale, two beef  & papa empanadas, two papusas and  yucca fries. I was loving the bean and cheese filled papusa and my friend was all about the tamale.  I ordered the avocado salad hopping it would be on the exotic side but it was just a standard dinner salad topped with sliced avocado. Aside from our appetizer and salad, we ordered an additional round of pork, cheese and bean papusas. All were very good and were the main reason for our visit. However, after looking at the rest of the menu, we'll be back to try the carne asada platter and relleno plates.  All in all, a deliciously satisfying meal and definitely a spot I will return to again and again.  Note: Parking is out back and they close at 8:30."}
{"text":"I went to Guanaquito Saturday afternoon to get some to go pupusas.  We live within walking distance of the place, and honestly, from the front of the building facing McDowell it looks like nothing at all. I would see this place driving by and be like\" How the hell does a restaurant survive there?\". Thankfully, I ran along the place on Yelp!   Wow. I can't believe I was not more daring before now. I got 4 pupusas to go for my husband and me. While waiting, I noticed that the place is very clean and reminds me a lot of some restaurants in Mexico (although not a Mexican restaurant).   The man who took my order and money was very nice and he explained how to put the sauce and slaw on them if I so wished. I didn't like the sauce or slaw once I tasted them but, who cares, you don't need it.   We got the pork and cheese pupusas and they were out of this world! So fresh and yummy. Two pupusas each was a nice little lunch along with a beer (at home). The place needs to get beer is the only thing lacking!   We will be going back and it will be nice to be able to walk over!"}
{"text":"I came here based on reviews comparing it to Eliiana's, considering I had never even seen it (it's pretty well hidden). And my philosophy is, any place with papusa deserves a shot.   Me & my BF went at around 7pm, and parked in the back. It felt a little creepy, but still...papusas are calling, so we entered.   It's a no frills establishment, with a larger variety of foods and papusas than Eliana's. We shared the sampler (for comparisons) and some chicken leg entree...it really wasn't all that interesting.   The sampler plate was pretty similar to Eliana's, but they give you more (for more money, of course). The papusas, however, were the bomb (do people still use that term? Bomb?). WAAAAY better than Eliana's. And I'm told the ensalda drink was WAAAAY better too, but that is not my cup 'o tea. The tortillas served with the main entree were a little dry, so I'm siding with Eliana's tortillas. Serves was friendly, but not quite the waitress type service you get from Eliana's. We ordered up front, and then sat down. Then the food was brought to us.   So basically, I still like Eliana's more for their main dishes and tiny cup of chicken soup. But I'll come here for papusa lunches....many of them.   Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"We went to eat some pupusas de queso con loroco. Never again. The loroco is almost invisible, plus they charge you extra for the loroco that is missing. Pupusas are also smaller than at other restaurants. We complained to the waitress but nothing was done. We  were so disappointed that we went home and made some real pupusas de queso y loroco."}
{"text":"We returned for lunch today and this place didn't disappoint. We had essentially the same dishes we ate the last time I reviewed this eatery, and the experience was about equal. For some reason the Facebook page lists this place as likely permanently closed. I called and they told me they were open and didn't know how to fix the page. Patronize this family run restaurant. We spent a few minutes conversing with the owner and he's a very delightful man. If I was to review the food I would rewrite what I posted here on 8/29/2015."}
{"text":"I've had this restaurant bookmarked for awhile now and finally decided to head over the other day. I've read the reviews about the restaurant being hidden, but if you go during the day, I don't think you will have a problem because we didn't.   Our waitress was really friendly and since we have never been to the restaurant and have never tried Salvadorean food before, we asked for her recommendations. We first started with the horchata and the ensalada for beverages, which we both enjoyed. The free chips and salsa was a nice perk, but the salsa was very light and tasted like tomato sauce. I don't think I as a big fan.   We settled for the Plato Tipico: a sampler of the pupusas, pasteles (meat pies) and a tamale. The plate was definitely enough for two people. You actually pick the two pupusas you want so we ordered the chicharon and the revueltas. Overall, I thought the food was fine. I guess I probably should've ordered more meat because the plate was just full of carbs.   I'll probably be back but I will order a plate with more meat next time. Prices are inexpensive - Our bill was under $20."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, one of the best Sopa de Res, and my mom  and tia Chela make the best!! Good atmosphere, family friendly place."}
{"text":"Busy sat afternoon came in at 230. Parking is in the back. Just west of 15th St. Lovely find.  Decorated like your their country. Food is amazing definitely return to try more."}
{"text":"I am in love.  This humble restaurant is so well hidden I drove past it twice a day for nine years without realizing its hidden delights.  The food is fresh, hot, and authentic.  Such reasonable prices too!  Salvadoran cuisine is a fantastic alternative to tiresome Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is literally one hidden gem, because structurally, the door to enter this Sanvadoran restaurant was not the one facing the street. We had to drive through the back alley next to the torn down fences, and look for the little blue door in order to find the restaurant. Thankfully, the six of us found the interior to be much larger than the narrow doorway. There was a large counter facing the two dining areas with booths and tables vertically arranged. The divey disposition largely depended on natural lighting, and the casual, down-to-earth atmosphere was home-like and inclusive. Like other pupuserias I had previously visited, they also have TVs to keep the soccer fans entertained.   The Oden de Pupusas ($6.99) came with three medium-sized pupusas, refried beans, rice, and slaw. The pupusas were not as firm, plump, or fully filled as the ones in other restaurants, but the flavors were still remarkable. Our order came with the Cheese and Lorocco, Beans and Cheese, and Pork and Cheese Pupusas, and the combination of the savory and sweet flavors really hit the spot. Additionally, their rice and refried beans were smooth, nicely seasoned, and highly addictive. Santi recently ordered their new Squash Pupusa ($2), and the subtleties of the shredded squash made it worth getting.  The Sopa de Gallina ($8.99) came with a large bowl of chicken vegetable soup, broiled chicken, rice, salad, and tortilla. The soup was boiling hot, with a chicken flavor that took center stage and loaded with noodles and assorted vegetables. The broiled chicken breast was dry, but still immensely flavorful and crispy on the edges. The tortilla was thick, doughy, and carried a good chew. I would be interested in getting this dish again, but most likely with dark meat instead.  The Filete de Pescado en Salsa Marta ($10.99) arrived with grilled sea bass dressed in a white sauce, refried beans, rice, and salad. The bass was fresh, buttery, and easy to fork into. The creamy white sauce did not overwhelm the flavor of the fish, and the rice and beans were consistent and tasty as the previous.  Overall, their pupusas were very good, but not the best I have ever tasted. The other dishes were also memorable, and it was obvious that they made their food with pride. Additionally, I also find the slaw to my liking, as it was not peppered with oregano that often can induce a strange metallic flavor. We were also given plenty of chips and salsa before the meal, but our food always came out fast with outstanding temperature. Service was kind, attentive, and responsive. I would be very interested in coming back to try their Sopa de Patas and Sopa de Camaron y Pescado. 3.5 stars for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Good for mainly POPUSAS!!!! The place is located in a sketchy area and if you look around it almost seems not worth to try it. Forget about appearances and just sit for some Popusas!!! Their menu is in Spanish and  English, but people mainly speak Spanish, so if you want to practice a little...go ahead."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a little sketchy on the outside because you have to go through a small door in the back entrance but it is so worth it.  I can't really comment on any of the other food, but damn these were some of the best pupusas I've ever had, and definitely the best in the valley. This literal hole in the wall is a can't miss."}
{"text":"My coworkers invited me to come here, and I had never heard of it is I decided to try something new. They go for the pupusas and rave about them. I ordered the cheese and loroca one and it was yum, kinda reminds me of a pancake. I would've tried the bean and cheese one but it's not vegetarian (they use chicken broth). We all ordered horchata drinks which I enjoyed very much, it's got a different kick than Mexican horchata. They started us out with chips and salsa which were good, and I like the cabbage salad. I made the mistake of ordering the shrimp cocktail, I expected it to come on the side like in the picture but it was in the sauce. I also expected it to be typical red cocktail sauce but it was more like a pico de gallo. Anyways, this was a nice family owned place tucked away on McDowell and you have to enter from the back (which is funky but I felt gives it an authentic feel). I'd come back for the pupusas."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a little girl . I'm salvadorian myself and their pupusas are the best in AZ !!"}
{"text":"Best pupusas in Phoenix. The quality is amazing, and price is even better. Their agua de ensalada never disappoints. The budin is Delicious but they don't always have it fresh on Thursdays but when they do it's a must have. They have recently made the salsa that goes with the pupusas too spicy for my liking, it's suppose to be sweet but they have made it spicy almost like Mexican salsa. Overall great food."}
{"text":"Food is perfect. Best plantains I've ever had. The popusas are perfection and what I crave. My mom had caldo de res and says it's the best she's ever had. Would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. I was previously partial to Eliana's, but after enjoying this restaurant the last couple of weeks, I think I've switched over.  Excellent pupussa's. Just delicious. The empanada's are great as well. A litle tough ordering if you don't speak spanish, but the food gets to you eventually either way.   Definately a big thumbs up here"}
{"text":"Grew up eating Salvadorian food! I had the Plato typico, the Pupusas were good, the tamal de pollo had good flavor, the yucca was perfectly fried, the pastellitos were ok (not my favorite). The horchata was very good but the ensalada was a disappointment. The quesadilla de pan wasn't my favorite. Probably the best Salvadorian food I've had in the Phoenix area..."}
{"text":"The food is extremely good. The people are very nice. Near my office, too, so I will probably start calling in my order and picking it up for lunch during weekdays!!! The desserts are good, too."}
{"text":"Service was great, waitress nicely answered all of our questions. The food was also great, hard to find good Salvadoran food in AZ. I highly recommend the tamales and of course the papusas. Server said everything homemade too!!"}
{"text":"Totally unassuming place that serves up good food at a good value and offers a decent ambiance. Get the popusas and Salvadoran Tamales. Yum!"}
{"text":"Like other reviews, this place is all about authenticity. I have tried various sandwiches here which were all fantastic. The Sampler Appetizer Papusas are always a good call.   I'm not sure if they understand what unsweet ice tea was but mine was super duper sweet. Maybe avoid that if you are looking for standard unsweet ice tea. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new. Plantains are wonderful as well so don't be shy with those bad boys."}
{"text":"Great authentic Salvadoran food.  Modest decor, unpretentious.  Just plain good homemade food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Excellent service and great flavor seasoning. You won't get wrong walking in."}
{"text":"Another amazing mom and pop shop! This place is soooo good. The food has that \"I made this\" taste to it. The place truly has that small place feel....but its worth the try. I LOVE their papusas! And being Puerto Rican...their fritura is on point! Check them out..."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable. I have tried several El Salavadorian restaurants but this is by far the best one in the city. The Papusas are so delicious that after eating then one time I have been back every week because I crave them! The cheese and Loroco Papusas are the best choice. Order them with the traditional salad, beans and cream (The cream is similar to sour cream but much lighter and much more delicious). The fried yuca is delicious too. I would like to try other items but I am so hooked on these traditional gems that I can't help but order this plate every time I come. As if the incredible food was not enough, the service is top notch. Every waitress is attentive and pleasant.  And you cannot beat the prices either. 2 can easily eat for $20. Try it...you will thank me :)"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food, and affordable prices.   The cheese and bean papusas were good. I had the house special fish fillet with salsa malta and she had the camerones plancha. We both enjoyed our meals and will likely return in the future."}
{"text":"Best Salvadoran food in Phoenix. Clean, great service, friendly staff I have nothing bad to say. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up.  Our first foray into Salvadoran cuisine.  Half the fun was working out what we wanted with our poor Spanish and the servers poor English.  We weren't very hungry since we had been to Lo-Lo's just a short time before.  The plan was to share 2 entree's between the four of us at Lo-Lo's and then finish our dinner at Guanaquito.  Well, two plates  at Lo-Lo's and the four of us were nearly full.  So we didn't order much at Guanaquito.  Four pupusas:  cheese, bean & cheese, pork and beef.  They were all very good.  I enjoyed the grilled flavor of the bread very much.  Having each bite with cabbage and some hot sauce was tasty indeed.  We also tried some fried yucca.  It was OK but very much like thick cut french fries."}
{"text":"Really tried to like this place but the food was very bland :/ They need more options for people that don't eat pork besides just cheese. The staff was very nice and the presentation of the food was great! Sadly wish I could've liked the food more."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and loved it every time. my favorite items are the popusas, pan con pollo, and the sopa De pata. If you like menudo you'll like the sopa De pata. I give all the credit to my girlfriend for introducing me to this place. I owe her big time. Yummy yummy for the tummy."}
{"text":"Guanaquito is affordable and the service was fine, but the food was a disappointment.  Even though we read many good reviews, we found it hard to swallow.  The food was bland for the most part, the salsa was more like tomato sauce, and the pickled cabbage looked tired.  The pupusas looked good but were a bit doughy.  My companion did enjoy her relleno though."}
{"text":"Came her with my wife and daughter on a whim. We saw a sticker in the back of a truck that said \"I love pupusas\" on our way to Applebees and my wife asked what those were. After telling her she set to finding a place we could get them.  This place came up with some of the best reviews so we made the trek across the valley to try them.  At first I was struck by the lack of people in the place but as we sat I got more comfortable. The staff made sure we were comfortable and all our needs met.  The food was delicious! I can't speak highly enough of it.   You can't add a tip to your credit card receipt so bring cash."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Thats a pretty good way of putting it! If your into Salvadoran Food or if you are not this is your place.  Located near 14th street and McDowell the building is near a chinese place in an old white building.  You have to park in the back and at first glance you may question yourself for choosing this place.  But it really is worth it.  Once you get inside the place is spotless.  Very well kept.  The menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises.    I got the Carne Asada plate.  The steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It came with yellow rice, beans, a salad, and tortillas.  The tortillas were thick and grilled.  I also shared a bean and cheese papusa.  The papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese.  You have to try it.  Our meal came with chips and salsa and a salvadorian slaw mixture to share.    The price was right and the staff is friendly food A++++++++  Good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed."}
{"text":"My exfiance took me to this place because he knew how much I just love Salvadorean food!  The popusas were delicious and seriously cheap! Very satisfying!  Try their horchata it's to die for!  My ex had their tamales and he said they were very good.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  If Im ever in town again this is where I will go. :)"}
{"text":"Just went here based on some lovely yelpers reviews and you did not let me down! Wow the food was so good, and the owner/staff were very pleasant.  I just got 3 bean and cheese stuffed corn tortillas, rice and more beans for $6.99 and it was all incredible.   You have to enter through the back, the parking lot is a little sketchy feeling right when you pull in but when you park there's plenty of lighting over the back door. Try it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious popusas. I highly recommend this place. And they did move location, they are at the old Chinese restaurant location."}
{"text":"Amazing pupusas! Very authentic! A little hard to find at first and you have to park in the back. We have pupusas every time we are in LA and these are just as good. Also get the platanos!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple friday's ago with friends. We all got the same thing the meat and cheese filled papusa meal. I love papusas and this place is legit on these. Im not a fan of black beans so I get the pinto beans with the meal. I ordered the horchata thinking it was going to taste like every other horchata I have had. El salvadorian horchata is not the same as your typical Mexican horcahata, and it was not to my liking. I took some food to go for Javier, but he said he was not a fan, may have been since it was not fresh. Beware when you go to this place, it is straight in the middle of the hood and looks sketchy. You drive to the back and park in the dark parking lot and enter through the back. Do not let this scare you away because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm half salvadorian and grew up eating many of the meals on the menu. Coming here makes me feel nostalgic. And everything is so delicious! It's always worth the trip coming from Ahwatukee. I've tried many pupusas throughout Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa... El Guanaquito tops them all. The owner is a humble, timid yet very friendly man, as well as the entire staff."}
{"text":"After sadly missing the ISC here in May, I knew I had to make it here eventually to try some Salvadoran food. Upon arrival, I wasn't sure how delicious the food would be as it isn't the most beautiful restaurant in the world. Luckily, you can't judge a book by its cover. I tried the bean and cheese and loroca pupusas, corn tamale, fried banana with beans, meat empanada type things, and the dessert banana empanadas. The food was so ridic tasty, especially the loroca pupusa.... what is loroca? Some kind of flower herb... I have no idea, but it was flavorful and fantastic. The bananas were caramelized and delicious. The tamale was a bit dry, but still tasty. The meat pie things were probably my least favorite item, but still not bad. The dessert... ohhh the dessert was good. Fried banana with some kind of white deliciousness inside (the waitress said it was milk, it had the consistency of rice pudding.... I didn't want to ask anything else haha) rolled in sugar. It was great. I will definitely return to this fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. This was my first time trying Salvadorian food. The suggestions by the waiters was very good. I would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"The reason I give this place a four star rating is because there is only one server but I need at least three or four because this place gets hectic very full!! But the 4 stars are well earned!! The pupusas are delicious and authentic !! So is the steak huevos rice and beans mixed. The platano was also a good side! I'll come back again."}
{"text":"The food was not as expected this time. The service was not the best either. They were charging us way more in tax. Current Phoenix sales tax is 8.6% and we were being charged 9%. I would definitely make sure your check is correct. We will no longer be returning. They spoiled a family evening meal with dishonesty and bad customer service.  Also, it wouldn't hurt for them to do some upholstery cleaning on their booth seating."}
{"text":"****Entrance is in the back******  This an attractively unusual restaurant situated inside of what looks like an industrial strip mall with store fronts.  This place is not easy to see from the street because it is in the middle of this industrial looking strip mall.  Be mindful of that. The drive to turn into the rear parking lot is just west of the building.  The building is on the north side of McDowell.   This was the perfect place for a Sunday afternoon dinner.  A lot of families coming in for Sunday dinner and tons of laughter and friendly banter filled the room.  The menu is full of Sal Vadorian favorites and I had an interesting time perusing the menu for a selection.  I ordered 2 things.  I ordered El Plato Tipico and   Ensalada (not a salad, but a fruit drink with fruit in it.).    I especially enjoyed the flavors of the Ensalada.  It was surprisingly delicious and sweet. I don't usually care for sweet drinks; however, this drink was refershing and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  The chunks of fruit was nice too, but caused a bit of a challenge when I attempted to drink from the straw.  One of the things I love about South American restaurants is that there is always some type of \"typical meal\".  At a Colombian restaurant, you order the Bandeja Paisa.  At a Guanaquito, you order \"El Plato Tipico\".   This dish comes with an array of things that allow you to sample some of the simpler offerings.  My favorite part of the meal had to be the cheese and meat pupusa,  This is quite similar to the Indian paratha in style, not in taste.... A pancake stuffed with goodies.  The pupusa was so tender and moist with the appropriate amount of cheese and the hints of meat.  I savored every bite of those.  I also enjoyed the tamales.  Their tamales are wrapped in banana leaves and was the most moist and tasty masa I have had in ages.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken, I wish I'd gotten a pepper or veggie tamale, but ... still very tasty.  Return Factor 100%."}
