{"text":"I love there fish fry , the breading is perfect . Good beers and great service. Plenty of tv's to watch and they even have the Bubble Hockey! Love it!"}
{"text":"Serves its purpose in catering to mid-20s dudes and guys who wear baseball caps. The occasional belch and waft of stale cigarette odor notwithstanding, not a bad place to catch a game. Otherwise, completely unremarkable."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  The food was delicious and Tony, the owner, was so friendly and welcoming!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic bar!  Great food, a great environment, great beer selection, enough tvs to watch any sports-game that suits your fancy.  Every time I go back I find extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful staff.  They have darts, pool, and shuffleboard if you get bored, but it's all away from the tables so it's not a distraction or an irritation.  The open-floor layout is pretty unique too!  And to top everything off, they have UW Band Alumni come play during Badger games!  How cool is that?!?!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never been impressed by the staff, drinks, or food. The bartender turnover is crazy and the management tries to cover for the lack of talent but falls short every time. The food is terrible as well and none of the recipes are good even though the owner praises the cooks. Be prepared for cold cheese curds and over cooked burgers."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers you can get in sun prairie, it has a great flavor from the sauce they put in the meat. The owner is very knowledgeable and you can tell he has a true passion and takes pride in the meals he makes. I was very happy with my experience there."}
{"text":"Stopped in, encouraged by an earlier review that said vegetarians would have difficulty finding food.  Burgers were cooked just right, service was efficient and pleasant.  4p in the afternoon the drunks yelling a lot of what kept The Varsity from 5 stars, not really the establishments fault, but it's a consideration.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The food's good (not great, but good)--I had a BLT. Whole wheat toast was nice and thick, and they didn't skimp on the lettuce or the bacon.  I got the chicken dumpling soup as a side (no extra charge). $6.75 for a meal that really filled me up.  The real reason to come here is the happy hour: $1 off drinks doesn't sound too impressive until you realize the regular price of drinks is $3.  So yeah--$2 per mixed drink is fantastic. There are darts and shuffleboard... booths or table seating... and on Thursday nights, karaoke (which I was dismayed at but ended up LOVING the DJ and having way more fun than I thought I would). They accommodated our group of 22 with no problem (friend's goodbye party), and the staff were extremely attentive and fast with orders. Bathroom was nice and clean, too--that makes all the difference to me.  There's a whole lot of space here, and lots of seating options. Great off-street parking, too.  I'll definitely be spending more time here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 because it's hard for a vegetarian to find food here but the karaoke is great!  Pretty much your only option is a salad sans meat or a grilled cheese sandwich.  They have Flatbread pizza but none without meat.  I know, I know. Most bars don't cater towards vegetarians but, come on at least offer a cheese pizza!  It's a dive bar but relatively clean.  Service can be slooooow though.  Bathrooms are clean and well maintained and they have an ample parking lot.  Several TVs are scattered around including 2 large ones up front so I imagine game days here are popular.  The drinks are fine...nothing too special but that's not really why one comes to a dive bar, is it?  I can see this as a place for regulars.  Since I live a good half hour or more away I'll never be a regular but  I'll come here occasionally, especially if I'm on the east side with friends."}
{"text":"Great, fast service.  The food was exactly what we wanted after the Badger game.  The burgers are made by hand (not pre-made patties) and the ability to upgrade to a pretzel bun was a bonus for me!  Plenty of tvs to catch the game on as well and a full bar."}
{"text":"A friend raved about this sports bar and talked me into checking it out and I'm glad I did.   We stopped in for Saint Patrick's day and they had a great deal on green beer (you could also get it un-dyed) They had plenty of TVs for those who follow March Madness and once the game was over they kicked off Thursday night karaoke. What a hoot!   We went back on a Saturday night for some more karaoke and great drink prices. $3 a rail mixers and $1.50 cans of Hamm's.   The staff is always friendly and quick to fill your glass which even when they are busy. They have great specials daily that we will be going back for.   Can't wait to go back to see what kind of shenanigans I can get into during Packer and Badger games.   P.S. For some reason the nachos were not placed under the broiler. Leaves you with sloppy cheese all over the place. Not a big deal I just won't order them again."}
{"text":"Came here after fireworks on the Fourth of July, and it was the only place with an open kitchen for miles, so we were very appreciative to have found it. The food is your standard bar grub, so if that's your thing dig in. I had the Varsity Burger with the daily soup, tomato bisque. Both are awesome! Be sure to order your burger with the veggie fixings like lettuce, tomato, and onion. The best part about the restaurant is atmosphere: it's very clean and fun if you're into karaoke and sports bars. More importantly, customer service is on point. I could tell by reading the other reviews that the owner was the one serving us. The other reviews are all accurate, Tony is an incredibly nice guy. He made sure we had everything we needed, and even went out of his way to turn the music down on the side of the restaurant my family was eating at, all without having being asked. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in WI, and will tell my family and friends."}
{"text":"This place was great! Tony is the nicest person in the world, and the varsity burger is great. Highly recommended if you're looking for some good late night eats. Also, if you spend over $50, you get a chance to spin the wheel for a prize! I won a free pitcher of beer!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! My opinion of the food and atmosphere may be a bit biased due to the fact that I know the owner of the establishment. But it is a very good place to grab a burger and just relax with friends. Another thing to note about me is that I am still a youngin at 22. However, having said that, I just visited last week with my aunt who is roughly 3x my age and she enjoyed their food as well.  Overall though I have nothing but an absolutely stellar rating for this bar and eatery."}
{"text":"Meh. Wasn't impressed.   Went in Friday for their Friday Fish Fry. The clam chowder was ok, the chili looked much better. Ordered the pretzels and cheese, probably the best thing we ordered. Mini soft pretzels served piping hot with a pretty decent cheese dip. I made the mistake of going with the baked cod for my main course. It was tough and tasted like nothing. The BF got the fried cod which was much better but still nothing amazing. French fries were pretty good. BF ordered a drink with Sprite and it came Coke. Or really dark Sprite? Lame.   The atmosphere was probably the worst part about this place.One of the bartenders, the only female working at the time, seemed pretty great. The others seemed to kind of hate their jobs. One of the speakers behind us was shot - it sounded like a kazoo was playing. It was very loud, and very bright inside the large bar/restaurant. Just not really what I was expecting I guess.  In general, I didn't enjoy very much at all about my visit here. There seemed to be several \"regulars\" so that's good I suppose. They can keep this place all to themselves.  Oh and one last thing - they didn't use ice scoops. They just shove the cups into the ice, which is gross."}
