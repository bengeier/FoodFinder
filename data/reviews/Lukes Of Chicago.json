{"text":"From the reviews it looks like I hit Luke's on a bad night. The food was decent, but I think it might've tasted better if the prices weren't so high. The employees were friendly enough, but they were more concerned with joking around than they were with making food and getting it out in a timely and efficient manner. (The customers who arrived shortly after us ordered the same menu items we did yet they received their food a good five minutes before us.)   When we arrived at 5pm on a Saturday the place was empty but the front dining room wasn't clean and the drink area was a mess and not properly stocked with drink lids & straws. I think I've said this in previous reviews, but dirty tables are a huge turn off to me. I can understand if the restaurant is slammed and tables are dirty because people are getting up and other people have to grab tables immediately, but this obviously wasn't the case.   Oh and make sure you read the whole menu on the wall, because they have items that aren't listed on their website and on the paper menu that is floating around on the counter."}
{"text":"I noticed the old the greek spot that used to be here had been replaced so being that i lived down the street and drive by this place almost everyday i had to try it out. Format of the store was almost exactly the same as before which is perfect. Plenty of seating, chicago themed of course, a nice TV and nice people working.  Also have to give props to the RC Cola Machine.  As a first timer i was suggested to try the house special, Italian Beef so i figure why not. This unfortunately does not come with fries so i ordered garlic parmesan fries for a side (around $3).  I don't normally order this but i must say it was pretty good. they give you a pretty good portion of meat and peppers but the only thing that bothered me was how soggy the bread got from the juices. this may be appealing to others but to me it was a little too messy. the crinkle fries were served perfectly and were dusted with their garlic parmesan powder which was very delicious (will order every time).  Of course i was with my GF and she ordered the Italian sausage. i had a few bites and it was also very good. nice size but also had the soggy bun from the juices.  All in all it was a pleasant experience.  I will for sure be coming back to try more items.  Next time perhaps it will be the double dog or double sausage...  until next time..."}
{"text":"Love, love love Lukes.  I'm a big fan of the original downtown.  The Scottsdale location is good, but not as good as the original - although it has gotten better and closer in quality as time goes on.  I feel like places like these need to be open for awhile to let the grease cook up and \"season\"  the grills and equipment a bit before the quality can match the original places.  The first time I tried the Scottsdale location, it was mediocre.  I tried it again 6-7 months later, and it was worlds better.  This did NOT apply to the Lukes in Chandler.  The quality, in my opinion was *every* bit as good as the original downtown (my wife didn't fully agree, but did admit it was close).  Not to mention, the Chandler location is big, open, airy...it's new, it's clean...and not too many people realize that it's there yet.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a couple other people there.  I can't imagine that will continue forever, but we enjoyed the less-hectic nature of it for now.  The beef and sausage combo with sweet peppers and grilled onions, with provolone...is my absolute favorite.  It is a messy, sloppy, greasy, delicious combination.  Love the ore-idea crinkle cut fries as well.    If you're a fan of the original...you will not be disappointed with this one."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. I have had most of the menu and never been disappointed. The Italian Beef is the best in the AZ. The Italian Beef and sausage is a fat man's dream. One tip I have is ask for your fries to be made extra crispy. I will be back as much as possible."}
{"text":"The Italian beef sandwich is my new favorite there.  The sandwich is messy since it is dunked in it's broth/gravy/aus ju.  The taste is different than Al's Beef in Scottsdale, but I love both places.  The meat is spicier than Al's, but has it's own great taste.  I am glad I do have to drive too far to get a great tasting Italian beef sandwich.   The only knock is that they do not take Amex, only Visa/MC, or cash, so I do not get the points on the card."}
{"text":"Luke's is fantastic!  I have eaten at several places like Luke's over the years, so I was happy to see this open up as I live nearby.  The decor is simple, but nice (great HD TV).  The workers were friendly and funny.  Most important, the food was great.  I will become a regular here, you can count on it.  Try the bratwurst...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome. Nice little taste of home. I tried their italian sausage and was thoroughly impressed. And the fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Ate there tonite after a friend raved about the sandwich's.  Upon arriving the man at the counter had his back to the door adjusting channels on the TV with a remote.  He could no be bothered to turn around ad greet us until he was done choosing a channel he liked.  Ordered the Italian Beef sandwich with everything on it.. Meh, it was just OK, had to add some hot sauce so it had some flavor.  Had the Parmesan fries as well... they were good if you added Ketchup. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and will definitely keep coming back. Great hot dogs and especially love the chili dog.  Another thing that is really good is their italian sausage, eggs and peppers sandwich.  Very good food and service and love that it is in the east valley."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lukes since my family (who is from Chicago) and I moved to Arizona, which was 18 years ago.  The usual location we go to is the original Phoenix location, and I actually live by the Scottsdale location, but I was in Chandler with my boyfriend and we saw this location so that's why I'm reviewing this one. I can NEVER pass a Lukes without getting a hot dog. These are the real Chicago deal everyone. I always order mine with everything on it, I mean if you're going to a Chicago style restauarant why would you order it any other way? Everything is always immaculate. You've got the neon green relish, the savory vienna beef dog mustard, onion, a pickle, and of course to top it all off the sport peppers and the garlic salt. The fries that accompany your hot dog are top knotch, I love the golden brown ones. (I am sitting here, drooling,just imagining how good my hot dog/fries were and it's only 9 am.)  I have never tried anything else from Lukes, but my mom has tried and loved the Italian Beef.. I can just never stray from those damn hot dogs. I also dont understand how people can think this place is pricey, I paid about $11 for my boyfriend and I to both get a hot dog and a drink. And my advice: Go for lunch and order 2 (or 3 if you're hungry!) I usually eat 1 right then for lunch, and save the other for dinner.. they are delicious reheated."}
{"text":"Their Italian beef was okay, would I go there again, most likely not so that is why the two stars. The beef was too thinly sliced because after the mixing and dipping, it felt like it was grated like the philly cheese steaks which I don't care for. I lived in Chicago for 8 years and in their italian beef sandwiches, you can feel the slices and see it, here I just saw a pile of beef. Bread was okay, seem standard. They charge .65 for giardiniera which was usually standard with these sandwiches in Chicago. The giardiniera was full of just jalapenos and small pieces of carrots and others. Good giardiniera has big pieces of cauliflower, carrots, celery, peppers, onions and they use to pile it on. Here you get like a little tiny cup. Anyway, I guess I can't compare here and Chicago and likely won't find a place comparable, but it still below average italian beef and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Finding an Italian beef sandwich in the desert was a special day for me.  Unfortunately, Lukes does not measure up.  Having spent many wonderful lunches at Portillos in Chicago, the bar is high.  Lukes beef was average, gardinera was simply jalapenos, not the real thing, the portion was small and way too greasy.  At $6.65 it is $1.50 more than the real one in Chicago and the grease soaked the roll so fast it fell through before i started to eat it.  So, a not so clean restaurant, soggy greasy food and high prices makes me continue the search...I won't return here !"}
{"text":"I was in the area and couldn't decide what to eat. So the mom and pop your of neighborhood place gained my vote.  I had the meatball sub with fries.  It was pretty decent and the price was ok. Not a bargain but ok.  The food was average although the bread had butter which was kind of awkward. I mean, isn't there enough fat in the cheese and meatballs? (Plus the fries)  Anyways, is you're in the neighborhood and want to support local business, this is your place.  Just don't expect to have cravings of the food once in a while.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Just went to Luke's for the first time today and not disappointed at all.  Being from the Chicagoland area I have a great love for the Vienna beef hotdog which they serve at Luke's.  I order the chili cheese dog which came with crinkle cut fries and I got a side of cheese for them.  The chili dog was delicious and made me realize how much I've missed Vienna beef!  The cheese they put on the hotdog was shredded cheddar, not the liquid cheese you get for the fries, which was also very good.    My boyfriend went with their combo, Italian beef with a sausage.  He demolished the sandwich which ended up being much larger than he anticipated.  He said the giardiniera tasted fresh and wasn't oily as some tend to be.  He thought it was interesting and really enjoyed it saying it gave it a good flavor.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed eating regularly at the Luke's in Tucson so when I discovered this Luke's while visiting in Chandler several months ago, I was thrilled...until I got my food home.  The Italian beef was shredded scraps of meat that was so small and thin that it should have been tossed out.  The French fries which I believe Luke's has always been known for as being incredible, were unfortunately soft and mushy.  Their food is not cheap.  Everything is extra...Several months ago I wrote an email to Luke's complaining about my poor experience and to this day still have not received a response.  Had I not done takeout, my sandwich and fries would have been left on the counter instead of in my trash.  I can appreciate that sometimes a restaurant will have a quality problem but not responding to a complaint is unforgivable."}
{"text":"been back twice and had a burger and a dog,  Both were good.   3-stars means A-Ok and I think that fits the place."}
{"text":"I had one of their Italian beef sandwiches on 3/8/13 with two co-workers who ordered the same sandwich and two hours later we all had similar intestinal problems. No extra charge for the colon cleanse."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service sucks. Took close to 10mins to take our order, (nobody in front of us) not even acknowledgement that we were waiting. Forgot our drinks."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a good hotdog this is the place to go. Always friendly staff and consistently great food. Slightly expensive for what it is but totally worth it. Thanks Luke's!"}
{"text":"Went their for dinner on Monday night, ordered the combo sausage sandwich and other person ordered prime rib sandwich with cheese fries and two small drinks..total over $26.00, the green pepper on my sandwich was god aweful..it was not even cut up..just 3 big pieces on it, the roll was stale on both sandwiches...they ran out of cheese sauce and just put Cheddar cheese on it...the prime rib was way over cooked..just all around bad.i would rank Burger King better than this place...Steve in Chandler"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, and the fact that I LOVE italian beef sandwiches, I've been on the hunt for something worthy since I moved to Arizona about a year ago.  This is the best beef sandwich place in the East Valley, hands down.  I prefer to order my beef \"dry, with extra cheese, a side of beef juice, and a side of hot peppers\".  This way the bread isn't too soggy, and you can dip the sandwich as much, or as little, as you want.    Their chili cheese dog is also very excellent(they actually started selling their chili by the bowl last week and my girlfriend loves it).  The chili dog comes with fries, and I order a side of cheese to dip mine into.  I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!  It's also a very clean atmosphere, with Chicago memorabilia throughout(plenty of Cubs stuff, but lacking ANY Sox stuff...I almost docked this place a star because of that)."}
{"text":"it was just ok nothing spectacular. had the chicago dog, the bun fell apart on me. the price for that and the fries were not bad at all. they do sell the chicago relish and sport peppers there so when i run out of mine i know where to go get them."}
{"text":"Simply ok. Their Italian Beef isn't bad but its not great either. Had more flavors than Lobbys but their hot peppers are weird (there is cucumber in the mixture?!?) and the bread does not hold up to the jus. I ordered an Italian beef not dipped, yet the bread was super soggy from just the meat jus. Additionally, I like grilled onion on my Italian Beef and that was not even an option on the menu. Even though i think Taylor Street is better, I would come here again because its closer and the hubby says he doesn't mind it."}
{"text":"Todd H. - I'm with you on this one.  My semi-annual trips to Chicago require a trip to Portillos where I order 1 beef sandwich w/hot AND sweet pappers, 1 tamale, 1 Chicago style hot dog and an order of onion rings.  No, I don't eat them all, but I have a bite of each!  Luke's beef sandwich isn't exactly Portillos and you may have put your finger on it with the bread.  And what they put on the beef sandwiches is not giardiniere - close, but not quite.  I think they think people in AZ don't know what giardiniere is and are afraid to use it.   I do like Luke's better than Al's and it is as close as Arizona is going to get to Portillos.  If you can't make it to Illinois for Portillos, there are a couple of them in and near Buena Park, CA.  I have been tempted to take a road trip over there - it's that good.  But back to Luke's - the fries are great, the hot dogs are great and the tamales are good."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm pretty sure this place is closed. Not just closed but no longer in business. I drove by recently and saw the signs in the window \"For Lease\". Based on my last experience at Luke's, I know why. I've been to Luke's many times before and always had solid food. The customer service is minimal at best but nothing bad to report per say. I raved and raved about this place to my boyfriend and so we finally stopped by one night. He ordered the Italian beef and it was literally the driest meat I've ever seen/tasted. It did not appear the meat had been soaked in anything and the sandwich was so dry! I was so disappointed he got this sandwich because I've tried their Italian beefs before and they were good. I don't know if they stopped caring because they know they were going to close down or if they forgot to soak the meat. So, I now have a different opinion of Luke's, especially since Portillo's are popping up nearby."}
{"text":"was just in there ....tried to charge me 13 dollars for a hot dog and chili cheese fries ...walked out...use the go all the time ....the manager was really rude ....I will be calling the owner ....never going back ...LUKES you have lost my business forever"}
{"text":"What a surprising treat! I had seen a good restaurant come and go in this location so in an effort to support the newcomer, my girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch on a whim.  From the moment we stepped in the experience was terrific. To begin with, the cashier immediately greeted us and, finding we were new, recommended (with all apparent sincerity and business sense) the beef & sausage combo sandwich.   They have a sweet or spicy option for peppers and as we couldn't decide the owner approached to help ensure everything flowed smoothly, suggesting we could have the spicy peppers on the side.  The sandwich and fries we ordered easily fed both of us and the quality of the meat was incredible. Authentic rich flavors perfectly complimented one another and we found ourselves drenching the sandwich in the wonderful and authentic Chicago pepper dressing.   The restrooms and restaurant were clean and pleasant - everything top notch."}
{"text":"Italian Beef sandwich is AMAZING!  I dream about it!"}
{"text":"Been to the Luke's in Chandler at least 6 times since they opened, including the first day....and they have only been open a short time :)...So I can say I am a fan of the place for sure. They know it too!!   It used to be Daphne's Greek restaurant and one day I noticed it was Luke's and we decided to try it.  I just got back from a trip to Chicago and cannot find anything like the Chicago style hotdogs that they have in Chicago....except for Luke's. I can say they are pretty spot-on from the 2 places I had dogs while on my trip. One of them was O'Hare airport and I don't recommend ordering a dog from there...yuck!!  Ok, so back to Luke's, MMMMMM....also had the zucchini (which they always yell back to the cooks), garlic and parm fries, a double dog, and the dipped italian beef...and NO I didn't order all of this at once.   As for the Italian Beef, I HAD to try that after watching some episode of Man Vs. Food and he was enjoying it so much.....I promptly went down to Luke's (which is totally conveniently located by me), and ordered some. I liked it soggy...could have even been soggier for my taste but it was good. Peppers were HOT so I was glad I had ordered them on the side. What can I say, I am a gringa!!   Staff is always friendly and I always talk to the owner when I am in there.  Recommended for anyone who wants a Chicago experience here in AZ. The only reason I am not eating at Luke's every week is because I am trying to eat healthy.....trying :)"}
{"text":"Once I saw that I could get a Lukes of Chicago Italian beef right up the street it was a must stop spot. Walking in it smelled really good tons of choices on the menu. I stepped up to the counter to order the guy seemed less than happy to be there at this time. I ordered the Italian beef and sausage combo with the hot giardiniera with an order of fries. The bread was really fresh and the sandwich was so good even the fries were good and I am not a fan of crinkle cut fries. So if you want a great Italian beef this is the place come hungry it's filling."}
{"text":"I am a Philly Cheese Steak snob and Lukes just blows me away. The best beef sandwich in town! Beef sandwich, sweet peppers, provolone... Mmmmmm. The sandwich is dripping wet! Just writing this makes me crave it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The italian beef sammy is awesome!! Along with the onion rings.  My one dislike was that they tables are in desperate need of refinishing, as they are kind of gummy feeling."}
{"text":"For those craving Chicago style eats, Luke's is a decent option for Italian beef and Chicago dogs. We ate here for lunch and I had the junior beef with chili cheese fries. I also tried some of the Chicago dog.   The junior beef was a pretty hefty portion of meat and bread. The sandwiches come with just meat, and if you want provolone, hot, or sweet peppers it will be $.60 extra per topping. I opted to have it with hot and sweet peppers, but I think the provolone would have helped the sandwich taste even better.  The bread was good. It had a crusty, yet chewy quality, which held up to the juices and broth from the beef. The beef was tender, and a generous heaping, but I would have liked some more flavor in the broth to bring an even greater dimension to the sandwich. The sandwich seemed like it was dipped half-way, since one side was juicy while the other was dry. I would have liked the sandwich to be dipped more so that it was uniformly soaked in rich brothy goodness.   Compared to another Italian beef I've had in the Phoenix area at Lobby's in Tempe, while the portions are bigger at Lukes, I like the taste of the sandwich better at Lobby's as a whole.   I liked the Chicago dog better than the Italian beef. It had all the right condiments, right down to the peppers and poppy seed bun. The hot dog itself was cooked just right, with a lot of flavor. In Chicago dog-dom, I crown Luke's the winner vs. Lobby's version.  Since we were on a limited time schedule for lunch, we appreciated the lightning quick service as our meals were ready as soon as we filled up our soda drink and sat down. One thing to also note is that the free range soda fountain has RC products, and Hires root beer (I didn't even know they still made that root beer!)"}
{"text":"What can I say about Luke's other than its amazing. Don't come here if you're on a diet but the Italian beef is amazing and the fries are delish!!!!"}
{"text":"So I'm not from Chicago, but this place makes me wish I was, except for the fact I hate the Bears and Cubs.   The Italian beef sandwiches are good, but the Italian beef and sausage combo is the sandwich that is taking years off my life. The thing is huge and so damn good. Get it with the hot peppers/giardiniera. I almost never have room, but the fries here are the crinkle cut type that remind you of the ones your mom used to make, except these ones are good, fried to perfection. The Chicago dogs are great too, they have the right buns, relish, sport peppers and of course the Vienna Beef dogs.   The one thing I wish these guys had was beer. Nothing washes down an artery clogging meal like a nice cold beer. I mean, you're not going there to get healthy, so why not? I'm sure as hell not going to wash that sandwich down with a diet coke, that's just not an option."}
{"text":"great spot for some good Chicago grub... Italian beef with cheese is what I come for ajus sauce always on the side and must have the jardiniere pickle also put on side.. Love the Fried zucchini.."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same good old greasy food as their original place on Indian School in Phoenix although with smaller sandwich portion size.  Don't go if you have a tender stomach, this heaven on earth is for grease food junkies."}
{"text":"been past this place a few times and i usually go to the subway a few doors down.  i  not sure if a rude cashier is suppose to be part of the chicago experience or not but that's what i encountered.  everything is separate and additional.  i asked if they had a combo deal with the sandwiches and they guy looked at me like i had 3 eye balls.  i ordered a italian beef sandwich, (no extras) and it was $7.50.  for $7.50 i got meat on a bun.  i eat it at home and it tasted just \"OK\" but after about 20 minutes, i honestly spent the rest of the afternoon on the toilet.  wont be back."}
{"text":"My dad used to take me to the one in Tucson when I was little and I LOVED it. When I moved to Phx I looked for one and was so bummed that there weren't any. And then it opened right down the street from me! Good quality beef, not that fatty crap that some places serve. I like their hot italian beef sandwich with extra hot peppers! So good and so filling. One of those is like breakfast, lunch and dinner for me. It's family-owned, too! I think it's operated by the guy's grandchildren or something. So happy there's one in Chandler now!"}
{"text":"i was first introduced to luke's in Tucson on grant road..many years ago.  awwhhh...good memories of that lukes.  monday we discovered that a brand new one opened in chandler...we had to try it!  we both had the italian beef sandwich with fries of course.  i requested my peppers on the side. oh man the beef was better than when i remember..juicy & tender.  it's in the same shopping center as wholes foods next to the boutique.  it's a relaxed atmosphere, friendly service and brand new.  although it was delicious.. i won't be able to frequent this spot because my jeans won't fit :) but definitely worth trying once if you have not."}
{"text":"Lowdown :Really greasy and bad tasting sandwich  Just noticed that Lukes had opened inthe place of the greek restaurant next to paradise bakery. On walking in I noticed that the choice of sanwiches was compact, which was good I had only a few things to choose from, beef, sausage or egg and some combination of these.  Asked for the egg and peppers sanwich. For people conversant in cooking they will know that making good tasting egg requires precision. Sadly this was lacking in the product I got. The egg was overtly salty but the peppers and onions were not seasoned. Any ametuer cook knows that it should always be the opposite. Also by choosing the egg/peppers combo it allowed me to see how greasy the bun was that it came in (never a good sign).   I'm sure all these would have been masked had I gone with the meat offerings. I also agree that the service sucks if not for the son? Josh."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place gets some mad props for A) having vienna beef (the best!), B) Having the neon green relish (why can't I buy this at the store?!?!), and C) RC cola on tap. All very good things. The bad part is that the restaurant itself wasn't the cleanest, all of the tables were dirty and there were very few customers in the shop, and the fries were a little soggy. Overall, this place is good, but it's not the best chicago hot dog place I have been to in phoenix."}
{"text":"Got a polish, chicago style.  YUM!  The sausage casing snapped when I bit in, and it was juicy and flavorful.  YUM!  I've had chi-town dogs from every establishment I can find, and Lukes rates pretty high on my list."}
{"text":"I drive past this place all the time so I decided to finally try it. I was surprised with the menu, it wasn't what I expected but overall it was alright. The service was great and I liked the atmosphere. Nothing spectacular about it though. I tried the turkey sandwich and some fries, which were okay."}
