{"text":"Always a nice stop when out riding the motorcycle. Beer prices are good and has a great small town friendly feel to it. Staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"It was good. Waitress took my order wrong, so had to wait a while to get a new one. She ended up not charging me for it. Drinks were great. Not very kid friendly though. No kids menu or changing tables."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff.  Nice, local vibe. This place is dog friendly.  You can sit & eat with your dog out on the patio & watch the downtown happenings.  They will offer your doggy a bowl of water."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks at a good price. Plenty of entertainment throughout the week and the owners are awesome! Worth the trip from just about anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Super nice waitresses, ice cold drinks in big glasses, and the chicken strips were awesome. Yes, we noticed the ranch dressing was made from scratch. Brilliant! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! The service was quick and friendly. Prices are also very good. I recommend the chicken tenders, burger, or the macaroni and cheese. All were fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Britney never let our drinks be empty. Even on a busy Saturday night!!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place with awesome service but waitstaff changed a few months ago and its gone downhill.  You have to chase down staff to get waited on.  On average whether the place is super busy or super slow you wait at least 10-30 minutes for a server to acknowledge you."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a visit to the Hoover Dam. Service was friendly, kitchen took care of a special request. Very comfortable and inviting place to hang out. Food was very tasty and prices were good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME.. the staff was fun and friendly even if I was with my Patriots fan friend.. they still treated us like old friends.. had a blast watching the game !!! The food was good for a bar ... I'll be back next visit for sure !!!"}
{"text":"We were at Hover Dam and stop here to eat.   The beer was cold and the oriental chicken salad had lots of chicken but missing the basil and cilantro. Price was ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant by far in Boulder City. Great staff, friendly and best food in this great little town!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the horrible service and mediocre food at Boulder dam brewery we found jacks. People there were very nice and the food is worth going back for. We live in lake Las Vegas and plan to make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Nice place a Boulder City. I was here last year and was good. I take this year a feiend to visit and i must to says that chicken wings are REALLY GOOD but i dont liked when i ask to my  Waiter wy my burger are NOT mediym Red, she said litteral I WROTTE MEDIUM RED ON THE NOTE... she do nothing else..
So, i will NOT come again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for bar snacks & drinks. Service was great and the prices are very reasonable. We had cheese curds, potato skins & bacon wrapped jalapeños stuffed with sausage and cream cheese. Jalapeños were amazing and the cheese curds were pretty good too. The potato skins were a little dry....wouldn't order those again.  

Overall pretty solid place for cheap eats & drinks."}
{"text":"slow service, manager is a clown and food is soso."}
{"text":"Nice local place.  Just found by chance.  Ladies Day 1/2  drinks for ladies
. Great n friendly bartender.  Fun to watch the game."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Vegas area regularly  for the past 25 years.  Many times I have taken friends and family to the Hoover Dam.

Well today as luck would have it, I decided to have lunch here in Boulder City Historic District.  I've never been here or even knew this area existed.  BUT here we are... 

Today the weather is about 85 and after walking around we were attracted to Jack's Place.  I think it was the outdoor patio with the 8-10 Longboard u sedan as signage that caught our attention.

The service was fantastic.  THANK YOU SARAH!!!! The food was good. My burger had great flavor but slightly dry.  My wife's Chicken Ceasar salad had great flavor.  The portions were of good size and we will come back on next Hoover Dam Visit.

Had the burger been juicy I would have given a 5.

BTW Thank you agai Sarah for the great service!!!!  

Service is a 10 food is a strong 4."}
{"text":"I loved our lunch at Jacks Place! We sat on the patio and enjoyed the Nevada breeze. Our waitress was not at all like the ones mentioned in the other reviews. I don't remember her name but she had a long pony tail. She was incredibly friendly and treated us well. I had the hamburger, with fries, and my husband has the sausage plate. My hamburger was really nice. You could taste the grill and the sauce was perfect. My husband loved his sausage. Our drinks were refilled ( crazy with how cheap drinks are in NV). We did ask for our check but my husband is impatient. I could have sat their another hour people watching. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"As their exterior signage says, 13 beers on draft and good food! Beers come in 14 and 25oz sizes, good pricing. Menu has an eclectic mix of standard bar apps and burgers/sandwiches plus some interesting entrees like chicken pot pie, drunken clams, mac and cheese, and a sizzling sausage platter- which is what I tried.

Sausage platter comes with three different links (brat, chicken, and Italian) sliced and mixed with peppers and onions, served in a skillet like fajitas- it was executed well, and priced at a crazy-low $12. Pair it with a large draft Pacifico and you're golden.

Several TVs for entertainment, friendly service- oh and a shout out to their Friday night karaoke regulars (7-11PM). I'm not a karaoke fan and when I saw the DJ start setting up, I started looking for another nearby bar to relocate to. But the performers are insanely talented, on par with pros. Dinner, drinks, and a show!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a hike at the lake. nice that they have a full bar. There is outside seating perfect for those of you who travel with dogs. Had the  chicken fingers they are just OK. Friend had the French Dip which look pretty good. The service is Ok waitress was nice enough. All said and done was a good lunch."}
{"text":"Was not happy at all with this place.  Looked like a nice place to grab a quick lunch before heading to the lake.  Outside seating was great with the perfect weather.  That's about all that was good.  It took 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and that was just for the drink order of five sodas.  After another 10 minutes they were back to take our food order.  After another 25 minute wait, we had had enough.  We never got the food, paid for our drinks and left."}
{"text":"I love this place! I ordered the chicken pot pie it was delicious the best I've ever had. My husband ordered the French dip and my friends ordered the Jack's hamburger which they also said it was delicious. I loved there fries and coleslaw. Our server was super nice and friendly. I will definitely come here again. Little cute place like everything in Boulder City."}
{"text":"This would be a five star review if they, 1. used kosher salt on the rim of the margarita glass and 2. used a better variety of onion for their blooming onion.

We decided to leave the kids behind in the hotel room and have a grown-ups only meal within walking distance. This place was full of locals and that's usually a pretty good sign. I think it was an accurate one. 

Our waitress was fantastic, we had confusing drink orders, but she kept up with us. We ordered a blooming onion for the table and it was good, but the fry batter and chipotle sauce were excellent; they would have complimented a slightly sweeter variety of onion much better. A couple of folks had the drunken clams and calamari tacos, and at least four of us had the french dip. Portions were pretty big and everyone was pleased with their food. I had the french dip and fries and it was seriously yummy. It was generously dressed with horseradish and came with a cup of au jus that was just as good on the fries. 

We literally chose this place because of the local crowd spilling out the doors. I'm glad they have good taste."}
{"text":"Wow. Glad we wandered in! We came on Saturday night and had such a good time decided to come back Sun AM for football. 

On Sat we had the bratwurst sandwich and the bacon wrapped jalapeños  - amazing!  Sun we had the best burger ever and fresh chicken fingers.  A place where they actually have fresh food not frozen. 

The servers were very friendly. Britney especially.  

Lots of TVs. Open views and outdoor seating. A+"}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant until my friends and I all got food poisoning after sharing the bacon wrapped jalapenos. I called the restaurant to let them know so they didn't feed that to anyone else. The staff was rude and unsympathetic and the management did not even call me back to apologize. This is not the first time I have heard of food poisoning being an issue as JACKS. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!"}
{"text":"This is an a-ok spot on the main drag of Boulder City. They have live music some nights, which is pleasant. The patio area is heated, which is also nice. It's on the small side. It has lots of local regulars. The staff weren't exactly friendly or attentive. The beer list is meh. The menu has several options, but all were eh. Edible, but not actually good. In sum, come for the vibe and live music - but avoid the food."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because few other places open on New Years Day, and was glad I did.  Wait Staff prompt, friendly, and enthusiastic.  Got our drinks while still checking menu. I opted for smothered chicken sandwich, arrived fast, hot, and delicious. My wife ordered hot dog sandwich, an unusual sandwich, but very good. Side of homemade potato salad also a winner. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great food! No seriously great food. Carnivores, try the sausage skillet. It's a taste of 3 kinds of sausages served fajita style. SIZZLING. The cheese cheese dog is legit. Service is fast and friendly. Not big for a sports bars. It loaded with TV and swivel chairs. Was in BC for 3 days and went to Jacks 3 times."}
{"text":"Typical Boulder City sports bar and dive and there is nothing wrong with that.  Came her after the Boulder City Beerfest and the place was packed which was not surprising but we were still able to walk right in and get a table.  
The menu had a bunch of food but not much that I wanted.  I finally decided on Jack's burger and what I got was a good ol' American burger, nothing more, nothing less.  I was happy with my meal although I think it was a bit on the pricey side.  That being said, service was fast, my order was right, the waitress was kind, and the burger tasted good.  The rest of my group weren't as happy with their choices (chili cheese fries, chicken strips, calamari fries) and although I didn't try them, they did not look the best.  
My friend's parents come here all the time during the week for their specials and atmosphere and although I doubt I will be back, I am glad that I crossed another family owned Boulder City establishment off of my list."}
{"text":"Service is good Except I ordered their medium burger and it was well done. 
Waitress ask how everything was and when I told her she said \"I'm sorry\". 
Not a place that I would recommend"}
{"text":"Good food good price and live music. Great place to meet friends. Good mix of locals and tourists. Indoor and outdoor seating. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Nice little place with shaded sidewalk and indoor tables. Seemed like a local place, not one specifically designed to pull in Hoover Dam tourist trade. 

I ordered Jacks burger and it was perfectly cooked to my request. French fries were great. All other members of my party reported being very happy with their orders. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is ok but I sat and fended off flies my entire damn meal. Makes you wonder what lands on your food when it's being prepared. One or two flies, I get it, but not a damn clan of them! This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great service and food, sitting on sidewalk outside enjoying the warm weather.  This is my go to place on bike rides to Lake Mead."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go. Went with my family for lunch after we visited the hoover dam and it was the best decision we have made. You can sit inside or outside. They have happy hour from 3-6 and live music starting at 6. Potato skin was AMAZING!! Was a big worried at first but it ended up being super good. Definitely the place to go!!! 10/10"}
{"text":"Fun place in a smaller city historic district. There are reasonable prices on food and drinks plus very friendly service. Plus there's a patio,  which is awesome on a day like this!"}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers to Jacks, coming in anywhere from 2-5 times a week for years and we love this place but because they have bands, and reserve 90% of their inside tables on the days and nights they have the bands; we won't will be able to come back here much longer because only friends of the bands or the owner can reserve tables. Quite ridiculous how there are empty tables that are RESERVED but yet we have to sit outside in the heat. We spend quite a bit more than the reserved tables but yet that means nothing.  
It's sad that we have to find another local hangout because of this place is being managed."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! We were well taking care of. The drinks were great and we ran in to some unexpectacted relations. We had a great time"}
{"text":"After the boulder city parade my family and I decided to meet some friends at jacks to eat dinner and good times. We got seated and the waitress kindly got us our drinks. We have 3 kids and our friends have 2. Our husbands left to get pizza and we were chatting with the kids. The kids were playing with the menus and we didn't notice they had fallen to the ground. Then the owner RUDLEY slams the menus on my table and says \" I paid a lot of money for these menus to be played with and left on the ground\". I was in shock not understanding what was going on especially over laminated menus. My family and I came to spend money on drinks and food. The owner has no customer service. He could have made the situation better by acting polite. I will never recommend any one to eat there and spend any money there! On the other hand the waitress was really nice. I have never been so disrespected by an owner of a restaurant for something so silly."}
{"text":"Yummmmm
Love the burgers & fries!
Be sure to stop here!

Gotta stop every time we go to vegas!  

Maybe might make a dent in the menu selection!"}
{"text":"Great spot in the heart of Boulder City. Friendly staff. Good food. Good drinks. The Bloody Mary was great buuuuttttt Johnny Macs in Hendo got it beat. But I love this spot and will be back."}
{"text":"Love going to Jacks place. Service and food is always good...seriously! It's very unique in a small town and when you're there you feel like everyone's family because they are so down to earth friendly."}
{"text":"Worst service .. But  Hey they all have great smiles from my table. I'll just keep sitting here waiting for service it's been 10 mins already and still counting  

At Least the entertainment music is good!!!"}
{"text":"I've read some reviews about the service being bad. If you aren't getting good service it's probably your fault, because the staff here is amazing. Good is good, drinks are dirt cheap and the live music is top notch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service, great vibe and great food! I could see myself retiring in boulder city and going here daily!

The stuffed jalapenos and mac & cheese (add chicken) are phenomenal!!!!

They have live music occasionally, indoor/outdoor seating and the location is perfect!

We will travel from Vegas to Boulder City on occasion just to eat here! Great place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here, and it was great!  Service unbelievable (Thanks Jessica!)  Food was delicious! Staff was quick and Fun!  a great place to eat and drink . . . and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Always love coming here, very friendly staff and customers. Jack always thanks you for visiting...great selection of beers...and the best basket of Chicken Strips and fries you'll ever have!"}
{"text":"Jacks place was recommended to us by a employee at the golf course there in Boulder City, decided to give it a shot. Nice little bar with lots of outside seating. Although we decided to sit inside so we could catch the Monday night football game. Ample amount of nice flat screens to catch a game. Bar was nice with a decent food menu and even some football specials. Bathrooms were immaculate which is a big thing for me. If the bathrooms are a mess you can only imagine the condition of the kitchen!! Food came out timely and was delicious. Or at least I think so... I ate it pretty darn quick after golfing that afternoon. Lolol. We ordered a  BLT wrap, burger and the wings. All of us enjoyed the food. 

   The reason for only 3 stars would be purely do to the service. Our server was definitely less than friendly. Not sure of her name because she never introduced herself but the one with the pink/purple hair. Just little things, she was very brief and short in her interaction with us, didn't include the lemon in my water which I specifically asked for. Also after pre-bussing our table and clearing our baskets, she dropped off the togo box we requested but not the check. So we had to sit and wait for her to come around again to get the tab. Common sense says if you just took our plates, our drinks are empty and you dropped off a Togo container its probably a good point to ask if we are ready for the bill. But unfortunately she scurried away too fast after dropping off the Togo container to even get her attention to ask for the tab. So we just sat there. Waiting. 

   This seems to be a recurring issue in these reviews... sub par service at Jacks. Sounds like it's time for management to organize a team meeting and address the service issues. As someone who works in the service industry myself we still left her a 20% tip as I believe in good karma. As far as Jody D's comment saying if we got bad service it's probably the customers fault well that sweetie is just asinine and disrespectful. Judging by the number of her check ins there at Jacks I'm guessing she's either a employee or friend of one. Get a life Jody. 

Not saying you should avoid this place as the food and atmosphere was good! However, as far as the service is concerned don't say you haven't been warned."}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch/early dinner on a sunny warm Saturday afternoon. Comfy outdoor space was perfect for us since we had our pup Laci with us. Cheryl was our waitress and she was attentive, friendly, and prompt but not pushy. We had a nice relaxing meal. Hubs had the Drunken Clams - said they were really really good. I had a really good juicy burger and fries. Sometimes it is the little things that make the big difference. And in this case it was the chicken breast I had initially ordered for my pup Laci. Cheryl came back to our table and said she had talked to the cook and found out that the chicken breasts are all marinated in herbs, spices and pineapple juice. She recommended a plain burger patty as they were not seasoned before being grilled and the cook would make sure nothing was added to Laci's lunch. How very thoughtful of her to check and then let us know there was a better choice for our fur baby. Most restaurants would not \"care\". 
Kudos to Jack's and a shout out to Cheryl for a lovely lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Nice place for sport watching. Food is not sophisticated but is tasty. Friendly service. Not expensive"}
{"text":"Great Burgers, attentive staff in new venue formerly Tony's Pizza. New energy and direction for this great location !"}
{"text":"I don't even know how to begin to describe this place. It was a Saturday night with live music, and I felt like I was at a family wedding... in the best possible way! The locals clearly hang out here and know each other. The band, Stef n Rock, was fantastic and played a really fun range of classic rock and pop (everything from Del Shannon to Elvis to George Thorogood to Heart)! I got pulled onto the dance floor by a group of folks older than my parents, and they were so fun! Great price on beers! We only had potato skins to eat so can't speak too much to the food. They were good - nothing crazy, just standard, tasty pub fare. But the vibe and energy of this place was what it was really about!"}
{"text":"I was not pleased with Jacks Place whatsoever. My boyfriend and I were in the town and decided to try something new. We were completely ignored the moment we walked in the door. Another table had to tell us that we could sit anywhere. We ordered chicken wings and a blooming onion. The blooming onion was good, nothing spectacular, and the wings were just ordinary.

Got refills on our waters one time, after the water had been empty since before we got our food. We felt completely isolated in the middle of the restaurant with little to no service. I would not recommend this place, unless you too want to be forgotten."}
{"text":"Great drink prices, variety of beers on draft and extremely friendly staff. The Bloody Mary is my favorite. For food the chili cheese fries are like none you've ever had and the wings are the perfect amount of crispiness"}
{"text":"I love Jack's. The decor, the menu, the staff, the cold drinks and the patio. 

The wedge salad. The French dip. The specials are always great. Fries are fantastic. 

Live music at 6pm generally a couple nights a week. 

Always a great experience at Jack's Place!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry that i got bad service Jody D , i think its because i'm not a local and white trash. My girlfriend goes outside to talk to her sister and comes back and sits at her table. A woman comes, cleans out her food while she was still eating and the owner/manager rips up her bill in front of her and tells her to leave with no reason. 
  The employees here have no people skills and should not be running a restaurant. We are from D.C. and live in Vegas now and i tell her be careful where you go these people still inbreed. Jacks Place sucks , dont ever go there whomever you are."}
{"text":"Greasy Food; High Prices ; Bad Attitude's:
Stay away from this place especially if there is a man named Mark in charge of the restaurant that day. When Mark is acting manager all the waitresses will be in a sour mood & if you complain to him he will be very adamant to let you know that He is the Head cook and some way making it like a threat that something may be done to your food. I've even seen him kick veterans out for no good reason at all. I will not even tell my enemies to go eat or drink there.
Be where you have been warned"}
{"text":"Jacks place is one of our new fav places to eat. I always get the smothered chicken sandwich and its delish. Bacon wrapped jalapeños are really good too. The menu is simple but good. Prices on food are reasonable, wine is over priced for the brand and lack of selection but the friendly girls serving us make up for that so it's all good."}
{"text":"Don't come after 8- \"sorry, we stopped serving.\" Asked until what time they serve dinner, \"until it gets slow.\" Seems a bad policy left to the whim of a temperamental staff.
Why not have an open close policy?"}
{"text":"This is the neighborhood place we all want and need. Not for food snobs or blowhards. Good solid menu that is limited to the type of stuff you want when your with friends or just looking to chill. If you want gourmet, go to Vegas. If it's on the menu it's solid for what it is - pub chow done well. Service is always good to great (don't listen to other reviews that say otherwise). Good drinks that are cheap by Vegas standards. Our favs for food - quesadilla with chicken, chicken pot pie, hot dog sandwich (yes - split in two on a great hoagie roll), and burger. Crowd is eclectic with tourists, local work folk, local motorcycle folk, local weirdos, etc. Lots of TVs to catch sports."}
{"text":"Four stars for the nice variety of on-tap beers and a 25 oz option.  British hubby very happy indeed.  We were in for Saturday lunch during NASCAR and there appeared to be only two waitresses and one bartender.  Maybe a third waitress at some point...there was one with whose family dropped in and God bless family, etc. but if you're in the food biz trying to make money, you want tables fed and out the door, or steady drinkers getting their refills pronto.  Instead hubby's second pint took so long he wondered if they were brewing his Fat Tire on site.  That's a death knell to the 20% tip no matter how friendly you are.

As far as my food allergies, I asked the waitress to write \"no butter\" no less than three times before she opted to go ahead and write the damn thing down.  Call me obsessive, but I'm the one who pays in bodily anguish when the chef gets it wrong.

The burgers we had were large as advertised and I'm sure they were angus beef.  I just didn't notice any special flavor.  This would have kicked this place down to a 3-star max if it weren't for the previously mentioned beer and subsequently happy husband."}
{"text":"My friend and me stopped in for a late afternoon ball game and meal. I ordered the fish and chips. DELICIOUS!  Will return very soon.
The food and serving was above par."}
{"text":"I love boulder city and hope to someday end up in this awesome cute oldfashioned town.. this bar is in the main street of Boulder were some other little shops are.. the service here is awesome.. great waitress. Really attended and friendly.. drinks good priced and without having to ask your free coke refill is already on the table.. lots of locals at this bar who enjoy to get together and watch sports."}
{"text":"great burger! says my husband!  And a band on Tuesday night was fun."}
{"text":"I love this bar!!! Karaoke with Bill on Friday nights is AWESOME!!!! So much fun. Food is spectacular and the staff is pretty awesome!!! Our Favorite server is Brandy. But, they're all amazing! This place doesn't disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I usually eat at the pizza place nearby but was on a date and decided to try something less greasy. We ordered the pot pie and the garlic sauce clams and we were not dissapointed. The service was okay and for the price paid, the food was great. Plus the seating outdoors is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Great little place for some awesome chicken tenders. Well worth the price. If you go with the burger, I'd recommend the pepper jack."}
{"text":"This is our second time here.  We are traveling from Las Vegas and came here to watch the playoff games and have great wings and burgers.  We came early to get a seat and they actually let us in before opening.  I'm not sure how many businesses would let people in early but they did and they showed great customer service last time we were here too.    We had the wings, chili cheese fries and today trying the crab bisque soup.    Highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Jacks place. My girlfriends from the salon like kareoke night. 
The mac and cheese eas delightful. The potatoes skins looked good as well.  
I just had soda and they kept it full.  Good service too."}
{"text":"Jack's Place is a great little hidden gem in Boulder City. It is run by awesome people and has a fun mix of relaxed locals and sometimes exploring tourists find their way in as well. The food is standard bar fare. The establishment is clean and comfortable. They have great live music most evenings. Just a great atmosphere all together."}
{"text":"Awesome place! This afternoon, we had the jalapeño poppers on the patio while listening to some light live music. My gal and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5-4 star place.  Clean, well lighted, friendly staff and a middle-aged to old crowd.   I fit right in. . OK, maybe not yet -- but almost.  Everyone seemed to know everyone, calling out \"Happy Birthday ___(dude's name I don't remember)__\".   I kept to myself which was fine, I was studying and it wasn't too lively.  

I had the French dip which was AWESOME.  The fries were perfect as well.  But, alas the ranch dressing was bottled and sucked...I am a Pittsburgh girl at heart (California Native, Pittsburgh Yinzer by training). I judge a place by clean bathrooms and great ranch.  This place was so close...

All in $11 plus a $4 tip because the girl was so cool.  Although she steered me wrong on the ranch dressing.  She has presumably never been to the Midwest where they grow their girls big, fattened up on rivers of awesome ranch and french fries"}
{"text":"One of our go-to places. Always friendly staff. Great prices. And food is consistently good. Fish and chips are great; their tartar sauce is great. I am picky about cole slaw and I really like theirs. It is a bit loud, but that's because it's busy! Pacifico on draft and $5.00 cocktails. Winner!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Well worth the drive from Vegas. Good service, Great food and open airy atmosphere. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Always good food and service. Lots of tv's for sports watching. There is usually music at least 3 nights a week and karaoke on Fridays which is good for people watching.  Cleanest place in town."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back from Hoover dam to Vegas. It's an adorable town & will definitely return here. Jack's was great. The food was awesome. Queso appetizer was a home run with our group. The Mac n cheese was a hit (homemade & delicious), calamari tacos were on the money and chicken pot pie had so much chicken in it we were so surprised & it was awesome on top of it! Wait staff is super friendly - so glad we decided to take the scenic route back to Vegas! This little town is a diamond in the rough!!!"}
{"text":"As a college educated chef and aspiring culinary entrepreneur, I can safely say that if this place doesn't change, it is not going to stay open long.

The food was pretty good, but the service was some of the worst I've ever had. One of the servers looked like she had been up for 4 days binging on methamphetamine. Also the theme of the joint is totally confusing. They have all of this beautiful honey colored wood, and surfing stuff, and sports stuff, and the menu doesn't fit any of that. Either be a sports themed bar, or be an island themed bar but please don't be both. Also get a new menu to fit whatever theme you decide on."}
{"text":"I visited Jack's several times during my last visit and it is a great place! It's an instant favorite of mine in Boulder City.

The staff is friendly and nice, both at the bar and at the tables. The place itself is very nice and new, but with a vintage feel and vibe. Everything is clean and nice. The band they have there is great, they play country and rock type stuff, there are often a few people dancing as well. 

The food is really good, and the draft beers are Texas pints, ice cold, and dirt cheap (especially coming from NYC). Stop by Jack's if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Friday karaoke can get really crazy. The place is very friendly and comfortable, and, as a plus, the food is good and not very expensive."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since our first visit and I have to make some additional comments regarding the food.  the hamburger is very good, but some of the fried food is just over fried and I would suggest you stick with the burger or one of the specials.  The rest of my review stands.

Some friends asked us to join them at Jack's to enjoy some country music and so I proceeded to read the Yelp reviews and thought that I would get poor service, expensive and mediocre food.

Well, I was glad to see that some of the reviewers were out to lunch themselves.  The service was great and attentive as my water glass was refilled several times and there was no wait for service. The 1/3# burgers we had were excellent and the fries more than I could eat and the price not more than you would pay at most sit down restaurants.  Most items on the menu are less than $10 bucks so if you think that is expensive, better stick with Mickey D's.

Plan on going back this weekend for some inexpensive food and good music and cold beer.  BTW the band (Seth Turner) was excellent."}
{"text":"Got one beer in over an hour. The table next to us while I had an empty beer for over fifteen minutes, got drinks, ordered and received fries and even their dog finally got water. Twice had to get a different waitress to get our one round of drinks and find her again to get our bill from our waitress. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a very neat place. I mean it's clean, tidy and nice inside. 
Super good server waited on us. 
My salad was great, fresh with homemade croutons and dressing. Refilled my diet promptly. 
All the tables were cleaned quickly. It didn't have the smelly beer smell most bars have. 
They sell their t shirts here too that are good quality. 
My husbands tee is 6 years old and looks new still. 
Jacks also has live music. 
Outdoor seating area is pretty spacious. 
We will stop in again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I had diner there last Sunday   Fun friendly place. Unfortunately we both got really sick from their Fish and Chips. I'll spare you the unpleasant details  .  After 3 days the two of us still have stomach ache (etc...) 
I'll definitely go next door to Milo's next time"}
