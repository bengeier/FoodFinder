{"text":"My wife and I had a late lunch here on 11/05/2016.   Hard to remember a more delicious meal!  Our very friendly and knowledgeable server, Davontre, suggested one of his favorites (short ribs) which my wife thoroughly enjoyed. High compliments to the chef on that one. I had the scallops and substituted the Brussels sprouts for the potato. All very delicious but I think the short ribs with mushroom risotto cake and onion straws were the hands down winner.  Oh yeah, view...great, I guess.  Given a beautiful view and terrific food at a restaurant...I'll take the food, I teyl U what!"}
{"text":"Was seated in the dining room for 20 minutes , never did see a waitress, left and complained the next day, manager called and said our next trip would be better. She took my address , been 3 weeks now. Maybe the HR person quit like are waitress. I WOULD NOT  WASTE THE GAS TO DRIVE THERE AGAIN. Food looks good, but never had a opportunity to try any."}
{"text":"I'm really torn here. the first part of our experience was so bad it was comical. we called for a reservation and the snotty hostess on the phone was, well , snotty. like she was so put off for taking our reservation. we didn't think it a big deal until we arrived and received the the same, well, snotty attitude from not one but two hostesses! Such attitudes! Like we were putting them out for bringing them business! we almost walked out. fortunately our waiter, Skyler, quickly made up for the shitty reception we received. he was awesome. friendly, happy, and everything the bitchy hostesses were not.  the food was great and the service from Skyler was great. and they don't like to seat people on the lower deck overlooking the falls. but just tell the bitchy hostesses that's where you would like to sit, and it should be a great experience. Just make sure they clean the table  BEFORE you sit down. kind of amateur hour."}
{"text":"Great food! Reasonable prices and a really cool location on the Chagrin River. Had the Spicy Crunchy Tuna Rolls, Kale Salad and Filet and all were delicious."}
{"text":"Impressive restaurant! This is a really happening place in Chagrin Falls and should be visited frequently! The food is very unique and the portion size is very satisfying. The atmosphere tends to be a bit on the noisy side but it makes for a New York style bistro. Very cool bar that overlooks the Falls and a great place to relax or entertain out of town guests."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic, romantic evening with my husband for our anniversary. We're not new to the restaurant, as it's one of our local favorites for a good, solid meal.   We love sitting at the bar and eating our meal there as well. It's not on the menu anymore, but my favorite drink is the ginger peach martini made with canton ginger. Ask the bartender and he'll make it up special. A truly fantastic drink.   I would highly recommend the filet. Have ordered it many times and it hasn't disappointed thus far. We indulged in a new entree last night that was a filet medallion with goat cheese and cranberries and a cheese potato side. Outstanding, in my opinion, and very reasonably priced.   I will keep going back to Jekyll's for the food, ambiance and view."}
{"text":"Truffle chips were very good. Trout and small side of mashed potatoes were bland. Potatoes seemed to have been sitting for awhile. Two servers seemed inefficient-isn't that more work for them? Didn't do anything for our service.  Kale and Brussels sprout salad didn't have Brussels sprouts. Tomato pizza was boring. Overall, slow service, slow to be seated with reservation, overpriced, bland, small portions. Great view."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful dinner tonight.....the atmosphere was relaxed sophistication. We were seated with a view overlooking the falls.  Our waiter was very attentive and when our filets came out a bit too overdone for our liking he and the manager insisted upon quickly replacing the meals. The second time around they were perfection. When I am visiting Chagrin Falls again from New York, I will certainly make another reservation at Jekyll's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Our party of 12 was seated promptly in a more private room overlooking the falls. Cocktails before dinner were well-made and tasty.   Entrees that were excellent included the beef short-ribs, filets, halibut and scallops. The wedge and Caesar salads were nicely done as well. The risotto with the scallops was gooey and fairly tasteless - wish we had asked for a replacement.   Since we were such a large group on a Thursday night, our server asked what we were celebrating. It was a 92nd birthday, a wedding, and two anniversaries.  Later, the manager delivered a beautiful tray of three desserts for us to share - a truly surprising and delightful finish to a dinner that all enjoyed.  The menu offers wonderful choices - the service was perfect - we're looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"We went for my sons graduation, and the service was nothing short of excellent. Constantly refreshing our drinks and the manager stopped by to ask how our food was. On top of this, my son was greeted by a \"Congratulations\" card from the staff and a free piece of chocolate cake, compliments of the chef. Great place to celebrate a milestone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food and the atmosphere but sometimes I feel that the customer service could be a bit better. My husband called to make a reservation & was greeted by the rudest hostess (I'm assuming). She said her name was Brianna (spelling?). As my husband was trying to make the reservation she continuously cut him off and was extremely curt. There are so many amazing restaurants & we choose to come here but it's extremely off putting when this is how your experience starts. It starts the moment the reservation is mad. I just wished that the people employed to service customers understood that concept & that they can make or break a customers experience & without customers there is no business. As a former fine dining restaurant manager, I get that there may always be one but this isn't the first time. I am writing this review finally because I would want to know as management. People really can hear you smile over the phone. They can also hear the disdain."}
{"text":"People love this place and the ambiance is nice and the view is nice. The truffle chips were amazing but the rest was just mediocre for what you pay. I'll go back so that's really what matters isn't it?"}
{"text":"One of of our best meals this year.  Jekyll's Kitchen is well worth the 50 minute drive to Chagrin Falls.  The restaurant over looks the falls, Chef Kyle came out to chat about my most excellent pork belly dish, which ranks Top 5 of all time, including Europe.  T's crab cakes were also very, very good.  Of course we skipped desert to head over to Jeni's Chagrin Falls and had killer Ice Cream.  Folks, make a date night and head to Jekyll's, you won't be sorry and your date will love you."}
{"text":"In our anniversary number four we hade the best time at this place, the service, the view, the wine, the food, the desert, everything was top of the line. This was an unforgettable night. One thing that we did was to reserve the table. Overall Amazing."}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday at Jekyll's this past Saturday. Our first time to Jekyll's and we will definitely be back. There was a birthday card from the restaurant, a window view of the falls, great service, it was a win all the way around. We couldn't have been happier. My boyfriend had the trout and I had the scallops. The portions were plenty and both were great. They brought out a flour-less chocolate cake with a candle on it at the end. It was delicious! The personal touches for my birthday, great food, and great service are why I would recommend Jekyll's and give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fresh made potato chips with truffle oil, blue cheese and balsamic finish? Is it a dream or did I wake up in heaven? If you have a craving for potato chips and absolutely must have them, Jekyll's truffle chips are chips for grown ups. We ordered the chips and after receiving such a generous portion I was thinking that I should have just ordered a salad for dinner. However, the sea bass was very good although I could not finish it after all the chips. Next time we will order the chips and split an entree, which with Jekyll's portions, is plenty of food for two. We also had a wonderful bottle of wine (Merryvale?) that we would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by noting, subsequent to my posting, the GM of Jekyll's reached out to me both by phone and by email to apologize for the issues and indicate her desire to address the problems mentioned herein.     2/18/17: Jekyll's doesn't seem to ever deliver except for a burger at the bar.  We had dinner there last night and, well, where to start?  When we were being seated we had to pass by the server's station where it seemed like a convention of people in white shirts and red ties. It seemed every server in the place had gathered around at the same time to talk or do who knows what.   We ordered drinks and calamari to start.  We sat and sat for 10 minutes when the calamari came but no drinks - hmmmm, we only ordered two drinks and a Sprite.  But the calamari showed up.  The manager was the runner.  He put the appetizer size plate of calamari down on the table but it filled only half of the plate.  I asked  about the drinks and he said the calamari just gets done in like five minutes.  Ok, but is the bar so busy that calamari comes out of the kitchen faster than pouring 2 drinks and a Sprite?    Again we waited and assumed we would get fresh bread and butter as other guests had baskets on their tables.  I had to ask the waiter if we could get some bread, even if we had to pay.  Ok, no big deal.    The real deal breaker was the steaks we ordered.  We all got NY Strips - $34.00/ea.  Typically a NY Strip is approximately 14 oz.  The steaks we got were the thin cut steaks.  I've never been to a steakhouse in my life where a thin strip was served.  This steak was maybe 8 oz.  I mean, what are these folks thinking.  Half a plate of calamari.  Steaks that are nearly half the size you would expect.  And on top of all of that, the manager seemed almost catatonic.  He came over to see how we were doing in an almost a detached, mechanical manner.  Didn't even seem to connect.    Bottom line, after spending $250.00 for dinner, Jekyll's disappoints.  UPDATE - I received a follow up email from Hyde Park Restaurant's social media coordinator today, just one day after posting this, to apologize and see if I would be interested in speaking to a Jekyll's manager.  That's appreciated!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! The Best birthday dinner I have ever eaten. Our meal was outstanding!!  The fresh truffle chips were amazing!  The short ribs were outstanding, and the flourless chocolate cake was to die for!! Cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This time, we had just the best experience. Wonderful food and wine, fantastic service. Lovely view. Enough to up my review to five stars. Thank you, Jekyll's.  Except, clean up the cobwebs on the bar chandelier, please. Beyond gross!"}
{"text":"Calamari is the worst in the menu. Special drinks are a joke!! Service is horrible!! So disrespectful waiters. Never go back again!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, beautiful place.   We had a party of 8 - ate a ton & enjoyed the food. Lots of good fish options- the 'seasonal vegetable' was asparagus (not seasonal in December...) - but, that's not something to complain about.  Parking was a bit tough if you did not want to valet."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Jekyll's today at 5.  Absolutely, horrible.   Service was terrible!  Never got the bread we requested!   Had to ask for water, twice!  I ordered the short ribs, which I couldn't eat.  They tasted like heated up beef leftover from the night before...  I  Had to ask for the potatoes augratin I ordered, by time they came! we were just about done, in more ways than one.  My husband had the fillet, terrible, also.   WE WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our anniversary and the service was very good and the food was tremendous. The view of the falls from our window side table couldn't be beaten. Along with the Chagrin crowd walking the streets it was an altogether good experience!"}
{"text":"If Jekyll's wants to be a top tier restaurant to match their prices, they have lots of work to do.  The table overlooking the falls was great, and it was a busy Saturday night, but the 15 minute wait to get a drink was not acceptable. The selection of wines by the glass is limited and the bottle prices are more than 4 times retail.  Salads were good, but entrees were delivered and before two bites could be eaten, we were asked how everything was by the floating manager.  The short ribs were undercooked and drenched in a very rich mushroom gravy that soaked everything on the plate.  The manager was accommodating to take the meal off our bill, but not before he mentioned numerous times that that was one of their best dishes --  just in case I thought my tastes were refined...There are too many other places with better food and service."}
{"text":"the fam was in town and they were on the east side, so i trekked out here with my parents to have dinner.  the inside of the restaurant is not exactly what i expected but i thought it was really gorgeous. great view of the falls if you're into it, and the bar area is really cool and modern for something in chagrin falls. we had a table, but i kept getting up to creep by the bar to check the score of the ncaa basketball game that was on - you know, the one that led butler to play duke.  the menu is fairly varied - more casual fare - sandwiches, pizzas - and then more serious entrees - steaks, fish. i was somewhat disappointed with the fish/seafood options - salmon or tilapia? really? - but sucked it up and made a decision anyway.  i ended up having red meat which i almost never do, along with the beet and goat cheese salad. everything about the salad was excellent to me EXCEPT for how it was served. i wasn't into the stacks. everything tasted excellent, though. i had the beef with bacon, potatoes and asparagus. it might have been because i hadn't eaten all day, or because it was just that good, but i devoured the entire thing.  i am REALLY interested in going back during the week to have the scallops with blood orange.   everyone at my table seemed very happy with their salads and meals - my dad killed a half slab of the ribs after seeing someone else order them. we split the red velvet cake which was so good - lighter than the red velvet cake i make myself - and was an excellent end to a pretty wonderful meal.   good drink options, didn't have any absinthe though, and fairly good wine list. i'm always happy when i get malbec by the glass.   again, i can't imagine i would haul it all the way to chagrin falls to go here again (besides the fact that i want to force someone to meet me here during the week after work to have those scallops!) but it was very good."}
{"text":"We finally got back to Jekyll's since it reopened.  We sat outside on a beautiful evening.  The service, food and drinks were all excellent.  We shared a kale and brussel sprout salad (delicious).  My husband had the ribs and I had the beef short ribs.  Both were excellent.  We are very glad Jeklyll's is back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I made reservations for date night here. We have an almost two year old so date nights are a special night for us. We had reservations at 6:30 and we arrived on time. Greg, our waiter, was prompt to serve us our water and said he would give us a few moments and come back for our drinks. After 15 minutes of waiting he never came back. We decided to call another restaurant and got up to leave. On our way out what appeared to be a manager asked if we changed our mind, and I said yes we've been waiting and no one came back. She said I'm sorry and told me to have a good night. Very disappointed in this restaurant after hearing good things."}
{"text":"The setting is great with lots of Windows looking out at the Chagrin river. The menu is quite limited. The food is good (not great). The service was a little slow but OK. The hostess was rude, cold and unfriendly."}
{"text":"The view is the star at Jekyll's, with it's perfect location overlooking the falls. But the food is also excellent, if a bit pricey. The happy hour is a good deal if you work anywhere near Chagrin Falls, with $5 sushi and pizzas, and decent deals on wine and cocktails. If you stilll play Pokemon Go, you can sit at the bar or patio and hit 2-3 pokestops plus catch tons of water pokemon.   The bartenders are friendly and attentive. For dinner I recommend the scallops, which have always been cooked to perfection when I've had them. It is too bad that they are not open for lunch."}
{"text":"A one-star rating is somewhat alarming so I will preface this review with this disclaimer:  I visited Jekyll's a month or so after they opened and I will hope that they've worked out some of the kinks since then.  We went to celebrate my birthday, my brother's birthday, and my father's birthday (which all land within 8 days of one another).  We approach the hostess stand and give our name, reservation for 5.  The hostess says \"I only have you down for 4.\"  My father explains that he called two days before and made the reservation for five to which the hostess gets, frankly, rude and says \"You couldn't have made it for 5 because I take the reservations on Wednesday and I wouldn't have made it for 5 because we didn't have a table.\"  After a bit more back and forth she says \"Let me see what I can do,\" sighs loudly, and looks at her reservations.  Within 10 minutes, we're sitting at the most central table in the house.  So...if she was able to seat us, why the heck did she make it such a big deal?!  I've worked in client service for years (including a short stint as a hostess at an upscale French restaurant just after college) and, let me tell you this much, cupcake:  THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.  Bad start.  But, we have birthdays to celebrate so I let it roll.  We sit down and I take a look at the wine list.  Our server comes over and I ask her a few questions about some of the reds by the glass to which she replies, \"Well, I really don't know because I don't drink wine.\"  Not acceptable.  It's your product.  Sell me on something.  She does, however, kindly offer to have the manager come over and chat with me about the wines.  I pick something...we move on.  Our server returns and my mother asks a question about the menu.  Again, our server's reply, \"I don't eat fish, so, I don't really know.  But I sell a lot of that dish.\"  Dear lord...  The food was all \"okay.\"  My steak was over cooked (I ordered medium rare, it came slightly more than medium).  Calamari was decent.  The things that this place really has going for it are:  1.  The view of the falls. 2.  Awesome outside bar. 3.  \"Happening\" vibe (sometimes it's just fun to be out at a busy place).  Here's the thing.  I love to eat.  \"Dining\" is an experience.  If I just wanted good food, I'd cook at home.  I come out to restaurants to try new things, have a nice night out.  And when you're paying prices like those at Jekyll's, you should be rewarded with great service."}
{"text":"Ribeye was fantastic. Wife had the grouper and it was gone in a flash.  Sushi good, Manhattan probably the best I've had. Service is very good. No complaints, we will come back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since they re-built it. It's a really nice place and the food is really one of the best places in Chagrin. If you decide to make a reservation....ask for a view of the falls. It's a great romantic view. As far as food: the truffle chip are a must have!"}
{"text":"Cool place to grab a drink on the outside patio.  Although...I am a bit confused.  The outdoor bar is called Hyde's.  But Hyde's isn't listed as an establishment.  Anyway, belly up to the bar and order some really creative cocktails.  And listen to the Falls.  Great summer spot."}
{"text":"Five of us walked in without adequate accommodation, then walked out to Flip Side with a great experience."}
{"text":"Please don't let these stars trick you into thinking the food is great. It isn't. However there are some positives about this place.  1) location: you won't find a cuter village than Chagrin Falls. there are really cute falls, a lovely town square, monied residents parking their crazy expensive cars up and down the main street that boasts boutiques and restaurants alike. 5 stars for location.  2) the drinks were excellent. I had the Jekyll (huckleberry, lemon and vodka) and my buddy had the blood orange marg. both were very nice, taste was great and the pour was weighty. of course, you pay for that pour, those were some expensive cocktails. (if your drink is only 3 dollars cheaper than your entree it is a gut check moment)  So we wanted to sit outside because Ohio has been blessed with an epic climate and no bugs (i guess that's the trade off for the unemployment rate and the general population) and we got to! It was a bit of a three ring circus though. they have these pretty comfy chairs that have higher than coffee table height tables betwixt them, great for cocktailing, not so great for eating, we got one of those, but we really needed/wanted a table. The phrase 'he who hesitates is lost' (is that a real axiom or did i just mangle that?) has never been more true. A couple of times people got up from tables and we waffled about moving for a few seconds and by the time we got our s in gear the table was gone. I'm not assigning blame to anyone in particular for that... that said we finally got a table and we didn't have to eat at the weird couch table situation.  Service: They co-serve. We had Alfred and Lance, whatever you are picturing in your head for that is wrong. Trust me. The were very nice, unobtrusive but almost to the point of not offering great service. There was always a lag between drinks, A&L's fault because they waited til we were draining the dregs before asking if we needed another and the bartender's fault because once we finally got to order another he took his time getting them made. Which is sad, because they tasted good and I wanted to gulp mine.  To the food: we started with the calamari. Cheap, huge portion, great spicy/sweet/acid dipping sauce, but the calamari was sliced super thin so there was a big breading to squid ratio happening and as it was sliced so think it was overcooked. read: akron (rubber city- is it still funny if i have to explain it?)  He got the french dip. The meat was bland, the au jus was more bland than a can of swanson's beef broth, and the bread was crazy hard, almost too hard to deal with.  I got a pizza. it was pretty good. the italian sausage was light, the sauce was very rich, though it had a bit of a bottled taste to it. the bread was dense. but it was okay, good enough to take the leftovers home.  Speaking of leftovers, they came in a sack that listed all of the other restaurants in the family. One of which was Hyde Park. Oh! That explains it. Hyde Park is overrated and overhyped and this is its little brother. I'm not surprised at all that is was just okay. The owners just don't do great restaurants.   Bottom line, we'd go back for booze and atmosphere but we will be eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"We're dying for Jekyl;s to reopen!  Soon Soon Soon.  We really miss it!"}
{"text":"Tried to get dinner reservations last night at Jekyll's---unsuccessfully.  We went anyways  and figured we would sit in the bar or walk somewhere else.  Managed to snag a pair of couches on the patio to wait for a table.  Daniela Vallarelli, Manager, stopped by and asked if all was well and if there was anything she could do.  Since she wAs asking, sure, we were starved and would love a table.  Not five minutes went by and she was back with a wonderful table on the lower deck overlooking the falls.  The view was beautiful, drinks were refreshing and cold (white Frost) and the food was delicious (trout!!!).  Servers were attentive and funny. A dining experience that could have been \"good\" was elevated to \"fantastic evening\" because Daniela Vallarelli was awesome, and knows the meaning of excellent customer service. We are already planning on going back!"}
{"text":"The truffle chips were amazing. I had got the cucumber drink it was really nice and refreshing after shopping. The kale & Brussels sprout salad was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I am giving this place three stars because I have always received a good meal here, but people I have been with have not always been so lucky.  It it seems as though the food is hit or miss sometimes.  If you get there right at prime dinner hour, it is more hit than miss.  We tend to eat around those hours, either early with our son or later in the evening if we are out.  It's almost like the food doesn't get expedited properly or something.  The service here is terrible and always has been.  I think that it must be the location or something.  It was terrible in the bar seats and terrible in the dining room.  They do \"team\" serving, which I think is a load of crap.  Make one person responsible, that way they get douched when the service is terrible with a bad tip.  Makes it hard to do when one is just ok and the other is bad.  The outside of this restaurant looks so strange- it's almost goose poop brown colored with black awnings and red writing.  Just odd.  The interior is nice though and the bar area is great.  A word to those looking to go to the bar at night- you better be 50+ and divorced, because that is the prime clientèle at this meat market."}
{"text":"Great food, EXCELLENT drinks!! Best coconut, kiwi mojito!!  We beat the Friday night crowd by going in at 5p. The weather wasn't good enough to sit on the patio overlooking the Falls, nor was the patio bar open. However, we'll be back when it's warmer!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend. Have to agree with some of these comments about the wait staff. Once we were seated our servers were AWESOME but when we went to the bar while waiting for our table the bartender blatantly ignored us for a good 15 minutes. A couple came up they seemed to know and took their order while a group next to us even commented about it and laughed it off with us.  Now for the food- I could tell the go to was the flat breads which looked and smelled delicious but I was in the mood for sushi and went with the spicy tuna crunch- I thought it was done very well. My friend got a salad and said hers was good. Lots of options with goat cheese on the menu (which i loved so happy to see that!)   Overall a good variety of food choices (sushi, flat breads, steak, burgers, and more) so a way to find something everyone can like. Would like to return to try the flatbreads and hopefully get better service at the bar or go without a drink!"}
{"text":"The waiter was wonderful yesterday... the views were great... the food was a disappointment... except the truffle chips appetizer was amazing! But the salad I got was soaked in dressing; very over dressed I couldn't eat most of it... my husband order a $40 filet medium and it was out well done - cold on the outside and inside and the mashed potatoes were cold as well. The protein I had grilled on my salad was so salty I only had a few bites. I would not go back."}
{"text":"What an amazing place, start to finish one of the best nights my husband and I have had in Ohio and there have been plenty of wonderful nights here!  I made reservations on Friday morning for Saturday night, all they had was 4:30 and 9pm so I chose the 4:30 time slot.  We were attending the Chagrin Theater across the street at 8pm.  The Chef answers my calls and was so pleasant and helpful.  We arrived on time and our table was at the window over looking the falls - beautiful!  The decor is elegant, a bit rustic and subdued.  It breaths comfort and warmth.  The GM sat us and the manager on duty came out and introduced himself, he had heard it was our first time at Jekyll's.  He also brought us a complimentary serving of the truffle chips with balsamic reduction and Gorgonzola - epoch!!!! I am not a truffle person AT ALL but I have to say the combination of flavors was wonderful.  We also ordered the calamari and pepper - yummy a salad each and steaks (Hawaiian ribeye for me) (filet for my husband).  The food was fantastic - everything cooked to the right temperature and seasoned perfectly.  Several times during the evening the staff came and checked on how we were liking the service and we felt well attended too but not too much and never rushed.  We ended with coffee and a shared desert.  Just lovely . I would also like to mention there were several special occasions being celebrated around us (birthdays, bridal, anniversary) and each celebrated individual received a had written card from the staff and special touches like rose petals and napkins folded into roses for the anniversary.  Really a classy place.  Deserving of 10 stars"}
{"text":"Truffle chips were great As an appetizer  but we didn't find any nuts as the menu mentions. The house salad was really good and the dressing was a delicious citrus honey mixture. Refreshing.  Strip steak was good, tilapia  and pork chops were both very good. Brussels sprouts and asparagus sides were wonderful. Salted Carmel  Cheesecake was amazing."}
{"text":"Weeeelllll - I dunno, a hostess who introduces herself with, \"You can sit at this table here.  We have a busy night tonight, I expect you to leave within an hour and forty five minutes,\" doesn't work at a five star restaurant.  Doesn't help that we walked a mile from Bradley Street through blustery snow.  Amusing I guess, but amusing doesn't win stars.  Back to Gamekeepers next time!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the most accommodating places! They've provided us with special seating and treated us to appetizers and desserts on the house for special occasions! Amazing food and the view is beautiful! I will continue to come back here! The service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the bar atmosphere. Food and drink selections were perfect for a great afternoon experience. A special thanks to Anthony for taking such good care. Will definately recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Loved it here. We sat out on the patio with a view of the falls. Started with the truffles (per our waiters suggestion) and then had salmon and the 6 oz filet. Our waiter, Chris, was both knowledgeable about the food and friendly. We listened to all of his suggestions, and loved our experience here."}
{"text":"Somewhere between a 3 and a 4.  Located on Chagrin Falls proper, Jekyll's Kitchen features beautiful scenery and very enjoyable internal design.  Classy with a touch of rustic, it's a place that should remind the diner of americana.  The bar selection is fine... with the notable presence of Absinthe.  They bring a still water to create the whitish emulsion affect seen in Arak and Absinthe when mixed.  Quaint... and if you've never had Absinthe, not a bad place to try it.  I had grilled shrimp, sliders, a NY Strip and the red velvet cake.   The sliders were interesting in a chinese bread, with japanese seaweed, pulled pork and bit of chili sauce.  The shrimp was also fair.  The red velvet cake was reasonably decadent.  The steak was a mistake.  :/  If the steak had been steak house quality, I would give this place a solid 4.  As it is, It's a 4 with an asterisk.  My friends seemed to enjoy their pizzas however."}
{"text":"The dishes were expertly prepared and oh so tasty! My husband tackled the 14oz rib eye and enjoyed every bite. I had the beef short ribs and they were melt in your mouth delicious. The only reason I wouldn't rate it a 5 is because the spinach which was a side with the short ribs was so salty that they made my mouth pucker. The salted caramel cheesecake was just the right size and was beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Jekyll's Kitchen didn't go so well. The manager reached out to me and discussed our experience.  She was kind enough to send us a gift card so that we would give Jekyll's another try. We stopped in this past Friday for happy hour, which I heard was good. You need to sit in the bar area, a beautiful setting in a cold night. There are a number of drink specials but the food specials are limited. We had pizza, sushi and deviled eggs. All the items were good but I just wish there were more choices. Our service was great and the manager stopped by to make sure everything was okay. We still have some money left on our gift card and we're looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but honestly the service was slow as shit and the price was not inline with the service.   I eat in NYC, Chicago, and San Diego a lot and the prices here were higher than those cities and the servers and bartenders here didn't have a clue on how to service the customer.   Taking nearly two hours to get me an appetizer, entre, and dessert while the restaurant is barely 1/3 filled is not acceptable in my book.   The chefs here nailed it, great food, but the rest of the staff needs to shape up."}
{"text":"I would give Jeckyll's Kitchen's staff and setting a 10. The drinks were great, too. The only thing I found strange was the menu. It went from sushi to pizzas to really expensive steak and seafood entrees. It was a little all over the place but still good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and neither time has it disappointed. The food is amazing, I have gotten salmon both times and my wife has gotten a filet.  I usually eat a good portion of my wife's steak and they do a great job.  Cooked to perfection and worth the cost.    I'd advise you to make a reservation because there is no room to wait inside and wait times can be pretty long, especially on the weekend.  The last time I went I had a reservation and it made a huge difference.  The view of the falls is perfect for dates or romantic dinners.  There is also plenty to do around the area before or after dinner, parking can be a pain, but valet was only $3.00, so do that.    If you like fish or steak then go here and give it a try.  But please try to dress decently, it doesn't have a dress code, but it should. Seeing people dressed in sleeveless shirts and jean shorts hurts the overall atmosphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here on Valentines day with my boyfriend and we had a wonderful dinner overlooking the falls. The waitstaff was friendly and the meal was beyond delicious. The waitstaff checked on us frequently and made great menu suggestions. We will definitely be back; especially in the summer so we can enjoy our meal out on the patio."}
{"text":"Amazing .my wife and i decided to enjoy another evening.we had a server who was very attentive.  She was pleasant caring and filled our requirements.food was served hot and very tasty.thank you for being a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Easily one of the most mediocre restaurants in Cleveland.. Flavor profiles are terrible ... Price is high ... Menu needs help ... Miss the old jeckyls  .. Bad food .. High price .. But great patio for drinks"}
{"text":"I am from the area and love Jekyll's. The staff is always so friendly, fun and most important helpful! The food is amazing every time and the view is incredible. My favorite part is the outside bar and fireplace!   Great place! Great Location! Great people!"}
{"text":"Poor service and average food. The only redeeming part is the view of the falls. I've had to unfortunately  meet friends here at least 4 times and every time it's as bad as the prior. Between taking at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged at the bar or the waitress claiming they didn't had cucumber for a garnish for a drink, they just aren't good at taking care of customers.   The food is a mishmash of average dishes. From the subpar sushi roll to the average calamari, there are at least 4 other places with better food within 200 yards. Go there; don't reward mediocrity with your business."}
{"text":"The service was a standout here. The food was very good, but not great. This place is above average overall. Great ambiance with a nice bar/patio. The burger was good. It's a little loud, but a very fun environment. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, we did happy hour drink specials and appetizer specials. The service however left much to be desired. It started with our waiter giving us two menus for three people, and then not making eye contact for the next 10 minutes. We had the coconut lime mojitos, Which were excellent, except the third one was nothing like the first two. We told the waiter and he shrugged his shoulders and said a different bartender made it. How do you have a signature drink that varies by bartender? When we told the waiter that we didn't like the drink he started to disagree with us. I feel like the restaurant is so nice, the food is really excellent, the service should match.  There were other things that were just a bit off about our service, like dirty dishes on the table for a bit too long and also waiting for drinks for longer than we should. Very disappointed, we've been here before and been very pleased."}
{"text":"this place burnt down just letting everyone know it burnt down the beginning of October"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review.   Summary: Appetizers were great, some of the dinners were only okay, but service was exemplary.   The potato chips with truffle oil, goat cheese, candied pecans and balsamic vinaigrette reduction was the dinner winner. The beat & goat cheese salad was also a do over.   The short ribs were good, but I've had better. The duck was eeh. The steak with goat cheese was very good. The meat could have been more tender, but the smokey flavor in the caramelized crust was very good and not something you get at any steak house.   The service and the view are the real restaurant highlights. It is situated on a cliff overlooking the Chagrin Falls and has outside balconies.   A do over, but basically, I liked Blake's better. (This restaurant was Blake's until last year.)"}
{"text":"The Patio is a Chagrin Falls favorite, no matter the weather.  Umbrellas to shade you from the beaming sun and an open Fireplace to warm you on cooler days. Open bar to patio is so convenient!  The view of the famous falls is unforgettable.  Manager, Jeannie Osborne takes pride in her position and the rebuilt icon, Jekylls.   Stop by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The manager forced us to leave the restaurant because we had two animals. We were sitting outside BUT beyond this, BOTH were SERVICE dogs. This manager is appalling and a stain on an otherwise beautiful Chagrin Falls experience. I recommend not coming here if you have any sort of a moral standards."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to describe this place! The staff were the most friendly staff i have ever been served by.  The food was amazing!!! Had the boneless short ribs with bleu cheese crusted topping. It was the best meal i have ever had!! 150% recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon with my husband.   Pros: Beautiful location and outdoor/indoor seating. Drinks were pricey, but good. Waiter was kind.   Cons: Outdoor seating was \"seat yourself.\" However, when we walked in the front door there was no sign indicating this, just the hostess and some waiters chatting. We walked in and waited while they ignored us. Finally, they looked up and said nothing. We asked if we could sit outside and they said, \"you can sit anywhere\" and then went back to their conversation. My biggest complaint however was the food. We ordered salmon caesar salads. They were $16 and under the \"Greens\" section on the menu. They were smaller than most side salads I have ever had. My husband's salad had literally 2 croutons on it. The lettuce was soggy and the salmon was undercooked and had very little flavor. I wish I had taken a picture. It was just ridiculous!   May go back for drinks now that we know to seat ourselves, but I would be nervous to waste money on the food again."}
{"text":"I have been to Jekyll's three times now. After the first time, I only went again because friends were going. I hoped Jekyll's would redeem themselves. I was let down.   A brief summary of my poor experiences: Overcooked steak. Was supposed to get a polenta cake and instead was served a burnt fish cake and when I asked about it to the waiter, he said he thought it was right and didn't offer to get me the correct or properly cooked order.   On my most recent visit, the servers were rude and unhelpful. Despite telling our party of 15 that the kitchen was closed on Friday night at 10:00, there were cooks in the kitchen. 15 minutes later a couple next to us was served their dinner...  They had just completed service in the main dining area and were cleaning up. Unfortunately, the staff completely neglected the bar area where they still had paying customers. When I asked the bar tender if she could have a table cleared off, she replied by asking if I knew the kitchen was closed. I did know this because she had already told me. I responded by explaining that I simply wanted my friends to sit at a table without used dishes from the previous guests. Unbelievably rude and unhelpful staff.   Positives: nice decor with a good bar and a great view of the falls."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after walking around downtown chagrin falls. Nothing bad, nothing awesome. We had the truffled devil eggs and some wine. The food was good and the service was average. The decor was beautiful and it was cool that you could eat and overlook the falls."}
{"text":"In from out of state, getting family together including two elderly great grandparents and at least two others who have a hearing deficit. Friend had called two weeks in advance to make reservations, then they called her to remind her a week too early because they had written date in wrong. She was presented with an option of 5 pm or 9 pm at that point, when she asked to speak to a manager and explained that our reservations had been written down incorrectly and we were being punished for it. A manager named Jeff promised her that we would have a table at the correct time and on the right date. She explained that we needed an inside table to him as well, and why.  When our group of seven arrived, we were told that nothing was available inside and were seated outside by the falls. The problem was that between the falls, the loud obnoxious music that they claimed they couldn't turn off, and everyone trying to talk over all of this noise, our rare visit left everyone unable to hear each other! Note to Jekyll's: If you must play music in addition to the natural ambiance inherent to your location, make it soft acoustic or jazz rather than loud pop rock.  Food was sort of slow  in getting out but decent when it arrived, not earth shattering or anything. I'd suggest this place for lunch but skip it for times when you want to be assured of consistency and have a rare family get together."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Some plates were overcooked some were drowning in sauce. Great atmosphere very average food"}
{"text":"We went to Jekyll's last night 11-25-17, and were not pleased.  My husband ordered a fillet and I ordered the Ribeye and they were terrible.  After talking to the manager we found out the steaks were \"choice cut\" ( lower quality meat) and they were almost $40 each.  Very disappointing for the nicest place in Chagrin Falls.  The view was great, but way over priced for lower quality meat. The manager did comp our meals, but we left hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Called the restaurant to ask about seating today. Was told they don't take reservations but to come before 6 pm to get a table for dinner.   Arrived at 5:15 and was greeted by a quite unfriendly gentleman. We inquired about dining outside and he told us the patio is first come seating. We went to the outside patio to find a barlike atmosphere. Not what we wanted. Went back to the host stand and the same arrogant man was there. I stated that a table inside was what we wanted. Very arrogantly he told me the next table would be available at 9 pm. In three hours? How is this possible if reservations are not taken. I began to argue when a younger female hostess interrupted an explained we could wait for the next available seating.   I have a feeling the man generalized me and my companions since we were in jeans and casual attire. However, you never do this to a guest. First, I'm a local hotel executive and referrals will now cease to their establishment and second, I teach customer service to hospitality students at multiple local universities. Finally, I share poor customer service encounters with everyone I meet.   We ended up at the patio. Food was great. Atmosphere was nice. The server was attentive. The patio manager gave a free appetizer but not for the inconvenience, but because he recognized who I was. After explaining the rude host, he apologized but did no service recovery. Also, we sat where we could see the front door and many groups came in to be seated while we dined.   Final opinion, not worth the extra cash for poor service."}
{"text":"Visited, Saturday, March 24th, for a fabulous 80th birthday for my mom!  We booked one of the party rooms in the lower level. The room opens out to an outdoor patio which would have been nice if it were the summer.  The room fit our party of 15 comfortably and had a very cozy fireplace.  The large floor to ceiling windows made for a beautiful backdrop.    I mostly want to RAVE about the service!  We had two or three servers appointed specifically to our room, or so it seemed.  Water was refilled often, bottles of wine were replaced and food came out all together.  It was a busy Saturday night and the staff didn't miss a beat!  Truffle chips! Perfectly cooked steaks, flavorful short ribs, and fabulous fried chicken.   Thank you so much for a wonderful evening.  If you are looking for a place to have a rehearsal dinner, birthday party or office event, I highly recommend this restaurant!  We look forward to coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great location to see the Falls. The menu is varied and appetizers delicious. The pasta Bolognese was overlooked. The sauce was good but not exactly the taste of real bolognese in Italy. If the pasta had been cooked properly it would have been good. The staff is friendly and the whole place is lively and fun."}
{"text":"Great high end selection of food and wines all very good. But what blew me away was the dinning experience! Went for our Anniversary and we were treated like royalty , not as expensive as I thought it was going to be, we had a phenomenal experience for under  a hundred bucks, we will be back! Try the buffalo shrimp if they are still there!"}
{"text":"I came here with three of my friends on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8 pm. When we got there we had to wait slightly for them to set our table. We were very hungry, so we ordered two orders of the deviled eggs. They came out very quickly and were very good. Three of us ordered the roasted chicken and the other person got sushi. We all enjoyed our meals a lot. However, the chicken was slightly dry. The skin of the chicken was very good though. I got the the Brussels sprouts with my chicken instead of the mashed potatoes. The Brussels sprouts were cooked and seasoned very well. My friend enjoyed her sushi a lot as well. Overall all the meals were good, but the waitstaff was a little slow."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant. We had to make a reservation and when we arrived it was very busy, but we got a seat by the window that overlooked the falls. The view was amazing as was the ambiance of the entire restaurant; obviously they put a great deal of work into remodeling after the fire several years ago. Although it took awhile for our server to first come over (maybe 10 minutes) after that she was very friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious and well priced. When I made the reservation I let them know we were celebrating a birthday; they gave a card signed by all the employees and a complementary dessert (no singing happy birthday, thankfully) I definitely plan to return again and hope for the chance to use the outdoor seating, which again looks over the falls and matches the beauty and style of the entire restaurant"}
{"text":"One of the superior restaurants in this restaurant-challenged Cleveland area, my roommate and I had a WONDERFUL dinner at Jekyll.  Having stumbled across this place on a whim, we didn't have reservations and were told the wait would be 40 minutes for a table inside. However, as suggested by the hostess, the outside bar was full service and we could eat there if we didn't want to wait. We told her to let us know if a table opened up sooner inside, and proceeded to the outdoor bar. This option isn't bad if the weather is nice - the outdoor 'patio furniture' surrounds a fireplace and there are umbrellas over other tables and a long row of seats along the actual bar. Getting drinks/food out here would actually be fun w/ a group of friends on a warm evening. The crowd that night looked like a lot of older men with their desperate housewives of Chagrin Falls women,  BUT it'd still be cool to go with your friends.  About 30 minutes later, we had just put in our order (we took our time) and were told a table opened up inside. We decided to take it and were seated in the perfect corner by the windows overlooking the falls. Everyone who was serving us was extremely accommodating and friendly, even if one server took our orders outside and we were about to leave for another inside. The ambiance is excellent - good crowd, but not noisy, and even the area the restaurant is situated in is lovely. You could walk around this cute little town before or after your meal.  Although I cannot remember what they were, I do know we both liked our cocktails. We got the filet mignon medallions topped with goat cheese/pinenuts/cranberries and a potato au gratin and the baby short ribs in a wine reduction sauce over fried mushroom risotto and both were pretty a-maz-ing. The short ribs were quite fatty though if you are being careful of what you're eating, but it was really good.  A note on the menu - this place is awesome for those who don't mind spending a bit more on something like the filet mignon, but for those who are watching their budget, there is plenty on the menu for them too! From salads to pizza to steak or salmon, there's a wide range culinary and price-wise to choose from. There are also specials for every day of the week.  I'll definitely go back and this would also be a really good spot for my visiting parents."}
{"text":"Much improved since last going here.  The bitter that came with the rolls was the highlight of my dinner.  My salad was okay. My companion was happy with his meal though."}
{"text":"It was pricey for my husband and I, but we went for our wedding anniversary with the help of a gift card. We had the calamari for an appetizer. The crispy batter was light and the sauce phenomenal. I had a shrimp dish that was seasonal which was yummy and my husmand raved about his fish. They gave us a flourless chocolate cake for our anniversary. Better. Than. Sex. We had each had a cocktail and they were both very good if overpriced a bit. Portions were smaller than some American restaurants. We finished feeling pleasantly full with no leftovers. Great experience. Would recommend to anyone with a special occasion."}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had! Went for my boyfriend's birthday for the first time and it became one of my favorite restaurants. Our reservation was for 4:45pm but showed up at 4:20pm and they sat us right then and there. As soon as we got to our table there was a card sitting on the table which was a happy birthday card from the whole staff. I thought that was a nice gesture because I've never gone somewhere that did that. Our waiter named Chris was extremely pleasant and made great food recommendations. We ordered the Crispy Ginger Calamari for an appetizer which came with an amazing chili lime dipping sauce! Then as my entrée I ordered Southern Fried Chicken which also came with the best gravely and mashed potatoes I've ever eaten! My boyfriend ordered the Rustic Italian Sausage Pizza which was also very delicious and perfect size for one. Then they surprised us with a FREE little slice of chocolate cake as a birthday gift from them. Which was so delicious! Everything there was actually responsibly priced except for Grilled Steak and Seafood section which was pretty pricey. Our food all came out super quickly and they filled our waters constantly.  Amazing atmosphere with a beautiful window seat next to the falls and I will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"Very relaxing afternoon dining. Beautiful view of the falls and quaint shopping area with many specialty shops. Food and atmosphere at jekyll's was very nice. I enjoyed my omelette with smashed potatoes and the boys had the chicken and waffles which they enjoyed .Full bar available. relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"The setting and interior is very attractive. The staff was pleasant and attentive.  However, the brunch menu was uninspiring, wait time long and food mediocre."}
{"text":"My sister and I came in tonight for dinner.  Food was good, but the entire time we were here, the male and female bartenders had their backs to the customers and they always had dirty glasses in their hands shifting them from one place to another.  It seemed they both were new or something.  The girl never lifts her head to see if we needed something and we had trouble getting their attention.  I have been her hundreds of times and something was off. Neither of these bartenders should work in a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I ate here with his family to celebrate our engagement.  Like a good yelper, I looked online to see the reviews, and they kind of meshed with what my future mother-in-law had heard...great ambiance, so-so food.  This couldn't be further from what we experienced.  Our food was very, very good--a little rich, at points, but otherwise fantastic.  The whole family oohed and ahhed through the salad course, and ate in blissful near silence through the main.  The salmon was perfectly done (if a little on the rich side).  The four cheese pasta scored hits with both chicken and shrimp.  My short ribs were to die for.  The thing that stands out for us, though, is the SERVICE.  We had three servers through the night.  The first was kind of a doofus--he didn't really seem like he wanted to be there all that much, and kept saying \"super duper\".  But the second was attentive, and friendly.  Our third staff encounter was with the manager on for the night, Anthony, who came over, introduced himself, congratulated my fiancee and I on our impending nuptials, and then comp'ed us a bottle of champagne.  It didn't cost the restaurant much, but it was such a nice gesture that we'll be talking it up to all of our friends and neighbors in the Cleveland area.  Try this place out for a special occasion (or just for hell of it).  They'll bend over backwards for you.  Next time we're in Cleveland, we'll be back."}
{"text":"A couple of nights ago my date night I went to Jekyll's Kitchen. We were very disappointed. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. While the calamari had a nice flavor, it was overcooked. Fried calamari should only be fried for about a minute. It must have been fried for about 2 minutes because it was rubbery. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken. At first cut, the outside was nice and crisp. The inside was not moist at all. My date ordered the Pasta Bolognese. Very little sauce. Go for drinks before or after dinner and enjoy the spectacular View of the falls. Dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to Jekyll's Kitchen several times with my family.  A few times for dinner and once for brunch.  The brunch is good.  The last time was for dinner on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  It was packed and very loud.  It was hard to have a conversation across the table.  I bit too loud, even our server could barely hear us.  Our server was ok, left water glasses empty for a long time and not the most attentive.  Our table split the fresh truffle chips ($7) to start.  My family always orders these.  They are good, and a good price, but be advised they are a heavy dish.  For an entree I ordered another appetizer, the chef's sliders ($7.50).  Which that night were 2 tuna sliders.  The one was more cooked then the other.  I would have liked them a bit more pink.  The sliders were served with plain chips (same chips as are served with the appetizer), nothing special.  My boyfriend got the french dip ($13).  The sandwich was good although the au jus was a bit too salty for me.  Also, the fries it was served with were cold and soggy.  I was disappointed in this visit to Jekylls.  Also, in a past visit I ordered the original burger ($8.50) and was not impressed.  Overall I feel their food is a bit too salty and they use too much heavy cream.   But the view is amazing! And the restaurant is well decorated.  Also, the hostess is always friendly, nice, and checks your coat.  I would recommend trying Jekyll's Kitchen out, at least to stare at the Chagrin Falls water fall."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend in chagrin we decided to do Sunday morning brunch sat out on the patio by the falls what a nice location. Had the short rib hash it was more than I expected very good. Wish we went for dinner will make a point to go back and enjoy dinner inside overlooking the falls . Did not look at the wine list at 11am but looked like they had a very extensive selection .  Service was excellent very attentive friendly and a visit from the manager was appreciated"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Sweetest Day lunch! The second vice was a bit slow but the food & the view were amazing! So glad we stopped by!"}
{"text":"Crappy hour. We tried this place despite my trepidation. I said to my wife that I wasn't sure about a place that served pizza and sushi. We arrived and the staff were very nice and friendly, no complaints about the service, it was very good. We ordered drinks and the truffle chips, which tasted great, perhaps we should have stopped there, but no we did not. She ordered the spicy tuna sushi, and I the Italian sausage pizza. The presentation was great, however the food was not. The sushi looked like it was deep fried and it was warm, the pizza looked okay, but the bottom line is that I got home and within an hour I was on the toilet, and I spent the entire night, every several hours there. I will never return....to Jekylls that is!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant is that they are having an identity crisis. When you walk in the interior has a great design, the wait staff was well dressed and a nice looking wine cellar...however the entire menu is \"bar food\".  We started with our drink order. I had a palesner from Platform and my wife had prosecco. Both are drinks were refreshing.   For our starter we had the truffle chips, which were great! However it reminded of something I could order from a bar, but for much less at a bar.  Sticking with our bar theme I ordered a burger and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich, when in Rome I suppose. The burger was okay and she enjoyed her chicken sandwich.  For dessert we had some s'mores concoction. It was good as well but a little odd how it's served.   We were under the impression the restaurant had a \"fine dining\" menu, so we made the reservation for my wife's birthday. I was shocked they didn't even write happy birthday on the dessert...  Will likely return for happy hour only.   Service was great, was just expecting more based on the environment and atmosphere.   I would have gladly spent more money if the food was nicer, but I'm a little nervous to order an expensive steak of a menu that houses sushi/flatbreads/chips"}
{"text":"Trutfle chips, kale and brussell sprout salad were very good.  The best part about this place is the view of the falls and the general ambience. Meals here are pricey with entrees between 20-40$.  There's free parking after 6pm and all day Sunday.  It's a nice place to visit when in the area and the truffle chips drizzle in blue cheese are the most memorable offering.  It's a big portion, enough for four people to share."}
{"text":"I have been to Jekyll's several times since it has opened. I feel it's slightly better than average, but it's close to home so we go...service from the servers has always been good, it's the hostess that needs an attitude adjustment.   I had called on Monday 12/28 to make a reservation for 4 @ 7 pm for Wed 12/30. I was told they didn't have 7 pm available, so I asked for 6:45 and was told they had it so I took it. The conversation with the person who took the reservation lasted maybe about 5 minutes or so...  My husband and I arrive at Jekyll's ~ 6:35-6:40 and I give my name. They can't find my reservation.  Finally, the hostess finds it under 7:45. I tell her I didn't make a 7:45 reservation and she basically says 'tough'. 'You want to get seated, you need to be here at 7:45...we haven't had a 6:45 reservation available for the past two weeks...' Ok, so now I'm really ticked off because she hasn't even said 'sorry for the mix-up' and is treating me like I'm an idiot and that my time/business doesn't matter to their establishment.   We ended walking across the street to Rick's, where we had a great dinner and drinks. Great burgers!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and they treated us incredibly well. Had the seasonal shrimp appetizer and the salmon meal, while she had the scallops meal. Everything was cooked to perfection. Service was fantastic and the view of the falls was great. I would gladly come back and would recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"A nice spot in Chagrin Falls. I took my family here for brunch when my parents were in from Rhode Island. It was fantastic! The inside is big, clean and if you can sit on the back deck, it overlooks the falls in Chagrin. GREAT VIEW!  It was a nice time and I'm not sure if Jekyll's is best known for brunch! A little pricey but worth it, especially on special occasions! Service is two thumbs up.  Not a huge breakfast menu; however, it has everything you could ask for when having breakfast/brunch. Eggs, bacon, waffles, steak, salmon, home fries etc.  I recommend trying: the steak and eggs, Knife & Fork Brunch Burger (Smashed home fries, fried egg, chili hollandaise) or build your own omelet.   They also have coffee, milk, all kinds of juice and a full bar. Tasty Bloody Marys and Mimosas.  We will be back to try lunch and dinner soon and I'll update my review."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time all night.  The staff was really friendly and very attentive. a family trip from Buffalo, NY, My family came to Jekyll's for dinner on 4/23/2016 around 6:00pm. We did not have reservations so we waited in the bar for about 45 min for a table.  While waiting, we ordered a round of drinks and sat over to the side.  The bar tender checked on us a couple times to see if we needed anything else a couple of times.  The hostess also was very attentive just telling us how much longer the wait would be.  When we finally got to our table in the basement, we had a seat by the fireplace overlooking the falls.  What an awesome view!  We had the scallops and the short ribs with a side of mushrooms and asparagus.  Both had a beautiful presentation and the food was expertly prepared.  The bottled wine was very fairly priced. Our waiter was very attentive as well. We had a wonderful evening and the staff was fabulous. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Happened upon Jekyll's Kitchen on a late afternoon walk around Chagrin Falls.  Dinner on the patio on the first night it was open for the spring/summer!  Heaters above the bar took the slight chill out of the air...perfection!    He started with a Beefeater and tonic and I thoroughly enjoyed a Elderflower Pear martini.  Both were delightfully stout.  Watched the Indians game on the adjustable TVs above the bar and chatted with the staff and other patrons who also seemed to enjoy their drinks and meal.  For dinner, my husband had the KC strip, medium, with mashed potatos and green beans.  The steak was perfectly cooked and had a hint of a smoky flavor.  I had the Snake River rainbow trout with the lemon butter sauce, Gruyere potatos, and green beans...it was divine!  Would highly recommend Jekyll's Kitchen, particularly the patio overlooking the falls.  Very enjoyable Saturday!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. Came here for the first time last night.  Service from our server and the manager were top notch, food was outstanding (fried chicken with chorizo gravy was fantastic), drinks tasted great and of course the view of the falls is mesmorizing.  Price of everything was more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Great Bar and Outdoor bar area which is just about to open up.  The food is very good.  Make a reservation.  Great view of the falls.  Request a window table if eating inside."}
{"text":"Took my girl here and got to sit outside overlooking the falls. Spectacular view.  Ordered a manhattan and it got to me in about 2 minutes. Appetizer took 5 minutes. Truffle chips are amazing. It was an overall great dinner."}
{"text":"Nice view, if you can get it.  I lucked out and got the window to overlook the falls.  The food is great and the staff friendly and courteous.  The flatbread pizzas are pretty damned good, if I do say so myself.  Save room for desert though and hook it down the street and aroound the corner to Jenni's."}
{"text":"We were in Aurora on business. This little gem was a perfect get away. We had a the truffle chips which were phenomenal. For dinner we had the pesto pizza. It was wonderful. The view of the falls was a perfect setting."}
{"text":"I like to come back to this place. Usually, they have a great service, food and spectacular view of the falls. They carry a fair wine selection and some tasty items on the menu. My favorite is sushi salad that contains sushi and small salad on the side- yummy and solid portion.  One time we had issue with the servers, but the manager was able to resolve the situation.  Definitely, the place to try!"}
{"text":"Jekyll's patio is The perfect setting to grab a drink and a salad or appetizer.  We went on a Sunday afternoon.  Great kale salad, sandwiches and fries.  I loved the spicy tuna roll.   Everyone at my table liked their meal.  Service was fine.  We will go back for lunch or dinner.   A little upscale, I prefer to go to Jekyll's without my kids!"}
{"text":"I really was surprised by this place.  The setting was great with exposed break walls and beautiful views of the falls.  The service was very attentive and in sync and made sure our daughter was well taken care of.  The food ranges from burgers to lobster tails.  I enjoyed there French Dip sandwich and my wife loved her roast chicken.  All in all a good time with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this place! Having the falls in the back ground while you're eating is so nice! The food was great! They have  everything from pizza, steaks, fish, pasta, and even sushi ! Portions were good and the specialty drinks were delicious! Definitely a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Overall: I want to like this place since it's in amazing location, but they need better service and focus on a particular type of food.  Appearance: 5 stars.  Very well built and designed interior.  The outside patio is possibly the best in all of Cleveland.    Food: 3 stars.  Mixed.  They have a ton of variety (seafood, steak, pizza, sushi) and that usually means they don't do it all well.  The calamari was terrible; it was the smallest I've ever seen and almost all breading.  The sushi was mediocre but I like that they offer it. The salmon was very good.     Service: 2 stars.  The waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there, and gave sarcastic short answers.  Prices: 4 stars.  They are a bit high, but not bad for the area and a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Everyone here looked like they just got back from an especially rough weekend at Bernie's. The combination of the patio smelling like sunscreen and the Jimmy Buffet playing on repeat made me nauseous. Gamekeeper's patio is a much better choice unless you're the type of person who is looking to get wasted away in Margaritaville."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. We have gone 3 times now and it keeps getting better. I'd highly recommend their scallops if you enjoy seafood. Scallops are difficult to get right and they absolutely nail them - crispy outside with a decadently soft inside. Even better is that my wife is dairy free so they cooked it with Olive oil rather than butter and sacrificed zero flavor.   Their creme brulee is to die for also. Perfect ratio of sugar"}
{"text":"The menu seemed to be a bit all over the place. Menus such as this are so confusing and such a turn off for me.  I decided to go with their fried chicken because someone in my party recommended it. It was a great choice and was pleasantly surprised.  The chicken was moist and not too greasy.  Fries were okay nothing to sing about.  Our waiter was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about wine."}
{"text":"The Misses and I headed here at nearly 10 pm on a Sat night with a couple of friends and loved it.  The caramelized pecan and balsamic chips were crazy good.  Great view, great service, and (the true test) great wedge salad.  We closed the place down and the servers never complained or asked us to leave."}
{"text":"I'm a West-sider who is married to an East-sider (don't hold it against him: he's a great guy!!). So we have some friends who live on the East side, and one of them had a surprise birthday party for her husband last Saturday at Jekyll's. I don't go to the east side for just anyone, but the birthday boy is a good guy, so we ventured out! Jekyll's was fabulous! We had a cool view of the falls, fabulous service, amazing drinks and the food gets an A+. (Try the flourless cake if you have a sweet tooth that just won't stop like mine!). Next time we're on the east side, we'll definitely be hitting up Jekyll's again :)"}
{"text":"I can say enough good things!! It was our anniversary and they gave us free dessert and a table by the falls decorated with rose petals and candles!! New York strip steak was phenomenal!!!! Staff was on the ball and so awesome! Would recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could find something positive to say. Okay, the dessert, which was complementary, was amazing. Came here for my birthday with family. Hasn't been since before the fire and everything was amazing. This time it seems like they're under newer management. They had a christian music channel on. Not appropriate for a fine dining restaurant experience. Was really expecting with something like the Chill channel or jazz. The menu was limited and most dishes were what you find at an upscale bar. The service was ridiculously slow and they were not busy (Late Monday evening. My husband had told them ahead of time it's my birthday and they handed me a signed card. Nice but a dessert would have been nicer (without having to complain about the greasy truffle chips with a 80/20 sauce to chip ratio). I could go on but will suffice it to say go for Happy Hour, don't go for special occasions."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this little restaurant. I have never ventured into Chagrin Falls (I've been around it, but never to the actual place) and really enjoyed the town. The restaurant is off to the side of the main road/square, and it overlooks the falls as a result. The location is really great. We got reservations and got a seat by the window overlooking the falls. Basically, overlooking someone's wedding photos, which was kind of fun to watch.   The interior is really well done - very warm with exposed brick and a lot of red accents. I really enjoyed the decor. We were brought here because of the goat cheese crusted filet (my husband and I are known for our maybe-insane love of anything goat cheese, and if it has goat cheese, we are more than likely to eat it no matter what) and really didn't know much about the menu or anything prior to coming. I hadn't even looked up Yelp reviews. My father-in-law works nearby, and this is apparently a place they frequent for work dinners.  We ordered cocktails to start (I got the Jekyll and my husband the Hyde) and were happy with our selections. The huckleberry foam on top was quite good - albeit a bit weird mixed with the alcohol which surprised me - and the drink was well mixed and tasty. No complaints there. They were really on top of refilling waters - I never went thirsty.   We started with the truffle chips - which were delicious and probably my favorite thing I ate. Everything went well together (although we had to get the pecans on the side because of allergies) and we finished off the entire plate. Definitely would recommend it (and I saw a good amount of other tables devouring them too). We also shared the soup of the day - a broccoli and smoked cheddar soup - which was so amazingly delicious. It seemed the few big pieces of broccoli in the soup were steamed outside of the soup and then put in, so they weren't soggy, but a little crisp - which I really liked. The cheese in the soup was superb and gave it a great smokey flavor. Delicious.  My husband and I ordered two different dishes in order to \"share\" - he got the goat cheese crusted filet with potato au gratin and I got the boneless short ribs with blue cheese and mushroom risotto cake. The steak was good - it wasn't the best steak I have ever had - but the addition of goat cheese, cranberries, and balsamic glaze gave it a lot and I cannot deny that it made me love it. It was delicious. The potatoes au gratin were pretty good - cheese and very well cooked - but they same a bit salty and were hard to eat a lot of. But I really enjoyed them and would definitely order it again. The short ribs weren't as good - the sauce wasn't really tasty - it didn't really add anything to the dish like I had hoped - and the ribs were not the best I have had. Perhaps I like my short ribs on the bone. The mushroom risotto cake was good - but my husband kept comparing it to a McDonald's hashbrown, and while I originally rejected that, I came to realize it might be a little true. Still, it was good.   The service was great while we were here - they were really attentive about the nut allergy (more so that I was as I managed to eat a nut and then share ice cream with the husband after) and were always quick. Service was perfect.  I would definitely go back and recommend it. It was an adorable place with a lot of pluses."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I like going here as an alternative to Burntwood. In my opinion they have similar dishes. Jekyll's might actually have a slightly smaller menu... But they have much better view.   Short ribs are fabulous. So are the truffle fries. It's an awesome deal if you go for happy hour or Sunday brunch. Truthfully, I wouldn't go any other time. And I find the fact that they have a sushi menu weird, it doesn't seem to belong on their menu."}
{"text":"Today my family of 5 plus 2 kids, toddler and seven year old went to have lunch at this place. We walked in and the hostess( older one with short reddish hair)I'm assuming asked my sister if there is something she could help us with. Baffled my sister said yes we would like a table. The hostess rudely asked if they had her name. She said no. She said the only place she could seat us was in the downstairs patio. We literally were the first ones in the door when they opened at 3 pm. So we walk downstairs and get to the patio where it felt like a million degrees. It was 92 degrees outside today! The black awning and fans were pushing even more heat down towards the table. This was unacceptable for my 18 month old to sit in as the weather was already very uncomfortable. We ended up asking the nicer hostess that escorted us to the table if we could possibly be seated elsewhere. We ended up upstairs in the main patio where it was much cooler. Our waiter was pleasant and food was pretty good. The hostess had already ruined the experience for me though. I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life. The restaurant was busy but I do not feel it was so busy we couldn't get a table inside. She simply didn't think we were good enough to sit in the restaurant, I don't know If it was my children or what. I probably will never return because of her. She honestly should not be the hostess with an attitude like that!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a two-star rating except I liked sitting at the window looking at the Falls.  This is without a doubt the most unfriendly staff ever assembled!  I honestly thought it was a joke...the hostesses were simply MAD that we even walked in.  Waited 15 minutes when there were empty tables all around.  Our server barely spoke, and anyone else I encountered was just surly.  Maybe they all got fired minutes before we arrived??  The food was just okay - typical bar/bistro stuff. Don't go any crazier than a burger or you will be disappointed.  (Even then, we had to beg for ketchup?)  So strange, seems like a nice place that they dumped money into, so hire nicer people and get your act together???? There are much better places to spend your time and money!"}
{"text":"Ah, yes... They're back and better than before!  After hiking in the North Chagrin Metroparks, we decided to stop at the outside tables overlooking the falls.  The menu didn't offer a lot of choices, but we both decided on a burger.  With the sound of the falls enhancing our conversation, you couldn't help but feel a little frisky.  My lovely wife of 33 years kept slapping my hands away.  The romance was brought to the forefront with the ambiance.  Good food, good times.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Really torn on this review...the food I had was excellent, although I ordered a pepperoni pizza which is pretty hard to f up. I loved both of our waiters, although I don't get the co-serving thing which others have mentioned in their reviews as well. The vanilla rum punch was delicious, but I can only go 3 stars because two of my friends have gotten really sick from their food which makes me a little nervous about the kitchen."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to jekylls for the first dinner in Chagrin Falls. Six months later, we moved to the town next to Chagrin Falls now we eat there at least once a week.   We go there constantly for their happy hour where we chow down on their delicious Tuna Crunch Roll (without cream cheese because I can't have dairy) where it is so fresh it just melts in your mouth, or we order the flat breads which are the perfect size and is packed with flavor (also tastes amazing without cheese!). I suggest the Italian Sausage pizza...the olives on it makes it!  They also have amazing customer care! Everyone is so nice and it is very easy to build relationships. One time something was wrong wth my dish that was not a large problem at all and they took it back, brought us a new one, didn't charge it for us, then sent us home with their melt in your mouth flourless chocolate cake!   I am telling you, hands down amazing restaurant I tell everyone to go to!"}
{"text":"I am actually a big fan of Jekylls Kitchen in Chagrin Falls.   I recently dined there again with a group, we had a great spot indoor overlooking the falls.  My favorite parts: --the scene: great views of the falls, really nice outdoor bar and seating area, weather permitting, and love the village area.  Indoor dining is comfortable with big window views.   --food: a few of my favorites include the blue cheese balsamic potato chip things that I love.  Limited options but decent (American) sushi - yummy veggie roll.  Sides are also tasty - uniquely and well seasoned.  Somewhat limited vegetarian options but I left full and satisfied.  Update: no more veggie sushi, still limited on vegetarian options but they do have an amazing salad.  Some \"just OK\" of Jekylls: --the service:  hostess staff tend to be just OK, not super friendly when dealing with people without reservations.  Wait staff are much friendlier - I have seen an overall improvement in service quality in last 2 visits here.   --prices are on the more expensive side but not unreasonable.    Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Trina was a wonderful server!  I'm a dark liquor lover and she suggested the Falls Manhattan which packed a tasty and powerful punch.  And it came with amarena cherries....delish:)  The food, service and ambiance was just what we expected.  Thanks again Trina and staff at Jeykell's;)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, make sure you ask for a table by the window in advance if you want to see the falls.  Went for an anniversary dinner, the staff had a happy anniversary card and candles on the tale when we get there!   What a nice surprise!    Food is always great, and drinks are poured nicely, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My wife, Grandma and I came here for Sunday brunch. I got the beef hash Benedict and it was very good. Everything was very clean tasting and not overdone with spices or too much cooking oil. I ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice and it was the best I've ever ordered at a restaurant. My wife and grandma shared the chicken pizza which was delicious as well. Nice view overlooking the falls too!"}
{"text":"You know I really would love to give this place a better review, but it was just too much of a comedy of errors.  We went there on mothers day in the morning. They are not normally opened in the mornings ( and it showed). One of the people I was  going with is disabled and is really in need of some sort of handicap or close parking so they do not have to trudge around chagrin falls, as is customary. In order to assure things worked out my friend called them the night before to make sure that they did in fact have handicapped parking available. He was told, \"yes in front of the building.\" So fast forward to our arrive. There are no handicapped spots within shouting distance of the restaurant. I parked in the nearest spot I could and told him to call them again and inquire where the handicapped parking was. He did. The hostess seemed confused by his request. Put him on hold.......then....... as it was starting to hail....... the manager.... or who I believe was the manager comes out and tells us there are no handicapped parking but we do have valet. Nice so let me get this straight. Someone is disabled, needs accommodations, and you want us to pay to have someone else park the car. This site is a public site so I will refrain from typing what I was thinking. needless to say we left our car in the spot and my disabled friend walked... across the street, in off and on hail, using a walker (which becomes a lighting rod, in extreme weather) because someone miss informed him of the parking situation. Strike one.   Now strike 2: The service was not really good. I felt like I was being served by dial-a-server. Pre-trained servers provided to your restaurant at a moderate charge. The server or should I say server's were not well trained. They co-serve. What does that mean? Basically you can give orders or anything to either server.  That translates into,  Server 1: sir you want another drink?   Me:no the other guy is getting it.  Server 1: O okay well how about some more bread?  Me: great thank you.  Server 1 leaves server 2 comes back  Server 2: How about some more bread?  Me: The other guy is getting it.  Server 2: O great!   wow so you take something simple like communication and make it more difficult by adding a middle man... Smart idea..   Now onto the food itself: As I stated earlier they are not a breakfast/brunch place they usually do late lunch/dinner.   The food in my opinion was not worth the cost. My friend, I believe, ( in my opinion) actually got sick from the food. They served hash browns. I tasted them and they weren't regular potato's hash. They tasted like french fries that had been cut and mashed together... that's an odd taste first thing in the morning.  My friend had a seafood based soup as well as seafood breakfast dish with an egg on a biscuit..?  I have no idea what it was but he said the egg was supposed to be more runny... To me it looked more liked a hard boiled egg with something cheese like on it on a biscuit. yuck.   My french toast was really really really really lacking in flavor. It just was not good.   The dish I ordered came with bacon... I don't eat bacon... I asked if I could have something else?   NOPE. So they just took the bacon off... So I still payed for the dish as if the bacon was there... but I did not get it...  Not only is that a rip off, but it also borders on lack of care.  Some people do not eat certain foods because they are allergic, or perhaps their religion does not allow it. So instead of substituting it, you either force them into potentially contaminating the other food on the plate (again some religions do not even let forbidden foods touch none forbidden foods). And if someone is allergic to something and you refuse to substitute for it, guess who is responsible if you get sick on that food?    I really am bothered that my friend felt ill for the rest of the day after eating there. I don't like that. I am going to be a health inspector and feeling ill after a visit to a restaurant especially if it stops you from eating for the rest of the day is not a good sign. There was no fever or anything else to indicate that it was something else causing his sick feeling.  Final vote, don't go here. go anywhere else. I make better french toast than them."}
{"text":"I went with a group of girlfriends back to Jeckyl after their re-opening. The new layout lets you see more of the falls from the main dining room and the bar. The flow is much better. The food was amazing. I had the truffle chips, no one can resist these, and pizza. Everyone at my table enjoyed everything they ordered. We had perfect service as well. The place is always packed so plan ahead."}
{"text":"We have gone here for 3 Birthdays in a row!  We love, love, love their food.  Every time we go it's amazing!  All the dinners, apps, and desserts have been fabulous.  Their service is great and atmosphere wonderful -- right by the falls!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for vibe and ambiance.  Unfortunately we go out for dinner for the food and service. Our waitress (waitperson to be correct) was like she worked in Mel's diner.  She rushed our order and we received our entries in about five minutes after we ordered. The Manager brought us some weird sushi as a amuse Bouche.  Throughout our dinner our table was over loaded with plates, silverware, and used glasses.  No one bothered to bus our table or refill our water.  My wife liked her salmon,  my fried chicken was like McNuggets for a lot  more cash. I forgot to say our bread (rolls) were tossed on our table from the previously mentioned waitperson on a hurried pass by.  Also I asked for a drink half way through dinner and was served 15 minutes later after the waitperson served another table drinks and spent a lot of time taking their dinner order.  Good luck."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service was not so good! I had reservations at 8 for 4 people and we showed up and STILL had to wait 10 minutes for a table. We ordered two plates of the truffle deviled eggs, which were amazing! But they came out before we even ordered our main course and while we still had our menus. There was no bread or butter before dinner either. Luckily, our main course came out quickly. I had the spicy tuna crunch and I would definitely recommend it. The others in my party had the half roasted chicken, which was okay. The plus side to Jekyll's is the view, although we didn't get to sit in the patio section, we had a table overlooking the falls! I would come back just for the spicy tuna crunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for my sons birthday... Made the reservation a month prior, busy, holiday weekend, I get that... but the service was horrible, like I should have stayed home and made dinner myself and served myself and I would have had better service.  At one point, when a manager stopped by to check on how our food was, I had to ask him to clear the appetizer plates.  15 minutes after finishing our dinner, we had to ask for those plates to be cleared and for the check. We had to ask for the water glasses to be refilled.  We had the short rib, the Hawaiian ribeye, the scallops, deviled eggs, and French fries, the food was ok.  I was expecting much better.  If you can at all cook yourself, stay home, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Jekyll's is the best restaurant in Chagrin, hands down. I go there all the time as do my parents. We also have had a few private parties there, all of which have gone off without a hitch. The service is always great and attentive, every one is friendly. The atmosphere is warm and almost sensual. It's perfect for a date night, girl's night or for a business dinner. You really can't go wrong.   Must-Try: Calamari, Truffle Chips, Goat Cheese Crusted Filet Medallions, Penne Pasta Mac'N'Cheese with a balsamic drizzle (good with shrimp and/or chicken), Lobster Pizza! -- There are many other good things but those are my favorites!   I also suggest the drinks from the drink menu (listed on the back of the regular menu). They are all so creative and delicious. In the summer the Fountain of Youth is my favorite drink and sitting on the patio is my favorite hobby."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer was a little weak - some soggy and some chewy (-1 star). The Southern Fried Chicken entrée completely redeemed the meal... it was awesome.   We sat outside in the bar area. Couldn't see the falls but could hear it - a beautiful night."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. From the wonderful atmosphere to the amazing service. If you go in ask for Melissa she is the best!!! We've tried everything from the absinth to the wine and everything in between. One of my favorite dishes it the calamari, squeeze that lemon on it and gobble it down!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure about dinner, but love their happy hour! Great prices on fancy martini drinks. All of which were quite tasty AND packed a punch - a rare find at happy hours. Service was wonderful.  We tried 2 appetizers, and one was great. The other - shrimp - tasted a little funny to me. I was not impressed. But really that was overshadowed by the fun ambiance on a Friday around 6 pm. Lots of couples crowded around the bar and enjoying the yummy cocktails. A great time."}
{"text":"Well been here many times with my parents and loved it. Food is great. Came with friends- we are all in our mid 20s and have jobs. Our waitress ignored us, carded us and was dismissive. Great food but targets a certain clientele and tonight I wasn't it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I took my family out for a holiday dinner in the dead of winter. We were in the middle of a blizzard but boy was this place stuffed for a regular Thursday night! Parking is tough, especially in bad weather so good luck finding street parking.   We all loved the ambiance and the view of the falls (if you're lucky enough to be seated by the window) but I felt that the whole place was so cramped, full of narrow corners and waiters in a hurry to run into you!   I ordered the walleye and it was good. Hubby ordered the steak and his portions were tiny. My dad ordered the scallops and he needed to share someone else's entree in order to be full. The ribs dish was the only one that provided a decent portion of food. Prices are pretty high and unless you buy several appetizers, you might not be full. Taste was great all around. Our server was friendly and prompt. It's nice to experience this place but it's a little too pricey to go back multiple times."}
{"text":"Took my wife and family for dinner. It was my wife's birthday. This was a terrible experience my son ordered baby back ribs they where so tough you couldn't cut them with a knife. My wife ordered a ribeye steak it To was so tough and fatty. I had sushi nothing special. The service was just awful. They brought my son a pizza so he could have something to eat it was undercooked and so greasy like a wet diaper. We will never return to this place. The only thing good was the view of the falls."}
{"text":"Five star evening.  The service was excellent (it was Cali's first night there), staff was attentive and food was great.  Not as pricey as I expected, strongly recommend for a special event, or a cozy dinner.  Great tasty burgers and trout and salmon both given high marks.  Kudos to Stuart and his staff."}
{"text":"I stopped into jackal tonight with some friends to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. We sat in the bar area and had drinks and appetizers and some light salads. The remodel atmosphere and jackal since their fire is really very nice. There's lots of bright windows and a fun atmosphere. The drinks were OK I wouldn't say they were absolutely amazing but it's definitely worth a look on their menu to see if there something you there truffle potato chips were to die for and I really liked the kale salad. My girlfriends had calamari and Sam in and they like their meals as well. This is a great place to overlook the beautiful falls and have a nice appetizer and drinks or even a good dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful dinner, great service and beautiful view.  I made my reservation and they asked if it was for a special occasion. It was our wedding anniversary and they gave us a window seat, beautiful card and complimentary dessert.  Very pleased and will return! Hopefully very soon!"}
{"text":"Perfect salmon dinner, I am a sushi snob so their sushi roll was not the best. It had way too much rice. The atmosphere and the customer service were great. Definitely loved watching the falls while having dinner."}
{"text":"I had read some lackluster reviews and was worried about going to Jekyll's for a Christmas party with a group of 6 other women.  The place was very busy for a Monday evening.  A couple of us started in the bar where we were helped by our bartender, Rob.  He made sure to get our bottle of wine to the table when the rest of our party arrived.  So far, so good.  At our table, it took a trip to the Manager (by one of our group who knew him) when we hadn't been approached for quite awhile to even offer us water.  After that it took literally 30 seconds for 2 waitstaff and the Manager to come see us.  We were offered two complimentary appetizers as well as a verbal apology. After that we had very good and friendly service.  The potato chip app was very good.  Even those who didn't like Blue Cheese loved this.  The calamari rings were small but very tasty.  I had the beef short ribs which came with a mushroom risotto and sauteed spinach for $25.  It was truly excellent  both visually and taste wise.  The Salmon was also a big hit,  A big portion done beautifully with a choice of sauces.  Several others had the pan fried scallops.  They were tasty but could have used a darker sear especially since it presented a very beige dish when offered with the smashed potatoes.  It should have been paired with a colorful side dish.  I would have had the potatoes in the center with the scallops on top.  Then a green vegetable surrounding it or laid over top.  Overall, our experience was terrific and we thank Jekyll's for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner at Jekyll's because we wanted to be outside and enjoy the falls. We started our night at the bar. It was packed, waited for the staff to notice we wanted some refreshments. Hung out at a bar for a few after we received our drinks, but we smelled a foal smell at the bar. It smelled like the staff doesn't actually clean the bar area at all. It's a mix of old beer smell, food and mold smell. It was so strong we had to move over by the fireplace to try to get away from it. Jekyll's you need to take care of that!!! I notice customers sitting down and complaining about that smell.  We finally sat down waiting an hour just like the hostess said.  We waited at least 20 min before our young serve showed up to ask if we needed anything. Got drinks, ordered calamari appetizer and it showed up soggy. We waited about 25 min for our server to show up again to order more drinks and dinner. Finally ordered and eventually got our food. It was mediocre to say the lest. It's an expensive place and you expect better quality service and excellent food. We received none of the above. Disappointed since we live in the area and enjoy spending time in the village."}
{"text":"Requested a table with a view of the falls, and we got that for our dinner dining. The service was very good. We all ordered different dishes, and they were all delicious. Can't go wrong at Jekyll's."}
{"text":"I honestly think giving two stars is being EXTREMELY generous... Everything is sooo mediocre from the overly sugary cocktails to the basic food menu.. The only reason to come to jekylls is for the scenery.. The patio is nice overlooking the falls...   The food is horrible.. I've had everything on the menu from the sushi to the pizza.. Every time I have eaten the sushi, the rice has been extremely hard.. I know this isn't a sushi restaurant so I have really let the bad sushi slide..  The pizza taste exactly like the frozen digiorno pizza from the grocery store...    The fries are definitely far from good.. The sauce they bring out with them taste like nothing but mayo.. Which could be yummy if you like straight mayo on your fries   I LOVE cocktails and defiantly do not mind paying $10+ for an awesome cocktail.. I really felt like all I was drinking was sugar water.. Also I don't like $10+ cocktails that are premade... I felt like I was at a dive bar that was trying to slang sugary cocktails as quick as they could (and have you open and pour your own premade cocktail)   Its extremely over priced so if you're going to go here go for happy hour so you can get the mediocre food for mediocre prices"}
{"text":"I've been going to Jekyll's since it opened with my family. At first, we went every year (the six of us) around Christmas and paid a bill that flirted between $2-$3 hundred dollars. We were always satisfied with our service and our meals.   However, the last year or so this place has been slipping further and further into 'bad'. About a year ago we went and while I couldn't quite put my finger on it, the place seemed different. Our waitress was kind but inattentive. And the food was a bit on to too-salty side. But it wasn't terrible, and I wrote it off as a one time thing. Even the best restaurants have issues every once in awhile.  But about a month ago we returned. We spent $260 on dinner for five people. And I'll be honest, I am pissed.   Let me first say that I emailed the restaurant with my issues and have as of yet received no response. Nothing. So I decided to take my issues to Yelp. Perhaps this way someone working there will see it and respond.  Anywho, a month ago my family went to Jekyll's. We had a reservation and asked when we made it for a table by the window looking at the waterfall. We were told that it would be reserved for us. Because one in our party was older we went to their first meeting at 5pm and we were the second party in the restaurant. When the hostess tried to take us to a table not by the window I stepped up and said we'd asked for one of 'those' tables. She raised her eyebrow at me, shrugged and let us pick a table. I was mildly annoyed that she gave me such a resentful stare but I decided it wasn't a big deal and I wasn't going to freak out about it--maybe she was having a bad day.  When our waitress came around she was new. And by new I mean that woman was green if I ever saw it. I thought it was kind of strange that a place as expensive as this would hire a person who has very little serving experience. But she was nice, so I decided it wasn't a big deal either.   However, as the meal continued I got more and more annoyed. Here's why:  1. Our water glasses were only filled one time the entire meal. And we were there for almost 2 hours. 2. My Dad and Grandpa's coffee was never filled except when I personally got up, flagged a waitress who was not our own and told them about it. This was after both cups had been sitting empty for more than 15 minutes and when I'd tried to get our waitress she walked away before I could finish talking. 3. The potato gratin which was the side on four of our plates was so salty we couldn't eat it. Interesting enough, when I brought mine home the dog wouldn't even eat it.  4. The bottom of my Mom's caesar salad plate was covered in an orangey oil and the waitress didn't even notice, even though it was all down her sleeve. 5. My water glass, two of the forks on the table, and three side plates were dirty. As in visible scum and black flecks of what I assumed was pepper.   Now, all of that had happened before this next thing did. And I was honestly so mad, so furious I almost got up then and there and caused a scene. I did not because my Grandpa get's really unnerved by things like that and he had not noticed all the issues so I didn't want his perception of dinner to change. But this is why I initially wrote the email and this review.  When the food runner/busser brought out my Grandpa's salad with grilled salmon on top she did not tell him she was coming over his shoulder to set the plate down. His arms were on the table, one hand holding his coffee up, the other playing with his napkin. This woman DROPPED his plate on his arms. As in, she moved to set the plate down till it was about two inches from the table and then LET IT GO.   I was sitting directly across from my Grandpa when this happened and I watched him jerk in surprise as the plate hit his arms and his coffee sloshed. The food runner just walked away with a scowl on her face. No apology, no help cleaning up the coffee. Just gone.   My poor 89 year old WWII veteran grandpa dressed in his best suit, looking freaked out because a huge noise went off unexpectedly right in front of him.   I have worked in food service for years. I give the benefit of the doubt to waiters/waitresses/food staff all the time. But I was so mad I really did almost get up, go to her and demand not only an apology but an immediate action from the manager.   Needless to say, I am still extremely angry when I think about it. More so because Jekyll's has refused to respond when contacted. I'm at the point now where even after going to this restaurant 20+ times, I'm not sure I can go back.   It may be time to switch back to the Gamekeepers (where we went before Jekyll's opened).   And if the general manager from the restaurant is reading this, I would appreciate a response."}
{"text":"I noticed something very interesting about the reviews for this place. Yelpers who were celebrating a special occasion gave 4 or 5 stars, and us regular schmos gave 3 or less. That should tell you something right there. Isn't any time I spend my hard earned money a special occasion? Then why isn't it treated as such?  Here's a quick run-down. As everyone has stated, the food is great. The chefs are not the issue. Either is the space that overlooks the falls (how can you screw that up?). The main problem? SERVICE. WAS. AWFULLLLL!!!!!  I was with a small group that went for dinner. We ordered nothing fancy, no drinks, or desserts, just dinner with no special requests. It took two hours. They have bread plates on the table which leaves one with the impression that they will give you something to place on top of it. We asked for bread, and our very casual waiter (which I'll get to in a moment) said he would bring us some. An hour later (still waiting for dinner), no bread.    The waiter was very abrupt and almost talked to us like we were his younger siblings or something. No etiquette whatsoever.   Even though the food was great, this place isn't worth it if they can't offer halfway decent service. PS- we never got that bread."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Jekyll's Kitchen for a long time (long before the first building burned down), and I have to say that it is my favorite restaurant in Chagrin Falls. Let me start with the atmosphere: located directly next to the waterfall, Jekyll's has the best views in town (always ask to be seated by the windows when you make a reservation). White table clothes and excellent service make it feel like a fine dining experience, but you won't have to worry about the price tag (we ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and two drinks each for less than $75). Which brings me to the food: always excellent. I've tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. This is a perfect place to bring friends or a date, because they really do have options to please everyone. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Met some friends in Chagrin for dinner and drinks.  The food was very good but the service was terrible.  Maybe 20 somethings aren't their crowd or it was a bad night.  I recommend the pizzas and the truffle chips.  I will try them again and I hope they just had an off night."}
{"text":"My food experiences here have been OK, nothing amazing but pretty good. The real fun here is the outside patio bar called Hyde's. It is always fun and the bartenders are great."}
{"text":"Excellent! Haven't been here in a long time! The grouper was amazing! Atmosphere was beautiful. We sat right by the window and got to look at the falls during dinner."}
