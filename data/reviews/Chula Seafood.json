{"text":"Wow, I don't know much about Poke bowls, but this was wonderful.  It was a little expensive so not an everyday lunch place (for me).  But will be coming back for sure!  I think I'll work my way down the menu and will have to pop in on a Saturday.  My first time was Friday Jan. 20th."}
{"text":"I eat poke about once a week, but this was my first time at Chula.  Definitely the freshest fish compared to other poke places.  The bowls have distinct, well developed flavors that make each bowl stand out as a winner.  Looking forward to going back to try the other specials of the day!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and recommendations on how to prepare.  Every one of the bowls on the chalkboard sounded fantastic. Will try them on another visit"}
{"text":"Came for a poke lunch and left with freshest piece of sea bass I've ever had so I could make it for dinner.  You must try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! I've had poke in San Diego and Hawaii and this place is on par with fresh and flavorful poke bowls. I'd highly recommend trying this place out... the owners were very friendly and helped explain everything in their menu..."}
{"text":"Freshest fish you can find in Scottsdale. This is technically a fish shop but they also do a limited poke bowl menu. It's a little pricey but well worth it, by far my #1 place for the freshest fish available in the area."}
{"text":"I am a native of this area and grew up believing fish is smelly and horrible tasting but Chula Seafood has has proved this wrong!  It's true fresh fish is awesome, and Chula Seafood has it. This place has completely changed my views on fish and the best part is my family and I own Salon Rock which is in the same plaza so we have a great new lunch or dinner spot we can walk to. The service is great and they're open until 7:00!"}
{"text":"My son and I came in today to pick up some tuna to make our own poke, and some swordfish to grill. The quality of the fish is outstanding and the service was great! We will definitely be back, and we can't wait to try the poke bowls!"}
{"text":"The ahi is like butter, it's that GOOD :) so happy to have this place out in the desert!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Chula seafood after seeing a post on IG and I was not disappointed.  The salmon bagel was by far the best one I have ever had. I will definitely make the trip to Scottsdale again just for a salmon bagel."}
{"text":"First time trying this place for a quick lunch, and it was the freshest seafood I have had in the Phoenix area. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best poke ever. It's so fresh! It's so nice to finally have a great lunch spot close to home. The staff is super friendly and they love to chat. It's a little pricier than other poke places but I wouldn't change anything about it! I've had both the Hawaiian poke bowl and the Saturday salmon bagel special - both fresh, delicious, and full of great flavors. I have to use up some seafood I have at home first, but I can't wait to try their fresh fish for some at-home sushi! Yum! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Expensive and skimpy portions. Don't believe the hype. $14 for a little, quite ungenerous scoop of fish on some rice and veges. Ok so, it's \"sustainable\" and fresh seafood. But If they're so conscientious, then why do they serve everything \"eat in\", \"to go\" and drinks completely in plastic with nowhere to recycle. There's too many others tasty Poke places popping up, where you don't leave hungry and feeling like you just got ripped off. One more thing...I'm pretty low key...but when you want to charge that kind of money...at least act like you somewhat appreciate my business. One guy there, stockier, round face, blue eyes. Couldn't crack a smile to save his life. We drove 25 mins to check it out. Won't be doing it again."}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem. We tried the Hawaiian Poke, Thai Peanut Bowl, and Spicy Tuna bowl. Everything was AMAZING!! Best raw fish we've had anywhere, paired with fresh veggies and incredibly tasty (but not overdone) seasoning. Another reviewer said the tuna is like butter. Perfect description. Equally impressive was the service. We'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is a hidden gem. While my friend and I had the Thai bowl with rice noodles, there isn't anything on the menu I wouldn't try."}
{"text":"I checked this place out last weekend. I found this little gem via Yelp while getting my oil changed down the street. I ordered the salmon bagel, spicy tuna bowl and the Mac salad to go. My wife and I loved every bit of it. The bagel lives up to the hype, perfectly executed. The spicy tuna bowl was constructed with expert precision and tasted incredible. Mac salad was Mac daddy delicious. On my next visit I will definitely grab some beautiful fish to take home and cook. Staff was super friendly and the environment was clean and cool. Definitely worth checking out. (I think the Wednesday special is the salmon pastrami, it's on my radar ;)"}
{"text":"It's good. I really have no idea if it's really \"fresh\". But all there meal options are good since you can basically try them all after a few visits. Good iced tea. Small location, but every time I have went on the weekend it was no issue sitting down. The only negative is the prices are high and the portions are small, but I guess you are getting what you pay for. So don't plan on taking home leftovers."}
{"text":"Great for lunch and even better for the fish counter to cook at home...I've been in AZ for a little over a year and was talking to a friend about not having found a great place to buy seafood yet.  He recommend Chula and it lives up to the hype...I've had the bowls a couple times (they're delicious), but I basically stop in every weekend to get something to throw on the grill.  The swordfish is always a solid choice and I love how I can try different things like Ono or Opah depending on what they caught that week."}
{"text":"I had food from there last night at a friends bridal shower. It was amazing!!!! It was delicious and fresh and I could not stop eating. Wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really picky about my seafood being from Seattle and this is the best, freshest fish I've ever had! The sashimi platter was delicious and I highly recommend the Thai poke bowl as well. I wish I lived in town so I could frequent regularly and take home fish to grill."}
{"text":"Great new find for us. Fish could not fresher. The fresh fish market has many choices to take home  Had the Tuna Sandwich. Excellent and different. On Noble bread. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and gave Chula a try and was pleasantly surprised. Best raw tuna I think I've ever had and the poke tuna salad was so fresh bursting with flavors and veggies. I ended up coming back multiple times because it was so awesome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The only place to buy seafood to cook at home in PHX, and their bowls are awesome. The only comparable place I've tried for seafood is Pikes Pier."}
{"text":"BEST SEAFOOD IN THE VALLEY HANDS DOWN! I order the tuna poke by the pound. Not the bowl, but just the tuna cut into bite size morsels. Sauce on the side. It's heavenly.  Follow them on ig for details on oyster pop ups."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time to pick up dinner tonight, sushi grade yellowfin sashimi and seared scallops was on the menu. The quality of product is great and all the options they had were fresh and well presented. Finally, a local option for great seafood!"}
{"text":"boom. support these guys. great food, fresh fish, reasonable prices for a quality bowl of chopped fish and fresh local veg. no mystery poke here, these guys know what they are doing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots...small & quaint but so good and fresh!! I LOVE the Thai Peanut Bowl!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a couple of poke bows and was blown away at their creativity and freshness.  The fish that was used was top shelf!  Too many fresh vegetables to name and a light homemade sauce went well with my selection.  The real reason to return is the quality and attention to detail given to my meals.  No cafeteria line here!   I can't wait to go back and try something else next visit!"}
{"text":"This is your one stop shop. Poke and other bowls are available, but you simply cannot buy this fresh of fish by the pound from a family owned and operated outfit anywhere in Phoenix. If you truly want boat to table fish, sustainably caught, never frozen, and with a personable touch this is your place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around 12 on a Friday and it was packed! After enjoying their food I understand the hype. I had the sweet and sour salmon and the Vietnamese cold brew. Mind blowing. Freshest fish I've had in awhile, great service from ordering to being served. If you're in the area, if you're not in the area, make the trip! Beautiful presentation as well, first time I've been more excited to eat than to take a picture first!"}
{"text":"After passing this place on my way home for many months I finally decided to try it out after seeing that it had good reviews on Yelp.  The Hawaiian Poke Bowl was amazing and my only regret is not trying this place out sooner!  The seafood and vegetables were fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant was inviting and would be a great place to grab lunch or dinner.  They also have seafood for sale and I can't wait to try that out as well!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Chula Seafood and it was memorable! The place is spotless, service is friendly and informed. The seafood is beautiful, fresh, and so delicious. We ordered the thai peanut bowl, bagel sandwich, 2 pieces of swordfish, and a piece of tuna to go. We couldn't wait for the long drive (45 min) home so we started on the peanut bowl in the car! The albacore tuna used was superb - so fresh! I prepared both the swordfish and the tuna on the stove top - nice sear on both! The fish was flavorful and tender - amazing! This could get to be a real addiction. Thankfully my daughter found this wonderful place for excellent, fresh, healthy fish.  I can't wait to go back!  By the way, yes, the place is located in a very unassuming strip plaza but it is easy to spot, lots of parking right near the door, and like I said, it is super clean inside. I really don't care where they are located - it is what's inside that counts! Thanks John for bringing fabulous fish to the seafood starved desert southwest!"}
{"text":"We love seafood and were excited to find a new fresh fish market in Phoenix.  As our first experiment we decided to try their swordfish since they catch it themselves in San Diego.  The swordfish pieces were the perfect size and had no skin or blood lines, unlike swordfish bought elsewhere.  There was no fishy smell and the swordfish tasted clean, mild and moist. We grilled it at home with North African spices and yogurt sauce, served with saffron couscous. This is the best-quality swordfish I've had."}
{"text":"Ok - this may be the best thing going in Phoenix restaurant wise.  I have probably eaten there 30 times in the last 9 months and do not think I will be slowing down.  I have had everything on the menu several times and taken home seafood to cook.  Everything is top notch in terms of quality and freshness from the seafood vegetables.  The crew working there consistently deliver well put together food and could not be more polite and easy going.  The only negative I will jokingly raise is they have nearly ruined having poke anywhere else.  The rise of poke as a quick and relatively healthful option was a real plus for me in the food world, but they can not hold a candle to the awesomeness of CHULA!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!   Especially if you're a Hawai`i transplant like we are, searching the desert for fresh Ahi!  We had the Hawaiian Poke bowl & it was delish! Different from a Hawaiian Poke bowl that you would get in the state of Hawai`i, but still good.  So far, the freshest fish we have found in AZ.  We're just really stoked about being able to buy fresh Ahi so we can make \"Poke To Your Taste\"...(y'know, like on the B.I.)  We will definitely be back to try more things from the menu as well as buy blocks of fresh Ahi.  They have more than just fresh Ahi, so please go check them out and support this awesome source of fresh seafood!"}
{"text":"This place is freakin awesome. You can order tune pre cut for poke and you can either buy it like that or have them mix it up in heir poke sauce/seasoning. The salmon bagel is ridiculous, it's not made with lox but with smoked salmon they smoke. About to make the pink sea bass tonight! This place rocks."}
{"text":"This place is great! Finally really fresh fish in the desert. Expensive, but worth it! I will go as often as I can afford it. The Poke by the pound was great, and I got some salmon, and yellow tail which I ate sashimi style. Delicious. Family owned too!! :)"}
{"text":"Bout time we have a place like this in the valley. Hands down the freshest fish in town and at such a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This place is as  fresh as it gets ..and I mean that both literally AND figuratively. John, the owner, was so friendly, and made sure that our first time at Chula was great. I love the fact that he drives twice a week to San Diego just to get fresh fish to feed his customers. Now that's dedication to provide his customers with the best of the best! I had the Hawaiian poke bowl and it was fabulous. Also important to note that the interior of the place made me feel like I was grubbing at somewhere in Carlsbad, CA. Very cool. After all, what's good food without good ambiance.  The only downside is that the portions are modest, so if you're really hungry I suggest you order the XL bowl. Will be back for some more poke soon!"}
{"text":"You've got to try the Hawaiian style poke bowl! We finally got to try this place and it was amazing. The yellowfin tuna melts in your mouth. Best poke bowl ever. Customer service is wonderful as well. The fish is so fresh that I'm definitely looking into buying some fillets to cook at home next time. Their daily specials are off the hook too. Love it!"}
{"text":"The bomb.com!! I had the Thai peanut poke bowl and it was delicious- the noodles, flavoring, fish, and all the veggies in it were perfectly paired. My mom had the Spicy tuna bowl wish she loved and boyfriend had the daily special - smoke pastrami salmon sandwich (which he still is talking about days later)! Very good customer service, would return again! I love that you can buy fish from them as well, the chimichurri swordfish kabobs looked too good to be true. Love what they are doing, hope they keep the small shop feel as they become more popular!"}
{"text":"A hidden Gem! I cook for others for a living. I am always looking for the best ingredients, to make the best food. One difficulty that has always been a constant in Arizona, finding fresh fish without paying an arm and leg for it. Search no further. Chula Seafood sells fresh fish! Not only is it unbelievably fresh, its a fair price. The reason why, the owners have fishing boats in California(hence the name Chula), and they cut out the middle man.  I have not tried any of the food on the menu, but I would have to believe if they use the fish they sell, everything will be great! Support local, small business!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. From walking in the door and being greeted by the owner (I think. I didn't ask his name because I was so excited about my order) to enjoying our super awesome poke bowls and tuna sandwich, in the right environment with reggae playing in the background. Great for the whole family, kids said it was not a home run, it was a grand slam. We had spicy tune bowl, Hawaiian bowl, Thai peanut bowl and tuna sandwich. Well done Chula!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today.  I have lived in the neighborhood for 4 years and didn't know Chula Seafood existed until today; heard about it from a friend.  Got the Spicy Tuna Bowl and it was delish!  Great presentation and taste.  Owner was there and took our order; he and everyone were very nice.  Hole in the wall that gets overlooked, I'm sure, but the place was hoppin' the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful first experience! The fish and vegetables were so fresh in my poke bowl! I also loved the atmosphere of the place. Such great decorations and just very well put together. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This establishment is less than a 10 minute walk from where I live and that is dangerous...you will read why... They are located in the same storefront where Pesto Prima used to operate, just down the building from Pub Rock.  Oh boy!!! After having a dish for lunch, it is hard to dispute their 5 star rating!  The flavors are unbelievably good and the amount is just right. Next time I want to overdo it and order an XL bowl.  The food is super savory and by the looks and taste I believe they deliver exceptional quality. In my opinion, for what is included in the Poke bowl, the price is right. Of course it will be more than the run of the mill fast food restaurants...this is by no means \"fast-food\".  I am happy to contribute yet another 5 star rating to their Yelp reviews and I am for certain I will not be the last person to submit a high rating. I will be back.  Two locations. One in San Diego, CA and one in Phoenix (Scottsdale), AZ. Open Wednesday through Saturday.  Support your local businesses."}
{"text":"This place is great. It is all about the fresh fish by the pound or the handful of poke dishes or salads that are on the menu weekly. Family owned and everything tastes really fresh. They are open Wed-Sat and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The salmon was so buttery and good! Fresh sashimi grade fish! Fish are seasonal and fresh. They also have really good poke bowls that they freshly prepare. It's a small business in a plaza but the quality was great"}
{"text":"Stop reading yelp and go here.  Walk up to counter and order anything and you won't be disappointed.  As you leave order any of the fish or scallops/shrimp to take home and it's unreal.  The quality and freshness of the seafood here can't be matched.  Employees and owners obviously take pride in their products and it shows."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and it is located in an unsightly strip mall.  The inside of The restaurant seats less than a dozen but is tastefully decorated and will be a great place to get poké.  I ordered the Hawaiian poke bowl which was $14. Although it was not a large dish, it is about quality of the fish and presentation.  The vegetables were uniformly cut and aesthetically pleasing.   There was also a sufficient quantity of yellow fin tuna with good sesame flavor.  The tuna cuts were not uniform and the cubes seemed a little big in size for the dish, but that is just my opinion.  I was eating with chopsticks and 2 or 3 pieces of fish in your mouth seemed unbalanced to the rest of the cuts of vegetables in the bowl.  My observation was that great care was taken in the vegetable slicing, but the same attention was not made to the tuna which is the highlight.  for the price point, I would expect both.  Overall, flavor always wins out and I would definitely return to try some of the other dishes. You can also pick up some good quality fresh fish that has been caught from the Pacific down near San Diego."}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. SO good. You can smell how fresh the fish is when you walk in the door. Great customer service and a cool place to hang out. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Sustainable seafood haven in the middle of the desert!! So glad I stumbled upon this best kept secret of Scottsdale. I was contemplating on whether to get the regular size or XL spicy tuna bowl, thinking I'll take the rest of to go!! There was nothing left in the bowl to go! A must stop !!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly welcoming and service. Amazing food, love the flavor and heat in each bowl. Not your typical poke, thank goodness. Lots of fresh vibrant flavors. Got 3 different bowls, all delightfully different."}
{"text":"Yep...as good as all the reviews said...unprecedented 100% 5-star reviews.  Our choices were spicy tuna poke bowl and smoked pastrami salmon sandwich.  Next time I plan to buy some fresh fish for grilling!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the highest quality and dopest vibe!! Chula is hands down the only place for fresh seafood! If you're on that Poke craze, why eat previously frozen fish, when you can have the freshest seafood in AZ!!! CHULA is the only place that comes close to the islands!! #lifetimefan"}
{"text":"Bar none the best seafood in the valley! We have been eating here for a while and everything on their menu is fantastic. For those of you trying this place for the first time don't worry, the line moves fast. Highly recommend the Thai peanut bowl and spicy tuna bowl. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I 100% recommend it for fresh poke bowls and fresh fish to take home to prepare! Nothing has been frozen and tastes very fresh and delicious. I had the sweet and sour salmon poke and it's the best poke bowl I've had thus far!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I had the Thai peanut bowl with smoked salmon and it was amazing! It was the first time eating a poke bowl and I really enjoyed it. The employees were super helpful and laid back. Will come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Tuna Bowl, and Melissa had the kids meal which was yellowtail, edamame,pineapple,rice and some other stuff. Mine was tuna, rice, alvacado, boo choy, and other stuff. Read the menu for details. It was excellent. Close to me, and lots of parking.  They are also a fish market. Picked up some bigass rocky point shrimp and some sea bass filets. It's in a funky parking lot with a dive bar, pet hospital and an Asian restaurant- hmmm. Definitely going back again"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh!!!! Just like the reviews said (which is why we decided to try this place and drive past 3 others)   They bring in their own FRESH WHOLE fish  from CA twice a week!  ...Then cut the fish properly as well making sure there's no sinew  at all, it's totally worth the price as it's the highest quality fish I've found in AZ In The 17 years we have lived here. I'm originally from the gulf area so I love seafood  Price average will run you $12-14 per person. Worth it!!! I'm cheap normally so Trust me!!!  Very accommodating for my diet restrictions too. We're eating low carb and I'm allergic too pineapple  but the owner didn't bat an eye. He made sure pineapple didn't touch my food and sub'd out rice for mixed green salad.   It doesn't even smell like fish in here which is a good sign. If you ever smell fish in a sushi restaurant I hope you know you  should run.   Only open Wed- Sat which makes it even more special in my opinion. You can dine in, order to go, or buy a verity of things to cook at home.   We came on a Saturday and ate in then bought some smoked salmon pastrami for breakfast on Sunday."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and I was completely blown away by the customer service and the food! My daughter got a basil lemonade that was sweet and delicious. I took home marinated swordfish skewers and Scottish Salmon.  I took them home and put them on the BBQ. The swordfish melted in my mouth and was so incredibly delicious. My hubby and son who aren't fish eaters loved it also! The salmon was really good and I so appreciated a properly filets fish  (no bones) ! My biggest issue with living in AZ is fish not being properly fileted.. This really is your true fish monger. ! I'm so happy to finally find such a jem  in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great stuff... the regular sized bowl was plenty and ample percentage of fish/protein to the other ingredients in the Hawaiian bowl."}
{"text":"Amazing poke!  We also bought scallops to go- cooked them and they were also amazing.  Fresh fish brought in every couple of days from San Diego- never frozen.  Really, really yummy."}
{"text":"This place was my exciting adventure for Thursday dinner. Me a fellow aficionado of Ahipoke (down the road) decided to make a date of exploring Chula Seafood to compare.  Mission accomplished!!  If you've never had poke, I'd start here.  Unfortunately, you'll probably end here too as their fish and sauces and vegetables are so fresh that anything else might be a step down.  I had the Thai peanut, and he had the Hawaiian bowl.  The flavors are fresh and delicious, you can really tell the fish is flown in everyday.  Our comparison notes agreed that Ahipoke is larger quantity and more chipotle style, but hands down Chula wins in the freshness. And to be fair, their portions are generous for a meal.   Since I'm an incessant question asker, we found out that the operator's family does all the fishing themselves from their boat which runs San Diego to Mexico. They also serve as a fish market, and I'll be back this weekend to purchase and explore a new recipe with their scallops which look amazing. Prices are fair for fresh caught seafood, I think a bit cheaper than AJs or Whole Foods though.   I'll keep you posted on my visits here. This won't be the last :-)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! I will have to come here once a week now. food was so fresh and the flavor was out of bounds. found a new favorite poke bowl place"}
{"text":"I kind of hate to post this review because the restaurant feels a bit like an insider, hidden gem. Nowhere location, unassuming storefront, no marketing that I've seen. But this place is seriously good and deserves kudos.   Fresh seafood, great combinations, well-thought-out menu, and a kind of competent, cool, no-fuss service that I miss from NY (even though these guys are soooo not New Yorkers). My favorite is the sweet and sour salmon, which is fantastic if you like your savory with more than a dash of sweet. And the texture and taste of the rice is terrific too.  We make the schlep out there almost every week, an hour round-trip. That's how good it is."}
{"text":"This place just stole the #1 spot for my favorite Tuna Sandwich.  The accompanying side salad and vinaigrette dressing is awesome.  My takeout meal came in a 9\" X 9\" container that was completely filled.  Killer service and attitude.  Very cool spot, and highly recommended."}
{"text":"What is this MAGICAL place?! Seriously. Upon entering I was treated with a big ol' smile from Hogan, I ordered the Hawaiian Bowl and an iced green tea. My order was brought out almost immediately and they upsized me to a large since there was some sort of miss order before me. I am thanking my lucky stars that happened, even though the regular size would have been sufficient (cause I'm stuffed now) it was so dang delicious that I was stoked to get the larger one! Yellow fin is my favorite and I haven't had great yellow fin like that since I was last in Florida!!! The price was really reasonable for the quality and quantity. Every time I am near this area it will be my go to spot! I can't want to bring friends here that are visiting from out of town too! Thank y'all for the great service and even better food!"}
{"text":"The very BEST poke bowl EVER!!  It's the place where you're planning what you want to try next time while you're still eating!"}
{"text":"Best poke bowl that I've ever eaten - even better than in Maui! I wish I could eat here every day, but sadly I live too far away. It will now be my go-to when I visit Phoenix!   We loved the ceviche, which was unlike any other - with acorn squash and Peruvian corn. I'll forever dream about the Hawaiian bowl and my hubby, who is a big fan of pad Thai, loved the Thai peanut noodle bowl. We took fresh ahi and salmon home for dinner and made sushi ourselves with delicious results.   The owners were so friendly and helpful. This place is a hidden gem and we can't wait to visit again soon!!!"}
{"text":"The best/freshest poke in town (not another chained store). I don't mind paying a few dollars more for this higher-quality poke bowl. We will definitely come back for more!  Update: We brought the whole family here today and everyone loved it! Same solid high quality sashimi! Yum!"}
{"text":"Fabulous and Fresh!   Hands-down the freshest poke you will find in the valley. I had the  Hawaiian poke bowl,  and you can really taste the quality. If you are tired of subpar raw fish definitely come to Chulas  The best item I had a chance to experience was the tuna sandwich. It's not your typical lunch menu tuna sandwich; there is a nice  piece of tuna in between noble bread country loaf layered with avocado and some sort of aioli spread.  This place is perfect for lunch and I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Seriously I am so impressed with this place. The quality of the fish is unreal. They fly it fresh every single day and the fish is never frozen. They have specials on Sunday for their bagel and lox. The poke bowl is amazing as well. I had the smoked salmon bowl which was absolutely amazing, spicy, and fresh. I always love making sushi and cooking with fish so l will for sure be buying my fish here every single time. The price is very negotiable for the quality and quantity of what you get. I'm sure I'm going to be here at least twice a week. This place is amazing and I'm so excited to have found it!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  From the exceptional customer service to the extraordinary poke bowls, they have it all!  These guys haven't missed a beat when it comes to ambiance, targeting local merchants and providing the best fish you would find anywhere in the valley.  We've had the Spicy Tuna and the Thai peanut bowls.  Everything is fresh, healthy and delicious.  Kudos to this team for what you have created!  We will definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Best poke in AZ or should I say SD since that's where the fresh fish comes from every week!  The freshness of the sashimi and the quality of the vegetables in their poke bowls is hands down unbeatable!  The owners (I think) are so enthusiastic that you can tell they are very passionate and proud of their creations.  Each bowl looks artistically crafted with eye-catching colorful, unique, fresh, and crunchy veggies flanking the mouth-watering fish.  I feel over the top about my description but it is truly how I feel about it!  The sad part is the portions are small and my stomach is big.  I added raw scallops to my salmon poke bowl and ended up paying $19 and still hungry.  The glutton I am really needs two bowls.  When I want value, I go for Ahi Poki.  When I want perfection, I'll go to Chula."}
{"text":"The best poke...fresh...delicious...A diamond in the desert!   When another local business owner told me about Chula's I was skeptical about the freshness and the overall package they were telling me about....but MAN am I glad they talked it up so well because I can't stop going back for more!  If you want a poke bowl, sandwich or fresh catch to take home you won't be disappointed with your options.  My absolute faves are the Thai poke bowl and pastrami crusted smoked salmon for later.   There are a million things I can say about Chula's but once you go you'll constantly be craving to go back. It's worth the drive, it's simply worth every single penny and you're taste buds and belly will appreciate it!"}
{"text":"5 outta 5....EAT Here, BUY the seafood to take home. This place is amazing.  It's in a small unsuspecting strip mall & it took me almost a year to try them out. I'm sorry it did. We had an extra large poke bowl of spicy tuna and it was amazing. So fresh and colorful, great balace of flavors and simple ingredients that we're of super quality. I also took some scallops to cook at home that I swear could have been eaten raw they we're so succulent, fresh and tasty. I resturned that next Tuesday at 10 when they opened and I was the 3rd of 5 customers waiting before opening. While we were there they ran out of 3 dishes simply because they are delish and the ingredients are without a doubt fresh. The inside decore is casual but very cute. You almost forget you're landlocked in the middle of the Sonoran desert. Check them out,you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"When buying fish, there is nothing more reassuring than talking to the guys who caught it less than 24 hours prior. Chula is bringing the ocean to the desert with hands down some of the freshest and best cuts of fish I've ever had. In addition to fish by the pound, they also offer bowls that are thoughtfully created and delicious. I've had a few of them and look forward to trying them all eventually. Being able to dine-in for lunch, and grab some fish to-go for dinner is the best!"}
{"text":"Incredibly exciting to have a super-fresh, creative seafood experience...in land-locked Scottsdale!   On the greatest tip ever from my friend PJ (Outdoor Living Assessments),   we hustled right over to Chula as soon as it opened.  The bowls are PERFECT for a great lunch or light dinner.  We will be making this a weekly visit, but so far The Thai  Peanut Bowl is our delicious \"so fresh it's still flippin''\" favorite.  Great balance of fish, noodles & seasoning - moderately priced. Nice setting, too - serene & clean...everything you'd ask for in a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome place with the freshest seafood you will find in the valley!  I had Thai Peanut bowl and it was delicious!  All of the ingredients in the bowl were so fresh and well prepared.  I also got some fresh Tuna to take home which also turned out to be awesome.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"10 stars. Seriously. So good I went for the first time yesterday and came back again today. The fish is melt in your mouth good. We had the Hawaiian bowl, sweet and sour salmon, and the ginger ponzu salad with yellowfin. All were amazing."}
{"text":"Chula is hands down the freshest, most flavorful and delicious seafood establishment the Phoenix metro area. (Fish is procured directly from the San Diego docks twice weekly.) This South Scottsdale establishment is a must try and once you do, you'll be hooked. Icing on the cake: the staff, chefs and owners are the most down to earth, coolest cats you'll encounter in the local food scene. It's truly a \"third place\" where where like-minded people come together, connecting through a mutual respect and appreciation for clean eating, great company and farm- (or in this case, an ocean)-to-table experience. As an added bonus, it literally is a 1 minute drive to Singh Meadows where you can get all the farm-to-basket veggies to compliment your fresh fish for the week! We can't wait for the new Central and Camelback location to open in Fall 2018 so when we're in the Uptown Plaza area, we can enjoy more of the extraordinary, healthy cuisine we crave."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Flavorful, unique, fresh!!! A must try!!! I only give if 4 stars because of the menu options. Very few choices and I wish they had a bit more."}
{"text":"First-timer.  Just had the Thai tuna poke bowl.  Flavor, texture and freshness made this dish the best bowl I have ever eaten.  Yes. Best ever!  My wife had the spicy tuna bowl and it too was a culinary delight!  We will be regulars at Chula Seafood.  It's wonderful when a place like this not only meets, but far exceeds expectations. And the staff are super-friendly and helpful in explaining all menu choices. Top-notch all around. Bravo!"}
{"text":"So fresh and yummy! I'm so happy there's finally a place in south scottsdale where you can enjoy fresh delicious food!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Chula. I was thrilled to read about this fresh fish market in the paper and immediately signed up for their notifications of What's fresh\" this week. I was planning a dinner party and wanted to serve fish. I drove from SE Chandler to Scottsdale and chose halibut. I must admit that I was shocked at the price. My dinner for 6 ended up very pricy.  However, I am pleased to say that the fish was AWESOME.  My dinner guests loved it.  I'll definitely be back, despite the high prices."}
{"text":"Um....the best. Nothing even comes close to competing with the fresh seafood they have here. I bought fresh halibut from them and grilled it up. It was the best halibut I've ever had anywhere. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic poke shop in Phoenix. The fish was super fresh and the combinations were very tasty. If i lived here I would be coming in here at least once a week! Highly recommend if you want a quick, healthy meal."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. The bowls are amazing - every single one of them.  My favorite is ordering a side of sashimi (pay by the pound) and having them dress it with their spicy sauce. The side of sashimi and bowl usually cost me about $20. Worth every penny. Side note: the owner and employees are so laid back and such nice guys that they make running a mom and pop shop appear simple (don't see that every day). Their success with this enterprise is going to fun to watch as they grow it."}
{"text":"Presentation: Spot on with beautiful detail to each dish as described on the menu. Taste: Amazingly fresh with complimentary spices & flavours to balance out each entrée. It truly was a perfect marriage with each of the three dishes we experienced: spicy tuna; Juan special, & sweet & sour. Great customer service too.  Thank you, Chula Seafood Family!"}
{"text":"High - High Marks !!! I've been here 17 years and have never purchased fresher fish.  They don't mess around.  I bought two different types to grill at home.  Wow !!! You must try !!! They have my confidence and trust now.  I'm a poke fan so I'll be going back to try that.   This is my new hideaway!!!  You cannot touch the freshness."}
{"text":"So excited about this new place, came in for a Poke bowl and was so pleased with the choices and price. I had the Japanese Poke and it was outstanding. Clean shop and polite helpful employees, this place is well worth 5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here because of the yelp reviews and I was disappointed. I had Hawaiian style poke bowl and I was not impressed. On the menu, it says that the bowl has macadamia nut, ginger, garlic, cucumber, radish, pineapple and of course tuna. My bowl had everything except macadamia nut, ginger and garlic, instead I got carrot, daikon and some other kind of radish...it was a bowl of crunch crunch crunch...I am not a fan. The portion was small, $14 for a regular size and it sure did not fill me up. I had to find something else to eat afterwards. I have had better poke at other places. I gave this place two stars because at least, their poke is fresh."}
{"text":"Best and freshest poke/seafood in town. I absolutely love the Thai peanut and sweet and sour salmon bowls. You can easily taste the freshness of the ingredients. You get what you pay for, but I would say you won't be disappointed for the price you pay. I hope this place continues to grow and do well."}
{"text":"honestly rarely write reviews on here, pretty lazy and think yelp is overall kind of lame...I've only been here twice, but I think it might be the best lunch spot in the valley; they've absolutely knocked it out of the park both times! you do have to like fresh, raw fish. The atmosphere, staff and overall cleanliness of Chula are all insanely good, not the most inexpensive place in town, but worth every penny and more if you ask me. Went there for lunch today and won't be surprised if I'm back tomorrow...it's that great"}
{"text":"Went in thinking we would buy tuna to make poke at home but came out with their pre-cut tuna (fresh and wonderful) and their sauce on the side.  Will definitely get the tuna again and make our own sauce.  Best tuna I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker for a casual lunch and was super impressed! The fish is insanely fresh and tasty and the decor was great.   Only con is that it's a little bit pricier and the portions are a little smaller than my old go-to (Ahipoke) that I can't afford to come here too often.  Got the sweet and sour salmon poke which was great but the jalapeño peppers were SO spicy - maybe it should be called the sweet, sour and spicy poke. I tried to pick them out but there were some pesky seeds were hiding and BAM  - bonfire in my mouth :(  Still a great find though! Looking forward to coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great poke place with a California vibe and a Hawaiian taste. I had the spicey tuna with half scallops.  It tasted extremely fresh and was absolutely delicious.  The guys there were very great, very helpful and nice.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Chula Seafood is a small Family Owned and Operated Fishery that specializes in Fresh Sustainable Fish Caught of the Pacific Coast. The specialty fish is the Harpooned Swordfish. They sell several fresh fish choices in mostly 6 oz portions. They also sell locally made artisan foods such as Homeboy's Hot sauce, Noble Bread and other locally made goods.   They offer a limited menu of mostly Poke Bowls, a Tuna Confit Sandwich and on \"Saturdays Only\" a House Smoked Salmon Bagel.  We ordered at the counter and sat ourselves. We shared the Tuna Confit Sandwich and the House Smoke Salmon Bagel. I was surprised that both sandwiches were spicy. Both sandwiches were tasty and both were filled with lots of flavors on very above average breads. The Tuna Confit Sandwich was delicious but the Tuna was dry. I think it was cooked too much or most likely at too high of a temperature but with all the flavors in the sandwich the dryness of the tuna wasn't too noticeable.  We also purchased fresh fish to take home.  Service was exceptional, the man working there was very helpful and thoughtful.  This isn't a fancy place but it seems clean.  Parking is easy and close.  This place is a gem for fresh seafood!"}
{"text":"First visit.  Quality fish.  I was disappointed with the construction of my $18 XL cerviche bowl served in a clear plastic disposable bowl with quinoa as the primary base and garnished with greens, pickled veggies, and slivers of fresh serrano or jalapeño peppers.  The cerviche in my bowl was not sufficiently drained - and thus what I ended up with was a cerviche-topped mushy bowl of quinoa and a 1/2 inch deep pool of cerviche 'juice' pooled at the bottom.  The overpowering 'juice' coated and floated everything in my bowl.  IMHO what these folks should have done, since the cerviche was being served in a bowl over quinoa, is thoroughly drained and redrained the cerviche just before adding it into the bowl.  Would have made a huge (positive) difference.  Serving cerviche in a bowl atop other items requires a different serving technique versus just serving it in a bowl by itself.  Maybe I'm being too harsh - but that seems simple and obvious to me.  My dining companion tried the spicy tuna bowl ($14) - and deemed it pretty good though a modest portion of fish for the price.  In any event - these folks are using fresh, high quality ingredients and this level of quality, fresh seafood in these parts is a rare find outside of sushi restaurants.  Budget $15-$20/pp for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is everything! Had the sweet and sour salmon poke. Best poke I've had since Hawaii!"}
{"text":"We ate here today for the first time and it is just delicious. I had the Thai Peanut Poke bowl and it was excellent. A ton of wonderful flavor and loaded with Albacore tuna. The homemade kimchi is absolutely great too! Perfect flavor and perfect spice. I'm a big eater but with the noodles in this bowl it is very filling. I left very satisfied.  My wife had the Salmon Bagel that is available on Saturday only. It was just delicious, they don't use lox like a traditional style bagel, they use smoked, chunked salmon. It was so good that we got two more of them to go to eat later. We commented to the owner how good the actual bagel itself was and he told us they get their bagels from the small, family owned bakery called Super Chunk. He also recommended that we try them, so we did. I'll make that a separate review but WOW! They are awesome too!  Today was great! We found two family owned places and they are both great. We can't wait to back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere what more can be said. Fish is from a sustainable fish farm and is as fresh as you can get it besides fishing it yourself."}
{"text":"Best place for Poke bowls in AZ hands down. Fresh and delicious!!! The sweet and sour salmon is my favorite."}
{"text":"Definitely don't lump this into the same category as all of those other \"Poke\" places that have been springing up all over town.  Sure they offer that venerable dish but there is also so much more.  They bring in some of the freshest seafood in town and they execute with a creativity and precision that is normally reserved for the $$$ type places.  Their passion and quality equals some of the best sub $20 seafood you'll ever experience."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure!!!!!  I love it!!!  You walk in thinking should I be eating here????  Have faith in the reviews!!!  This fish is so fresh!!!!  The albacore tuna sandwich is the freshest, best, tuna sandwich I have ever had!  My daughter had the Thai poke yummy!!!  Ask for extra sauce. My Big had the Ginger Ponzi with albacore because they were out of yellowtail. YUM!!!  We also tried the potato salad....very good!  Coming back Saturday to pick up fresh fish for a dinner party! Love!"}
{"text":"A bit out of the way, but so worth it. I got the Hawaiian poke bowl. Fresh, filling, and delicious. A bunch of tuna with great veggies and not a ton of rice. Not assembly line poke, but made for me.  You could taste the difference.   This is not a poke place, rather it's a seafood market with great poke. Fresh fish in Phoenix to go, it's a beautiful thing. They had 8 different seafood options in the case, and they looked great. I'll be back tomorrow to bring some fillets home. Really nice people running this spot to book."}
{"text":"What a find! We discovered Chula as a place to buy incredibly fresh seafood to bring home to cook. They also have a wide variety of poke and ceviche bowls. And super friendly counter staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Don't ya hate how you have to go to San Diego every time you want fresh seafood? No worries now because Chula's gets their fresh seafood from San Diego! I had the Hawaiian poké bowl. It was a dream. I could eat it every day!"}
{"text":"The hype is so justified here. This is some of the best stuff I've eaten in a while. Even non seafood lovers who I've brought here are hooked on the poke bowls. The fish is so fresh that there isn't even a hint of \"fishiness.\" I can't wait for their Uptown Plaza location to open. Like so many places in Phoenix right now this is a hidden gem in a dumpy strip mall. Everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I call in and pick up dinner here at least once a week... their seafood is potentially the freshest tasting seafood I have ever had. All of their bowls have so much flavor and fresh ingredients... it's always difficult to choose which one I want to eat (although usually comes down to the Thai Peanut Noodle or the Hawaiian Poke). I even gave the Mac salad a chance- thinking the idea of \"spam\" to be gross- and now pick that up every week when I'm in there (if they have it on hand). Check this place out- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Chula exceeded all expectations. We just got to town for the weekend for a wedding and were looking for a delicious healthy lunch spot. We love poke and all things Hawaiian-this place is fresh, authentic, and has sick basil mint limeade."}
{"text":"Chula is located in a small strip center at the corner of Hayden and Roosevelt. The visibility from the road is virtually zero. So if you are just driving by the chances are good that you will not see it.  Nonetheless it had been on my radar for sometime now. I have been driving by it on Hayden for almost two years and yesterday I stopped in.  Yes I was angry at myself for having taken so long to check this place out.  It's a combination fish market and restaurant. A fairly appealing assortment of fresh fish for those who would prepare their meal themselves.  I chose the Spicy Tuna bowl. It was sublime. I ordered the extra large portion and it was more than a full meal. But what was great was how delicious it was. Almost six ounces of tuna sitting atop rice, seared green peppers, slices of avocado and a variety of other accompaniments.  The service at the counter was very friendly and the gentleman taking your order and money brings your order and addresses you by your name.  I will be going back to check out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"By far the best fish sandwich I ever had, it was amazing. Truly bump into it by accident. Highly recommended. A must do in Arizona."}
{"text":"Chula Seafood... where do I start. The seafood is fresher than fresh. I ordered the Hawaiian poke bowl and for a brief moment I felt an ocean breeze fly through the room. The ahi tuna was so fresh it was still swimming in the bowl. 12 out of 10 highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent    Dropped in from out of town.  Loved the management and guidance for food selection.  Definite do not miss this spot!!"}
{"text":"BEST poke bowls. Best. Fresh fresh seafood and the poke bowls are the best you will have.  We have picked up some fresh fish and cooked it at home and the fish is the best you can get in the valley. I really enjoyed the tuna confit sandwich on Noble bread, but the star of the show is the poke bowl. I have tried them all and they are fantastic."}
{"text":"Freshest seafood ever in Arizona! Finally I got to try for the first time after bookmarked this place 6 months ago. Why did I wait so long!  Tuna used in Hawaiian style poké was so fresh, never been frozen. In fact all the seafood they sell here is fresh, never been frozen.  I really liked their slightly spicy tuna, all the fresh sides they served in the bowl, I kept glancing at the menu to see what I can order next.  Staff is very friendly and professional. They really do care about their customers. Nice and simple decor. Very clean inside.  They sell seafood here too. Next time when I want to eat sashimi or serve poké at a party, I know where to go."}
{"text":"I visited Chula Seafood for the first time today. The guy behind the fish display was friendly and informative.  They have their own fishing boat in California waters, and harpoon swordfish for the restaurants. Harpooning swordfish is actually more sustainable than using nets, which may capture and kill species that are not intended for the table. I ordered the Thai peanut bowl, which has sushi grade albacore, rice noodles, carrots, radish, peanuts, sesame seeds, sweet peppers, all with a creamy, mildly spicy sauce. It turned out to be a tasty combination that I enjoyed, and I look forward to trying the spicy tuna bowl and the Hawaiian poke bowl. Check out the online menu and see if they have something that appeals to you. Please note that they are open Weds. through Sun."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to buy some super fresh fish to take away and grill at home or enjoy at their restaurant.  I went with their Thai peanut bowl which was delicious.  Plenty of tuna and other mildly spicy ingredients in a bowl with soba noodles.  $12 dollars was a very fair price given the quality of the ingredients.  The owner, John, was very friendly and helpful.  I can't wait to try some of the other menu items and their upcoming special dining events."}
{"text":"The FRESH catch...Yes, FRESH catch seafood is the BEST in the entire Metro Phoenix area. The Spicy Tuna and Spicy Thai bowl will ROCK your WORLD.  Chef Juan's FEATURE will teach you what TREAT YOURSELF means! WOW! Friendly... Courteous....FUN! Thanks for making our dining experiences foodie fantasy! Scott and Angela"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The selection is always incredible and fresh. Fresher than some sushi places in the valley. They have a special thing going here."}
{"text":"A-maz-ing lunch!  It is tucked away in this strip mall, you might miss it if you weren't looking.   My lunch buddy suggest this place for lunch today and I am so glad!!!  I had the Ginger Ponzu Salad... every bite was delicious and the yellowfin tuna was so fresh and there was A LOT of it with just enough vinaigrette for flavor.  I also had the cold brew Thai style coffee just perfectly sweeten.  The place is clean and stylish, love the chalkboard menu.  The staff was very helpful and provided all round great service.  If you are in the neighborhood stop by you will not be disappointed.  This is going on to the top of our places to luncheon list!!"}
{"text":"Ok, Chula- you caught my attention at the UnderTow/Chula pop-up. Can't wait to visit your place in Scottsdale to see what other gems you are serving up. :-)"}
{"text":"What a great find!  If you like fresh fish - this is the place to go. I had the Thai Peanut Bowl with Albacore Tuna. It was incredibly fresh and very flavorful. My husband had the Tuna Melt with green chilies. Super flavorful and yummy!  If you are looking for some super fresh fish, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Freaking Amazing!!! I ordered the Hawaiian poke and everyone is right! The quality is unbelievably good. This is the place to go for fresh fish in Arizona.  The gentleman working there were very helpful and friendly. Even offered a few samples to help me make up my mind. I will absolutely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Everything is first rate. I had the spicy tuna bowl, and I wouldn't change a thing about it. My wife had the Thai peanut noodle bowl and substituted smoked salmon for the tuna. It was also delicious. Looking forward to the smoked salmon bagel tomorrow. It's that good."}
{"text":"Best. Salmon. Bagel. Ever. Fresh salmon from San Diego then smoked and served. Pickled onion and jalapeño, capers, cream cheese, cucumber, and the best bagel everything bagel you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Beautiful fishes! The crew is super nice and helpful with suggestions on how to dish it up."}
{"text":"This place has really great food. Definitely on the pricier side, what you also get what you pay for. It's not like Ahipoke or Pokedon where you 'make it yourself' The menu is small but they do it right. I usually come here every Saturday morning to get the salmon bagel and the tuna confit sandwich. YUM! I can't explain it. I've also tried the sweet and sour salmon poke which is also one of my favorites. Pretty spicy too, which I absolutely love. Definitely skip the crispy mac salad, nothing to rave about. The ginger ponzu salad was ok but I think there was just too much acidity in it, it hurt my mouth. But honestly, get the tuna confit sandwich, so noms!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just picked up some fresh swordfish for the grill and it was so amazing. Simple with a mixed peppercorn butter.  Also bought some noble bread from them for a panzanella and that was great.  If you like to cook seafood, make this place your go to fish market. Fresh noble bread Wednesday and fridays. Wide selection of poke bowls with unique ingredients. If you like your fish cooked the have an amazing tuna sandwich made with toasted noble bread and a confit tuna that has been poached/cooked in infused I love oil and is tender and flaky and has an amazing bright fresh flavor.  I hate to share a good find (selfish me :)), but this place is a gem that I can't keep to myself!"}
{"text":"As fans know, this place has been around for several months and Peg and I just heard about it recently through Keenan Bosworth....a talented chef who knows his way around the industry and is incredible in his own right. When others also recommended it....Bernie Kantak, Jacob Cutino, Donnie Hawk, and Brent Kille...it becomes a complete mandate! We had the Hawaiian Style Poke, Thai Peanut, and Confit Tuna Sandwich in our usual over-ordering-can-we-taste-it-all sort of mentality. Oh yeah...the mac and spam salad (Hawaiian influence, natch) was playfully delicious. Hogan guided us through the menu and it is clear that his passion is infectious. You know that anywhere that features Jacob's Juice (Homeboy's Hot sauce) and Noble Bread is already high on the list and the freshest of seafood (brought in twice a week from San Diego). The preparation by Chef Juan is simply superb....simply allowing the freshest of ingredients to marry together. This will be a delightful go-back!  Thanks again,  Chefs!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"I'll start with the only negative. I didn't know this place existed when I lived 10 minutes away. Now I live 30.   Food is fresh and delicious. Saturday morning they have a great smoked salmon bagel special that they usually run out of by 1pm. I'll have to make a special trip back for that.   I've been here a handful of times and tried a handful of the bowls. All were delicious. They house made limeade was lovely. Service was great. Location was clean. Honestly what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fabulous. Like culinary, top grade fabulous. If you enjoy fish as a delicacy and all the flavors that make it even better, this is the best I have had. It's nothing like the Poke places popping up everywhere. Not discounting those places, this is just different. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Hawaiian poke bowl with some extra touches including macadamia nuts. Large portion as well. It's a random strip mall location but beautiful inside with clean,simple lines. The fresh seafood including huge shrimp and scallops for purchase looked excellent."}
{"text":"Always soooo good and fresh! One word... Crave-able!!!  The food is as beautifully it is fresh and delicious. The smoked swordfish and tuna poke is Amazing"}
{"text":"THE best and freshest seafood in town.  My husband has been bringing home their seafood for dinner and we eat it sashimi style... it's that fresh!  Today I was excited to finally try their lunch menu and eat at the restaurant.  Not surprising how delicious it was!  So excited to come back for more!  If you love seafood, this is your go-to place!"}
{"text":"friendly fast suberb service and food I changed my mind once I order no problem or attitude guy at counter was amazing a bit pricey for poki but food is great and worth the quality and price you pay"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  Fish so fresh and tasty.  Owners and employees super knowledgeable and helpful!  Always an awesome experience here.  I dream about the smoked pastrami salmon."}
{"text":"Best poke ever! I had the spicy tuna to go. You could definitely tell the fish was fresh! There was actually a little heat for taste as well but not overwhelmingly spicy. This is by far the best spicy tuna poke I've ever had. Usually poke places will ground/mince it to a mush which can be unappealing for texture. They cut it in thin small strips here. I love the mushroom and shishito peppers they put in there as well. A very well balanced flavorful dish! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Walking you think you are in a San Diego fish shop right on the beach. Owners are extremely nice, asked Jon one of the owners what he recommended and mentioned to me the Crazy Scallop bowl with avocado, salmon eggs, shishitto peppers and a lot of great paired veggies with some amazing scallops that he had put a light spicy mayo dressing on. You could instantly tell the scallops where fresh cause they melted. I've been to a lot of poke places but this place is up there with some of the best of them. It's hard to get quality fish in the valley and you can tell this place does it. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The customer service can't be matched and everything on the menu is incredible. The menu is simple so you can't make a bad choice. It's the only place in az you can get real seafood. Everyone who visits me is guaranteed a stop at chulas. You'll notice when you go everyone is a raving fan. No one leaves chulas unhappy."}
{"text":"Put this place on your short list. Fresh fish from San Diego caught on their own boat. Food is fresh and delicious. The people were personable and very helpful. Love this place."}
{"text":"The only reason why we went here is because of their 5 stars. I'm not exactly sure why everyone loves it. There was hair on my fruit, the sandwich has way too much pepper and did not taste good at all, and the service was not great (not horrible, but far from good). Also it was way over priced. $20 per person is a little pushing it for bad food in a horrible location."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been using Chula Seafood for our catering company for a little over a year. As a chef, I can't express how difficult it is to get great seafood in a landlocked state. Chula delivers some of the best cuts I've seen! Hands down. Amazing!"}
{"text":"By far the best Fish and Poke Bowl in the Valley.  By far."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend.  Only downside I think is I need to eat two bowls.  Very healthy stuff."}
{"text":"So good and the guys seem to be really into what they're doing.   Had a poke bowl, Thai peanut bowl and a ceviche and they were all ridiculous. Everything was so fresh and vibrant tasting. All 6 or 7 elements of the dishes worked perfectly together.  I will be here often."}
{"text":"Freshest seafood in Arizona! Try the Hawaiian style poke.  Amazing! Blackened swordfish is unreal. Seriously........ why even go anywhere else!  You can get meals for the family to go.  Dine in! Get extremely fresh to make at home. 100% you try it once you will be family forever. Thanks Team Chula."}
{"text":"FRESH. We made it! On a stormy evening, I was able to sit outside and observe the stunning monsoon rains and winds. There are two tables outside and my dinner companion and I sat at one of them. The man working the counter said we were the first people to sit outside in months. We were excited to try some poké here and ordered the Thai peanut bowl and the Hawaiian style poké bowl. I noticed most people were coming in and ordering their wholesale fresh seafood to go, which they are well-known for.  It was nice to be able to split two bowls as they were totally different in size, taste and texture. I preferred the Hawaiian one, which had yellowfin tuna, cucumber, carrot, radish, mango, macadamia nut, onion, edamame, soy, sesame, ginger, garlic, all on top of rice. Phew! It was so tasty and needed nothing extra. I could've done without the radishes though. The Thai peanut had rice noodles instead of rice as well as albacore tuna, carrot, scallion, radish, cucumber, sweet pepper, house kimchi, sesame, thai basil, mint and cilantro. This was a good bowl but I expected the noodles to be softer. Still, an excellent mix of flavors and we each had one as our favorite. All in all, a superb place to come eat and I still want to come on a Saturday when they have their smoked salmon bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for poke in town! I had the poke bowl there and I could not get poke from anywhere else anymore. I also had ceviche bowl and the fish is so fresh like it just came from the ocean. The location is convenience for me with lots of parking space. I am glad that we have very fresh and quality seafood available for us in the desert."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Hawaii I had all but given up on the idea of finding great poke when I moved to to a landlocked state on the Mainland.   I went into this place with low expectations and needless to say they were thoroughly destroyed. This place is legit folks... LEGIT. In Hawaii or California this place would hold its own with against other poke spots, in Arizona it's not even a contest. This place is so far above anything else around it's not even funny.   So far I've had the Hawaiian Style ahi, Thai Peanut and Spicy Tuna poke bowls. Each one was delicious and different enough from the others to warrant trying them all. The fish isn't frozen and you can tell when you take a bite- texture and taste are fresh and just perfect.   I've also tried the Salmon Bagel and Confit Tuna Sandwich, both of which were served on local breads which is cool.  You can tell the guys that run this place really care about what they do and are passionate about their fish. They are always helpful and willing to offer recipes and cooking suggestions for any fish they happen to have that day."}
{"text":"Greetings! I recently undertook a diet by which I lost over 60 pounds in 12 months. Needless to say, my dietary requirements have drastically changed as a result, and I avoid restaurants as a general rule, because of their large portions. But the true mark of a good eatery is their ability to work with a customer and adapt to his requests.  I had a couple hours to kill between events at church, and so I resolved to hang out in an air-conditioned restaurant. Since I was eating no meat on that day, I visited Chula with their delicious fresh fish in mind. I approached the gentleman at the counter and first queried whether he could just make me a fillet of something on display. He said no, this fish was for home preparation only. I can understand that. So I asked what else could be done. He unhelpfully directed me back to the chalkboard menu. Now I love pokebowls and the other items on the menu, but their portions are huge, and even the small-sized offerings began at about $12. There were two \"Children's Menu\" items; one was basically mac-and-cheese: very non-nutritious, not fish at all. As I refused everything on the menu, the gentleman indicated that there was nothing else to be done for me, and so I left hungry.  So this is a lesson to me personally. Not every place can be accommodating for a simple dietary requirement such as small portions. Perhaps I could call ahead more often to test the waters. But I am committed to my diet, and I am dismayed that this epidemic of sheer unadulterated gluttony in these USA has this kind of effect on restauranteurs."}
{"text":"The hype is real! The best value on an incredible, creative and fresh seafood meal in the area. The staff is super friendly, helpful and just all around classy. I'd eat here every day if I could. I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle, we are very particular about our fresh seafood. Hands down, this is the best poke bowl place we have found in Arizona. We got the Thai peanut bowl and the Hawaiian poke bowl. We also got the smoked salmon bagel which was amazing. One of the best everything bagels we have ever had. We will definitely be back to this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've been reading all the great press about Chula Seafood for a few months now and finally got to try it. I'm officially in love. It's a fresh seafood oasis in the desert! The restaurant itself is in a nondescript little strip mall, but the inside is cute and cozy. It's a small space with about 8 tables inside and 2 outside on the sidewalk.  It's a walk up and order type of place, and the staff are really helpful and knowledgeable. We tried the Hawaiian poke bowl and the daily special, which was a pastrami smoked salmon sandwich. The poke bowl had the freshest tuna in an amazing sesame soy sauce, edamame, cucumber, pineapple and more on top of white rice. It was seriously the best poke I've ever had. Poke bars are so popular now, and this put them all to shame. The pastrami smoked salmon was great too. The pastrami spices paired perfectly with the smoky, flaky salmon. It was served on a soft roll with coleslaw and pickles. The poke bowl was our favorite, and I'm already craving it again.  If you feel like cooking, they also have a  seafood counter. You can take home everything from fresh scallops and a variety of fish, to smoked seafood."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten somewhere and took a first bite that was so good, that I felt compelled to tell the world to stop what they are doing right now and come eat at this restaurant.  This. Is. It.  Fish this fresh and dressed to perfection in poke form in the desert?  Unheard of until now!  We got the Tuna Confit sandwich, served on  Noble bread and brilliantly topped with a cripsy house made gardineria.  The flavors were perfectly bright and citrusy.  The Hawaiian poke bowl was a rainbow of super fresh veggies; no filler veggies here!  The short-grained rice was perfeclty cooked.  The tuna was so fresh, the texture was unreal.  The dressing did not overwhelm and packed plenty of flavor.  The balance of all these flavors together was unbelievable.  Next time, we will get here earlier to try the Saturday smoked salmon sandwich.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch! Everything was very fresh and flavorful. Service was very friendly. We had the Hawaiian Poke and Thai noodles. Both were excellent. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Stunningly Beautiful Seafood they way it should be. I was over joyed in finding this place.  The POKE is excellent and done in a bowl with lots of healthy ingredients. I took a special friend and she loved it, which really surprised me. I've had 2 different bowls so far along with the Mint Basil Limeade and some Smoked Salmon. I couldn't have been happier if I'd caught the fish myself. The staff is wonderful and very accommodating. You can't go wrong eating here if you want fantastic, healthy food with lots of wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"I work just down from the road from this place and had no idea it existed till I found it on yelp. I agree with the others this place has fabulous food. Small location with a limited menu but it is fresh and delicious. I will absolutely be returning next week. I had the thai peanut with amazing tuna, my friend had the spicy tuna bowl . We both LOVED it!"}
{"text":"AWESOME little seafood market / restaurant that just opened in our neighborhood. The food was super fresh and had great flavors. Reminded us of being in Hawaii and eating fresh seafood and poke bowls. We will definitely be regulars!  We had the Hawaii Poke bowl and the tuna was like butter. My husband is from Hawaii and said the poke was as good as it gets. Also tried the Thai Peanut Bowl which was excellent. We bought fresh scallops to cook for dinner tonight and will be going back for the swordfish and to try everything else on the menu.   This place is a must for anyone who appreciates fresh seafood and supporting local."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing. The fish is so fresh! Growing up on the California coast I missed great seafood since I've lived here and I just found it! Highly recommend this place. I had the ponzu yellowfin salad, it was perfect. We ordered pastrami smoked salmon to go and had it over bagels this morning A+++! Definitely will be back. Thank you Chula!"}
{"text":"Had the Thai tuna bowl. Top notch. So fresh. The homemade Kim chi in it had quite the kick!"}
{"text":"Originally came in for the salmon bagel (wrong day) but we ended up having an early lunch and had the Hawaiian bowl it was delicious! The fish they had looked super fresh. The place was so neat and clean. The guys were super friendly and nice! We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Review 8/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  Chula: 1. Sexy, fine 2. Gorgeous 3. Cool, feminine form of chulo (From Urban Dictionary).   Hello sexy gorgeous cool seafood!  Hey, a fish market that doesn't smell fishy! The store is spacious, sparkling clean, and holds the freshest seafood you'll find in Arizona. When I walked in I was greeted warmly and one of the family members that runs this shop introduced himself to me. He went over the menu and their fresh fish selections for the day. Everything sounded so good I wanted one of each off the menu! Feeling a bit tropical today, I ended up with the Hawaiian poke bowl ($14) and a lime Arnie ($4). It was made in record time and the poke bowl was a beautiful sight to behold. My first thought was \"Perfection!\" and indeed every element was carefully prepared and compiled together for my bowl. The colors were intense and jewel-like, from the deep rich red of the tuna to the bright kaleidoscope of thinly sliced orange carrot, purple carrot, pink radish and cucumber, the light green edamame, and the brightly yellow mango. Unlike other poke that I've had where the pieces can be thick and unevenly cut, the tuna was cut into perfect cubes and I admired the chef's knife skills with not just the fish but with the sliced vegetables. All these ingredients were perched on a bed of short grain rice.   The marinade on the poke was simple: soy sauce and thinly sliced onion. There was a dusting of sesame seed and a sprinkle of crushed macadamia nut on top. While the tuna was leaning more towards the super salty side for me all the crisp vegetables and the rice helped disperse the concentrated flavor of the fish. The tuna itself was superb. It had a clean pure flavor.  The lime Arnie was super tangy and zesty. It was made with a mix of green tea and limeade.   Their fresh fish and seafood selection looked delectable and I will have to go here again to get some of their seafood by the pound. They can even do special orders for you, and can procure delights such as abalone and spot prawns if they are given notice in advance!  The actual shop is in a faded looking shopping plaza next to a martial arts academy.   Overall I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the food, and also the friendliness of everyone working here. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the product they sell."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The restaurant space was clean and simply decorated. I was undecided between the Hawaii Poke bowl and the Thai Peanut bowl but the staff left me sample a bit of the yellowfin and a bit of the albacore. We decided to go with XL Thai Peanut bowl based on the albacore. The noodles were great BUT the bowl was too spicy for our taste. I wish the description mentioned how spicy it was! Other than that, our overall experience was fantastic.   On a side note: the fish are all sustainably sourced but the restaurant only uses plastic bowls and plastic ware without any recycle stations. Hopefully Chula Seafood can move toward a more environmentally friendly dining option."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh fish and great selection!! Best poke bowl around!"}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like you're not in the desert anymore. The staff is wonderful and the food is even better. I got the Hawaiian style poke and I must say it is fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"Their Saturday smoked salmon bagel is one of the tastiest combos I've had. Love love. Get there early!"}
{"text":"As of recent, there has been a lot of poke shops popping up everywhere in the valley. Sure, it isn't as fresh or the same as in Hawaii or back home in California but I'm still obsessed. My coworker was raving over Chula Seafood for quite some time and said if I loved poke (or seafood in general), I should stop settling at other spots and give this one a go. The verdict? It's amazing. Chula Seafood, you've won me over. All of their seafood is fresh and high quality. There hasn't been an item on their menu or the special of the day that I haven't loved (or completely obsess over). My all time favorite is their spicy tuna bowl. I love that each of their bowls is crafted specifically and are made as ordered. It isn't like other places where you build your own. I haven't gotten any fresh seafood from their case, but I'm looking forward to when I need it knowing that everything is as fresh as it can get.   PSA: They're also on Instagram so you can find out their special of the day!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fresh fish, friendly patrons, overall a 5 star experience. If you love Poke Bowl, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best Yelp finds in all my travels.  Crazy cool spot.  Fish stop that served fantastic fresh seafood entrees. Wish I was going to be in town longer, I'd be back again.  Poke bowl pic attached. Wow!!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh poke bowls!  Located in a strip mall, but don't be fooled by the outside appearance.  The poke is top notch and the staff is friendly.  If you want beer or wine, you'll have to bring your own as they do not serve alcohol.  My favorite is the Thai peanut bowl...amazing."}
{"text":"Some of the best fresh fish we've ever had. This place is \"family-owned and operated, sustainable seafood that is never frozen \". Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We had the Spicy Tuna bowl and the Thai Peanut bowl. The fish and other components were fresh and delicious. The quality of the fish is the real star of the show! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They came to Devils' Ball at Maya with a booth and oh my GOD they were good. I think I had around 10-12 small plates of their delicious seared tuna plate but since it was dark I couldn't tell what I was eating but it was amazing.   It tasted like it had capers, aioli, onions, with some sort of a sesame crisp on top but the quality of the fish was unbelievable. Thanks for taking that party to another level.  I can't wait to visit this place in person and order everything."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Freshest sustainable fish market in town.  The poke bowls are incredible and the owner and crew are great.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My Thursday afternoon was just made by the delicious grub and awesome staff here at Chula. The Hawaiian style poke is killer and you get super laid back and friendly \"service\". I mean I don't even really want to call it \"service\", not because they don't do an amazing job, but because to me at least, it just feels more like I'm at a buddy's place.  They take good care of you here, and the food is no joke-pop into the little nondescript shopping center and make your mouth happy. Thanks Chula- you guys rock"}
{"text":"I wish I hadn't eaten it all so I could include a picture of the salmon bowl in all its glory.  It's definitely got a kick to it, the seasoning hits the spot and does not confuse you with additional bells and whistles.  Chances are if you go to a chipotle style bowl place you will make a monstrosity. By removing user error, this place shows the way to a balanced bowl without too much fuss."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh seafood in the middle of the desert, this is the place. Good portions, awesome customer service, and great food."}
{"text":"Definitely the best poke bowl I have ever had!  The ingredients are fresh and super delicious.  I have only been four times and I am addicted for life!!!"}
{"text":"Pricey and marginal. Great marketing to get customers, but poor delivery on final product."}
{"text":"I lived around 3 minutes from Chula Seafood for over a year, but had no idea that it existed until now. It's located in a small unassuming plaza on Hayden and Roosevelt, about a 10 minute drive south east of old town Scottsdale or slightly north of Tempe marketplace. It's a strange location (in between a liquor store and a pho restaurant) and really hard to see, but all in all worth the scavenging. Now before I get knocked for not giving it the full 5 stars I will start by saying that the seafood quality is as fresh as everyone says and thinks it is (which is hard to come by in the middle of Arizona.  As one can see in the pictures they have a changing fresh menu written up on a chalkboard and first impressions were good. Though small, every single table was filled with people constantly leaving and standing in line. The employees were respectful and very kind, taking their time with each customer. I would caution people on a time crunch to come either before or after the lunch rush hits because with a customer base/popularity like that you're not getting in and out unless you want it as take out which I never recommend for fresh seafood anyways.  The food: I had the Hawaiian poke ($14 for the regular and $18 for the XL). To be honest I would have tried something else, but I feel like to understand a restaurant you should have one of their more generic popular dishes. My specific bowl came with tuna, radishes, edamame, pineapple, some nuts, onions, as well as their (I call it) vinaigrette over rice. The fish was great as expected, and the balance of all the flavors and textures worked very well with each other; however, it also came with sliced raw carrots. I didn't quite understand the idea behind that because I felt like the strong carrot taste pushed the other flavors away. The main reason for the imperfect score is that the poke itself didn't stand out from other poke bowls. Any other poke restaurant can build the same flavor profile with the same ingredients, it's just that this place happened to have better seafood. I know... what is this guy talking about? Long story short if I were basing it on the seafood alone (for example sashimi) this would have a perfect 5 out of 5, but since I got the bowl it falls short of being AMAZING.  As a person who also works in the industry I appreciate the local connections that they have/support I.e. Noble Bread and Homeboys. I also appreciate the quality and care these guys have towards their seafood. Some of the fish they were selling seemed a little pricy from what I've seen, but hey market prices are constantly changing so that's not a big deal."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Fresh fish all the way !! The vegetables are fresh and the seasoning is perfect.  If you enjoy Poke this place is it !!  I can't wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"As I was on my way to go to a different restaurant I was waiting at the stoplight by my house on Roosevelt and pulled up Yelp and noticed that this place was right next to my face!!! I instantly saw the amazing reviews and figured this would be a healthy and interesting place to try (vs the mexican food i was going to get). I was greeted by friendly man who walked me through the whole menu and explained everything in detail to me, i was immediately intrigued and ready to eat. I got the Spicy Tuna Bowl and a green tea.  Oh my... the fish was fresh and the whole bowl had so much flavor and it was a perfect portion size. The Tea was also amazing!! They mentioned they made it in house and i wasn't disappointed. I had to take pictures of the menu so i can come back and try them all. The worker did mention that they change their menu every season which is refreshing and always peaks my interest. :)  The only downside is that its too close to my house so i will be having to visit quite often! Darn! lol  On a side note- I went to Ahipoke bowl the day before.... and im never going back there after having this."}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Phoenix and it was a good start to our vacation! We had trouble deciding between the Hawaiian and Thai Peanut bowls, so the staff let us try the different tunas in each... friendly move! We liked the albacore tuna more so we went with the Thai Peanut. The food came out pretty quickly (as you'd expect with poke). The bowl was tasty, but a bit too spicy for me and my wife (and we normally handle spice pretty well). The fish was excellent... fresh flavor with tasty marinade. There wasn't as much kimchi as we were hoping but the noodles were pretty good.   I was a little disappointed that EVERYTHING was plastic and they didn't have a recycling bin available. For a place that makes a claim for \"sustainable\" fish, it seems appropriate to also demonstrate sustainability for the environment."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and was very excited to have a fresh, sustainable, local fish source so close by.  Picked up two cuts of black seabass yesterday, and could not have been more satisfied with the cut and quality.  Will be back often as I see this as the only place I will be buying fresh fish from going forward!"}
{"text":"Best poke bowl in town. Hands down! I am so happy we live right around the corner from here. I take a nice brisk walk and boom...I end up in the front doors of Chula Seafood. I have ordered their Salmon poke bowl and I was amazed on the freshness of every bite. I have tried other poke bowls in the valley, but nothing compares. I have yet to buy their fresh fish selection but everything looks amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here at least weekly before I moved to Houston 2 weeks ago and I miss it already! The most fresh seafood you will have in Phoenix/Scottsdale. I've made scallop ceviche and swordfish steaks at home and it's by far better than any restaurants due to the quality of the fish. It's never frozen and basically caught fresh in California. Get their smoked bagel sandwich on Saturdays, it's amazing! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"What a fabulous shop with fresh fish by the pound and delicious ready to eat options that are healthy and flavorful! Chula Seafood does not have any freezers in this establishment. I had the Hawaiian Poke Bowl and as I finished it, I said to myself, \"now that was something I could eat everyday\"- it was the perfect blend of fresh yellowfin tuna, rice, ginger, onion, garlic, mango, radish, edamame and soy ginger sauce. We went home with just off the boat scallops and sea bass- can't wait to make dinner tonight. I see a bright future for Chula Seafood. They open Wednesday, Oct 25th. See you there soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Super fresh sea food. Ive been there twice and its been great both times. A rare thing to find is toro and not only do they have it but it's at a very reasonable price. Of course the toro is only available if they catch it fresh on one of their many boats....thats right, they catch their own!!!   That's probably why they are only open wed through sat. but i'm just guessing.  Need to go there again."}
{"text":"So good! Dont be deterred by the slightly creepy shopping center. The place is actually very cute and clean inside! The poke bowls and other meal options are amazing. It's not cheap but totally worth it. The fish is so fresh and tasty. I've never bought raw fish from them to cook but I can highly recommend their in-house food. Perfect lunch splurge to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I had a crab cake recipe I was set on trying this week, and I just couldn't stomach using the lump crab they sell in the canned food aisle at the grocery store. Cue Chula. I stopped in and they had EXACTLY what I was searching for. Talk about quality. It was delicious, high quality and everything in there looked fresh as you could ever hope for. I will definitely be back to try some of their menu items, and buy any fresh fish I may need.   The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable also, which is always an added bonus that keeps a new customer coming back. It's an unexpected spot in a small little strip mall, but boy do they deliver! I will recommend Chula for any/all seafood needs to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest poke I've had! The owner drives to California to bring in freshly caught fish each week. You can taste the difference.   Service: Ordered at the counter and the man brought it our table which is standard. What I did appreciate was that he went around the room asking each table how our food was. I told him it was salty, but I'm not sure he heard me. He never responded.   Food: Hawaiian Style Poke Bowl. The pineapple was sweet and the veggies were crisp. Unfortunately, there was just WAY too much soy sauce. I picked off everything in the bowl except for the rice (1/3 of the bowl) which is sad considering it's $14. The pineapple helps with the saltiness but there weren't enough pieces for all the rice. It would've been a perfect mixture of sweet and salty.   Either ask for no soy sauce or less of it in the Hawaiian Style Poke Bowl. I think there might've been soy sauce by the water dispenser so you can adjust how much goes in it.   Definitely worth the visit for fresh seafood and a good meal! I would love to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"Soooo D* GOOOOD!   Back for second time this week!?   Fresh fresh fresh and healthy yummy menu.  WOW!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this hidden gem and it has become an instant favorite. Ive only had the ceviche bowl everytime because its unreal but everything else llooks just as good. Do yourself a favor and come check this place out when you can."}
{"text":"Impossible to improve upon, unless your 17 yr old son  pulls out his wallet and says \"let me get this dad!\"   I'll report back if this ever happens to me!!!  When you walk into the restaurant you're greeting by staff who exhibit warm genuine smiles with enthusiasm for their fare. The restaurant is tastefully decorated, and spotlessly clean. Counter service with a fresh fish offering in case you'd like to make sushi, or another meal at home.  Oh, the food?  \"Kick A!!!\"  Exceptional. Just Terrific. Colorful, pleasing to the eye and palette. Nice combinations of fresh ingredients and offering terrific unique tastes in each bite.   High standards here, and they hit all of them.  If you want to feel welcome: come here  If you want to enjoy fresh food which is uniquely presented: come here  If you want a nicely decorated, spotless environment to enjoy your meal: come here   The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and clearly take ownership in what they do.  We enjoyed our experience here immensely - and wished we didn't so far (2500 miles) away.  We were cruising North to ride motorcycles in the Sedona area, but if we were \"local\" we'd be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"Guys!!! This is an awesome little seafood spot that's much more than meets the eye! We enjoyed an amazing Hawaiian bowl with fresh tuna (caught yesterday in the Pacific), fresh pineapple, edamame, and all kinds of other incredible goodness and then ordered fresh Mahi and tuna fillets to take home for a fantastic grilled feast for dinner later!  There's really no place quite like Chula's that I have found around town.  It's on our list for a weekly lunch spot and take out for fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Q:  What kind of music should you listen to while fishing? A:  Something catchy!  From San Diego, CA straight to Scottsdale, AZ, the fish can only be fresher if it was catapulted 366 miles right into their storefront.  That's right, The Heflin family fished and shipped these fishies right from their boat, Chula, on the Pacific Coast!  In a somnolent plaza on Hayden and Roosevelt sits Chula Seafood.  Enter the door and you'll find yourself in a nautical themed eatery with smiling faces behind the counter.  A greeting, an introduction, and the helpful, \"Let me know if you have any questions\" was given politely.  A Hawaiian Style Poke, Thai Peanut, a Basil & Mint Limeade, and an Iced Tropical Green Tea was ordered.  After lunch, I ordered another Hawaiian Style Poke bowl and a Macaroni Salad with Spam to-go  Here's the break-down:  * Hawaiian Style Poke ($14): Dainty cubes of yellowfin tuna mixed heavily with soy, thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, watermelon radishes, pineapple, onions, edamame, macadamia nut, ginger, and garlic topped with sesame seeds and served on top rice.  All the interesting textures and flavors unify into a satisfying dish.  No modified or red-dyed tuna here, folks.  This is fresh tuna and it's delicious and clean.  The pineapple was a welcoming burst of bright flavor while the veggies gave it a nice crispness and the macadamia nut made things crunchy.  There was great balance here in this bowl!   * Thai Peanut ($12):  Perfectly cut cubes of albacore tuna mixed aggressively in peanut sauce and topped with carrots, scallions, radishes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, house kimchi, and topped with sesame, Thai basil, mint, and cilantro on top of rice noodles.  The peanut sauce they used reminded me more of the earthy flavorful Indonesian peanut sauce rather than the typical sweet peanut sauce served in Thai restaurants.  It gave a nice creamy mouthfeel.  The herbs used helped break the monotonous flavor while the veggies gave the bowl much needed texture.  It was a pleasant surprise and a welcomed one.  The noodles made this bowl immensely filling.    * Macaroni Salad with Spam (No idea how much):  Where did they find macaroni pasta so big?  This didn't quite taste like the Hawaiian mac salad I'm accustomed to and it certainly didn't have that overbearing mayonnaise that I'll guilty admit to liking, but it was a solid side dish.  I didn't really taste any salty Spam.  I wouldn't get this again.  * Basil & Mint Limeade ($4):  Strong and pungent, the basil and mint slaps you in the face!  It's refreshing and pairs nicely with the Thai Peanut Bowl.  * Iced Tropical Green Tea ($2.50): It's just iced tea and that's good enough for me.  Portions are smaller and prices are high but the quality is amazing.  I really want to stop in on a Saturday when they sell their $10 Bagel Sandwiches.  It's essentially lox and bagel but with fish this fresh, I'm pretty sure it'll be the best lox you can get!  I'll be counting fishies before I sleep tonight.  You won me over, Chula.  Please reciprocate my love via a pound or two of poke.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with the other fellow yelpers on this one.   Chula Seafood is the proof that even in Arizona you can still get the freshest of the fish. Most of the seafood comes from the Pacific with the exception of scallops (which I particularly love) coming from Massachusetts.  Prices are fair considering that we are in the desert where scarceness of quality dominates. They also have sandwiches and bowl if you want to sit there for a quick bite of the ocean. I'm very excited to go back!   Eat more fish! Eat Chula! ;)"}
{"text":"Literally the best poke bowl I've ever had. The fish and all the other ingredients were so fresh. I have had a few different places around the valley but this one is hands down the best. The service was super friendly and personable too! It was a bit pricey but for quality, I don't mind paying. Will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I go way too often. Freshest fish in Arizona. Do yourself the favor"}
{"text":"So fresh! So tender! So flavorful! I used to live in Solana beach and can't find anything that tastes this way here in AZ and am always disappointed when I try those new lil trendy joints. Now I have my seafood spot! Seriously don't bother going anywhere else! Can't wait to go back and try more! The service was great! You walk up and order and they bring it out quickly. Super awesome, big thumbs up for this place! Doin it right :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh seafood in the valley look no further than Chula Seafood. This place is fantastic! How do I know its \"fresh\"? I have seen them carving up whole tuna, swordfish and salmon to put in the case and for poke bowls. My chef friend turned me on to this place and I am so glad he did as this place is truly a winner.  Menu:  While Chula has a great everyday menu they also do some limited dishes towards the end of the week. Thursday - Pastrami smoked salmon sandwich (delicious!) Friday - Chef Juan's Friday Feature (incredible one-off dishes. Limited item, call ahead) Saturday - Salmon bagels!! (limited item, call ahead)  Chula also supports other great food purveyors in the valley such as Noble Bread, Super Chunk & Homeboys Hot Sauce to name a few.   If you love seafood give them a shot...you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I want to return to Tempe just so I can eat here again. Adorable place. The staff was totally welcoming. This is an obvious local favorite. Fun to see patrons come in and everyone knows everyones' name. You order the special.. whatever it is, because it's damn good. Chimicurri to dip my tuna melt?! Yes, please! Super clean, trendy, Bob Marley music playing. Just go!"}
{"text":"I come in about once every two weeks. I live down the street which is extremely dangerous. They are only open Wednesday- Saturday so when I am craving it on a day they are closed I count down the days until they are open again. The guys (owners) here are super friendly and nice. After a few trips they will remember your name and face- that's always a welcoming feeling. I'm from California so fresh fish has always been on the dinner plate for me and these guys truly provide that. I always come in and get the Hawaiian poke bowl and it never disappoints. Sadly it's Sunday today and they aren't open- even though I just came yesterday. You have to give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place for the best and freshest seafood in the Valley! Hands down, nothing compares. Living in the desert, it is difficult to find quality seafood. Top grocers don't even carry fresh restaurant grade tuna. I have been to Chula seafood twice now. The first was to purchase fresh tuna for a dish I was making. It was seriously some of the best yellow fun tuna I have ever had... even in a restaurant!! The second time I ordered the Hawaiian poke. Delicious and substantial! The fish and seafood is always fresh. The staff and service are always friendly and knowledgeable. I love this place and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me just start this review by saying WOWZA!!! The peeps here are only open from Wednesday to Saturday from 10am -7 pm only. They own a fishing boat in San Diego, so the seafood being served here are super fresh, and never frozen. I heard about this peeps through a friend, and immediately made the trip from Litchfield Park to their location in South Scottsdale to try out their food. Yup, that's about 50 minute drive to, and 1 hour and 20 minutes back in traffic. You know what? It's totally worth the drive.  Let's get down to the food. I had 3 poke bowls. The first one was the ahi tuna bowl. This one is a little bit on the spicy side. I loved it. Just be cautious if you have a little one because of the heat. The second poke bowl was the salmon poke bowl. Aaah, the flavors of the one did a tango in my mouth. It had jalapeños, smoked pineapple, carrot slices, sesame seeds, edamame, and whatever amazing sauce was added to the already delicious salmon cubes. The last poke bowl was a salmon belly tartar kinda bowl. I can't explain this one. It's just yummy. I ate 4 slices of their blue fin tuna, and man... my mouth went to heaven. Melt in your mouth yumlicious. It's really hard to explain the extent of how delicious the fresh fish tasted in my mouth. Simply put, the freshness in the seafood made the poke bowls  better. The peeps here were extremely friendly and helpful. They take the time to explain everything to me. The restaurant is nice and clean. I can't wait to come back here to try more items on their menu, which changes every week depending on the catch of the day. BOOM! Cool or what??"}
{"text":"Best seafood in town by far. The tuna sandwich has unseated Bianco for the best tuna sandwich in town. The smoked salmon bagel is one of the best sandwiches in the city as well. You can't go wrong at this place. Top to bottom pick anything on the menu and it's great. A must go restaurant if you appreciate food"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Don't miss the sashimi. Freshest fish I've tasted in PHX. I'll be coming back. Super friendly staff. I just wish they were open Monday's! It's pricey but you won't get better quality poke than this."}
{"text":"I would not expect sashimi to be this good anywhere else other than Japanese restaurants. Their seafood is so fresh that I cannot detect any fishy smell on any pieces I've tried. I usually am not a fan of scallops, but I can eat theirs all day everyday! It literally melts in your mouth. If you want to purchase seafood to go, I believe some of them needs to be pre-ordered (depending on what it is). I recommend you to call ahead of time before coming here.  I will most definitely come back here again to try something else."}
{"text":"In the most unassuming location sits this fabulous fish market that serves poke too.  Chula's food is simply Devine.  The fish is extremely fresh and this makes their poke the very best in Phoenix.    I have tried everything on their menu a couple times.  My favorite is the Sweet and Sour salmon over lettuce with the sauce on the side.  I love the smoked onions and pineapples coupled with the sweet and tangy sauce.  Pro Tip: you can add any additional fish to your bowl.  I've added a scallop, a Smoked scallop and a small piece of smoked salmon(not all to the same bowl)."}
