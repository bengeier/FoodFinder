{"text":"Marotta's is one of those undiscovered gems of the Heights area. I was friends with Alicia and her family growing up.. and let me tell you they are \"real Eyetalian\". When I'm in the area I always try to stop in.  They have everything from awesome takeaway pizza, to a regular sit-down dinner with candles & wine. Alicia, her husband, and the entire staff did a fantastic job getting it off the ground. And the food, service, decor, etc. is still great after all these years. I have always had a great dining experience there. And it's certainly not stuffy--but also a place you feel \"good\" in.  Highly highly recommended. No jackets, ties, etc. required. GREAT FOOD at a REASONABLE PRICE with GREAT SERVICE. If you're in the Heights you probably already know the place. If not, definitely give it a try.  And--her mum makes some of the desserts fresh daily--so make sure to try some if they haven't sold out yet. Her desserts are memorable. Again, they are the \"real deal\" Italians.. an absolute treasure in this city.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town by far!  NY style, huge, worth every penny.   We usually get take out from here; however, dining in is a great experience as well.  They have a good wine list and some great pasta entrees.  The only negative is that the entrees are pretty pricey.  Servers are knowledgeable and attentive.  If it's your first time here - get the pizza!"}
{"text":"Marotta's never fails to satisfy me. It's easily the best pizza in Cleveland, and arguably in the state. My family roots are back in New York, and from what I've experienced, the pizza at Marotta's is seriously comparable (maybe even better) than ANY of the Original Ray's shops scattered around NYC. Despite it's small size, Marotta's boasts an intimate dining area with a small, yet impressive menu filled with traditional Italian dishes and deserts. The service was on the slow side, but the food itself definitely made up for it. We ordered a few appetizers and salads (calamari and the arugula salad) but the highlight of our experience was the pizza, hands down. The crust was the best part- crunchy, but not burnt. All in all, this place gets 5 stars. I'm getting hungry just reminiscing!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for YEARS for New York-style pizza. Best in Cleveland by far. The entrees are fantastic as well. I wish parking was better, but welcome to Cleveland Heights! Don't let that stop you though. Some of the best Italian in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great pizza and EXCELLENT server. Seriously, I wish I could send the servers at most restaurants to this one to learn from her (Darla). She didn't rush us at all, made constructive suggestions, and was attentive but didn't make us paranoid.  Atmosphere was romantic and cozy, but a touch on the too dark side--then again, I like a little more light than most.  On a scale of one to I'd definitely get this food again I just placed an order for a large margherita pizza that I'm picking up in an hour. Think that speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that if I could give 4.5 stars (or 4.8 even!), I would. Marotta's was so close to perfect.  My wife and I were greeted by a young and very professional staff right off the bat. It was a chilly 17 degrees the night we went, and they had a very large curtain up to keep out the cold. They sat us right next to the front door, so I was worried about the draft, but the curtain did it's job. Little things like that make me appreciate a place.  We came for the pizza, but the entrees looked delicious, and the seared scallop and fettuccine special sounded so good that we couldn't pass it up. It came with spinach and a creamy sauce that I can't remember exactly what it was. But it had a sweet, almost citrusy taste to it that was very good. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Everything about the dish was done very well.  Now on to the pizza. I am particular about my pizza, and I like to consider myself a bit of a pizza connoisseur. I lived in New York for a while so I will admit that there is a tinge of \"pizza snobbery\" involved but I just like a particular type of pizza. Marotta's was so close to perfect. SO CLOSE! We got the traditional pizza (red sauce, cheese) with prosciutto. The pizza was thin, which is a great start for me. The cheese was perfect. Just the right amount, and just starting to brown up and bubble from the heat of the oven. The sauce was on point. Tomato with just a little bit of sweetness.  My only complaint, and it's such a minor thing, is that for my taste, the dough was just a little tough. I'm not saying it was burnt, or overdone, it's just that the dough seemed a little too dense. Now, I don't like a super airy dough like you'd get at a delivery place, but I just felt like I had to bite and rip off rather than just bite through. It was very, very good, and I will get the pizza again (every special pizza sounded amazing), and I will certainly be back for some of the entrees, but again, the dough on the pizza was just a little too \"stiff\" for me to call it perfect.  4.5 (4.8 even!) stars."}
{"text":"Best pizza around the area. Il Greco is delicious. Fresh ingredients. A bit more pricey but much better quality than the competitors."}
{"text":"As far as cleveland pizza goes, this is my favorite.  It's got a particularly good crust.  It's good for dining in or taking out."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite go to for pasta! The service was incredible. Waiter was very attentive and explained the menu beautifully. The food even better. I had the carbonara and leftovers are even better :) I can't wait to go back and try their pizza"}
{"text":"Some of the best (and largest) pizzas in Cleveland come out of the tiny Marottas kitchen.    The food is as good, if not better than some of the best spots in Little Italy.  Everything that I have had  drips of homemade Italian goodness from the in-house made pasta to the hand tossed pies (not to mention their awesome selection of toppings that you don't find at a lot of pizza spots.    They also have one of our favorite happy hours in the area.  It runs Monday-Thursday from 5-7 (anywhere in the restaurant).  They offer excellent deals on some apps, entrees, pizzas and drinks.  The pizzas, though definitely worth the somewhat steep regular menu prices, are ridiculously cheap for what you get on the happy hour menu.  Service is always excellent with smiling, attentive servers and hostesses.  Some nights they even have a live musician/singer which take this \"old-school Italian vibed\" place to the next level."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Very small so you might have to wait on the weekends, but worth it. Pasta portions are huge and pizzas are some of the best in the city. Nothing pretentious about this place, just great food."}
{"text":"We almost always eat in. We usually eat the pizza, which is excellent, but the mussels and other entrees we've ordered also are very good. The service is always stellar, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is so outstanding the only thing they could do to make it better is to broaden the menu to add items. Everything is spectacular but they could use a few more dishes. The mussels appetizer and beet salad are terrific as is the heirloom tomato salad. The marinara sauce is yummy, rich and sweet and the specials are always outstanding. The service is great as are the pomegranate martinis. Definitely a favorite. Pizza is super thin and crusty, very New York style."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to dining here after my friends enthusiastically talked about it.  Our waiter never mentioned the specials to us but the table next to us got the full run-down.  My husband's Crown & Coke tasted off.  At first glance, most pastas and entrees are $25 ish.  We started with salads.  I opted for the sun dried tomato vinaigrette with Gorgonzola.  I had to salt it because it was under seasoned.  And there was barely any Gorgonzola on it.  I went with the gnocchi.  Again, under salted.  The sauce was nice and creamy but it didn't have much flavor aside from the included sausage.  Now here is where it gets weird...the wine list.  How in the world can a restaurant with entrees in the $25 price range have a wine list that only lists varietals and no brands?  I asked the waiter about the brands and he was very sheepish about it.  Translation:  these are cheap wines, folks.  Yes, they are mostly Italian varietals but how can you pour a Super Tuscan for $8 a glass?  Hmm...  this place seems to be an old pizza place that one day decided to expand into a full size, albeit super small restaurant.  Given that Dante in Tremont, Nora in Little Italy, and Trentina in Cleveland Heights has similar price points in their menus, these places are all head and shoulders above Marotta's in terms of food quality, restaurant experience, and certainly wine list.  I don't get it, Marotta's, but we won't be back, and I am sad to say that.  I really wanted to love your restaurant.  Or maybe we completely missed the boat by not ordering pizza..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for really good Italian food in Cleveland Heights, you've found your spot. I haven't had pizza this authentic since I backpacked across Europe after I graduated with my Philosophy and Gender Roles in Postracial America degree from Case Western.   The service here is amazing. My waiter Bradley was so attentive to my every need. And don't get me started about the ambiance. It looks like a romantic cafe straight out of Venice in the middle of Cleveland Heights.   Now onto the food. In my world and national travels, I've had some good pizza. Personally, I think NY pizza, like everything else in New York City is overrated and not terribly unique. I've been to all of these places- Capri's needs to just turn into jeans. I've been to Santarpio's in Boston which was better than any NY pizza, aside from the fact that my car got stolen in that neighborhood.   Stop in an try their margherita pizza and enjoy a glass of Chardonnay on the lovely patio!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and I know my pizza. I've lived in Ohio for 7 years now and I have finally found pizza that I love! It's not as good as home, but it's damn close. I crave this pizza all the time now - so glad it's close to home! The staff is always very friendly and helpful too. Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Get a pizza or maybe the pasta. Can't pick which is better."}
{"text":"Only have had the pizza. As a native New Yorker suffering the life of Shaker Heights, this is as close  to a real pizza as i have found. The service is fast and the staff unusually attractive which is a plus. The word \"Delivery\" seems to have skipped northeast Ohio but that is what is required here and at all restaurants. In Manhattan I can have baked ziti delivered at 3 in the morning.  My native New Yorker kids beg for this pizza. Suggestion to all NE Ohio pizza places: In NYC and NJ we use SWEET not spicy sausage. Please fix."}
{"text":"As much as I love and have grown up with Geraci's, I have to finally admit to myself that Marotta's is the best pizza in Cleveland... it is incredible! The slices are huge. It folds perfectly but also has such a delicious crunchy crust. Every ingredient tastes so fresh and yummy. I love Marottas!  I moved to Cleveland Hts a year ago and tried so many places to find my \"pizza spot,\" including a lot of places in Little Italy. I have found a lot of cool restaurants since I moved here, but I am officially a Marottas customer for life."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing meal and it was during Happy Hour!! It's more than appetizers and drinks- full pastas and pizzas. I left out of there so full I had to walk it off- now that is one darn good happy hour. I'd also like to thank my server, Jeni. She was attentive, sweet, and made excellent recommendations! This is such a great little spot to have here in the Cedar Lee area. The intimate setting was perfect for a dinner for 1 or 4. I'll be back often... and with friends!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident one night and have been a regular since. One of the best pizzas between NYC and Chicago. Plus, their Italian table wines are a real bargain given the high quality."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian Restaurant, but not in Little Italy. No place I've found makes a better Bolognese sauce. It's not always on the menu, but it's worth calling ahead and going when they have it. Everything I've had here is excellent. The place is small and can get quite loud on a busy night, especially when groups show up."}
{"text":"What they did to that lobster meat should be considered a crime...   The waitress lured me into the linguini special with the mention of lobster claw and knuckle meat. When it arrived to the table I was thrilled to see numerous claw pieces and other assorted chunks of lobster- very generous. The shame came when I realized that all of that meat had virtually been wasted because A) it was the most over cooked lobster meat I have ever eaten and B) it tasted like a fish tank.   Mistake 1- Not looking at Yelp first to see that I should have ordered the pizza   Mistake 2- Ordering a lobster dish in Cleveland Heights, but to my defense it was the \"special\" for the night so one would think that it would have to be fresh and prepared well- especially if it's the feature right?   WRONG. I gave it one star because the pasta was cooked perfectly and my company for the evening was awesome. So I guess that Marotta's can't claim that one star all on their own. Moral of the story- don't offer a lobster linguini special if you don't know how to cook lobster or know that it should taste like lobster."}
{"text":"Lived in Cleveland for almost 2 years now and this place is hands down the best pizza in Cleveland...not even close. NY style cheese or NY style with kalamata olives--keep it simple and you will enjoy the amazing freshness and quality of ingredients. Top 5 pizza I've ever had anywhere. #1 in Cleveland for sure. I've ordered from here over 5 times and it's been excellent each time. Pro tip: place is small so carry out and call ahead early (they're popular and busy) as they sometimes need a 1-2 hr advance on pizza orders."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed ,we got the bass with the mussels meal and gnocchi and it was super fishy and tasted horrible. The calamari was great the salad was good, the wine was mediocre but the waiter didn't care that we didn't like the entrée. The waiter did offer us a free dessert but we declined. We have eaten there for years and was so disappointed in the meal, every meal we've had there has been amazing- just not tonight and the service was not so good."}
{"text":"Words do not adequately describe my passion for Marotta's pizza. I've been going there since the mid-2000s.  I am as intense a pizza connoisseur as I know, and this far and away tops my list in the Cleveland area.  I've spent 20 years scouring Cleveland for New York-style pizza, and I've found it nowhere else except for a place downtown (which is my second-favorite Cleveland pizza maker).  To be sure, Marotta's pizza is not a cheap, by-the-slice NY-style place.  It is high-end with the best ingredients.  A key bonus is that the owners and staff are not only courteous, but become friends to customers.  And the restaurant atmosphere is intimate (even for carryout, which occurs in a small bit atmospheric place).  It is not hyperbole to say that getting Marotta's is always a high point of my month.  I cannot overstate how much I adore this place and its pizza."}
{"text":"Small, narrow, NY style restaurant with open kitchen.  Very romantic spot for dinner. This is NOT Olive Garden. Chef/owner worked in New York and his goal has been to bring New York style upscale dining to Cleveland Hts.   The calamari app is very good, pasta's are big portions and usually very good... especially the home made Bolognese... but think about 'splitting' the entree portion for two.  The thin crust pizzas are excellent.  The wine list is ALL Italian, some good picks both in red and white. Salad specials are usually very good.  The only drawback can be the service on the weekend. Lots of well meaning college type waiters working the room, and on a busy night, the service can get slow..... during the week it is not a problem."}
{"text":"Saturday night around 8:30 we decided to check this place out. The weather was horrible and it was an impromptu decision. We had been here once before, but only for music, wine, and dessert - not an actual dinner. It was packed and hard to grab a seat last time, so we were slightly nervous that we wouldn't be eating for another hour.  Luckily, the wait was only about ten minutes tops. We were able to grab seats on the back patio which is enclosed - this was perfect since it was so rainy.  We ordered the heirloom salad, which was one of the specials for the evening. It's a caprese salad, essentially - and we were shocked that it was $14. (No price listed, and yes, our fault that we didn't ask.) However, the portion seemed worth no more than $9 at most, in my opinion.     The large 18 inch pizza is definitely worth every bit of $20 in terms of size and toppings. And I'd say to always get the large ... because... leftovers, mkay?  We got the Melanzane which has eggplants, sundried tomatoes, feta cheese, garlic cloves, basil, and mushrooms.   In terms of PIZZA... there are a lot of great pizzas in the Cleveland area - I'm hard pressed to find a pizza I like better than Vero, and I felt the same way here. I love thin crust, and this had it - but it had no flavor and it took maximum effort to tear, chew, and cut. There wasn't a defined sauce - the flavors were perceived solely through the toppings, and to me, that was disappointing. Great pizza sauces are worth savoring and if this was one of them, it certainly didn't stick out to me.   I think that's that. I'd give it a 3 1/2, because I'd totally come back for the atmosphere and the close proximity. I just know for me, there's better pizza out there."}
{"text":"Marottas is one of the best Italian restaurants in Cleveland; those who know it love it, for those who have not been there it is a hidden gem.  Located in the Cedar Lee neighborhood in a single storefront you will find a narrow room with a tiny bar and the kitchen on one side and a single row of tables on the other side.  The atmosphere is intimate with dim lighting and classic Italian decor, this is a great place for a romantic dinner.    My friend and I came in on a cold Thursday night and split a Caesar salad and a large pizza, along with a nice bottle of wine which are half price on Thursdays.  The salad was a large portion with a tangy dressing an crispy croutons.  Sided with warm crispy Italian bread and quality olive oil for dipping a great start to the meal.  Pizza is New York style; a large pie with very thin crust.  For me this is near perfect pizza, the crust is crisp on the outside and a bit softer towards the middle, with a mild yeasty flavor.  The sauce is flavorful, without being spicy and the cheese is perfectly melted.  The ratio of sauce, cheese and crust works together perfectly, melding together so that each bite is more than then the individual ingredients.  None of the ingredients overpowers any of the other ingredients resulting in a perfect harmony.  The pie is expensive, but the portion is large.  The rest of the menu offers great pastas and entrees.   Portions are large with great flavors.    Marottas is not inexpensive, but the portions are large, flavors are excellent and the atmosphere is romantic.  Service is attentive and relaxed.  Portions are big enough to share and it is quite a popular place for takeout pizza.   If you are looking for an upscale dinner give them a try."}
{"text":"It's the good stuff!   Closest to NY style I've ever found in Cleveland (especially the traditional pie). I wish the offered it by the slice! Prices are on the higher side for pizza, but it's worth the splurge. Nice ambiance if you're dining in. Especially on Friday nights when there is live music."}
{"text":"Horrible was sat in back barely greeted. Took 10 minutes to get water and waitress didn't say a word. Got up and left not sure how long would have taking to actually be acknowledged to place order."}
{"text":"Marotta's is in a great location and the food is very good. 6 of us walked in on Saturday at 6:30 and asked for a table.   The person who greeted us checked around the restaurant, came back and said there would be a 45 min wait for a table.  There was an empty table for 6 at the front of the restaurant beautifully set. I asked if we could have the table inside and her reply was, \"it's taken\".  I asked if they now take reservations and she replied \"no\".  I felt very unwelcome and probably will not return."}
{"text":"Although I'm new to the Cleveland food scene, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this is some of the best pizza in Cleveland. While maybe it's not New Haven or Brooklyn good...it's not far off either. The specialty pizza's can get a bit pricey, while a large cheese will run you around $15. The pie's are thin and crispy and made with high quality ingredients. Definitely my go-to in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"Well it was touted as the best pizza. Not as take out that's for sure. Good but problems. All ingredients fresh. Dough is flavorless. While I'm sure take out makes tons of money the pizza is not the type that does well by the time it gets home. Sorry and I really wanted to love it. Vero hands down better and that's probably why they refuse to do take out. I will try it again in house."}
{"text":"Carryout. 18 inch thin crust cheese pizza. $14 super crisp."}
{"text":"Too bad the service here was total crap.  Seriously, bad service is the pits and too bad for this place that one waitress ruined the experience and possible further patronage for 3 separate couples.   Okay so we get here and there is a wait. No problem. We get seated on the back patio (outdoors), spectacular. We get water from the bus boy. Grand.  Then it all goes downhill. The waitress forgot alcoholic drink orders ((hello!)) she brought the main dish for one of us while the rest of us were still nibbling on our salads. Then when the main meal came for the rest of us the appetizers followed. No refills, not a word about how our food was. It was an utter disaster.  We ended up asking the bus boy for refills, bread, the status of our food. It was foolish. I mean had I not been with a couple that really felt bad for suggesting the place I may have had a little meeting with someone in management. Really it was that bad. The shocking thing was, there was no management around that I could see anyway.  Someone to make sure the clientele was pleased. I would think someone could be checking to make sure food was coming out on time or in an order that made some sense. WHAT A MESS!  So all that crapiness aside the food was alright. I liked the creativity of the dishes. Food was fine. We all liked what we had although none of us really enjoyed anything enough to erase the bad service.  The drinks we decent, the location is great. The patio is comfortable. The bread is good and the dishes are good portion. The prices are a little steep for my taste and considering the lack of attention it's COMPLETE BULL! But whatever.  I'm sorry that this girl ruined so many people's night and their opinions of the joint (mind you we talked about this with another friend whom said he got crappy service there too) but if the management was more present maybe this kind of thing would not happen. Actually I know it, so shame on them too."}
{"text":"Excellent place! The pizza is a thinner crust, light, and flavorful. The alads as really creative and come with amazing fresh dressings, the sun-dried tomato, mmm!! Save room for the tiramasu which is one of a kind! Great dining experience, and can't wait to try more options!"}
{"text":"My wife and I don't go out to dinner much but we thought we would try Marotta's. It was a little later in the evening and we asked if they were still serving and they said yes. All I have to say the pizza they brought out was burnt. We tried to eat some of it but it was uneatable. They made another one but it was not much better. What a waste of money. Maybe the cook was mad he had to make a pizza, but they told us to sit down. The waiter should have kicked ass but there was little concern. We stepped outside to wait for the new pizza and it was on the table already. We took it home in a box! Didn't make for an enjoyable experience. We even left a tip, I have second thoughts about that. I still can't get over how bad it was and they served it to us. 52 dollars later I feel stupid we didn't walk out."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland.  Great ambience - we just love it.  This is the perfect small place for a romantic date or the best place in town to carry out a New York style thin crust Pizza.  Their pastas and salads are wonderful, and their service is top notch.  We frequent Marottas - pizza 2-3 times a month and eat there at least once a month and really have never had a bad experience in many many years.  We will keep going back unless the screw something up :)"}
{"text":"I'm really torn between three stars and four. I'm notoriously cheap so it's hard for me give a really great review of a place where the dinner plates are $18-30 per person. I think at that price range I should be more than satisfied, I should be impressed. On the other hand, the food here is pretty good and I understand why other reviewers would call this a good date spot. I guess I will just say that they don't score really high on my 'value' rating. Now, we can get on with the review...  We went with my girl's family. The whole experience was pretty satisfying. Reading the other reviews I now wish I had ordered the pizza. My girlfriend and I both ordered pasta dishes and both of them were quite good, but also quite salty. I think everyone else liked their food as well. Strangely, what I liked the most out of the entire experience was the bread, which was crusty and chewy and just about perfect sourdough. It was an effort not to stuff myself with bread while waiting for my meal to come out. It was especially delicious when dipped in the sun-dried tomato Gorgonzola salad dressing.   The indoor atmosphere is quite nice. We did not sit outside because her family are \"indoor people\". We did not experience any service problems like some of the earlier reviewers. Our waiter was quite competent, although the bus-girl seemed like maybe she had never worked in a restaurant (or dealt with customers) before. No real complaints though."}
{"text":"Never dined in, but for great NY style pizza, this is the best I've found in Ohio. It's a bit expensive, but always my top pick on pizza night."}
{"text":"I have walked past this subtle shop 100s of times, never realizing this was a restaurant.  The store front i think is quite subtle, when in my quest for a new and \"I need something more in my pizza,\" they popped up.  My wife ordered, i picked up and found the place to be very appealing. I have not checked out the menu extensively, but i could not have been happier about the people working their, the atmosphere of the place (think fine dining meets pizza place) and the pizza was delicious.  It was the crust i was searching for!  As i was talking to the chef, i also found out that they have been around for quite some time, and are one of the most established local joints on lee road. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, bad pizza. Ordered Margherita pizza, after reading reviews about crust, imagine pizza baked on a Ritz cracker. Cuisine conceived by a triathlete. My three year old who loves to scavenge pizza crust gave it the blech face. Slow service made it even less delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night pizza and wow were we impressed. They had a spot on the patio which had a great view of the parking lot, but as far as patios go this one was pretty nice. The server disappeared a lot but i always had water in my glass and had he been more visible may have had 2 glasses of wine instead of one... Ordered a Margarita pizza and it was delicious... Tomatoes and arugula were very fresh. Sauce was tasty as well. Wish we had went with the small instead of the large but had leftovers for days so thats not always a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Very good.  True New York style.  Excellent ingredients.  I highly recommend Marottas.  Be prepared to pay, though: 3 item pizza, salad and 2 soft drinks, $44.00"}
{"text":"I've had pizza from here a few more times since my initial post and wanted to bump the score up to a solid 5 stars as they've been consistent and the quality of the food is always on point. Hands down the best pizza I've found on the east side of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great Italian, best dinner salad (which comes with your dinner), a chef who cares about the ingredients, check it out"}
{"text":"I went Marottas last night with 4 others. I like the cozy atmosphere, which make me feel like Europe. We were quickly sited by the back door. It was Monday, so door was closed. Not really happy about right out side the bathroom.  Recommend: their calamari is lightly breaded stir with tomato, garlic and spinach, tomato dipping source is delicious as well. Grilled artichoke is very delicious with the special dark source topping. If you like mac-cheese, try the creamy Gnocchi paste in happy hour list. Yes, they started have the happy hour, love the delicous basile lemonade, small amount of food with great price. Last but not the least, we ordered the Melanzane pizze. the rosted garlic and eggplant are my favorate companation.   Our server are very professional and good seller. servous was a little bit slow.  Will definiately come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland Heights for 15 years and hadn't visited this place until last night.  What a mistake!  Walked in around 7pm on a Friday and this place was hopping.  Stood in line to talk to the hostess and she was happy to let my husband and I have a seat at the tiny bar to have some wine even though we were just going to order pizzas to go.  (Most places won't let you do that on a busy night.). Ordered a bottle of wine that was recommended after told me they didn't carry a Malbec or Merlot.  The wine was a very nice Italian red and exactly as described.  Ordered 2 large pizzas to go and enjoyed some chit chat with the executive chef/owner, Brian.  He talked about the business, the vision, and the outdoor patio (which I'm hoping to enjoy this summer!)  He definitely knows the who's who of the Cleveland culinary scene and we had a great time talking to him while he tossed some pizzas around.  Can't wait to come back to the dine-in side to get another sense of the restaurant.  Had to wait until today to write to review as the pizza was to go.  My teenage son says it's the best pizza he's ever eaten.  I couldn't agree more!  We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Never mind the crushed pepper. You want crushed garlic for you oil n bread.Best Pizza in town - well the plain cheese pizza is - its the one I always get. The rest of the menu while I have tried some of it - is good even very good but man is it a bit high in the pricing.....it if wasnt for that this would be a 5 star Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a cute little gem on Lee Road I'm surprised I haven't been to before.  Restaurant is an intimate and cozy ambiance. Went for their happy hour (4-7 during the week). Tried the pizza which was good as well as the artichoke skewers which were surprisingly delicious.  The staff was super helpful in choosing both wines and food. I'd definitely recommend both the happy hour and regular menu. Great place for a date night!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since it opened. I'll occasionally dine in but as a lover of NYC style pizza and living about a mile away I often carry out. Over the past 9 months the quality of their pizzas has deteriorated, uneven cooking, saggy crust, burnt. Last night may have been the final straw. I went in to pick up my pie and was the only one at the counter so I started to say \"pickup for...\" No eye contact from the woman behind the counter who was doing something else, maybe a check. I'm waiting while a couple other workers are standing around. Finally she hands me someone else's credit card to which I replied \" that's not my card, I haven't even paid for my pizza yet. I've been worried. \"The woman then says \"wait a bit it\" and then goes off with a bill and apparently the credit card.  I was still the other person at the counter and editing. Meanwhile another worker hands me a bag and says \"here's your Caesar Salad.\" I told him no that's not playing I'm here to pick up my pizza. Do they give me my pizza? No, I'm still waiting as the only person at the counter. Finally after waiting for a while the woman comes back, gets my pizza, prepared and runs the bill.  Almost 10 minutes and I was the only one at the counter. I get home, open the box to find a burnt crust, hard and crunchy. Lousy, apathetic service and unorganized. Never used to be like this. Has there been a change in ownership? Change in management? Anyway time to look for another carry out pizza place in the Heights."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good wine options.  I love to dine al fresco and I wish the patio didn't overlook the parking lot and yes the service can be spotty.  I've also had good service, seems to be significant turnover.  Wish they were open later into the evening but that's a major complaint in Cleveland in general."}
{"text":"Really good crunchy pizza. I like that this place is not stingy with the toppings. The waiter was a gem who was kind and made me feel comfortable. I would definitely attend this place again."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food - the pizza is amazing, pastas excellent - and the service is always attentive without being overbearing or annoying.  Servers are very knowledgable about the dishes and wines. A pleasure!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had (in Cleveland, anyway). The crust is the reason! Really, really good. The tira misu is also amazing, and I often don't even like tira misu.  They're small--especially winter when the boxed-in back patio is closed--but still nice inside. Very quiet and dark, with a curtain separating the diners from the take-out counter."}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant, around 8 tables and though we came after 9 on a Friday night, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table (they don't take reservations). The calamari appetizer was delicious and Caesar salad was also very good and we both loved the vegetarian pizza, but thought the pepperoni pizza was very salty. Service was excellent.  You can tell that they use very fresh high quality ingredients.  Most entrees were $20-30...beer and wine were also expensive."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza! I have never dined in which I will soon, but I always get their pizza to go! I get their Molto Marottas with pepporoni, sausage, green peppers, and red onions and it is DELICIOUS!!! Its not greasy, its flavorful and so tasty! This is one of my go to pizza to go! Its just so good!"}
{"text":"Had the Traditional Pizza with pepperoni and onion.  It was pretty good.   The dinning area is very skinny with only about 8 tables in a row. Dark, semi romantic atmosphere. You get bread with oil to start off your meal, like a lot of Italian restaurants. The service was friendly and consistent."}
{"text":"My NYC pedigree has turned me into an over critical pizza snob who will usually only indulge when visiting family. Cleveland pizza is a weird variation and I don't enjoy many places even though I have become accepting of the Appalachian Hillbilly style. Crostata's is good although it is more of an authentic Neapolitan pizza. I prefer the NY style above all. Marotta's has flown under the radar for quite a while and when I heard that it is NY style I knew that I had to try. The only other NY pizzas I can think of are Vincenza's, Capri, Sweet Basil and Bucci Brick Oven and am not too fond of them. Vincenza's has awkward business hours, Capri is glorified mall pizza with a weird overuse of garlic, Sweet Basil and Bucci's both miss the mark somehow. Marotta's seems to be truest to the style and taste. If this were in NYC I wouldn't eat there. We are 500 miles away so it gets the pass. It reminds me of an NY pizza one may find in Florida. The taste is not exact. The sauce is decent and the cheese is good enough. My main gripe is with the crust. I am starting to think the whole idea of the chemical composition of NYC public water may play a huge role in the dough for pizza. The crust is a little too chewy and does not break easily when bitten. I also prefer the crust to have char without being burnt. It is a fine line to walk. Maybe it is the oven temperature. I will request well done next time and try my luck. Overall, this is a good substitute for the real. I encourage anybody who loves NY pizza to give Marotta's a try. People always gripe about the hours of Vincenza's and this solves that issue. $10 for a regular cheese pizza is the nice price."}
{"text":"Exceptional pasta. Great mussels. Good salads. Nice wine list. Somewhat romantic - not bad. Really great pizza, tho it's a little bit expensive as take-out given other good and affordable choices in the Heights. So-so service most times (have been at least 15 times over past 5 years). Nice atmosphere. Affordable. One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"I grew up in New Jersey, and the plain pizza at Marotta's rivals my favorite \"tomato pie\" from the Garden State (De Lorenzo's in Trenton). Marotta's other pizzas are also excellent -- among the best I've had in Northeast Ohio. Their pasta, chicken and seafood dishes are also well-prepared, and service is superb. The inside tables are packed a bit too closely together, but overall, Marotta's is first-rate."}
{"text":"Marottas is a Cleveland Heights staple. Of course the pizza is amazing as we all know in this area. You won't be disappointed with any pasta dish as well! And to top it off the service is always superb!! If you are new to the area this is a must try. And if live in CH and haven't gonna you need to go!"}
{"text":"Nice patio but small. They need to do something about the parking lot headlights blasting into the patio.  I had the penne and it was a huge portion... But only so-so on taste. Tasted like pasta from a box.   Good wine list and appetizers."}
{"text":"I love thin crust pizza- NY style pizza- and honestly the closest I've seen here is probably Vincenzas. PW suggested if I truly loved NY style to give Marotta's a shot. sooooo about a year later, i finally did!! I ordered carryout so I can't comment on the service, but as far as the pizza goes, it was damn good pizza.  Was it thin enough for me to be satisfied that it was that \"crispy, crunches when you take a bite out of it\" crust? No, absolutely not. Pretty chewy and thicker than I would like. But, was the sauce delicious and did the pizza overall do it for me? Yes and Yes.   I agree with PW in that I will likely ask for it well done the next time I go to see if it helps make it a bit crispier, but more than being a NY style pizza fan, I am a PIZZA fan and this was good pizza. And for $10 for a \"small\" pie of 6 generous slices of cheese pizza, I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza. My husband is from NYC he says it's definitely a New York style...he feels like home."}
