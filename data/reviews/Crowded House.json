{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a reservation so seated right away. Service was quick and friendly. The hummus was SO GOOD and they gave me extra laffa bread at no charge! The portions were also pretty big, so I had leftovers to take home. There were quite a few people getting take out while I was there too, so adding it to my take out list."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst mediterranean joints in Toronto. Its actually an insult to mediterranean food. The bread is tasteless and dry. The meat had no flavour and my kid's fake cheese pizza had canned tomato paste as a base. Lets see how long this place lasts."}
{"text":"I'm kinda disappointed. We came three times. All three were terrible.   Place is lovely. Tables could been better placed. Good decoration. Too much money spent to have skids of water and pop in the corner.   Staff is amazing. Helpful. Kind. Engaging.   Food?? Not sure how to explain. Falafel were like rocks. The laffa (bread) is not great. Tabouleh? That's an insult. Call it burgul salad. Call it parsley...but tabouleh? It has no sauce. It is dry.   We were very exited to have a place as such opening but unfortunately it is not great. Unless this is what Israeli cuisines is supposed to taste."}
{"text":"It's a nicely decorated place, the host taking our order was more fit to a fish market than a restaurant. Two tables that came after us waited and waited then decided to just leave, we waited an hour before one of us got the order, mine came in installments accompanied with a half burned loaf of bread. I had the falafel dish that came with seriously bitter tahini sauce and over oiled sweet potatoes, my friends had a poutine shawarma that he was pleasantly surprised with. We were billed for an order we did not get and when complained about the host nicely offered a 5$ coupon as a cash buyer declined. I don't think I'm coming back there although i can see this place could have been a great onr"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here today with a friend.  We both had the vegan burger in their house made laffa bread.  The enormous variety of fresh toppings made on site in the morning was amazing, from hummus to an amazing taboule and unique cabbage salad.  Even the hot sauce was house made and not from a bottle.  The mix of fresh flavours was just wonderful!  The owner and chef were so friendly and kind.  I wanted to drink coffee all afternoon and then continue with dinner.  Will definitely be back.  Fresh, delicious and affordable food!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  As a chef, I am hard to please, but they knocked it out of the park! Falafel is the best I've ever had!  Baba Ghanoush delicious!  Service could have been a bit quicker, and our server  had on way too much perfume, but otherwise it was one of the best food experiences I've had in Toronto.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant is excellent  The food is delicious  The prices very good reasonable  The device excellent  It's location is stellar  I loved it 3x now in a week"}
{"text":"The other reviews made this place seem very promising and the menu looked pretty good on paper, so we decided to give it a try as Mediterranean food is one of my faves. We started off with some dips and the laffa bread. So far so good. The flavours and textures were there and the laffa came nice and hot out of the oven.   For mains we had the schnitzel with garlic potatoes and the shawarma with sweet potato fries. The schnitzel had a light crispy batter but the shawarma (a mix of lamb and turkey) was very greasy and flavourless. The sweet potatoes were oily and limp, while the garlic potatoes were also fried in oil but soft, under seasoned and not very garlicky at all.   Overall a little underwhelming considering I've had better meals at some shawarma counters. Despite our experience, I do have to commend our server (the owner) for the pride he has in his food as he explained the care that goes into each dish in great detail. Unfortunately we were not as impressed."}
{"text":"Short and simple review: a newly opened Mediterranean restaurant with ample seating, open kitchen concept and a very friendly owner.   The food was great - especially the shawarma poutine combo! Also, Hummus w/Shakshuka has very authentic flavors.  Overall, a good place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at Crowded House.  I was treated like a member of the family.  The owner was amazing and very proud of the fact that everything is made from scratch everyday. At the end of the day they give anything left over to the homeless and start fresh again the next day. The food was absolutely mouth watering.  We tried a lot of different dishes and i fell in love with the food.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's like the mi va me of the east side. Awesome laffa wraps and everything is made from scratch. Looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant you really feel like you are home, the owners Iris and Mike really take care of you, food is outstanding with a funky feel."}
{"text":"AMAZING restaurant!!! Probably the best Mediterranean food I've ever tasted   Everything tastes so fresh and delicious, I'm definitely going to come here again and so should you!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner when they first opened, and there were definitely kinks. After a month, we came for brunch on a Saturday and the service was fast and friendly. The food came quickly and it was delicious.   The brunch menu is very reasonable for the portion you get. My husband got their house waffles ($8) with additional chocolate chips ($1), and you get 2 huge waffles. It was a nice and light batter and not too dense. I had their 2 eggs any style ($7), and it came with chopped salad, 2 pieces of latkes and a choice of laffa bread or baguette. I opted for their house made laffa bread. The latkes was very crispy and delicious with a hit of onion and spices. The chopped salad consists of diced tomatoes, and cucumbers tossed in olive oil and spices. The salad was very fresh and delicious.   Overall, it was a very enjoyable meal and the service was fast. We'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great space! As soon as you step in the door you are greeted by an inviting delicious exotic aroma. Very friendly staff,    And the food is amazing, great tabouli salad and a must try is the humus, it's like whipped cream! Highly recommended."}
