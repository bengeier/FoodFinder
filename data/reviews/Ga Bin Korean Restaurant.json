{"text":"Growing up near Yonge and Finch, I'm used to eating really good Korean food. Didn't think GaBin was going to be anything near what I'm used to but so glad to say I'm wrong.  The service is very friendly and attentive, and the food came out really quick. The banchan was fresh and plentiful. We ordered pork bone soup and rice cakes. The pbs had a very tasty broth and 4 pieces of meat. The rice cakes (which can be bland in some places) was also full of flavor and just plain delicious.  You'd think being in Scarborough, you'd be hard pressed to find really good Korean... Glad that's not the case. Can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Combination of price, food and service = definitely one of my frequent spots.  No other korean place I go to give so many side dishes and they give a generous amount too. If you don't feel bad, they won't stop you from ordering seconds.   Good food. Good price. Acceptable service.    I understand other people's frustration when they are busy, not enough waitress, everything takes forever. Heck, I feel the same. However, I didn't walk in a fancy restaurant expecting great service (expecting to pay $20/ dish + 20% tips). I'm there for good food to fill my stomach. This place hits the spot.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Ga Bin since it opened way back when. I've tried a variety of dishes from here, but my usual go-to dishes are the bulgogi-style soup or the mild rice cakes with beef. Quality of food is still just as good now as it was when it first started up. Definite thumbs up for the authentic Korean flavours they provide.  In terms of service, I feel that they are lacking compared to the good service they once had. Don't get me wrong; service is great when it's empty, like maybe on a weekday, but when it gets super busy, it's a different story.  For example, I went with two of my friends on a Saturday night around 7ish. It was pretty much a full house with only two servers. We were seated and given tea. We decided on dishes pretty quickly but had to wait quite a while before our orders were taken. After multiple failed attempts of waving one of the servers down, one finally came to us and took our orders. The time for the main dishes to arrive was quite long but understandable, as it was really busy. However, what was not understandable was when our main dishes finally arrived, we had not even been given our utensils nor the side dishes yet. I felt like our table especially was a neglected because we were the farthest table from the kitchen and main counter. The food was delicious though (because I was super hungry), but I was a little disappointed that my dish was warm and not freshly hot, as if it had been sitting there for a while before it was brought to me.  The main thing is that they need more than two servers when it's a full house with additional people waiting to be seated. Nothing hurts a delicious eating experience more than disappointing service! Here's to hoping that Ga Bin will hire more staff soon."}
{"text":"This is probably my recommended Korean restaurant within Scarborough. I personally live in Markham but this is the place to go!   Their food is great and flavourful. Their service is quick and very friendly. They don't have many employees so you have to bare with them trying to manage the whole restaurant.  I haven't tried their KBBQ yet but each time I do order their Kimchi Stew, Pork Bone Soup or their Grilled Mackerel. They have not disappointed me one bit.  Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"There portion sizes were generous and the appetizers had large servings. The service was fast, though there was only 1 sever, so as more people showed up, the device got slower. The time for the food and appetizers to come was about average."}
{"text":"LAST PARAGRAPH IS THE WORST.   I came here twice and I ordered the same thing. I ordered the hot pot for two ~$24.99. Both times I ordered the same hot pot (there's a selection of 4 different hot pots with different soup bases and toppings). The first time we ordered it, it came with enoki mushrooms. The second time we ordered it, the enoki mushrooms were missing. It's inconsistent, but we didn't press on it because it wasn't a big deal.   Originally, my friend and I wanted to order the bbq meat. It was extremely expensive ~$35-60 for one meat serving and you had to choose two meat servings! I went with one friend, so if we ordered it the bill would have probably came up to $90 for two people! I really don't like their \"you have to choose two meats\" policy and I'm assuming their meat is expensive because they've advertised it as aged meat. I'm not sure how much different that would taste, but i've always had kbbq at yonge and finch (korea town) and it was around $35 and enough to fill two people with empty stomachs! The \"must order two meats\" doesn't make sense to me, because ordering a kbbq should get a lot of meat as it is.  The worst part about this experience, or my second experience, was the customer service. The bill came and I was paying the bill in cash. My friend leaves because she's covered most of the bill (she payed the bills) and i'm handling the change. As soon as she leaves a staff (ahjumma) rushes in, corners me so I can't exit, takes the bills and says, \"YOU NEED TO TIP 10%. 10% TIP IS THE MINIMUM\". I was so confused because she was speaking so fast and she just came out of no where. She's also standing extremely close to me and it was just a weird and uncomfortable experience. Until I could underdtand what she was saying I kind of just froze there. I'm quite shy in person and i'm not that assertive... People were staring at me because she was being so loud about it, yelling at me and giving me a dirty look. Lol, when I realized what she said I couldn't even explain myself. I was looking for change so I wasn't done paying the bill... I was going to tip 10%... I was scared and nervous so I found the largest change in my wallet and just gave it to her.. she gave me a dirty look when I left, or basically the entire time. I will NEVER be going back there again. Also, what happens if someone wanted to tip less than 10% because service was that bad? I had no intentions of not tipping, but if others wanted to tip less as a reflection of their service, will you stop them then? This doesn't make sense. If you had asked nicely, I wouldn't have given a one star review, but I felt extremely upset because I was accused. Why did I have to get a dirty look from you and who are you for coming so close to me that you block my exit, tell me I can't leave, and just yell at me."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on May 9 2013. I arrived at 6:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. About a handle full of tables occupied at this time. I picked my own table and sat myself down at a booth (had individual cushions) . Since the waitress was busy taking orders with another table.   This place has table top electric grilling. The menu had lots to choose from and has the typical Korean dishes. Prices are reasonable and comparable to other Korean restaurants.  We were given 6 side dishes: bean sprouts, Sweet potatoes, seaweed/kelp, chapjae, fish cakes, and kimchi.  I order a bowl of spicy seafood noodle (no clue the name of this in Korean.) and my friend had kalbi with rice. My noodle was average didn't have enough of a seafood mixture mainly found muscles (which I am not too fond of the frozen muscle taste) I couldn't even find one shrimp which is the norm in this noodle.   The kalbi was good. The presentation was different then the usual. The beef was cut up in to piece and two pieces of meatless rib bones were left on the plate as EVIDENCE that the meat was from ribs lol. It was great the kalbi was cut up for easy eating. Kalbi was nice and tender and sweet.  The waitress was probably busy with the kitchen because I hardly see her wait the tables till food came out. Not once she came to refill our tea. she came with two cups of tea at the start and I asked for additional cold water due to the hot day. So since the lady didn't come to refill our tea or water I gave my untouched tea to my friend.   The restaurant was bright. Clean. The washrooms were clean as well. Menu had many to choose from. Tables made of wood. But had an awkward height. My knees kept banging to the table. I guess it's low for table top grilling. The table had no buzzer for service. And the restaurant had one tv but it was paused at the time I was there. Casual setting. Tables are space out pretty well.  I would come here again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Gabin for a while now. The service is always friendly, even when the restaurant is busy. The place is very clean and the prices are very fair.  The quality of food is quite good. Not the best Korean food I've had, but definitely not the worst."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service 0. Food bland ( ordered the bibimbap in a stone pot). Would not go back"}
{"text":"It's a bit of far of serving table and chair, especially if you sit on couch side (not in the middle of the restaurant).  2 things caused us won't go back there anymore : - Pork bones is served cold, even the soup base is hot.  There's only 3 small complimentary appetizers dishes, compare than other ones which serve almost 10 small dishes.  Don't see any special.   Service is not bad.  Nice and clean washroom."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Korean resto in Markham/Scarborough for almost a decade now. Very good food and excellent service. Their banchan (side dishes) are really good, and their potatoes are sweet and crispy - my fav of any Korean restaurant. Sweet family owned resto!"}
{"text":"Friendly enough service (especially since they're busy most of the times we go), fair waiting times for food, prices a bit high, but consistently yummy food.  I find their portions of bimbimbap a tad small compared to most other places though.  I recommend the Seafood Hotpot and the LA Galbi. (:  Good selection of fresh side dishes (caramellized potato, japchae, kimchi and radishes, fishcake, beansprouts, etc.) that are refillable upon request.  Their KBBQ is ~okay - better than Chako's for sure, but marinade-less so not as good as Seoul Garden's (at Market Village).  Booth seating is slightly uncomfortable despite the cushions they place on the benches.  Clean and not crowded environment."}
{"text":"Went there with my friend. The food was okay. Obviously Korean food and price at Yonge and finch are better. The staff were pretty rude. They kept ignoring me and my friend and while my friend was paying, the old staff lady stood infront of our table, glared at my friend and yelled at her to pay 10% tips. To be fair, tipping is fine but their service was horrible. Not gonna go there again!"}
{"text":"As one of the many Korean Restaurants in Toronto, it's the top in terms of quality, pricing and service. Their food is authentic and customizable to your preferences and their Ban Chan or side dishes surpasses many of it's competitors. Their pricing is pretty good for the amount of food you get as well (beer is cheap too). Service depends on how busy the place is, but generally they're quick to react. They do take-out but sitting down is more worth it. Overall I rank them at 4 out of 5 stars because while they are great, they are still lacking in some areas that make them the best."}
{"text":"I've always come here with my family to have dinner. This is one of my favourite mom and pop Korean restaurants. It's usually always busy, but only 2-3 people working. They're actually very quick too. My favourite dish here is the basic gamjatang! It's super tasty here and cheap in price. They also have the best Korean side dishes here! My favourite is the pickled veggies (not the kimchi) and the sweet glazed potatoes. I've never found these side dishes anywhere else except for here!  I would recommend coming here during lunch time. They have lunch specials that are quite cheap in price too. I love their chicken katsu."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner two times and had lovely experiences both meals. The workers are really nice and the restaurant has a comfy feel to it. It's a small space though so beware if you have large parties, there may be difficulty with seating. That being said, we were a party of eight and that worked out fine.   Pork bone soup: We got two orders today and they were different in colour as well as level of spiciness, so there's definitely a little problem with consistency. The soup was too salty in my opinion but others seemed to enjoy it.   Bibimbap: We got the beef bibimbap in a stone pot (always choose stone pot if available!! The crispy layer of rice at the bottom is 90% of why I eat bibimbap). It was okay, I found that my order got less meat than there usually is and it wasn't anything extraordinary (not that many toppings compared to what I've eaten before) but it still tasted alright.   Fried banana: It tastes exactly like it sounds. I absolutely love fried bananas so this tasted like heaven in my mouth. I usually order this at AYCE sushi places and it tastes exactly like that.   I didn't get to try the beef broth with glass noodles but according to the person who ordered it, it's basically a few slices of beef, noodles, and water. If you're expecting a heavy and flavourful broth, this is not the right dish for you. At most Korean places I've been to, the broths are usually incredibly light and Ga Bin was no exception. If you enjoy clear, lightly flavoured soups them definitely try this.   I've also tried the seafood pancake before, it was yummy but I've always felt like the price of it isn't worth it for a single pancake. This is just me being cheap though, if I didn't look at the price I would order this every time for sure!  The side dishes are the bomb. They have fried honey potatoes, not the saucy ones that Nak Won has but still very tasty! They have the cold glass noodles here too, which is one of my favourites. They had this interesting green pancake thing as well. It was doughy in a pleasant way and I liked it quite a lot. Everything else was the typical side dishes you'd expect (Kim chi, seaweed, spicy fish cake, bean sprouts, etc).  Overall, it isn't anything special, it's like your standard Korean restaurant. However, their friendly staff definitely makes the experience all the more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Honestly, my boyfriend and I are here like every other week. (was just here last night)  We can't get enough of this place! This is legit, our favourite Korean place. Not only are they consistent with great flavour, they're also really close to us! Which is a plus all around!  We've kinda gone on this mission to try every single thing on the menu. And I will probably keep adding new pictures of every dish I try.   We generally get the same little combo as it comes with THEE most delicious soup ever. It's a choice of either bulgogi (pork, beef, chicken), rice, and this delicious tofu soup that you can either have with pork, seafood and beef, I'm not sure about the beef though, don't hold me on that one. But seriously, it's just good, really, really good.   I'm also a huge fan of their rice cakes, and also just tried their galbi the other night, and it was delicious, as it should be! Carmalized, tender and marinated to perfection! The grilled mackerel is also spot on!  The banchans are fresh, and tasty all the time, which I love. Great service, and the prices roam from about $3.99 to the $20's if you choose to get the table top bbqs/soups, which is also one of the things I plan on trying every soon from Ga Bin!  We will forever come here!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   My go-to for korean, just because it's so close by and quick. Haven't tried too many korean restaurants, but this one is good in my opinion. I usually grab take out and order a tofu soup. The order also comes with all their side dishes for take out too. Staff is suuper friendly, very sweet people."}
{"text":"1. Excellent Customer Service Very friendly staff and they attend to your needs quite quickly. They're also really busy so I wasn't expecting the staff to be so helpful as they're usually rushing around... too busy to even notice you need something but this place was pretty good at managing that.  2. Delicious food I had the pork bone soup and loved it. I asked for reduced spiciness and they were able to do that perfectly, it was the perfect level of spiciness, tasty but not burning your mouth.   3. Amazing apps They sweet potatoes were lightly fried, I've never had it fried before and it was just amazing. It was disappointing because it went so quickly and they had no more. Their glass noodles were really good too.  4. Good prices and helpful extensive menu They don't gauge you on things like pop. $1-$2 depending on what you get. Standard pricing for their food but very helpful. There's pretty much a picture for every item. There are also a lot of choices. This would be a great place for Caucasians who have never tried Korean food before.  I would say this is the best Korean restaurant I've been to in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place for Korean food. It's very authentic and the staff here is awesome. I usually get the pork bone soup which is very filling and the spices make it so delicious. It's very different and it's my favourite one out of all the Korean restaurants I've been to. I would say it is much better than Owl of Minerva.   One of the things I like here the most are the appetizers. They serve a great variety of appetizers and they are so tasty. It keeps me occupied as I wait for my food. It doesn't take very long to come, and the staff are so attentive. I actually know a couple of them because of how many times I go here!   I regularly come here if I'm craving Korean food. The food is dependable, high quality and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Don't order the Sam Gye Tang here.. There is so ginseng at all.. Total rip off for $18.99.. We told the waitress that there was no ginseng in the soup and she asked us what is ginseng.. She then said there is supposed to be a small one in the chicken and pointed to a garlic calling it ginseng.  Will never come here again. I would rather travel to Korea town to have legit Sam Gye Tang.. Even Galleria makes it better than this restaurant"}
{"text":"Had the pork bone soup and it was very tasty! The side dishes and the rice was good as well. I think it was 7.99 and I would say that's good value. My only complaint is that I thought the seats are very uncomfortable.. but that wouldn't stop me from coming back lol :)"}
{"text":"Rating: 3 1/2* The half of star is based on the service.   We came for lunch on a Monday afternoon after spending the morning at the zoo. It was a cold morning so we felt like something comforting to eat and this place was close. This restaurant is located in a plaza full of Chinese businesses. It was fairly busy with only one waitress working the front of the restaurant.   We were promptly seated and we ordered right away since we were hungry. My wife went with the Kimchi chigae, I went with the Jjamppong while my daughter went with the Spicy Pork Lunch Bento box. We also ordered a Donkatsu too.   The food was okay. Nothing exceptional but nothing overly wrong either. The best dish was the Kimchi chigae with the Jjamppong being the most disappointing one. The Jjamppong was sweet instead of being spicy with somewhat generous offer of seafood. However, there was no shrimp. The spicy pork had the same problem. It was sweet instead of being spicy.   Service was adequate along with the prices.   I'm still in search of a great Jjamppong in the GTA...  #26 of 2018"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. This is used to be my go-to place for Korean food. But I will never come back now because the service was awful. The waitress did not communicate well with us and placed the wrong order. She left the plate of food on our table and make it seem like there was nothing wrong and left. When we called her over again, she just rushed over to grab the plate of food and left again(heard her mumbling \"oh my gosh\")  She also threw the soju glasses on the table when she give us the soju.   I have never experienced something like this.    Not recommending anyone to come here"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to spot for pork bone soup in Marrkham. There's good flavour in both the pork and the soup.   The staff are always very welcoming and friendly  and the side dishes are great :). Parking isn't hard to find either."}
{"text":"Because of my sister.  This is my go-to Korean restaurant when I get the cravings. The first time, I ordered the dish called \" Jap-chae\" which is Korean style glass noodles with marinated beef and veggies on the side. The portion size is quite big and pretty consistent. The dish comes with tongs and a separate bowl because the noodles are so long, it's a good dish for sharing. The service was quick even though the resturant was packed and food was delicious!  PROS: Good food - Good price - Friendly staff members - Efficient service - Walking distance, lol!  CONS: I CAN'T stop going there! -.-'  P.S: ANY BEEF dish is highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Now I know why this restaurant still ranked 3.5 stars. During busy time, this restaurant is lack of customer service but I like the food here."}
{"text":"Simple: quick service, polite staff, good food at a decent price.  I'm a regular here"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, no frills, consistently good food. A great place to go for simple Korean food. I've had their table bbq and it is good as well.  I've had many things on their menu. Most ppl get their pork bone soup or pork bone ramen. My personal favorite is the jjamppong"}
{"text":"This restaurant quickly became my Korean go-to restaurant when I'm in the Scarbs-Markham area. It is always bustling and seating is hard to come-by if you're on the fly. Your patience will be greatly rewards once you allow yourself to stop and smell the roses and is willing to wait a bit for seating...or alternatively come at 2-3pm after the lunch time hustle and before the dinner rush. My lovely boyfriend dragged me to this place, and I so appreciated-it's his childhood watering hole.  The service is fast and straight to the point. The food as awesome-though, I've heard they had the missed days, in my particular case, it hit all the right notes. They have all the offerings of a typical Korean restaurant and nothing more unique but the price was beyond reasonable (in comparison). We ordered a GamJaTang, Kampungi, and spicy pork dish. They did these dishes well and I have no complaints. The taste was very typical and portion galore. I loved the ban-chan were very generous and sported fish cakes, seaweed, sweetened potatoes, spinach, and a few others.  We dined to our heart's content, the bill only came to less than $25. I feel that this place is immensely bang for buck and the food is above expectations (it does not fall short in any aspects to its competitors). This is a come one, come all type place! I will definitely recommend this to anyone that frequent this area and to those that what's great Korean food on a budget."}
{"text":"The worst Korean place I have ever seen. I'd probably gave it no star if it's possible. How can a Korean place failed kimbam and soybean paste soup. It's just impossible cuz those are the basic Korean cuisine. Also, minimal service: never get a refill of side dishes, tea, or anything; basically was ignored the whole time. One heads-up for the server: no tip means angry customers. You won't get anything even you constantly pointed it out to me. This place failed me on a freezing pouring night, never gonna return :("}
{"text":"The service here is poor. We had barbecue tonight, the waitress helped us to cut cooked meat into small pcs. At the same time, she put the raw ones together with the cooked ones. That is unprofessional. We felt uncomfortable for that.  It takes forever to get the bills. It is understandable that they are busy. But after we paid the tips, she rushed to our table and even count every single coin in front of us. That is pretty RUDE. For the service she gave us, we paid her literally generously. However, the way she did for the tip counting made us feel disappointed and unsatisfied. We've never been through this type of situation before in any other restaurant.   Not recommended at all. This dinner gave us a real sad experience."}
{"text":"Very solid korean place! I love their pork bone soup and kimchi jigae. It's a bit on the salty side but the flavor is great and price is very reasonable. Love their rice as it is sticky and goes perfect with the dishes. The side dishes are so-so for me and are very typical korean side dishes."}
{"text":"I always go here for decent Korean food. Sometimes they can be busy, it depends of the time of day. They can make your Pork Bone soup less spicy which is good because some places don't. Overall this is a good place to get good korean food if you're looking to spend less."}
{"text":"I came with friend on lunch hour, no waiting, place was clean and foods came out fast. I had marinated beef ribs lunch box and my friend had pork bone soup. Foods and side dishes were delicious.  Good service too :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times because it's close to my house. I believe they are legit Korean because they understand almost no words of english.   I've ordered a variety of things before here and theyre standard. However i did order the Budae Jigae dish once (a big soup dish served with meats and tofu and noodles in it) and it's one of very few places i know that actually serve this dish! Definitely reminds me of when I was in Korea!  This is a place i'd come back to when i'm hungry and don't know where to go, or just feel for some good korean food. It's definitely a safe choice for me."}
{"text":"It is my first time trying this place for a lunch, and i seriously love it. It is in scarborough where you would not expect a lot of korean restaurants. but it is definitely pretty good.  First of all, we had the lunch special as well as a set meal. The price for the food was very good considering what you got quality wise, and also what you get portion wise.   The Pork bone soup had a really great flavor, and was what i remembered some of the older korean restaurants used to have, before it became more generic. The fish that came with it, was also very good set menu. as it is fire grilled in a way that you can definitely taste the fish still, but had a crispness to it.   The Chicken Katsu, was on par with all the other places around, and overall was good, it wasn't exceptional, but exactly what you would expect from a chicken katsu dish,   The Side dishes provided there were some great ones, included a sweet crispy potato that had us asking for seconds and perhaps 3rd if we had more people.   Overall for the price you get, and the quality, i think this is a very good korean restaurant, and would definitely recommend for others to try. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other food."}
{"text":"Traditionally, a gathering with my Family Relatives would be held at one of the many Cantonese restaurants within the Markham/Scarborough area.  There's almost never a second thought about it as it usually offers delicious sharable Food at a reasonable price-range while giving everybody that recognizable flavour profile that they grew up on.  This time around we(I) decided to venture outside the box but considering that Ga Bin Korean is right in the middle of a Chinese plaza, it's not too far a stretch.  What I learned in this instance is that sharing some Korean dishes amongst a larger group has slightly more challenges than Chinese dishes.  #4 on Back Menu.  Selection of items(for Group)  Banchans   -   That Potato Dish is definitely tasty sweet with the texture of Fried Potato while enveloped in some sort of sugar coating almost resembling Maple Syrup in color.

{"text":"Came here during lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy, but I like how they have lunch specials.  I can't normally have these on weekdays since I have to work.   The service here is pretty good, they are attentive, but when it gets busy, there's only like 2 people looking after the whole floor.   They have table cooking, which I have tried during dinner! Very good, and very filling, and smokeless grills.   I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box today to try, whereas my boyfriend got the eel bibimbap in a stone pot.   The chicken teriyaki (7.99) came with a good share to sliced chicken charcoaled, with salad, rice and 2 pieces of orange. I found the chicken a little too burnt. It had that bitter taste.  I have had their galbi for lunch and it's very good and marinated.  I wanted to try something different this time, but I think next time I will stick with galbi, or something more Korean.    My boyfriends eel bibimbap had a nice crust to the rice, with a good share of eel and eel sauce.  Blended very well when mixed together.   What I love about this place is the side dishes.  We got 7 side dishes, I think dinner they have a couple more.  My favourite is the potato with a sweet crust! It's like candy potatoes.  And I always order another one, since they are ayce.   Nice place to come for Korean food for a reasonable price and yummy sides!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are frequent lunch diners at Ga Bin, so much so that the waitress/owner (?) recognizes our group and especially my two kids :) It's great to have a Korean restaurant in this plaza and the price is right! The Kam Ja Tang is delicious and very affordable but my favourite thing to order is the Kalbi lunch special. It comes in a bento box with rice and salad, and fruit too. The meat is cut up so you don't have to fiddle with the bones (perfect for when I'm holding my infant with in my lap). The meat is perfectly carmelized and has fantastic flavour. The rice is the perfect doneness and they have delicious (refillable) banchan (appetizers)! It's great to support a mom and pop-type of establishment like this."}
{"text":"You have to try their Kimchi Bibimbap.  It's really freaking tasty. If you're looking for a decent Korean restaurant uptown that isn't down by Yonge and Finch, Ga Bin is it. There is so much variety to choose from and their unlimited side dishes are tough to beat (their crispy potatoes are THE best). The only thing I wish they would introduce into their menu is kimbap, Korean sushi. That really is the only thing they are missing. But everything I've had from their menu has not disappointed. You can't go wrong with their bibimbap, and they are pretty good about accommodating vegans.   One thing that might throw some people off is the poor ventilation. The place is quite small, so air circulation isn't great. They have table bbq, which often gets quite smokey, so shy away from wearing thick knits that'll absorb the smells for an eternity."}
{"text":"My go-to Korean restaurant in Scarbaria. Service is efficient and food is always great. Prices are reasonable, and portions are fairly big. I always order the black bean noodle or the seafood noodle. Once in a while, the classic bibimbap :)"}
{"text":"Pictures do not equate. Sad.   Grandpa wanted the pretty kalbi in the picture. Imagine rolls of boneless short rib with lovely marbling. Four of them in the picture. $21.99. We ordered it and got a small plate of what very well could have just been any other cut of beef, not particularly marbled, sitting atop of two big rib bones (thereby reducing what was already a small portion of meat). Meat wasn't particularly fresh looking or tasting. At $21.99, I might as well do AYCE for that portion and quality, especially as this was the most expensive cut of meat they had available for grilling.   Pork Rib, on the other hand, came with two big pork chops for $12.99. I'd do that one again. Juicy, and pre-cooked, so your only job is to reheat it on your grill.  Tabletop BBQ requires 2 orders of grilling meat, although the two can be different kinds of meat. Comes with lettuce. Extras come at a cost. Option of adding a soup (pork bone, tofu or bean paste) and two bowls of rice for $7. I would advise it. We ordered the PBS. Big bowl of it. At least three/four bones. It was decent, although it could have been flavored better. Kinda felt like they boiled the bones in water, then dumped them into a soup base. Don't actually know though.  Soup (pork bone, tofu, or bean paste) with grilled mackerel ($9.99) - small bowl of PBS (two smaller bones). Grilled mackerel was tender and the skin was crispy. Bone in. Decent sized fillet. Also came with rice.  Haemul Pajeon ($8.99) - seafood pancake. Lacking in the seafood department. Lots of green onion. Too thick. Good portion though. Taste was okay. A tad doughy.  Banchans - kimchi, seaweed, sweet potato pancake, caramelized fried potato, japchae, sprouts, radish, one more I forget.  They need more servers. I'll probably be back though. Food was decent. Prices were also, for the most part, decent."}
{"text":"Way long overdue review! I came here for the first time in may 2014, when my current bf took me here for our first date. Ever since then, I've been obsessed! Service is always prompt and we never have to wait too long for menus, our food or the bill. They always play running man, so there's always something interesting to watch when you eat, especially if you're alone. Only thing is that.. the booths are weird.. the tables are too short while the seats are too tall.. I can't imagine a tall kobe-like customer eating in the booth comfortably. The ratio is just off.   Food is brill. They have smoke free kbbq, which I've yet to try, but it sounds good! Great samgyupsal without the smelly barbeque stench sitting in your hair the whole day? Sounds good.. will try next time. The thing is, I always end up getting their bibambap, because it is the absolute BEST one in the GTA. Always get the hot stone one, because the stone dish is so hot that it fries and crisps the rice just perfectly. Geez, I love hearing the sound of crispy bibambap coming my way. I like the chicken one! Everything about it is just so delicious and flavourful, and that's coming from an asian who's not a fan of rice. Apparently the gamjatang is amazing as well- bf always gets it and says the pork is the softest thing ever, and just falls right off the bone. Sounds good, right?!?! The side dishes are plentiful and yummy, but not always tasting super fresh.   I always end up coming here if I'm in the area, because it's just SO good!"}
{"text":"Just got take out but so far so good. Very fast service. They said around 10-15mins but I didn't wait long at all. I got the japchae and the spicy pork on rice. Hit the spot so that's a good sign. Another good sign was the place quickly packed with well... Koreans. So that's good too. Looks like this place is frequented by local tastes. I want to go back and try their BBQ option. Looks promising :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a several times and I have tried more than half of their menu items. I can say I have no disappointment so far, no matter the taste or the price.   Their Korean style BBQ is very good, I like the pork belly the best. It is tender, but not too over cook nor too oily. My second favourite food is the spicy stir fry pork belly with kimchi. The latest time I went there with friend was for lunch. We ordered a combo set with pork bone soup and grilled mackerel and chicken katsu. I always love their pork bone soup. Their pork bone soup has the flavour that those older Korean restaurants used to do. The grill mackerel is fire grilled, very tasty and crispy.   Overall, it's a very good Korean restaurant. If you haven't tried or only tried once, it definitely worth going, repeatedly."}
{"text":"Both my boyfriend and I came into the restaurant for lunch today as this was one of the higher reviewed Korean restaurants in Markham.  I ordered a pork bone soup and he ordered a beef rib soup. Both tasted like we would expect it to but they were served with white rice instead of purple rice. They also didn't have the pepper flakes that I was used to having in K town. However I will stick to satisfy my Korean food cravings at Yonge and Finch from now on as I had a stomach ache immediately after my meal"}
{"text":"The services are terrible, it took me some time to figure out if I owe them any money. The waitress gives us shit faces for no reason..."}
{"text":"i actually quite liked this restaurant. it kind of reminded me a bit of seoul garden which used to be near pacific mall. so i went here two times and food wise, i really liked ( i got the oxtail soup and kimchi jigae and the gamjatang) oh their side dishes were pretty standard except for the caramelized potatoes (GOD DIGGITY GOOD) a few things I didn't like about this restaurant are their lack of servers, patience and the fact I have to order two orders of samgyupsal or other meat options to be able to grill them meat like ????!! WHY!'"}
{"text":"somehow they managed to mess up a bibimbap...it was totally bland seafood jajangmyun was awful as well  burnt taste in the watery sauce  a completely different dish than the one at Songcook's"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the pork bone soup for only $7.99. This is cheaper compared to other Korean places I've been to. Although it's cheaper, they don't skimp when it comes to portion sizes. There was lots of tender meat on my pork bone. This dish does come with white rice (as opposed to the purple rice I prefer but that's not a deal breaker).   Only 2 waiters work here but it is a relatively small restaurant so it wasn't too hard getting their attention although they are always quite busy. The waiters here are quick and efficient. It only took 10 minutes for the food to come!   Side dishes included sweet potatoes that I found was coated in much more sugar than I'm used to. The other dishes were average. Nothing really worth mentioning.   There are 8 long booths (which can sit 6) with tabletop cooking along the sides and 4 tables that seats 6 along the center. It would be much easier to get a table here if you're in group of 6 or less. They do combine tables when you have larger groups but you probably have to wait longer for 2 tables to clear.   This place will probably become my go-to Korean restaurant because of the cheap prices. I will be back soon to try everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a few days ago. We ordered the pork bone soup and eel bibimbap. Everything was decent. Nothing impressive though. We did find a strand of hair in our potato appetizer which was a bit disappointing. I have been here a couple of times before and this was the first time we found hair in our food so hopefully this is only a one-time thing. I do have my own share of hair-in-food experiences from chinese diners so this did not bother me too much. Overall, this is an ok korean restaurant. Come if you are in the area but don't travel far for it."}
{"text":"Reading through the reviews I can see i wasn't the only one who experienced this. This was my second time here. My friend and I really enjoy the ribs here. When it came time to pay I didn't tip. The waitress was not friendly at all. I get that your busy but atleast be nice.  I paid with visa and she told me I had to pay a 10% tip. I was shocked. I have never been forced to tip. I told her i didnt have cash and she said I should use my visa again to tip her the 4 or 5 dollars. Then when i wouldnt......Im not exaggerating she actually just stared at me with disgust for almost 20 seconds straight. Then another woman came up to tell me usually people give 10% and i told her yes but its optional and with the way the waitress is behaving she does not deserve anything and I turned around and walked away.   I do not recommend this place and will never go back there again!"}
{"text":"As we entered on a weekend during peak lunch hours, there was only one table of customers there. My group was told to seat ourselves so we did. The serv  The servers brought over some menus and water. Service seems quick. Their offerings are the usual korean dishes you get in the GTA and prices are comparable. They have lunch specials daily but the selection of lunch specials are extremely limited. My group ordered the mackerel fish and the gamjatang in the bigger size.   Food:  Gamjatang- The gamjatang was sooo bland. I usually find it very flavorful at other popular restaurants. But their gamjatang was very bland. I wasn't very impressed with the food.   Mackerel- typical and it was exactly what I expected.   Service: The service was horrible. We asked for more of the side dishes and the server asked us \"which ones?\".  We listed a few and then she walks off without acknowledging, as if she's mad for us asking. She then brings it back and she had this unhappy face. When we paid the bill, she did not say anything. She just gave us the card machine and we paid. After paying, she took the machine and walked off without saying a thank you or anything. I don't know why servers are soooo rude. Their mannerism is horrible. With service like this, I don't see why people will come because it is just ridiculous how rude they were."}
{"text":"Consistent and yummy :) I quite enjoyed the pork bone soup and I like that they let you do a combo option with a small soup and small portion of meat. Get to try the best of both worlds!  The banchan here is delicious and there's plenty of options. I'm never a fan of their kimchi though and I really love kimchi usually.   The staff are friendly and the place is quite clean. I'd keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here a lot and we are never disappointed with the food. We usually get their bulgogi and soup combo (which we can now get pork bone soup with) or their pork bone soup hot pot that we both share. We are always full and very satisfied after every meal! The service is great as they're always attentive and they will give you more side dish if you ask.   It usually gets really busy during dinner time so you'd probably need to wait around 10-20 minutes before being seated but that isn't a long period of time and their food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place overall. Been hesitant to try the food here but damn it was good! I ordered the beef bibimbap for lunch (get it with the stone-cooked bowl). To the honest, I will come back here if given the chance :)"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for Korean food. My girlfriend likes their Pork Bone Soup and side dishes. I ordered a Jajang Noodles.  The Noodles come with the sauce scooped onto the side, tossed with seafood (small mussels and squid) and comes with two (regular sized) mussels and topped with an egg. I like to cut up the egg and then mix everything together.  The flavour of the sauce and noodles are tasty but I find the seafood bits themselves sometimes better than others. I like how there's plenty of sauce, and the texture of the noodles."}
{"text":"A solid Korean restaurant for dependable service and food. I've been here multiple times in the past, most recently the past Sunday for lunch. The place was packed, but the two ladies working the floor was fast and kept the tables moving. We had seats for our group of 5 in 5 minutes.   The side dishes are always good here, my favorites being the caramalized potatoes chunks and the kimchi. I had the Don Katsu lunch set, which came out after tax and tip at $10. A good deal for the amout of food you get. It was perfectly crispy and paired great with the side dishes.   It may be a bit hard to flag down the ladies when they are flying around, but they are really polite and quick when you can get their attention.  Our table was never out of tea even though the place was packed, it was impressive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today on the recommendation of the person that helped us out when buying a phone case at PAC Mall.  Parking - no problems even at lunchtime  Seated quickly Service was quick and friendly Menu - extensive Ordered: Spicy pork lunch special  Pork bone soup Mandu   Good.  Good.  Ok - it's mandu, hard to mess up  Husband actually liked his PBS which is unusual.  He has \"meh'd \" all but one other PBS.     Spicy pork was not spicy but still good.  As usual, I ate too much banchan and not enough of my generous serving of food.   So now I have lunch for tomorrow."}
{"text":"We ordered a seafood hot stone bibimbap, a chicken bento box and a pork bone ramen.    The Good:  It is a meal of subpar food but good value.  Everything about the food was just okay.  The ingredients were not particularly fresh or good nor were they bad.  The flavours were average at best.  The pricing was quite cheap, though.  The food portion was good.  The services was acceptable.  I give 2 stars for this.  The Seriously Bad: The one thing that disgusted me is the restroom.  There is a sign asking people to not put toilet paper into the toilet but into the waste basket instead.  Please don't misinterpret it as \"paper towel\" as I did.  They really mean toilet paper, as in after it has been used for businesses, both types.  I made the mistake of putting toilet paper after doing a \"major businesses\" into the toilet.  The damn thing wouldn't flush.  I told one of the workers.  She said it was my fault.  Couldn't I read the English sign?  Like as if I would put smelly, bacteria infested toilet paper into an open air waste basket (I should have taken a picture, but trust me that the waste basket has no cover).  Totally unacceptable and unhygienic practice in a food establishment.    It is the owner's responsibility to repair and upgrade the facility.  Asking customers to put soiled toilet paper into an open cover waste basket is unacceptable.  Making your workers regularly clean a flooded toilet because you are too cheap to get a handyman in is unacceptable.  I won't return.  I can't dine at establishments with disgusting toilets."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean restaurant with great sides and excellent pork bone soup. The lunch time menu is a pretty good deal considering the price of Kalbi at other authentic Korean restaurants - here it is $12 for a bento box at lunch! The pork bone soup is quite good as well, the meat is not over cooked and the soup is tasty. Comes with a rice so you wouldn't leave the place starving. However I wouldn't say it's the best Korean I've ever had, but it is quite good for the location. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Service was a bit slower today as there were only two waitresses. While the restaurant is a bit smaller, 2 was not enough and they were clearly understaffed.   We ordered pork bone soup ($7.99) and Tteokboki ($8.99) to share. Their prices are cheaper in comparison to other korean restaurants (pork bone soup typically costs $10 at other establishments). The pork bone soup comes with a side of rice and it was generously portioned with 5 pieces of pork. The Tteokboki wasn't as good. It was chewy, but it was also harder/denser than what I've had at other restaurants. I would not recommend.   As usual, there are free refills on their banchan. I found their bean sprouts side weren't that fresh but the rest tasted fine!   Overall, their food is cheaper in comparison to other korean restaurants. While their tteoboki was a bit of a disappointment, their pork bone soup was good and I would come back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Going to keep this short.  Service: Friendly. Actually run by Koreans! Side dishes: These were so addicting. I have no idea why. We kept ordering the fish cakes because for some reason they were really good. The potatoes were odd though... mush on the inside but like kind of hard on the outside? But other than that the side dishes were great. Food: I ordered a bulgogi with rice and he ordered a donkatsu with rice. Taste wise both were   good. Bulgogi was very sweet and the meat was soft. Donkatsu was breaded well and tasted good but it was SO thin. Like paper thin. Like they rolled it to make the meat flat. I accidentally deleted my pictures of it. There was no meat to bite into. Not worth it. Lots of MSG in both. We were so thirsty afterwards. Price: It's okay. Not very cheap but won't break the bank... portion wise I thought it was expensive. I'm a small eater and I could have polished off my dish (I usually leave half).   I won't be back as there are other options for Korean around. But this place is okay in general."}
{"text":"Was craving Korean and decided to try this place out for some pork bone soup and spicy pan fried pork.  Both were less than satisfying as the flavours of both our mains and their banchans were very one dimensional.    The pork bone soup broth just lacked any complexity in flavour even with the palpable msg pang.  The stir fried pork arrived on a sizzling plate and this dish too got boring pretty fast after a few bites.    The banchans arrive in super tiny portions and it was annoying to have to flag the servers down for refills (4 times during our short meal).  Oh, and whoever said this place has the best kimchi, has never had good kimchi.  The flavours of the banchans were flat out on the non-yum side.    Sure, it may not break the bank for a filling meal here but then why not just stuff yourself with a bowl of boiled potatoes at home....  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a pork bone soup and also a kimchii pancake. I have had so many pork bone soups in other Korean restaurants and this one taste just as good as the others. I always tempted to get a kimchii pancake and this time I finally got one. Can't say I was really impressed. It always looks so good in the picture. Mental note, kimchii pancakes are not my thing. It was like a pancake but stuffed with chopped seafood and onions."}
{"text":"Ordered samgyeopsal and was disappointed by this. Their grill was so-so and they charged for the lettuce! I guess that's why they charge cheaper in comparison to other restos. The thing I enjoy most here is the kimchi chigae. Also, price is reasonable."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a typical Korean restaurant in terms of decor and variety of food is larger than some places I've been to.  A friend suggested to go to Ga Bin since I've never gone and I really like the food here. The appetizers were average but the potatoes as mentioned from another reviewer was fried and sweet on the inside; different than most Korean restaurants.   We ordered; Kimchi pancake, Gamjatang and Soon Tofu. As per my friend's comments the Gamjatang was more spicy than other places and the flavour was really good. The Soon Tofu was very good, I've gone to Oh Geul Boh Geul and it was salty; but here at Ga Bin it was perfect and they were generous in portions in terms of tofu, veggies, etc. I would recommend this place to others and would most definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is a small place near pmall. However definitely a must try if you in the mood for Korean!  Been here couple times and usually the food is quite good or at least the food I've ordered is quite good haha. Small place so don't expect like parties of 40. Probably sits roughly 20-30 people. They share parking lots with destiny and the other places there so lots of parking!    They place Korean shows or game shows and those are pretty cool if you can understand the game or language haha. The staff is friendly and the side dishes are goooooooood. Hmm so good haha I usually get bibimbap but today I got some grilled chicken with pork bone soup hmm heavenly.  I haven't tried the other stuff but I think it'll be spot on when I do. Will probably come back to try the table cooking! Till then cheers!"}
{"text":"Never noticed a Korean restaurant here before but thanks to Yelp I found this place. I'm really glad because this place is super close to me. This is very important especially when I have sudden Korean food cravings at random times. We ordered the pork soon tofu soup and the chicken bimbimbap. both of which were really good. This is a great place to get your Korean food craving satisfied if you live in the area :)"}
{"text":"Came back recently, besides the price increase, I find the quality of the kalbi has declined, probably wouldn't come back for lunch again. $17 + tax is getting a little pricey!  Also the salad they served was a bit soggy, and my family seemed to have upset stomachs as well after eating here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. They have good prices and food is quite authentic. We tried the pork bone soup and beef bulgogi for dinner. Pork bone soup has good heat with good flavors, bulgogi has a yummy taste to it. This place can get busy and they only have two waitresses, so be patient. All in all, this is one of the better choices for Korean food in this area."}
{"text":"Yummy Korean food for a reasonable price!   I got the Unagj Bibimbap on a hot stone bowl and it was delicious. Ratio of vegetables to meat was 3:2, but the price was much cheaper compared to other restaurants.   They also served complimentary side dishes, which was a bonus!"}
{"text":"Just an average Korean restaurant in my area. Food is 3/3.5 stars, whereas service is a hit and miss.   I got the bibimbap and my friend got the tonkatsu meal. We both tried each other's food and concluded that both were really bland.   Really disappointed in recent visits as the food did not taste as good as before.   On the bright side, they are generous with side dishes. They will refill the side dishes as per your request!  I don't think I'll go back to this Korean restaurant unless... I'm lazy to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you came here to satisfy your craving for Authentic Korean food - DONT.  It took me 3 tries to finally come up with a review. Im just happy I am  able to write a good one on the 3rd eat. The first 2 time I had tried this place, I had high high expectations with other Korean places in mind which made me go home confused and disappointed. on my 3rd try I came here thinking dinner was going to be bad, but lo and behold we actually enjoyed ourselves. No Fuss Korean diner I would call it .  We had the usual Gamjatang (pork bone soup) which fell off the bone - Great! big portion too. Kampoongki (sweet , sour and spicy chicken) - Crunchy and sweet sauce, not so much the \"spicy\" you'd expect; Seafood Pancake - one of the better ones I have tried. It had that layer of Crunchiness which made it delicious.  JapChae was well seasoned and certainly hit the spot right. Don Katsu was big and tender. Special Mention to their service tea, clear and good flavour.  Service was quick albeit not very friendly. They also seem to serve aged meat BBQ. The big aging machine that meets you at the doorway piqued my interest as well as the BBQ grill that is smokeless. At least I think it is .  We didn't smell the smoke when we came in  nor did our Jackets reek of roasted meat when we left. Would definitely be back to give it a try.   I'd like to end this review with a word of caution to Smoking Korean Spicy Seekers - bring your own chilli flakes or order one. The food has all the korean flavours sans the bite/kick. For those that don't like Korean Food because its mostly spicy - I'd give this place a try asap."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Korean food at an affordable price, this is the place to go. Not the most spicy in the world, at least not the few plates I've tried but the food is good and clean"}
{"text":"I love eating here with my friends. There food is consistent and they always refill your side dishes as they pass by.  The food is fair for the price. I always get the usual pork bone soup and I have no complaints. The cutlet's aren't bad either."}
{"text":"The good: I would have to say this is one of my favourite Korean restaurants to go to. I love their side dishes and their food is pretty tasty. When you go late at night, they even give you extra. They are fairly friendly and the prices are reasonable.   The bad: Not much. It's not a restaurant that will wow you but it's a good Korean restaurant in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Based on food alone I would give it 3 stars, but for service it would have to be 2 stars. Came on a Saturday night and it was crazy busy. The restaurant seems to be understaffed as there were only two servers on the floor with a full house. It was extremely difficult to get the attention of any server. Usually at Korean restaurants the side dishes come out a few minutes after you order, but because it was so busy our server must've forgotten because it came out 15 minutes later along with our appetizer and mains.   The food was only okay, I've had better. The side dishes we got was the typical seaweed, salad, potatoes, glass noodles etc. If you want the side dishes refilled they refill all of them instead of the usual choose only 3 refill at some places. I got the bulgogi beef set, which came with tofu soup and rice. The portions are smaller than usual because it's a set but it was $12.99 which was decent! The tofu soup was salty and a little too oily, and the bulgogi wasn't as sweet as it should be, not much flavour really. My girlfriend got the kimchi bibimbap with cheese and chicken. They have realllyyyyy good kimchi so that dish was good. We kept ordering sides of kimchi alone because it was that tasty. I would also recommend their rice cakes-perfect chewiness and spiciness!    They have a wide selection of foods available so it was hard to choose what to get! They have kbbq and the table next to us was eating it and it smelled so good. If we do decide to come back it would be for the grill.   Just a tip: if you're in a rush to leave just go up to the counter to pay. Especially when it's incredibly busy it'll take longer than usual to settle a bill."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars There was a total of 7 banchan (side dishes) and my favourite was the potato cubes in a crispy sugary coat. It's a little sweeter than most other Korean restaurants but I have a big sweet tooth so it suited me well. I just wish the potatoes were a little warmer. I found the glass noodles absolutely tasteless so I would rate that as the worst of the side dishes.  I wasn't feeling overly adventurous so I stuck with my pork bone soup. I think I got up to 4 pieces of pork bone so there was plenty of meat! Meat was quite tender and I could only finish half of my pork bone soup before surrendering it to my boyfriend. He got J3 (seasoned marinated sirloin beef served with soybean (or soft tofu) soup. I personally didn't find his sirloin beef appealing so I opted out when he offered me some. I did try some of his soybean soup near the end of our meals and it was really yummy! A little salty but that's what made it taste so goooood. Will definitely come back for their pork bone soup and maybe try something else on their menu, which is pretty extensive.  Ambiance: 3.5 stars Nice simple Korean restaurant. I like how they have these little black seat pads so your butt doesn't hurt from the wooden booths. They have this really cool electric grill at our table and now I'm interested in going back to try it out! Not sure if it's common but I haven't seen it anywhere else.   Service: 3.5 stars The ladies serving our table were quick and each time we ordered for more potatoes, they gave it to us promptly. One lady spoke enough English to take our orders but didn't understand my boyfriend when he asked if there was any MSG in their soybean soup."}
{"text":"i've only had pork bone soup from this place. it's pretty standard. hard to do pork bone soup wrong. the owners are korean if you worry about authenticity. they have renovated the place since they first opened. it's still a very tiny place. if your like me and just want a cheap filling tasty meal, this place is for you."}
{"text":"First time today and definitely not the last. We ordered pork bone soup $9.99, mackerel + pork bone soup combo $13.99, beef bulgogi + pork bone soup combo $15.99.  Just enough kick for pork bone soup. Actually my husband loved it and stated it is the best by far. Mind you we had pork bone soup before including the ones in koreantown. Mackerel is good. Beef bulbogi has enough sweetness on it. The bachan?! They don't skimp on bachan. Free refill and big portions. Very busy from opening till around 3pm. Dont know how it is in the evening. Took out 1 star because they offered baby seat but forget about it so i took one from the corner and sat my baby. But when the lunch hour died down, servers are easily available. I would come back for their pork bone soup, banchan and will try other dishes."}
{"text":"It's one of the many Korean Restaurants in town.  Good service, decent price, typical selection. Recently started advertising that they have smoke-free KBBQ. You definitely don't choke inside from the smoke, but you still come outside smelling like it. I don't mind the place, especially since i think they have pretty good ban chan (side dishes), albeit small in quantity."}
{"text":"The first time we came here was for their Korean barbecue. It was delicious and affordable that we decided to come back again after a month later.  This time, we asked for the same thing but was told that they took that out of their menu and replaced it with their \"new dry aged meat\". First of all, what we wanted was never taken off the menu and was still visible on the menu. We decided that we will give the dry aged meat a try since we were craving Korean barbecue that night.   Before we ordered, we asked one of the waitresses how big the portion would be. She had told us that one order of meat would be equivalent to what it used to be (one full big plate). We decided to order the New York stirloin (claimed to be aged about 40 days) and the pork belly (aged about 10 days). When our food came, everything was on one plate - we received 3 pieces of beef and around 10 pieces of pork belly plus a few pieces of vegetables. MIND YOU, the New York stirloin was $59.99 (that's $20 per piece lol) and the pork belly was $39.99. From looking at it, we were already very skepitcal as the cut of the meat looked like any other meat you could buy at the grocery store. We thought, okay since it is dry aged it better be good.   One of the waitresses cooked the meat for us. The pork belly was mediocre. Nothing special about it. But the beef was absolutely terrible. It was over cooked and not tender at all. We could not even finish it. The meat was no different at all to any other meat you could get and cook for yourself at a grocery store. When we told the waitress about how bad the stirloin was, all she said was sorry and that it was her cooking that was bad. We did not get any compensation for it whatsoever.  For the price of what it was, I definitely expected WAY BETTER quality meat. We basically only ate their unlimited side dishes that night. When we left the restaurant , there was a sign by the door that said the meat had only been dry aged since July 1st (1 week before we visited the restaurant). I cannot believe they had the odacity to sell us their meat that had not been aged of what they claim it to be and NOT tell us about it.   We used to love this restaurant for their affordable table cooking BBQ. It used to be the only good Korean style table top cooking BBQ in Markham, not situated in midtown or downtown. But after this experience, we will definitely not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Ga Bin Korean Restaurant is surrounded by Chinese restaurant in one of the Plaza at Silver Star Blvd. and Steeles.   It is owned and runned by Korean. They have been doing this Pork Bone Soup Specials for $5.00 that includes a pop for the longest time. I have to say it is a great value but from July on it will be $5.99 instead.  Dropped by on a weekday afternoon for lunch. The restaurant is nice, clean and empty. When it is hot and sunny, I always want to have the Korean Cold Noodle Soup. And luckily this is on the lunch menu.  I have to say Ga Bin makes one of the best Cold Noodle Soup ($7.99) I have ate. It is served in this metal bowl with ice in my soup. The noodle is nice and chewy..and there is 2 slice of watermelon in the soup too. I love the pickled cabbage. A little spicy, a little garlicky and so refreshing.   The beef in it is not too good. I would have ask them to skip that next time.  The service is fast and friendly. I will definitely be back to try out other lunch specials.. or order the Cold Noodle Soup again!  They accepts Visa, Mastercard or Interac for bills over $10."}
{"text":"It's one of those nights where you crave for some korean and you're living all the way from ajax and you just had to go. This is the closest we can find and it's not bad. It's not pricey and the servings are huge. The seafood pancake was fantastic. It's cheaper and bigger compared to other korean places. I just wish we got more soup from the gamjatang. Service is not bad, and the side dishes are pretty filling and a lot as well."}
{"text":"Monday lunch, around noon. Why did I come back? Because of the convenience. And I feel as though that's where they get most of their business.  I ordered the deep fried dumplings. Then I asked if I could get the Jap Chae with chicken instead of beef. The lady said no, beef. So I went on to say, oh ok so it only comes with beef? And she said yes. So then I proceeded to tell her I will have the stir fried chicken udon (while gesturing to the item on the menu). My father ordered the ox tail soup with rice. My mother ordered pork bone Ramen.  When the food came, the first dish was the beef Jap Chae. I told her I ordered the stir fried chicken udon. Basically, she thought I wanted both. When I told her that I never indicated I wanted that item, and that I only asked her about it, she seemed really annoyed to have to take it back. I was not pleased. I wanted to leave right then and there. Had I been with my husband instead, I would have.  To be \"fair,\" she did read out the letters/numbers of the food items back to us. How are we supposed to keep up with a call back like \"A11 H38 B13 G44 R33 with chicken.\" (these are not the exact characters, however, similar style). All I heard was \"with chicken,\" which meant it was my stir fried chicken udon (because choices were chicken or seafood). First of all, she did not call the order back in order. If she did, my order would have been called second, not last. You can't expect me to know what characters belong to which dishes, especially when it's not in order. This just brings confusion to a whole new level. Second of all, it's not my job to know the characters and the dishes. You need to read the actual dishes back.  The food itself. The side dishes were average. Nothing special.  The deep fried dumplings were okay. For the price, it's good. The filling was bland but deep frying anything will up its game.  My stir fried chicken udon was pretty tasty. I did like it; tastier than average.  My dad's oxtail soup seemed kind of \"dinky\" - not a lot of substance to it, a few pieces of bones with some meat. He said he probably would have rather ordered the regular pork bone soup.  My mom's pork bone Ramen was okay. She actually didn't know it was Ramen. Apparently, in the Cantonese translation, it did not indicate that it was Ramen, but rather, it indicated it was like a home made stretchy noodle?? I'm not too sure what she meant, but she said the translation written in Cantonese was not Ramen. You can be the judge. The item she ordered was on a separate laminated double sided menu (apart from the main menu).   The lady said bye as we left. I'll give her that. But I felt uncomfortable being there. I'm glad the food came out as she took the Jap Chae back in because I'm paranoid about spit being spat in food."}
{"text":"Food is very good! Came in for soondubu and that was good but too salty. The pork bone soup is fantastic and the banchans were very good too! I would definitely come back to try more on the menu! Please be mindful that they are very under staffed and they are trying their best to accommodate to everyone, the women are very nice people. Just be patient."}
{"text":"This place is really good, and the food comes fast and very tasty. Minimal waiting time at the door the couple of times I have been there to eat. The price is not too bad for the food. I would definitely go there again to eat."}
{"text":"There's always this one dish I get here, but the name is slipping my mind at the moment. It's spicy pork on a hot plate or something like that. There's a good amount of meat that comes with this dish, and the amount of spice is just right. It is a little bit oily (and by a little I mean a lot), but they give you rice to eat it with, so that's not too bad.  Having been at Ga Bin multiple times (both dine in and take out), their food and service is consistently good. I have never had to wait too long, and they give an ample amount of side dishes (even if it's take out). The service is nothing special, but there's nothing wrong about it either.   I would definitely recommend this place, but be warned that it can get busy in the evenings."}
{"text":"Based on food alone, I would give Ga Bin 4 stars, but service dragged the overall rating down to 3 or 3.5*  The main problem is that the restaurant appears to be very understaffed. I came with my mom on a Sunday night and it was fairly busy, and we only had two employees manning the whole place. Because of that, service was slow, and it was quite difficult to get a server's attention. Although I would add that the servers were very friendly.   Service issues aside, I was quite pleased with the food. Between my mom and I, we ordered a seafood tofu soup, spicy rice cake, and a bibimbap. All were excellent and we got plentiful refills of banchan. Portions are good and we ended up packing almost half of our meal home for leftovers the next day.   All in all, I would come back to Ga Bin - it's a good option for Korean outside of the Finch and Yonge area. However, I'd avoid peak hours if possible!"}
{"text":"Great place for PBS. The thing that stands out are the side dishes. They are just amazing at this place.  The reason for taking away a star is that their PBS hardly has any potato in it.   Will always be up to going here if you wanna go let me know"}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and never had to wait for more than a couple minutes for a table. The servers are all Korean and they seem to be in a bit of a rush when taking orders. There's a TV on the wall playing Korean shows, with no subtitles.  There's BBQ on the menu but never tried it. Got seven little side dishes and two entrees. Lunch bentos are available or the combo special, which is a very good choice. Comes with a dish, a choice of pork bone or tofu soup and rice. A very filling meal for one person. The standard for the food has remained consistent for each visit. The Korean food was delicious and well seasoned. The dumplings are completely fried and very crispy, a good appetizer to munch on.  Overall, will definitely be back for some good Korean food."}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean restaurant I go to in the GTA. Did I forget to mention it is actually authentic korean, not a chinese run korean place.  Service: It is always great service. Never slow at all despite even going during peak hours. Your food always comes fast or at an acceptable time and your server will always be there if you need something.  Food: Best authentic korean food for your buck and more. Better than Owl of Minerva by far.  Venue: Its a nice small cozy venue. The seats are hard and far from the table which can cause a little discomfort, but thisnis the only complaint I can think of.  TLDR; Best bang for your buck korean restaurant and more. I am a regular customer and would recommend you to try it out."}
