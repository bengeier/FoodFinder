{"text":"One star is too many for this place. We just went for the first time tonight. Our waitress was slow and lazy. We waited 15minutes before the server \"noticed\" us (she was busy talking to coworkers). We ordered some sushi and spring rolls. The sushi is cheap and skimpy, spring rolls were bland. We ate less than 1/2 the sushi and sat waiting for our server to check on us (still busy talking to coworkers). With no more to drink and sitting, waiting to get help for 1/2 hour, the server finally noticed us glaring at her and came over to see if we wanted anything else. We said \"no\" because nothing was good. She left saying nothing and after 10 minutes just dropped our check at the table. We were comped a good portion of the bill, but no manager came to see us and the waitress never mentioned it. Really all they needed to do is not ignore us and if they would have checked in shortly after we were served, we could have tried something else and maybe saved the meal. We will not be back.  In summation, the food was poor quality, the service was awful, management is mia. No idea how this place stays open."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cenpho sushi place. Other than Hana which is awesome. I really enjoy the spicy edamame and the jalepenko roll. I have not had anything bad though. We go once a Month or so and usually share some rolls. The people are very friendly, food is always awesome, and the place is cute. It's win win!"}
{"text":"Good food, casual joint! The servers are very nice and the owner is often around. The only reason I didn't five star is that there are other local places that I think have slightly better sushi however, this place is very good!!"}
{"text":"We live by MOTO so we are kinda stuck when it comes to sushi establishments. The sushi blows. You can tell it isn't fresh fish and never taste super. The Mojo & beers are the only good things. I don't really trust a sushi place that hides the sushi makers in the kitchen...stuff probably looks like week old shit which it is."}
{"text":"Very serviceable the few times I've been.   Won't blow you away but the food is good. The Las Vegas roll is delicious. Tootsie rolls are good too.   A bit pricey if you really get in a sushi mood. Atmosphere is good and service is generally good.   Decor is a bit weird especially if you get seated in the awkward area in the back near the rest rooms."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everything is so professional yet quirky and I love it. I could spend like 30 minutes reading the menu because of all the little hidden jokes on it... including their continuously updated plea never to touch their blinds (which, you totally should when they aren't looking, because they are made of cool beads!).   The sushi is all fresh and tasty and very cheap during happy hour (10% off everything, 50% off some rolls).   I am not saying you should mention the word underground to your server but I am not saying you shouldn't either, and if you do you may be rewarded with very delicious menu options..."}
{"text":"Walked in last night. The hostess refused to seat us at the round booth because when the restaurant closes, that's where the staff \"puts their stuff.\" Made no sense considering it was 8 pm and they closed at \"about 10.\" Were seated toward back. Only three other parties in restaurant area, a couple of people at bar. The server brought us food menus. We asked for drink menus. She seemed very bothered by us and said everything was already put away for the night......again, confirmed they closed at 10 since it was only 8....10 minutes passed by and she was behind the bar doing nothing at all the whole time, still no drink menus. So we decided to leave. Clearly we were not welcome. As we walked by her on our way out, she laughed. I repeat: LAUGHED at us as she sarcastically said \"sorry.\" I am not easily bothered by this sort of ignorance but considering how often I have been here, I was very offended as well as my two friends. We all have always come here but can say never again. I feel bad for the owner because I have seen him working there himself almost every time I have gone to eat. If he only knew the type of business he is losing due to staff. It's a shame."}
{"text":"This was by far my worst experience ever at a supposed sushi restaurant. I stopped by for lunch this afternoon and ordered some nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, tuna) and a few rolls (spicy yellowtail and Kalifornia [yes, they have a version spelled with a \"k\"]). Pretty standard fare and definitely nothing too exotic.   The yellowtail looked as if someone had intended to throw it away until I ordered it (then someone there must have decided, \"Why throw it away when we can serve it to this guy instead!\"). It was dry, rubbery, obviously spoiled and rancid. The spicy yellowtail was even worse. It might have been even older than the nigiri pieces they gave me since they tried to douse it in whatever awful spice-ridden concoction to mask the truly disgusting taste of the fish underneath.  I was truly offended that these people would even serve this and try to pass it off as edible food. I honestly should have notified the health department immediately.  Needless to say, avoid this place if you have any respect for yourself."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times I had a very positive experience. I have received good service, the price point is fine, and my menu selections have all been good. Is the greatest japanese food ever? No. But, hey, we're in Phoenix. If you want your world rocked, drive to San Diego. If you're looking for good food in the neighborhood and a nice, low key atmosphere, give it a shot."}
{"text":"As a sushi place, this is awful.  No salmon (only smoked), and the rest of the (small selection) of fish has always been fishy smelling and questionable quality.  I've been here 3 times and its mediocre at best.  Sake selection is small, 1 or 2 low end choices.  However, to give them credit, they do have a good beer lineup and their cooked japanese style food is very good.  Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour with half off rolls and the nachos are bomb. The beer selection is pathetic, but what do you expect from a sushi place. Just know your boy and girl signs for the bathroom so you don't make the same mistake my boyfriend did, think about Austin Powers. In all honesty, one of our favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! The most friendly place in Arizona without a doubt! Everyone is extremely nice and food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and HORRIBLE service! Our server took about ten minutes to get us water. We had to ask for a drink menu four times, and still never received it. Maybe our waitress felt awkward since she kept forgetting? The entire time we were there it felt like we were bothering her. I could understand if they were busy why the wait was so long, only thing is.....there were six tables in the whole restaurant! They had three servers working, as well as another women who maybe was a manager? Oh, and two people cleaning tables. I work in the food service industry and know what good service is, and this was far from it. When we finally got our sushi it wasn't anything special. I wish Moto was a thousand times better, since it is so close to home, but I guess now I know why I never really went back after the last time. I just can't believe even after asking four times we never got a drink menu. I'd think our waitress would want to make money and keep us happy. Maybe they treat customers with children like they don't matter. When we asked for a highchair the guy said he didn't know if they had any, and he wasn't a hostess!! I don't know how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Modern decor and great service.  Sunday happy hour brought us Asian nachos and a tootsie roll.  The Asian nachos were inventive and pretty darn good.  Tootsie roll was pretty standard, and missing the sauce.  Not amazing, but good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The wonton soup was pretty good. The broth and veggies were tasty. The noodle part of the wontons were also good. The meat was a little off.  The pad thai was also decent. A tad spicy for our taste. It was also a little pricey. But, the portion was large!  I would probably give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Why do I come here? Every time I do I promise myself it will be the last time. Went in got lunch today around 12:40. There were 6 tables including ours. It took over 5 minutes to get water on the table. We ordered a gyoza, a tootsie roll and a spicy tuna roll. It took an additional 30 mins for that to come out. Our waiter was rude and short with us, hardly came to the table at all. I didn't try the spicy tuna because I'm 9.5 months pregnant but my sister couldn't even choke it down because the fish tasted bad. We had to scarf our food down because my sister had to return to work. We didn't  anticipate it taking 40 minutes for two sushi rolls and some fried dumplings. It would have been one thing if it was busy, but it wasn't. And every time I come here the service gets worse. Seriously moto, this is the last time!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Suburbia.  Only you would have a sushi place with the chairs up on the tables at 9:40 on a Saturday Night.     I stopped by to check this place out after some christmas shopping errands, around 9:30 this Saturday.  Being a fan of sushi and craft beer, this was on my list to check out.   The waitress came by and handed me a list of beers on a folded piece of paper from her pocket.  I was really stoked with the selection.  I ordered a Dogfish Head 90min IPA.  The lovely waitress returned only to crush my hopes by saying that was an old list and that they didnt have any Dogfish Head on tap.  (Insert trombone failure sound effect here.  :::Waaahhh Wahhhhhh:::: ) Then she gave me a newer folded piece of paper with a slightly less appealing selection.  However, i found a tasty IPA and pulled the trigger.    I perused the menu... everything has \"Krab\" which must mean its artificial crab.  Most rolls also have something tempura.  This is classic tell-tale sign that they keep minimal fresh fish on hand.  Given that it is 9:30p on a saturday night and there is only one other table there, it's probably a good thing. This place doesn't get much traffic, so a lot of fish wouldn't sell fast enough.    I asked the waitress if these \"inside out rolls\" were their specialty rolls.  She said, nope, i have another secret list for that.  She slips me the folded paper list.  I'm starting to feel like i'm on a treasure hunt!  So exciting.  What other fun lists might she have up her sleeve?!  I ordered a Senorita roll because it is one of the only ones with fresh tuna on top of the roll.  The roll was large.  It wasn't cut with precision, some pieces were much larger than others, some smaller. (The place was empty, so it wasn't that the sushi chef was busy and rushed, he was just lazy.)  The Krab filling was Meh.  The tuna on top was tasty, but was certainly frozen, so it wasn't super.  Overall, the mediocrity of the roll was hidden by a lot of sweet eel sauce and some tempura crunchies.    As far as sushi places go, i'd give it a C. However, thanks to their good beer list and given that most suburban peeps wouldnt notice the difference between fresh never-frozen and frozen fish... As far as suburban restaurants go, id give it a B.  If you really like sushi, go somewhere else.  If you just want a good beer in the neighborhood and a passable roll to fill you up, then this place is perfect.  (I'll probably be back for that exact reason.)  If you've recently been on a date to Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  You will think this place is amazing.  Then again, you'll probably order a bud light too."}
{"text":"Regular customers.  Like the food but went in tonight while it was busy and got horrible service- from the owner no less!  It's on thing to be busy but to be blown off like we were was very disappointing.  We probably wont go back.  Definitely won't recommend."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened. I've made excuses for it many times because I enjoyed the convenient sushi it consistently provided. I never understood why a section of the bar always has a reserved sign just in case the owner showed up. But I kept coming even though I felt my kids were unwelcome (broken high chairs and menu instructions about keeping them from touching the blinds) because I wanted them to enjoy sushi instead of chicken nuggets. After the anniversary party I just can't take it anymore. What's with the Teen Mom wedding style zebra vases and Ikea style cafeteria tables that are so narrowly placed they scream awkward at the thought of squeezing through them?! Now an entire new serving staff dressed like a mechanics with a red handkerchief. I'm done."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, the food is good but service is slacking. 4 star food/atmosphere but 2 star service. They used to have 2 great bartenders but they've since moved on. The current staff is extremely unprofessional, including the kitchen staff. They are always having there own conversations while we sit and wait for someone to fill our drinks or take our order. I've watched our food sit in the window for several minutes with no one else willing to deliver our food while the bartender is busy(no teamwork at all). They get overwhelmed very easily and can't handle a crowd. I've overheard the owner talking about how he hates yelp which is just not something you want to hear. We will be back as it's in the neighborhood and the unlimited sushi is a great deal on Saturdays."}
{"text":"really nice staff...good beer selection...ok sushi"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  It was my first time eating Shashimi.  They served the tuna in the shape of a rose.  The friend I was with is an experienced sushi eater.  He thought it was very good.  Happy hour prices were good.  Half price rolls."}
{"text":"I love Moto.  I have eaten here at least 50 times.  I always get the Exit Wound Bowl.  It is easily my favorite dish at all the Phx establishments I have eaten.  I highly recommend Moto."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate Asian gastro pub and not a traditional sushi place. The beer menu is so outstanding I do not think there is a better one in the central corridor. The sushi is always delightful. The bowls are spicy and are a super value. The seaweed salad is super sized and very good. Miso is also good. I have never had a bad meal. The only negatives are the seating options for large groups, inconsistent and sometime sloppy wait staff and the dearth of parking."}
{"text":"I say use this place for cocktails.  We agreed, sitting at the corner of the bar that: 1. it was difficult to hear each other 2. the amount of krab mix on the menu was unfortunate 3. there was a noticeable lack of patio 4. we've had better service  There is an underground menu, but we only learned about that by overhearing the wait staff talking to other customers. They neglected the second half of our order, and finally we cancelled it and left.   Overall, I agree that this place seems like a great concept but falls down a little in its execution."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Sushi had way too much rice (some nearly inedible). Menu seemed to be obscure, just to be obscure.  Spring rolls were chock-full of 'filler'.  Not what we were expecting...with a $75 bill."}
{"text":"One of my girlfriends comes here a lot on Sunday's with her husband. So  when she and I decided to grab dinner I suggested her usual sushi joint. It was my first time and was pretty busy for a Saturday night. Service was quick and efficient and I like their variety of beers they had on tap. I got the Vegas roll, it was good but didn't have a lot of fish in it. More rice than anything. I will be back though, it's close and I like to support local business' in Phoenix. Next time I'll try more of a variety of what they offer."}
{"text":"You know you're in a sushi place when you walk in and it smells like a fish market... in a good way. Food was super fresh well prepared. The September roll was spicy crispy excellent. The veggie spring roll was plenty big as an appetizer, however that steamed vegetables were kind of bland. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I must confess, I didn't try to the sushi here, but I plan on going back another time to try it out.  But what I did try, the Curry Soup and the Potstickers were quite good.  I met a friend there for lunch, and it was quite busy, but we were able to snag a table without a wait.  There seemed to be some confusion as to who our waitress was, and we had like 3 different ones try to take our beverage order, but eventually they sorted it out.  The Curry Soup was divine!  Red curry, coconut, a bit of heat combined with the sweet crab and rice made this the perfect soup in my book!  The potstickers were nice and crispy, and the food came out pretty quickly.  My friend got a basic sushi roll (California) and said it was good too.  I do want to come back and try the sushi, especially the dessert sushi, which looked really yummy. The inside decor is modern, clean and comfortable, making for a nice dining atmosphere.  I would have given them 4 stars but they don't have a lunch menu, and it is kinda on the pricey side when considering lunch.  Most sushi places offer lunch bento boxes, but not Moto, and I really think they should jump on that bandwagon!"}
{"text":"Awful. Bar wings were inedible, the beef was inedible, the seared tuna was gray and disgusting, and the rolls were boring.  Sixty dollars later, and my daughter and I left most of the food on our plate. Server was indifferent."}
{"text":"Place is garbage, over priced, with lousy service.  Went there last nigh had a party of 5, Cyndi thought she needed to add 20% gratuity to our bill so she didn't have to really work for a tip. Just an awful place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have really enjoyed our weekly visits to Moto Sushi.  We love the location, and the vibe inside as well. All the sashimi and rolls have been wonderful.  Thank you!  Highly suggest visiting!"}
{"text":"We have been to Moto many times because the service and the food used to be great.  We went tonight for the first time in months (at my recommendation) and the service was HORRIBLE. We walked in, said we had reservations, they were empty - and sat us at a four top high table - fine!  Perfect.  After that - we sat for 15 min before we got a drink order, 15 more minutes before the drinks came along with the edamamee, and then we waited an additional hour and 15 min before we ever got our food of which we had to ask for on two occasions.  The female server kept apologizing but blaming it on the cooks and that they never saw the order she put in.  The wonton soup was cold, bland and not worth eating.  I also ordered the wok shrimp with sesame sauce but it was served with teriyaki and the shrimp was obviously pre-frozen, and hard.  Horrible.  I shared as much with her and not once did she say, I'm sorry, or let me take that off the bill.  I'm in the hospitality, resort F&B industry and have been for 30+ years and because we were with company (who shared my views) I remained silent to mgt."}
{"text":"I really don't like this place for sushi. The fish definitely comes from frozen and there's a lot of imitation crab meat being used.   On the other hand, the rice and noodle bowls are excellent. I'll definitely keep coming here but no more sushi.   Oh yeah, drinks are always good and there is a quality beer selection."}
{"text":"The sushi is always delicious, especially the ones listed on the underground menu (the volcano roll is to die for). We always go there for every special occasion. While it's true that the service is slow on Saturdays due to their all-you-can eat sushi special, I otherwise have no complaints."}
{"text":"This has been a nice little spot for our family over the years.  The Sushi is decent, good atmosphere, not too busy and great menu. But one thing we always forget is how bad the service is. If you're going to impress and take a large order from memory, you better get it right. Yet they never do! Advice, for parties of 4 or more, please do not try to remember everything by memory. The kind server forgot 4 Miso soups, 2 rolls, and our appetizer. Then as usual we waited 20 minutes for our bill to be brought while he fraternized behind the bar with his buddies. If the service is ever brought up to par, this could really be one of the better hidden gems in the area."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this place.  I was in a large group (which is usually never good).  We ordered some appetizers, which were pretty good.  Sweet potato fries (Japanese? I don't think so) and calamari (very small).  I ordered a sushi combo which had both sushi and sashimi for a very reasonable price.  The person next to me had one of their bowls.  It was delicious.  I kept asking if I could try it again (that is so rude), but it really was good.  Some kind of spicy chicken bowl. I also had a beer that was really good.  I don't remember the name, but it was delicious.   I will be back for sure, to check out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by Moto Sushi, this being said from some one that has ate an enormous amount of Great sushi in the Northwest ( Seattle, Vancouver, and San Fran). I was very skeptical at first, because it's dicey in Phoenix when it comes to getting good fresh Sushi. Ordered the eda mame and spring rolls for appetizers, both were great!! The plum sauce for the spring rolls was delicious. Ordered alaska roll and rainbow roll, and I was not disappointed at all. The place itself was very busy when we arrived, however the service was timely and on point. I would recommend this place to anyone that comes to Phoenix for sushi. Prices are not bad either, and by the looks of the Happy Hour menu very good prices to get your sushi on. I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here is THE best version of it I have had. The dishes are creative, beer is cold and the atmosphere is a positive buzz."}
{"text":"A friend took me to this restaurant because we were looking for Asian food on a Sunday evening, not too easy in Phoenix if you're not fond of chains.  We ate at the bar, had delicious crispy egg rolls, veggie bowl, I could just see families around us having wonderful food and especially enjoying the great friendly service, very relaxed but also fast and helpful in deciding what to order (I'm very conservative regarding spice and sushi)  Super clean, very affordable, all kinds of beer and wine.  Owner on the premises!  I will be going there often!"}
{"text":"This is truthfully the best sushi place in town! when your there dont forget to ask for the secret menu....."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's sushi and I love it. The Senorita roll is one of my favorites! Place isn't big and gets packed pretty quickly. You can't go wrong with any of their sushi selections there."}
{"text":"Lunch sushi combo was just about as good as any other sushi I have had in Phoenix.  The Yellowtail tasted fresh, and the spicy tuna roll was better than most places in town.  Our young, attractive waitress with a baby belly was great.  She recommended the Moto Wings in \"Mustard Gas\" sauce.  It was very good and not too spicy.  We looked at the beer list, and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of brews.  Happy hours looks enticing with $3 16 oz barley pops.  This place does feel a little like RA.  However, there is no RA bad food or RA \"I'm too attractive to really work\" waitstaff as far as I can tell.  I will be back for HH and to try other food on the big menu.  $25 for two at lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant in Phoenix. I was taken here for a lunch prior to an interview I had. I was pretty nervous about the whole situation so I don't remember too many details, but I would recommend this place if you're a sushi lover or on the go and need a quick lunch to eat at your desk. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Good sushi and nice sized plates for the price. Haven't tried drinks yet but its on the to-do list. Figure out the hidden menu before you go, if thats your kind of thing. I always feel weird ordering off of it, but it makes them smile. Go for happy hour and save some happy money for that pocket of yours! And if you're anything like me.. you will walk through the door and think \"HELLO MOTO!\""}
{"text":"We tried it again. It was worse. The place is dirty, the owner is sitting and leering in the corner, the simple sushi was incorrect and the chalk sign on the way out says \"Hate us on Yelp, because we care\".  Okay, I will hate you on Yelp...and in person, to your face and to everyone I know. I don't get it. Why even have a business if you don't care about your customers? I can only imagine how you treat your employees if this is how you treat your customers.  Good luck.  P.S. congratulations on the overtly racist banner out front. You managed to include sexism, racism and imperialism in one sentence."}
{"text":"Sashimi is always fresh. Love the beer selection which they seem to mix up often. Great happy hour pricing. Sports on the LCD tv's. I love this place. Off hours are best. Beat the rush and get great service. Check it out."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money."}
{"text":"i was looking forward to trying moto for quite some time. but upon arrival for an 8pm dinner we sat down to be very rushed. the sever was very rude. but once receiving 4 different sushi rolls i had to tune out the annoying staff rushing people out the door because it was delicious! i would have loved to stay and try more but the waitress said the kitchen was closed and reminded us once more they close at 9pm. awesome food and prices... not so friendly service and hours."}
{"text":"4 stars only because the only thing I dislike here is the bill. Food and service are always outstanding. When I get the Exit Wound for takeout, it is actually one of the most economical meals I can get. The Exit Wound is very spicy, but not so much that the other flavors get hidden in that, but the best thing about this meal are all of the different textures. It is a great experience to get this, but only if you can handle the heat."}
{"text":"Ordered two bowls of noodle with the wife.  An hour after walking in the door, we still didn't have noodles.    The waitress walked by 6 or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact.  Finally we had to leave to pick up our kids, not having eaten, not having had any sort of good service.  The waitress couldn't fathom why we would leave after having already been there about an hour.  I have eaten here before and it has decent food but I won't be wasting anymore of my time here.  The complete lack of an attempt at service or even acknowledging the lack of it is inexcusable in a service industry with so many options.  Hana has better Sushi/Japanese and is very near by on 7th ave."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  I'm not the first to say it.  I used to forgive many of my issues with this restaurant, mostly because they had a great happy hour.  I used to go about once a week.  They have since raised the price of happy hour sushi by $2, less appetizer and beer options are available.   The asian nachos seem alright for a minute, but they quickly become impossible to eat.  It's just not a good idea.  The sweet potato fries are weak.  A while back, I had a noodle dish and the vegetable Pho.  They were both overly sweetened.  After that, and the change to happy hour, I wasn't planning on going back.  I went back for the vegetable/tofu Pho, and because I asked about other vegan items they informed me the TOFU PHO now CONTAINS BEEF BROTH!!!  This is absurd.  I know beef broth is traditional, but this \"Fusion\" restaurant should at least try to have some dishes for vegans, and vegetarians for that matter.  Wow, i'm speechless.  The service is sub-par, and the menu is littered with snobby comments and jokes that belittle the customer.  All forgivable with a solid happy hour and a soup for vegans.  Bye Bye Moto."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley. Must try their all you order until the paramedic comes to revive you every Saturday from 11-2:30."}
{"text":"I come here when I have a group of friends, some want sushi and others don't like it. The pan-Asian menu satisfies everyone! It's a narrow space. I think it would be hard to seat more than 6 or 8 together.  I get the rice bows (4-step entrée), which are PLENTIFUL. I ordered the larger, plate-size. It was more than 2 meals for me.  All the sauces on the 4-step entrées are really good. I can't decide which one I like best.    The (all young, all female) servers wear tank-tops, and they all have the same look/aura. That worries me that the manager is hiring based on looks, not professionalism.    The sushi is good and comes out quickly. I have not tried their all-you-can-eat, but if you do, beware: there are lots of rules posted.    The owner's wry sense of humor pervades the place (menu, website, table tents....) Sometimes it works, sometimes it degrades the atmosphere.   I mentioned to the owner once that I thought someone made a mistake with my sauce. It was too hot for me to finish my dish.  I told him I thought he should check that batch of sauce. I had eaten it other times with no problems. He giggled and told me a wild story about his plans to add an \"exit-wound level of spiciness to the menu. So hot it burns twice!\"  I wished he had taken me seriously. BTW the \"exit-wound bowl\" is now on the menu.... see what I mean about his sense of humor?"}
{"text":"I love Moto. The food is great, love the music and casual atmosphere. They have a great happy hour! Their menu has so many things we like, but you should try the nachos, bar wings, and of course the sushi.  My daughter brought some friends here for her birthday, our server was fantastic! The staff is always friendly and attentive. In my experience, it has an inviting feel. It's our neighborhood place to go for sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi was wonderful. We tried 5 different choices. The cucumber salad was to die for. The Build Your Own Bowls were bland, both rice & noodle.  Service was only okay. She wasn't the friendliest and we had to wait for longer than normal each time we needed anything, ie. Wine, napkins."}
{"text":"I had to take my to-go order back 3 times because they got it wrong and the 3rd time, I took 5 bites of my salad before realizing there were crispy noodles in there that I SPECIFICALLY asked them not to put in because I have Celiac Disease and can't tolerate gluten.  Needless to say, I got very sick and am now home in bed instead of at work because of it. The girl at the take out counter, Tina, had the audacity to tell me it was my fault because she didn't hear me say it the second time I had to call back in because my order was wrong.  The 3rd time I went in after I realized I was going to get sick, I just asked for a refund.  The tall guy working was very nice and apologized over and over saying he would buy my meal next time but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I want to start out this review by saying - I am never going back to Moto.   I went there one time with a group. I was excited to try a new sushi place and normally really love sushi. However, there was a really bad odor when I walked in so I opted against trying the fish there out of fear of food poisoning. I can't comment on how the sushi is at Moto. Instead, I decided to try the Pho. I have eaten Pho at many places around town and typically enjoy it. Not at Moto. The broth was a darker color than I am used to and had a funny after taste. I couldn't even get through about 1/4 of it before I lost my appetite.   Most of the other members of my group didn't like the food much either. My advice is that there are too many other places near Moto for good sushi and pho to risk trying this place."}
{"text":"The Moto Chicken Salad is delicious.  The smaller size is huge and will happily fill you up for the rest of the day.  However, the best thing about this local neighborhood restaurant is a waitress named Jenny.  We always try to get her as our waitress.  She goes above and beyond to make sure that you have everything you need, and she is so upbeat and sweet that even if your day hasn't been going that well, you feel better!    I actually prefer to go during the week rather than on Saturday, but then I don't care about the all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"THE WORST...That's all I can say. Tried Spicy Tuna, Philly, chicken wings, chow mien. It was all really bad. Horrible."}
{"text":"Call ahead and make sure Vince - the owner - is there.  When he's not, the place totally falls apart.  It's like having a substitute teacher in a fourth grade class when Vince isn't there.  The servers don't care and get snooty and food comes out at various times.  I think this is a result of Vince being an active owner/manager.  The problem is that he doesn't have a solid manager to back him up when he's gone.  Someone else needs to be able to crack the whip.    I'm a regular and will continue to be so, but my trips to Moto are few and far between when Vince isn't there driving his tatted-up sushi and saki slinging serving staff."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch (around 2.30pm on black friday) which is a slow time. Only us and a few more people in the restaurant. We're big sushi fiends and the selection here was mediocre - through the quality of what they had was great. Desert mochi was scrumptious and the rolls.we tried instead of the sashimi variety were also great."}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers of Moto for years.  Unfortunately, the services is inconsistent.  Tonight, our sushi for 3 people took over an hour and 10 minutes to get.  After ordering, the waitress completely ignored us, until we started asking about our food after 50 minutes of waiting.  She kept telling us one more minute... for 20 minutes.  Before our food arrived, we asked for the bill to cancel our order.  She talked us into staying and we did because of our loyalty to this place.  Eventually the food came with a hair in the sushi that we tried to ignore.  After receiving and paying the full price for our food, we asked to speak to a manager.  We were told things were busy and that they hope they see us again.  So in summary it has good food if you're willing to wait forever in a moderately full restaurant to get served."}
{"text":"Not too many sushi choices in the area. Visited a month ago. Place was kinda busy, but our rolls came out pretty quick. Everything was fresh and overall service was good. I would give it another chance."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant all the time and love the lunch bowls, moto chicken salad and sushi.  Location is great, atmoshpere is okay recommend if you are in the area to check it out.  Sometimes there can be a short wait but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"So sad, this use to be our favorite place. We would eat there at least once a week for the last year. Charitys service never wavered, it was always top notch. The food quality has been so bad the last 3 weeks that this was our last trip there. Sincerely Mustered Gas wings and tofu pho couple."}
{"text":"Inventive.. Rice a bit on the over sticky side on the rolls but great service.  Must try the nachos and great happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Having not been to Moto in a couple of years, my girlfriend Karen an I recently made a return visit specifically for the all-you-can-eat sushi special. The first thing I noticed was that my favorite, eel nigiri, was replaced by smoked salmon on the all-you-can eat menu; strike one. Despite this, we both ordered the special. I opted for the additional sake bomber while Karen had a bottle of Sapporo. Now, the sushi was never spectacular in past visits, but the price was reasonable for the limited selection. But it was hard to reconcile the three dollar increase since our last visit;strike two. On a positive note the smoked salmon nigiri was actually VERY good. Unfortunately, that was the ONLY positive to this experience. The server was attentive enough though we felt rushed (we didn't reorder anything). When I got the check, I discovered that A)While I was only charged an additional three dollars for the sake bomber (22oz. Sapporo and a small sake), I was charged the full $5.00 for Karen's lone 22oz Sapporo. B)There was a 20% gratuity included in the bill.(I don't know if it was policy or the server was feeling especially generous with my money):strike three. I did not raise the issue with the check because we didn't really miss the two bucks though Karen might have liked to have had the sake also, And I would've tipped 20% anyway as is usually my practice when I receive adequate service though it is very presumptuous to automatically assume we received adequate service. Ultimately, there are too many other places where we can go to get adequate sushi and adequate service without being milked for an extra few bucks. Therefore we will not be returning to Moto as it is no longer in competition for our dining dollars."}
{"text":"great location and good service..food is good...but I am not a huge sushi lover so there you go"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for lunch.....   The likes:  The humorous menu and helpful staff.....  Nice portions, the Miso soup is excellent and large.  The edamame was adequate and fresh.  My lunchmate had the Vegas roll which was good but not the best in town by a long shot (think Hana and Dozo)  The dislikes:  I ordered the katsu...   This is a sticking point with me as few or no restaurants in the US seem to serve this properly.  The Katsu was goos but tasted like a generic chicken cutlet.  Panko should be VERY crispy and tasty this was not.  The appropriate accompniament is always white rise (check!) and shredded cabbage.  There seems to be the temptation to eliminate or modify this in the US.  Bad Idea!  While the \"Asian Slaw\" is tasty  it dominates the plate in a not so good way.  The Tea - Dammit! why do place have to serve such crappy tea!  It is an inexpensive way to complement a meal.  We got an ancient teabag with genmaicha in it served uncermonioously   The Service - Come her with lots of time the service was inattentive and sporadic.  When she was there it was great it was the 20 minute absence that killed the deal  I will go back for the AYCE buffet and try the sushi..."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was lousy. Started out with Edemame and Gyoza. Both were good. Had a mix of nigiri (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, and eel) plus some rolls. All were good.  Alas, food is only half the battle. The service was bad. The table next to us was left dirty for our entire meal. We started adding plates to the mess because our used plates were never picked up. Also, took about 20 minutes to get the check.   Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Food provided nourishment but the experience left something to be desired.    We had gone to this place for years because of business on this end of town.  The food was always good but the service was nothing to brag about.    We no longer come to this side of town, so never returned.  However, we found ourselves unexpectedly here and the service once again fell short.    I asked for no ranch on my dinner, it took three attempts to get it right.  Our server disappeared for at least 15 minutes while I sat with an empty beer and watched my wife eat her dinner.  My wife finished and I still had no plate.  At this point, I'm ready to leave.  I approached the hostess to find out what happened to our server.  Guess what, my food all of the sudden showed up.  I asked for the manager, our server said no problem.  The manager did not show up but our server came back offering 5% off the bill.  I just found it offensive.  Just acknowledge instead of pretending someone shouldn't be unhappy.  I go out to dinner for an experience, not annoyance.    It's been my experience that this restaurant is never packed, just every other table.  Just an average experience where you have to voice dissatisfaction if you have it because it's not presumed when it's a gross shortfall.  Most people hate complaining, why make them.  I wished I never said anything and just moved on.  McDonalds was just across the street.    It's not the first time an order has been screwed up, eat out enough it's gonna happen.  Generally not a big deal, crap happens, there's just better ways to handle it.  Like \"I'm sorry.\""}
{"text":"My first time here, my friend and I both got the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI which is Saturday 11-2:30pm. These are for rolls and nigiri, and there are rules - NO RICISM. Eat your rice. Anyway, the rolls were scrumptious, and the Las Vegas roll was a delicious departure from the norm. We started big, ordering 3 rolls each, then 3 more I think. Order what you can eat, OK? Don't be wasteful. You'll see the rules on the placard. *** $4 auto-tip added for all you can eat per person. ***   Another time I came here for my friend's b-day and the girlfriend treated several of us with URGING to consume. We all ordered a variety of rolls and we all shared many pieces of each. I felt guilty, but I couldn't get enough of the smoked salmon sashimi at $9.99 each. The presentation was beautiful - it was made to look like a rose on the plate.  The flavor and texture made me fall in love with each mouthful.  I had flashbacks of kissing Reanna, my old GF in the 90's. HHMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm.  *snaps awake* Oh and good beers too! Service was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place twice. The first time, it was super-awesome, and I love, love, love the divine desert sushi...hello?! Rice Krispy treats and ice cream? To die for. I started with the curry soup, quite good, with just a hint of spice. The sushi served was fresh and the portions (especially the sashimi) were quite large. My first experience at Moto? Overall excellent.  Sadly, on my second visit, I encountered a hot restaurant (eeew, raw fish and a hot environment?) with mediocre service. We arrived at 12:30 and attempted the All You Can Eat Sushi, two full hours later we had eaten exactly about two rolls and two nigiris each. minus soy sauce for the first order since we never got our soy sauce bowls. We were told the AYCES would take about 15 minutes to prepare when in actuality it took just under an hour for each order.   We watched as two different families sat at a table across from us and left after waiting for about 10 minutes to give a drink order, nobody ever came.    Finally, this little grandpa with his two grandsons came in they, like us waited and waited. the grandfather told the server he felt he had been waiting too long (45 minutes), she offered an apology and sent the manager over who began to actually argue with the man, she actually asked if he had ever eaten at a sushi place before.  Excuse me? Not professional.  Then tried to tell him that the server had placed his order only 20 minutes earlier. He was confused as he had ordered a good 40-45 minutes earlier.  The manager, again, argued with the man telling him he didn't order 45 minutes earlier.    Bottom line: AYCES is horrible, we actually overheard the manager tell the man \"The AYCES is prepared AFTER other regular orders, regardless of when placed, so that customers who order order off the regular menu get their food hot.\" Really? So the sushi chefs are also in the kitchen preparing soups and noodle dishes? Not likely.  So, take the 18 bucks, add on the automatic 20% gratuity and you've got yourself a meal a little over 20 bucks a piece and you've only eaten 5 pieces of sushi.    I will not return for AYCES, but for a dinner? Sure thing."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay but a little over priced.   Service isn't the best either.  They have had Fox News on every time I have been there, which no one under 60 years old wants to watch while eating.  Not great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local sushi places. They have a huge menu so even if you don't like sushi you'll probably find something else delicious to eat. The staff is very friendly. Get the dessert sushi!! It's so good!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to get sushi in the valley without breaking the bank. But wait, what if you don't want sushi? They have something for everyone. My friend says the burger is delicious, but me, I'm here for the underground sushi.   Pro tips: go during happy hour, 3 to 6:15 Monday through Friday and all day Sunday. Also sit at the bar, the bartenders are more attentive than the girls working the floor."}
{"text":"Yo! I found a new awesome hidden sushi place to Yelp about!!!!  Wait, three people have already Yelped it.   And apparently it's been open for 2 years already.   Never mind.  In any case, the first time I ever noticed Moto was some weeks ago as I stepped out of Basha's - a Basha's I never go to either since I almost always take AZ-51 home after work. But somehow that day I decided to take 16th St all the way down and Moto caught my eye, although I had no idea what it was still.   Fast forward to today, another day I decide to randomly drive down 16th St.  And I hit Glendale Ave.  As I wait at the light, I think. Now, I don't think too often, but for some reason today, I did. And I thought \"There's that Moto again. What's its deal?\"  And so I pulled into the Basha's lot, parked and walked up. A nice crossed out McDonald's golden arches symbol greets you as approach the door, which kicks ass considering McDonald's is in the same parking lot.   I knew I was going to like this place already, even though I still didn't know what the hell it was. \"Go Your Own Way\" by Fleetwood Mac was blaring from the speakers. Was this a biker bar? A car-themed burger joint?  Only one way to find out.  In I went, and a cool, contemporary restaurant layout was in front of me, with a bar full of good stuff beckoning. I decided today that I was going to sit at said bar, which was the best thing I could have done - I engaged in conversation with the server and the sushi chef the entire time and got the lowdown of the place.  Moto used to be a Shogun Express once upon a time, but the owner of the chain wanted to do something a notch higher and sold all the Shoguns and turned this location into Moto. The menu is eclectic and witty, offering a variety of rice bowls and sushi, along with buffalo burgers and \"sushi ice cream\" for dessert (a great concept called Mojos, where ice cream and brownie are rolled in a layer of rice krispies and then sliced like sushi and served in a bowl). They have a generous happy hour menu and All You Can Eat Saturdays from 11am-2:30pm.   I asked them how business was going and they said it's been really good, and it has become a local hangout full of regulars in north central Phoenix, which is awesome. I appreciate that this part of town has some great places like this and not just stuck with Panda Express (or even Shogun Express for that matter).   As for the food, I wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I just got unagi (eel) nigiri and an 8 piece spicy hamachi (yellowtail) roll. I'd say they were pretty well done, and although I thought Hana's sushi was better in the quality of the fish as well as presentation (he's not called Mr. Sushi Rock Star for nothing), for the price and also the taste I thought what I had here at Moto was still an awesome deal. I scored both orders plus a large Kirin Light (which came with a frosted 1.5 pint glass) for $12. Not bad. Not bad at all.  The fact that there was no pretentiousness at all here and that the servers and sushi chef were really friendly to a random confused guy dressed in his dorky office clothes, I give them high marks. Definitely another place to come back with friends (and also to partake in All You Can Eat Saturdays - you can bet your ass I'm there!).   4 stars."}
{"text":"Great place. Cheri, Marie, Nancy, Ivan, Fili, are all great people and provide top notch service. Love the food, eat there every Saturday. Give it a try you'll like it."}
{"text":"I've had better sushi elsewhere.  The service is what is worst.  When I've ordered, it's usually over lunch and I don't have time to dine in so I order ahead and pick up.  I've done this three times.  Don't ask me why, I guess I just like giving people lots of chances or something, unless they royally screw up the first time.  Each time I've gone in, I have to wait at the register and am completely ignored by EVERYONE who works there, even though they are standing right in front of me.  I'm not a picky or overbearing person who is prone to exagerration either.  I've waited tables before, I know you should at least greet someone and tell them you'll be right with them no matter how swamped you are.  Each time, they always forget the sauce that goes with one of the sushi rolls, and when I ask them (because I know they forgot), they act annoyed, check the bag- lo and behold, it's not there and they have to put it in.  Anyway, if the service were better I'd give it a better rating.  The sushi is just okay.  Maybe their other stuff is better.  The service bites.  Did I happen to mention the service could use some improvement?  ;)"}
{"text":"I find myself craving Moto and wishing I could go back for that Saturday All You Can Eat special. I live 15 minutes from the ocean now and haven't been impressed yet with any other business as far as service, price and quality goes. Together my friend and I ordered Tootsie Roll x2, Alaska Roll x2, Vegas roll and Veggie roll and all were VERY good.   Our waitress was very attentive and cheery, she even let us take home our leftovers (we over-ordered by an entire roll, didn't realize how stuffed we would get!) which is usually not allowed during AYCE, so thanks for that!  The initial wait time was about 20-25 minutes, but it was worth it and the orders after were very quick. I also want to note that they serve a delicious grapefruit-flavored beer called Pink Killer, which was very complimentary to our sushi rolls. When we asked where we may be able to find it outside of Moto, the waitress asked the manager who actually came out to our table to tell us about it. Very appreciated!"}
{"text":"The food as a whole is just average. The sushi is a bit below average. It falls in the \"not bad, but not good category\". I have not tried everything on the menu but one thing that is good is the Curry Soup. It is very spicy and has a great flavor. It is just not very filling, more or less soup with about a 1/2 cup of rice and a bit of crab meat. A bit pricey at $5.75. All the portions are very small and over priced. Come here for the drinks, to eat a bit, and hang out with friends but not if you are looking for great food."}
{"text":"$11 Vegas roll.. Krab, Smoked salmon, cream cheese and avocado.. First two pieces had nothing but rice.. There was a little sliver of avocado in the last two pieces.. As someone who has served sushi at a different restaurant, this is just laziness and under portioning by the sushi chefs.. Calamari was also undercooked, a mixture of soggy and rubbery."}
{"text":"I've been to Moto several times as it's right down the street from me, and it's my go-to when I want average sushi and a Happy Hour drink. The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine, but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries.   I use the term \"competently\" because it's by no means great food. The sushi is average, at best, but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant. This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu, but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment.   My one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating. I asked for a regular salmon roll once though, and was told that they only have the smoked salmon that comes in the Philly Roll. A sushi restaurant that doesn't carry raw salmon?! You've got to be kidding me, I hope that my server was just uninformed because that's pretty inexcusable otherwise.   I wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour, because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times."}
{"text":"I came here during happy hour for sushi. We ordered the calamari first, which was pretty good. It had a tasty dipping sauce with it. We ordered a rainbow roll and a las vegas roll. These two were quite unimpressive. There was little flavor and I was starting to doubt the quality of the fish.  Then I ordered the Sasquatch roll, which was really great. The flavors were delicious and I was quite impressed. However, this is the only roll that I would order again. Seems like the happy hour sushi is the cheap stuff. I would stick to the regular menu."}
{"text":"Moto is where I really got hooked on sushi, though what I have had off of the rest of the menu is always yummy too. The sushi is always fresh and the sweet potato fries are a great side to share with the table. I recommend Moto Happy Hour to friends all the time for sushi on a budget - the California, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Yellowtail rolls are all half-price and you can grab a 20oz beer for $3.50 to wash it all down. The \"underground menu\" is also a great option when your feeling flush - the rolls are all $12 each. My favorites are the volcano roll when I want something spicy and the mayflower roll when I want something bright and fresh. YUM!  My only complaint (besides the Fox news that is always on the television sets) is that they don't usually have the Ace Pear cider on tap like they used to... my non-beer drinking friends always appreciated the option and it was a favorite of mine as well.  UPDATE: the underground menu is above ground now - printed and pricey! The happy hour is still worthwhile and the beer list always has decent craft options (although they still lack a consistent cider for those who enjoy it and tend towards primarily hoppy beer choices). We still love the place and as we prepared to move cross-country, it was one of the few spots my husband needed to visit before saying goodbye for a year."}
{"text":"I have held off writing a review for Moto for a year or so.  Sadly I have been subject to dining here multiple times, because I am sucker for 'second chances...and third and fourth'...  Moto joined the North Central scene years ago, and sadly has gone down hill.  The only thing helping it stay afloat is the lack of other sushi restaurants in the area for the citizens of the neighborhood to enjoy.    The service is pitiful, and it seems like they hire anyone that inquires.  Dining at Moto takes over an hour and a half, with just 3 people.  Getting water upon arrival is painful and receiving the exact food you ordered, is not an option.   Whatever you do...don't come to dine if you have any food allergy.   The bartenders are always eating and licking their fingers, touching their hair and then touching everything \"sanitary\" behind the bar.  The drinks made and ready to go to their respectful customers, just sit at the bar back and begin to water down for easily 10 mins before the floor server magically reappears from the kitchen.  The food isnt even good!  Sushi is sloppy, not creative, and poor cuts of fish.    The ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI...well, they bank on their horrible service to never bring you the goods as you request and are ready.  We sat in front of empty plates for 35 mins at one point.  Twice now, when we were ready to leave, the server is no where to be found (just the same as most of the meal).  I was literally trying to give them money and they would avoid all eye contact and assistance. *que bad SNL skit from the 80s....   Please, do yourself a favor, and do not dine here....and WHATEVER you do...dont take anyone here for dinner, you will embarrass yourself."}
{"text":"I traveled to Phoenix regularly and every time I am in town, I make it a point to have dinner at Moto. They have a great selection of draft beers, their Pad Thai is one of the best I've ever had, but the standout menu item is the curry soup - it's the best!  If you're looking for a great Asian fusion meal with great service at a quaint restaurant, goto Moto!"}
{"text":"I liked the food! Ordered grilled salmon and a side salad. Both wear great! The ginger dressing on the salad was really good. I will come back."}
{"text":"man after reading some of the reviews I must of went on the greatest day of the year because everything was fantastic well I did not have sushi  i had a Asian qesadea it was good lots of chicken and a little spicy and the dipping sauce was really good the wings were breaded witch I didn't normally like but  these ones  I highly recommend  crispy and juicy  get there mustard gas sauce for the wings I just wanted to drink it hot and sweet  can't beat it  the Tonia salad was amazing so much chicken it had a lite breading  just right amount of acidity for the dressing but I add a little but of the mustard gas wing sauce to mine to spice it up man so good wife and the pho noodles that was good. it  wasn't  as good as mine our sever was grate went over the menu drinks got filled all the time didn't ever need to ask for anything and I find there signs funny people need to stop taking it personal I will be back very soon"}
{"text":"I love this place. Happy hour is 50% off selected items but those are delicious. Try the Asian Nachos."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye because of it's fun, trendy atmosphere vibe and the sassy menu (check it out online - you'll see what I mean) made me think this place was worth trying. What better time to try it then on a fun date night with the fiance?  Well, it's definitely got the fun, trendy atmosphere and yep, the menu is still amusingly sassy and clever. As for the food, well...the sushi is....decent. I believe another earlier yelper described it perfectly as \"passable.\" Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad in any way it just wasn't as good as other sushi I've had. My fiance and I ordered three rolls between the two of us and we felt that it was mostly rice, not enough fish and not enough flavor. The spicy tuna was just not spicy enough for me - not enough sriracha in my opinion - but that's just me. Overall, our stomachs left Moto Sushi satisfied from hunger but not overly excited about anything else.   Plus, I have to share that I had my most strange sushi restaurant experience while at Moto when the couple on a date at the table next to ours loudly proclaimed that they hate seafood and proceeded to order buffalo chicken wings - which they then ate with chopsticks - just baffled me.  It must be the combination of the sushi and the customers but I just didn't feel like I was in the right place for a great Japanese dinner. It almost felt like it was a restaurant that just happened to serve sushi but everything else about the place doesn't match. It just felt....off. It may be worth going back just to see what else is on their clever, sassy menu but only if we happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"*** Edited on April 13, 2008 to add this new bad experience. I'm thinking about changing my rating to ONE STAR because the experience.  Went to Moto at 9:35 PM on Sat April 13 April night. Sign states they close at 10 PM. Waitress and Host made us stand in doorway like dicks while they \"decide\" if they are still \"open.\"   They hem and haw and \"say hold on.\" I asked what time they stop seating and they said \"10:00 PM.\" I ask them what time it is. Instead of answering me directly, the waitress says \"fine, we'll seat you.\" We start to walk to the table and she adds \"but you have to order fast.\"  FUCK THAT!  So I tell her, \"thanks but no thank you\" and leave.  That was Saturday night.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start backwards, at the end of my experience. The dessert is fricking awesome! The rice crispy sushi roll ice cream thing is out of this world. Holy goodness it's yummy.  They also offer a nice selection of beer and the drink menu is diverse. The sake selection is not so great, but they do offer fun mixed drinks to make up for it.  As for the food - I would give it a B+. Maybe A-. The Asian nachos app. was actually pretty interesting (in a good way). The sushi was pretty good too. Not the best, but good.   Our server was a little strange. We couldn't decide if she was a little rude or just ditzy. But the host/door guy was great so at least we know they are capable of decent service.  Moto is a pretty solid place. I kind of wish it were downtown Phoenix rather than so far up north, but I guess a girl can't have everything she wants, right?  I'll be back to Moto soon, for sure. but the service needs much improvment."}
{"text":"The food is fresh - the lunch bowls are so customizable that nobody can really have an excuse to leave hungry or unhappy.    The service is prompt and unfussy, this place knows its business and its customers and does a great job of lunch.   The parking lot is gruesome, but that can't be helped on this corner. If I didn't have a 35 mile commute, this would be a happy hour goto for sure."}
{"text":"The pad Thai noodles is AMAZING!!! My boyfriend took me on a date here, and I was worried I wouldn't be able to find anything good to eat because I don't like sushi. Fortunately, they have Pad Thai noodles that tastes great! Also, they have great beer! Go go go!"}
{"text":"This is a great little Asian fusion joint! One side of the menu is primarily sushi the other fusion (Chinese, Vietnamese,  Thai ) The lemon grass pork was perfect balance of sweet, citus, and spice with nice cuts of pork. Sweet potato fries had just enough crunch and salt to make for a party in my mouth. Seaweed salad was generous and delightfully crunchy and not over sweet. They also happened to have a German NA beer I'd never seen before that was quite delicious.  They have plenty of alcohol,  but not being a drinker I couldn't tell you anything about it! One of my favorite parts of this place is the music...a great mix of rocking grooves from 60s-80s, but without being the repetitive \"greatest hits\" you hear over and over on classic rock stations...and kind of an old timey diner feel...on an end note, my niece is not an adventurous eater and she loves this place. When we were there last her food came with a garnish she's allergic to and they fixed it up without a fuss. After I asked about gf they were very consciousness about informing me of how various dishes were prepared. ***update : I went here a number of times while I was in phx and there was a steady decline from my initial awesome experience.  Food quality was pretty steady with the exception of some soggy, doused in sugar sweet potato fries. Service was very poor by the end...one time i didn't receive all of my change, one another continuously forgotten items throughout the meal, including bringing the appetizer at the end of the meal...when asked to take it off the tab since it was covered in the sauce we asked to not have since it was an allergen, they declined but brought us a freshly made one...I guess we can be grateful they didn't just scrape off the death-on-a-plate and bring it back."}
{"text":"You gotta try this place for sushi and ask for the underground menu!!  and save room for dessert, try their ice cream rolls!  My little picky sister who doesn't eat fish loves this place and she will actually eat sushi here.  Try the \"volcano roll\" its very tasty.  Their salads, rice and noodle bowls are awesome too."}
{"text":"Wow, pretty impressed. We tried to go to another restaurant in the area, but the wait was too long. I'm glad wifey remembered about this place. The parking lot is NUTS, but we lucked out and got a good spot. we were able to get seated immediately, which is ALWAYS a bonus! We started with the Asian Nachos $($7.95). There were good, but not my thing. I ordered the Sasquatch roll that had crab, shrimp tempura, scallop, avocado and this orange mayo, that was KILLER! ($12.95). Wifey got the Las Vegas Roll ($9.95) that had crab, cream cheese and shrimp and it was fried. Again, a great roll. I also ordered the spicy ribs. They were sauceless and SUPER crispy!!! I was expecting more grilled ribs (like my fave at Sochu House) but there were VERY good. And as a bonus, the server brought my wife and I a shot (I had both because she was driving) because she noticed my 5 year old kinda being a hand full and thought we could use it to unwind! How awesome is THAT? All in all, great food and super perfect service. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"love love moto fresh fish cool atmosphere must try this hip mod place.  The noodles are out of this world and the sushi is the best in this part of town. Be prepared for a long wait this place is popular."}
{"text":"Love this place great service great food and a lot of fun. It like my cheers bar. I will always dine at this place."}
{"text":"My family comes here at least twice a week. I moved out of town and they use to tell me when they were going out to dinner to make me jealous  I miss Moto so much. The service is awesome. The food is authentic. Every time I go to a sushi place I compare it and I never get the results I get at Moto. Honestly, beautiful service, people and food. Ask for charity. She gives best service, best drinks and genuine personality. It's obvious why she has been there for so long."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give Moto a try.  Overall I was pleased.  The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish, so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso.  The soup was a bit odd.  It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.  The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous.  When I need a sushi fix for lunch I'll be returning to Moto."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Phoenix sushi restaurant. I admit I mostly get the same items every time and out of the probably hundreds of times I've eaten here I've only had less than great food a couple times. They have vegetarian items too and most things can be ordered with tofu instead of chicken or beef ( the noodle bowls and Asian nachos). They also have an all you can eat sushi special on Saturdays I believe. Oh and you must try the mojos - they are a dessert item and to die for!  I order off the underground menu and it states that since they're specialty items it may take longer to make which is fine for me because I usually order to go anyway and the times I don't I order one of the craft beers on the constantly changing beer menu - I do love experimenting with the beers from different places.  There are a lot of regulars - smiling faces - and there are TVs playing the current games at the bar, very low key laid back vibe, I love it.  I will say it is much harder to get parking since Sprouts moved into the area but that's the only downside."}
{"text":"The menu here cracks me up, it has little comments on the decor, innuendos, recommendations / warnings (there is a stoner bowl and an exit wound bowl).  This is what fusion SHOULD be.  The smoked salmon sashimi is presented as a rose, their rainbow roll melts in your mouth. I love the spicy red curry coconut crab bisque. They have these Asian nachos, they're crispy wantons with all the stuff you'd expect on nachos. I drowned my sorrows from ending a ltr in these nachos, and those nachos worked."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have experienced very few challenges here. I have been going to moto for several years. The happy hour is AMAZING! When it's me and a friend, we walk out with a $15+tip bill and full bellies.. The food is great. I get the same thing almost every time I go in. The nachos are TO DIE FOR! I would also suggest the tootsie roll and gyoza (crispy). When I'm with my dad (and he is paying! :P) we order the Moto Chicken Salad-- so great! I eat here at least 2 times a month if not more. The waitresses are always friendly. Today we were in a hurry but really wanted happy hour sushi so they let us call our order in ahead (as you have to dine in for happy hour prices). We made it there in about 10 minutes and they had a table set up for us complete with waters and all of our food ready to eat! It absolutely made our day."}
{"text":"We love Moto! We are frequent visitors, and love the atmosphere as well as the sushi! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, sushi is great with a lot to offer on the menu. The waitresses are very friends and the service is always fantastic!"}
{"text":"I do have to agree with the other comments that the service is not the best.  I did not see any sobbing waitresses but it did take a while to get our food.  The fried calamari were very good, actually cooked perfect and not rubbery at all!  The Vegas roll did have crab in it which threw me off a little but was still good.  The tootsie rool was also very good!   Great Happy Hour prices..."}
{"text":"This is one of the top sushi places I have been to in the entire vally. The sushi chef even says he does private parties. Take a look at the catipillar roll picture I posted! Amazing..."}
{"text":"My go to spot for some great Asian inspired cuisine. Try the shrimp curry soup, the 4 step entree bowl, and get a craft beer and enjoy the unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about Moto Sushi outside of their sushi desert which consists of ice cream, nutella, and brownie rolled into a layer of rice krispies and sliced \"like sushi.\"  That might be the only thing sushi about it...because it's \"sliced like sushi.\"  If I sliced a crawfish into sushi roll shapes, would I be able to market it sliced \"like sushi\"?  It was a fun end of the meal treat.  Outside of that unique desert experience, their sushi was just so so.  The waitress had a \"secret menu\" that she did not even inform us until we had got our order.  My co worker then proceeded to order another roll after we found out about this secret menu.  I'm not sure what is the point of the secret menu if they don't show it to you until you after you receive your food.  What's the point?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi hangouts. Themed around motorcycle environment, Vince the owner has a great flare for combining Asian influences for delicious menu. Great appetizers, I suggest the Asian nachos. A must try is the desert, ice cream sushi. Different flavored each week it brings out the child in every adult."}
{"text":"So - started working right down the road from MOTO, and a coworker said, there's a good lunch spot down the road, we should go.  So we did.  I really, really like this place.  It's got a hip, yet laid back atmosphere, good rock music playing, and very genuine and friendly staff.    Food - I've had sushi here a few times, and it was \"good\".  About 7.5/10 on my sushi scale.  But let's talk about their build to order rice bowls.  You can mix and match a myriad of meats and vegetables and choose your temperature level.  I told my server a few visits ago that I really like hot, spicy food, and she recommended the \"Exit Wound\" bowl.  The name alone is super cool.  This selection immediately became my favorite lunch dish that I've had in ages.  Quite spicy, but not over the top....and amazing flavor sauteed into the breaded shrimp, chicken and fresh vegetables, all over white or brown rice.  (brown for me)  Did I mention that the owner of this place is a beer snob?  There are always several outstanding craft brews on tap here - and they go SO well with some of the spicier dishes.  I would come to MOTO just for the beer selections, but the food is also good enough to get me back in there as well.  I now visit Moto at least once a week for lunch, and they haven't let me down yet.  Love this joint - 5 stars - and get the Exit Wound bowl!!"}
{"text":"I've been in and out of this place for the last 2-3 years since I work so close to it and little has changed. Well,  everything except for the staff who may as well change every other week explaining a lot about the service or lack thereof.  Moto is run by both pretentious and puerile people who make the tragic mistake of thinking that they are either clever or fun. They are neither. Their menu is only half as ridiculous as their thinly veiled tantrums between employees about customers and co-workers. Well, depending on which menu you get, because a lot of their best puerile antics are in the phenomenally stupid act of hiding their food from their customers.   No joke, any one menu you see is incomplete because you have to get their \"secret\" menus to see what they really have. Often these same menus are woefully inaccurate anyway making any one menu pretty useless overall. You may as well cross your fingers when you order. My eyes rolled so hard they nearly popped out of my head when the staff explained this fun gimmick to me.  They burn through waiting staff like the place has a revolving door, so an all-too frequent sight is a woman sobbing her eyes out just outside the building because she got fired. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the boss will be out hollering at them making it even more attractive. Yeah, I want to eat THERE; where the women cry.  For the record, these guys bought a closed Japanese fast food restaurant (Formerly a Shogun Express), peeled off all the surfaces and then painted bricks red as they broke the lights making it incredibly dim to give it that east coast \"this place is condemned, but eat here anyway\" sort of look and feel.   You know what they say about eating in a low-lit environment, right? The prices are roughly on par with the vastly superior RA Sushi restaurant, but because they're both pretentious and puerile they will arbitrarily decide to tack on gratuity at a whim as well as various \"taxes\" to punish customers.   I'm not kidding. I observed a guy who got hit with a \"Geek Tax\" for bringing in his child holding a McDonald's cup, he was less than happy for the remarkle expense for a bowl of Chicken. I asked about it later and they explained that they fine people for various reasons and sneak it onto their bills.  It's not a great place to spend time, but since you'll be waiting FOREVER for food or drink refills anyway, you'll also come to embrace the ugly, uncomfortable furniture, which is meant to compel you to leave. So it's ironic that everything takes so long.  The food is schizophrenic in its spastic variety and its minuscule sushi portions and variety (and stupid list of in-restaurant rules) are pathetic. The management is barking mad, the servers can't juggle tables and the prices are as reliable as the unreliable menus.  If you MUST try this place, try to do the take-out service if possible. It's the only way not to be disappointed. Eat in at your own risk. I don't drink so I can't speak for their alcohol, but I hear their beer selection isn't bad."}
{"text":"We are generally big fans of Moto Sushi but today was not a good experience (unfortunately).  We waited for 40 minutes for take out food (2 Moto salads) and it was clear that there was a staffing/management issue.  The person at the desk never came out proactively to explain the delay and I had to go back up three times to get better attention to the order.  To make matters worse, the food was not good which is highly unusual but nevertheless very disappointing.  I assume the inferior quality of the outcome (food) was a result of trying to rush the meal preparation after alerting management 3X that I had been waiting for an unusually long time.  I hope this experience is an anomaly but for now, I will be gun shy to come back any time soon.  All the best!"}
{"text":"Been back a few more times, and I'm beginning to discover that when I don't order sushi at this sushi place, I enjoy my meal a lot more.  Wings, nachos and quesadilla are all unique dishes that work. Sushi is still OK, but I don't see us ordering rolls much in the future when they have such awesome dishes elsewhere on the menu.  I retract my previous comment about HH beers. I've noticed they heavily rotate their beer list for happy hour, which I love. A lot of the stuff on offer I have never heard of. Very strong beer list, check it out. Impressive.  Service is consistently very good, too. Definitely an all star team. Attentive and friendly every time, can't find that very often nowadays. Prices are reasonable, too.   Definitely in my regular rotation for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Fantastic find today! Great food, amazing beer on tap, and superb service. Sushi made to order and very helpful knowledgeable workers. Can't wait to come back for the hospitality and delicious food."}
{"text":"Love this local sushi spot. A must try in central Phoenix! They have a great selection on the menu! The fish is very fresh. You can spot me there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out fir friends! Friendly staff, creative food, and craft beers that I never heard of, but always willing to try.  The staff is knowledgable about the beer and the food and seem to care and take interest in their customers.  Stop in for happy hour, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I always use to eat there when I would get sick and tired of eating the junk at McDonald's (where I use to work at. At the time) and I moved to Las Vegas and always wonder if they stayed in business, I'm glad they still are because I love their rice bowls. They are good. I can't think of the name right now but ugh. It's so good. It burns your mouth but it's a good burn. I hope this place stays open decades and decades to come."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. Most times the entrees are on point! Only when it's super busy that a mistake could happen...we're all human. Awesome beers on tap! Love the banner and I'm Asian for saying this...just lighten the fuck up people! He's married to a wonder, strong, successful asian lady!"}
{"text":"The cool kids in the office like Moto, I want to like Moto.  Lots of Yelp'ers don't like Moto... Oh, that's what those bad reviews were talking about...  Great ideas and recipes with inconsistent execution.  They burned my wings. Look at the picture (if you can).  I thought it was sauce... nope.  They are overcooked.  I am clumsy so I always ask for extra napkins...when I can.  After I completely use my own waiting for a chance to ask, I lean over and take some off the neighboring table.  To be fair there were some cool people there, so I guess my waitress had better things to do.    This place could be five stars if they fix the service and cooking (That sounded like a complement in my head).  What I mean to say is Moto has a good vibe and a great menu.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"This sushi place has been a favorite for sometime. They are decent with  prices and ambiance. The food is good, one of the best squid salads in town!. There happy hour sushi menu has a few regular pieces, like california role; i think i would like to see more of a selection in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up during my lunch hour and they said ready in 30 min. I arrived 30 min later at and had to wait until 11:55!  They could have at least offered me a drink of water after I wasted my lunch waiting. All to receive a tiny peace of salmon in my very dissapointing salmon bowl ."}
{"text":"I SENT THE FOLLOWING TO THE MANAGEMENT AT MOTO ON JULY 17.  Good morning:  People I work with had raved about MOTO, and since I had moved to the downtown area, were eager to show it to me, although each had admitted to not having been there in a while. I was excited to find a decent sushi joint as I now live 3 minutes away and appreciated an introduction to someplace where I would thereafter go on my own to enjoy the sushi bar after work as my local.   I visited on July 5th and met one of my friends who had been seated at the tiniest two-top around the corner from the service area in the seated dining area which had only 2 other occupants. I asked to move to a window table in preparation for the  sushi all you can eat experience.  She ordered two of the rolls and I had 3 of the nigiri  on offer. The rice was so loose I couldn't pick it up even with fingers without everything scattering.  For someplace that madates YOU MUST EAT THE RICE, the chef didn't make that easy. I would have expected nominal seasoning with the vinegar in the rice or a small bit of wasabi between fish and rice but this didn't have any, which may be MOTO syle,  but with the rice being so loose, I couldn't easily put a bit of wasabi between fish and rice, it made eating in the style I wanted difficult. The fish was fresh and good, but the prep was sloppy. I did order the other 3 nigiri and again: fish fresh, prep sloppy.    My friend had the rolls which were 6 or 8 cut but she left 4 pieces of each. I tried one piece and the thing was so sweet I couldn't taste any of the other ingredients.  She didn't want to order any more, and that kind of killed my experience so I couldn't eat any more whilst she just sat there.    Another couple came in and was seated at our former table and they were complaining that the prices had increased and I believe they ended up ordering a la carte, but were complaining to each other about the amount of dressing on their rolls and that the quality had gone down.    When our server came to see if we wanted anything else, we declined and I asked for a box for her unwanted rolls. I was advised that wasn't possible unless I wanted to pay full price for them.  They were inedible and I have a local homeless person I was going to drop them with as I wouldn't eat them. I understand the policy is to prevent piggy people who order 500 things and want to take most home to eat for the week but this was unwarranted because the quality was bad so the result was - the restaurant would rather throw it out, than allow the unsatisfied patron a compromise.   My dining partner asked if she could just pay for the price of the two rolls that were to be thrown away as it was less expensive than the all you can eat price, and she certainly didn't get her money's worth. She was told no. Then we received our bill with an automatically added 20% gratuity on the whole bill. For a two top. On a Saturday afternoon. In an empty restaurant.  I understand it for larger parties, especially with the all you can eat when the service warrants it. I had one beer, she had one Coke product, and I got a water side, no refills.  Very little attention was required, and most of the staff was stading behind the bar in service just chatting....the sushi chef was active, serving the few patrons at the bar...maybe 5? The restaurant never got full, during our time there, only one table of two moms with babies and another table of two men were there.    I came away unhappy with your business practice. I understand where it may be hard to enforce discretion with the auto 20% (which is what I tip on basic service, my friend says she tips 15% for decent/good service at lunch).  But we required very little attention, she certainly didn't get her money's worth and that killed my ability to enjoy the good fish at least.  Not being able to even give away the rest of the rolls really got up my nose knowing the food would be wasted and we certainly weren't taking advantage. The server was new, but pleasant and a decent worker. The food prep sloppy and it was very unsatisfying.    I want to give MOTO management the opportunity to respond.  People wanted me to put a review on Yelp but I believe people in food service genuinel want to provide a good experience where the customer comes away happy.  I post positive reviews on other sites - a reward for good work, so I am taking the time to contact you directly as I was sorely disappointed.    Thank you for your consideration, and a reply would be appreciated.   +++ They never answered me. Don't waste your money on a subpar restaurant. I would have happily spent  the 30+ dollars for my meal on a quality lunch at Hana or Sushi Ko, with excellent service and management that seems to care a little bit.  I give one star because the fish was fresh and our server was good, she just doesn't stand a chance to be rewarded at this place. Sad."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on Saturday for the All-you can eat sushi.  It wasn't very crowed which is to say they had available seats at the bar and tables empty.  I sat at the sushi bar and waited 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged me.  The sushi chef asked if I had been helped.  I said no.  He said someone will be right with me.  5 min later I finally get a drink.  I stopped the guy and told him to just take my order and that I wanted the all you can eat special.  The chef was busy the whole time making orders so this isn't his fault but I got my food about 15 min after ordering.  My second order took almost 20 min.   Its hard to justify an all you can eat deal when it takes so long to get food.  They really need a second chef to help with the sushi.  They weren't attentive and it was really a sub par experience at best."}
{"text":"The food here was good.  I got the Vegas roll, which was delicious except the pieces were HUGE.  I had to eat each piece in two bites, with my hands, so I wasn't too happy about that. I prefer to eat sushi with chopsticks to avoid the mess.  At first I attempted to order the sushi combo.  I wanted to substitute the spicy tuna roll for something else (even another 1/2 Kalifornia roll that already comes with it), but they wouldn't let me.  That was a big let down.  Other than that, my fiance ordered the pad thai, which he liked, but it wasn't the best ever.  The best thing about Moto was the sushi ice cream, called mojos.  They are delicious!  A small order came with 6 pieces, I think, and that was too much for us.  It was a good deal for the money. I would highly suggest ordering it if you have room in your tummy (which is why I only ordered the Vegas roll).  The patrons seemed to be mostly in their 20s and 30s.  I think that's a good sign.  I'm giving Moto three stars because of their lack of substitution options and their high prices for sushi.  Their rice bowls seem like a good deal, though."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix for Easter weekend, the boyfriend and I decided to venture out and try some sushi.  I checked out yelp for suggestions, and after looking over Moto's website and snarky menu, we jumped in the car and drove over.   We were seated right away, and both decided to try the all you can eat.  I did the regular all you can eat deal, and Travis did the one w/ the Sapporo and sake.  I felt that for the price, it was a great deal. Especially coming from LA sushi prices which can be outrageous.   Travis did not read the rules and had to pay 50 cents for each piece he did not eat, which was a bummer, but I feel, it was put in the rules of the All You Can Eat deal so what are you gonna do?   The service was a bit slow, but it was clean, and the waitstaff was friendly.  I would probably go back if I wanted sushi again in Phoenix.   Their non-sushi menu looked tasty as well, so maybe next time ;)"}
{"text":"I have now had the opportunity to visit Moto 5 times, and have never been disappointed. From their traditional renditions of sushi and sashimi, to their masterful unique creations, you will find a favorite, but will love exploring everything on the menu. Be sure to save some room for their Ice Cream sushi rolls (Mojo's), its like heaven in a roll. Great atmosphere, excellent customer service and just an all around perfect place to go when the mood for Sushi hits you! Enjoy"}
{"text":"While I'm against any kind of all you can eat type places I have been to Moto a couple of times with my cousin who lived near by.  For around 22 bucks you get a sake bomb and all you can eat rolls and nigiri of a preselected group.  You can chose from around 9 or so basic rolls and half a dozen choices of nigiri.  It really was half decent.  The staff was a bit rude but the rolls were good enough to have a few.  If you are looking for knock out sushi and the whole authentic Japanese experience I would not recommend coming here.  But if you are looking for a decent deal and to have a drink and good enough sushi this is the place."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night. It was my second time having Sushi in AZ since I moved from NY. I was scared that I wouldn't like sushi in AZ but I thoroughly enjoyed my food here. I had a combo that included yellow tail, salmon sashimi, and spicy tuna.  I had a Kirin beer.  The food,  service and atmosphere were all great. I came here a second time for Sunday brunch and tried their fried chicken and vegetable fried rice- both very, very good.    My only complaint would be the smart ass blurbs on the menu- they are quite condescending.  I feel like somebody in this place thinks they are cooler than everyone else which would be fine if they also showed appreciation for faithful patronage on their \"witty\" menu."}
{"text":"I love MOTO. I Crave their Curry Soup. It is amazing. And their Moto Chicken Salad has been a favorite of mine since back in their Shogun Express days. I am so glad I found it again. I've taken out the large and it fed my daughter and I for 2 days. I try to hit MOTO whenever I am even close to that part of town!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, love it! Happy hour is the bomb! Definitely recommend the Asian nachos and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch today... it has been a couple of years since my last visit, but everything seemed pretty much the same.  We had the fish tacos (panko-breaded salmon) and a shrimp tempura roll.  The tacos were pretty yummy, although I thought the \"guac\" was rather interesting - they must use green peas to make the (expensive) avocado go further.  It wasn't bad... just different.  We added the sweet potato fries for just an extra buck... good call! They were deliciously crispy, sweet, and salty. Mmm.  The tempura roll was a little underwhelming.  First off, it was approximately 2 inches in diameter.  Now, I'm not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but I couldn't fit an entire piece in my mouth... and it is WAY to hard to eat half a piece, you know?  They used carrot in the roll... which wouldn't have been a problem, except for it was large chunks of carrot (the size of half a baby carrot).  It was really distracting from the texture I expect in a tempura roll... they should just call it a Carrot Roll, since that is all you notice with that big ol' crunch!   All-in-all, it was a pleasant lunch with pleasant service.  A few tweaks to the food would help bump it up in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour, friendly staff, the food was pretty great. the owner was taking the time to make sure everything was good, his name was Vince awesome place will go again soon"}
{"text":"Moto is so good! I feel fortunate to live so close to a place this good.   All the sushi is great - the best I've had in Phx other than RA.  There's also a huge selection of beers and a big menu aside from sushi for non raw fish eaters (there's always one)."}
{"text":"Delicious! This is my FAVORITE spot in the valley... Not really a sushi eater, but their Las Vegas Roll is off the charts! Some other favorites include the Moto Chicken Salad, the Asian Nachos, the Yakisoba and the Quesadilla! Would eat here everyday if I could!  PS - Try their iced green tea! So good!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.... Love going here and the owner is fantastic.  The staff is always friendly and remembers who we are.  Their Moto Chicken Salad is awesome and so are the rice bowls."}
{"text":"I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place.   I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she \"needs a minute to move the table\" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit.   Star removal #1.  We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?  Star removal #2.  We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow.   Star removal #3.  They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.  Star Removal #4  I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that \"We can grat anyone we want\" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.  Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.  P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours.   FAIL."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Food is actually decent but their lack or care and absolute disregard for the customer is unacceptable. If you wait too long for your food or to be seated they do not care nor do they apologize. If you request a substitution due to allergies etc they refuse to accommodate any requests. Even if you are willing to pay an upcharge. Additionally, their overall attitude both in person and on their website and on their menu blurbs is so sarcastic and nasty that it is blatantly rude. I cannot in good faith ever recommend this restaurant knowing how little they care about their customers and their dining experience."}
{"text":"Good sushi. I have food allergies and the waitress helped me select all sorts of dishes.   The place is small but cute and clean. I'd go back since its right near my office."}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean  . Server was prompt . We tried the tuna roll and California  roll the rice was cold and dry . We also ordered  orange chicken  and teriyaki   beef. Both were very sweet.maybe a little  over cooked."}
{"text":"I got the exit wound. Bowl was ok. Ok as in edible. The chicken was really dry but the sauce was tasty. The peppers were way overcooked and mushy. This place just likes to overcook everything... But that's not why this place sucks. The service i got here was just terrible. Nobody greeted me even tho three workers were clearly present behind the bar. I ordered to go and they made me wait five mins before even acknowledging me. I was actually having to debate waving them down! Eventually the girl came to greet me at the register. She was unable to do two things at once and gave an ice tea cup priority over me after making we wait for her attention. She counted my change wrong and I had to ask for the extra dollar she forgot about. At least she didn't question her mistake. This place seems like it has potential in the food and I would come back if they would stop over cooking everything. But the service is unacceptable and needs work. For this reason, if I ever came back here I would give extra time for my order and come in expecting to count my change and be forced to wait for a to go order that was already sitting at the counter ready to go."}
{"text":"Moto is an all time favorite and will drive out of my way just to pop in. Have brought several friends here including my wife and they keep coming back not only because of the food and epic beer list but the service is great, ask for Charity, and staff attentive. Best Vietnamese pork ever."}
{"text":"I just had the best brussels sprouts in the city seriously everyone should  be coming here and try them."}
{"text":"Third time there was not a charm. Sushi rolls were dry and I was starving.  We got the beef bowl and the meet was salty and dry. Service  was also slow. I should  have ordered  the  crispy chicken . Place was busy but the food was unacceptable.  I will  skip going there"}
{"text":"We usually go here for their Sunday happy hour. The sushi is good and I've had their bbq pork noodles which have a lot of flavor, but for the most part it's not very authentic. Something different was their sushi ice cream, that was pretty awesome, you cant really go wrong with rice crispy treats and ice cream! The service has been very hit or miss."}
{"text":"Sushi was average & choices extremely limited. Drinks watered down. Atmosphere and decor are tops"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm updating my review. I come here far too often not to bump it up another notch. Plus, now I don't have to worry about someone calling me out when I stop by for my favorite chicken salad. Honestly, this is probably the best bang for your buck HH around. Who doesn't appreciate cheap and delicious food? Obviously, past Morgan didn't."}
{"text":"It was mediocre at best and I'm one that can find enjoyment in a lot of things in life. The service was good, our waitress was attentive. I would give you her name but unfortunately she didn't give it to us and I'm one of those people who always remember our servers names. She is a part of the reason why this even got another star. I saw another server completely ignore her table and they got upset so I guess it depends on who you get here.  I feel like this is a hipster joint. The food wasn't that flavorful. It wasn't horrible. I would take a small hole in the wall sushi place with good sushi and better atmosphere.  My OCD part of the review: The decor was almost there besides the hideous zebra vase. I know that this part of the review is obsessive but look at the picture! Haha I couldn't stop looking at it during dinner."}
{"text":"Wouldn't seat me at a table because I was by myself... waited 5 minutes without having my drink order taken at the bar... left..."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and while the food is merely decent, the happy hour is good. However, I ate here yesterday and experienced the worst customer service. When it came time to pay my bill the waitress told me their system was down and they couldn't take my card. Half and hour later nothing had changed. I was forced to walk to an ATM and  take cash out. When I returned I figured I'd receive a discount after waiting for so long, but that was not the case. Not only did they not want to give me any discount, but when the manager came over I was told $3 was all she could do. I don't understand why she thought that was okay for a $40 bill.   I will never return and I will never recommend. By far the worst customer service I've received."}
{"text":"Don't order sushi here. It's expensive and taste like holes. The wonton nacho is good but eat it fast because it gets soggy very fast, like too fast. I like the wings but too little for what they charge. Don't order pho either unless you never had Vietnamese noodles before then it probably tastes ok. But to everyone else that has, don't do it. If you've read that the sushi is good by others, they are probably friends of the owner or something because, really? 5 stars for this sushi is crazy talk. Service is good and some of the other apps are good. Katsu chicken is good I order it with slaw and brown rice."}
{"text":"This is a local hotspot.  I've been going here for years and the employees say hello to you when you walk in.  Happy hour sushi M-F 3-6:15, all you can eat sushi on Saturday from 11-2:30, happy again on Sundays until 6pm I believe.  Different micro brews all of the time-always fun to taste :)  Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Love Moto's salads, and their sushi is good as well.  Also can't count the number of time I have called in for a chicken teriyaki to go, and had a great on the go dinner."}
{"text":"If  you're looking for a casual, unpretentious sushi bar then go to Moto Sushi. The ambiance is like Starbucks (mood lighting) but with sushi. Vince is the Owner and has a great knack of remembering your name, which gives it a 'mom and pop' feel. I love the marketing of this place from the menus to the picture on the wall (hot asian model named Jayd Lovely by the hostess stand-shamless plug, don't hate). The food portions are perfect and this is truly important to me because I've yet to meet anyone who can out-eat me. I love their custom chicken/rice bowls, sushi is always fresh, and the moto chicken wings are spicy and moist. End your meal with an order of mojos or two (I don't like to typically share my dessert unless I'm in love with you) which is dee-licious!  Oh! And ask for their underground sushi menu to spice things up a bit."}
{"text":"Vince the owner is fantastic and always here to ensure great service. (As is his fiancé Janet) great people. Support local business!"}
{"text":"Ordered two basic and simple rolls and received sushi that looked rolled by a child.  Sloppy presentation and rice was super tacky to the point of staleness.  Decided not to buy any more rolls since they failed the first two tester rolls.  If you cannot make a spicy tuna roll you have no business calling yourself a sushi place.  Pad Thai sounded yummy and ordered chicken added to the dish.  We were going to forgive the rolls since we can be a little snooty about sushi, but shouldn't you be?  Its not like you ordered anything cheap.  After two bites into the Pad Thai I bit into a bone! Mmm...wasnt expecting that!  I spit out the bone and looked through the Pad Thai to find three bone shards in the noodles.  Wanting to bring it to the attention of the management, cause I would want to know if it were my place if bone fragements were being served by accident to my patrons, we waited 15 mins to be told that they would make us another dish.  Aftering waiting for so long, the appetite for this place was gone and we asked if they could just remove the item from the bill.  The manager said,\"Of course, sorry.\"  No big deal until we got the bill and only the additional charge for chicken was removed from the bill.  Asking to speak to the manager again since we were told the entree was going to be removed we were told, \"I took the chicken off since that is what you had a problem with and everyone know that is the risk you take when eating chicken, cuz chicken's have bones.\" WHAT?! I was dumbfounded, not only bad food, bad service from management (server was great!) but we were actually insulted!  Wow, interesting business ethics.  No mo Moto fo sho!"}
{"text":"The service is always great.  Everyone is friendly.  The food is amazing.  I love the spicy tuna roll and california roll.  My husband had the chow mein with beef, which I tasted and I started eating that too.  I couldn't get enough of any of it.  They have indoor and outdoor seating and they offer take-out.  I know a lot of people speak highly of the sushi restaurants in Old Town, but if you just don't want to go all that way, definitely go to Moto.  You'll love it.  And for those Spicy food lovers, Moto offers all levels of spice.  Just be careful what you ask for.  If you know what I mean.  The name of the menu item will say it all."}
{"text":"I woke up wanting both Mexican and sushi, so what's a girl to do but go to Moto! I remembered their Asian nachos and before stepping foot out of bed visions of them were dancing in my head! I was kind of worried bc I know saturdays they have the all u can eat sushi thing and I've heard it gets packed and service is slow, but the nachos on my brain were too hard to ignore so we pressed on!  It was near-full, but we were seated and had a small chicken nachos in no time! So flippin good I can't even tell you! The sauce is like half BBQ half hot sauce, and it's fantastic! We got an extra side of that and of sriracha (bc sauce, to me, is a must-have).  We decided to go with the a.y.c.e. deal, and I ordered 4 rolls and 2 kinds of nigiri. Our server then turned to my companion and asked what he would like?!?!?!? Huh? I'm not a competitive eater! I had ordered for both of us. She got all bristly, and I told her we knew that each person pays 18.95 for ayce, and we were cool with that, but just ordering together. It was a big deal that needn't be, but whatev's.   I'm not a fan of smoked salmon, but the Vegas roll was still good. Fry anything and it works. The tootsie was our favorite and the spicy yellowtail our least. We couldn't finish our order and didn't order anything else. Our server said she felt bad for charging us both the ayce price when we only ordered one plate, but she had no problem doing it. They must have a lot of losers coming in trying to feed the whole fam at one price I guess. Not so cool for us normal people. I will be back for those damn nachos, but probably won't ever do the ayce again. If you can pack it away-go for it, if not-just stick with what you like and avoid the drama."}
{"text":"An absolute travesty if you're here for sushi. An AYCE sushi menu limited to Krab (yes with a K ), smoked salmon, tuna, unagi, yellowtail, and rolls that look like they're made by Sushi-bot 5000 that shoots Krab as excrement. The fish themselves are atrocious and taste like they've had better days. The Krab seems to be some kind of binding agent they try to hide in every space imaginable just to fill you up. The sushi rice is the only thing that was prepared correctly and it was a blessing in disguise for it to be served by bushels in each bite. The service is borderline senile and their \"AYCE rules\" are written very condescendingly. As we were near finished, a friend had asked if I got my moneys worth. My response...  \"yes, by not ordering anymore.\""}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one day and wasn't pleased with the experience. The rolls were warm and fell apart. The service was fair at best and the place wasn't even very busy. Not that Phoenix is known for it's Sushi, but you'd expect better from a place like this. All that said, the menu is a hoot and worth a read, just don't order anything from it."}
{"text":"one of my go-to spots when I go to town. pretty much everything is very good. Yaki soba tasty but dry."}
{"text":"The sushi is good here, but my favorite dish is the spicy shrimp and chicken bowl (with noodles).  I've been here over and over for this dish.  The hottest sauce you can get with it is the real deal!  It's so hot it will make your mouth numb.  The owner is always around to make sure the place is running smoothly.  The bartenders are friendly and helpful.  I've never seen anyone unhappy with a meal here so give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I like it. The service was quick, delightful and considerate. They were busy for lunch and it took a while to get our rolls. The food was tasty and just enough to fill our tummies."}
{"text":"We got take out from here during a spring break trip. Noodles, sushi, edamame, popcorn shrimp. All delicious. I ate the leftover noodles, cold, for breakfast, the next morning."}
{"text":"In town for a week for work and had heard good things about this place so decided to go for dinner with my coworkers. Below is a review off the dishes we had  Pad Thai- the portions were huge. The spirit peanut was amazing and overall it met the expectation for decent pad Thai  Spring Rolls- these were very small compared to traditional spring rolls. They didn't seem to be fresh, the rice paper was a bit tough.   - classified bowl- this bowl is no joke! If out like spicy this is defiantly for you! You will sweat and cry but over all the dish is really good.   The portions on the main dishes are pretty big. It was average joint. Nothing to get super excited about but it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have had better experiences in the past, but yesterday just wasn't good. They weren't busy- but the food (even appetizers ) took a long time to come out. And it was cold. The food was not tasty at all.. half cold, over-seasoned, and just a weird mash up of flavors. The waitress barely heckled on us the whole time we were there...  not sure if will come back"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here the other night after a birthday party. We ordered the coconut curry soup, sashimi, and each had a dinner.  The food was tasty and filling. We haven't had that much food for that low of a price in a long time. I don't think anywhere else serves such generous portions of sashimi, and definitely not at that price.  We will definitely make this a regular place to visit."}
{"text":"strictly going for the sushi is a no-no, however they have much more to offer.  they have about the best happy hour you can can find in town, cheap rolls, aps and beers.  i also am a fan of the dumplings and seaweed soup.  None of that holds a saki bomb to the dessert.  Now don't get me wrong i don't really like desert often, but when someone comes up with an idea of a \"sushi roll\" dessert that contains, nuget, ice cream, rice crispy treats, chocolate sauce i am interested.  when they serve it in a bowl cut like sushi and looking like sushi i am SOLD!  do yourself a favor go to happy hour and get the dessert role."}
{"text":"If you're looking for original, authentic, and fresh food -- this isn't the place. The concept is fun and whimsical like a Japanese girl taking pictures and making a peace sign, but it's all make-up no substance. The rolls are weak and I would not recommend the yakisoba.   If you're a typical Phoenician, this is a great starter place for the non-adventurous types that fein at being adventurous. There is nothing weird on the menu and almost all of it tastes like chicken!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything I didn't love at Moto! Sushi, bowls, burger, calamari - all yummy! One of my favorites in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Arggggh! This place had so much potential: great beer list, solid design and decor, and not too far from our house.  Unfortunately, they don't have great sushi. They don't even have good enough sushi to bring me back despite the beer list. The search for decent, reasonably priced sushi continues..."}
{"text":"I had some pretty good sushi at this place last week.  I didnt even know it was there!  The inside and atmosphere is pretty laid back and chill.  The sushi is good, we had 4 rolls and they were all good size and all tasted great!  Our waitress was very friendly and made sure we were always hydrated!  I am for sure gonna come back here!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here previously to meet some friends who were dying for the burger they used to have on the menu. Once we realize you don't have the burger anymore, the gin told us to go elsewhere. But, I have been DYING to have the Chicken Wonton Soup ever since.   So my bf and I came in for dinner last night. We started off with the crispy spring rolls which were awesome, my only complaint was having to share them. I don't like sharing.   I obviously ordered the wonton soup and he ordered some noodle dish. Since my soup came out 5 minutes before his meal, I was finished and staring at him eat, which I'm sure was quite annoying. Oh well, it caused him to offer to share his dinner with me and it was yummy!!  We took a vote after we left and decided to add this place into our rotation."}
{"text":"I dislike writing negative reviews but I have tried this place a dozen times over the past 3 years and before the food was okay, decent atmosphere, and the service was very poor.  Now the service was great! But the food did disappoint.  I ordered the surfer roll... It may have been the worst thing I have ever ordered.. I hope they read this review and change it but I won't be returning for at least 6 months to a year.."}
{"text":"Happy hour is designed to make one happy. The fact they had one sat evening with things I like on it made me happy for a new hours.  There are a few 1/2 priced sushi rolls like a Spicy tuna and Phily roll. 1/2 some apps and beer $3 specials.   The rolls are regularly 7.50 ish so 3.50 on happy hour, as for quality it was decent however with a spicy tuna or Phily roll it is hard to really mess them up. The added avacado to them was nice.  We also had a veggie spring roll $3.50 Then 1/2 off for happy hour.  A soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies sushi rice and peanut sauce. It was great like Vietnam meets Thailand.  They were nice enough to turn down the loud music for us make it a pleasant place to be, the curtains are cool and the beer selection included some micro brews. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Had very low expectations given some of the reviews read but despite busy lunch crowd, service was good and food solid.  Easy in/out for business discussion with client."}
{"text":"Moto is yummy! I don't eat sea food so the only Sushi I eat is Cucumber Rolls or Vegetarian Rolls. There are plenty of variety of dishes to choose from that include build your own to include Sea Food, Chicken, Beef, and Vegetarian. You can also choose your temapture. The side dishes which some are included in the Happy Hour are very tasty.  I have been eating there of and on since the resturant moved in the neighboorhood. I can't say they always have the best customer service however recently I sat at the bar and the bartendar was the best. She really impressed me.   I don't drink but they have a large varitey of beers and wines. Many I have never seen or heard of to choose from. The bartendar told me the owner loves to switch the beer regulary to give different options.   If you are looking for a trendy place with a great variety of food this is the place to eat.  There is a full service bar with a creative Sushi Chef to watch. It is a small resturant with a big menu."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI/ASIAN DINING & CRAFT BEER COMBO you will find in the state of Arizona. The craft beer selection alone is the best in a 5 mile radius, and they have high quality sushi and Asian food on top of that. Neighborhood place, friendly vibe, outstanding service. Definitely worth checking out..."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Everyone dining with us absolutely loved it. Good level of spicyness, and good system to tell how spicy things are. Good service as well, and willing and able to change orders. Will be coming back here."}
{"text":"My oldest daughter and I are trying a different sushi place every month Moto at 16th and Bethany was our first.  It's a pretty busy corner with the sprouts and Mcdonalds but parking wasn't an issue.  We were seated pretty quickly as there was no waiting for a patio seat.  Everyplace we go we will order the California roll and tootsie roll.  The California roll tasted so fresh I was actually surprised. It was very tasty and we both loved it.  The tootsie roll was also very good. The eel aside was very sweet and tasty. I had a hard time tasting the fish in the tootsie roll but I enjoyed it nonetheless. We used the low sodium soy sauce and that was rather salty the wasabi was fresh as was the ginger.  We give it 4 fish heads out of 5"}
{"text":"I had a great meal tonight. When I went to In-N-Out burger after wasting my time in the WORST STEAMING PILE OF CRAP RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX!  Even the water was terrible!  Half of the food was cold when it was served 15 minutes after the first dishes hit the table.   DO NOT WASTE TOUR TIME AND THINK THAT YOU WILL HAVE GOOD FOOD OR SERVICE HERE.   Get a frozen lean cuisine rice bowl, open it and put it under your fridge and let the mice relieve themselves in it for a few days ... you'll be much better off"}
{"text":"Best. Wonton. Soup. Ever!!!!! I'm Asian and I have had A LOT of wonton soup in my life. Why is it so good? It's the broth. It tastes like the product of hard work and a lot of time, like maybe one of those recipes that's a 26-step process with hours to rise/chill/whatever in between. It's not too salty, and has the perfect blend of spices. If this soup were a person, it would be the guy who hardly speaks, but when he does the few words he says make a lasting impact.   The wontons themselves are average, they could stand to be a little bigger. But they are supported by the magical broth. I am noting that the next time I catch a cold, I'm ordering a big bowl of Moto's wonton soup for pickup!"}
{"text":"Another new place discovered through my Sushi group.  As has been common, large groups with seperate checks tend to challenge them, but the food was propery delivered and very delious.  I enjoyed my standard Philly Roll as well as a Mark Roll and Mayflower Roll, all of which was very good.  I look forward to another opportunity to return and try other rolls on the menu.  Oh and you definetly have to try the MOJOS, very tastey desert."}
{"text":"Its our second time here and they messed up our order both times and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"I never eat sushi here but i LOVE their spicy teriyaki chicken bowl  Love it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Aside from the witty menu, the food is top notch! I usually get a bowl and my husband usually gets the riblets. I also almost always start with the caterpillar roll, it is super cute and always cures my craving. I recently ordered the grilled shrimp tacos, they were impressive. I will be ordering those again! I may have a new favorite! Fantastic atmosphere and always spectacular service. It's probably one of the best places to meet for lunch or have a nice dinner. I never feel over or under dressed whether I'm going casual or dressed up for a date with the hubby. It's a comfortable, moderately priced, great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I gave Moto a few tries because it was the closest sushi place to where I was living (would get it for take out).  Each time I was mildly disappointed....sushi is medicore, nothing really stood out to me.  Their salmon sashimi is smoked, wierd in my opinion being a sashimi lover.  Wish I could them better, but not impressed."}
{"text":"Started coming here about a year ago for the saturday all you can eat days. For the price it can't be beat. I have been here at least 15 times now and the fish is almost always fresh and good, a few times i have had a bad piece but even the best places I have been get a bad one once in awhile. The selection isn't the largest on the all you can eat but the basics are all covered with tuna, yellowtail, unagi, las vegas rolls, spicy tuna, philly, boston, alaska and spicy yellowtail all being on the list. The dessert they have the mojos are of a kind and different all the tie but never a disappointment if you have room after all the sushi.  They also have a full bar and often feature different specialty brews here as well. You can also add a sake bomber to your all you can eat for i think $4 so not a bad deal.  The gripes here is that the service is not the best as the waitresses know that they add 20% tip to all of the all you can eat bills s they don't seem to try to hard. it can take awhile to get a drink refilled (unless its alcohol and an extra charge). The other thing is that it can take awhile for the sushi to get done. I have no problem with this most days as for the amount of food I and my friends orders it takes awhile to make but on occasion it can be excessive.  Despite the fact that there are other all you can eats closer to me I willingly drive the 20-30min to come here on Saturdays. For $17 this is a great deal and a good place to eat.  P.S. if you ride a motorcycle they have helmet/jacket hooks inside and allow parking on the side walk as the owner is a rider."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite Sushi places to date.  You have to be \"in the know\" & ask for the \"underground sushi menu\", the one that doesn't exist!  The service can be a bit slow, the but the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"C'mon, Moto. Get your act together. I've been eating here for years and have experienced how both the service and food quality has gotten poorer and poorer. Service, while polite, is always extremely slow no matter whether it's busy or not. I've put up with that because I love the B Noodles so much, but the last half dozen or so times I've ordered it, it tastes like a completely different dish. Awful consistency. Not worth the gamble anymore, time for me to find a new noodle dish elsewhere."}
{"text":"I always look for a good sushi place during my travels. I found one here in Phoenix at Moto sushi. They have style with a unique flair, classy yet casual, and tasty sushi. I've always received friendly service on my visits and they keep my glass full; these are a must to satisfy me. They have outdoor seating and the patio is dog friendly.  The sushi is good and they have many interesting combinations. Best of all they have spicy sushi rolls. I love the April roll and the Volcano roll.  The decor is modern. They have bar seating where you can watch the rolls made. The music is eclectic and at just the right noise level to clearly hear it, yet not have to scream to talk to the people at the other side of the table.  I've visited Moto on several occasions and will be here several more before I leave."}
{"text":"I work very close to Moto and take advantage of this place as much as possible.  The food is great, well priced and the beer selection is perfect.  I generally get one of their bowls, a sushi spread or the always awesome Moto Chicken Salad.  The atmosphere is great at the bar with friendly staff, multiple TV's to give you something to watch during lunch, and a well done happy hour menu.  If you want to sit down they offer tables for all size parties and booths to sink into.    What I like about Moto is that is a stand alone restaurant with a great menu, great staff, well thought out bar, simple yet keen beer selection in a friendly casual dining environment.  I never feel over or under dressed and I don't feel like they are tying too hard to stand out.  They let their menu, staff and great environment do that for them and it makes a great atmosphere.  I have never left Moto feeling let down or charged too much.  Everything is well balanced and I really appreciate that.  I definitely recommend Moto for anyone looking for a great casual sushi place that offers really great sushi, drinks and other menu items at a reasonable price.  A++"}
{"text":"This place is more of a bar than a sushi restaurant. This sushi is pretty average. The quality and freshness just isn't quite there. I've been to many sushi joints in my time, and can tell you that Moto sushi is a decent place for your average sushi consumer, but won't impress most others. Rolls are pretty generic, and sloppily made. Service was good, which is why it gets 2 stars. Prices are up there among better restaurants, so I suggest you look elsewhere cuz it ain't cheap. They have a happy hour menu, and also an all-you-can eat menu...if that interests you. They are the only sushi joint within a few miles, otherwise the competition would eat them up in no time. You can try it for yourself, but I'm just trying to save you a few bucks here..."}
{"text":"The food & beverages at Moto are awesome.  The service needs a little help, as they don't always check on you to see if you need another beer or a water refill. They might just need more staff.  I award 4 stars because I know I will be back for the beer and food. Awesome selection of craft brews on tap, only $3/glass during happy hour (3pm - 6:15pm). Cheap appetizers during happy hour too. Win!  Numerous veggie choices (that are actually GOOD).   The wonton nachos minus meat were awesome.  The tofu yakisoba was awesome.  The veggie rolls were awesome.  I wish this place was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Recently went back here for a special beer tasting and would have to say everything was a step up from the first time I was there except for the fact that it still smelled by fish.  don't know what they need to do to get rid of that smell but it would be a bit more pleasant if they did...might even get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"You might want to reconsider ordering the PHO.  Completely flavorless.  My guess would be the broth is made from a powered mix.  Add the fact that they charge $10 makes it even worse.  Meatballs were rubbery, sliced beef dry and chewy.   Owners need to consider taking this off the menu.  Would have sent it back but a co-worker went on a lunch run and picked this up for me to go.  Gross, Gross Gross...."}
{"text":"Service was good - I was disappointed by a lukewarm miso soup and almost cold brown rice.  We ordered the sushi/sashimi platter to share, and it tasted fine with an okay presentation. The green tea is unique and refreshing. We ordered the small Moto for dessert - and that was delicious and a small was plenty for two people.  Overall, if I was really craving sushi and I was near 16th Street and Glendale, I'd go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for Moto."}
{"text":"OUR EXPERIENCE WAS OFFENSIVE. Worst sushi in town. Way overpriced. Bad service. Sushi was rubbery, so we ordered sweet potato fries, wontons, soup Etc and it was all disappointing. What a waste of a date night!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and stopped in recently for lunch. I had the pad thai this time which was good but felt it was missing something. Not quite sure. I really wish they had lunch specials there as I think I might go there a bit more during the work week. I will go back but it's not at the top of my list.  I sat at the bar and the service was great (always has been good the two times I've been to Moto)."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times now and cannot stop raving about it!! I was lucky enough to have had a girlfriend that worked there a while back tell me about the \"hidden menu\" that no one really knows about. I ordered the \"Senorita\" off that menu and have been going back for it ever since. Of course their happy hour is RIDICULOUS, so cheap and really good!! I feel sorry for the waitresses because of all the horrible customers they must get that don't know how to tip at happy hour (in case you don't know its always tip what the meal would have been before the discount). But if they have bad customers I wouldn't know, I always get the best service!!  Awesome, yummy, and healthy! Now go have some Sushi;)"}
{"text":"Ok. Appetizer calamari came out room temperature, told server,  new calamari came hot. Fine fixed. Kids orange chicken  comes out first, good recovery. But, our food....hmmmm, kid finished bowl before we got ours, not terrible, but odd. Exit Wound bowl, delicious and a lot of food. Starts out not spicy but then grows on you, by last bite my mouth is comfortably warm it was good. Now more bad, wife's Pho comes out considerably later than my food, beef in pho is a little off, maybe D grade beef? But the bowl is huge. BUT 4 pieces of beef a little bigger than an oreo cookie. Asked the server if this was the norm and she said yes in a uninterested voice. 2 good dishes, bad delivery of entrées, not exciting pho and meh service. We'll stick sushi from Moto from here on"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G their roles are huge and great. I went with a friend who lives over that way. The owners were so nice and friendly. I cant believe I am just finding this place.   The underground menu is now public... I thought that was kind of cool tho, what I heard of it.   Only con, the waitress was a little slow, but she was nice and they were busy...so I will give her that :)"}
{"text":"For the last time we decided to go back, little did we know we got the same waitress and she had more of an attitude this time. She was rude to my sister and that is the last straw with this place. When I worked in the food industry I was nice to even those who I thought didn't deserve my kindness, but it was MY JOB AND I DECIDED TO WORK THERE but I guess that is dead and gone. I'd rather go and pay more at a scottsdale restaurant then having to deal with a waitress who seems to always be in a crappy mood. Also, she ended up charging us wrong which came out to more, but why bother arguing with someone who is already sour."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Moto for 5+ years and have seen a lot of turn over. The last few years the management has shown A LOT of improvement! Charity is one of our FAVORITE bartenders in central phx. She's never suggested one thing we haven't liked. She shows a PERFECT example of leaving personal issues at the door, like any GREAT bartender should do. I have always had a great experience at Moto, the owner really knows how to run a successful business!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this place over the last 2 years for lunch.  Hadn't been in for a while and stopped in to get a \"to-go\" order last evening to take home for dinner, BIG MISTAKE!!!  Ordered the chicken bowl (which I always get) with brown rice, teriyaki sauce (orange NOT spicy) with vegis.  Also ordered the crab puffs, hadn't had them here before and I was extra hungry!  The crab puffs were burnt on the edges, all of them!  Had to crack off all the burnt sides and was left with the soggy middle.  How to you burn the edges and undercook the middle?  The crab part was lack luster.  The aioli side sauce that is served with these, well lets say I had high expectations and the sauce fell waaaaay short of being at all tasty, bland...bland...bland...  On to the chicken bowl.  I was surprised to see that the chicken is now served in square chunks.  Wow, someone forgot to put ANY seasoning on the chicken, again bland!!!  They also put the spicy teriyaki sauce on my meal which I did not order so my main course of the meal was ruined!    So, $16.00 later, I had about 1/3 of the appetizer that could even be consumed and threw that out and my dinner, well, the 96% full container went in the trash.  I'm not even going to risk my money on gong back for lunch.  I was truly let down.  Lack of seasoning and lack of general cooking skills in preparation coupled with the wrong sauce on the order, too many other options (Pei Wei here I come)!"}
{"text":"The lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day. Disappointing, since they tout their Vietnamese selections as being specialties. The pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles I was expecting. Portions are certainly generous enough... I like that you can make your own rice bowl. That's the direction I recommend if you come here."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I'm not a big sushi eater but they have a lot more than sushi, their fish tacos are some of the best in the valley and if you like hot foods they have a select choice of those too. Great atmosphere, televisions so you don't miss any games while having great food at the same time."}
{"text":"Poor service,offensive material on the menu. Not recommended if you ever order take out/ to go orders...your food would likely sitting on counter, lying, waiting, forgotten. take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I frequent this place, it is in the neighborhood and has great sushi rolls.  We went for happy hour and ordered 3 sushi rolls and 2 appetizers, which were all only $5 each.  We had the wings which were crispy and amazing, as well as the crispy gyoza served with cilantro and ponzu sauce.  My favorite roll was the Alaska roll which has smoked salmon on top with crab mix inside.  We sat at the bar and received excellent service.  They have a good selection of craft beers on tap and they will let you try samples to see which one you might prefer.  It has modern decor inside with original art on the wall, and a very pleasing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Moto's Happy Hour. What makes it great is you can get non-sushi items at Happy Hour in addition to sushi. This is a good compromise when you are going with someone who isn't wild about sushi. They do only offer 4 rolls during the Happy (Kalifornia, Tootsie, Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna) but all four are fresh and delicious. We also tried the asian nachos which we both thought were amazing! They are made with friend wontons some kind of spicy cheese, chicken and avocado. (I'm sure there was more on it but we ate it so fast there wasn't time for much research.)   You can't beat the Happy hour prices!  For 2 people we had a total of 3 beers, 3 orders of sushi and a small asian nacho and it came to $24. One big improvement over last time was the service was much faster. This place is good for dinner and the AYCE Sushi on Saturdays, but for a first timer I would really recommend the Happy Hour over anything else."}
{"text":"As I write this I am trying to contain my anger. Walked in at 6:15 was seated immediately. Great. Sat for 10 minutes before the HOSTESS came to us and offered us water. She brings us water and we play the waiting game. 6:40 we had to call the HOSTESS over to take our order and we're a little irritated. Still have not been seen by a single server. Now it's 7:10. Appetizer is not out and we see servers walking around and it took a while for one to notice us. She came over asked if we were doing okay. We told her honestly no. And she immediately took action and did what a good server would do. She showed concern and wanted to fix it. The only good customer service was shown by the hostess Kaylie and the server Charity. Charity managed to comp our meal. We really appreciate their work and honestly the rest of the staff needs to look to them as examples of good customer service. I will be possibly coming back but next time i guess we just have to accept the fact we'll be playing the waiting game. Still good food though. They got that going for them."}
{"text":"The owner here is a jackass. They recently put up a giant banner that says \"we (heart) you long time\", with the (heart) being a caricature of a geisha. It's super racist, as if they put up a banner that said \"ching chong\" on it. I told the owner in a very kind note - just letting him know, in case he wasn't already aware, that many people of Asian descent find that phrase and that image offensive, and he responded with a bunch of laughing emojis! If you go to their website, it says the owner is the \"first anglo sushi chef in Arizona\" - big whoop, but clearly race (particularly the white race) matters to this guy. So if you like your California roll served with a big white sheet, enjoy, but otherwise I would steer clear."}
{"text":"I have been to Moto a couple of times and the food is good.  However last week we had TERRIBLE service!  We arrived around 8:15 and the sign said they close \"nine-ish\".  I asked our server about a wine on the menu and she said it was new.  My friend asked if she could bring a taste, and her answer was \"i don't think so.  It comes in a bottle\".  We said - we only want a glass and she repeated the same thing. ( Is that as opposed to a box?)   I just ordered it anyway and low and behold it was not very good.   We then ordered our food.  My two friends ordered sushi.  They were just starting to eat when a server came by and asked for the soy sauce.  My friends asked if she was going to replace it, and she said no - she needed to clean it for the night.  She forced my friends to load up on the soy sauce so she could take it.  The rest of the night the staff proceeded to hound us and ask us if they could take our plates - even when we were still eating.  This was not much past 9.  I know we were running a bit late, but there were still other people in the restaurant.  And finally, we were sitting outside and one of the staff members came out and loudly cleared his sinuses and spit on ground near us.  It was just gross.  Food is good - not great.  Definitely not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"All you can eat limited sushi on Saturday for around $20. Sold. I crashed Dottsy Z's  party with two other lovely ladies (Hi Amber and Debi) this past Saturday after literally stepping off of a plane and seeing her post that she was here. The funny thing was that I wasn't really hungry, until I saw all the yummy food in front of me. Eel rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Toosie Maki Rolls, Spicy Tuna Rolls, good lawd I was in heaven. I ate so much that I arrived looking \"skinny\" and I left looking as if I was expecting a baby sometime in the very near future lol. Sad case yes. Our waitress was extremely nice but a little overworked since it appeared as if she was working the entire restaurant solo. So if you are hankering for some sushi, go on a Saturday over to Moto Sushi. But be warned, you must eat everything that you order if you order off the all you can eat, or you will be charged 50 cents per piece that you leave on your plate. So don't overdo it. (We left nada! lol)"}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona, so I'm constantly looking for great sushi/sashimi. I've been here twice and the second time was just to confirm what I'd expected. The first visit was mediocre at best, mostly due to poor service. The 2nd time was this evening.  I arrived during a shift change, or so I thought. Two couples arrived a minute after and sat on opposite sides of me.  After 8 minutes, the server greeted both couples and served water... I'm still waiting and pretty peeved.  I abruptly left.  So, I guess I'm still in the hunt for an authentic sushi bar. Very, disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is Disgusting!!! Rice is Overcooked, tasted like a baby food  My California Rolls did not even looked like ones. Lunch menu was way too small for the price.  All-You-Can eat was a disaster. It took them 45 min to bring second order of rolls which we could not even eat, because they had NO Taste !!! Service is way too slow as well their chefs which I think would make a much better job cooking Salsa.  Save your time and money and try to stay away from that Sushi JOKE Place!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely adore Moto. Delicious sushi, friendly wait staff, what more do you need? I think the only drawback may be the parking situation, but if you aren't in breakneck heels, you can always find a spot closer to the grocery market. The wings are delicious, the Asian nachos are kinda messy but taste okay, looking forward to trying some other menu items!"}
{"text":"MOTO has good PHO but service is a little SLOW. Sushi pretty good. Nice little bar food escape."}
{"text":"Come here once every couple of weeks. Love there classified bowl although it is extremely spicy so beware - they will warn you.  Dane has been my server a few times now and is awesome. The entire staff seems very friendly and will definitely continue to keep coming here.  I miss there all you can eat sushi Saturdays during happy hour."}
{"text":"How this place has even 3.5 stars i will never understand.  Pretty much all of the bad stuff that you read in these reviews is spot on. We used to live not far from this place and so had been there twice before both times the service was painfully slow and the food was mediocre at best. But some time has passed and people kept writing good reviews so we thought \"hey why not give them another chance?\" the answer is simply, \"because they scuk.\"  Years have passed yet the service is still the worst of any restaurant I have been to in the last 5 years. The waiters pretty much ignore you once you are seated. And once they take your order? Forget about it. Refill on a drink? Forget about it. Don't like how the food tastes? Forget about it. I have only had equally bad sushi at Albertson's. Both the presentation and the flavor seriously left something to be desired. If you're even considering this place for happy hour, let alone dinner ignore the bad reviews at your own risk. I have three words for you- forget about it."}
{"text":"So I have to say, when my friends tried to get me to try and all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, I wasn't thrilled, but it's awesome!  Moto is a small restaurant in central Phoenix (16th St and Glendale) that offers all-you-can-eat Sushi on Saturday from 11:30am-2:20pm.  And I must say, it's not just California Rolls, the special features some of my favorites; philly, las vegas, tootsy, eel, and much more.  The special is about $17 bucks, which you easily pay for two specialty rolls.  The rules to teh special are cute too, so don't over order because you'll pay 50 cents for each piece left. :-)  Also, make sure you try to Mojo, which is a dessert sushi roll.  It's ice cream (flavor chanegs everyday but we were lucky to get caramel) wrapped lie a sushi roll, but the rice is rice crispy!  Definitely a place to try if you love sushi like I do!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about the good things at Moto.  1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with \"typical\" beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their \"lite\" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies.   Along with the beer comes an in-frequent \"beer celebration\" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event.    2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be \"to-go\" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3\" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.  I've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.   3. Desert - The \"Mojos\" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.   4. The \"Underground\" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving.    5. The \"all you can eat\" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.   And now the downside:  1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the \"rice bloat\" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an \"underground\" roll (mentioned above).   2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.    That's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a \"sushi experience\", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers."}
{"text":"The appetizers were yummy:  Asian Nachos - LOVED IT!  Gyoza - Good  Wonton Soup - 2 wontons and salty soup base  I did not tried the rolls but the girls ordered a Kalifornia and Tootsie   For my entree, I got the sesame chicken with brown rice. I thought the sesame chicken was going to be salt, but it was the sweet sauce coating the fried chicken pieces. It was ok but a little tad sweeter than I like. Everyone had a fun time. I knocked them down to four stars because the service was terrible. We had to flag or get our waitress every time. She never refilled drinks or come back to check on the table. We had to get her attention and sometimes she is no where to be found."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  The food and service is going downhill.  Last night entrees arrived 15 minutes apart.  Manager who appeared to be about 16 said it was because they have two kitchens? Apparently they don't talk to each other. Avoid"}
{"text":"This is some of the most disappointing, poorly prepared, blandest and over-priced sushi/sashimi I've ever had. There was a bone in my salmon sashimi. No plans to return."}
{"text":"Here's the thing... shortly after being seated the waitress spilled an entire pint glass of water DIRECTLY in my lap.  She was extremely embarassed and very apologetic, and I was good natured about the incident because after all, it was just water.  However, what bothered me was the fact that no manager or lead came to the table to apologize or at least buy me a beer.  There are three people at my table cleaning up ice and water, and an hour later I leave your restaurant STILL wet and you can't take a moment to address the situation? It left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addititon, the happy hour menu is rather limited and the sushi isn't bad, but not memorable either.  I'd much rather do happy hour at Ra or some other more consistant establishment."}
{"text":"I was very surprised with the prices. This place is good and the sushi is cheap. The waitress we had gave us what she called the underground sushi menu. These are creative and all sounded good but we had the April roll. Tempura shrimp. real crab, cream cheese, jalapeno, the whole roll was tempura and topped with spicy tuna. OMG freakin awesome, see pic. I liked this roll so much I went back a few days later and got it again. We also had sesame shrimp with noodles and it was delicious. Great food, and great prices. Good atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a Four step entree bowl through Postmates, I asked for crispy tofu and received steamed, there were a few pieces of carrots and broccoli ($2 upcharge) and rice. It was lackluster. I has really hungry and wanted something filling and this did not do it."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way I didn't even leave tip.The only thing that was right was 2 rolls we ordered and the drink order.I've been eating sushi longer than our server has been alive.But for some reason our server felt the need to tell us that nigiri is sushi which I clearly said sushi not rolls nor sashimi.Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Sushi, sushi, sushi. My friend and I stopped in after a fun day of pool crashing at the Biltmore. I ordered an edamame and Las Vegas Roll (my fav.) and she got a double order of sashimi. We were pleased with the fast and attentive service. The food presentation was impressive (beautiful, actually) and the  food was delicious.   I just read someone's review about All You Can Eat Saturdays? I'll have to check that out!  Great job, Moto. We'll be back."}
{"text":"So I'm not changing my stars on this updated review, but I finally came for happy hour. I really did like their happy hour - $5 sushi rolls..What?! They weren't bad either. I had the tootsie roll and the Alaska roll.   I also ordered the crab puffs. I would pass on this. Draft beers are $5. Our bill: 2 rolls, crab puffs, one beer, one wine = $25 excl tip. Not bad, Moto. Not bad.   Service can improve though. Our server sucked."}
{"text":"I have met friends here several times, as it is a centrally located spot for those of us coming from all directions. I would highly recommend the Asian Nachos and any of the beers they offer.  Where Moto falls short is in their wait staff. Every single time I have been here, the wait staff is highly distracted and it takes a long time for them to come check on tables. Is it because they are short staffed or not really interested in customer service? I shouldn't have to wait every visit for my water glass to be refilled. Good food, not so great on the service."}
{"text":"My husband and I, along with our neighbors, have been patrons of Moto for the last five years. Between the six adults, we have had decent experiences and have enjoyed the food. Unfortunately, this evenings experience will likely cause all of us to never return, and tell people not to go.   My husband and two friends went into Moto tonight to grab a drink and food to go. They sat at the bar and were served by Charity. When they walked in they ordered a drink and some sashimi to go. My husbands friend paid for this immediately. They enjoyed their drink and waited for the other to go food they ordered. Charity placed the bill in front of them and the credit card was placed on the bill. The credit card was run and then signed. Charity was tipped. They finished their drink and the food was placed down in front of them. For absolutely no reason, a man, later learned to be Enrique, from behind the bar snatched the food off of the bar stating that they had not paid for the food. When my husband told him they had paid and showed the receipt, Enrique disputed that the signed receipt was for the food that had just been handed to them. Enrique proceeded to go to the other side of the bar with the food that they had already paid for.   During this interaction he was very disrespectful, implying that they were going to walk on the bill. The bill that they had already paid. Charity had to convince Enrique that the bill had been paid before she returned the food. She apologized and said \"that was my fault\". Charity and Enrique continued to argue as my husband and his friends left.   This was not Charity's fault. Enrique was out of line, disrespectful and blamed paying customers of attempting to steal. Awful.   After they got home, my husbands friend called to speak with a manager or the owner. Enrique answered the call and when my husbands friend indicated he was calling to speak with a manager about this situation, Enrique immediately became defensive. He went so far as to tell my husbands friend to come back to the restaurant to \"settle the issue\". He refused to put him into a manager or provide the owners information.  They never received an apology from Enrique.  Had Enrique just apologized for the miscommunication between the staff, this review would not have been posted."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to have to do this, but after a long hiatus I have to conclude that MOTO is not as good as it was when I wrote my rave review.  The mystique of the underground menu is gone. The not-so-underground menu now appears on the back of the regular menu :(  The quality of service and product has also gone down. Sigh."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot in Phoenix. The sushi is very well prepared and tastes delicious! Service is good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and mellow. Also their beer selection is a over average and they change the beer they carry all the time making it fun to try new ones. All in all I would recommend Moto to anyone."}
{"text":"I drive out of my way just to go here. I know a lot of people have had negative experiences but I can only speak to the one item I get, the exit wound bowl. It is really good, very spicy and has a great unique flavor."}
{"text":"The straight dope:  4.5 star bar for hopheads and craft brew fans:  Not particularly extensive in terms of number of offerings, but some sincere thought was put into the list and the result is a spectacular night's worth of excellent brew sampling.  Well done!  It would be nice if they had 12-year Yamazaki single malt to really put the cherry on top of their Japanese theme (even Benihana has that), and that would probably double my frequency of visits, but I guess they have plenty of the ordinary mid to top shelf liquors.     4.25 star ambience/decor.  Dark and modern.  Just how I like it.   4 star sushi/sashimi:  Our party of six tried about six rolls.  Nothing was left on the plates when we were done.  I found the quality to be high, but the execution and taste forgettable.  My wife would certainly disagree - she had the \"Senorita Roll\" on her mind for many days after we went there, and she went back again 2x over the span of 2 weeks just to get it.  4.25 star dishes and appetizers:  The spicy riblets are INSANE.  One would think that a chef would be a bit fearful of putting something out that is so intentionally overcooked and brittle...but it works!  And I think that is what is special about Moto...the menu has a nice dash of daring, unconventional twists on what could have been (and often is) just very ordinary fare at other places.    PS - the portion sizes of some dishes (like yakisoba) are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here, so if you attend with a group, don't be afraid to \"underorder\" a bit and to share it family-style."}
{"text":"It isn't easy to find good sushi in Phoenix. Usually, even if you do find it, you have to subject yourself to annoying house beats and dress up like you're going clubbing afterwards to fit in.   Which is why Moto is such an aberration. It's sandwiched between a Blockbuster and McDonalds at 16th St. and Glendale, so the cheezy factor can pretty much be immediately ruled out.   I remember this when it was still a Shogun Express, which I also enjoyed, but I must say, I like Moto even more. They have some creative appetizers including the Asian Nachos, which are essentially nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole but instead of tortilla chips, they use fried wontons. Genius, I tell you.   Happy hour prices are more than fair and the Caterpillar and Spicy Tuna rolls are some of the best I've found. Try the all-you-can-eat deal on the weekends, too . . . Hard to beat."}
{"text":"How disappointing!   2 1/2 hrs for lunch really? Poor service and waitress dropped the whole tray of sake and beer on the floor beside us. Then proceeded to clean it up while we sat another 10 mins without drinks.. No manager came by to check on us or bothered to say anything at all. I will be checking this place off my list"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a get away during the week. Daughter's boss meet us there on a Wednesday for lunch. (His recommendation)  Looked like a place for the \"cool in the know\" sitting in a strip mall area. Found the service to be very good and attentive.Food was excellent ! I had Chinese Chicken salad , half size was enough for two people ,can't imagine what a full order would have been. My daughter had the noodle bowl which again was enough for two people and her partner had fish tacos that was presented very nicely and she stated they were excellent.  Here i was thinking Sushi which i don't eat and it turn out to be a excellent choice by her boss who was\" cool and in the know.\""}
{"text":"I just experienced this restaurant for the second time.  My first time around, the food and service were decent and the nifty sushi dessert made the overall experience pretty cool.   The second time around, it was pretty horrendous.  My boyfriend and I were driving around trying to find a place on which we could both agree.  I was craving sushi, and he's not crazy about sushi.  Ultimately, Moto came to my mind--because they have some basic sushi rolls (although no raw salmon or really much raw nigiri to speak of) along with lots of other food.   So, Moto it was.  On arrival, as we walked up, we noticed a couple of empty tables inside so we weren't too worried about having to wait.  But, when we got inside, the host basically just pointed at a table at the bar, had us sit down, and then threw two menus onto the table and walked away.   As we sat at a table in the bar area--although we wanted to eat in the actual restaurant area--my boyfriend immediately noticed that the couple sitting behind us was completely hammered.  I listened for a moment, and indeed, they were screaming.  Screaming their conversation.  And they were discussing herpes sores.  They appeared to be on a date, discussing herpes sores, and the female occasionally mentioned her DAUGHTER.    So after listening to some loud herpes convo for a few moments, my boyfriend went and asked the host if they had a different table, inside the actual restaurant portion.  We were added to a list.    About 5 minutes later, a waitress approached, and I'm 99.9% sure that she was intoxicated.  Not just slightly inebriated, either, but kind of ridiculous drunk.  She looked all glazed over as she asked if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if they had a drink menu and she stared at me like she was really confused.  Then I asked if they had a cocktail menu, and she said, no, we have a menu of beer and wine.  She gave me a weird look.  So, thinking I was mistaken about the drink situation, I asked, do you guys have a full bar?   She said, oh, yes!  What do you like!?!?  I like fruity drinks, so I asked if they had Stoli Razzberri (or however it's spelled).  She said, \"I LOVE THAT.  THAT'S MY FAVORITE.\"  Then she informed me that she wasn't sure if they had it, but she would check.  My boyfriend (who was driving) requested a water, and the waitress walked away.   Eventually after enduring more conversation about that chick's kid and various human ailments (herpes, chicken pox, the flu), the host told us they had a table for us.  He walked us to the table and threw menus on it.  As he started to walk away, I mentioned to him that I had ordered a drink from the waitress at the other table and I didn't want her to wonder where we went.  He said he'd already told her about it, and not to worry.  A few seconds later, he brought the drink over and set it down.  Oddly, the drink was pink, and a Stoli Razz & tonic isn't usually pink.  But I figured it looked interesting so I'd give it a shot anyway.    Shortly thereafter, our actual waitress approached.  She immediately started LECTURING us about how we can't just order drinks at the bar and walk away without cashing out at the bar.  She went on for a while about how we needed to go back and cash out at the bar.  We explained that we never meant to sit at the bar, and that we had just gotten our drink at our actual table, and hadn't received it at the bar.  So then she kind of backed off after saying something weird, like, \"Oh, so you just got them?  Oh, okay, then you guys aren't too worried about it then I guess.\"  Then she started telling me about the drink I'd received, which wasn't the one that I ordered--it was some other type of vodka with actual fruit in it or something.  Then she gave me a long list of all the other types of fruit vodkas that they have.  I guess that was ok, and the drink ended up being pretty decent.  But it was still just....bizarre.   Anyway, we ordered our food.  That included a shrimp tempura roll, a squid salad, a regular sized order of the asian nachos, and a buffalo burger.    The shrimp tempura roll and squid salad came out first.  I'm an idiot who's terrible with chopsticks, and I didn't notice that we had no forks until the waitress was gone.  It took a while to obtain a fork.  But anyhow, the squid salad was pretty decent, typical for any sushi restaurant.  The roll was....ok.  The crab mix in it was kind of like what you could get in a crab salad sandwich at Subway.  It also had carrots in it, which were kind of overwhelming.    Then, out came the asian nachos.  The gigantic asian nachos.  She brought us a large instead of the regular that I ordered, and of course, charged us for the large.  I considered saying something, but I figured we'd just get a lecture.  We were only able to finish a small portion of them, because the large was freaking huge.  Fortunately they were good.    Maybe we misread, but the buffalo burger was made with buffalo, not buffalo sauce.    Moto is not very good."}
{"text":"First off let me say this, I came back to this place for its wings and sushi. We walked in and greeted by the bartender, she sat us in her section. Mine you she is super busy, ( I have a habit of paying attention to things going on around me) we placed our started right away with her with 2 waters while we looked at the menu. I noticed the wings we ordered sat in the window, she pushes them aside to make our drinks, two other people including what I believe was the manager, guy finally helped the bartender get water for guest coming in. While the other young lady/server pushed our wings to the side and proceeded to grab food behind the wings and take the food to the assign table/person. What pissed me off was why not help each other and deliver the food. When our wings did reach our table, they arrived COLD!!!! I sent it back, and decided to cancel my whole order. I'm writing this review so the employees at this establishment see it, and work to make things right. Help each other out when it's busy. Don't lose customers!! You sure did lose 2 today!!! I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We went out and got the happy hour and Mike was helping us at the bar. He was friendly attentive and funny   We had Philly roll, salmon sashimi, and the spicy salmon roll. We like salmon.   Basically I come here and sometimes have a bad experience but Mike totally changed that. He was a great bartender."}
{"text":"This Business has been my go to Sushi restaurant for some time now. It's a small quaint establishment. The food is good and and they have a great selection for everyone...even if you don't like sushi. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because sometimes the food does take a little to long to get to you, and the business  it self is kind of small. There isn't a lot of seating especially when it's busy.  Otherwise, I enjoy eating here and will continue to frequent Moto."}
{"text":"The best, freshest sushi in Central Phoenix! Service is always great and staff friendly. Sushi Happy Hour is rather short and limited but I hear the AYCE is fantastic."}
{"text":"The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet."}
{"text":"I used to live right around the corner from this little treat, luckily it is close to work so we can still conveniently enjoy it!   The ironic part of Moto for me, I absolutely LOVE sushi but I order other items on the menu here because they are so freakin' tasty. Two of my favorites include the Moto Chicken Salad (cabbage, chicken, peanuts, celery, green onion tossed in a light sesame vinagrette) and comes in 2 sizes - regular and large. The large is huge - fyi!  The chicken teriyaki bowl is so \"clean\" - excellent pieces of all-white meat, no chewy surprises... with your choice of white or brown rice. I like the brown rice. The sauce is a sweeter version of teriyaki, but great consistency. Avoid the miso soup - just one salty mess.   Randomly tried their dessert, called \"Mojos\" - and they really brought out the \"fat kid\" in me!!! These rolls consist of Nutella, brownie and ice-cream rolled out with a layer of rice krispie treat and then sliced. Gotta atleast try them once!   Great little neighborhood joint. Spent many a night drinking wine on the adorable little patio area."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"These awful reviews are hilarious. I've been in the service industry over 10 years and I find the blatant honesty of the \"you order it to pay for it\" to be exactly what all restaurants should do. Unless there is something extremely wrong with your food item, (which there has never been at Moto for me) then eat it and stop looking for a free meal. Moto has my favorite happy hour in all of Phoenix. Constantly fantastic beer selections and the service has always been great. At times slow, but always very polite. Also, those of you reading too much into the signage out front, get a life."}
{"text":"I've got to say these other reviews are absolutely absurd. After meeting the owner and talking to the bartenders/servers this place is a gem to find this sort of quality and pricing. The food here is absolutely phenomenal and the staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate any sort of requests you have within reason. The beer selection alone is worth bragging about and the prices are cheap compared to the other places charging you over $10 a beer. So if you're looking for a place with amazing beer and cocktails and quality food this is the place you're looking for. Please don't go off these other reviews that some people want to put down for this amazing restaurant. Please appreciate quality food and beverages without all the other bullshit."}
{"text":"Nice little place, great decor and the food was awesome!  Tried 3 sushi rolls: spicy salmon, spicy tuna and tootsie.  For dinner entree I got their chicken katsu, probably the best I've ever had...light and crispy.  Their Asian slaw is phenomenal.  Portion size is HUGE... The server, Suzanne is so attentive and cordial."}
{"text":"Just got back from Moto, and my wife is taking a Benadryl and having an allergic reaction because they contaminated her food with shrimp even after she told them she has an allergy.  When our food came out, the rolls were on the same plate (I had shrimp), so my wife apologized for the problem but let the waitress know that cross-contamination was a concern. The waitress took the rolls away, but them brought the same ones back on separate plates while assuring us that the staff had changed gloves in between making them, and that there was no way there would be an issue.  We left after being chastised by management for not explicitly stating there was an allergy problem when we placed our order (we made the mistake of being first-time customers and not knowing that things come out plated together). Apparently its not good enough to try to clarify when the food arrives. The manager told us it was our fault for not telling the waitress at the time we placed our order, and indicated that they refuse to remake rolls when there is an allergen concern.  So, we got blamed for my wife's allergic reaction, and the food wasn't even good. Even without this terrible customer service and allergy issue, we wouldn't consider going back."}
{"text":"Asian Nachos, Exit Wound Bowl and a great beer selection. We come here every week and its definitely a unique place. If you're craving a little fusion try this place out!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place since the underground menu was actually something secret and cherished. I get why you shared it, I'm Still so OG I took a photo of the paper version! Took a friend for his first and it was awesome! Jalapenko roll and Volcano are favs. To the yelp haters (the best part is where they call you out on the menu!) Did you try it more then once? Where you pissed because it was busy? Did your handcrafted sushi take to long? Go to revolving sushi then! This place is worth a forty mile drive for a friends first time sushi! Try the Mojo's your inner fat kid will thank you! If you don't like fish why are you here? Moto on!  I'll keep coming long as I'm in state and I love breaking in sushi virgins here! Tess was amazing! If you think you can handle hot order mustard gas and tell us about it in your review!"}
{"text":"Menu and prices look great, but no vegan sauce options for the 4-step entrées (bowls/plates) or noodle dishes. :( Everything is chicken stock based, except the curry, which is vegetarian and made with dairy cream instead of coconut milk (yuck!). Was really hoping for a new noodle spot. Bummer."}
{"text":"came for the bourbon and will be back for the food. The Jalapanko roll is stupid good. Cant wait to have it again. The philly was just ok to me but my wife really like the freshness and the taste. Little dry to me and my daughter ordered cali rolls everywhere and she needed something to dip it into.  My cousin ordered the Moto wings with the gas mustard sauce for an appetizer for us and if you like spicy you will like it, it is spicy, he always orders the hottest thing on the menu and always tells them to make it as hot as they can.. He also ordered The Classified bowl and didnt have to say anything about making it hot and it ended up being the hottest dish he has ever had. So good job MOTO !! .. I tried a few pieces and it had some great flavor. If you think you like spicy then try this and maybe you wont anymore.. spiciest dish in arizona. to top it off for the 5 stars was the service. Great!"}
{"text":"I will begin by saying that I've been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.   Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.  My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. I'll be back.  *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future"}
{"text":"Las Vegas roll was so AMAZING!!! There was another one that was kind of sweet caramel kind of thing that had sesame seeds so, so GOOD!!!  So worth the drive from the west Soooo Worth It!!!"}
{"text":"I've been on a hiking kick lately and am trying to find different ones to try.  Decided to try Piestewa Peak (or Squaw Peak depending on who you ask) but was going to meet up with a friend for lunch beforehand and we found Moto not too far away.  I got there first, a little before 11 which is when they open.  There were a couple people waiting but nothing outrageous.  I walk in and get acknowledged right away by the bartender who lets me know that someone will be right up to seat me and sure enough, as he was finishing that statement the waitress came over and took me to a table.  She also brought me water right away which always makes me happy.  While I was waiting for my friend to show up I read over the menu and was super excited to find out that not only do they have All You Can Eat Sushi, but that it was happening RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT!!  Apparently it's on Saturdays from 11-2:30 and there's 10 different rolls you can choose from for $18.99 (there are some nigiri options too but I don't remember how many there were to choose from for those).  Once my friend showed up I quickly told him about the All You Can Eat special so then he perused the menu to see which ones he wanted.  Our waitress kind of went MIA at this point so that was a little annoying but she seemed to be the only server there so I can't fault her for that but seriously you would think that the management there would keep the place a little bit better staffed on a weekend day during an all you can eat special.  Once our waitress came by for our order my friend got the Tootsi Roll, the Vegas Roll and the Alaska Roll.  I decided that I probably didn't want to binge on sushi right before a hike so I stuck with a single Rainbow Roll.  They took a little bit of time to come out but then again sushi typically does and I'm sure everyone who was in the restaurant was ordering tons of different rolls.  I was happy with the size, the rolls were larger than most places but not so huge that you had a hard time eating a piece.  My Rainbow Roll was delicious!  All the ingredients were fresh and beautiful.  I'll admit I did share one piece of my friend's Vegas Roll (sharing is against the rules according to the menu...oops!) and it was pretty good.  Not the best Vegas Roll I've had but still good.  I'll definitely be coming back here again on another Saturday when I don't plan on hiking so that I can actually partake in the All You Can Eat!"}
{"text":"I will really miss the Asian Nachos, they've always been my favorite - been dining here for years, but I will never be back. Our spicy yellowtail roll tasted so fishy that it was inedible, but the chef said it was not his problem because he just made it yesterday. That's hilarious, right? Because, he was serious and the poor waitress had to deliver the good news.  I know the owners don't care about this review, as it clearly states on the menu: Which is just  as funny as two-day-old sushi. If only your service was as good as your ego is big, your Yelp reviews wouldn't suck."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the horrible service I had on Saturday.    My bf and I decided to have a date day filled with sushi and a movie.  We arrived at Moto and were seated promptly at a table by the bar.  The restaurant wasn't packed at all and we seemed to arrive at just the right time.  Our server, Lilia didn't great us for nearly 5 minutes then she took almost 10 minutes to bring us our iced teas.  She took our order of the all you can eat sushi and it wasn't too long before our sushi came out.  She never once came back in the middle of our meal to see how the sushi was and showed up as I was consuming my last piece of sushi.  Normally, the servers will come back a few minutes after dropping off the first round of sushi and from there they will take your next order to make sure you get prompt service.  Just as I was eating my last piece of sushi she showed up and took our second order.  Our ice teas were low and she never offered to refill them.  We were watching the time and noticed our movie was starting within 40 minutes so we were a little concerned.  After sitting there for 20 minutes after putting in our second order, we asked the bartender if we had an order waiting for us.  He informed us she put it in but it wasn't up yet.  Lilia was literally wondering around aimlessly and didn't look that busy so we were a little upset that she was giving us horrible service.  She finally decided to come over and give us an ETA of when our last order would be up and we asked for our bill so we could pay and leave after we ate.  We let her know we still wanted our last order but we were just trying to make a movie.  She grabbed us our bill then came back and took our plates and cleaned off the table.  We were absolutely confused and asked the bartender about our order.  He told us that she cancelled our last sushi order and we informed the bartender that we didn't tell her to do that.  At this point we were fuming mad and just ready to leave because I knew if I had spoken to the manager I would've blown up.  On top of that we missed our movie and just decided to go home.  We spent $49.70 on sushi and that included a 20% gratuity tip that they automatically put on for the all you can eat sushi.  She honestly wasn't worth the $8.28 tip that I was forced to pay.  I seriously feel like I've been ripped off and the server received a 20% tip for pretty much doing nothing.  I come here all the time and I've never had bad service like this before.  The girls are normally attentive and want to turn their tables so they make more money, which makes sense.  This was the second time Lilia was our server and both times we had horrible service.  The first time we let slide because it was a Friday night and they were doing their local brews so they were slammed.  I just thought she was overwhelmed the first time and I didn't let it bother me.  But to have poor service from the same girl twice in a row is unacceptable.    Overall, the food was excellent, the bartender was more attentive to us than our server, I just wish I could've enjoyed more."}
{"text":"I loveee happy hour at this place. Good beers and the happy hour sushi/appetizers menu is awesome! Brought a friend here who did not like sushi, but had some of the Asian chicken nachos and loved them (they are pretty freakin' fabulous). I haven't had anything here that wasn't awesome."}
{"text":"Irreverent and original, be prepared for some unique interpretations of your asian classics. While there are the traditional sushi and sashimi, there are also fun rolls, usually with a spicy twist.  And then they have the most awesome Asian dessert - \"Mojo's\"!! (ice cream sushi rolls). Be sure to save room!"}
{"text":"If you eat in sushi does still take awhile on occasion. The service is usually decent although not overly friendly either.  They have decent vegan options and I must say the portions are rather large. When we wanted a basic tofu/rice/veggies bowl we started getting take out here rather then Pei Wei or other pseudo asian joints because; it's cheaper, it tastes better and for under $6 you get a large bowl that is plenty for 1.5 meals. I have never even gotten the \"plate\" size because the bowl is always so large.   I usually get the brown rice bowl with fried tofu, add veggies and the curry or chile sauce. Once in awhile I will mix it up and do noodles instead which is good as well.  It's a decent place to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat, sometimes can get busy but it's good to have places like this in the neighborhood (plus it's not a chain - bonus)."}
{"text":"I have never eaten inside the place but I may go for the AYCE thing on a Saturday.   I've ordered take out on a few occasions and really liked it. I am a very judgmental sushi eater! I love unagi and the flavor has to be just right! So the dragon rolls to have impressed me is a big deal. I also ordered the tuna tataki that just wasn't seasoned as well as other places but overall enjoyable. The chicken katsu is very tasty, panko breading makes anything good though, and comes with asian slaw that isn't overly tart  and the brown rice was cooked well. My son loves those desert rolls, the little fatty!   I've ordered by phone and gone in to order and either way the staff has been friendly and helpful.   I like this place and even though I have moved farther from this place than other sushi restaurants I will continue to go there until I am thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a five star because i love the food, verity and ambiance however the young servers are giving consistent poor service. I was there for dinner and we were sat in a semi full restaurant at the back table by the bathroom. When our female server showed up and we asked if we could be moved she seemed irritated and said \"sure\" and walked away. We had to grab our own menus and go ask another server to be relocated. Food was fantastic As always but our new server never cleared our plates and so we kept moving them to the table next to us. When she brought our check we had plates stacked on both tables.  My opinion is that the younger generation providing the service have never really paid or gone out for dinners that they are paying for themselves and are clueless on etiquette, timing and customer service.  They need basic 101 training.  The \"riblets on the menu are amazing!! If you do go, the menu is very entertaining so be sure to take a good read of it!!"}
{"text":"I'll admit I really have never loved this place until now!  Lived down the street since before they opened. They have the best rotating IPA selection in town. IPAs you won't get anywhere else in town. Sushi is great too but combine their beer selection with the food and it's my new local place."}
{"text":"Mediocre to the max with bad service to boot!   I've given this place a handful of tries and I just can't seem to find anything I like. The service is probably the worst part. Waiting 10 minutes for sushi rolls that are clearly ready and waiting to be served is not acceptable. I feel bad for the waitresses - every time I am in they seem to be running around like crazy.    The food is pretty horrible too. I CAN say the Asian chicken salad is pretty good but the rice bowls and sushi are all not good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great happy hour, and Caitlin, Sarah and Jesse are fabulous servers."}
{"text":"The staff was very rude, messed up an order and ignored me or passed off responsibility to several other employees for over 10 minutes while I tried to get someone to fix it. One employee interrupted me several times when I tried to explain what was missing. Ended up leaving with the wrong order."}
{"text":"First don't tell me I can't sit in the booth when no one is in the restaurant. Service was horrible, we ended up walking out."}
{"text":"Moto is one of the few sushi places near DT that I know of...on top of it being centrally located, it also has some pretty damn good sushi!  I have not been too adventurous with the menu...I normally always get the standard (a sake bomber, edamame, a roll, and some sashimi) but my co-diner decided to be gutsy and try  \"The Exit Wound\" is possibly the hottest noodle bowl in the Southwest...so watch out!  After that bowl, cool off with their ice cream sushi...it's two or sometimes three different types of ice cream (it's always a surprise and they won't tell you ahead of time what type of ice cream they are using for the night) and then rolled in rice crispies...definitely yummy.  Two chopsticks up! :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited about Moto, so my Mom and I checked it out.  Bleh.   The sushi was just not good... not like stinky-ew-terrible, but mediocre. Our server was pretty young and confused about the whole serving profession.  I give it two stars because I can see myself cruising to the bar for a midday beer and chowing down on some edamame, as it's a really neat area."}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious and not unreasonably priced. I wouldn't say its the best sushi I've ever had but its definitely quality and the prices, atmosphere and selection definitely mske up for it. The entire restaurant has a sense of humor and the staff is generally pretty friendly.   North central Phoenix also lacks some good bars but Moto's definitely stands out if you're looking to get some drinks as well. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and it's 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"It hits home! I liked the flavor of the pad thai and the spring roll. I thought it was really nice and flavorful. Huge servings and friendly staff. This visit is 5star rated for me."}
{"text":"Surprised that I loved this place.  Haven't been a big sushi fan in the past, but this place may change that.  Plenty of vegan options.  Service was quick, although not personable.  Bathrooms were clean, customers seemed happy, and the ambiance was better than average.  Will definitely try again soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here for a quick drink and appetizer before our nail appointment on a Saturday afternoon. They had friendly staff and happy hour from 11-6:16, so score! I got a Moscow mule and she got a mojito. Both were fresh and delicious! We also got the bún bo edamame (don't try these on a first date) that were covered in a yummy Vietnamese sauce/spices. We also got the spring rolls. We will definitely come back to try more!"}
{"text":"Love this place, we have been coming here almost every 2 weeks. Service is amazing food is great. We got fried spring rolls and our favorite Moto wings. Then we had a big plate of avocado rolls, rainbow, Las Vegas and spicy tuna rolls. And if you have not tried before you should definitely try their ice cream mojos."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for lunch, happy hour, dinner. Long been a fan of the variety of spring rolls and noodle bowls. Also like appys like the riblets and wings.  Good beer selection, though today they have not a single Asian beer available.  An Asian restaurant without Asian beer??? Unthinkable."}
{"text":"We eat at Moto 3-4 times a year.  We've always been happy with the food, service and prices. Our last visit was about 2 weeks ago;  we ordered all 5 rolls on the happy hour menu,  wine and beer.  Service was prompt, the drinks and rolls came lickety split and all was fresh and flavorful.  Leftovers were cheerfully boxed and just as tasty for the next day's lunch.  My favorite part of Moto is that the rolls are a little skinnier than most others and therefore it's easier to eat one entire piece at a time without cutting it or biting in half.  Manageable bite sized pieces.  The dessert roll is always a hit.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour on Sundays. Sushi is pretty good but I didn't like the nachos."}
{"text":"Moto does everything good, but it never rises to great. They have an eclectic menu and there's tons for non-sushi eaters, too. Good value for dollar spent and usually walk away full and happy."}
{"text":"Solid happy hour, 1/2 off rolls and select apps and $3 beers. They extend happy hour until 6:15 and that extra 15 minutes really helps when you are rushing after work.   I liked the spring rolls and the tootsie roll was decent too. The bar is big and we easily found a seat but it tends to fill up fast after 5.  Not the best sushi in the world but the happy hour prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"The sushi was acceptable. The service is awful. We waited 15 min to get menus. Another 10-15 to have our order taken and then it took a good 30 min to get our food. We weren't in a hurry or we would have left. The place had about 20 people inside with 3 servers, so unless the servers were also doing the cooking there is no reason it should have taken this long. The location was far from \"busy\" but that was the excuse used over and over. I would recommend one of the other many sushi restaurants in town. Or perhaps, heading to Fry's on Tatum and Shea. They have better service and better sushi."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good music, relaxing--can be pricey but worth it. Asian nachos are the best--will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome inexpensive happy hour. The food is tasty - not just sushi. Great place to just hang out for awhile."}
{"text":"Not that this place was ever even a 4 star establishment, but even my last review and rating is too good for what I recently experienced. Went for lunch and was \"greeted\" by a yell from some guy behind the bar telling me to sit wherever I wanted to. After my lunch companion arrived we retrieved our own menus and sat down. Again a yell from behind the bar wanting to know if we wanted water to drink. I ordered the panic shrimp x 2 ($4.50 each) and a wonton soup. She ordered the chicken caesar salad. The place had maybe 6 people dining and at least that many employees all congregated behind the bar. Eventually our food came. The shrimp are large shrimp that someone has beaten the hell out of until they are paper thin and then deep fried. They were warm, not hot, and very greasy. The wonton soup was almost tasteless. Watered down chicken broth (most likely from a can) and 3 soggy wontons. The wontons were unseasoned and the texture mealy. I gave up at this point and cut my losses with the disappointing appetizers. I was told the chicken caesar salad was acceptable, but nothing that you couldn't get at any other fast food joint. Overall very disappointing and we will most likely never return."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Moto, but I had been wanting to try it, so I read the Yelp reviews to know what to expect. Pretty much this place gets good reviews for food and dinged on the service. I have to say both were awesome on my visit. My server/bartender was Rebecca and she was knowledgable about the beer and food, as well as friendly. She made suggestions about what to try, but only based on my preferences, and never pushy. I don't eat a lot of sushi but I was very satisfied with my Las Vegas roll. Rebecca did admit that it was only her second day (never would have guessed) so I'm hoping that means the owners are taking action on the previously bad service reviews. I will certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty, the happy hour cocktail was great, and the edamame was perfectly salted. And even though our server was a newbie, she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu Qs.  Unfortunately, none of this matters because I got food poisoning. I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken. Worst 48 hours of my life. I'll never return."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always delicious. I came for lunch today and had Pho which was as good as any Vietnamese place I've gone to. I don't know my waitresses name but she was adorable, extremely nice and attentive. Dinner can get very busy and the wait times can get long, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for happy hour, but this was my first dinner experience. I would say overall for a happy hour meal it's a solid 3 stars. Great deals on beer, and average rolls that'll appease a craving.   The dinner experience is more deserving of 2 stars, but I rounded up. The quality of the food doesn't align with their regular prices.  We ordered Gyoza to start. The skin was soft and steamed but it was the blandest little bugger I've had, and it was slightly cold. I then ordered the Lemongrass Pork and I got really confused. It was supposed to be a noodle dish, but it was 60% iceberg lettuce, the pork was super dry as well. At least what few noodles I had were good and I liked the sauce.  Nick wasn't impressed with his dish either. Too little shrimp, not enough spice. The bartender was such a sweetheart though, and the beers were good. Oh well, sometimes a place is only meant for happy hour visits (shoulder shrug)."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Order the Asian Nachos.  They are so addicting!  Mmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"If you are Coming here because the sushi, go somewhere else. Not much options on the menu and sloppy sushi. What they call specials, it's is a regular option anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and they have been very helpful ( im deaf ) and kind. Once they made a mistake and compensated for that mistake greatly!!  The sushi is excellent! Prices can be a bit on the high side but the great food makes up for it. I highly recommend this restaurant for great sushi ."}
{"text":"i have not been here in a while but when i did go the food was rather good not too expensive at all i would return to this location"}
{"text":"Ordered their Pho and it was good- the flavor was amazing but it had grilled chicken which made it a bit dry.  However, we also had sushi and the squid salad and it was fabulous!!!  Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The people who regularly patronize Moto must not have jobs, or lives, or children, or pets, because if they did, they would constantly be late to everything they did, have a pissed off babysitter, and dead animals littering their house.  I am extremely understanding and very forgiving, but when it takes over 45 minutes to bring me avocado rolls, when it really isn't busy, there is something way wrong. Like wayyyy wrong.  I had the miso soup. Didn't like it. Once I finally got the avocado rolls, they were really good, but I was so annoyed that I could barely enjoy them. I also had to ask several times to get my tea refilled.  The location is good, my sushi was good and reasonably priced, and the decor is pretty cool, so I am going to give them three stars, but the service was so terribly slow I feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient."}
{"text":"Moto is pretty high up there in the sushi world for me. I love my sushi so it take a good place to impress me.   I first went to Moto for their All-You-Can-Eat Saturdays. IN the beginning it wasn't nearly as strict as it is now, but rightfully so they had to implement some rules(Don't be a gluten, no sharing, $0.50 per piece you have leftover that they will box up for you to take home, must eat all the rice as well...). They offer just about any kind of sushi you would want for about $18 per person, or $22 per person if you want Saki with it, still a fab deal!   My other favorite there is their chicken terriacki bowl, probably the best I have had in a long time. They have a \"built your own\" style bowl menu, very good, check it out!   Over all Moto is good, but a once in awhile venture."}
{"text":"Oh Moto how I love  thee!   Let it be known I like sushi, Pad Thai etc but it isn't my go to meal. In other words, it has to be really delicious for me to partake in such foods. I'll tell you...Moto Sushi has incredible food, service, and a chill/inviting vibe. The menu is brilliantly creative with items that will please the biggest sushi fan down to the pickiest of eaters. My favorite menu items are the pad Thai with shrimp, the Asian nachos, and the Moto chicken salad (ahhh I want some now!!). They also have things like chicken wings, quesadillas, noodle dishes, create your own bowl, fried tofu, and lots of other wonderful dishes. The food travels well so it's perfect to pick up and also great for leftovers the next day.   If you dine in you'll notice the service is very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Another perk of dining in is the vast array of their specialty cocktails and small dishes available to you at happy hour (saving money...jackpot)! I haven't actually had a drink here, but they all look quite tasty, so I look forward to doing so. The prices are mid range and reasonable for the portion sizes and quality of food. Every dollar spent at Moto is totally worth it.   Whenever I want good sushi and noodles I head to Moto. They have incredible food, friendly people, and a hip and happening atmosphere. You've got to check this place out, it's the best!"}
{"text":"I love this place and go there like a regular. It is not a typical sushi bar. My gf hates sushi and one side of their menu is dedicated to the \"non sushi\" person. It is a very stylish upscale but not pricey place. All the waitresses are super cool and quite sexy too. I see lots of families there and the regulars really are regular..whether at the bar or table they have a great selection of imported beer. maybe I think of it as a neighborhood sushi place."}
{"text":"I have been here three times, and each time the service was incredibly bad. I thought it might get better, but now I'm too frustrated to return. The sushi is fine and near my house- but I won't be a patron of this place again. Incredibly disappointed. I had to debate with a server about pricing when I ordered off the happy hour menu. Even on my final bill, she did not give me the correct pricing. I saw it and ordered it off the happy hour menu within the happy hour window. I don't understand the confusion. By the time I got the incorrect bill, it was too much effort to push the matter further. I just paid and left feeling totally bummed about what was supposed to be a yummy treat and break from my busy day. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am not much of a sushi fan usually but I thought this place was pretty good. I was really happy that they had more than the typical sapporo, asahi, kirin beers that you find at every sushi place but had a small number of american microbrew beers also.  They have a Saturday lunchtime all you can eat deal for $19 that can't be beat. The only reason I am not giving it 4 or 5 stars is the service wasn't very attentive and the regular prices are a little high."}
{"text":"probably the ONLY place i'm a regular.  have really only had their tofu bowls. i only have lunch here and i never feel like trying anything new.   their bowls are great. choose your \"meat\". the way you want it cooked - i prefer garlic and broccoli. white or brown rice. add veggies for a $1 more.   i dont know if i would recommend any sushi from here. had a spicy tuna once. dont remember it. so it must have not been that good.   they have this dessert thats pretty good."}
{"text":"What?? No raw salmon? Only smoked?I am tres cornfused. Am I at a bagel place or a sushi restaurant?  Slow service. Limited sushi menu. Bland Miso.  NO RAW SALMON.  Enough said, I won't be back. Too bad it was my only Saturday sushi lunch option (Zen 32, I'm looking in your direction...)."}
{"text":"Papa Trans Riblets are to die for! Moist, flavorful, get me a side of rice and ranch dipping sauce and I'm in heaven! If I could eat these for breakfast lunch and dinner I would, we drive 55 miles to eat these bad boys! Hint: order the large size and don't share because seriously even if your full you can still eat more! My mouth is watering now for Papa Trans Riblets! Ok gotta go !"}
{"text":"Love love love the curry soup here  My boyfriend and I love coming here Charity is awesome...she always remembers what we like  Definitely recommend curry soup and bar wings  There's nothing I haven't liked here  Rolls are a good size"}
{"text":"I've been going to Moto ever since they opened. I don't go anywhere else for sushi in Phoenix. They have great specialty rolls and standard rolls and they're very reasonably priced. I also discovered the curry soup there and it's FANTASTIC. The staff is very friendly and on one visit a server I had frequently knew I had a horrible day, and she brought me a glass of wine on the house. I really think this place is exceptional. Great food, great staff, great environment. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good customer service. Saw other reviews that they didnt like customer service. Seems they have changed that! Decent happy hour. Excellent wings....! Good sushi. Very different beer menu!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, I prefer to sit up at the bar counter.  I went there for lunch the other day by myself and it was fast service but there were tons of \"regular\" types in there drinking and chatting up the staff.  It made me wonder why they were just hanging out on a week day in the middle of the afternoon...but they are lucky I guess. Oh the food: I started with miso soup and edamame (both hard to mess up), they were good. I ordered a tempura shrimp roll...it was okay, the end pieces had the parts you don't eat so there were only like four pieces.  Overall it was okay and one of the only sushi places by my office (now that I work nearby) so I'll probably be back.  I'm open to recommendations...but I've definitely been to plentyyyy of better sushi spots.  Ohhh and the parking lot is a nightmare -- whether you're trying to run into Subway or Moto this shopping center is sheer chaos during lunch especially."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I love this place. It is a small dim friendly restaurant. You can enjoy a nice dinner with the family or meeting people by the bar on a night out with the girls. Staff is great. You can find the owner there often meeting people. They all make you feel welcome and wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"Have been to this spot several times. Always recommend it to others However last time I was here I had a very frustrating experience as far as service. The food has always been very pleasant and good. However our waitress served our table appetizers all at different times, martinis in wine glasses (?!) entrees at least 10 minutes apart, then to top it off, my cousin who was visiting me and was off duty from the military had a very bad dish.  After speaking with the general manager about a few of the frustrations throughout our meal, she did comp the food, which was very nice as we did not expect this. I would still recommend this place as it has a very casual ambiance and great dishes however I think the staff is where the fault is and if you don't mind drinking sake out of a plastic cup."}
{"text":"I really like Moto!  I find their sushi a little on the pricey side but everything else seems to be of good value. My favorite thing to get is there a \"bowl\" let's you pick what kind of meat, what kind of vegetable, what type of rice, and what kind of sauce you want to have. Teriyaki and curry are my favorite options. They have good salads and one of my favorite things is their version of a shrimp tacos. Yummy! Lots of good offerings here, with friendly service and nice atmosphere. Plus, it amuses me that they have rules about cell phones ringing and touching their curtains, LOL"}
{"text":"Recently discovered by the Canadians, Moto roughly translated means \"don't eat sushi here, but everything else on the menu is great!\"  My first visit to Moto was several years ago when I had some sushi and sashimi items. My most vivid memory was ordering a Philadelphia roll and watching the sushi guy take an already made roll off the counter and cut it into pieces and serve it to me. I'm sorry, has that been there long?   Flash forward to a month ago when my parents were at Matsuri and wanted a \"Japanese\" meal. I recommended Moto because it was the only place I thought would be open at 2PM on a Saturday. I was drawn to revisit it because they offer some interesting beer selections on draught. Well, they do, and it exposed me to a couple of interesting beers I'd not heard of. My folks wanted to order sushi, so I let them, and sure enough the rolls they ordered, as well as my sashimi selections were just not very good. Everyone at the table ordered entrees and we were all very happy. The build your own noodle bowls are great. I have been back a couple times since and really enjoy it every time.   The service here has been great every visit with a staff of girls all in their twenties that are hip, but not in an asinine way that some of these other types of places can be. Try getting a twenty something girl to show you any respect at Stingray, RA, etc. Ain't gonna happen, friend. I'm also impressed that they offer a great happy hour, especially Sunday when it is all day long.   Yep, Moto is a great place, as long as you don't order the sushi. The menu items are too good to pass up to order something that is sub-par or average."}
{"text":"I love Moto, always quality food. Great sushi, spring rolls, and the rice bowls are awesome. They also added the Pho soup which is excellent!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a variety of Asian food, Moto would not disappoint! I have been here several times and never had a bad meal. Everything from the pho to their custom rice bowls are delicious and very reasonable. The environment is really neat and wait staff is generally very welcoming. Two of my favorite dishes are the grilled chicken pho and the exit wound bowl (which is very spicy, seriously.)  The reason for the 4-Star review is sometimes the wait can be rather slow. Some food items seem to take much longer than others and leaves you waiting, in addition the wait staff can be a bit slow to respond to checks, drinks and other side requests."}
{"text":"Yes, this is worth making a trip for.  The happy hour menu is inexpensive and innovative (try out the Asian nachos), the sushi has been fresh on every visit, and some of the combos on the top-secret underground menu (ok maybe not so secret any more) compare to some of the best sushi I've had on the coast.  The atmosphere is kinda hip and urban. Service is always good. I notice the owner frequently on-site and working, which is a good thing.  After happy hour some of the mixed drinks can get sorta pricey, but not unreasonable.  So yes, check it out."}
{"text":"This place is decent. The prices are alright and the menu has a lot more than just sushi. The service has kind of depended on the time of day I have gone. The lunch service has always been pretty good, the dinner service was pretty slow. We waited 30-40 mins for our sushi order. They were pretty busy, but not THAT busy. It is a pretty small place so it can definitely be a little crowded, but it's a cute little place with good sushi."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here and I didn't write a review the first time because i wasn't that impressed. We wanted to give this place another try because our friends loved it.   I had the Stoner Bowl and was pleasantly surprised. It was absolutely delicious. So a sushi place selling a buffalo chicken, lettuce, ranch and rice bowl.   Yeah, it seemed like something you would eat after a late night of drinking. Very impressed. Huge portion of chicken, just a touch of ranch and white rice that goes perfect. I will be back again. Just shows you that you should always give a place a second chance."}
{"text":"We knew that something was wrong when this place was fairly empty on a Saturday night at 6pm.  First, the menu states if you order something and it's too spicy, tough shit, no returns or exchanges.  Second, the dragon roll price says market price. Seriously, what ingredient in a dragon roll fluctuates so much that it needs to be market price?  Third, the sushi is overpriced and lacks any fish. My rainbow roll had pieces of fish that were about 1-2mm thick.  Fourth, the service was slow. The roll came out about 15 minutes after the person I was with got her pho soup.  Fifth, this place feels like a money grab by the owner who doesn't care about his customers. Menu confirms this attitude. Scroll through the photos."}
{"text":"Thank you for paying attention and cleaning the grates !!"}
{"text":"I'll give 0 stars to the bar wings, PLEASE BRING THE ORIGINAL \"BAR WINGS\" BACK!!!! New recipe is WAYYYY off!!! And bad tasting too!   Other than that a huge improvement in all other items!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But now their happy hour sucks. They took the philly roll off happy hour and the Vegas roll, long story short the \"good stuff\" was eliminated off the happy hour menu. They are already stingy with the rolls as it is (extremely small rolls even smaller pieces of salmon per bite) and on top of that they're not available on happy hour, crazy! I have no problem with paying if it was good sized portions or at least quality fish but nope. Only giving it 3 stars because *some* of the staff is very friendly and the establishment itself is clean and cute. Other than that I'm not sure I'll be back soon and I will think twice before eating here again. Much rather go to Moira sushi in Downtown Phx their happy hour menu is awesome as well as the hours from 5-7pm on weekdays and weekends 9pm to 2 am"}
{"text":"There are so many sushi Happy Hour places around, but wanted give this one a try.  The HH menu sushi selections only has four rolls  (Kalifornia, Philadelphia, Spicy tuna roll, and Tootsie roll).  I had ordered the Kalifornia and Tootsie roll.  You can really tell the experience of the Sushi Chef making the rolls.  The rolls are small, uneven, and about to fall apart.  We had also tried the Asian nacho, edamame, and gyoza. The Asian nacho was not bad.  I guess anything with cheese should blend well, most of time.  The best was the beer.  I think the name was Sweet Betty, can't remember.  I had to order two to enjoy with my sushi.  The service was alright, it could be better."}
{"text":"mmmmm.....moto!  Love this place.  Happy hour specials are awesome, beer selection is great and being harassed by the owner makes every visit complete.  Vince, keep up the good work!  You run one of my all time favorites!"}
{"text":"As you can see we all agree that the food is worthy of 4 starts; but I can ensure you our server kamila made it a 5 star.   Happy hour isn't bad."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow. It seemed like they had maybe 3 people working, and we'd often wait (what felt like) 15 minutes to get any attention, even when I was just standing there waiting to be seated (or greeted, for that matter).  The menu is fairly comprehensive. The food is decent. I wasn't amazingly impressed, but I wasn't disappointed, either. Some of the prices seem steep. The atmosphere is kind of cramped and congested, but it was comfortable. Slightly loud, but you could still hear each other talk.  But considering that I lost my dinner after I got home, I'm okay with not going back. No huge loss here."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not into sushi, but this place is still good for the non-sushi person. This place is right down the street from my office and I have had the buffalo burger (great?), their moto wings are spicy and tasty, their yaki soba noodles are good and so are the sweet potatoe fries.   The wait staff is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Came here after a friend recommended it, and she told me to try the Asian Nachoes---and yes they were amazingly good!!    Vegas Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Dragon roll were all so very yummy!  Washed it all down with two glasses of Sapporo:)    The only thing i have to complain about is our server--she wasn't very nice and forgot our napkins when we asked for them a second time...but other than that good experience.    The location is easy to find--still in central phx.    Go during happy hour 4-6:15, half of selected sushi rolls and two bucks of beer.  Good appetizers as well.  Saturdays they have all you can eat sushi for 18 bucks from 11-2:30...not sure if i will do that, but never know."}
{"text":"The food is great most of the time. I feel like they have all new staff every time I go there. They are always showing FOX News Channel on multiple TVs, so that's a bit of a turn off. But yeah, the food is decent!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter there for her 14th birthday on 12/17 and it was the worst service I have had in a long time. The waitress brought my food first and then my daughters sushi. If she was a good waitress she should have waited to put in my order so both orders came to the table together. It was 15 minutes before the \"Birthday Girl\" received her dinner. The sad part about this whole ordeal was she \"chose\" this restaurant for her birthday dinner. We were both so upset that we wanted to leave and  not tip the waitress. Unless the owners hire or train the waitresses better, we won't be back or refer this restaurant again. I see several bad reviews regarding service from months ago and yet here we are with terrible service. Doesn't say much about the owners or management. They really need to read all the reviews!!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant!  I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good.  Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing.  During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it.  Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Go there for lunch often and I'm treated like Norm at Cheers. Love they remember my name. The servers and sushi chefs ( especially Ivan) can cut and roll some sushi! They have an underground menu you can pick from or just tell Ivan what you want in your roll ( custom)! I order the \"Sasquatch\" roll and I'm thoroughly satisfied. The noodles and any of the bowls there rival any sushi place around. They change out their beers weekly so you can enjoy many local brews. Try the \"stoner\" bowl and enjoy the spicy chicken/ ranch/ rice mix. Great for a hangover. It's local, its comfortable and it has a great happy hour on Friday."}
{"text":"Saturday: 11am-2:30: all you can eat sushi is only $16.95  pretty darn good sushi too.  not busy, you get a seat easily.  Nice but not a scene-- which is how I like to dine on sushi.  I have had better but at this price, this is as good as it will ever get!    I've only had sushi here, so I don't know what the other food is like, but the other tables had non-sushi meals and they looked good, big portions.    www.mrmotorising.com"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Moto... It's on my way home from work so it's an easy stop for takeout.  I've dined in a well.   I typically get the Beef Pho, extra beef and usually a small Papa Tran Riblets appetizer. When done right both are delicious. I love these riblets, they are addictive and are coated in salt and pepper and chili flakes. They are served dry and very addictive if you like a little heat you can't eat just one!   My beef with Moto is consistency, both on food and service.  I got takeout last night and the Pho was very good but the riblets just didn't have their normal coating of seasoning and it's the heat I really like. Don't get me wrong they were still good, but just not the same.  This is not an isolated incident it's happened several times where something is just off and also more than once they have actually left a whole dish or a component out of my order forcing me to return. It didn't happen last night because I've learned to double check.   When done right these two items are both very very good. I just wish they would be done right more often as you just never know here.  That said it's convenient and I keep going back because like I said when it's good when it's good.   Mojo's their version of an ice cream sushi rolled in Rice Krispie treats. Well you will have thought you died and went to heaven.  Super delicious.  You never know what flavor you are getting.   I've never had their sushi but I've dined in and had the Pad Thai which was also good.  Three stars for inconsistency of food preparation and service for pretty regularly leaving something out of a takeout order."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The nachos are KILLER GOOD!!!!! Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Mutt-friendly microbrews - oh yea.  Hiking with Jaek recently one evening was culminated wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio.  Sure it was warm, but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer.  Beautiful, man, beautiful."}
{"text":"AWKWARD as attending your ex husbands wedding to your former best friend...best way to sum up tonight's dinner at Moto.  Let me start with saying, I love Moto, come often, Charity and another server, tall, dark hair, black rimmed glasses, tattoos (mad at myself I can't recall his name right now) are amazing. Know the menu, attentive and personable without being fake and obnoxious. I honestly will wait for a table in their section rather than risk not having the experience I've become custom to. Tonight...I will keep it as brief as I can. - gentleman who sat us was literally dripping in sweat. It's July, it's miserable I get it. It was not really getting my appetite going watching him drip all over our menus clearly frazzled. - the restaurant was clearly way busier than anyone expected given its summer and 7 pm on a Thursday. They were understaffed, but hey, it's summer in AZ. Things slow down.  - the ONLY people who appeared frazzled and annoyed the restaurant was busy...was the swamp monster who sat us (assuming some sort of lead / management position and a man in a purple polo. The servers and the ONLY sushi chef seemed to be on point and not showing the customers any sort of panic.  Let's talk about purple polo. It was unclear if he was a off duty Moto fun police officer. Customer who self appointed himself as the boss. Or just an unhappy man on a mission to ruin everyone's night. He spent 85% of his time sitting at the bar socializing with what appeared to be regulars, and the 15% terrorizing the staff with his overly anxious approach.  He actually felt it was necessary and appropriate to pull out server outside right in front of the CLEAR glass door for everyone to to see him, what appeared to be grilling her. Regardless if it was a slap on the wrist or a celebration of her great service. Not appropriate, and unprofessional. The restaurant was packed and she was clearly capable of handling her tables...well until he removed her to publicly humiliate her. It was unprofessional and a poor example of what I assume would be management? Save it for off hours. Oh, and maybe not chill at the bar while your understaffed restaurant busts their asses and then ridicule and undermine them in front of their customers. Normally, I would give 5 stars to Moto. My husband and I left dinner from one of our favorite places disgusted and mortified by the stranger in the purple polos' strange and unprofessional behavior. I hope he reads this review and feels ashamed and apologizes to his hard working staff."}
{"text":"If ever a great neighborhood bar existed, this is the place.  The dedication to an atmosphere that stays hip, knows its customers, and evolves to capture your heart and palette remains the core of this perennial hit year after year.    From the great happyhour, to the ribs on sundays, to the new addition of vietnamese cusine there is nothing on the menu that isn't ready to bring a smile to your face.  Every time my friends can't decide where to go, I respond, Moto!  Everyone finds a dish or sushi roll that fits their mood and a brew that compliments the moment.  That alone gets them 4 stars, the 5th star is reserved for having one of the best desserts in town, the Mojo....ice cream sushi....."}
{"text":"Just left this place after ordering sushi and waiting 1hr20min and left hungry. Food never came with Slow Hand Jack at the sushi bar...tho orders put in after ours were filled. We were given a table meant for 2 and squeezed our threesome in. And to top it off, we were still charged full price for our drinks and soup. LAME! Hana's on 7th Ave is the place to be! Take heed!!!"}
{"text":"Two words for you- caramel wings. They are the best wings I've ever had, and I'm one of those girls who doesn't eat wings in public, but one whiff of the Caramel garlic goodness and I inhaled half my friend's order. Love. Also, Moto sports a rockin beer lineup which is almost unheard of in a sushi joint-they have happy hour every day of the week! The sushi was good, I'm a huge fan of the bowls myself. And every single time I've been there (a dozen? More?) I've had stellar service. Super awesome staff, lovely ambience, awesome food and beer!! Go to moto, you will love it!"}
{"text":"I really wish I liked this place more. It's hip! It's modern! It's kind of edgy! And I love sushi!  But every time I go I leave feeling a little disappointed with my meal. The sushi is only ok. And I can't seem to find anything else on the menu that I like. Soup is bland, BBQ pork was ok but not great, spring rolls nothing to write home about.  I'll go here if someone else wants to and just deal, but I'll won't  choose to go on my own."}
{"text":"Worst pho I have ever had!! Rubbery beef, crunchy noodles and tasteless broth.... Look else where for Pho!!!"}
{"text":"So, the closing time says 9ish. We walked in at 830pm and asked if they were still open. The hostess said yes and seated us. As soon as we sat down the server came over and said since it was 830 there were certain rolls we couldn't order. We told her what we wanted since we already knew and she agreed that we could order those rolls. As we were waiting they started putting up the chairs on the tables around us. Then she walked out with our sushi that looked very sloppily put together and also put our check down at the same time. At this point we felt extremely rushed and annoyed. I wish when we walked in she would have said they were closing, then we wouldn't have even bothered. So, we got mediocre sushi and were rushed out. We both felt annoyed about the entire experience.  Usually its pretty decent, I would say excellent or good, just decent and this time it wasn't even that. Might be a while before we give it another chance."}
{"text":"this place has awesome sushi. get the tootsie roll or one of the spicy bowls. the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I always have a good time when I dine in though I tend to get it to go because I live around the corner!  Good Spring rolls and my wife loves the sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from me and have been here several fans. Anyone who know me, knows I`m a sushi whore so why write about non sushi items you ask? Well I was more impressed with the non sushi items! Don`t get me wrong, sushi is ok here but I have had better elsewhere.  What I did enjoy was the trying the Exit Wound bowl. Super spicy crispy shrimp, chicken and veggies was delicious! Maybe being winter, this was a perfect choice for something that warmed me up and boy it sure did! I am curious about the Classified bowl which is rated a 6 fire on the hot scale, and says on the menu: Do Not Order!!) My Exit Wound bowl was rated a 4 fire!"}
{"text":"OK - I'll be honest... I LOVE their food (especially the sushi).  But their service can be REALLY bad.  I've had to re-order drinks multiple times, wait long times for a check at the table...  and most recently I tried to place a pick up order over the phone.    I asked to pick up my food in 1 hour, they asked why I was calling so far in advance... I explained that I was going to be in a meeting and couldn't call back in 30 minutes to place the order.  Their response was that they would have it ready in 20 minutes, but I didn't want my sushi sitting for another 40 minutes before I picked it up.  They said they couldn't guarantee to have it ready in an hour.  SERIOUSLY?  You're kidding, right?  So, I hung up and won't be doing that again.  I also cancelled my plans with a group of 14 friends to have dinner there this weekend... we're going to Stingray instead.    I've lost my patience with Moto.  Yea, the food is good - but the service is just so ridiculously bad..."}
{"text":"I visit Moto's at least once a month. I usually come after one of a business group's membership meetings.  Our group has even used Moto's to have quick board meetings.  When I show up at 4:30 I'm still on my workday and use my computer and headset on my phone and take a table away from others.  This was the first time I found the service less than. Was told by waitress I was rude because I was on the phone. And when I asked for water I was brought a bill.  The busboy then started to clear the table with wine still in my glass before I even got up.  I think I'll be finding a new place to go to after our meetings and will find a new place for our members to have a quick impromptu meetings. #BadService #BadVibe #FoodWasNeverGreat  This is the first bad review I have ever left, check my others."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Happy hour prices are up but quality has gone down. They used to have satisfactory drinks but now they're extremely watered down. And when I complained the manager said some bull and said she couldn't take it off the bill. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Love the place and the servers but PLEASE stop with the 'fifty's' look?  What would be appealing about a cool neighborhood bar that has the poor staff wearing gas station shirts and headbands.  Really.  These are wonderful people being dressed like they are 50 years old and looking silly.  I'm not the only person that says this. I just took the time to say it. Please. Please, something modern.  We won't bring friends here from out of town because it looks so dated.  (Not the servers themselves - love them.) But the silly outfits they are forced to wear."}
{"text":"I don't go to Moto very often, even though it's across the street from my  house.  I've really only been for dinner and take out.  It's been good, standard fare.  Nothing spectacular, but good.  The fish has been better than some places.  And the AYCE sushi special on Saturdays for $15.95 is a great deal.  Today I went to lunch with a PG girlfriend, so, no raw fish for her.  We decided to share two dishes, the sweet & sour shrimp and the veggie pad thai.  While the serving of pad thai was huge, I thought that $8.95 for no meat was a little steep, it's $12.95 to add chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu.  And the shrimp bowl was good, the sauce was tasty and not too sweet, but only 5 pieces of shrimp.  Not a value.  Since they don't have a lunch menu, I think I'll stick to Moto for happy hour and for dinner and AYCE on Saturdays."}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood, and I LOVE this place. In fact, I should probably give it 5 stars, but I haven't had the sushi there yet. I always get a rice bowl, and the crispy tofu is delicious! I've also had the salmon, and I thought the flavor was great, but the portion was a little small. My favorite thing on the menu is the red curry crab bisque soup, which is out of this world! (I just wish they had a smaller portion that wasn't $5 because I feel like I end up buying 2 dinners).  We tried the rice krispies rolled in ice cream for dessert, and I didn't think that was all that great - it sounds better on the menu than it actually is. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazingly delicious, super fresh, and there are a wide variety of choices. Miso soup is also quite nice as are the gyoza dumplings. This small (ish) place was hopping on a Friday night and we were happy to have reservations for our party of eight. We arrived about a half-hour early prepared to have a drink from the bar and wait for our 6:30 reservation. The hostess was not happy about this. I'm not sure why since we spent plenty of money at the bar AND we sat outside in the late afternoon summer heat. But her displeasure continued when she sat us as well. If the first person you meet in a restaurant is not friendly and welcoming, it sets a bad tone. Our wait staff was efficient and friendly however, and all was quite tasty. We'll revisit Moto because of the food and service, certainly not from the less than welcoming vibe upon entry."}
{"text":"Great beers, delicious food, awesome service. I love this place! The atmosphere is fun and everyone is great. I had the calamari, spring rolls, seaweed salad, and sweet potato fries. Everything was top notch."}
{"text":"Our second time here.  Be warned that Saturday afternoons are busy, they offer an all you can eat sushi deal.  We were not impressed by the sushi last time we were here, so that wasn't an objective.  Instead, we had crispy fried gyozo and tacos, both shrimp and BBQ pork.  The fried dumplings were excellent, I think they were deep-fried as they were crispy all around, I'm not sure you can do that with a skillet, and I have no problem with that.  The dipping sauce was decent but not exceptional.  The tacos were great, I loved my BBQ beef and my wife liked the shrimp.  Two tacos per plate made an excellent late lunch, very good portion size to be full but not stuffed.  I do have to take exception to their guacamole.  I fully understand that they're going for an Asian, not Mexican, vibe for their guac, but it needed seasoning.  I'm not sure what, but I found the flavor kind of flat.  My wife thought it had enough salt, it just needed something to kick up the flavor a little.  Also, the wonton chips for scooping it?  Their strength is not up to the weight of the guac.  We had the Mojo's for dessert, basically it's an ice cream sushi roll.  The ice cream flavor can vary day-to-day, today it was strawberry.  The two pieces that we got were an excellent cap to good food.  Service was not good.  We had to flag down our server for refills for our tea, for a box for the fries to take home for our poodle, for the check.  They were kinda busy, still, it's what they're paid and tipped for.  And finally, and sadly, whatever it was that I was smelling six months ago was still there.  I'm still not sure whether it's cleaning products or sushi, but it was something that really didn't sit well with my nose.  Still, we liked the food and will definitely consider them for future eats."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go out to dinner Friday night, because I hadn't seen my honey in a week and a half. And what better than sushi and a saki bomber to ease back into each other?  We arrived at 8:50 p.m. and were seated almost immediately. In the back. Trying to review our menus in the near darkness wasn't easy. Ten minutes pass as tables around us get hovering attention. We, however, weren't even offered drinks. Just when I was calling Hana to see how late they were serving, someone finally came up to us for our drink order and appetizers. Our soup and appetizer came before our drinks. The Duece was our main course and mediocre at best. I'm used to my sushi/sashimi being a little cooler than room temp.  I echo the comments about a limited menu.  Sorry, but I wasn't impressed. That doesn't mean I won't try again...but I don't see myself waiting another 10 minutes while those around me are being serviced."}
{"text":"Well, it dropped a star for me, and I'll tell you why. Eaten there probably 20 time in the last quarter. I've had it all; All you can eat sushi, bowls, desert, beer. Ate alone, ate with Sandra K, ate with son and family (including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks) had a party of 12 there.  Service....slow on Saturday for the AYES, otherwise I can't complain. There are some \"bright\" spots. First, it's close to my neighborhood, a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non-sushi lovers with you. The bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like. Funny names to them as well, like the \"Exit Wound Bowl\" or \"The Classified Bowl with this description;Don't Order this Bowl\".  Squid Salad is great, great, great! Calamari, ok. Hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool. And their dessert sushis are very unique.  As for the sushi....I now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business. Sushi has become really \"hip\" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people, let's face it, are pulling back. This is not a place for a sushi purist, but give me good food, a cool gathering place (close to my central Phoenix abode) and I will be there. Sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and \"earn\" my business."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend today. I had remember reading about the Asian nachos on Yelp and we ordered the small, without chicken. They were so YUMMY! Definitely something I would go back for. My friend and I were both pretty hungry and we polished off the small with no problem between the two of us.   She ordered the Pad Thai Noodles and I opted for the California roll, with the real crab meat for the $1 up-charge. My friend said her dish was okay but she left a lot on her plate, though it was a huge portion. My Cali roll was pretty good, but kind of dry. I don't  think I've ever left a piece of sushi on my plate and I actually did this time around. I wasn't overly full either though so I think it just wasn't that great. It was a pretty large roll, 8 pieces, and each piece required two bites rather than the normal one piece, one bite.   Service was pretty good. Our waitress kept our glasses full but disappear when we were waiting to pay. She also charged the wrong credit card for each of our tabs but corrected it, hopefully.   Overall, I'd definitely go back for those nachos and to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Moto is a great spot for an inexpensive full service lunch with a fair selection.  People are dogging the sushi, but its pretty good, especially for a place that isn't exclusively sushi.  My only gripe is their light beer selection is limited to Bud Light - everything else is IPA or Asian beer.  what's better than a Coors Light with Asian food?!  Nothing."}
