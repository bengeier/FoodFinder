{"text":"Great food! The atmosphere used to be after work crowd, now its young rowdy folks. Can't hang out there anymore because of it, but I stop by to order food to go, and to have a quick drink while waiting on it."}
{"text":"Love the $3.00 tall draft beers.  But wings are the smallest wings you will ever see and inconsistent service and taste of their wings. Not enough sauce on the wings ever. I'll probably go for the beers.... but won't order the food anymore."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in the area - not over priced. They have pool tables and a juke box. Drinks are made correctly as ordered the first time and they don't up sell you the crap you don't want. This is my \"hole in the wall\" bar. I would pick this place before all others in the area. The crowd is always decent too, everyone just having a good time."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I don't frequent bars and I don't drink either. Why am I reviewing a bar....? good question..  Well, first of all I would like to point out that it's called Wings.. I like wings. I really like wings. In fact I would go so far as to say that I LOVE wings! So how could I not? To be honest though I was tempted to order a burger instead of wings just to be whacky like that. I'm glad I didn't. The wings were pretty good.  Now they weren't the best wings I've ever had but definitely not the worst. They were nice and crispy, not too small but also not jumbo. I also \"borrowed\" some buffalo fries from a buddy that was with me and those things are delicious. Seriously. Loved those. There's also two pool tables that are $1 a game. 
I think if they are ballsy enough to call themselves \"Wings\" they should  differentiate themselves from other bars when it comes to wings. At least make up a couple signature \"house made\" sauces that are really different or jumbo wings. Or both. Or maybe even get a smoker and offer smoked wings. That's different. And weird. And kinda cool. 
Overall not a bad place. Unfortunately what helped them get higher than three stars wasn't their wings but the great buffalo fries and cheap pool tables."}
{"text":"Cheap with cheap beers...with not great food....At least it's clean but the menu needs help...
Just sayin'"}
{"text":"The bomb wings and frozen lime margaritas! Fried shrimp is delicious too. Heads up : some may characterize it as a hole in the wall/ dive bar kind of place, so if you are too upscale you may not be comfortable. But the staff rocks and the food is the truth!"}
