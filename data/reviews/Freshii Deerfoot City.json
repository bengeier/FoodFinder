{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I did not appreciate biting into a piece of chicken. Careless with ingredients. a definite cross contamination issues at this location."}
{"text":"I prefer this freshii location over the one in Sunridge mall. The bowls and salads are loaded and the quality of the ingredients has been great every time I have ordered."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here for the first time.  Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed.  My Pangea bowl was lukewarm at best, every surface was dirty (not really my idea of FRESH) and the staff was blasting very loud Bhangra music which seemed incongruous  for the type of place it is.  (And I'm Indian!)"}
