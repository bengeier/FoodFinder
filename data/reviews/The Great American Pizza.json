{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy the Chicago style pizza with pepperoni. Its difficult to find good Chicago style pizza. Best pizza joint in Brunswick."}
{"text":"My husband and I are fairly new to Brunswick, so we're still trying to sample all of the numerous pizza joints around. I saw that GAPCO was pretty highly rated, and they have a buy one get one half off deal. 

I understand that they have quite a few specialty items, but I was surprised when they quoted me 45 minutes for a PICK-UP order at about 7:30 on a Friday. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations, but I've never waited more than 20 at other pizza places. I can't remember the names of the pizzas we got, but it was a BBQ chicken and a hawaiian. They both tasted pretty good, but the toppings were literally just placed on top of the pizza, so they were falling off left and right every time I tried to take a bite. I would be willing to give it another shot to see if it was a fluke, but it won't be anytime soon since we've had better experiences at places a little closer to SE Brunswick."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering here. We got a simple deep dish Chicago style pizza with pepperoni and onion and got it delivered. When it arrived the pizza was not hot at all, not cold but barely luke warm. First bite into it and all u can taste was raw dough. I've never had a pizza like this before. When we called to explain the situation the girl on the phone basically accused of us lying and was very rude. I'm disappointed because we are new to the area and was excited to try this but I will never order from here again. If you want cold raw pizza with horrible customer service this is your place but I would HIGHLY recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Exterior isn't super inviting, its just a small old plaza storefront, however interior was CLEAN, beautifully decorated, and trustworthy.  The pizza was excellent, thick cheese. (Usually you have to pay more money for this much cheese).  And the staff was very friendly.  Quality Pizza, Quality Service, Quality Decor."}
{"text":"So I use yelp all the time, as I have for a couple years. I read review and comments on restaurants, venues, ect.., but this is the first time I've actually bothered to sit and write a review myself. Amazing!! The cheeses were very fresh quality cheese. And if you love cheese, you'll appreciate it greatly! We got the Green Bay pizza and added pepperoni to it, outstanding! And the Orlando; Very good as well."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food! We had a plain with extra cheese. It was super cheesy and crust was good. Kids liked it. Then...we also had a Reuben stromboli ( seasonal ) that was super awesome. On time with our order. Price is fair."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and subs!  My favorite is the North Carolina and the New York sub.  We had an issue with a pizza being over cooked and I sent an email to the owner who apologized and gave us a free pizza. Great customer service! Pizza has the perfect sauce and a ton of cheese.  You can't go wrong with buy one get one half price!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite pizza place in Brunswick. But please check out their menu. They have a wide variety of food, in addition to several kinds of pizza. Their regular pizza is great. They're always courteous, even when I can tell they're busy, and I've only had one order that didn't look perfect, but the taste was still great. Prices aren't bad either. We became regulars after our first order."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a bit far from where I live so they don't deliver and it's about a 20 minute drive but it's TOTALLY worth it. I love pizza, and I've tried pretty much every pizza place in my area. I'm so glad I took a chance on this place. Their Cleveland pizza has ricotta cheese on it (which is why I tried it) and man, was it good. I've also never heard of Denver style pizza, so I HAD TO try one and wow, it's good. It's huge, and I wish they had some sort of butter dipping sauce for the crust. Bottom line, their pizza is awesome and I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday 2nd time I been here staff is great signs around shop are to my liking I love them a lot but pizza is the best in Brunswick  I tryed  almost all small mom and pop places only no chain I want real pizza me and my wife do one tank trips to try new pizza hands down this place rocks"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here more and more lately. The pizza is exactly the style we like. Cheesy, with a good crust and the dough not too thick. It's buy one get one 1/2 off. So, it's not a great deal for just one pizza but, two or more is SO worth it. This is the kind of pizza that tastes almost as good warmed up in the oven as it does fresh."}
{"text":"I ordered two 1/2 sheet pizzas tonight One was the Cleveland and the other one is the Philadelphia and 25 wings it cost me $66 the Cleveland was pretty good little too much sauce for me and the Philadelphia needed more sauce little dry for me the wings were pretty good I'll have to try them again"}
{"text":"I loved this place but one day I got \"cinnamon\" bites but ended up POISONED with salt. When I called back, I was laughed at. I wrote the owner and she called me a lier. These are HORRIBLE people!"}
{"text":"We've ordered GapCo a couple of times since we've been in Brunswick and have always been satisfied. Gotta say...the Chicago deep dish is totally legit. My sister in law lived on the north side of Chicago for about 15 years and we would visit at least 3-4 times a year and I've sampled Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, and Gino's East and this pizza is right on par. The sauce is a perfect mix of salty and sweet and the cheese and crust thickness is perfect for my liking. We ordered a Chicago pepperoni and onion and the amount and quality of the toppings were perfect. We also ordered spicy garlic wings and hush puppies. The wings kinda sucked and the hush puppies are serviceable to get your hush puppy fix. The wings were soggy and had barely enough sauce on them. The hush puppies are nothing like you will find down south but the flavor is good enough. All in all we will definitely order from here again...especially when we want Chicago deep dish. Way to represent GapCo! (4 stars are for the deep dish only)"}
{"text":"Ordered a deep dish on the phone and they brought me a regular pizza, I call to ask for a credit (not a free pizza) due to their error and they offer me a free can of pop? And to be clear this was the manager too- great customer service! Made me feel like it was my mistake or if I lied? Never ordering from there again

Update!! They made it right (the owner):) just thought I would update this since I spoke to him today and let him know what happened. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered this for the first time and I was very impressed.. the pizza tasted amazing,  especially the Philly pizza.....also ordered a small cheesy bread and it was just the right amount for 3of us and tasted just as great!! Plus there was a buy one get one half off"}
{"text":"This place is great! Their dough and sauce are house made you can totally tell. I'm a fan of the sweet sauce. I also love the variety of specialty pizzas they have. The stuffed crust is awesome, the veggie pizza is great and I love the thin crust too. Their wings, both bone in, and boneless are also delicious. 
This is our go to place for pizza in Brunswick. The buy one get one half off is a great deal. 

Just a tip though if you get the thin crust I suggest picking it up yourself because I've gotten pizzas that weren't crispy by the time they delivered it. 

Otherwise, I love this place and wish it a long future in Brunswick."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Great American Pizza & I'll definitely go back. The Chicago deep dish is spot on. I used to live in Chicago and this pizza would give Lou Malnatis a run for their money. Great chunky mildly sweet tomato sauce with the perfect amount of toppings and cheese. They have perfected the famous buttery thick crust surrounding all of the tomato and cheese goodness!
We also got a St. Louis style pizza. This one was a miss for me. I'm from St. Louis and grew up with the crispy cracker like crust.....Great American Pizza's St. Louis style was pretty much just what everyone would consider a thin crust. It didn't have the famous crispy crust that St. Louis style is known for. Their crust was much softer and thicker than what it should have been for a St. Louis style pizza. Having said that, the pizza was still good. Delicious sauce and the perfect amount of cheese. I really enjoyed both pizzas and look forward to trying more and more from there!"}
{"text":"With all the pizza places in the area, Great American Pizza is my favorite. Pizza's are generally good, the sandwiches need some improvement. Ordered two subs and fries last night. Not a complicated order, but the girl taking it seemed to have trouble. For example, when she read back the order, she only said the one sandwich. Had to clarify she got BOTH sandwiches and 2 fries. Told pick up would be 25 minutes. I came in 20, and my order was sitting on the wire shelves waiting. 

Opened the bag and two plastic containers of fries were sitting on top. The containers were so hot at some point, the plastic containers were fused together! Needed a knife to cut the plastic to separate them. 

The sandwiches were a soggy mess. (I will upload a pic of my meatball sandwich) It was like they were stepped on. No way could you pick it up to eat. Too soggy and limp. Knife and fork was the only option. The reason I gave this review 3 stars is because the mess actually tasted good (I was Hungry!)

UPDATE: Since this original posting, management from GAPCo reached out to me wishing to make things right. That is exemplary customer service! They have since changed containers for the sandwiches and fries. I am very impressed that they want customers to have a great experience! Thank you, Amber for your willingness to make things right! :-)"}
{"text":"First off, its thin crust.  The sauce is pretty good.  They could use a little more sauce.  They have an unlimited medium and x-large deal.  The pepperoni, sausage, onion, and green pepper is very good.  For brunswick its groumet, better than most.  I have picked up the pizza every time, so I have no idea on the delivery service."}
{"text":"Best pizza and best wings in the area with great prices. Can easily feed a family for under $20 and still have quality food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza! Me and my family have ordered several times and have been completely satisfied every time! From the Chicago deep dish, to cheese sticks, and calzones everything was mouth watering! The sauce was outstanding which I believe is the most important part of a great pizza! We never had to wait a ridiculous amount of time and you can taste the quality of the ingredients! The staff was kind and the location is easy to find. I recommend this place to everyone especially those pizza fanatics such as myself! I remember the first time we ordered and I was completely in shock of how good it was! I can't wait to order it again! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't even get thru the phone ordering process. Put on hold for 5 minutes, then constantly interrupted. He did not know what the daily special was. After looking it up, he said it did not apply to specialty as the website suggested. I hung up. Try elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno... This must be the \"delivery\" pizza that this famous tag line is referencing. I never understood that commercial, because \"delivery\" pizza ALWAYS tastes better, but Great Amercian Pizza Co. does pretty much tastes like DiGiorno. 

I didn't get anything over the top, just a basic pepperoni pizza and a basic sausage pizza. Neither were very good. Crust is doughy and a little chewy, but not in a good way; in the DiGiorno kind of way. Same with the sauce. Bland DiGiorno sauce. 

I don't have an axe to grind. The service was friendly, and I was so hoping this pizza would be on par with the many other surrounding pizza joints that offer an excellent variety of good pizzas, but it wasn't. A lot of reviewers like it, so more power to 'em, but as for me, GAPO is a \"never again.\""}
{"text":"Three out of four times that I have had food delivered from here the order was wrong the food is not good enough to go through all that trouble.  Never again. Too many good pizza places in brunswick"}
{"text":"They are right next door to me, and I eat there often.  Of course, their pizza is fantastic, but there is a little known secret.  (they make great salad!  and chicken, and fried shrimp)
the Buy one get one half off is a winner.  My kids love when I bring the pizza home.  Oh yes, they also LOVE the garlic bites!"}
{"text":"I grew up on the South Side of Chicago and lived there until I was 23 when I followed my wife back to her hometown of Cleveland.  I adjusted to the Browns and Indians from the Bears and Sox and I was able to find reliable (and cheaper) substitutes for just about every Chi-Town thing in the CLE except two things - #1) no NHL franchise (please get rid of the annoying Cavs and get hockey, would so much more fit the blue-collar demeanor of CLE) and #2) PIZZA - specifically deep dish.  Had Geracis - okay.  Mama Santas - what's the big deal?  Deweys - hipster.  Someone finally tipped me off to this ma and pa joint in Brunswick of all places.  Having some time on a summer afternoon I drove from the east side out here to give the Chicago deep dish a go (the trophies they have won for sauce gave the drive an impetus).  When I got the pizza from \"Ma\" I told her my pedigree - having been raised on Giordanos, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's (if you know Chicago, you know what I mean).  She said they regularly go to Chicago and they know what Chicago pizza is supposed to be.  So I got my medium Chicago-style deep dish sausage and pepp and headed out with it (not a sit down joint which actually may be a good indicator).  I sat down with it and opened the box.  It looked right and smelled right.  It clearly needed to be devoured with a knife and fork (good sign).  So I picked one up and finally realized that the Holy Grail had been found.  The cheese was right (inch thick).  The sauce was good (not too sweet, not too spicy and on top of the pie).  The pepp was good - not greasy.  My only criticisms - think the sausage could use more fennel (but I grew up with that I know many don't appreciate it as much) and the crust on the bottom of the pie could be a bit thicker (the edge was perfect).  Minor criticisms after trying multiple pizzas around town.  Only knock - I'm an East Sider - but I will take an occasional 40 minute drive to Brunswick over the 5 1/2 hour drive to Chi-Town or the packed in dry ice shipment from Lou Malnati's (which aint the same anyway).  Thanks Great American Pizza Co.  Someone in the CLE finally figured out how to cook a Chicago style pizza.  Now can we work on the NHL so I can see my beloved (and champion - sorry CLE) Blackhawks?  GO BEARS!"}
{"text":"Greasy food, order was wrong, delivery guy crabby and didn't talk. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"We ordered from here  again-my wife loves the Louisville Speciality pizza(not everyone does a chicken bacon ranch cheese pizza well, and this place does it great!).  This time it was delivered exactly as we ordered it-and they got the thin crust right!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza ($27.00) and was told it would ve to me in 45 minutes. It took about an hour and a half and was so cold when it got ro me that i had to recut the pie.

I called and spoke to a manager. He gave me $5 off if I ordered in the next 30 days. 

$5 off a $27.00 pizza? No thanks."}
{"text":"Favorite place to order pizza. We love the speciality pizzas. My favorites are the Louisville, buffalo chicken, bismarck, Cleveland and Las Vegas. I order from here every time I get a chance."}
{"text":"OH WOW! For those of you who don't know me, I am a pizza fanatic. Pizza all day every day forever. I love plain pizzas, specialty pizzas, small pizzas, sheet pizzas, deep dish pizzas, calzones, (which isn't really pizza but is pizza adjacent) and all other pizzas in between. You know who has all of the above? The Great American Pizza Co., that's who. 

I've never been overly picky about my pizza, but I can definitely appreciate an amazing one when I find it. This place has some of the best in the business. I don't say that lightly people. My boyfriend and I just happened to stumble across the name somewhere, and with him also being an avid pizza consumer, we had to try it out THAT DAY. I mean, it has \"great\" and \"American\" in the title, so it had to be amazing. They have pizzas inspired by different cities as specialties. I found that to be pretty cool and unique. 

We may have over done it a bit with the ordering, but with a BOGO  1/2 off sale, who can resist?! So we ordered the Bismarck, which has spaghetti and meatballs on it. Yes, you heard me correctly...ON the pizza. For our half off, we ordered the Key west with spinach, tomato and garlic. Then we, of course, had to order a deep dish pizza. Now, seeing as though we have indulged in real Chicago deep dishes before, we were skeptical. However, I can tell you that The GAPC rivals that of any Chicago one we've tasted. I realize that what I just said is crossing in to dangerous territory, so I'll elaborate. Of course Chicago's pizza is superior. I'm just saying that in Ohio, you can get supremely awesome deep dish without driving 5hours right here in little Brunswick. Man, is it good! 

I have always prided myself on being able to consume mass quantities of pizza in one sitting, but after one deep dish slice and one Bismarck, I was pretty full. Those are some heavy, albeit delicious, pizzas. I was slightly disappointed in the Key West until the next day, when I ate it cold. That makes a damn good cold pizza. There are so many to choose from and you bet your ass we'll be trying them all!"}
{"text":"First off I think the Pizza here is very good, the service though, not so much. Ordered a Chicago on Friday evening, they said it would be 40 minutes.  I walked in at 40 and paid watching the oven for my pie to come out.  Then I watched as they were making pizzas in the back and hey, they were making one just like I ordered.  Turned  out to be mine.  I waited 30 more minutes until it was done.  No one was in charge, and no one was taking care of me or anyone else in the lobby.  The first time I had this, it took 15 minutes more than when I called but the girl kept assuring me it was coming.  This time no communication, no apology for wasting my time.  They did thank me, but it really came up short.  If you want very good pizza, it actually is really good, but be prepared to wait in frustration as many of us were.  I won't be back as poor customer service usually kills a place and it goes downhill fast.  There are plenty of places that want my money and I'm willing to spend more when product and service exceed expectations."}
{"text":"Get the Detroit pizza, don't argue with me, just get it.  Great American Pizza offers an amazing array of taste choices in a crowded Pizza marketplace in northern Medina County. I simply won't bring Pizza into the house anymore unless it is from Great American Pizza or Fat Bob's. To my experience, everything else in this town is corporate crapola."}
{"text":"We will never order from here again. We were overcharged by $22 and the manager did nothing to correct it. Super shady company, shady people. We ordered from here regularly. So disappointed, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The Detroit pizza is phenomenal! Large topping, very tasty pizza, the Philly pizza is also fantastic. I'd order this pizza all the time if they had a location near me."}
