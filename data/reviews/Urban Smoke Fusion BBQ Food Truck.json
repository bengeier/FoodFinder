{"text":"I came by this truck at school where it was selling food as part of an event alongside other food trucks. The truck stood out from the others because of its modern appearance and because it was the only one with a vegetarian option - the Eddie Vedder. The Eddie bedder is a mushroom hamburger with organic greens, tomatoes, sweet pepper sauce and cheese. The truck had run out of cheese for my burger which they compensated by using cheese curds intended for the poutine that they also serve. I also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. The burger was better than I expected, the mushroom served warm was soft and juicy(idk). This was my first mushroom burger and I was not disappointed. The Mac and cheese was your basic creamy pasta. My friend ordered a brisket poutine which aside from the fact that there was too much gravy was also good. Overall I would give the burger and macaroni a rating of 8/10 and the poutine a 7/10. For the price of 10$ per item you can't go wrong by choosing to eat here."}
{"text":"Wow.  Never know that the food on a truck is so good, at least in Toronto.  The sun is rising high and the temperature is very warm.  Conditions for people to line up on the street for the truck food.  I tried the Beef Brisket sandwiches with Onion Soup Dip.   The bun is soft but able to hold the brisket without getting it wet.  The brisket is moist and melted.  By just tasting the bun without the dip is already attractive, not to say later to dip it into the Onion Soup.  The Dip is not mere a dip, it can be drank as a soup as it is not salty at all.  Quality is comparable to any restaurant.  Must try other menu later.

It is right in front of Sony Centre.  It's only Day 2 of Food Truck Fever of Toronto"}
{"text":"$10 for the Brisket sampler which includes sliced brisket, baked beans, coleslaw and jalapeno cornbread.  Surprisingly the brisket was pretty good considering it came out of a truck!  The cornbread was nice and moist, baked beans and slaw were OK.  I like that Urban Smoke prepares their brisket sliced and not pulled because there is a lot more skill involved and you can't really hide behind your sauce.  I do hope more Toronto food trucks have this kind of quality.  I posted a pic of the Brisket sampler."}
{"text":"I found a food truck that gave me an entire meal! Wohoo!  Finally.  Ordered beef brisket sandwich, which was very good. Had a nice smokey and honey flavour to it on a bun that was semi-crispy, and fries were seasoned well.  It was at Toronto Premium Outlets.  For $10, not too bad."}
{"text":"Omg! The most delicious sandwich I have ever eaten! 
So delicious! \"The Dirty Bob\"
A sandwich with delicious roast beef, cheese, mushrooms and onions with a side of magic fries! AMAZING!!! Anddd they have delicious dessert too! So good!
The most friendliest staff as well!"}
{"text":"Southern BBQ food truck located all across Toronto. You'll have to track them through social media to figure out where they're going to be. Menu centers around brisket and pulled pork, with some interesting items added as well. 

I opted for the Brisket sandwich with magic fries. The brisket is most and the sauce they use is wet, which I enjoy a lot more than the thicker kinds. The magic fries are just normal cut fries with some salt and extra spices. 

Try the brisket poutine as it looked pretty good. They also have a dessert grilled cheese with Nutella and marscapone cheese that's good as well"}
{"text":"The truck was at Globalfest and decided to give it a try. I had the beef brisket poutine. I tought the price was a bit higher (10$) but was well worth it when I saw the portion size. From the first bite to the last, it tasted incredible. The workers in the truck were also very friendly. Will have something from them if I see them at an event."}
{"text":"Came across Urban BBQ at CNT. Without online access to Yelp my stomach around, decided to join in the longer line (one of the more popular trucks in the fair) and ordered the pulled pork classic + brisket poutine. 

Brisket poutine - The (undrenched) fries were crunchy and well seasoned. Wished we ordered regular fries instead - The beef gravy was runny and flavorless.  All it did was sogged up the best part. They were also pretty stingy in portioning the brisket and cheese curds. Brisket I understand but cheese curds too? In addition, the brisket reminded me more of beef jerky - chewy and dry. 

Pulled pork classic - $2 dollar more than competing trucks but was served with fries. The sandwich was underdressed. The pulled pork was overcooked and tough. The bun was not toasted. Not the worst sandwich but there are just so many better options around! 

Overall - Urban BBQ is the prime example why I usually frown upon getting foods from food trucks - Overpriced, small portion, mediocre foods."}
