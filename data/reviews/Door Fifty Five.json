{"text":"Food is amazing and well priced especially the chicken and waffles!  Drinks are $15+ kinda on the pricy side  Just remember to try pink panther it's a deal on Thursday for only $10 it's a drink with gin, somewhat like a Shirley temple."}
{"text":"I was looking for a patio in streetsville and stumbled on Door 55. What a great find. Food is plentiful and tasty. They have a southern flavor with their own twist. I had the bucket of chicken with a terrific southern fried coating and enough spice to hook you. The mozz sticks are not your run of the mill sticks...try them. They have been open 6 weeks....check it out"}
{"text":"Ridiculous, we were served drinks at 2:10am and we're asked to leave at 2:17am! The bouncers are assholes and try to flex to try to intimidate us to leave. We were a group of 30 year olds and were not part of the rowdy crowd. They are obviously used to serving a younger demographic. Service from our waitress was good but I'm pretty upset at how we were asked to leave."}
{"text":"First off, I must say that I absolutely LOVE their drinks. There is a magical concoction called Pink Panther. A girlfriend brought me to door 55 years ago and I have to go here every time that I'm in Port credit. Their food is terrible though. Their wings, max n cheese etc, nothing is worth ordering. Stick to the drinks folks!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Good atmosphere. The servers take their time. I had to go to the bar to get a drink, and I thought I would have change but I didn't. The server afterwards bluntly told me she would not serve me because I didn't tip well enough. Not sure I will come back here as service is terrible. I then tipped 20% afterwards so the server could calm down. Overall, good music but servers are hard to deal with."}
{"text":"This location is currently being listed in my books as Needs Improvement for the time being as my visit last night just didn't live up to the high expectations that their original location has set in my mind.  For now, the pros are the location and the decor. They've really scored with this old pub they've taken over and converted into what looks almost like a mini German beer hall with long communal tables. They've really put a focus on making this place have it's own look and feel while maintaining some of the popular cool from the original - mission accomplished, I really love it. Also, the wrap around patio looks to be a superb addition.  Another pro was the appetisers we shared: poblano queso dip and Thyme fries. WOW! Between three of us, these starters were basically a main course. So cheesey and good was the poblano cheese with deep fried tortilla chips. And the cook and seasoning on the thyme fries was amazing.   The areas that need work were as follows and I don't plan to harp on them because I recognise that this place is newer and some kinks need to be worked out but without honest feedback from someone like me who IS a HUGE fan of D55, how will they improve? My plan is to return and reassess and upgrade this review:  - As others have mentioned they were understaffed and therefore service was spotty and slow. We waited long times at and betweene very step of service with some items not making it to the table at the same time  - Cocktails. I ordered the Old Fashioned, my favourite cocktail from their PC location and for some reason the Streetsville version did not match up. Within 2 sips it was already very watery  - Main courses. Brisket was over cooked and cold, as if it had been sitting for a while before service. The fried chicken did not fry properly or was over cooked and the batter fell right off the chicken upon being picked up. In addition, the chicken was ever seasoned and salty  As you can see there are 5 distinct points which if executed fully would warrant all 5 stars, currently I'd say they're around the 2 to 2.5 star range but all of the areas in need of improvement are totally and easily fixable.  I'm looking forward to returning here and re-experiencing Door 55 and giving them the 5 star review I know they deserve  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"We went in on a quiet night. Very solid food with some really great options. We were recommended two really great desserts which they unfortunately did not have so the manager ended up making something special for us as an apology. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Love this second location! The patio looks large and like a great summer time spot. This restaurant is a meat lover's heaven. They specialize in southern BBQ so probably not the best choice if you are vegan or vegetarian. The staff has great drink recommendations at various price points."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food, it's a great date night if you're cool with a little louder environment."}
{"text":"I liked this place when it was cock and pheasant! but I looooove it So much more being door 55.  Service is always really good & the food is amazing.   I love it Friday nights for the bar scene and Sunday's for a chill dinner with friends  This place can do both well.   If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night it fills fasssst, you won't get in after 11-12"}
{"text":"First time at this place, came in with a bunch of friends for a few drinks. I'm going to try and be nice; service was pleasant, we could tell the waitresses were new and still in training. Great ambiance, and very good food, that's where the positives end.  Slow, slow, slow!!! More than half of the bourbon list were not available. Services were  slow however when they came it was pleasant.  Note: Amex is not accepted."}
{"text":"Had very nice experience here!   The beer was good; food is delicious except the cheese sticks were a bit salty; service was very friendly.   Really enjoyed the patio at a summer night!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about lakeshore location, came here and was thoroughly disappointed. Food took almost an hour to come, while we waited, we were given re-baked fries that tasted awful. Later on was served chicken that was raw, waitress claims the chicken looks raw because of how they marinate it. Later brings chef and chef explains chicken \"can't be raw\" because chicken is pre-made and was only heated up to be served and cooking process was temperature controlled. 0/10 would never go again."}
{"text":"Finally they opened there 2nd location! Just in time for summer. These guys make the best cocktails in mississauga! Their location in port credit is my favourite bar! Now I can enjoy my favourite cocktails closer to home! My favourite cocktails are the old fashioned and smoke manhattan.  They offer southern style menu with delicious bits like boar Mac & cheese even stuff with alligator.   It's definitely worth the wait!!! And can't wait to spend my summer enjoying cocktails! Hope they open the patio up!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service a bit slow when it wasn't even busy, but the servers were very kind and attentive when they were there to wait on our table."}
{"text":"Best tomato dip and whiskey sours! Amazing small fun place where everyone is so nice, shoutout to the amazing bouncers who are so funny and nice!! The music is good and the whole place rocks!!new fave spot in mississauga"}
{"text":"Went to this joint a couple of days ago on a Wednesday night--I ordered a cocktail and the burger and had some of my friend's fried chicken. Honestly, the burger was not great... the patties were thick and tasteless and the whole thing was so hard to eat. The fried chicken was okay but nothing special, totally not as good as Popeyes or KFC.   The value for money also isn't there: the chicken was like 20 bucks and the burger was like 16/17. Despite the place being pretty much empty when we went, service was also lacking. I just truly and honestly don't see myself coming back here again other than for a drink (the cocktail was actually pretty good)."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE.  I was so excited to eat here based on all the reviews for the Port Credit location. We were a group of 8 girls that went for dinner. The chairs are really uncomfortable to sit on. The service was fine. Our waitress who was also the bartender was really nice. Tables are narrow and can get crowded easily if you order a lot of food.  My friend did order a refill for her iced tea & it came out 20 mins later, right as we were about to get our bills.   The food is not that great.  The mozarella sticks have way too much pepper in the batter. The dip that came with it did not look appetizing. The fries are absolutely disgusting. They were soft and mushy but almost seemed overfried because they were so dark in colour. They were not seasoned or flavoured although the chipotle mayo that came with it did taste delicious.   The food only looks good. But looks are deceiving. One of the girls in my party threw up when she got home. The rest of the girls woke up with upset stomachs the next day. We've all made multiple trips to the bathroom since waking up. The food made us really sick I would not recommend that you eat here unless you want to pay a lot of money for food that will make you sick. Also there is an 18% gratuity if you are a party of six or more.   The atmosphere is subpar. Nothing exciting. Nothing to rave about.  In short, DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that we did not order food, so keep this in mind for the review.  A few of us went for drinks on a very cold afternoon.  I was the designated driver and wanted to order a warm drink.  I was very surprised to hear from the waitress that they had no hot drinks available (not hot water, not coffee, no tea).  Given the scale of the menu this was surprising, especially since they offer several desserts.  My second issue is that when one of our friends asked for advice about ordering a bottle of beer (size), the waitress told him it was a little more than a pint.  Nope.  A pint is 473 mL and this bottle was 750 mL of 10%! It's also unfortunate that they were out of two different beers my friend had requested as his first and second choices.  The service was poor because of this misinformation and I would recommend the restaurant have the option of some sort of hot drink for the designated drivers."}
{"text":"Food is amazinnggg. Really crispy buttermilk chicken. Service was really great. Friendly servers. Didn't wait long to have the food on the table.  Ate outside was really windy but more quiet than inside. Great for groups also. It could be miss if you did not research for the place first as it is really in the deep end. But worth finding it"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for a going away party. The rustic decor was really cool, complete with giant wooden barrels, exposed pipes, and industrial lighting. The space was fairly small, but did had a patio area. The food portions were huge, and the food was trendy (chicken and waffles, cornbread muffins, mac & cheese sandwich; just to name a few), and tasted really good. Really cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the food. We shared the boss platter ($60). The brisket was dry, not juicy at all. Didn't melt in my mouth like other briskets do. The fried chicken was decent, but for the price, we only got 2 pieces which was disappointing. The only good part was the ribs, but those seemed a little dry as well. The bean chilli was mediocre - small portion as well.   I've had lots of better bbq platters elsewhere. If you want a good bbq, try Adamsons or Carbon Bar."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday at 8:30 pm. It's apparently the millennial hit spot so if you're looking for a quiet place for a drink and to chat, do not come here after 9.  I only had a drink, so my review is more for the service (slow to greet us and only gave us one menu to share) and ambience.   The patio closes at 10 because there's a rent agreement to keep the noise level down for the nearby townhouses."}
{"text":"i'm happy to see that this booming business has opened their second branch quite close to my area.  as per the original location, the decor is prohibition-esque, full of wooden hardware and dim lighting.  the food here is excellent.  some very nicely done southern cuisine with cajun & creole highlights, which is rare in mississauga.  to start, our party ordered the thyme fries and the cornbread.  both were delicious, but the fries could have been cooked a bit longer to give them that crisp crunch.  i ordered the blackened rainbow trout from a seasonal menu.  i usually expect a dominant black pepper flavour out of \"blackened\" items, but this one lacked that.  however, the fish was still cooked to a nice medium well, it was tasty by itself, and the spinach-mushroom fettucine it was served over was simple and complemented the trout well.  others from my party ordered the etouffee (seasonal), half bbq chicken with rice (also seasonal), and the notorious b.i.g. burger, all which were great.  aside from the southern food, it seems that door fiftyfive prides themselves on a large whiskey selection, and they do have quite an extensive list of that.  i tried the suntory toki as i've been dying to try japanese whiskeys, and was pleased with my dram.  the beer list here is decent, showcasing some good entry-level craft brews, so i wouldn't mind coming back for a beer.  all of this is topped off with some excellent service, as our party was frequently attended to with friendly attitudes.  then again, we dined on a tuesday night so there weren't many other people there lol.  highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had reservations for a birthday party on a Friday night and we came separate from everyone else but the bouncers gave us attitude and started going on about capacity... As the bouncer was speaking another staff came out telling him to let us in.  It gets super loud here, most of the restaurant is somewhat dark and it gets quite crowded so I see why it takes a while to flag down a waitress. We ordered the chicken + waffles to share, a Caesar and a Moscow mule. Chicken and waffles were good but super salty/peppery but it did taste good with the waffle. A lot of our friends really enjoyed the Mac and cheese (although it's pretty small) The Moscow mule came when we were nearly done our food and we were given the wrong drink. By the time the new drink came we were nearing the end of our gathering and it was really watered down.  The music was so loud, we had to yell at each other. We were even yelling back and forth with the waitresses (no wonder we were given the wrong drink). It's definitely not a place to chat over food and drinks. Took a while to flag down our waitress for the bill which was $56 with auto gratuity ($43 before).  A few changes in the atmosphere of this place could go a long way, but as of now I'm not so impressed."}
{"text":"Went there after continuously seeing it on the 'in sauga'. The food was very average for the price, location and hype. Nothing special. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the service due to the a rude experience with a bartender but the lady at the door was really friendly. My friend and I were ordering drinks and we wanted 4 shots in total. But when ordering the last drink I wanted to pay for it separately and I told him that but the music was loud and he did not hear me. I told him again after the total amount was given to us and he said no. I believe he said no because he was annoying at us for asking him a simple question."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and it was a great experience.Food was excellent, the server was super friendly and helpful. It was a nice atmosphere, unfortunately we left before the night life was about to begin.  Will be going back for sure to see what their night life is like."}
{"text":"So far I've had three manhattans on this trip. Each of the first two the bartender had to ask someone how to make it - then they didn't even use bitters.  On a recommendation from a coworker, I went to Door 55 to get myself a solid cocktail - not only was it just good, I was genuinely impressed with the craft of the bartender. After chatting him up more he made me a fantastic old fashioned with rum barrel aged Canadian whiskey and both chocolate & cherry butters. Good stuff.  Last, and absolutely not least was their brisket sandwich. Holy Shit. Melted in my mouth, perfect flavor balance, not too salty, not too smokey. Even if you don't give hoot about the whiskey - come here for that sando."}
{"text":"Second visit, and I can definitely see improvement from the last time I was here! Though the service was still reeeeeally slow (if you need more waitresses, let me know! I need a new job anyways...), the person who came around to us (who I'm presuming is the owner as well) was super nice and friendly, and even as we were paying he was talking to us a little about his involvement in the business and told us a couple of really cool stories. My friend and I got two orders of the fries, which is basically a huge plate with half sweet potato fries and half regular - I ended up eating all my sweet potato ones, while my friend ate all her regular fries - but I love the concept of that, AND it tasted great! We also sat on the patio (which was really pretty with all the cool lights strung up above!) and I have to say I liked it a lot better than being inside where the country music they play is so loud you can't hear the person next to you (maybe I'm just 80 years old!) Anyways, I'm definitely going to be going out to check this place out again - so happy to see a great place like this in Streetsville improving so greatly!"}
{"text":"What a fun place if you're in port credit. I've been twice. Food looks worth trying but the drinks menu is more interesting! The DJ plays good jams, slowly turning it up as the crowd swells around 11pm.  Tons of whiskey to choose from! You won't be disappointed!"}
