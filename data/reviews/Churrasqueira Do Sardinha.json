{"text":"Very cute family-run establishment. Fantastic rotisserie chicken for an incredible price, and the bacalhau is to die for..! I had a great time here. Had a chat with the top gun and it seems they've got quite a long history in this city."}
{"text":"I was craving Portuguese chicken, so I searched on Google for the closest place I could find. I was on college street so I walked over to Currasqueira do Sardinha. I am so happy that I did. The chicken here is amazing. I ordered a half chicken dinner with hot sauce. It was so juicy, and the skin was super good. The potatoes were soft and moist and the rice was also quite tasty. Very good value for your dollar.  If you're into mom and pop shops, this is a great place. The service was pretty good and the place was spotless. My wife is a cleaner and she commented on how clean this place is.  I will definitely come back. Great food, good service at a good price."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Had the grilled chicken dinner, which includes a quarter leg chicken plus two sides (rice, potatoes or veggies). The chicken was tasty but a bit on the dry side. Other than that, it was an enjoyable lunch.  Just a little note, the pricing for this place is a bit off. You pay $3.50 for just a quarter leg, or $4.50 for a quarter breast and if you want the 2 sides, it costs $5 extra. It doesn't make sense. Next time, I intend to just order a half chicken ($6.50). It's cheaper and I think I get more bang for my buck. Meat versus carbs - no brainer for me."}
{"text":"Was there on 19th October 2012 during noon busy hour for lunch. Ordered half chicken with rice and salad. The guy asked what sauce I want with chicken and I said \"hot sauce\". Thought he would give a bit on the side but instead took a brush and painter it all over the chicken. The salad was okay at best and was plain with nothing to be special. A total of two people came in during the entire time I was there which will give you an idea of how busy this place is during lunch and obviously speaks for the food quality. The chicken was very dry so much so that it will not come off with the plastic spoons. The food is below average and the raving reviews here are most probably by his family members. If the earlier reviews are true, then the  ownership has changed for the worst.    The Sardinha on bloor and delaware ave is WAY WAY WAY better and you will at least get decent cutlery and not the plastic crap. No offence to the business but definitely not the best of Portugeese food.Very disappointed"}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but no .5 ratings on yelp.  Frequently I am in little Portugal or Little Italy, and I see plenty of small 'hot table' type places, but unfortunately the 'whiteboard menus' in the window are rarely in English, so I usually walk on by.   This day I passed by this fine establishment with its Portuguese whiteboard, I noticed quite the line up. I daringly ventured into the unknown, opened the door and stepped in. To my surprise their menu inside was written in English and Portuguese. I could understand so I could order/eat there. I left, mind made up I would return later for dinner here.  A few hours I returned for a late dinner (6:30) with a friend. No big line up like the mid day crowd, but a few other customers inside awaiting take out or dining in.   Choosing to dine in, I grabbed a half chicken dinner, my friend a chicken sandwich. It came served on a plastic plate and with plastic cutlery. Somewhat of an environmental travesty. Too late to back out as I have paid, but this was not impressive.   The half chicken, I chose 'spicy' it was basted with a franks red hot type sauce, generic but it didn't ruin anything. Two sides were served with this. Rice and potatoes. Starch and More Starch. The roasted potatoes were decent, herb covered. This rice had olives in it. Flavorful. The chicken was moist. Juicy. Just how a bird is supposed to be cooked. That was satisfying. Overall a generous portion of food of decent quality.  But aside from the environmental travesty, the other thing that keeps this review low is the cleanliness. The table we ate at, although no lingering food scraps, grease stains. (The chicken and the rice were 'greasy') and from whatever may have spilled on the table from previous diners was just swept away I'm sure. Soap and water to wipe and disinfect a table is not too costly...  My friend was very impressed with the chicken sandwich. A generous portion of chicken on a fresh bun.  Maybe next time I'll just grab it to go..."}
{"text":"Delicious food my favorite churrasqueira ever (believe me I've tried many)"}
{"text":"In a city chock full of churrasqueira this place is among many classier joints. This one does has its fans though. Since it was a convenient stop-over for me to pick up supper, and right across the street from the beer store I had the chance to try it out a couple times. It was perfectly fine if you're in the mood for greasy chicken and potatoes. The rice was good too. They ask you if you want sauce and then they liberally coat the chicken with oil, so maybe hold off on that option. The hot sauce is served separately in a small tub as a side. They have daily specials and possibly the chicken here is not what many are ordering. The fish looked fantastic, and on Wednesdays there is a meat stew that has a rabid following with some customers I talked with while waiting. The service was quick and efficient the few times I've been and the prices are decent. Two can have a very satisfying meal for around $10. This reflects the blue collar history of Little Portugal and the vendors that feed the people there."}
{"text":"To all the yelpers dealing with Celiac disease; Eating 'Truly Gluten Free' when traveling can be very difficult but the folks at this great little Churrasqueira put me at ease right away. The owner happily answered all my questions so that I could make some safe GF selections and enjoy some tasty Portuguese food stress free. In fact, he is planning to make some minor adjustments to more of his dishes to cater to the gluten intolerant. The BBQ Chicken is off the charts. Fresh, tender, literally falling off the bone and soooo delicious. This is a second generation family business. The owner takes pride in the place and makes sure every surface is sparkling clean.  With just a few tables, it's clear that the business is set up for mostly take out which was perfect for me at the time. Reasonable prices for generous size servings.  Don't miss this place if you are traveling to Toronto."}
{"text":"To start off, I went to this place because I saw decent reviews, but to my surprise, my experience was nothing like I anticipated. I came in and saw a list of prices next to the cashier, I ordered one whole chicken, paid and the man who helped me started grabbing the food, I realize it was not the roasted chicken that I wanted, but the BBQ (charcoal). I told him about my choice and he was not happy with it, he said I didn't specify which one I wanted, he said the BBQ one would have an additional charge and I said there would be no problem. He looked like one of the owners or managers, and he was not friendly, and was even a bit rude. He gave me my food on take out containers and I asked for cutlery as I was going to eat there. He explained that the table were for people who are served and there would also be an additional charge (there was 2 or 3 tables and they were all empty), so he said he would let me sit there and eat for that time only.  Then, the chicken was dry dry dry, flavourless, the rice was cold and very ok (I could make better rice at home), side of potatoes were just roasted potatoes with salt.  I've been eating portuguese chicken for a very long time, went to many different places and this one surprised me in a bad bad way."}
{"text":"If you decide to go, expect poor customer service. From the cashier to the cook, they are slow, stingy, and care more about their own convenience than the customers. There are plenty of other Portuguese chicken places on College st. to try rather than reward this restaurant with another order."}
{"text":"Amazing Rotisserie chicken! Come here all the time! Best chourasco around! The potatoes are also pretty great with the hot sauce :) Friendly service, great food! It's my go-to spot for Portuguese chicken :)  Oh, and I wanted to respond to another reviewer. I have been here more times than I can count, and to address the complaint that upon walking in, they didnt greet you right away, I think this is just a politeness thing to be honest. I am almost sure that they just thought you were deciding on what to order and didnt want to pressure you.  Also, regarding the ribs, I haven't personally had their ribs, but I would have to say, given that it is a Churrasqueira, which means rotisserie house in Portuguese essentially, their specialty is chicken. Rotisserie chicken to be exact (Although the grilled is also very good).   So, to be honest, I'm not sure about the ribs, but remember this is a Portuguese chicken place. If you go to a churrasqueira you would do a diservice to youserlf to not get the chicken. Trust me, get the rotisserie chicken, get them to put the hot sauce on it (if you dont mind a bit of heat [more flavour I find], get it cut into quarters, have a side of the traditional perisian round potatoes and rice. Can of Sumol. And you got yourself a great Portuguese meal. Absolutley delicious. Chicken falling off the bone. Just thinking about it gets me salivating.. Pavlovs dog here :|   Anyway, I thought I should address that. Ive had some of their other food (octopus, bacalhau a braz), and its pretty good too. But the specialty, do yourself a favour, and get that famous rotisserie Portuguese chicken. Mmmmm might even go get some tonight now.. *-)   Oh, and, the people who work there have always been friendly to me and others I have come in with. I dont know if its a Portuguese thing, and just a cultural misunderstanding. My partner tells me how it often seems like we're angry, but its just passion :) :P I'm always happy, so dont mind the screaming, it's just how we talk haha :D"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of months ago with my parents for their inaugural Portuguese chicken meal - I was so proud *tear*.  This place is definitely intended more for take-out than eat-in, as there were only about 4 tables.  The staff were very friendly throughout my parents many questions (it's BBQ chicken, it's not that complicated), and eventually we sat down at the only table big enough for 3 people.  I could tell that it's a real family and neighbourhood joint, as everyone who came in got a cheerful greeting.    But on to the food.  This is Portuguese chicken done right - the flavour seeps right into the meat so that it's absolutely delicious even before you add the spicy and flavourful piri piri sauce.  My dad loves spice so he really poured this all over everything - and there was a lot to pour it on.  The servings were huge, with tons of potatoes and rice.  I was a little disappointed because I'd been led to believe that there would be shrimp in the rice.  There wasn't.  But it just took another bite of chicken to lift my spirits again.    All in all, great food at a great price that you should probably take home to enjoy.  If this was in my neighbourhood I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Localização agradável, preço bom. Fomos bem atendidos e a comida é muito boa. Volto com certeza."}
{"text":"We had the Portuguese chicken and the seafood paella.  Chicken was pretty good.  Not the best I've had, but I liked that the meat was tender and sauce was generally applied!  The seafood paella was a disappointment, however.  I think the mussels that were used were not that fresh.  The flavour of seafood completely dominated the paella...and not in a good way!!  Decor was nice, modern and clean for a churrasqueira.  I'd give it a 3.5 stars....but won't be coming back any time soon unless I'm in the hood!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and ordered a bunch of delicious food.  We had the roast chicken, rice, fish cakes, friend sardines and a chicken sandwich.  I'm not Portuguese and don't have tons of experience with Portuguese food, but the food was great.  It's obviously not fancy - food is served in metal take-out containers and paper plates -  but it is sure is tasty.    The chicken was most and tender.  The skin was crisp and even the breast meat was juicy!  Chicken sandwich uses the grilled chicken meat, which is smothered in sauce and served on a soft bun.   The rice was firm and well-flavoured.  Most notably, the portions are enormous.  We ordered the small and ended up with a small metal tin, which was filled to the max!  We split between 4 people and had left overs.   The fish was so-so.  They were cold, so not crisp anymore, but still tasty and the fish seemed fresh.   All in all, a very positive down-home experience and one we'll come back to!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for churrasco chicken and it's a very popular spot, so they are constantly making it fresh, which makes it moist and juicy. I recommend getting it with the hot sauce. 1/2 a chicken with sides can serve 2 people. I usually just get the 1/2 chicken for like $5 and make sides at home, but the potatoes are very good and they use a sauce similar to the chicken sauce. I usually do take-out, but there are a few tables and you can sit there and read some Portuguese newspapers. As I mentioned, this place is very popular for their chicken so sometimes you have to wait up to 10 minutes.  They also serve fish dishes, and some rice, and I don't know what else because the whole point is the churrasco chicken, so that's all I ever get there."}
{"text":"I had portuguese chicken, rice and potatoes from a place on Dupont street the other day and it just sucked.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I live 2 minutes away from this place and have been eating here forever, but this place is the best.  Their chickens are big AND juicy! A leg off one of their chickens actually yields enough meat to feed you, unlike most places in the City.  Mmm, I also love the little shrimps in their rice and their potatoes are fried and firm -- perfect for dipping in their hot sauce (which I could drink by the gallon!)  and their fish fillets and fish cakes are also very good.  Those portuguese sure know how to make some fish alright.  They also have a small selection of buns and loaves of bread (sometimes too crusty for my liking)  Line ups are common around Dinner time (be patient) and they close earlyish...I think at 7:30-8? because they're open pretty early."}
{"text":"I love Portuguese Chicken and have had it from so many different Portuguese Chicken places in Toronto.  When I worked at the LCBO across the street, I had a craving and decided to treat myself to a 1/4 chicken dinner.  It was like $8 and the woman at the front counter gave me the smallest, driest leg that had probably been sitting out for 3 hours.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.  A couple Portuguese people @ work saw it and went over and bitched them out.  Trying to take advantage of me cause I'm not Portuguese. Meh.  So many other Portuguese Chicken places in the area, don't come here."}
{"text":"This was certain out of my norm.  These sardines were super plump and big. Each one cost $1.50.   The grilled taste was cooked well. Everything about my sardine experience was magical. I would definitely come back for more.   You've got me on your side!"}
{"text":"The chicken was good...tender, well seasoned, etc.  Because the sandwich wasn't described on the menu I didn't expect him to douse it with mayo and add mustard.  I've had sandwiches at several portuguese chicken places, and have never had this happen.  He also poured a ton of sauce on it which made the bread really soggy and completely impossible to eat while walking down the street, which was my intent.  All in all, I probably won't be back given the variety of other portuguese chicken options in my neighborhood.  But if you do order the sandwich, make sure that you specify how you want it.  In terms of service, the guy working was very friendly and the sandwich was a decent price ($6.50, I think)."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich.  The bread was fresh and the sauce didn't taste exactly like Frank's Red Hot (one of my pet peeves since I am more than capable of buying that at the store and pouring it on chicken).  The chicken was tender and well seasoned (the pieces of chicken that I did get).  The price was also pretty standard for the neighbourhood ($6.50, I believe).  Unfortunately, the majority of the sandwich was chicken skin, pieces of fat, unidentified pieces of cartilage, and even a couple of bones.  Yuck."}
{"text":"There's so many good churrasqueira establishments in Toronto sometimes I feel it comes down to personal preference as to which is better. Since I'm writing a review for this one, safe to say this is my favourite in the city. I've been a regular customer here since the early 90s so the chicken here has been a guest at the kitchen table more frequently than most relatives. The traditional Portuguese rotisserie chicken here is the star of the show with the small potatoes and rice. Personally though I've always been more of a fan of their grilled half chickens and their perfectly salted fries doused in their hot sauce. This combo is hard to beat, the half chickens are oftentimes cooked to perfection and tastes as good as it looks.  The skin on the chicken is always mouth watering, and if that isn't your thing, the meat is pretty solid as well especially with their hot sauce on the side. They also have grilled sardines but you have to call in advance to place that order. I'm not sure if they still offer the sardines, but if you can convince the staff to take the order your in for a treat.  Like I said before, there's no shortage of excellent churrasqueira in Toronto, but this one just happens to be the best of the bunch for me. The store also doubles as a small grocery store for some imported Portuguese foods so its nice to get a meal and some snacks you can keep in the fridge or pantry."}
{"text":"I'm always eager to try mom and pop food joints hoping to find some little hole-in-the-wall gem. The problem is that I'm more often disappointed than I am rewarded with a new find.  Well, I was shopping on College Street and was hungry. I saw Churrasqueira do Sarinha. Did I mention I love BBQ? So in I went.  The place sorta looks the part of a mom and pop with potential. Napkin holders supplied by CocaCola. Chicken and ribs cooking on the grill. More chicken turning in the rotisserie oven. All 3 of the staff working (could've passed for husband, wife and daughter) had accents. Seemingly little money spent on decor - normally the trademark of a true mom-and-pop place.  No one acknowledged me though when I walked in. Even though I was the only customer. They looked up from what they were doing, then went back to what they were doing. The mom (the cook) kept flipping chicken and ribs on the grill. The dad (the order taker/cashier and manager-looking one) just went back to, well, managing. And the other woman went back to stocking the fridge. If dour looks and a detached attitude are prerequisites for good customer service, then this trio has customer service nailed.  Anyway, I ordered some ribs. They came with rice and potatoes. First, the ribs and rice were room temperature and the potatoes were sorta hot. Second, the ribs were bland. I recently tried the ribs from Longo's ready-to-eat section and they were surprisingly good. I would give them an 8 out of 10. Seriously. So now, those ribs have set the bar for me. If a restaurant that specializes in ribs can't beat the Longo ones, that restaurant shouldn't be in business. The ribs from Churrasqueira do Sardinha certainly don't.  The best thing going for this place is that they carry Sumol (sort of a Portuguese version of Sanpelligrino.) I love the passion fruit flavour!  So I guess the search for a good hole-in-the-wall is like the search for Prince Charming - you gotta kiss a few frogs along the way :-p"}
