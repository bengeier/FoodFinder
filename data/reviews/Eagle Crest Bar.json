{"text":"Amazing burgers!  Go hungry! Food is reasonably priced and Sunday breakfast is huge! They have long happy hours and drink specials daily. A gem neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, and cheap drinks.  Typical WI dive bar with good food."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  

We went for \"Taco Tuesday.\"  We waited for nearly 15 minutes before walking up to the bar to ask if we could get some service.  \"I thought you were helped\" the lady grunted at me as she took our order.  She was the only bar keep in the place.  Must have an Alzheimer's style memory. 

Nearly 10 minutes later our drinks showed up.  We witnessed others get their food that had ordered after we did.  We ordered the taco special, so being \"Taco Tuesday,\" one would think these would be readily available.  

Finally after 1/2 hour, we got our food tossed on the table.  The personable waitress didn't notice our drinks were empty, so I had to walk the glasses to the bar to get them refilled.  While waiting quietly, some Harley- riding local came in and he was greeted like royalty.  He barged right in front of me and he got served pronto. The bar tender went to him like files to a fresh pile of doo.   Thanks.

Looks like the only way you'll get served here is if you are known by the employees, ride a Harley, have more tattoos than stripper convention or poor hygiene.

The food was decent. At  $5.75 for a taco, the price was awesome.  I'd go back if it weren't for the lousy service.  Maybe I should buy  a new Electra-Glide next time I want a taco."}
{"text":"Nice country bar.you will not go home hungry and the big bloody Mary is very tasty.they have daily specials and big breakfasts."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you are very hungry. Portions are huge and the price is small. First time here was taco Tuesday.  Trust me you only need one. Tacos are huge and taste pretty good. Second time I went I had the bacon cheese burger. Huge burger with tons of bacon. Same person was working both nights. Very friendly and great service. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Checked this place out because it's not too far from my house, and a friend said they had great burgers. The burgers were only okay. 

The burgers at Eagle Crest are big and meaty. But as you may know, bigger is not necessarily better. These burgers aren't seasoned and are quite bland. A little salt and pepper would help a lot. Also, I'm pretty sure the mushrooms on my Mushroom Swiss burger were canned mushrooms. They were chewy and gross. The burger buns weren't so much toasted as burnt. Crispy chunks of burnt hamburger bun....yummmm. All 3 of us were pretty underwhelmed. I can honestly say that even the last fast food burger I had was better than the one I ate at Eagle Crest.

The bar itself is a pretty typical Wisconsin dive bar. Nothing fancy, with an interesting crowd. Plenty of televisions and gambling machines. There were only a few others in there around 8 pm on a Sunday. We were repeatedly told that we were lucky that the grill was still on, thanks to some guy who I assume is a regular. So I'm not sure exactly why it took about 20 minutes to cook 3 burgers. I'm also not sure what hours they serve food, so don't drive all the way out there for food if it's too late.

The sole employee on hand was nice and quite accommodating. The prices are low, considering the amount of burger they shove in your face."}
{"text":"So I see mixed reviews here and could understand some of it but not agree with all of it. Did some of you not check out Yelp first? And if not and you pull up and do not realize you are going into a local dive bar do you really know what you are talking about?

OK flame off.

I came here the other day for lunch. I had the right expectations so i was very pleased. I like dive bars if they have the right chemistry of relatively clean as this place is. Yes it is old and somewhat run down but not terribly so. I am giving this place 4 stars not for the decor but for the food. I had the prime rib with an huge plate of hashbrowns. I passed on the cheese and onions option included on them. The mushrooms are canned I would guess but who cares? I came for the meat which was an ample serving. I would guess about 24 ounces. The meat was cooked to perfection, seasoned well and the hashbrowns were very good. I could not finish the meal and never even took a bite of the 2 pieces of Texas toast. Is it the best I ever had like a Lawry's? No but it was really good and better than many I have paid triple the price for. And for 15 bucks you cannot beat it. This dinner and the sandwich option is a Wednesday special available all day. I would come back for sure. and maybe next time try the burger that so many folks like."}
{"text":"I can finally say that I've been to the elusive Eagle's Crest in the sticks of northeast Madison. 

Two days later, I am still struggling to digest the burger I consumed on Sunday morning. They don't even glamorize this real-deal burger with 16oz beef, 8 strips bacon and a think layer of melty cheese for $8. I can't even see how they make money.

Is it the best burger in Madison? I don't think so. It's not very well seasoned and the massive amount of meat is hard to handle. Is it an adventure in fun townie bar that has good cocktails? Yes."}
{"text":"Want to like this pub.  Big helpings but so so taste. Some of staff good others could care less.  Seem to cater to regulars mostly.  I would be one if not for crummy staff at times."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  I felt the need to update the restaurant.  Nothing has changed and that is what I love!

Consistency is appreciate when the quality is so high.  I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always.  They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy.  The truth is, they stick to good, simply and quality food.  So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous."}
{"text":"If you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar, this is the place to go. 
The burgers are so large that you should plan on cutting it in half and take the other half home. They are excellent!
If you order the bacon burger, you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it, I was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger. Amazing. 

I have also been to the Eagle Crest on Taco Tuesday. Prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see. If you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings. It's great. More than any one person can eat in one sitting. 

This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time. Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food. 

Since this is a bar, maybe the best Bloody Mary in town. It comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp, a beef stick, pickle, and green olives. A meal in itself. 

If your hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place I would suggest.
My new favorite bar."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had to date!!!! Friendly bartender, customers. Looks like they have \"regulars\" but don't let that bother you give them a lil conversation and they'll warm right up to you. Again amazing food. We're going to come in for breakfast tomorrow. Can't wait"}
{"text":"This has become a regular spot in our rotation, so I thought it time for an updated rating. My original review still stands true as for the general ambiance, friendly staff, and inexpensive prices. I was very wrong about what I thought I'd enjoy and not on the menu. 

THE BURGERS. I like my burgers well done and thus favor a thin patty because contrary to popular belief, not every person who likes their meat cooked through wants it burnt or dry. The cook at Eagle Crest is a master of the grill and she has cooked me a perfect, juicy, well-done burger every single time. The patties are a pound and the cheeseburgers are simple: bun, meat, cheese. Ketchup, mustard, and steak sauce are all available on each table, and all taste great with this beefy masterpiece. I can usually finish half. Three quarters if I'm ravenous. I've never been able to finish my plate. The good news is the burger reheats pretty well for lunch the next day. 

The BLT. This is a dive bar so it's not gonna be fancy, but let's be real: BLTs usually are best on white bread with iceberg lettuce and a ripe tomato. This is a delicious sandwich, but be forewarned: you will feel the need to preemptively dial 911 about halfway through as you realize there's likely an entire package of bacon on your sandwich. Probably best for sharing. Before I took a chance on the burger this was my go-to and I felt guilty eating just half of it. Go run a marathon then treat yourself to this salty, crunchy beast. 

The tacos. As I mentioned in my first review I love pretty much any form of taco, from fancy fusion to the ground beef ones my mom made while I was growing up in the midwest. The taco offerings at Eagle Crest were sadly just not my jam. One taco is enough - like everything on the menu they are hilariously huge. The overall flavor, though, was just cheapo Sysco blandness to the max. Everyone else in our group of eight enjoyed whatever variation they got (different fillings, taco salad, etc.) but I wouldn't order from the Taco Tuesday menu again personally. 

My boyfriend is a huge fan of the prime rib special, and we usually split the cheesy hash browns that come with his meal. They are also delicious, a giant portion, and very, very rich. 

Since you'll probably be driving to get there, enjoy a $1 Shirley Temple that's bigger than your head.

Long story short: clog your arteries and wash it down with inexpensive beer in a friendly setting."}
{"text":"BEST burger I have ever had..
Kay served the best drinks and the best burger I ever had in my life . Love this place  ever..."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of family members around noon on a Sunday. The parking lot is a cluster bc, apparently, if there aren't lines painted everyone forgets how to park. We came in the back door, which I'm not certain is an entrance, to see how busy it was. It had the typical decor/set up; decent sized bar with 10-12 tables. The staff was incredibly busy but still found time to greet us and assure us a table would be ready soon. 

Once a table opened up it was cleaned and our drink orders were taken, almost immediately. The bloodies were standard w slightly upgraded relish and my screwdriver was stout. All of us ordered something different for breakfast and were very pleased. Big portions for a small price. 

Service was fast, friendly and delicious. I hear their burgers are amazing. As we were leaving we had at least three people say 'thank you, goodbye'.  Very impressed with this place!!"}
{"text":"This place was gross and depressing.  We live nearby, but I will avoid ever going back.  We went to Taco Tuesday and were greeted with horrible service and even worse food.  I did not come here expecting anything nice or classy, so even with low expectations I left feeling slightly down and depressed from this sad place."}
