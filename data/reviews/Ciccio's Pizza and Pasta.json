{"text":"We received their flyer in our mailbox so I figured we would give them a try; should have read the reviews first.  We ordered their special: large pizza (3 topings), wings (1 pound) and 4 cans of pop.  When I placed the order, the woman said it would take an hour, so I thought okay, if it's good, it is worth it.  The time passed, so I called and she says, we are very busy he is on his way (total delivery time 1.5 hours). We get our pizza, looks good, but that is about as far as it went.The dough was undercooked, and had a funny taste that I cannot place, though the topings were generous. The wings weren't cooked either, ate a couple and threw the rest out.  Needless to say, that is my first and last time ordering food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great first experience! Ordered on Just Eat app, my boyfriend and I tried the eggplant sandwich and pesto gnocchi. We've been looking for a good, budget friendly Italian place and this is it! The order came with probably the best garlic bread we'd ever had and the portions were big. The food was very fresh and not your run of the mill Italian place or place that serves Italian; all for just under $20 including a tip for the driver and taxes. They sent a side of grated parmesan which I requested. 4 stars because it did take a while and was a bit after the estimated time of arrival, but definitely worth the wait! Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"I've made the mistake of ordering from Ciccio's twice. The first time was because I was starving and they were the only place nearby that was open. The second time was because I forgot the name of the place with the bad pizza and was starving and they were the only place nearby that was open.

Lesson learned.

While their prices are quite good, the pizzas have been fairly bland. My first order was someone else's pizza and it took over an hour to show up. The replacement pizza that came when I called and complained came in about 25 minutes but was burnt. My second order was the right pizza but was dry and felt like it was missing half the amount of toppings it should have had.

If you want cheap pizza, you could do worse than Ciccio's, but why would you go to Fresh Slice when you can just buy a McCain pizza and get the heartburn for free?"}
{"text":"Great calzone! Very big and satisfying. Bit greasy, ordering for pick up took awhile."}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star. They lied about my pizza being on its way to delivery when it was clearly forgotten about and it took 2 hours for the pizza to arrive. Not acceptable and horrible customer service. There are PLENTY of other much better pizza places in Toronto that can actually deliver on time. Pizza itself was so subpar and came cold! Worst off the delivery guy was downright rude to the people at my place. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so delicious. I always order a cheese pizza and the BBQ dipping sauce and it's so simple yet so good delicious every time. My boyfriend recently got a diavola calzone for the first time there and said it was the best calzone he'd ever tasted. The hot peppers inside were real hot peppers, not just bagged banana peppers.  I've tried the pasta here and it's not the best, I think it's the sauce that I didn't like, so I just stick to the amazing pizza now. Overall, this place is amazing and I go back regularly."}
{"text":"I discovered Ciccio's on justeat.ca this evening. I ordered the cheese manicotti and caprese salad. The pasta was excellent! It tasted very authentic with a delicious tomato sauce. It wasn't very expensive either. I will definitely order from Ciccio's again."}
{"text":"We ordered two meals for delivery. Spaghetti with meat and veggies, fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and veg. And two salads. It was by far the most disappointing meal. Out pastas had nothing in them.. No meat or vegetables. They were sauced but that's it. It was so tasteless I added salt to it but still had to throw it out. It just tastes like plain pasta. Nothing to it. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place saved us in our Friday and Sunday night hanger. The calzones are so legit and absolute monsters. The chicken calzone was devine and the portion was way more than I expected. Definitely turned me into a return customer for sure. The delivery time was also awesome way less than we had expected. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Pizza, calzones, pasta, and salad never disappoint. I've been ordering from them for years and the quality is always great."}
{"text":"I've only tried the meatball sandwich and it is absolutely delicious. I used to get it once a week and it was consistently amazing. I still think about it from time to time. Do yourself a favour and try it with the works (mushrooms, peppers and cheese). 

This sandwich is best eaten after bad breakups because no matter how bummed out you are, it's impossible to be sad while you're eating it."}
{"text":"Ummm, the risotto was not. It was more like unfried rice... I didn't think that that was possible! 
Too rushed, and too much sauce, not enough loving. 

The garlic bread with cheese, was just decent bread, with some liquid splashed on that presumably tasted like garlic and was layered with plastic type cheese. It was not appetizing.

The Pizza, MEH. The portions are HUGE, but the taste and texture are just meh meh meh. I know not helpful. Prices are not great for what you get. The Wings are boring, naked and you have to apply your own sauce. Just mix it at the restaurant man! Its sooooo easy, then the chicken will taste like something other then your unchanged deep fryer!"}
{"text":"I had the opposite experience of Alan. When calling in an order, the guy was jovial and cheery and all was well. The delivery showed up in a quick time frame, driver smiling and friendly as well. With $17 + tip for two 4 topping calzones delivered to my door, we seemed like we were off to a good start.

Upon opening and cutting these bad boys up, I realized that we may be in for a less than desirable meal. Grease literally oozed out and flooded the box. It was downright watery insides and the ingredients were sliding right out of the crust, and to top it off, the chicken pieces they use are pretty tiny. After letting it sit and do its thing before trying to dig in to it, I then realized that the supplied marinara sauce was also, for lack of a better word, garbage. It was like someone took a regular tomato sauce and added 1 part water for every 1 parts sauce. I mean we're talking too liquidy to even stick to outside of the calzone so you had to hope it was being absorbed into the meat and dough as you dipped. Even on the reheat, hoping that the refridgeration would set the cheese and ingredients overnight making for at least decent leftovers, but no dice on that even.

I think the only reason I'm giving it a 2 star review is because the price and people I had to deal with were 3 stars, while the food was 1 star."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and their food is great!  Their chicken cannelloni is to die for probably because their sauce is fantastic!  Also try their bruschetta pizza cause its awesome!"}
{"text":"This \"italian\" restaurant is gross. It's utter garbage. I ordered delivery. I ordered the tortellini Alfredo and bruschetta as an appetizer. The tortellini was soggy, chewy, and grey... Tasted like it was bought from a dollar store. The bruschetta was put on a ciabatta bun, cut in 4 pieces, and little pieces of tomatoes, onions and mozzarella cheese was put on top. It tasted like a soggy big bun with a piece of old tomato and onion on top of it.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE. Food is horrible and not \"italian\" at all."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Ciccio's but it took a friend's recommendation to push me to try it out. 

Yes, the woman on the phone is slightly rude, but I'd rather think of her as efficient and  competent. \"You wanna order? Okay you ordered. Come get it. 20 minutes.\"  When I come to pick it up she's ordering someone around to pack all my food in a small cardboard box for me to transport home -- with the salad on top away from the hot food. 

I've tried the pizza, pasta, sandwiches and salad and everything is delicious. The dressing for the house salad is particularly nommy, but I'm sure all their salads are good. 

Also this place is cheap! Two sandwiches, pasta and salad was $27.50."}
{"text":"I was staying with some girlfriends in Queen West and we were looking for something to eat on a Sunday night-- something quick, easy, and cheap! We decided to walk up to Dundas and literally walked up on this little joint. It doesn't look like much as first sight but just a look at the extensive menu gives you the feeling that whoever is in the kitchen knows what they're doing when it comes to Italian food.

A charming older gentleman helped us out and got our orders sorted. He was really great about taking our substitutions or add-ons with our meals. It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready, which is not bad considering they baked up two fresh calzones and a fettuccine plate. We decided to eat right there in the shop and the food was spot on! The calzones were huge and so delicious! But I did notice that my calzone was missing the sausage I had added into it, so I mentioned it to the man at the counter and they were ready to bust out a fresh calzone, but I insisted a bit of sausage on the side would be sufficient (because I could barely finish my first calzone let alone another one). They quickly cooked up some sausage for me and he gifted us a tiramisu for us to share for the extra wait time.

This place is definitely a local operation (maybe even family owned and operated), so it was totally worth waiting a little extra to get some good food. Definitely a great spot for a filling, delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, simple Italian fare for delivery or take-out. I came here because it's close to the Toronto Western Hospital and very convenient for picking up lunch/dinner to bring back to work. The pastas and pizzas are made to order, so you will wait 10 minutes or so unless you phone ahead. Portions are massive and could probably make 2 meals. Pasta come with garlic bread. I had the fusili rustica ($8.50) which was hearty and delicious, with pieces of chicken in a rose sauce with goat cheese. Lots of vegetarian options as well. Great value, yummy food, and nice people."}
{"text":"This place is an office favourite for delivery. Their pastas are giant and delicious. Their pizzas are also very good."}
{"text":"had their thin crust with cheese, tomato and spinach. best i've had so far in toronto!! totally unlike those branded chain places. the cheese is gooey, dough is thin enough, and spinach adds a really nice flavour. i had the whole pie to myself! i'm seriously thinking of sticking to this for pizza!"}
{"text":"ordered delivery at orderit.ca took them an extra 25 mins to arrive 

gave me complimentary tiramisu though cant really complain but the pizza is very soggy!! and tiramisu is soggy too!! i wonder why everything they serve are soggy LOL anyways even when a pizzas bad its still pretty good! probably wouldn't order again though considering the wait time"}
{"text":"Ordered for my first time tonight and I really enjoyed it.  Taste like home cooked Italian food. The Greek salad was so fresh, I'd come back just for the salad alone!  My boyfriend didn't enjoy it as much, but he's more into those \"brand name\" pizza places so that should tell you something about his taste.  Highly recommend for cheap eats."}
{"text":"Take my advice- do NOT waste your money here. 

My friend and I ordered from here late at night as there weren't many options left. The food descriptions on the menu are outrageously misleading. 

We ordered the seafood pasta (the one that is said to have \"generous\" amounts of seafood). Absolute garbage. The food arrived on time (the only good thing about the experience) and was hot, but the pasta itself was hardly edible. It was a giant pile of mushy spaghetti smothered in a bland oily tomato-ish sauce (the taste, or lack thereof, rather, resembled nothing of a tomato). The \"generous\" seafood was a tiny pile of diced up over cooked calamari, TINY baby shrimps, and disgusting clams. The order came with \"garlic bread\" which in reality was focaccia smothered in what tasted like- oops, did not taste, rather, so therefore was probably some sort of vegetable oil. 

Gross. Bland. Lazy food. Not worth the money or time at all. You're better off ordering a pizza from a chain."}
{"text":"Ok, if your looking for real Italian food, at fair prices (I would happily pay more but glad I don't have to) look no further. Ciccios is consistently great Italian food - even when delivered! No qualms of any kind here on my part"}
{"text":"I finally found a restaurant that delivers good Italian food!  The chicken parm was amazing - will definitely order again!
They said it would be delivered within the hour and it was - and the delivery man was really friendly, which is rare.  Based on the chicken parm and the delivery, I'll order from them again."}
