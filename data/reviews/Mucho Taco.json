{"text":"When I crave homemade Mexican food but I'm at work far from home, this place is just as good! The people working there are really nice, work hard and make great food! THIS IS NOT A HOLE IN THE WALL, the place is very clean and the great service I get surprises me every time."}
{"text":"We love, love, love the carne asada taco's at this place. It is a little whole in the wall kind of place but clean and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Have you been to Mexico and had tacos from the street carts? Hot and yummy it hits the spot after a night of drinking. You can get the same kinds of tacos and more here. They have five or six kinds to choose from and all of them are pretty good. They also have a wide range of other mexican foods to choose from. I should know, when I go there I often order four or five items. A couple of tips about this joint are: 1) if you dine in you get free chips and salsa. 2) if you like tamales order the red. it has beef in it. the green only has chiles and cheese. Overall the place is a good value and I have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"I dropped in last night craving tacos. I ordered half of the taco menu times 2, cabeza, tripas, El pastor and carne asada. I was very impressed. the place was clean the customers there were laughing and talking and the young lady at the cash register answered my question with confidence. I will be returning tonight to order the other half of the taco menu."}
{"text":"Home cooking for sure and super delicious!!!  Not the best of areas, but you won't be even notice after your taste-buds are whisked away to Grandma's House.  We go here once a week at least.  Super affordable, super yummy and super friendly!  Like being at home without having to cook!!!  ps....the chili rellenos are to die for...I order 2 with green sauce and a side of beans....it's the BOMB!  Carnitas tacos is also a weekly favorite!"}
{"text":"I see everyone else gave this restaurant a high review, so perhaps I got them on a bad day.

I ordered the Tamale combo. It was obvious that it was microwaved and thrown in some sauce. The beef was extremely dry, it was refrigerator cold in the center and scorching hot on the ends. Very little flavor.

The rice wasn't cooked all the way so I kept getting hard rice chunks, then finally the beans were so watery that I couldn't eat them with a fork at all. I thought maybe I'd mix the beans and rice, maybe it would make it a consistency I could eat. 

Don't think I will be going back, the whole meal was bland, and lacking in flavor, but all had the same dirty grease taste to it, and how you get that with a tamale is beyond me. I didn't finish it, and didn't save it for left overs. Had I not purchased it as take out I would have returned it immediately after my 2nd bite, I even considered taking it back to the restaurant and telling them how bad it was..

Good to see that other people had good experiences, but I took a chance on a little place and it did not work for me at all!"}
{"text":"This is a Chandler gem, hosting authentic Mexican flavors and dishes. Tacos , rice beans, all the real deal when it comes to home-style cuisine"}
{"text":"I have some great experiance of food from Mucho Taco.  I ordered a carnitas taco, the Chimi de Asada, and a churro.  

After I placed my order I had time to look around and this is really a cute place.  Very clean, and I like the décor on the walls and the painted tiles.  It's small, but really has a nice atmosphere.

I get my food in 15 minutes............. Great service, I am definatley going back :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 5 years and I love the food, the service and the price. The funny thing is... I can go to Abuelos and spend 40 dollars or I can go somewhere else, but I really like the \"no hassle\" service.

I don't ever need to wait for a table. The food is always fresh and available. 

I have had places like Olive Garden tell me they ran out lasagna or Paradise Bakery run out of mushrooms. 

I never have ever had a problem here. I love the enchiladas and fish tacos!
The burritos are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Okay, I know I shouldn't have ordered nachos for lunch. But it sounded good. I also now know to order tacos at a place called mucho taco. All the tacos and other food flowing from the kitchen did look really good, so I was excited to get my nachos. Waste of $5. A little bit of bean and a little cheese, that's it. I do think I will come back at some point for the tacos but avoid the nachos! - see picture!"}
{"text":"I was very lucky today as I walked in their lunch special was \"MOLE\" oh my!  I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized..."}
{"text":"i love this place! Its right by my work and I go over and grab some food on the regular. Their food is really authentic and wonderful. Everything i've had is great from burritos, tortas, quesadillas y mas! the marisco is also really good y bastante picante. The price is really reasonable, except i'd like more guacamole for my 2 bucks. I'll keep coming back for more! Thanks Mucho Taco"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!  Have been looking for a taco shop like this for some time since I moved to the PHX area.  I must say - I finally hit the jackpot.  Cabeza, tripas, pastor, carne asada, ceviche, etc....it's all fantastic so far.  They even do red munudo on the weekends (for that lovely hangover).  I HIGHLY recomment this to anyone who appreciates real mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Typically I wait to try a few things in the menu before I review a restaurant. This is just for the readers looking for something on Saturday or Sunday. That something, is the menudo. It's perfect. Buy it."}
{"text":"The food is very good but they tend to price the food and bit more than what the menu price says I've caught it twice while I was there just watch out when you are paying for the food"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Tacos were great and the salsa that came with the free chips was delicious"}
{"text":"This was my latest taco stop, and it is an all around fine place. I had their tripe tacos, the al pastor and the carne asada. The tripe, I asked for extra crispy and it was but I don't think they clean out the tripe, so it is a little grainy, a little gross if you think about it but it is perfectly sanitary since it has been deep fried to a crisp except the inside is again grainy. Carne Asade taco was good, crisp and chewy, lacked a little flavor. The Al Pastor was so so, it taste just like chorizo seasoning, that is the second place that has happened so I don't know if it might be a regional thing. Coming from out of state, the Al pastor tacos I had before had seasoning but not like this though. They did give free chips if you eat in, They were okay, their drinks are not home made, just come from a dispenser like others. I would give it a lower score, but they were definitely better than some of the others. I would mostly likely never come back since nothing was worth coming back for. It is an okay taco place though if you are around the corner and needed a place to eat. I ate 4 tacos and a medium drink and came to be around 9.50 so I would have to say it is average in cost."}
{"text":"Great place to eat the staff is always friendly. The food is also great my favorite are their tacos. Their carne asada burritos are also very good. This is my home away from home."}
{"text":"I used to love eating here except yesterday I went to eat and right off the back a customer was handing there food back to the lady at the register saying how it's the second time that there food had hair. The service was horrible and rude! And when I did get my food it looked like my tacos didn't have the meats in it I basically had to combine 3 tacos to make one! And the price for what I got was a joke. Not sure what happened but I'll never go back there again nor will my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing Caldo de Pollo and Menudo!  Brought me back to life.  Mucho Chimichanga is super good too.  Ordered for pick up, the soup was still blazing hot once I got home.  Something special about this place.  I will be back for more food!"}
{"text":"I am very upset as I write this review.. i ordered my Food to go and I get home and it is nothing I ordered and the food looks and tastes reheated.. i won't be coming back ever! Service was horrible."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a place like this! Food was delicious and flavorful.  We have live in Chandler,AZ for 7 years and didn't find this jem  until this morning.  Thank you Yelp! We will spread the word about Mucho Taco to all our friends and family.  Menudo was perfect! Street tacos moist and simple."}
{"text":"Mucho Taco was ok.  It was nothing unforgettable; in fact, I'd forgotten about it.  While reading Andrew S's review I got to the part about his gf's Chimichanga, and I did a double take because I hadn't realized I'd been with him  for the experience in question.

As mushy as the chimichanga was, it had good flavor.  I'd give the place another chance, and probably get a burrito.  My only other complaint is what seemed like an unnecessarily long wait to get our take-out order.  

Located next to a Goodwill and in the same strip as several other small businesses, this place is easy to miss.  I probably wouldn't miss it if I weren't to retuurn, but it's decent enough if I needed some Mexican food nearby."}
{"text":"We LOVE Mucho Taco. Family owned, nicest people. Amazing chips and salsa. Amazing drinks and food. You have to try it. Love the street tacos and chicken tostada!"}
{"text":"My family and I went there last night and we were pleased with the authenticity of the food.
I had the Tamale plate and was surprised at how flavorful and fresh they were. I also had the Tripas tacos and they were the best I have had here in AZ. My wife had chicken tacos and my son had the asada burrito and both raved about the flavors. everything we had was cooked to order. 

The owner was very accommodating and checked on us several times to assure we were Ok.  

I read some of the negative comments and suspect it may be a little too authentic for some people's idea of what authentic Mexican cuisine is supposed to taste like.  I guess that is why Garcia's and Serrano's are so popular."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because it had many high scores from people. My daughter found this place. We all were craving Menudo with toasted, buttery bolio bread.  Walked in and several people were eating the menudo. Ordered my menudo with iced tea and my toasted bread. Served us some salsa and chips. Those tasted good. Then I received my food. Looked good - then my first taste was okay what is that taste. It wasnt spicey. So I added more crushed chili and salt. Then tried it again. Yup, I was very disappointed.  The menudo had a smokey flavor to it. Not smokey like burnt taste. But it was made to taste smokey. Yuk! I couldnt finish it. My tea was horrible.  Tasted like it had been sitting in a dirty pot that hasn't been washed. We thought it was the sweet n low sugar. But it wasn't. I give this place thumbs down! :("}
{"text":"Been here several times and the food has improved. I had some very tasty enchiladas and some great nachos. Definitely better than Filibertos."}
{"text":"Reasonable pricing and great  selection and variety of Mexican food. They can add a salsa bar and give it an extra incentive to return."}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch with my husband, and wanted to check this place out after hearing they had good Tripa Tacos.  I already had a feeling it wasn't going to be that great, but what the heck, I always pick where we go so I let him have it ;) The dining area is nice! Very clean and well maintained it definitely has that Mexican feel to it with the curios and Spanish tile layout on the walls. The girl working the counter was very friendly!  I ordered a carne asada burrito w/ side of rice and my husband had 2 tripa tacos and 2 chicken tacos. As we waited, we were given chips and salsa! Oh gosh! The tortilla chips tasted like that \"fridge\" taste, when you put something in the fridge and dont cover it up well! *barf* how hard is it for a Mexican place to get a dam tortilla chip to taste right?!!! The salsa however was really good! Chunky but NOT spicy! Not even a kick! I asked the girl if there was a more spicy salsa and said they dont have any!! What the He11!! A mexican place that doesnt serve HOT salsa?? That is just WRONG & UNAUTHENTIC!! We finally got our food, pretty quickly. I looked at my husbands tacos and they just looked so sad and empty. Barely any tripa in the dam taco! Then his chicken tacos had lettuce and tomoatoes!! WTF!! Lettuce and tomato?? Thats some crap you see at Taco Bell! We were expecting cilantro, onions and cabbage! Not this crap! Then my burrito was kinda small, the torilla was really good it tasted homemade and was warm. The carne was super small cut up it looked like lengua. It was upsetting! Right on the menu it says AUTHENTIC. Bullcrap! Your better off going to Filibertos or Los Favs which arent even authentic but better than this!"}
{"text":"I come here a few times a week for the chips and salsa and shrimp tacos.. The horchata is the BEST in the area...they have fresh limeade and pineapple juice that they make daily..

I recommend any chicken dish since they spice it so good... The taquitos are a great value and a meal in itself $3.99.. Now fir the best shrimp tacos in the world... The shrimp are seasoned and grilled ( not fried), juicy and it cones with a big slice of avocado and fresh pico on the taco.. I could eat 6 of these and still want more.

This is a small family owned joint and the owners are friendly and keep the place really clean. I just can't say enough about this place... I LOVE it... It's like going to an old friends house and being treated with TLC... Oh and the police like to eat here too, so I feel pretty safe"}
{"text":"To be honest... I have no idea what these low reviewers got when they came here because I received 5-star all around. After I left I actually felt bad for not leaving more of a tip - it was that good.

I didn't expect much but the food came out lightning fast and it was very good. The service was amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice-cream (that the kid didn't eat) back in the freezer while we ate."}
{"text":"The girl was sooooooo nice taking our order!!! She also had some fly ass makeup so we told her, again she was sooooooooo sweet!!!!! I ordered 4 carne asada tacos and a large horchata! The place itself is so cute, LOVE the Mexican tiles on the walls! Chips n salsa, AMAZING!!! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"This place looks like a total hole-in-the-wall dive joint (near Goodwill at Alma School and Ray Road).  Having said that, the food is fantastic!  I really love the salsa and chips.  To me, the salsa tastes like a cross between the mild and hot sauce at El Palacio - another of my favorite restaurants near Chandler.  Food tastes fresh made.  I had two cheese enchiladas and a chile relleno burro.  The enchilada sauce is very authentic, and very tasty.  The chile relleno burro is huge - it is stuffed with all sorts of stuff - an entire meal in and of itself.  Be sure and check out the daily special.  I noticed it after I made my purchase, and it would have been an awesome deal.  Prices are very reasonable.  Also, I must say whoever brixes the soda fountain does a great job - the Mr. Pibb tasted perfect!"}
{"text":"If you are missing home come to this place! It was recommended to me by a friend and it's just like nanas food. The novelas playing on the tv and the friendly staff is just a bonus to its authenticity."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and I hadn't been to Mucho Taco until a friend recommended it. It's great!
I ordered three tacos: carnitas, carne asada, and pescado with a side of rice and beans. They bring fresh salsa and chips to your table while you wait for your food. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but the staff was kind and the food came out fast. I would have liked lime wedges served with my tacos, but the tortillas were outstanding and the food was tasty and prepared well. 
I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm a food snob and a risk taker. I pulled into the parking lot faced with a difficult decision. Untested Mexican or Thai food for dinner. I read the yelp reviews for both, as any patriotic American would,  opted for mucho taco and was seriously disappointed.  I only ordered 6 tacos. Yes I did get the complimentary chips and salsa (also 5 stars). But I'm afraid the craving for more cannot be sated by any fewer than 20 of these perfect tacos. Generous pricing, a clean restaurant and excellent service round out a top notch experience. Bravo mucho taco!"}
{"text":"Best Arizona Style Mexican Food in town. I love the red chile pork plate with flour tortilla. It's seriously off the hook ridiculously good. The rice and beans are great.  It appears to be run with the family's secret recipes. The tortas are also incredible here, I get the carne asada, but the key here is all the homemade sauces and fresh quality food. It's a small place and kind of a secret.  Super friendly staff and always clean. My only disappointment is realizing I cleaned my plate and have to leave.   All the customers seem to have that look on their face like they struck gold. Not the fanciest location, so put on your work boots and don't miss out. 'HIGHLY' recommended!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for EXCELLENT Mexican food - this is your place. The prices are great and the food is terrific! Nowhere in town will you get better refried beans - yes, they use lard but if you are wanting health food go to a salad bar!! If you want the best mexican food - go to Mucho Taco. My favorites are the #1 Taco, Enchilada, Rice & Beans or the Carnita Torta!! Yum! Yum!!
The employees are great and attentive and the restaurant is clean - big bonus!!"}
{"text":"I've really scored lately with some places I've tried for the first time.  I had some great takeout over the weekend from Mucho Taco.  I ordered a carnitas taco, the Chimi de Asada, and a churro.  

I was a little nervous as I walked in because I've heard this place is pretty authentic and the only Spanish I know is from watching Sesame Street.  But the young woman working at the front counter smiled and greeted me right away, which put me completely at ease.  

After I placed my order I had time to look around and this is really a cute place.  Very clean, and I like the décor on the walls and the painted tiles.  It's small, but really has a nice atmosphere.

My food was ready in about 10 minutes and as I drove home the first thing I noticed was how good it smelled.  Oh my...the whole car smelled like carne asada and rich, seasoned enchilada sauce.  (They serve their chimis enchilada-style).  

While I was unpacking it, one nice little touch I noticed was that someone stuck a tortilla chip between the guac and the sour cream just to keep them apart for transport.  It may end up a rich gooey mess on my plate, but it's not going to start out that way.  That made the presentation very nice when I opened the container.

The carnitas taco was small, street taco style and had a very good flavor, but the meat was slightly dry.  I added a few chopped tomatoes and a little guac and it was perfect.  I would definitely get that again.  

The chimi was full of delicious carne asada.  They really know their stuff here.  The meat was good quality and so tender it melted in my mouth.  I had half for dinner and then the other half the next morning with an egg on top.  DEE-licious!  

And the churro was a nice sweet way to end the meal.  My total before tip was $10.42.  I was very impressed with the attention to detail and the flavors.  The enchilada sauce had a great blend of seasonings that was way better than any I've had before.   I look forward to trying more items on their menu.  Gracias, Mucho Taco."}
{"text":"For street tacos, these were pretty good. My husband liked the carne asada. I took part of the cashiers suggestion and had a carnitas taco, plus a chicken (my choice). I should've listened to her fully. The carnitas was off the hook! Chicken was fine. Just...fine. Only real downfall was the iced tea was old, which tastes nasty. The cashier gladly gave me a Bottle of water instead."}
{"text":"Awesome mom and pop shop. Recommend to me by my very favorite hotel concierge Angelica. 
Wonderful food. Not just because of the large portions but because the food is spectacular. I had the verde pork with the homemade tortillas beans and rice. Enough for two meals by the way. 
Great place for lunch or dinner if you are a true Foodie !!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California, so I have had plenty of experience eating at taco/burrito shops.  I demand not only good quality, but good value.

I placed an order for a carnitas burrito with rice added (for $1 extra).  I wanted it like they do in SoCal -- rice, meat and beans.  I also ordered a tamale, which I normally do when I visit a new Mexican food restaurant to gauge their quality.  If they make excellent tamales, that's a sign that they care about quality.  Well, the good news is that the tamale tasted great -- very authentic, the bad news is that it was tiny... maybe 4 oz. at best?  They give you this huge takeout box, which lends to the disappointment when you open it to discover a half-anemic tamale.  The carnitas burrito with rice?  What rice?  In fact, I want to know what happened to the burrito -- it was the size of something I would find at Taco Bell.  Mind you, this was a $5.50 burrito, and for that much I wanted more than a small Taco-Bell-style burrito (that I can get for $2.00).  So no only was the burrito tiny, but it was missing the extra rice.  Overall, for the $7.50 I paid I was very disappointed.  Not worth the money.

I sensed  an order error might happen when I heard the cashier call-out the order to the cook.  When ANY restaurant uses the word-of-mouth system to place orders in the kitchen, there is a huge possibility for error (as happened in my case).  This is unacceptable and their order system should be changed to a computerized system.

Pros:  authentic taste, fast friendly service, fresh home-made tamales

Cons:  Small, anemic servings, poor order taking, slow cleaning of tables"}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've found in the east valley!! Delicious meats, perfect spicing, fresh tortillas and great salsa!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Absolutely the best al pastor in the valley (that I've found so far). Everything else is great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is good, price is right and the service is great. They are always very pleasant and friendly people. I took a friend here for his first torta and the guy at the counter was willing to answer any questions he had and even recommended a torta with half pastor and half carne asada so he could try both. Plus I like the fact that it's fast casual food but you still get chips and salsa. At Elmer's up the street it's more expensive and you don't get chips. Mucho taco is muy sabroso."}
{"text":"They serve the simple \"street\" style tacos I like. I had one al pastor and one asada. Both tacos were tasty. The al pastor had a nice spice to it. I also had a green tamale that was really gross. All masa and barely any cheese or green chile they said was suppose to come in it. Can't seem to find a spot with good tamales around here. I also got a jamaica to drink and wished I had gotten the horchata that I initially wanted instead. It was watered down and sour without the sweet.  So basically... come here for the tacos... don't bother with anything else. 

*Note: I didn't receive this as I ordered take out, but there was a sign that said \"free chips and salsa for dine in customers\"."}
{"text":"Awful!!!! Will not be going back!!  

I'm a pretty relaxed, forgiving person until you do something thats industry unforgivable.  Like making a table wait for an hour... at a fast food place for their food. BAM!! DONE! NEVER GOING TO GO BACK! You do have the option of sitting down, but even the people getting their orders to go were waiting 30+ minutes.

And with all of the other AWESOME mexican places around.... what the heck??  An hour... a true 60 minute hour. AND the worst part... we were not the only ones who waited a LONG time for the mediocre food. In fact, the entire place... EVERY SINGLE TABLE(~10) were full. It took 10-15 minutes just to get our drinks which were diet cokes... you have a soda fountain, just take the order, fill the drinks and let the people sit with their drinks.  And when they did serve food, it was one plate at a time... took a good 5 minutes in between when I and my boyfriend received our food. 

I place every other mexican food restaurant, including taco bell, in the phoenix metro area, ABOVE this place. It cost $19.20 for a two taco combo(2 tacos- street style with rice & beans) and a taco and tamale combo(taco, tamle + rice & beans). ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? And the beans... AS RUNNY AS WATER!!! So gross!!!  I tried to mix my rice/beans together but that didn't help anything.

We went here on the recommendation two friends of ours... both are older... probably don't like as much spice and flavor as we do but the burnt meat in the El pastor tacos- unacceptable. BLACK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MEAT. The tamale tasted like it had cinnamon or allspice in it too.... totally not mexican and very gross! My reccomendation, go to Los Favoritos."}
{"text":"Ironically, I did not order the tacos, even though that is my staple choice at a new Mexican restaurant. Instead, I opted for a chicken, bean and rice burrito. It wasn't half bad! I added lots of the hot sauce and thought the overall consistency was great. The chicken was tender and flavors tasted fresh. My gf was not overjoyed with her Chimichanga meal, which was rather sloppy and wet. It had some crispy parts, but just wasn't up to her standards. She agreed the burrito was much better.

Our carry out order included several chips (6-7) and sauces. We ate some of the spicy carrots while we waited, which were ok. For being a hole in the wall Mexican place with a funny name, I liked it."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot and enjoy the made-to-order food. It's authentic Mexican, and a family-run small business. The owner does most of the cooking. When he recognizes a regular, he always peeks thru the kitchen window to wave.

They substitute without fuss or charges. They also have bottled Mexican Coke, Fanta, and others, in addition to Capri Sun, Gatorade, and fountain drinks. 

Free chips and salsa if you dine in. Not for carryout, which is a bummer if you are in a hurry.

2 bad things - it's so popular, often it's hard to find a place to sit...and the tables are picnic table-esque, so one size fits all. Also, if you pay with a card, they charge a fee."}
{"text":"One word YUMMY.  loved the rice and beans tasted home made.  Great service.  They even have diet coke.  CarnAsada tacos very good.  nice and fresh. The salsa and chips comes if you order dinner.  Really good slightly salty but it is mexican food.  They brought out green and red hot sauce for the tacos.  Which excited me but neither of them had anything amazing.  But I like spicy and it was mild.  Not saying bad just that I expected them to knock my shoes off because everything else about this place did. I have a feeling there are a few other menu items to try that would make me want to give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"WE LOVE ThiS PLACE!!!! It's such a hidden little gem. Salsa is wayyyy so delicious! The kids that run in are so kind and friendly. For us it's a weekly trip here. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food, it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that, I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"These guys quite literally have the best Mexican food for the price in the East Valley.  It is always clean, the portions are fair, but my God their food is delicious.  They have the best enchiladas I've had anywhere.  I have to say that anytime I drive by that place my mouth waters.  They actually cook their food and although it's a cheap Mexican place, the food is equally good or better than many of the upscale Mexican restaurants.  They have their own recipes for their sauces, and have the best red sauce I've ever tasted on enchiladas.  I crave them and think about them all the time.  Their chips and salsa are great, which are free if you choose to eat there, just not for takeout, which kinda sucks, but it is good too.
Over the past maybe year to two years that I have eaten there I have found that they are typically pretty nice.  There was a guy working there are Christmas Eve last year and he was nice.  He'd always be cool whenever I would come in.  They got some big bootied young girl who was rude as hell, but I go for the food so I won't stop going in there to eat.
What really sucks is their location is next the Goodwill at Ray & Alma, to the left of the Goodwill, sandwiched next to another restaurant and like an American Legion VFW bar lodge thing.  Because of the location, I don't think many people stop there because it is not easily visible from the street.
These guys have the best Mexican food out there though.  They are inexpensive, usually generous with the portions, and clean.  They are the opposite of Filiberto's on cleanliness, which is a filthy place.  Mucho Taco is always spotless and never smells funny.  You don't have cooks back there who are dirty and sweaty and busy contaminating everything like what you see at Filiberto's.
It is very hard to find a place where you get perfect food every single time.  Each time I have Mucho Taco I am satiated and happy.  The food never settles weird in my stomach, and I have a very sensitive stomach.  I know that they do a good job of keeping their kitchen clean, and the quality of the food is good.  You can really taste the difference.
I would suggest trying the cheese enchilada combination plate, eat in, and try the different salsas with chips.  They are so so good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco shops.  Don't be fooled by the rough exterior as the inside is the inside is very clean and nicely decorated with colorful mexican tile.  You order from the counter and take a seat where the friendly staff will soon deliver fresh chips and very good salsa.  Your food will also be delivered on a real plate - not wrapped in paper or in a styrofoam box like many of the other area taco shops.  

The Al Pastor and Carnitas are top notch.  I usually go with Al Pastor tacos but sometimes like get Carnitas into the mix.  I'm normally not a huge fan of ceviche however I really enjoy Mucho Taco's ceviche tostada.  The beans are excellent and I've had a really good chicken soup here as well.  Other reviewers have mentioned the Horchata and I'm looking forward to trying that on my next visit.  According to the server all of the aguas frescas are made fresh on-site, so if you're looking for Horchata Ole! (or Orange Bang! for that matter) you'll have to try somewhere else.

Almost forgot to mention that the prices are very reasonable.  My only complaints with Mucho Taco are that the taquitos are a little small and that Al Pastor is not available in a burrito (only tacos and tortas).  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for cheap but tasty mexican food in a casual environment."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

I'm not sure what happened but this place wasn't nearly as great as our 1st few times here. Younger girl at register...not very nice, didn't know specifics about ingredients or menu items. Her mom ended up taking our order, just as unfriendly...not mean, just not customer service friendly. 
Food= they use lard, which is pork and gross af. The shredded beef tacos were ick because they add some sauce to the meat. Carne asada tacos are still amazing. 
They didn't have flan but they had it on the menu

Very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"I come here for one thing...


The grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.  
Believe me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.

Horchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story."}
{"text":"Let me say I can sometimes find myself being guilty of judging a book by its cover. In the case of Mucho Taco I quickly overlooked it due to location, location, location. Good thing my little girl is as adamant as I am when it comes to satisfying whats on the taste buds. I did a quick Yelp review look up and was pleasantly surprised by the overall reviews for this joint. Well, I'm not afraid of broadening my horizons. This place has a quaint old town Mexico feel to it. They even have Telemundo on the tele. What really caught my attention is the fact that this place was clean, not a dirty table in the joint. That can really set the mood and so far I'm smiling. 

Walked up and the girl working the counter was all smiles and quite frankly had the best attitude/customer service I've seen in a long time. You've got to take a moment to recognize and appreciate such things when you see it.

Lucky for me today's especial was a 2 taco plate with rice & beans. Just what my daughter loves. I gave her my American child's request for this and that added and removed and she accommodated with no fuss. Then it was time for the General to make an off the menu request. I wanted a chimichanga but I was feeling chorizo so how about combining the 2. No problemo here! The girl picked up the menu and explained with a picture how they make their chimmi's enchilada style and asked if that would be ok. Absolutely! Paid, the girl and found me a nice place to rest my dogs. A couple seconds after getting situated the young lady brought out chips and salsa. Now being a connoisseur of all things food I was up for the salsa challenge. Gotta say- this salsa is good! Thick, not runny & it had a pleasant little kick to it. Too bad food was ready so quickly because I wanted to beat down another helping. Taco's looked delicious and their was plenty of rice & beans, my little girl's order was perfect. Im regretting not posting a pic of my chimmi masterpiece. Presentation was wonderful! A good sized chimmi laid smothered in cheese and surrounded in red sauce. Could have used a little more sour cream & guac but I know this stuff is so rare around AZ that restaurants share it sparingly. now I'm being sarcastic! But all in all the flavor was delish! 

I'm so glad I have a Mexican restaurant to add to my list of happiness. This place will be getting a return visit from me and anyone else I can con into the ghetto. lol Keep an eye out amigo's because after a couple more visits to ensure I wasn't dreaming, I'll be moving my rating up a notch. This place is great!"}
{"text":"We like the food and.great service here. Breakfast burritos are my fave! They make them with just eggs, if you like. They taste fantastic--better than Filiberto's and Nico's.

They have various Caldos here (soup, in English)--my hubby likes that. you can't find caldo at many Mexican restaurants. 

Drinks: regular American fountain drinks, and also available are Mexican drinks (including fantas and Mexican Coke!! mmmmm)

Not a lot of seating, but there's usually not very many people eating in. The guy brings your food out and comes and clears dishes if it seems to be getting too crowded, too.  *and* bonus--my 1-yr old was getting angry about something--the guy magically appeared with a Capri Sun and it quieted my boy instantly! (I didn't even see that they had Capri Suns available ;))

 It's in the plaza near Goodwill on corner of Alma School and Ray.  Give them a try if you have a hankerin' for Mexican."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Mexican joint, this is a pretty great choice. The service was great, the staff was friendly and the food was super tasty! They even had the nondescript red and green hot sauces, a sign of any great authentic Mexican restaurant.

When you order, they bring your drinks out to you once you sit down, along with some chips and fresh salsa. They also sell soda imported from Mexico, made with real cane sugar! You haven't had a Coke until you've had one made with real sugar, let me assure you.

I went with the chicken fajitas. The food came out very hot, the tortillas were quite warm and it was all very good. The chicken was some of the most tender chicken I've ever had, no joke. It was seasoned really well and was just amazing. My girlfriend got the carnitas burro and was very happy with it, but she agreed the chicken is where it's at.

When we went in, it was about an hour to close, so the place was mostly dead, which may be why our service was so good. But, they seemed to genuinely want to make their customers happy, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the same level of service when it's busy either."}
{"text":"Great place!  Amazing service and very tasty food.  Some plates do not have mega portions if that's what you're looking for, but I always leave feeling filled.  I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for some authentic Mexican food!  Muy delicioso!!"}
{"text":"I had driven by this place for a long time due only to it's choice of name and location - I thought \"Mucho Taco in a strip mall, how good could that really be?\" A friend of mine recommended, so I suggested to my Pops and we checked it out on a weekend menudo outing. I was very pleasantly surprised.

That was some time ago - it is now our normal Mexican food choice. We have not gotten too adventurous (as have some other reviewers) but I can attest to the deliciousness of the menudo (red), carnitas, carne asada, caldo de res and caldo de pollo. The churro's are always fresh and piping hot! I love the Limonada too.

As others have mentioned - great staff - you will likely see the owner  working here. They are always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere - it's a real small place with no frills."}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos El Pastor and Fresh tasty salsa.   Speedy friendly service.  The space is clean, decently and appropriately decorated and laid out well for a small space."}
{"text":"Been dining here for years. Proudly owned and managed by a wonderful family. Pride of ownership shows in the service, cleanliness, and quality of the food. It's our go to place when we want good food in a hurry. Very reasonable as well"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 12 years and everything tastes great.  Good for kids too as you can order a la cart beans and rice with a tortilla and my kids were happy!!  Good salsa and recently they added Mexican Popsicles that are so yummy!!! Reasonable prices and clean too!!!  One of our families favorite places.  Nothing fancy just great food!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and the food is pretty good.  We got 3 different burritos.  My husband didn't want anything, so the kids and I cut the burritos into 3 and I got to taste each burrito.

Each were really yummy.  I think one was a chili relleno, another carne asada, and chorizo and egg.  Each burrito was $4.95.  They weren't gigantic burritos like Filiberto's, but they were a good size.  

It took them awhile to make them, but well worth the wait.  The place was nice and clean and no real issues."}
{"text":"Always Fresh and Delicious! Have been coming here for years and never disappointed. The Tortas rock! Clean. Fast. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Had the shrimp and pastor. Both were delicious and fresh. Reasonably priced with free chips and salsa which were also very good. The homemade hot sauces and lime were a nice accompaniment.

My fellow diner was disappointed by the smaller size of the tacos, but I thought they were just fine for the price. Only wish I could have had a margarita with my meal. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"Hello... The Taste is fabulous as close as to my gmas home cooking as it gets. It's normally 1 server 1 cook but I think they should invest a little more into their staff I'm sure the customers would appreciate it and that delicious food would just keep on yielding profits!! Great food but I gave it a 3 cuz that poor girl works her butt off and it's not fair."}
{"text":"I tried this place for a late lunch today and all I can say it was very bland. The staff was great but the food....well not so much."}
{"text":"I really wanted horchata, so when my boyfriend and I were driving around for lunch, I searched on Yelp for a Mexican restaurant and decided on this place. The man behind the counter was nice and just said to let him know when I was ready to order, since I was still waiting for my bf to come inside. I decided on the chicken enchiladas and horchata, and my bf got a burrito. The chips and salsa they brought out before were tasty, and my horchata was good was well (free refills if you get a large!). My enchiladas were okay, but my boyfriend devoured his burrito and said it was really good, so I guess I'll have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Great place.  nice ppl.  a little pricey but worth it.  chicken enchiladas were great.  rice and beans great as well.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Free chips and salsa with every order. Probably the best salsa I've ever had. The al pastor is also great, and the carne asada, too. Probably my favorite Mexican place in Arizona so far."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been coming here for some years now and I never leave disappointed. It's definitely a mom and pop restaurant with delicious tacos de asada, tripas, y cabeza. Their menudo is also delicious. Definitely a place you need to try!"}
{"text":"Been coming to much taco for about 12 years, it's my favorite place for a carne asada burrito. The free chips and salsa are fresh and delicious. I usually get the lime juice when they have it, but their horchata is good too."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Great street tacos, salsa and service. Perfect Taco shop. Enchilada sauce and beans were very authentic. Loved the rice. Soft and flavorful."}
{"text":"I love the carne asada burritos from here! Also if you eat in, you get free chips and salsa. However, if you want to order more it's 99cents. Plan on spending he 99cents, the chips as salsa are addictive!!  I always want to try more of their menu, but how can I not get the carne asada burrito?! Next time I'll have to come here with more people so we can share more items."}
{"text":"Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.5 stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly.

Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes 5 minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp.

I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the \"L\" word here.  That's right, old school cookin' for better or worse; Lard."}
{"text":"Get steak burrito!!! Coz I like spicy, so just have to add hot sauce..
Yum!!

Note: don't have chance to try other stuffs tho.. can't get away from their steak.."}
{"text":"We love Mucho taco!! The owner is great and always makes sure to take care of us when we stop in. The mole chicken special is our favorite! This place is a small authentic restaurant but delivers a huge explosion of mexican flavor!!"}
{"text":"The burritos are delicious because of the homemade goodness inside of them, however, they're significantly smaller and more expensive than other Mexican joints. The Red chili is amazing and always fresh. Service is top-notch, and the store is always clean."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed. I ordered the green chile pork plant. Was extremely bland and skimpy. It didn't even taste or look like pork to be honest. I think they used chicken. I had to used a bunch of salt, lime and salsa to even make it take remotely good. I asked for two side beans but only looked like one. There was barely even me on my plate the whole thing was just covered in sauce. This used to be one of my favorite places to go but lately they have just been slacking on their quality of food. I don't think I will be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"I was a hankering some Mexican food, basic fare ya know!  Well, YELP listed Mucho Taco...so why not!  My first impression walking the through the door was somewhat mixed.  The tables were all stacked with dirty plates with the exception of one table.  Now, one could suppose they had a busy lunch time and the food is good, or not.  I chose to think it was good food and a busy location.

I placed my order and was provided chips and salsa to snack on while waiting for my meal.  My dish arrived shortly and the food was OK, nothing memorable as I cannot even remember what I ordered.  What does stand out is the counter help was cleaning the tables and the following was observed.

My first few bites were OK, nothing special except for the hair in the salsa bowl.  Maybe a forgone warning!  I asked for another salsa bowl before my observations noted below.   As I sat there the counter help was cleaning the tables with a dish rag which we see and most likely do at home, right?  Except the food debris she swept off the table was landing onto the seated benches, large chips, small chips and whatever else was very noticeable.  She neither cleaned the benches or attempted to pick up the large food debris from the seated areas.

The green and red sauce bottles were collected and placed on the servers counter along with what perceivably was a full bowl of salsa as she cleaned the tables.  Other salsa bowls collected from the tables were taken to the kitchen along with the dirty dishes. The green and red sauce bottles along with the full bowl of salsa was taken back to the kitchen...follow me, the full bowl of salsa on the table was most likely placed back into a larger vat for reuse later to other customers....if not, then why separate this one salsa bowl and place with green and red sauce bottles??

So, I said all that to say this...

YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN...I WON'T BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos. It looks dead and small but the food is awesome!! I'm here visiting and loved this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Small burritos. Decent flavors. Nothing too special. On par or just below something like Filibertos"}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay. I would not visit it again. The service was fast and friendly. But the flavor was not there and very bland. The location just looks suspect and just not what I was expecting. I've had some excellent Mexican food across the Valley and unfortunately there was nothing here that would cause me to return. I had the chimichanga and guacamole. The chimichanga was not cooked well enough and the dough was still pretty doughy inside. The guacamole was simple with no flavor. My husband had a shrimp soup that he liked but it was just okay to me."}
{"text":"I drove from the Ahwatukee, West Chandler area for 12 minutes to check this little place out. I was wanting to eat real street tacos and there is none of those in Ahwatukee or West Chandler only in Phoenix, Mesa and stuff like that.  Well,  I LOVED THIS LITTLE PLACE, nothing fancy, simple, good service, free chips and salsa.  Street tacos are amazing (soft tacos)   I'm coming back again."}
{"text":"It's just about time I right a review for this place!!!
Been coming for years it is always excellent.  
The enchilada sauce is fantastic."}
{"text":"My favorite place so far for a breakfast burrito. Tasty and not greasy at all. Looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Hoping for an indigenous Mexican food experience ( having read so on Yelp) I trundled to this place (which is next to iMart, A thai restaurant and a newly opened \"Deshi snack food store\".

Service: Good and very friendly. I got the salsa/chips and the verde /roja spicy sauce for my taco served t me. I also got the medium Jamaica (even though I paid for the small). I also helped myself to their pickled Carrot and Serrano peppers (mmmm Spicy.. though I prefer the grilled peppers from Senor taco) 

Food: I chose to order the more adventurous Tripe, head and Shrimp tacos. 
Tripe: Rather gamey and had a smell like the cow was having a bad day when it got chosen to be eaten
Head: Interesting taste and smell (tasted a lot like a slightly off Carne asada). I was expecting portions of brain as well (but maybe after Bovine Spongi..what not,  its probably safer that I didn't)
Shrimp: Bit overdone (hence rubbery) but with a good griil aroma and flavor.

Authenticity: Definitely 

Net Impression: Will go here again and order the more traditional fare. I'm leaning towards the mole to make my final decision. As always Mom and Pop authentic stores always has a soft corner for me."}
{"text":"After eating here since the beginnings of this place - I will NOT be back. I should have noticed how the restaurant was practically empty. The prices are INSANE!! Everything has gone up 3 or more dollars and they charge xtra for salsa on TOGO's. I asked for salsa for my taco and she told me it was extra. Too many other Mexican restaurants to put up with overpriced and rude! Bye!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fajitas in the valley!!!! Amazing! Also their fresh homemade salsa cannot be beat."}
{"text":"First time here, but definitely not the last! The tortillas are homemade and so delicious! The tacos are so good they will break your mouth! The carne asada burrito is filled with meat. A small little mom and pop restaurant, but they are the best! Authentic real deal!!"}
