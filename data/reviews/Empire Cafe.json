{"text":"Tried this place this morning.  I have been disappointed with some of the other places near this area for breakfast.  I was pleasantly surprised, tried their omelette, it was fresh and tasted great.   There coffee was much better than the diner I have been getting breakfast at.

Food was served quick and the place was clean and had a huge tv to catch the morning news.  Prices were very reasonable.

I will be back."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I regularly order lunch from Empire Cafe and we love it! They make the ordering process very simple and deliver the food very quickly.

I have not disliked a single thing I have ordered so far. Breakfast sandwich, BLT, salad, the list goes on and on. It's all good. 

You get a very high quality meal at an extremely reasonable price, especially considering how much food you get."}
{"text":"Great place! To grab a fast lunch great food and exceptional service! If you are in the area you sould really stop by! My favorite dish was the salmon salad, good amount of fish for the price."}
{"text":"Seriously....i prefer to go to potbelly....for 1/2 the price.  I heard this place was awarded something, i can't imagine what.  The sandwich was meh....ok."}
{"text":"I work in the building next door, so decided to stop by for an afternoon snack. The main problem I had was poor customer service.

I walked up to the cashier and mentioned I was just here to get a snack. But the cashier was texting on her phone and didn't even respond. So I got one of their large cookies and a drink. She rang up the order, pushed the receipt in my direction to sign and immediately went back to texting on her phone.

I know it was mid afternoon and slow, but you'd think the employee could tear herself away from her phone for just a full minute and pretend to be friendly."}
{"text":"This place replaced a great little sandwich shop in an office complex.  I wish the other place could come back!  One morning I ordered a bagel (untoasted) and it was somehow moist and chewy.  No more Empire bagels for me!  I've gotten coffee there a few times, and both times they had their flavored coffee and regular coffee carafes mixed up so that if you wanted regular coffee you ended up with flavored coffee and vice versa.  I had a takeout salad from there for lunch one day when my employer ordered in lunch for us.  The salad was big and tasty, but I'm sensitive to preservatives and ended up with a raging headache by the end of the day.  I thought the chicken in my salad tasted a little salty as I ate it, so maybe it was the salad that gave me a headache, or maybe it was other things.  Either way, I'll bring my lunch next time if my employer wants to order from them again for convenience.  Now I walk across the street to Bruegger's Bagels if I want a quick sandwich or salad.  They have much better food and prices."}
{"text":"OK, we just had a lunch staff meeting and ordered from Empire Cafe. Again, they did not disappoint. We ordered about 8 sandwiches with sides and everything was delivered as ordered and on time. The sandwiches and salads were all very good. I personally loved the home made potato chips (and my \"Empire\" sandwich was delicious too!). The potato salad was \"everything you wanted potato salad to be\" per my co-worker. Everyone gave the Empire Cafe a thumbs up as far as whether or not to order from there again. I think that says it all!"}
{"text":"If you work in the Biltmore area, this is a great place to grab a quick bite.  The food is not terribly overpriced and is usually pretty tasty.  They sometimes get orders mixed up, but overall they do a pretty good job.  The breakfast burrito is probably the best thing on the menu.  You also can't go wrong at lunch with one of the melts or the chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Ok I confess I didn't physically in the restaurant, but they brought the kitchen to my work place. Holiday treat from the management of the business building. Three chefs made breakfast from scratch to accommodate the whole building which has four floors. I ordered the Denver Omelette and was delicious. Waffles, pancakes and drinks also served. What a great morning!"}
{"text":"They have a great lunch, the burgers are really good. Have been working in the area and have been their several times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm tired and hungry. I'm on my way home from a week in Baja Mexico. So I stop in to the Barrio Cafe in the Phoenix  Skyharbor airport at the D gates. I have to say that pork and green chili burrito (burro)  was the best Mexican food I had all week."}
{"text":"I work in the building and come down here for lunch sometimes, I love the portobello mushroom sandwich! The owner is super kind and gives back to his regular customers. The prices are pretty decent too. Try them for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I work in the same building and \"used\" to eat frequently - but after this week I'm not sure how often I will go back.  They either have their staff on holiday schedule but my food took almost 20 minutes yesterday and today they forgot the condiments to my meal.  I do have to say within the past 6 months their prices sky-rocketed and they fluctuate on a daily basis.  I like their breakfast and sometimes get ONE pancake - sometimes it will be $2 and sometimes it is $4 ... same food (no sides, no meat, just ONE pancake).  Sometimes my quesadilla is $4 and sometimes it is $6.50, again, same food (no sides, no meat ... just a Cheese quesadilla).  IDK, it's things like this that eventually drive away customers and makes it not worth going and eventually they will go out of business - like the little deli that used to be here in the building next door.  People aren't stupid ... give them crappy service, food and raise your prices ... it then becomes worth it to drive or walk to another place - just saying."}
{"text":"thats a negative 1. I had diarrhea for a week the virus was soo bad."}
{"text":"Just had a chicken quesadilla here that was super good! Staff is quite friendly and the cafe is very clean."}
{"text":"This little corner cafe mostly feeds the local offices surrounding it. I honestly was not expecting much from this place except convenience of its location, however, surprisingly it really has some great food! The staff is very friendly and typically the line moves pretty quick. A little pricy but worth it in my opinion. Nothing fancy- just good food."}
{"text":"I work near here and typically eat lunch here once each week. This place is a solid 4 star cafe. I enjoy their sandwiches, soups and chili. I've never been disappointed in their service or the quality of their food. They get pretty busy around noon and I see a ton of repeat customers who have a lot of other options just across the street. I think that's a pretty strong indicator that you can trust."}
{"text":"This place is convenient. That's mostly the reason why I come here.  Yes, the Biltmore is a walk across the street, but walking there and back is 15 minutes alone.  This place used to be housed in the middle courtyard under a tent while their brick  & mortar building was being constructed.  Once their restaurant opened, prices for items that used to be sold under the tent went up a couple of dollars - granted some of the sandwiches now come with a more variety of sides, it's still a steep hike.  During the lunch hour, it definitely gets busy - but not as busy as when it first opened.  The staff seems to still struggle a little as far as getting everything together - sometimes they are a bit slow.  But they definitely are friendly so that makes up for not getting mad for the slowness.  Anyhow, the sandwiches are pretty decent - the portabello, the pulled pork is pretty tasty.  Salads are big. They also have a daily special pasta station for $7.99 +tax.  You'll find that most of their items are $7.00 and up.  Again, glad this place is here for convenience."}
