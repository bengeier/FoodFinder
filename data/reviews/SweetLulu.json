In my 30min eating time, I saw 3 customers(already called and ordered their  food) came and left with anger!"}

It was Aug 22 and me and my friends just left CNE. We were from uptown and didn't really know many places to eat in downtown Ossington & Queen area. I suggested Rock Lobster but my friends didn't seem like interested (some dumb friends). We went into this restaurant just coz it seems modern and clean, hoping it will surprise us.

It was empty when we went in. Service was good. The male server was nice. I was holding a large Mcdee soft drink and I felt embarrassed that I had to bring it into the restaurant because I couldn't finish it before entering the place. The server didn't say a word and I didn't drink it just to respect the restaurant.

As for their menu, it only has one page. They have a few appetizers and we weren't interested in them at all. Besides their appetizers, they only have one main dish. It is like a pick-your-own-ingredients noodles / rice dish. Their menu is pretty boring unless they are good.

What's that main dish? So basically, you pick your meat (chicken/beef/shrimp) with vege. Then pick a kind of noodle / rice from a few selections. Then pick the soup base. Then pick the herbs. Like my friend said, it's like stir-fry. Oh, and we Hong Kong fobs DO NOT LIKE stir-fry. Because, no offense, it is just putting all the ingredients into a pan and fry till it's edible. Why paying for that outside? We wouldn't step into a stir-fry place unless someone point a gun at us.

I ordered a chicken with pad thai noodle in Laksa soup with all the herbs they have on the menu. The dish's appearance was quite pretty. Portion was fine for me, who don't really eat a lot usually. But it was definitely considered small to my other guy friends. Chicken was pretty stir-fry standard; dry and rubbery. Noodle was a tad hard but edible. Laksa soup was alright, not the best. Well, it simply tasted more like red curry soup. When I say \"alright\", I mean it is alright as in a soup base, but definitely not good in terms of a Laksa soup. Btw, I love Laksa and I didn't like this one.

Depends on what meat you choose, the prices are different despite what noodles/rice and soup and herbs sections you chose. I picked chicken so it was $10.95.

Honestly, I wasn't satisfied with my dish at this price. Again, I have to stress that we are fobs from Hong Kong and it feels like stir-fry to us. So we don't think it deserves $10.95. We are fine if it is only $8.95 max. Well, may be the price may seem fair to Canadian-Born-Chinese or Caucasians, not trying to be racist. We just know how cheap these ingredients literally are in reality and how simple they have to cook it.

Okay, it seems like I complained a lot of this restaurant. Actually, I tried my friend's green curry soup base and it was really good, despite the \"green curry\" was white in color. Well, I'm just talking about the soup is good. The price and the meat were still unacceptable to me.

My habit, I always pay a little more tips if I am not going there ever again.

PS. Funny when I told my mom about this dinner experience, she told me they had to charge that price because of its downtown location. I told her I understand and respect the owner's price decision. I'm just saying I won't pay that amount of money for what I got there again."}
