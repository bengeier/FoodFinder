{"text":"Needs improvement or it won't last. My hot dog bun was stale and hard as a rock. The hot dogs should be grilled. It would give them more flavor. The looked like they were boiled or steamed. The fries were soggy. There was a young man working the register who looks like he is a total slacker. He couldn't stand and work the register, he had to sit. Bad first impression. More attention to detail, please!!!"}
{"text":"It's just a hole in the wall across the street from Dairy Queen, but they have good dogs at excellent prices. On for $3 two for $5, all toppings included!!.  They also have hot sausage, meatballs, wing dings, and french fries. They are open mid-day and on weekends 7pm-3am is added. A young couple run it, and service is as fast a four hands can manage."}
