{"text":"I feel betrayed.  My second visit to Harlem Underground was a disaster, and I'd been talking it up to my dinner companion for weeks.  I actually feel embarrassed.  At first I thought maybe I'd just ordered wrong, but my friend had what I had on my first visit, fried chicken with waffles--the house specialty, and was distinctly unimpressed.  

I had the turkey meatloaf, feeling in the mood for something less egregiously unhealthy than fried chicken, and it was terrible.  Dry and bland and sort of chewy.  It was improved by a nice though small side of steamed spinach with a slightly sweet (maple syrupy?), buttery sauce, but that wasn't enough to rescue it.  

We both had a side of mac and cheese, me because they were out of sweet potato fries (odd, since earlier that afternoon I bought sweet potatoes at the grocery across the street).  It was not totally awful but it tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.

Two things rescued it from one star: the service and the red velvet cake, the latter of which I doubt was made anywhere near the premises and even a bit dry, but nonetheless authentic and delicious.  Thank you Liam, our charming and on the ball server.  I hope the lackluster food doesn't screw you out of the tips you deserve.

I'm eager to see what other reviewers have to say, because clearly my experiences are wildly inconsistent."}
{"text":"So just finished an early dinner at Harlem. I tried to go there for Winterlicious but they were always booked so I figured the food must be amazing and I would make it a point to go another time. The restaurant was empty. After 30 minutes the waitress realized they forgot to put our order in. Food was Luke warm when it arrived.  No explanation,  just sorry for the delay. 

Had the chicken and waffles, was decent but again not hot. Friend had the meat loaf which was a tad disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a group during winterlicious. It was one of the first places I tried chicken and waffles in the city. I recommend. Others at the table tried the fish and gumbo. Warm and inviting place."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing here. We tried the jerk chicken quesadillas, spring rolls, chicken and waffles, bacon Mac and cheese and deep fried pickles. In terms of food, I have no complaints whatsoever! However the environment....we were sorta a big group, 8 people. It definitely isn't made for large groups and we were put in this corner where the heater was. I understand its -20 outside, but it isn't -20 inside and the heat didn't need to be on that high! It felt like we were sitting in a sauna, which sorta doesn't make you hungry. However I would definitely go back, but I'd avoid the back corner."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, AWESOME! 

I've been wanting to try their chicken and waffles this whole summer and I finally got the chance to today! Went with my girl and we both had it and it was deeeeeeelicious! I don't know who came up with the idea of combining chicken and waffles but they've got some unique taste buds! It was definitely worth the wait. 

When we walked in, it was mid afternoon and completely empty except for one occupied table. We chose to sit out on the patio cause the weather permitted it. Menus are written out in the style of vinyl records and they serve breakfast/lunch till 3pm. The chicken and waffles is on the dinner menu as well but for almost $3 more. 

Our waitress was very friendly and the food came quick! Chicken was fried to crispy perfection and the waffles were SO fluffy! Served with syrup, a coriander and lime sauce, a sweet and spicy sauce. Served on the side was an orange slice and some greens. 

Delicious. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends and absolutely loved the atmosphere! I got the bbq jerk chicken and the Mac and cheese and an appetizer I can't remember the name of. I really enjoyed everything I got.Not sure if the food was really good or I was just really hungry
Anyways I thought it was a bit pricey for their menu but I'll probably return because I found out you can add bacon to the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Went to Harlem for drinks on a casual night. I found the staff amazing - always interacting with myself and my guest and asking specificities about how we liked our drinks. The server was attentive, and the live music was incredible. I would definitely recommend the patio for those looking to have an in depth conversation, but the main restaurant would be good to enjoy to the music over a drink and some food."}
{"text":"This was the first stop on my tour of Winterlicious.  I had a little trouble finding the restaurant as it was at night and like most places in Toronto not very well lit.  Regardless, we did find it and managed to get a parking spot close to the restaurant right on Queen W (which sometimes a tricky thing to do).

I was coming from out of town and had a reservation made.  Due to traffic and the trouble finding the place needless to say I was a bit late.  When we walked in I immediately liked the atmosphere.  We were greeted and seated quickly.  As much as I enjoyed the atmosphere the seating could use an overhaul.  We were seated right beside two other diners and the seating is so close together we felt like we were unable to have a normal conversation.  We had to whisper so the other diners did not hear what we were talking about and we had to whisper so we wouldn't annoy them.  The other diners actually got quiet as well no sooner than we were seated.  To say the least this put a damper on the conversation for the night.  I had asked if we could move tables to a window seat further down but was told no as the table was reserved.  That table remained empty throughout the night until we were leaving and then someone came to occupy it.  So wasn't really impressed with that.

Regardless, the service was exceptional.  Once we settled into our table our waitress immediately came and took our drink orders and gave us the menus.  We got both the Winterlicious menu and their regular menu (which I think their regular menu is cool as it is on an old vinyl record).  We had ordered the Mandarin Spinach Salad, Southern Fried Chicken & Waffles and the Almond Chocolate Kisses.  Our food came quickly and was absolutely delicious.  The sauces that came with the fried chicken were so good (especially the spicy one) and the waffles were light and fluffy.  I was a little disappointed with dessert as I expected something different.  (I was expecting by the description more of a cake like dessert).  The dessert was a slightly larger than normal cookie with a fudge like consistency.  But the fried chicken oh boy!  Delicious!

The service was fast, friendly and professional.  I was extremely impressed with the service I received.

The bathroom is in the basement and was extremely cold.  I felt like I was going to the washroom outside lol.  A nice warm restaurant upstairs and a freezing cold basement bathroom.  I would suggest that they make sure they heat the basement as well and install some extra lighting as it was quite dark down there as well.  The stairs are steep and not well lit either.

*Warning* When we received our bill and were about to pay my friend noticed that the had already included gratuity in our bill.  If she had not noticed that we would have double tipped them.  I understand that with Winterlicious some restaurants do include gratuity but I wish they would have told us.  I almost felt like it was a sneaky move to get more money.

So other than the couple of bumps experienced at the restaurant we did enjoy our experience and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"The last time we were heading to Harlem Underground, we ended up walking past Squirley's and went there instead. 

Oh, how I wish we had made that choice this time around.

This experience is purely based on their eggs benny. The service is good, the people are nice.  But that whole waffle underneath the eggs thing, its just two flavours that don't belong together in my opinion. 

Especially on a hangover, looking for sustenance, something to cure the headache and stomach blues, and then having a disappointing brunch/breakfast...its so...disappointing.

Queen Street needs Stem back.  Oh god how I miss Stem."}
{"text":"I ordered take out - Fried Chicken and Rice + Coleslaw (what the sign outside said) with a side of Mac & cheese.
Waitress said it would take 10-15 minutes but it took about 25-30 minutes.
They give you a decent portion of chicken but a horrible portion of rice. I did not get the coleslaw that was advertised with the 'special'. Instead I got a couple of red pepper slices in my rice, which was also bland..um okay.

The chicken was very bland and I'm sad to say KFC has more flavor. The gravy it was made it decent to add a 'kick' to it.

It was quite expensive and came out to $25.

I really enjoyed the Mac and Cheese. I was looking forward to it but was disappointed."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for a late lunch and was able to get the southern fried chicken and waffles from the dinner menu (they were very nice to let me :-P). Loved it. Good service. Good ambiance. We enjoyed the  spring rolls as a starter as well. The wife had the chicken curry and was quite satisfied."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than Harlem underground...  

The food, service and drinks (Rum punch) are all to die for.  I have tried just about everything on the menu.. and each tim I am pleasantly surprised with combination of flavours and spices, it it honestly an experience like no other.

When friends are in from out of town and want a real local experience this is the #1 place on my list. 

 Definitely check it out and say Ricardo sent you..."}
{"text":"Of course we went for the chicken and waffles. I don't like reviewing restaurants for brunch cause its hard to shine I think but anyhow here it is. 

The chicken and waffles was pretty good. Crispy outside, juicy inside, seasoned ok. The waffles were too gooey for me. I prefer a crispier waffle on the outside. The sauces were preeeettty delicious. The scotch bonnet syrup was really good. 

We also had the poached eggs and collard greens with some potatoes. The potatoes felt like they had French toast batter on them which was ok. It was a basic breakfast nothing special. 

The service was really good and atmosphere was cute but we were the only people in the restaurant so that always weirds me out a bit. 

I'd go back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Meh...
Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich was seriously lacking... clearly the dude in the kitchen has never actually eaten a smoked meat sandwich in Montreal...

Fish and Chips however... amazing."}
{"text":"Music was really bad, but the food was quite good, and prices reasonable. I'll definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. You will die of starvation before you get food. We were told \"stop ordering drinks so we can cook your food \".  wtf says that lol. Took 1.5 hr for our meals to arrive."}
{"text":"similar to a lot of other reviewers, i really wanted to like this place.  also as per previous comments, i thought the entranceway drapes were charming, the overall dimly lit atmosphere was great, and the bathrooms were very well kept! all of this, combined with my lovely company actually kept me from saying or writing anything negative about the place.  however,  i can stay silent no more! a restaurant, afterall, is about THE FOOD...and...and....ugh. bleh.

my friend had a salad and the mac and cheese.  i didn't say anything to her at the time, but isweartogod it was a heated frozen entrée like this:
http://heateatreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/MCMacaroniCheese.jpg
the texture of the pasta and the taste of the sauce was so exactly reminiscent that i dont know how else one would replicate it. so beyond wrong and disappointing to be served that in a restaurant.


i had the chicken and waffles. 
the chicken was extremely, overly fried (again, as someone else mentioned...maybe pre-fried and fried again before serving??)...the coating fell off when prodded with a fork or knife or..mouth.  hardly any chicken on the bones. blech. the waffles were dry and cold.  the maple syrup was maple syrup...did not taste any coriander or lime...two flavours which would be hard to miss.  the gravy was also cold..and tasted like something straight from a can...(franco american mushroom gravy?! http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/c/0/0/103/6/AAAADDLg2GYAAAAAAQNgfQ.jpg?v=1289179942000).

anyway...im glad my friend is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch twice on a Sunday morning.  The waitresses are very friendly but hardly prompt.  The place has a nice vibe to it.  A relaxed, comfortable atmosphere.  

We ordered the blueberry buttermilk pancakes, the Harlem French toast and a Caesar. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and the blueberry syrup was delicious. The French toast is stuffed with rum soaked raisins cream cheese, the portions was large. The Caesar was OK, but not spectacular.

I'd go back to try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Thanksbeto BlogTO, I have found yet *another* stupendously delicious spot in which to gorge on brunch. 

The Harlem Underground is housed in the space occupied by the formerly named Irie. Despite having passed Irie about a billion times, it just never looked very inviting, so when I saw that they mixed things up a bit, I thought I'd give it a try. A new interior and a new menu has apparently done wonders for Harlem Underground. 

My interest was piqued when I saw that they served \"soul food\", which I also consider \"southern food\". Being from the American South, I miss what I consider \"home\" or \"comfort\" foods, which would include pretty much everything on the Harlem Underground menu. Their brunch includes such southern delights as Sweet Potato Waffles, Crawfish Etouffee, Frog Legs, and pecan-covered French Toast. I chose the Harlem Benny, which, despite its name, isn't your traditional eggs benedict. Rather, instead of english muffins, HU serves the perfectly cooked poached eggs over a thin sweet potato pancake that's covered with sausage and grits (!). A cheesy hollaindaise is served on the side for dipping or pouring. Also served on the plate was the most delicious side salad EVAR -- baby greens, pear, red and yellow peppers, and pomegranate seeds!

As per usual, I ordered a half order of the French Toast and asked them to surprise me with which one. They were more than accommodating and immediately said \"sure, we can do that -- is $2 fair?\".  

Overal;, the food was fabulous -- very well flavoured, temperature-appropriate, and plentiful. I had a latte with brunch and it was also very good. 

Service was exceptional -- friendly, attentive, and not overly \"in your face\". 

I took a glance at the dinner menu and it looked equally appealing. I will definitely go back to the Harlem Underground -- I just hope it's as good the second time around!

Note: there are two locations -- one on Richmond East and this one on Queen West."}
{"text":"It was Sunday evening and they had a DJ blasting music louder than any club I've been in. It was insane.

From the unfriendly staff when I entered the restaurant to the bland fried chicken, this was the  worst dining experience I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food isn't terrible (I got the eggs Benedict with cornbread), but being from the U.S. it's not really authentic (obviously!!!); it's more so a fusion of soul food meets Caribbean food just thrown together. The name itself threw me off (Harlem is in the North NOT the deep South). A good litmus test is to always try the mac and cheese. The cheese was literally non-existent! Just because someone puts a little dish in the oven with a little bit of cheese on top of to make it look pretty DOES NOT turn it magically into mac and cheese. 

Honestly, if ya'll want some decent mac and cheese, you're better off going to the Evergreen Brick Works restaurant (I would say they have some good mac and cheese for sure). And just to keep it real, there was hardly any black folk up in there (another good indicator). The food could MOST DEFINITELY be better even though it's not truly authentic.

The service was pretty bad too. Our waiter kept forgetting our drink orders and a side order. However, he did show some remorse so I still gave a pretty decent tip. I didn't want to eat there in the first place, but my friend wanted to try it. But, I most certainly will never return!!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving for fried chicken and waffles so my boyfriend and i stopped by Harlem over the weekend for brunch... i made reservations because i read on yelp that it is often packed... when i got there... we were the only ones, then 2 more couples came in... that was it on a saturday at 1pm. 

As recommended, we ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Waffles and Omeleted du Jour. The food looks nice and well presented, and they had a few sauces in little cups as well... but after the tasting, i gotta say it was a disappointment. i dont know what it is, but the fried chicken and the waffles would be better off in two different dishes. The chicken wasn't very marinated/seasoned... it didn't really have alot of taste, and it was a little dry... the waffles were alright.. not the best ones i've had and not something i would remember... my boyfriend had the omelette... it was somewhat better than my dish but again, this restaurant is not something i will remember. the coffee we had was very watery... and to be honest, the black mugs... were not very clean.. it looks like some old cottage mug that everyone has been using... i think they should get new mugs because it didn't look very appetizing when the first thing i had was the coffee... oh also the cornbread that everyone is crazy about... not my favorite thing, it was quite dry and crusty... i took one bit and the whole thing fell apart, it was quite messy.

overall it was a very nice place, great atmosphere and the place had some nice decors as well... but food-wise, i dont think i will come back.. 

ps. the waitresses were friendly and had really good fashion sense."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious.  After completely ignoring us for most of the night and forgetting about some of the orders, the food was sub par and nothing to brag about. Their rum punch pitchers seem to lack any rum.  Although the chicken and waffles is good, all of our other dishes were very disappointing.  And don't bother ordering dessert."}
{"text":"I had Roscoe's chicken and waffles when I was in L.A and ever since then I've been looking for a place like this inToronto.  Let me begin my saying this place is not it...

Ate here over the weekend to try their \"famous\" chicken and waffles as it was rated no.1 in Yelp and No. 2 in BlogTO.  I also brought some friends along to enjoy brunch and rave how good the reviews were for this place - we were sadly disappointed.  

The menu were a nice touch, although my friend had a different menu than the rest of us.  The prices didn't corresponded so we didn't know which menu had the right price.  The service was slow, the guy never came back to refill our coffee even though I saw him notice that our cups were empty.  None the less, we decided to share the plantain for app... it was soggy and not what we expected.  

So we moved on and all four of us ordered their  chicken and waffles ($14).  Before our food arrived, I couldn't help but notice the waitress pouring Aunt Jemima syrup into a plastic cup.  Sure enough that was for our waffles.  For a place like this, I expected a homemade syrup or at least don't put it on the counter in plain sight or transfer it in another container for god's sake! it just ruins it for everyone.    

The chicken was way too oily, how oily? lets just say I didn't have to reapply my lip gloss for the afternoon.  The presentation was good, the food was not.  I've been apologizing to my mates for this one."}
{"text":"I sampled the Jambalaya and the Harlem crisps appetizers. If you don't mind dropping $100 on food, drink and having average uninspiring food and not particularly attentive service, you might like it here. The menu reads great - and the fried chicken looked good but the Harlem crisps did not come with avocado but instead had chick pea paste that was tasteless and looked unappealing(vomit) and was a waste of $7. The Jambalaya was served hot, which I value but after that, it was pretty disappointing at $20 a bowl. I found a shrimp tail - no shrimp attached - and the ingredients were all there yet nothing stood out. Another guest had the same dish and more or less agreed.

The service was ok for drinks, but the waiter had no clue what dishes went where and handed them to us - we weren't served. Well meaning but not experienced in service is how I would describe it. Considering there were 8 of us spending about $100 per couple and the 15% gratuity was added automatically one would hope for table service.

Great menu - very disappointing. Maybe stick with the chicken."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a meal at Harlem Underground for quite sometime after reading a few reviews about the place, but it was never open for lunch. 

Finally, I persuaded my boyfriend and friend to come try this Southern cuisine place one night. 

There had been a couple mistakes with the orders, but they were promptly and politely corrected. 

Overall, some of the food was a tad over fatty for such a humid day. However, the flavour fit the atmosphere very well and everything was amazing in taste. I would definitely return and recommend to anybody up for heartwarming meal with friends."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  The location is dear to my heart and the constant turn-over of places at King and Tecumseth has been a sad site to see.  Unfortunately, I have little to no hope for Harlem.  The best thing I could say about the spot was that the music was fun. 
I ordered the blueberry pancakes.  Usually I expect some blueberry IN the pancakes, instead all I got was extra-buttery cakes with some blueberry jam on the side.  They also came along with my ultimate pet-peeve: fake flavourless maple syrup.  We live in Canada, the sugar shacks were just in full force last month. There is NO excuse for cheaping out on maple syrup. 
I'd keep on with the whining, but no one's meal was anymore memorable.  My recommendation, if you're looking for good greasy spoon, keep heading east to Shanghai Cowgirl. Or for something classy try Rosebud Grill or Czechoski's for some yummy brunch."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch Had the vegi omelette, home fries, and sangria the food was good.they also had a DJ playing music which was a nice touch to Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"It's forcing me to give it 1 star but I would give it zero stars if I could. Poor service, no flavour, took 45 mins to get a glass of water."}
{"text":"I personally loved the way the restaurant is set up! The decor, music and vibe fits so well with it's name \"Harlem Underground.\" 

The food was also great, and fit the \"soul food\" theme. I ordered the chicken and waffles with Bacon Mac and Cheese on the side, and it was DELICIOUS.

{"text":"Came here on Friday to surprise a friend for her birthday, 3 words: southern fried chicken!"}
{"text":"3.75 stars... ahhh if only you could give partial stars

I've been wanting to come to HU for a while, so it was great that my friends agreed to go when we randomly walked by it.  We ended up having a wonderful time.

The staff is friendly, and you know you're going to have a fun time the moment you walk into the restaurant.

I had the jambalaya and an order of corn bread.  The bread was such a great starter, and a welcome change to regular bread rolls and butter you get at every other restaurant.  My jambalaya had a great kick, and it was packed with meaty goodness!  My only SMALL complaint about the dish is that some of the fish seemed overdone and became gummy.  It didn't leave a nice taste, but the rest of the dish made up for it.

I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken. Exactly what I was looking for. I had mine to go but really dug what I saw of the vibe while I waited. My exact thought as I was passing the time with the menu: my fiancée and I need to come here together sometime, everything on this menu looks amazing and the patio out back is calling our name."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food as it it not bad.

Horrible service, the staff were unapologetic for the delay and 15% gratuity is totally not worth it for the service.

They took a whole two hours to get the food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here last night for some Monday night jazz! There was an incredible band playing and apparently they are here every Monday night. Outstanding musicianship - I wish I had gotten their name.

The bar itself was comfortable and had a good fun atmosphere. I was also really impressed with the sound quality despite small size of the place. Loved how the bar and the area the band were playing in backed out onto the street. 

Drinks were average priced. The service was very slow but the servers were so friendly it didn't really matter.

Would like to come here for food sometime as they had some very tasty options on their menu!"}
{"text":"You know those blind dates you get set up for? Your date shows up, she's kind of pretty, has a nice body and a decent smile? Then you get talking and find out she shares your fave colour and music, and you think \"alright! this might be it!\" Chatting continues and then you find out she's totally whack in serious matters like politics, food, and humour and she has crappy bedside manners? That be Harlem Underground.

After reading some great Yelp reviews, I trekked out to Queen West and was greeted by a funky atmosphere and a super friendly, chill server. The menus were hip (like a record) and the content sounded delicious.

Fast forward 20 minutes of waiting for food (and being tempted by the mac-and-cheese at the table next to me in the meantime, and thus ordering one for myself), I finally met the Nice Lady (aka my wrap). The first bite was delicious but it got progressively worse as I couldnt find the other ingredients such as plantain, and all I could taste was the goat cheese. Bleh, Too much for me! My girlfriend got the Harlem sandwich with black forest ham, jerk chicken and havarti. I thought this was deeeelicious (minus the triple decker bread) but she found the spice of the jerk chicken too much. So, all you Weak Spices, stay away. Lastly, please don't be a fool like me and get suckered into the mac-and-cheese. You could probably make a better KD.

Shit really went downhill after this as the swarm of fruitflies over us became unbearable as we waited 20 or so minutes for our server. Such a sweet guy, but a really untimely smoke break.

Too bad. It all started so good. Maybe will try again some other time when fruitflies go extinct.

Atmosphere - 4/5 if it werent for the flies. minus a billion points. 
Service - 2.5/5
Food - 2.5/5
Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for Summerlicious and had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. We made reservations in advance which were messed up multiple times by the staff - should have been a tip-off in my opinion. We showed up, waited at the door for quite some time before we were greeted. We requested to sit at the back but they told us it was full. Mere moments after they seated us in the front, they sat a table of 4 at the back. At this point, I was trying hard to not be judgmental.
After waiting for about 10 minutes, the server came over to ask about drinks. It was a very, very hot evening and my entire party was parched so we requested water. The waiter - a twenty-something girl with dark hair - pushed us to purchase alcohol. As a group, we resisted and requested the water again. Needless to say, it took 10 more minutes to arrive and came in the smallest cups I have ever seen at a restaurant. Being very thirsty, most of us finished drinking our glasses in two sips so we obviously wanted more. Throughout the meal, they only refilled our glasses three times. We requested refills upwards of 10 times from multiple staff. At one point, after begging the busboy, he promised to go tell our waitress. I watched him walk over and tell her. She looked at our table and did nothing but stand at the bar. After about 10 minutes, we flagged down a third staff member who finally refilled our glasses. As he was doing it, she walked over to our table and said, \"Oh great, you got some water.\" I was flabbergasted.
The entire meal went this way. My cornbread took 25 minutes to arrive which would have been understandable if it weren't cold when it arrived. It's impossible for me to even describe the quality of the food because the service was so unbelievable - it wrecked my appetite. We asked for our bill as our dessert arrived and it still took over 20 minutes to appear. The whole meal ended up taking two and a half hours which was completely unacceptable.
Our waitress sent over another staff member to deal with our bills (most likely knowing what would happen) and for the first time in my entire restaurant experience - I didn't tip and neither did anyone else in my party. When I asked for change, the waiter was outraged. Another person in my party gave two twenties for a $28 bill and the same waiter asked him multiple times if he was sure he wanted change. A 45% tip for that meal? Is that a joke?
Please save yourself a trip."}
{"text":"The service at this place is pretty bad but the food is good.

Came here with two other friends, we ordered the meat loaf, the fried chicken with the side of mac and cheese and the catfish.

The catfish came with a spicy mayo sauce and a sweet pinkish sauce. It tastes pretty delicious with both but I preferred the spicy mayo.

The mac and cheese wasn't anything special, nor was the fried chicken.

The meatloaf was just bad bad bad. It had a strange and unpleasant taste and was really dry, although admittedly I've never been a fan of meatloaf.

I'm definitely going to revisit this restaurant 'cause the catfish was delicious and several people around me and my friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffles smelled fantastic."}
{"text":"Service is as notably poor as you can read in the below reviews - every step of the process took much longer than necessary. To be fair they seem very understaffed. 

In one of our many long wait periods, I ventured downstairs to use the restroom. I was greeted by swarms of flies and bugs coming out of both stalls. I did not go any further in and I legit feel bad for anyone who had to in the past. This might be a actual health violation?

Fast forward a few weeks - our food arrives. I'm admittedly picky when it comes to eggs benedict, but the 'harlem benny' here was a very weak dish, and for the price it's basically a slap in the face not to serve it with a sides/fries. My friend's veggie omelette seemed alright.

The food has potential. Those flies tho.

This is feedback only for the Queen location - the other location I went to on Church was very good."}
{"text":"People always seem to be looking for a good restaurant for parties.

Well, look no further. This is your joint. Reasonably priced food, huge variety, top-notch service, moody atmosphere and delicious meals can all be found here. And bonus! There is none of this faux \"birthday cake plating fee\" to be found here! 

I booked the Harlem Underground a couple weeks in advance for a birthday party. I ended up getting a couple of calls from them leading up to the reservation to clear up some confusion (such as... \"what time again? which sunday? are you still coming?\"), which braced me for a possibly just-as-confusing meal. However, upon arrival, the lovely staff worked their magic to juggle our party of 25+. Everyone's meals came out within the same amount of time, drinks were flowing steadily (as was water), and the servers always had a smile on their face. They spoke passionately about the food and when it came time for it, happily brought the cake out with plates and cutlery, candles blazing. The chef himself even came out to wish the bday boy many happy returns.

Food is great. I tried the hush puppies (fried fish balls) to start - and while it was satisfying, was a little on the bready side. The Bourbon Baby Back ribs were a winner - fleshy, tangy and sweet. If you've never had fried chicken and waffles, try it here. There is just the right amount on the plate and it's a winning combination. The chicken itself was crispy and unbelievably juicy inside - a goal! 

With so many yummy things to choose from - I (and the rest of our party) agree that we'll be coming back here for some more southern lovin'."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place...but remain disappointed.
Went there with a friend and ordered fried okra, probably the best thing there, sangria (don't even bother, tastes like cool aid with shards of fruit). My friend had the Braised Beef Short Ribs and I  the Guinness Marinated Stewed Chicken, the caramelized onions that were suppose to be somewhere in there is what I was craving. To our disappointment the dishes had the same brown sauce on both of our dishes and not a single caramelized onion on my plate...boooo.....and the rice tasted like parboiled rice, on the plus side the chicken was moist.
Now, the reason why I will never come back is the desserts; the fried plantains were not even ripe so it was like biting into a banana chip, and the mango cheesecake...ugh...had a bite could detect something different, had another and still could not make it our, the mango covered the reason, had a taste of the rosette topping and OMG it twas horrible and obviously very very old, I had that awful taste in my mouth for 2 days!!! Now they don't make the cake in house and apparently the cake was purchased just a few days ago, but it must have been purchased bad already, sorry no excuse for that."}
{"text":"Saw many good reviews about this restaurant so we went to give it a try. Food was alright, I expected way better chicken and waffle. Service was decent, the place looks like something many young people like nowadays, a bit hippy. Well of course the food was expensive, definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"i planned a birthday at harlem underground. i was a bit apprehensive, wondering how a party of 14 would play out at this place (mainly because of some of the reviews on yelp) but i was extremely pleased. 

I called a day ahead to make reservation of 14. i requested the patio and they were pretty flexible with last minute changes and accommodating more/less ppl as required. 

the food (especially the fried chicken) was really good, broasted the right amount and huge servings. although many of us enjoying the fried chicken, we weren't too thrilled with any of the side dishes. the mac n cheese, rice with beans and nachos with salsa were mediocre and paled in comparison to the kick ass fried chicken. the waffles were just ok. the food was slightly pricey but huge helpings. 

they have a good patio in the back, and some nights they have live jazz musicians. the music wasn't a major focus for us, we were on the patio and really couldn't hear anything, and i don't even remember a live musician actually. 

our waitress was KILLER! she was awesome, she handled our large group pretty well, we had friends coming and leaving at different times and she kept up with everyone's orders and drinks. she was friendly and humored everyone. 

the downfall was that they don't offer a cash n carry policy for parties of 6 or more. there is only one bill. this was a problem for me since not all of our friends who passed by ate and some of them don't drink. i feel its not fair to charge people alcohol tax etc when they've only ordered an appetizer. i spoke with the manager and he agreed to separate the food bill from the alchohol bill - there was %20 gratuities on both bills. 

we had a fun and pleasant time, the food was good, the appetizers and sides were meh, the watress kicked ass. i'd go back for the fried chicken but don't think i would go back if i was organizing a large group since i don't want to be responsible for a large alcohol bill (i don't drink at all) and i'd prefer a place where ppl can just buy their drinks at the bar. but that's just a personal preference - other than that, this place is great for groups!! 

around $25 per person (entree plus a drink)

must try: any meal with the fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful fall Saturday morning, sunny and warm.  I can't think of a better way to start the day with something fried and something sweet, on a nice patio.  We decided to give Harlem Underground another chance.

We arrived at the restaurant before 11 am and decided to sit on their quiet, casual, low-key back patio.

A friendly and cheerful waitress greeted us, we quickly ordered 2 servings of the fried chicken and waffles... no need to even look at the menu!

About 20 minutes later, we were staring at 2 white square plates, each filled with 3 pieces of crispy fried chicken, waffle+warm Chipolte-corriander-lime maple syrup and fresh salad+dressing.

The Southern fried chicken was  very nicely cooked; crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.  Accompanied by Chipolte-corriander-lime maple syrup, which brought the fried chicken and lovely waffle together.

Unfortunately the coffee was weak with not much flavor.  But, I was enjoying fried chicken too much to let bad coffee ruined my brunch.  So, I quickly overlooked it."}
{"text":"Harlem chef's plate was just enough for the two of us. 
Cornbread, Catfish Lafayette, Candied Plantain, Harlem Crisps, Deep Fried Pickles and Jerk Chicken Quesadilla. $35
Slightly steep but the ambiance was warm, cool crowd, and great music made up for it. 
Not to mention the cocktails. Soooo good and didn't skimp on the booze ;)
Wait staff pleasant and friendly. 
We left early just as the night started to pick up. 
Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Comfort food at it's best!! .

I've tried the guiness stewed chicken, veggie omellete, fried chicken & waffles and the bbq jerk chicken with a side of greens and macroni and cheese and all of the meals so far have been spectacular,

The portions are a great size and we've had to take leftovers home everytime (5 times) we've been there.

Must tries, deep fried pickles and the CORN BREAD!

Friday and Saturday night they have a piano player.  Staff or super chill, great decor, retro menus.

Not a fan of the lime/coriander syrup for the waffles.  Chicken was great, perhaps a little over done but even if the skin did fall off the chicken was seasoned through.

Defintely try it out. Entree will run you about $15 - $17."}
{"text":"Service was very well on a Thursday night but the dishes were underwhelming. Fried chicken was alright. Not as flavorful as KFC unfortunately. Fried pickles were good but nothing extraordinary. Will not be returning for $20 fried chicken."}
{"text":"Open late but not too busy! As a matter of fact at 10 on a Wednesday, we were the only ones there. This seemed to piss off the server.He was probably looking forward to closing early and therefore was not in the friendliest of moods. 

I had the jambalaya with chicken, catfish, shrimp and spicy Italian sausage. First of all, turn up the lights- I can't see what I'm eating! Secondly, it wasn't just the sausage that was hot. The dish was piping hot and mouth-scorchingly spicy. I don't know how I even put so much of it back. I had a decent sized portion of leftovers for the next day. My favourite bites were the ones with just the rice and delicious sauce. Tastes of the mac and cheese as well as the fettuccine were great and made me wish I hadn't ordered such a feisty dish. 

There are a still a lot of things I want to try on the menu!"}
{"text":"For my first time here I would not return by choice! The service was horrible and the food was as good as the service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I especially love their big ass caesar called The Bloody Jerk piled with waffles, fried pickles and a big fat fried chicken drumstick! Whenever we order that drink, we get looks and craning necks from everyone sitting around us. My go to dish is the Southern Fried Chicken with macaroni and bacon side dish. Divine and to die for. I rarely eat fried anything but this is my exception. My boyfriend always orders the braised beef short ribs and the meat just falls off the bone. Without exception, I steal a bite. The lighting could be a little brighter but the art work is on point and the musical selection is stellar (we go for the music as much as we go for the food)."}
{"text":"Walked in because of the interesting restaurant name and most people inside were eating chicken and waffles.

Like the others, I ordered the same thing. My waffles were not fresh, but really soggy and dry - almost tasted like it was pre made and just reheated. The chicken was pretty decent however, not meaty enough, I might have gotten a better deal at KFC.

Service was on the slow side although they were not super busy. The interior is pretty dark, not that great for pictures. The kitchen staff came out pretty often to chit chat, which was frustrating when our server took forever to get us the bill.

I don't see myself coming back here, but other items on their menu may be worth a try."}
{"text":"My motto is, if you serve me food, you deserve a minimum of 2 stars. Well even that didn't happen here at Harlem Underground. If Yelp had the option of zero stars, I'd give them that. 

It wasn't even that busy to begin with and since they had Chicken & Waffles, we thought we'd give that a try. To begin with, it took them about 10 mins to even bring menus. Another 5 minutes to bring water but since service was slow, we decided to put our orders in when they brought the water. Or so we thought we put our orders in. Close to 30 minutes later, we asked what the status was on our order and turns out she didn't even put our order in. In the mean time, our waters weren't even filled up once. To top things off, our server didn't even apologize for the mistake and didn't seem to care that we were walking out.

Worst place I've been to. Definitely not going back here."}
{"text":"Others are so critical stating that \"UMMM this is not real down-home Southern/Soul Food\" - NO SH** SHERLOCK. Let me remind you degenerates and over-the-top wannabe food critiques that we are in Toronto and not in Alabama and we at least should be thankful that we can get something at least as close to the real thing. Just saying.

I absolutely love this place! Food was amazing and the staff (he said he was the manager, the guy that served us) was amazing. My friend's phone was dying so he lend us his charger (wow. thanks). 

We ordered the Bacon Macaroni and Cheese, Fried Chicken dinner and Chicken and Waffles. They were good. I mean, I've tasted better but it was actually really good. No negative opinions about this place at all. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for the \"Hip-Hop Colouring Night,\" which in actuality is basically like any other night with the addition of some colouring paper at each table. My friend (birthday girl) arrived on time for our reservation of 15 people, and because we were all running 15-30 min late, she was told she could only hold the table for 20-30 more minutes. However, when I got there, the place wasn't even busy. Apparently, the male worker with curly dark hair and glasses wasn't being particularly nice about it.

To be honest, I thought it would be a cooler event but it was just a bunch of colouring print-outs of Drake and Queen Latifah. Everyone was left to colour (or not colour), as there wasn't a host engaging with the crowd. Since there was DJ Charlie playing some pretty good throwbacks, I felt some jokes and raffle tickets may have enhanced the experience. There is no point having a themed night if there's nothing different from a typical night.

Food-wise, the fried chicken and waffles ($15.95) is decent but not the best fried chicken in town. With a Red Stripe, the bill came up to $32.50 after tips and taxes. Overall, a decent experience but not the best bang for your buck or tastebuds. The DJ's music was the best part of the evening."}
{"text":"I came here for a summerlicious lunch and first things first if you are googling the address MAKE SURE you type in \"Harlem Underground\" and not just Harlem, or else the 67 Richmond East address will come up (which has closed) I learned this the hard way by showing up to a non-exist restaurant. It is misleading because on the Sumemrlicious website the restaurant is just listed as \"Harlem\". 

Appetizer- corn bread (1/5) 
- When I saw corn bread on the menu I was very excited as I have not come across good corn bread in Toronto. I ended up being quite disappointed. The portion was microscopic, the appetizer came with two pieces of corn bread which were two inches long and maybe 1 inch wide. The corn bread it self was very dense, overcooked and extremely dry. The only thing that saved it was by loading it up with butter. 

Main- Catfish Sammy (3/5)
 
I had the catfish sammy which is a pan-seared Cajun Catfish with scotch-bonnet mayo, which I had on coco bread with a side of sweet potato fries. The catfish was quite tender and delicious, but was definitely not Cajun, there was absolutely no spice/heat to the fish. The coco bread was interesting, a light fluffy coconut flavoured bread. The side of sweet potato fries was sub-par, as several of the sweet potato fries were burnt/black. 

Dessert- Candied Plantain (2/5)
- The only reason I am giving this a 2 is because the plantains came with ice cream and whip cream. The plantains themselves were clearly not ripe enough. They were extremely startchy and dry with no sweetness to them. I regularly cook with plantains and know that these were not ripe enough to be turned into a dessert. 

Service 4/5
- The wait staff was very friendly, knowledgable about the menu and honest by offering tips on which dishes are better on the menu and which dishes are not so great 
- Note, even for small groups (I came here with just myself and a friend) tips are automatically included at 18%. 

Atmosphere 
- The atmosphere offers a cool, relaxed, Caribbean bar feel to it. There is lots of interesting art work and the front of the restaurant opens up, giving it a patio feel. 

Would I return?
Based on the summerlicious lunch I had, no. When I decided to try Harlem I was expecting to have a very flavourful, spicey and savoury, homestyle cooked meal. Instead I had an underwhelming bland meal. However, based on the service I would return, as the staff were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We went with some friends on the weekend. Decent place no line up but quite loud. 
We ordered waffles with fried chicken and southern fried chicken. They only serve dark meat which was disappointing and also bone in which is hard to eat with waffles. Food was on the greasy side. I have definitely had better friend chicken. Would not go back."}
{"text":"The Harlem Chef's Plate, with fried chicken, is a perfect sharing plate. I also recommend the jerk quesadilla, the meatloaf - hell, it's all good. Their sangria is delicious, too."}
{"text":"Staff~Great, friendly, humorous & attentive!
Food~Mac & cheese was ok, more on the butter side needs to be a more sharper cheese so you can taste the cheese! Finally waffles & fried chicken, wasn't what I expected..the fried chicken was good..the waffles kind of dry, tasted like it came out of a frozen pack & heated in the microwave...Dropping Mad Beets was ok (I love goat cheese, so made it good)...red velvet cake, didn't eat much of it, ate more of the ice cream!
Atmosphere~Low toned music sounded as if it was playing on a bedroom CD player, although good back-in-the day tunes! Location~Mid Toronto in Fashion district, accessible by public transit, parking on a Saturday afternoon cost me $4 for 2 hrs on the street!
Winterlicious allowed us to come here, overall don't think I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food!

We were just walking by when we came by this place. Caribbean inspired food, for a Toronto based clientele. 

We were super impressed with the Seafood Fondue, the Portobello Swiss Wrap, an the Collard greens.

The staff was very accommodating about allowing us to order off the dinner menu although it was still only around lunch.

There is a cute patio in the rear, great for the summertime, and spring days.  

Since we live in the neighbourhood, we will definitely come dine here again."}
{"text":"Ciara is such a good server! Attentive and really knows the menu. And the food/drinks where great!"}
{"text":"Maybe its because it was busy when I came, but I'm not loving this place as much as I did the first time. 

Pros: 
-I love the atmosphere, the red walls and patterned ceiling, the outdoor bit is beautiful, the piano, the menu-on-a-record idea, the big velvet curtains, a whole buncha stuff. 
-the way they mix flavours- yum! I got the quesadillas and the spicy coconut honey drizzle?! Delicious. 
-the salad dressing was super yum, it was a  sweet balsamic-y kinda dressing, but more oily that was super smooth and sweet without that acidic aftertaste I get from other balsamic dressings. 
-food came out quickly, even though it was fairly busy. 
-pineapple coconut juice- yum! 

50/50
-I usually dine alone; I usually out traveling somewhere or I feel like people watching. The guy at the counter looked at me with annoyance when I said I wanted a table for one-slash-myself, which set my mood there as unwelcomed. Though, I had a really nice server who was obviously swamped and working hard, being patient really listening to everyone she spoke with, which was way better than she needed to be. I really appreciated her skill and excellent attitude unlike buddy behind the bar. 
-if a tables reserved, then don't tell people wandering in that they can sit there if they want. Yikes. It was the same guy who made me feel uncomfortable, but hopefully he was just having a bad day and isn't that level of bad server usually. 

Cons
-the lack of quality of the meat was evident. 
-the breading of the chicken Lafayette tasted like it was once crispy and warm, but dried soggy and got reheated. Gross. 
-sometimes I got clusters of soggy breading. Still gross, but disappointing too. 
-my chicken morsels smelled like fish (and yes, it was supposed to be chicken) and tasted odd. They didn't sit well in my stomach (and sat the same way it does when my slight seafood allergy is triggered.) 
-the salad with the quesadillas were soaked with the balsamic. Suggestion = dressing on the side as not to super soak gentle greens. 
-the breading! That was absolutely horrible. Like just flour and meat kind of plain. The chicken was overcooked and stringy, the breading plain and the texture soggy. I have absolutely no clue how they're up for one of the best fried chicken joints in the city. Yikes. I had to force myself to finish it. 

Its alright, you won't die or anything, but ill be ok if I never set foot in there ever again. I wouldn't recommend it either, especially to those self conscious of having to do something as necessary as eating, even if it is alone."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and easy going. This venue is very welcoming and I have been satisfied with the two veggie dishes I ate at this restaurant.  I will return here in the future because I like supporting local businesses that care about their customers and demonstrate their appreciation."}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday. 

Nice cozy spot, friendly staff, cool music even a live performer at 8. 

Good menu with a  decent selection of Afro-American / soul food. 

I had the chicken and waffles. The Chicken was excellent , crispy batter, juicy meat perfectly done. Portion size was a little small compared to others but definitely in the top as far as taste. 

Others at the table had the smoked jerk bbq chicken and the braised beef short rib. Both also have excellent. As apps we tried the 

Drink menu was good, i went with the Red Stripe Jamaican beer. Ahhhhh"}
{"text":"Loved this location! 

We had a wonderful chat with the owner while we were here.

I got the chicken and waffles and it was delicious. 

The venue is small but its cozy. It had a nice ambiance to it and everyone who was there was really friendly - including the people sitting on both sides of us. 

They had a DJ in the back spinning some cool tunes.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Last night me, my fiance and a group of four friends decided to try Harlem Underground while the Summerlicious food promotion was underway. We ordered one appetizer, main and dessert each off the prix fix menu. 

The service started out good, got appetizers, drinks and mains quickly but when it came to dessert it seems like they forgot all about us. We made two complaints about the slow service and seemed that only one of the servers took notice and got us our deserts after waiting 45 minutes for them. 

We ordered the Blackened Catfish, Chicken and Waffles, and the Braised Short Ribs.

The food was good but not amazing, not worth coming back for.

Later that night my fiance and another friend got TERRIBLE food poisoning. I'm not talking about a small stomach ache. I'm talking about severe vomiting, chills, and even a fever that lasted for 8 hours. The food poisoning was so severe that I considered taking him to the emergency clinic at 4:30 am. 

I think the owners of this restaurant need to clean up their act as they are serving food that is unsafe for consumption. There could be serious food inspection agency violations here, consumers eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"I had to leave this post because my coworkers and I just had Ubereats deliver three servings of fried chicken and waffles to our work - delicious! How often does your delivery food taste nothing like the food you're served at the restaurant? I loved it. We all did. The chicken was fried perfectly and the waffles were so fluffy. Thank you Harlem for a hearty lunch."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting, and we were not disappointed.  Service was a tiny bit slow, but the restaurant was VERY busy and there only seemed to be two servers and two bussers. All the waitstaff were very pleasant! The rum punch was delicious, though not particularly strong.  We ordered chicken & waffles, cornbread, fried okra, and Catfish Lafayette and everything was perfectly cooked and delicious! We will definitely be back the next time we're in the city!"}
{"text":"Chicken'n waffles have been a long running joke amongst my friends and i was thrilled to find somewhere downtown to try this 'delicacy'...

The portions were huge and the staff was friendly. We ordered frogs legs to start which I could've done without since they themselves kind of tasted like fried chicken.

The chicken was okay: spicy batter, super greasy, but sadly a little over cooked / bordering burnt... served with both gravy and syrup, I always enjoy things that mix salty and sweet. A salad or some sort of fresh garnish would've been appreciated.

I'll give them another shot, but only because I can't think of another place in T.O to fill this soul food craving."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious 2013. In a word, this place was horrible but let me give you a few details

Service is terrible. My meal started with my waiter bringing me a warm beer. The time it took for the food to arrive was also incredibly long.

For starter, I got the catfish. It tasted like it was frozen before and they just popped it into the deep fryer before serving it to me. 

For the main course, I got the Chicken and Waffles, which for some unknown reason is ranked #2 on BlogTo. This was the worst fried chicken I've had in my life. Popeye's and KFC are both MUCH tastier than this. Chicken was dry and had no flavor or seasoning at all. And for the Waffles they used AUNT JEMIMA maple syrup (I saw them pour it) which baffled me. How can they be charging so much and serving food like this?
I cannot believe BlogTO ranked this Chicken and Waffles above the Drake Hotel's chicken and waffles even though that dish is ten billion times better. 

For dessert, I got the Almond chocolate kisses, which were all in a big Pizza box. The waiter simply took one out of the pizza box, put it on a plate and served it to me. I was so dissapointed with this meal.

This place basically serves expensive Cafeteria food. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Catfish Lafayette. Need I say more? \"Seasoned deep fried morsels with a duo of sauces: Sweet-n-hot sauce and Jerk-scallion Mayo.\"
Sooo goood!! I don't normally eat fish but this just hit the spot! A buddy ordered it and I wanted to try it. Delicious! It melts in your mouth kind of good."}
{"text":"chill vibe, soul food, drinks to boot. 

the SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN is what you have pictured in your head when you finally cave in to your inner fat kid and get KFC, yet it's so far from the greasy, salty bucket o' mess. disappointing though that the chicken was served with sweet chili thai sauce and gravy, both in plastic dip cups. the slightest additional effort to have proper dishware would've made a big difference, even with generic tasting sauce.

CAJUN SMOKED SIDE RIBS are a secret entrée hidden in the appetizers for any carnivore with a small appetite (oxymoron?). fall-off-the-bone, tender, laced in dat sawce. satisfying, served with collard greens (yum) and rice. 

MAC N CHEESE, though served in a piping hot dish, wasn't much to write home about and less so was the CORNBREAD. 

service was on par for a relatively slow weeknight; pleasant."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre. Fried chicken was overly greasy with a lack a flavour. Honestly, I hate to say it but KFC is tastier. I spent 23 dollars and left hungry. Maybe try their other food, maybe it tastes better."}
{"text":"an afro-affair

Harlem Underground describes its food as Afro-American/Afro-Carribean with a modern twist.  That's a whole lot of a little somethings.

I had their lunch years ago.  From what I remembered it was flavourful.  I heard their chicken and waffles were delicious so I decided it was time I return.

I met up with Kitty and Aerie for a brunch date on a warm, but cloudy Saturday.  I have to say we three stuck out amongst the tattooed jeans-and-T hipsters, inasmuch as Kitty is more Chanel, Aerie is more X3 and me?  Well my jeans are Joe's and my T is Splendid.  Just sayin.  Hipster or not, the joint is casual and comfortable.  That is if you're not seated next to the LOUDEST four-some ever.  The table next to us was four hipsters yelling at the top of their lungs and laughing like mad cows on ebola milk; that much ruckus isn't meant for public on a Saturday afternoon.

So although our Saturday didn't start the way I would have hoped, the four-some left just as our food arrived.  

Kitty had the Crab Avocado Benny sans hollandaise.  We all agreed there was a serious lack of crab.  If you can't smell it, see it or taste it, is it really there?  Hipster waitress A insisted there was crab without even looking at the dish.  Her dismissiveness was balanced out by Hipster waitress B who agreed with us.  Only she came back from the kitchen saying the chef insisted there was crab but could \"give us more\" if we wanted.  Kitty declined.  

Aerie had the Harlem Benny - poached eggs served with chili-garlic greens, atop a sausage and grits, and a flap jack with cheesy hollandaise.  Good, although I didn't taste the sausage.

I of course had the chick-n-waff.  It came with scotch bonet-corriander lime syrup and gravy sauce.  The sauces were yum, but the chick-n-waffs didn't compare to Stockyards.  Not even close.  The chicken was small and the flavour was pretty bland.  The waffles were cute - fluffy round things - but nothing spectacular.

So, in sum - skip the brunch."}
{"text":"Really nice vibe, however food is crap n wait is ridiculous, I swear I stayed in there only cuz of music but I will never ever again pay $40 for burned salmon n really sweet guacamole:("}
{"text":"Harlem = Amazing Brunch. I walk by Harlem everyday on my way into work and never thought too much of it... That is until I walked by on a Sunday morning and saw someone enjoying brunch and thought to myself... \"Hmmm... That looks delightful\". I then proceeded to rally the brunch troops and head to Harlem for some grub. I couldn't be more impressed with their menu. It's simple and simply delicious. I have the Harlem Mash up. The portions aren't too overwhelming as sometimes I find restaurants like to bombard their plates with too many hash browns. 

The menus are on old records which give new life to an otherwise dust collector. (I say that though I have a record player and love them oh so much.. But let's be honest). 

The coffee keeps flowing and the music is awesome. . You won't regret going to Harlem."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on a Friday night with some friends. The reservation was made about 4 weeks in advance, a confirmation was given the day before and they still managed to get the wrong time. May I ask what the point of making a reservation is if we still had to wait 30 minutes for our table? They apologized sincerely but I was still disappointed. Second off, it took about 45 minutes for our food to come to the table. At the 30 minute mark, I asked our waiter to follow up on our food and he replied with, \"there is a party in the back today.\" I emphasized that its been about 30 minutes since we ordered. He replied again with an attitude I did NOT appreciate, \"there is a party in the back.\" Whether there is a party in the back or not, this does not justify why my food comes 45 minutes later. The restaurant does not have adequate staff to accommodate for the number of people on a friday night. I was extremely disappointed. Needless to say, I will not be attending Harlem Underground ever again."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious with my boyfriend. The environment is very nice, and I liked the music that they had playing. Staff were nice and served us immediately. The food was good - but some things had too much sauce. 

We started with the Jerk Chicken Quesadilla & Buffalo chicken bites. The quesadilla was SO good! Unfortunately, they drizzle it with a sweet Chili sauce, which made the quesadilla almost soggy and hard to handle properly. The taste was overall good, so I can't really complain. The chicken bites were basically swimming in BBQ sauce, which made the chicken bites not crispy. It overpowered the dish. 

For our mains, my boyfriend got the Jerk Smoked BBQ Chicken, and I ordered the Chicken & Waffles. He said his dish was really good, but there was a bit too much sauce on the chicken - but that could just be his preference.  My chicken and waffles were delicious! Definitely recommend coming here for that!

For dessert, We ordered the brownie & the candied plantain. We didn't get a chance to eat it because we were so full, so we took it home with us. The brownie was good (in restaurant comes with ice cream). The candied plantain came with A LOT of caramel sauce so be warned if you're not a huge fan. This restaurant seems to love their sauces!"}
{"text":"Always delicious food and drinks. I used to go to other other location, but that one closed sadly. The staff at both locations though are super friendly.

Drinks-wise I usually get the Harlem Koolaid, but the Dark and Stormy is also very delicious.

Food is all comfort and delicious. Cornbread, mac and cheese, candied plantains, jerk chick, chicken and waffles, and more. All so so sooo good.

Highly recommend going on a night where there is live music going on for a great night out with friends and good food."}
{"text":"Food was not good and drinks were not good. The run punch did not taste like run punch. The cornbread was horrible due to lack of flavor and it was Cold and dry."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot! We stopped by here for dinner one night and I really liked the restaurant. They were pretty booked, but they had some seating in the back (which is pretty much outdoors, with roof). The experience was cool.

The food was good, the staff was very friendly, and we had a good time here. Prices were reasonable too for the food, and overall I had a good experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"The braised beef is amazing!  It's so incredibly soft and tender. The fried chicken was good as well but pales in comparison to the beef. The portions are quite generous. The corn bread was the only disappointment. For $5, it was a tiny plate and just didn't seem to stand out when compared to the other delicious offerings."}
{"text":"Back again on the weekend to show my brother's heart some abuse.

The good: He was bowled over by the chicken and waffles, I finally tried and love the fish - anything and everything battered here is simply wicked - and The Harlem: Grilled, three layers of black forest ham, jerked chicken salad, avocado, mango mustard & cheese on challah bread. It doesn't read like it works, but it works!

The bad: Hot Crab & Crawfish Dip with chili-garlic toast. Not real crab (probably pollock) and not crawfish (if it looks like shrimp and tastes like shrimp, it's probably shrimp)

My only beef about this place - I can't stop myself from going back."}
{"text":"Service was slow , the ceaser was spicer than the jerk chicken ... no hot sauce ... no too much to draw me back to this \"joint\""}
{"text":"Friendly service, but very disorganized and slow.  The restaurant was packed for Winterlicious which led me to believe that I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately, the food was merely ok and came out very, very slowly.  They auto-gratuitied a table of 2 for 15%, it was definitely not deserved but lesson learned, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I liked it there!  It is a cute, little place with tons of personality.  Our server was quite nice and very quick with drinks.  The food did take forever to come out (as some people here have mentioned) but I didn't really mind all that much.

I went for the Jerk Chicken Quesadillas and I was not disappointed.  They were PIPING hot when they came out.  My only complaint is that they were dripping grease down my hand; however, this is a creole/southern joint and I feel that is to be expected.

These people know how to spice things up and I'd definitely like to return and sample the other menu items.  The only other issue I had that wasn't food related was that jazz band.  GAWD, they were loud and took random breaks without warning that led to an abundance of extreme loud talking!  But aside from that, a good time!"}
{"text":"...WOW, this place has the BEST fried chicken i have ever had in my life!  nice atmosphere - great art on the walls and the waitresses are very friendly.  my boyfriend and i were very excited to find out there is a place that serves fried chicken and waffles southern style, so we both ordered it for our first visit.  we also ordered cornbread and deep fried pickles as apps.

it took quite some time for everything for us to get our food, and the first thing we were served was our main dishes - not our apps?  either way, we were hungry so we dug in.  the batter on the fried chicken was uniquely crispy while the meat was tender and juicy on the inside - LOVE IT.  the waffles were fluffy and thick, although it could have been a little more browned.  it was served with 3 types of dipping sauce: maple syrup, spicy sweet and sour sauce, and gravy.

almost halfway through our meal we had to remind the waitress about our apps, which we soon figured out were not even ordered yet.  it finally came about 10 minutes later and as an apology for the wait, our wonderful waitress who was clearly short-staffed and running the entire storefront herself, offered the cornbread on the house!  cornbread was great; i could have passed on the deep fried pickles.

overall, don't expect quick service at this place, however their food and friendly smiles are quite worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I love southern/creole food.

We were here for a party with 12-14 people. Everyone arrived at 8:30, with the birthday boy coming in at 9.

Only drinks were offered until he had arrived and said all his hellos (which took time.) It would have been a great opportunity for them to up-sell some apps while we were waiting, but no one offered (or was available) to take a food order until nearly 9:30 PM. Everyone noticed this.

Drinks are very expensive - cocktails especially.

I paid nearly $20 for my jambalya which was quite tasty - I like a lot of spice - and the sausage and meats were cooked really nicely. It was piping hot (I always notice this.) But to be fair - this is essentially a casserole dish - and $20 felt pretty steep. The portions were massive and most people at our long table didn't come close to finishing their food. Reduce the price, reduce the portion, reduce the pure waste. Half my bowl was empty - and I am a GOOD eater.

There was a man playing an out-of-tune upright piano and playing covers. He was working hard to be accommodating (asking people what they'd like to hear before he started playing) but he was too loud, and to be frank, not very good - so we were all yelling at each other across the table.

We had to leave slightly earlier than others, and so asked the server to split out our two entrees and four drinks. This took 10-15 minutes and she was clearly upset about being asked to do this. Both my partner and I have been servers in fine dining restaurants. This. Is. Not. Hard. Or time consuming. I have absolutely no patience for servers who act like the sky is falling every time you ask them to split a cheque. Especially when all the meals have been auto-grat'd 20%!!

This reaction in combination with the lacklustre service to that point was sort of the last straw and we likely won't return - and keep going to Southern Accent instead. Most of the people we were with were not impressed by the service.

I understand it can be challenging to wait on large parties, but an experienced staff will recognize this ahead of time when the reservation is made, and have sufficient support in place."}
{"text":"I initially learned of Harlem Underground through their Instagram feed. There's just something about an appealing picture of food. After scrolling through, I knew I had to add them to my must visit list.  

The spot is cute, quaint and not too far from downtown. I loved the neighborhood. The night I visited, there were a few patrons listening to a vocalist and guitarist. Y'all, that sis could sang. Anywho, back to the reason for my visit. The food. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles with a side of rum punch. Everything was divine. The chicken was moist, favorably seasoned and had a good crispy skin. The waffle held it's on against the chicken and was a great accompaniment.  The rum punch did not disappoint.  If my first meal in the city went this well I'm in for a treat.

I read a few prior reviews about issues with the staff attentiveness but I did not experience that at all. My server was helpful and point. 

The wall decor was too cute. It reminded me of the Ernie Barnes' dance party painting on the show, Goodtimes. It set the scene of a good party that was about to take place."}
{"text":"I heard this place had great chicken and waffles so decided to try it.  The serving size was big and the chicken tasted pretty good.  The waffles were a bit on the soggy side.  The food was ok, but a little overpriced for what it was.

The service was terrible.  There were only two guys working and they seemed to be in charge of the bar as well.  Someone who seemed to be the manager asked me to move tables twice while I waited for my friends, despite there being barely anyone there when I arrived.  Two servers could have provided decent service given it wasn't that busy but they ended up chatting with each other.  I don't think I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect from my dining groups latest selection.  I love southern soul food, and the menu looked amazing, but it sounded like so many people had had only okay experiences.  

Luckily, that wasn't the case for me.

I wasn't starving when I arrived, so I decided that I'd order from the appetizers list.  I chose the Cajun smoked side ribs, since they came with rice and collard greens - the more things I get to try, the happier I am!  The other choices at the table were the fried chicken, the jerk meatloaf, quesadillas, spring rolls, and mac n cheese.  I also ordered a side of fried okra.  I've never tried okra before, so I figured I should take advantage of the opportunity when it was only $5.  

My order was definitely not an appetizer.  I got about 6 meaty ribs, a ton of rice, and lots of greens.  For $10.95, I was already happy.  I was even happier when I started eating.  The ribs were delicious.  The sauce wasn't sweet (luckily, since I hate that), but it wasn't really spicy either.  The word that came to mind was tangy.  The rice and collard greens weren't anything special but they made a good accompaniment.  And I loved the okra!  Apparently it can be slimy if not prepared properly, but there wasn't a bit of \"slime\" to this dish.  They were breaded and deep fried and served with a creamy sauce with a bit of a kick.  It actually reminded me of asparagus, which I love.

Everyone else seemed very happy with their meals as well.  Everything was very generous (4 pieces of fried chicken, 3 big slices of meatloaf, etc), especially since the price point was very reasonable.  

The service was good, he checked on us without hovering, and had no problems with splitting the bill or packing up the leftovers that almost everyone had.  

All in all, really good food, very generous for the price point, good service - I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for \"soul food\", which encompasses anything that's incredibly unhealthy for me soaked in butter, deep fried and served with melted cheese.

The Good: 
- Fish and chips tasted incredible.  Red striped battered, hot and crispy, cooked to perfection.  Probably the best fish and chips I've had in the city so far. 

- Fat Carl was AMAZING! Very succulent, juicy, crispy chicken (even better than the stand alone fried chicken), soft bread and a mmmmm factor of 11.

The Okay: 
- Pulled pork waffle - exactly as it's described.  Not bad but completely pales in comparison to the items above.

- Southern fried chicken and waffles were lacking.  The skin was deliciously crispy but the chicken itself was dry on the inside.  

- Catfish & Collard Green Soup got mixed reviews at our table, some said it was perfect, others like me thought it could've used more flavour.  Still not bad at all.

- Collard Greens tasted good but nothing too memorable

The Bad:

- Mac and cheese had absolutely nothing going for it. Bland, not cheesy enough and let's be honest - if you're not tasting better than instant KD, you're doing something wrong.

I can't remember what else we got, but by the end of it my heart wasn't too pleased with me.  Would recommend this place to anyone.  Be prepared to eat and breathe heavy afterwards."}
{"text":"Dropped by recently to sample this place for Sunday brunch.  Ordered the chicken & waffles and fried okra. 
Pro's
-server was very cheery and attentive
-portions are a decent size for the price
-they made a mistake with our order and gave us a free appetizer to compensate for the mistake(nice gesture)
-chicken was nicely fried and lightly seasoned

Con's
-Cajun Fried okra batter was very bland, no seasonings I ended up not finishing the order it was just too bland
-waffles were just ok--nothing special would have preferred better syrup to accompany them

I will probably try their Richmond location next before returning to this one."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for Summerlicious on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't busy at all. They had a very limited menu because of Summerlicious, but were flexible so you could order single Summerlicious items without doing he full 3 course meal.

I ordered the Bloody Jerk - the one towering with chicken and waffles. It's a great Bloody Mary, on the spicy side, but I wish there were some pickles. For $20 this cocktail is a meal itself. I didn't end up ordering from the Summerlicious menu.

My friends tried the catfish sandwich, Bert salad and chicken and waffles, and jerk chicken quesadilla, which were all pretty good. 

I'd love to try some of their other items another time."}
{"text":"Came here for winterliscious today, lunch
Overall had a good lunch
Chicken and waffles
App was the jamaican cornmeal bread, it wss delicious 
And dessert the plantains and icecream
Service was quick, food came fast
Music and venue were cool"}
{"text":"3-3.5 stars

I came here for Winterlicious this past Thursday and this place was packed! With only one server for the night. I remember I came in and there was no one to greet us so we just stood there awkwardly waiting for someone to come to us. The server saw us and I told him I had made a reservation for winterlicious. And he just looked at me like I was foreign or something. Anyways, we were seated to our table which btw the tables are quite close to each other so you may or may not eavesdrop ;).

For our dinner, I ordered the fried catfish as an appetizer to start followed by the jerk BBQ chicken and the the fried plantain to finish. The fried catfish was good and I believe it's the same flouring for the fried okra as well. The jerk BBQ chicken was really good but a tad spicy for me and the fried plantain wasn't exactly fried and goes well with the vanilla ice cream. That dessert seemed to be the most popular choice. 

All in all, service was a bit weird and non existent because at first I didn't know who exactly was the server. And when I wanted to order I waved someone over who turned out to be a busser. Not sure if I'll go out of my way to visit Harlem again though."}
{"text":"I normally go to the east side Harlem as its closer to me but I thought Id try the other harlem instead.  I preferred the food here, same menu but better presentation and the patio area pretty nice.

Cornbread, southern fried chicken, sweet potato fries, rice and pea...basic food but cooked very well, always the sign of a good place in my opinion!"}
{"text":"We had the bloody jerk and the chicken and waffle. It's a nice place to cine chill with friends and east good food and drink. The stalker and the decor is very nice and low key. They have a patio on the back. It was good to see that the restaurant featured local artists art on the walls."}
{"text":"Served room temperature water in 85 degree weather. Some of the servers or helpers had no friendly customer service manners nor did they give us any suggested items to drink, eat, etc..... Sangria was pretty refreshing (white) though."}
{"text":"Excellent service, feels like you've gone to a friend's kitchen. The short ribs were so tender they fell off their bones!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant one evening for dinner with my gf and her coworker.  For me, the experience was pretty good.  The staff was pleasant and accommodating (we had a reservation and made a request to change our table at the last minute) and served us immediately.  I love that the food comes to your table piping hot.  Two of us ordered the fried chicken (which comes with two sauces, one of which reminds me of a sweet and sour sauce that I love) and the mac and cheese.  Both were equally tasty.  Though the chicken was already flavorful on its own, the addition of the sauce added an extra depth to the flavor.  If I had to mention anything though, it would be that substituting items isn't as easy.  I don't know if it was an honest misunderstanding or just something that wasn't possible, but my gf initially wanted to order a different meal, but had to go with the fish instead, which was okay."}
{"text":"It was so silly of us to make a reservation on a Sunday Morning in the summer  (thinking this place would be packed .... ) maybe it was too early?? 11am? We thought there would be a huge lineup.. but we were wrong.  we pretty much got the whole restaurant to ourselves 

they have a pretty large space, perfect for holding a good amount of tables indoor and I can see they have a nice patio section too!! (apparently they also have music / lives shows on certain evenings -- I should try coming here again for that!! ) 

Talking about their brunch menu --- MMmmm my first Chicken and waffle experience... Since i've never tried the idea of chicken and waffle before, I thought it was good --- but like some people's comments about the plastic dipping sauce --- I didn't enjoy it that much ahahha.. It moved around a lot every time I wanted to dunk my chicken in and ... the waffle itself wasn't that amazing!

There were a lot of other things on the menu that I would wanna try so maybe I'll venture out to the southwest end of Toronto again to get my foodie cravings fulfilled!"}
{"text":"Walking past those 2 tied-up Curtains that is their passage to the dining space, I wanted to give those things a big TUG and see what prizes I won. Sitting near the Kitchen meant that the Cook nodded me Goodbye as I looked through the pass. The back is a Garage Bar space that is suitable for a Garage Band I guess to perform for private events. 

I heard from the Yelpers in attendance that the Bathroom was nice. I guess that might be the Underground part of Harlem Underground. Staff make it a point that you get both the Brunch & Lunch Menu during this Sunday Noon hour. 

Harlem Benny($10.95) had some good segments done well especially the perfectly Poached Egg oozing Yolkiness. Classic Hollandaise with some Cheese. The Garlic Collards didn't bring much to the show and made the Sausage Pancake below soggy. Not my first pick for Brunch item as nothing really popped out of all its parts. 2.5 *Star* 

Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle($11.95) where the Chipotle-Corriander-Lime Maple Syrup was the highlight and I pretty much only tasted Maple Syrup although I physically see Chili Seeds as well. Waffles, Salad, Fruits are regular Brunch items nothing unique in that sense so I was really looking for the Fried Chicken to make this dish. 

It does provide a Crunchy Battered Skin a la Extra Crispy Double Battered at KFC, just slightly less so. What it lacked was the umami savoury Marinade although I did taste a hint but not enough. Another point is that the Flour is where the seasoning can be compounded. I just felt that it wasn't seasoned well enough and it could have been JUICIER especially when it's fried to order. 

I guess I'm used to extremely well Seasoned/Marinaded Fried Chicken from my personal background. This meal there was nothing aweful and everything was A-OK but I guess much like Lauren, I had a bit more expectation since indie Fried Chicken is rare in Toronto.  Also when I last smelled something delicious at Harlem East."}
{"text":"- Waited 10 mins before greeting. 

- Sat down, no cutlery or cups for the water, until we asked for it...

- The table beside us was served before us even though they sat 15 mins later than us. 

- My sides came way before the main and my extra side didn't come  until I was done eating.

- Portions are small & over priced

- Waitress threw the receipt back at us when she saw no tip.

*music was good so y'all get 1 star."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.  I'm sorry.  I went here for dinner, so I might need to go back here for brunch.  Here are my notes:

1. Menu online is not the the same as in person.  There was crawfish on the online menu...none in person....grrrrrrrr!
2. Bacon Mac N Cheese -- too salty
3. Braised beef ribs -- very good, but temperature was a little on the cold side
4. Jambalaya -- just ok, the sausage was hella dry
5. Service was excellent

Overall, I'd probably give it 2.5 stars and I'd go back to see if they made improvements.  My girlfriend, who grew up in Louisiana, also felt the same about this place as well.  Love the idea of a soul food joint though."}
{"text":"Went with two friends as a part of a restaurant hopping food tour night.

So we stepped in to try the Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle and the Harlem Jambalaya with a side of sweet potato fries.

The southern fried chicken was done well.  Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  If you are feeling brave, try it with their homemade scotch-bonet-coriander-lime syrup.  It is extremely fiery and I only tried the smallest drop on my food.

The jambalaya had lots of flavour and you could identify the different proteins like the catfish, shrimp, and italian sausage.  It was almost a little too soft and mushy for my preferences because it also felt like the consistency of microwave instant oatmeal but that didn't take away from the bursts of flavour in the dish.  It's a small thing, so tiny but I thought it should be mentioned.

Service was great and although it was quiet on the Wednesday night, there is a backroom to the restaurant that turns into a dancefloor/live music during the weekend."}
{"text":"On par with some of the best soul food I've had in Atlanta and better than anything I've had in the real Harlem, lol.  I got the chicken and waffles, which were excellent.  The waffles were extremely fluffy and the chicken was crunchy and tender - not seasoned as good as Popeyes but the crunch and sauce makes up for it.  It's good in a different way.  The greens were delicious but I wasn't into the mac and cheese that much.  Everything definitely tasted like home cooking.  Overall, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, great food....Chicken and waffles!!! But this place gives ya nice salad on the side. In the evening they have a DJ to add to the ambience. I have been here twice now on a Sunday noonish and surprisingly I was able to get a seat right away."}
{"text":"I went here during the Winterlicious and tried the Chicken and Waffles and became an instant fan! The service was good, we were a group of 6-7. The restaurant is nice and cozy. The portion sizes and flavour were perfection. I really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"I came here for a special event, a dark and stormy hip hop colouring night. 

The ambience is nice, it's a very cozy space so perfect for tables of 4 or less. The DJ played some amazing tunes and it was a very nostalgic feel for the evening. The colouring supplies provided were mediocre and i would highly recommend bringing your own art supplies. 

I was very disappointed with the food. For the prices they charge, i was expecting a higher quality meal. The jerk chicken still had the skin on it and was drowned in a store bought sauce. The mac and cheese was definitely made with a cheese-based powder and just topped with grated cheese. Dessert was delicious probably because it was purchased from Costco. 

The service was also terrible. Given that it's not a large venue, very surprised how little I saw of the wait staff and our bills had to be redone multiple times. 

The colouring idea is unique and it's refreshing. However, it's unlikely I would go back until they improve the food and service."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink after dinner. I was drawn in by the casual exterior and from what I could see from outside, a full but not crazily busy interior.

I love their menu printed on records (I think real records?!?). We just ordered drinks, service was friendly. lounged around for a bit and felt like I could of stayed there all night slowly sipping on some drinks. Music was cool and not too loud. Overall a good place to kick back and unwind on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Went to a friends celebration to this restaurant last night. We decided to check this place out for a coloring event.

a) The place was severely understaffed. They had two waiters (who were also bartenders) that looked after 50 tables. Took an hour to get the bill.

b) The coloring event was basically them giving you a box of crayons and some pages to color in. Honestly, you could have done so much more with this concept.

c) The food was ok. I am pretty sure their Mac & Cheese is just the Kraft dinner. The fettuccine was ok. The chicken and waffles didn't use the best chicken. The crips were terrible.

d) The website advertised different prices than what was at the restaurant. Luckily the waiter honored the website prices.

e) They had a live DJ but we were all pretty sure it was just an itunes playlist

So we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Me and my girl friends went there for brunch on a Sunday, we ordered chicken and waffles. The server was friendly and came to check on us several times. The food was good, the fried chicken was cooked to my liking, with crispy skin, and waffles tasted good too :) they were served with gravy, maple syrup, and forgot the last one... Had a good experience there"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing great things about their Chicken and Waffles. It was quite good. It comes with a large waffle and two pieces of chicken, along with two sauces and some greens. The breading on the chicken is thick to the point that there isn't that much meat, but the seasoning was good enough to compensate. The waffles, on the other hand, were great. 

The interior is simple and dark, and the the menus were record-shaped. Service was decent enough. Those chicken and waffles though, I'd definitely come back to have those again."}
{"text":"I still remember the first bite of the fried chicken I had here. The exterior was very crispy and well-seasoned while the interior was juicy. Waffles were good too but nothing special about them. Food was good overall, but I was not a fan of plastic containers for syrup and chili sauce. The presentation of the plate could have been much better if they served them in different containers.

My one complaint for this place was that the music was really loud. We were directed to the bar area upstairs because it was full in the dining area. If you are just eating there, I do not recommend going upstairs."}
{"text":"Very happy with Harlem Underground. Didn't hear much about this place on either blogs or from friends but heard they had fried chicken and waffles so had to try. We also had the jerk chicken quasadias. The fried chicken was amazing and had its own crispy taste. My favorite though was the waffles and syrup. 

The only negative I would say was the price. It was a little expensive seeing the portions were a little smaller than I would have liked."}
{"text":"Love the environment. Wasn't crowded (because of the weather), but still lively. The fried chicken was decent...wasn't the most flavorful, but thick and filling. Waffles were great.  Bartender / server was very attentive and friendly.  If I return to Toronto, I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations.  Ordered the southern fried chicken with mac 'n cheese.  The coating for the chicken was great but the chicken itself was under seasoned.  Was looking forward to the mac 'n cheese but it too failed to impress.  It was basically stove top mac 'n cheese then finished off in the oven leaving the top a bit too dry for my liking.  Again it also  lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious last night. The service was TERRIBLE (they forgot about us for about 45 minutes when it was time for dessert), the food was disgusting, and two members of my group got FOOD POISONING. Yes that's right. Food poisoning. 

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was later in the evening for dessert. There weren't many other customers. My partner and I had good drinks and good desserts and decided we'd have to return for dinner. 

Some time later, we finally returned for dinner. The food was pretty good (chicken and waffles and short ribs) and our drinks were OK, but not spectacular. Our server was sweet, but the place was full and she couldn't get around to everyone in a reasonable amount of time. A place the size of Harlem Underground should have at least two servers on the floor. 

The space is sort of dark and mysterious. There's a large open window at the front, which allows for some good people watching."}
{"text":"We went to Harlem for a goodbye dinner for one of the attorneys at my firm. This is not an atmosphere that a bunch of Bay Street lawyers would usually go too, but we all loved it. From the service, to the food and music. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and boy was it amazing. It had the right amount of wine, juice and fruit. The rest of the table had other drinks that they were very pleased with. We ordered the platter that came with a bit of everything, my favourite were the corn break and jerk quesadillas. For the main course I had friend chicken and you get to chose your side, coconut rice and peas or Mac and cheese. I also got to try the short rib, and it was mouth watering. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recent warm evening to enjoy the patio and have a casual dinner. For the quality of food this place is definitely overpriced. Drinks are too. $9 for a cocktail? $6 for a bottle of Red Stripe?!? Generally the food is bland and unexciting. For a place that has so much cuisine to draw on (creole, Caribbean) it really falls flat.

Jerk chicken should be face-meltingly hot - I don't mind if you Canadian-ize the dish but at least keep it somewhat hot. It was more like chicken with sweet BBQ sauce on it."}
{"text":"We stopped here solely because of the Bloody Jerk. The actual Bloody Mary drink itself is just average but the fixin's attached are a meal. We ordered just the Bloody and a side of plantains and we were full. Definitely check out this spot if you like bloodies."}
{"text":"The Coconut Fettucine from Irie is still on the menu at both Harlem and Harlem Underground. Yayyyyy!!!! Coconut Fettucine is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Ever."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a casual fun night out. Great food, cool atmosphere, live entertainment but still able to chat. The owner came over to talk with us for a bit when he heard us asking about the original location. He was a very nice guy and obviously passionate about this place. Chicken and Waffles is definitely the way to go. I wanted catfish but was disappointed with it. It was breaded and deep fried. Not too much flavour. Same with the okra side. I was expecting cajun style but it was breaded and fried. Still enjoyed the evening, though."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends for a birthday and we had a reservation of 6 people. The place was pretty quiet when we got there at around 6 p.m. but there were a few more tables as the night progressed. When everyone arrived, the server came to take our drink orders and gave us a rundown of the menu. 

I ordered the Guinness marinated stewed chicken with a side of fried pickles and my girlfriend ordered the Jambalaya with a side of candied plantains. The Guinness marinated stewed chicken was really soft and tender but otherwise it was average. The fried pickles were battered with tempura batter which got a little soggy but I enjoyed the sauce that it came with. The Jambalaya had some heat and I could only take a few bites (although my girlfriend, who doesn't eat spicy food, ate it like a champ). It was really strong and peppery and that was pretty much all I could taste."}
{"text":"Cozy spot on a cool stretch of Queen St West.

Loved the dimly lit, red-walled look...and the boogy-woogy jazz pianist was a really nice touch (apparently he plays there a few nights a week; on Thursdays he plays with a trio). Gave this place a N'awlins vibe, very cool.

We started off with the Harlem Crisps served with avocado-ginger hummus; and Catfish Lafayette, deep-fried catfish morsels served with sweet hot sauce. Both were extremely tasty, though high-cal for sure.

Continuing on that theme, I ordered the Fried chicken & waffles----which was SUPER crispy, moist inside...just right. As for the waffles I could take 'em or leave 'em. But the dish comes in three ways, either with waffles/gravy/corriander-lime syrup OR with your choice of collards/mac n cheese or coconut rice/peas (confusing, I know). Next time I'd probably get the collards/mac and just ask for the lime syrup, which is great for chicken dippin. Hubby ordered the BBQ jerk chicken which he thought was excellent.

Cool spot. Recommended"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmmmm omnomnomnom!! chicken and waffles and catfish lafayette!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and it was nothing the menu described it to be. 
The strawberry waffles (1/5) came with a strawberry soup poured on top and melted whipped cream. It looked so bad that I wasn't able to eat it and they didn't even take 1.00 off the bill after the waitress said 'you didn't like it huh...' and laughed. I said 'no'
The jerk chicken sandwich (3/5) hardly had any chicken on it, instead they filled it with plantain. But the flavorcc was good. 
The festivals (1/5) were dry and the presentation was horrible. 
dessert: candied plantain (2/5)

The service was not good. 2 younger waitress yelling at each other whether or not to seat people. 
Didn't check on us or refill our water. 

Ps. No option for sides as they were out of everything except baby greens"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! Had the veggie omelet. It came with some delicious cornbread, a tossed salad. The chef's own special hot sauce was a perfect add on."}
{"text":"Great grub but the slowest service ever. We had to wait for over twenty minutes to order and over thirty just to pay. Finally we had to walk to the counter to ask for the debit machine. 

If you do venture out, try the bacon mac and cheese! And of course, the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Good hearty meal. You can order some of the classics like jerk chicken, short ribs and rice, etc, just like your mom your grandmother used to make. It's nice to be able to order some of the other stuff too like Chicken and Waffles. The cocktail specials are also not bad. 

Pricing is okay. The review I'm going to give overall is like a 3.5/5.0. It's not super amazing but if this is the type of food you want, they have it. Went here before going out for the night and it's good \"like momma, grandma, auntie\" would cook and it's perfect for a pre-drinking meal.

Happy to visit here and happy to try it."}
{"text":"Yep. Epic BBQ !!! Ate there today with the fam and had great service. The family ordered a whole bunch of goodies. My fav was the BBQ chicken bites - so spicy and DELICIOUS!!!   the ribs were also really REALLY Good! We had some red stripes and some cornbread. Mac and cheese and BBQ jerk chicken. All super fab! They even made a grilled cheese for one of our kids who's a little on the fussy side! He enjoyed the meal too. Overall friendly service and really great food. Will be back 100 percent!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, but i found the food took a long time and was cold when it arrived. It would have been tasty if it arrived hot. The chairs are super uncomfortable, I was squirming half way through the meal."}
{"text":"These are the best chicken and waffles Toronto's got to offer. 'Nuff said. Go check them out!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food, however we never got that far.

Only two people were working on a busy Thursday night.

My date and were seated, given menus and some water, and were told they would be back in a minute to take our drinks and menu order.

Time passed, our waiter walked by us multiple times, sat another party (who was also served beer before us) left the restaurant with his phone in his hands, only to come back to serve the other patrons.

30 minutes passed and we were not even told they would get to us soon.

We got up and left, and not one person said anything to us.

Will never go back and will advise others not to visit either."}
{"text":"Food was EXCELLENT... The best ever by far of my Canada  experience.  Highly recommend  the Chicken and waffles, mac and cheese, cornbread  and the gravy speaks for itself... great staff!!!!"}
{"text":"So after going back and forth on scheduling, and figuring out a time when we could all go together, my friends and I collectively decided that last night was the perfect night for some chicken and waffles. I've never had the dish before, and didn't really know what to expect., but man we were excited to get our eat on. We headed down to the Harlem Underground on Queen West and ordered what was the most artery clogging feast of our lives, so far.

From what I've been told, the Richmond St. location of the restaurant has a different menu and is much healthier. I'd like to go there to see what they offer, but the Queen West location is great-a little on the pricey side, but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Overall very disappointing. The owner needs to hire a serious chef with talent. Only a complete idiot would like chicken drenched in half a bottle of BBQ sauce!

As well, hire server staff who are reasonable and engaged in their job. Our waitress was in the twilight zone or on dope.

Give this half-baked place a miss."}
{"text":"After having a really positive experience at Harlem on Richmond Street, I came here with 5 other friends for a get-together dinner on a weekday evening. The food was comparable to the Harlem on Richmond, although it seemed smaller in portion, the authentic Creole and Southern flavor was there; however, the service a huge let-down. 

First of all, our water took forever to arrive, without any ice, on a hot early summer day. The waitress was nowhere to be seen throughout the entire dinner, although there was only one other table at the restaurant. A few times we saw her, she was eating her own dinner and pouring herself a drink behind the bar. Service was non-existent, no water re-fills, no small talks, and it took her 15 minutes to bring the bill when we eventually got her attention. 

When we received the bill, there was a mandatory 15% tip given our party's size, fair. But this is where it gets even more interesting with the waitress, one of my friends gave a $40 bill for her $26 dinner, only to receive $11 back with a shrug from the waitress claiming there was no more change at the registry. We were shocked but also rushing to leave for our next appointment, so we let it go. Needless to say, it left a bad taste in our mouths (not because of the $2 my friend never got back, but because of her lack of service and her sense of entitlement that she would get tipped on top of the 15% on our bills). 

Will I ever want to pay for $30 for a small dish of blackened catfish, and receive next to no service? Probably not."}
{"text":"Fried chicken & waffles.

Most unusual combination.

Or not ;)

It was one of those days. And Harlem was just the place for a little soul food. A classic Southern gluttonous experience of finger-licking good.

You've never seen a table so excited to scan a menu. Scan it we did...over and over again. Appetizers: catfish lafayette or bayou baked brie? Entreés: jambalaya or braised short ribs? Sides: mac n' cheese or corn bread? We debated like it was our last meal. 

Stand-out dishes:

Catfish Lafayette
(seasoned deep fried morsels of succulent fish w/ a great sweet & hot sauce + jerk scallion mayo)

Cajun Tempura Fried Okra
(part of 2% of population who loves okra. don't care. pair that w. a crispy tempura batter, satisfying!)

Honourable mentions:

Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle with a chipolte-coriander-lime maple syrup
(crackling skin & juicy meat, combined with sweet waffles smothered in syrup...comfort food at its best)


It pains, but unforgettable:

Braised short ribs seared & slow simmered in rich thyme-molasses-scotch bonnet pepper & veg stew
(N enjoyed, but wasn't blown away & it was a little too fatty for our liking)

Fried Plantains
(sticky...in a \"hold pls, need to unlock jaw first\" kinda way)

Great, casual, easy vibe. Serving Cajun & Creole, Harlem (Underground) is good.

Too good. Once-in-a-quarter-let-it-all-go-good."}
{"text":"Was here on a beautiful thursday afternoon for lunch and there was absolutely nobody in there at all
I was pondering why but it soon came to my realization when I saw the prices and quality of food...looking at $10 plus for lunch meals
Ordered the catfish salad and roasted jerk chicken sandwich
If you can't take too much salt then stay away from the catfish
It was soooooo salty that I had 3 glasses of water
The chicken sandwich was not bad but it was definitely not a jerk chicken taste, rather a Swiss chalet roasted chicken

Overall If your looking for Cajun food then stay away from this place"}
{"text":"I came here for the Chicken & Waffles and it was so worth it. I'm not sure how many places in Toronto serve Chicken & Waffles but I can't imagine any being better than here. I came here for lunch and the chicken & waffles were served with syrup, gravy, and sweet chili sauce (I'm assuming to use in any combination you desire). I don't think I've had better fried chicken in my life. I spent 8 days in Toronto and this was the best meal I had. I also went to the affiliated restaurant Harlem (on Richmond St E) to have Chicken & Waffles a second time. I went there for dinner and that time the chicken came with the sweet chili sauce drizzled over top and some cooked greens on the side. I'm not sure if the difference in how the dish was served was due to the time of day or the difference between one location to another. Either way it was delicious both times!"}
{"text":"Went during winterlicious. Rushed service. Food came out way too fast - while we were still eating our apps. I had the beet salad for the app, veggie lady meal (or something) for the main, brownie for the dessert. Everything was just ... okay."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I've been to both Harlem restaurants and there is a big discrepancy between the two restaurants. The one on Queen St W is much better than the one on Richmond St for some reason.

I came here for lunch and I knew exactly what I wanted to order since I read through the menu online the night before.

I got deep fried pickles which was made well in my opinion because I know it's hard to keep the batter on the pickles.

I've never had cornbread before and I wasn't disappointed at all. It was sweet and moist.

The mac-n-cheese was not amazing. I don't understand why it's considered a must have item according to many blogs and reviews. Personally I prefer KD's mac-n-cheese.

The main entree I got was the Harlem sandwich with sweet potato fries. If you read the description on the menu, it may put you off but I guarantee you that the combination of all the layers was delicious. I think about the sandwich from time to time and if only the restaurant wasn't so far away from where I live, I would go there more often. The sweet potato fries was nice and crispy too!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my sister's birthday with a party of 10. Our waitress Simi was amazing. I would come back for her service alone. Luckily the food was equally delightful. We ordered numerous things on the menu, including the roti, jerk chicken quesadilla, jerk burger and jerk chicken sandwich. Everything was amazing and I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with some Yelp friends on Sunday and ordered the (in)famous fried chicken & waffle combo.  I don't think I've ever had \"real\" fried chicken before (KFC doesn't count), so I was curious to try it, and waffles are among my favorite.

My only big complaint was the spicy maple syrup...I just don't think it works for me. I tried it with the chicken AND the waffle, but I quickly asked for some regular syrup, which was far better. This seems like a case of trying to fix something that ain't broken if you ask me. It's worth noting that I have fairly strong feelings about maple syrup, so if you're the sort of person who can take it or leave it you might not care.

I liked the uber-crispiness of the chicken, but I could only eat one piece as I found it incredibly rich. As Lauren M noted, the waffles were a bit dry. I think they needed some fruit or butter, although there was still too much food for me to finish (and I came here as hungry as humanly possible). You might want to consider ordering this combo to share and adding a few sides!

Bathrooms are clean and the service was pleasant and timely."}
{"text":"Food was Delicious! Came for brunch and the eggs Bennie and chicken and waffles were amazing! Our last meal before leaving Toronto didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday around dinner time. Originally what brought us here was the reviews about the great patio.

Patio was nice but it ends there. The food was AWFUL and way over priced. Everything tasted low quality and frozen warmed up food. I felt totally disappointed leaving this restaurant and would not recommend coming as there are way better options for patios with a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place! Came here for Summerlicious dinner with a friend, and we were blown away by our entrees (BBQ jerk chicken/chicken and waffles). The portion sizes were very decent and everything was delicious. The appetizers (salad/catfish lafayette) were good, but wasn't special in any way. Dessert really was a let down. We had both ordered the brownie with vanilla ice cream, and what we got was a tiny, dry brownie and a half scoop of ice cream. The brownie looked and tasted like it came from a box and had been left sitting in the open for a day or two. Given how great the entrees were, we overlooked the dessert mishap. Then the bills came. Summerlicious at Harlem was $28, which we thought was very reasonable. However, an 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill, which we did not appreciate. I've heard of gratuity being added on for large parties of 6+ people (and even then it's stated on the menu somewhere), but I've NEVER been forced to pay 18% gratuity for a party of 2. The service we received was okay at best, but really I would just like to tip based on my experience with the service, instead of having it applied directly to my bill. I'm hoping this only happened because we came for Summerlicious, and not normally, because I really would like to come back for the chicken and waffles but I'm concerned about the service!"}
{"text":"The restaurant does not return your phone calls for reservaations. No one picks up the phone. It goes directly to voicemail. Even though there was no call back, my friends and I really wanted to try the restaurant. Bad mistake: the service is really slow. We came at 4:30 p.m., there were no customers in the restaurant. It took a long for a waiter to see us, and it took over 40 minutes for our meals. The meal came out soggy and cold. We tried to get our waiter, but no one came. When she finally came back, we told her about our experience, and she pretended that we had no idea what we were talking about. I asked to speak to a manager, but no one came. We decided to leave, and we will never come back.

Don't waste your time and money here. The food and the service is really terrible."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this yesterday at Harlem Underground.  He had been craving mac 'n cheese and when I looked online, Harlem Underground popped up as having one of the best in Toronto.

Gord ordered Southern Fried Chicken with mac 'n cheese (and bacon).  He said it was a delicious dish and he would get it again.

I ordered Jerk Smoked BBQ Chicken with coconut rice 'n peas (but no kale).  It too was delicious.  The BBQ sauce had a bit of a kick.  I'd get it again.

Lamar was our server and he took good care of us."}
{"text":"Not the best southern and creole food - definitely not the worst. 

There's a lot of chicken on the menu for sure. And they do it well.
The place is funky - it's cool. The food isn't trying to be - it just is and they do an ok job at it.

All in all, this isn't a 'transport your self' experience, it's a good place to hang out with friends and enjoy is good evening/brunch in a place with good service, not bad food, and some cool drinks."}
{"text":"Went here last night after having a busy afternoon with the cousins at Pursuit OCR. So you could believe we were hungry.

Out of the eight of us, three got chicken and waffles, three got the southern fried chicken and I of course had to be different and got the jerk bbq chicken. The food itself was delicious. I ordered the catfish layfette as a start because I know for a fact no one in my family has tried it and I absolutely love it. I definitely was not disappointed at the food at all.

The service was just the same, there was no let down there. When my family and I get together we are unintentionally a huge annoyance. However he seemed pretty chill when he was around and he could hear our conversation.

Overall great time! Thank you"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what we ate
the goats cheese salad was so so and the sweet potato fries overcooked.
Service was friendly but slow

Great patio"}
{"text":"Great place to spend a Sunday aftetnoon....try the back patio, try the catfish and nourish the soul"}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to trying this restaurant, what a huge disappointment.  I went for summerliscious.  Had the corn bread appetizer, which was dry, the breaded cat fish with salad as a main (soggy fish), and finished off with the plantains and ice cream.  But they brought out plantains with whip cream because they ran out of ice cream, however, they never mentioned this when we placed the order, or else I would not have ordered the plantains; I guess they were hoping people missed the 'served with ice cream' printed at the top of the list of dessert choices???  Then, we ask for the bill and there was an 18% gratuity added (we were a group of three).  On a positive note, my mom's waffle and chicken was nicely done (for that, I would give a 4/5)."}
{"text":"So I am torn on this place
For starters I will not ever be returning
Food isn't anything special, nor is the environment.
Also the bar tender/waitress/hostess is so bored with his job it shows(yes it was a one man show)
I'll be quick cause really the place is just so underwhelming
Appetizers: Buffalo chicken and spring rolls -both tasted like they came from the grocery store freezer. Generic taste full of grease but good, just not restaurant quality at all
Mains: Smoked jerk BBQ w mac/cheese and Jambalaya - mac and cheese was really cheesy quite tasty as well. Smoked jerk bbq was what my bf ordered and he really enjoyed it mac and cheese was it side instead of rice. They give you a full size portion of mac and cheese as your side which was a delightful surprise.
The jambalaya however was a mess. Over cooked catfish and everything else. Was quite gross to be honest. Imagine over cooked pad thai noodles, that's exactly what my jambalaya tasted like beyond disappointed. Such a waste
Didn't even bother complain as its not my style, just left the plate of food didn't even order drinks or dessert as the disappointment was real"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a friends birthday dinner! 
Decent fried chicken & waffles - although minus 1 star for the cold, soft waffles that seems like it's been pre-made wayyyy in advance! 
Almost like when I make waffles at home and it has been left overnight! Soft and cold! Unlike the crispy fresh ones I was hoping for! But the fried chicken however was delish! ESP goes nicely with the hot sauce we asked for, scotch bonnet? Soooo good! Also what's up with the tiny bit of creamy coleslaw on my plate? 
My date had the smoked jerk pork hock with coconut rice & beans which had a smokey flavour! 
Server that looked like Juliette Lewis was funny & awesome remember all our names despite the fact that we were a party of close to 25 ppl!"}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious lunch. It was not good. Not worth it. They seem to not know how to cook at this place. Got the eggs benny, wasn't yolky like it should be, the cornbread it was served over was very sugary. Got the plaintain for desert, also cooked improperly, the plantain was hard on the inside, but yet again they made up for that with a shit ton of sugar. All of the above sucks even more  because the waitstaff was attentive, very nice, and not deserving of this review."}
{"text":"On the hunt for a line-less Sunday brunch we easily found seats at Harlem. Who knew they had food besides chicken and waffles?!

Fried okra: really pleasant. great crispy batter and a nice dipping sauce to go with. Good as a side but make sure it cools down before biting :( #lessonlearned

Papa Was A Rolling Oat: one of their brunch offerings. Hearty pancakes with I believe plantain and not banana slices, but not an overwhelming amount. It's a huge portion.

Irie Roti: another humongous portion. a boatload of curried chicken stuffed into a roti. Full of flavor with heat. Can easily be shared between 2 people but good luck trying to cut the thing in half."}
{"text":"Hrmm....

I really liked the atmosphere at Harlem, lovely dark little place with cool decor. Bathrooms downstairs were a nice surprise. Outside patio looked great (too bad it's November). The service was excellent.

What failed to impress me was the food. Don't get me wrong, it was OK, but I think I had high expectations after several yelpers raved. 

I went against my intuition and ordered the fried chicken & waffle combo as I was told I would regret not ordering it. I'm not much of a fried chicken fan to begin with so I should have stuck to my guns.

The waffle was just meh. Plain waffle, a bit dry. It came with some chipotle lime maple syrup stuff on the side but no butter. (Pancakes & waffles should have butter, non?) The chicken was good to look at, nicely battered with what looked like a cornflake batter. I thought it was bland though - where's the kick? No hint of spicyness or saltiness. The dish was served with a side salad topped with some fruits. Overall, an OK meal but not something I'd order again."}
{"text":"This place is more like a 2.5 but can easily be a three if they get a proper barista. Coffee is very important to me for a brunch which is why the rating is so low though the food was good.

We went for brunch and it was pretty good. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Harlem Benny. My guy enjoyed his brunch item but I'm a little more picky. I really think instead of serving the sauces in plastic cups, HU might invest in some nice steel cups or even just drizzle the sauces directly on the meal. The plastic cups just make the whole thing look cheap. I have a feeling the gravy served was of the packet variety, homemade gravy tastes a little more fuller than the packaged variety (I could be wrong).

My chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffle was soft and spongy, a nice contrast to the crispy chicken. I really enjoyed the scotch bonnet syrup!

On to the coffee. I ordered a latte and he ordered his regular black drip. His coffee tasted pretty awful, and it was just black drip. My latte was way too milky, not foamed properly and the espresso was weak (as in I didn't taste any).

Service was decent as the restaurant was pretty empty. So hire a better barista (or train staff better) and stop using cheap plastic cups."}
{"text":"This place deserves greater than five stars. It is literally happiness for the taste buds. Great ambiance, friendly staff and fantastic food. The bacon mac and cheese is delicious. The chicken and waffles comes with the most delectable gravy ever. This is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"After raving about Harlem Underground to people, it pains me to have had a mediocre experience there. We were a group of six hungry diners who were ready to eat. We ordered caesars and red stripes, a round of appetizers, mains and sides. The server was not able to give a recommendation and seemed terribly confused. Our apps came without a hitch, the catfish layfeyette (battered and fried catfish) was moist and well seasoned with two dipping sauces, but the crawfish in chilies was underwhelming and overly finicky for the taste experience. 

Our server seemed to stop noticing us at this point, we had difficulty having drink orders fulfilled. When our mains arrived they hadn't remembered to order one of them. The rest of us awkwardly ate our entire meal while our friend waited for almost 20 minutes for his food. There was no profuse apology or rush to get it out once they realized their mistake. 
The fried chicken was good enough, but waffles and gravy was stone-cold. The mac n' cheese was bland. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw, which isn't enough for me to want to return. 

To top it all off, groups of 6 or more have an automatic tip on the bill - when the main didn't arrive, we expected it to be discounted at the very least and we did not intend on tipping the full amount. After we asked awkwardly, they deducted 50% of the main from the bill. So much drama when all we wanted was some good ol' fried chicken."}
{"text":"I ordered: Jerk chicken quesadillas, mac and cheese, festivals. 
All really good dishes, I found the festivals to be a little too sweet for my liking. But everything else was good. Mac and cheese had the right consistency and creaminess. The jerk chicken quesadillas were sweet, creamy, spicy and savoury. Just a lot of jam packed flavour that went really well together. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and will be back for chicken and waffles really soon!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of the food, as I was on a liquid diet that night ;-)  

The Jazz was absolutely great.  It was a fusion of lounge jazz, with Indian sitar.  What a treat to live in a city like Toronto and enjoy quality fusion Jazz on a Monday night!  

They have a different house drink every night of the week.  That night it was a refreshing mix of rum and ginger beer.  It came with complimentary house chips.  Single open bar items were reasonable at $5.

The atmosphere is very nice.  The menu seemed quite reasonable, price wise."}
{"text":"Food was great, but service very poor...

Went there for late brunch on a Saturday. Place was full, but we managed to get a table..However nobody helped us so we basically had to get seated by ourselves. They had one (!) waitress tending all the tables... After 15min without even being recognized we decided this wasnt their day and left... 

an hour later we passed them again and saw they had gotten reinforcement in additional staff and we decided to give them another shot given we had heard good things... Service still shit, but at least we were able to order (the waitress was so rushed that we had to bring her back twice to complete the order)... Anyway, you get the idea...wasnt their day, staff completely overwhelmed...

Food was great though. Loved it and will come back for that. Fried chicken was great, waffles and everything else."}
{"text":"I might be a bit ignorant in this regard, but I expected all the service staff here to be black.  But we got a french (I think ) server, who happened to be really friendly.  

Another thing I was expecting was that this place would actually be underground, but it's not... with the exception of the bathrooms.  

Okay so overall...

- food was okay, price was fair - not overly expensive like many restaurants in TO
- service was good, but they did not offer separate bills for our party (10+ ppl)
- nothing on tap, beer in bottles only - which is fine

I would come back, and next time I'm going to try the friend chicken and waffles!

{"text":"After making a reservation for a Friday night dinner, I was contacted by Susie in order to confirm the details and discovered I'd booked at the Richmond Street location and meant to book at the Queen Street location. Susie quickly transferred my booking with no issues.

I'd been daydreaming about chicken and waffles for 2 weeks prior to this so needless to say I built up expectations in my head and when it quickly arrived at our table I was glad to discover my expectations weren't only met but exceeded. I understand that chicken and waffles isn't exactly a difficult dish, but it is easy to screw up. Everything was done very well and the 3 sauces provided ensured that the flavour combinations were wide. The server even gave me a side of their scotch bonnet hot sauce which was very good too.

In addition to this, we also tried the Harlem Mugger drink special which was also very good. 

I'd like to also note that the piano player that is usually there was not present that night. Although this was my first time at Harlem Underground, I've been told that it can get quite loud while he plays. The music chosen to fill in for him was quite good and I am always relieved when restaurant staff don't treat this dining aspect as their own personal playlist.

Everything fell right into place that night from the ambiance, service and food quality. I hesitate to give anything 5 stars, but looking back on that dinner makes me instantly want to return. Well done Harlem Underground."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, my go-to here is always the chicken and waffles. I've also been to the other (now closed) location- food is more or less the same to me between both locations. It's very reasonably priced compared to other brunch places, plus I love the sauces that it comes with. It's not a popular \"instagram brunch spot\", so you'll almost never find a line on a Saturday or Sunday morning (which to me is a huge plus). 

The environment is soulful and geared more towards a Jamaican vibe. Music may be a hit or miss... in my most recent trip, they were banging out club music at 10am in the morning and I got a massive headache. But after a while, they switched to softer music so perhaps they forgot to switch the CD from the previous night or something.. I've previously never had any problems with this, so I'd like to think this was a one-off."}
{"text":"Chicken. And. Waffles. What else do you need to know: everything I've ever had was delicious and the portions are deceptively filling. 

ALSO: Jerk Meatloaf. Heaven."}
{"text":"Harlem Underground sure makes me feel like transferring from a nice Autumn afternoon to a dungeon that is dark and only source of light is from the window on the far end of the dining room.

- Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle With a Chipolte-corriander-lime maple syrup ($11.95)
I am no friend of fried chickens doesn't how good you make it sounded I really cannot order fried chicken without guilt and lie about my experience. I am so glad that someone nice willing to share his with me. 1 piece is all I need... I have to say it is not bad, I do love the syrup that comes with it. Yes Yes I know deep fried chicken is the way to go to preserve all the moisture inside the chicken. 
The Waffle I found them dry, and I love freshly made off the iron waffle... and this is really disappointing for me!

- Harlem Benny Poached eggs, chili-garlic greens, atop a sausage and grits flap jack along with cheesy hollandaise ($10.95)
The eggs were cooked perfectly... but sausage and grits flapjack.. I really don't taste much.. more like a soggy doughy pancake?? The chili-garlic greens in between are ok. I find this dish needs a little more kick to it... maybe some Southern hot pepper sauce will help to spice it up?

Thanks for our fellow yelpers making this Sunday brunch memorable.. It is not all about food... is who you are eating or sharing with!! +1 star"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is so damn good and service is great. Good crowd, good music, everything blends together nicely. The chicken waffles and corn bread will make you weak in the knees. If they don't, the servers will."}
{"text":"This gets one star up because the ambience is really bumpin' with the open concept in the back and art on the walls. The menu isn't extensive but it's packing variety.
 
I came here for the hype - the chicken and waffles. The waffle is nice, light and fluffy. The fried chicken that sits atop is crunchy and delicious. Jerk chicken quesadillas were phenomenal here and definitely my top favourite.

I'm not a big fan of fish but I loved the catfish lafayette. If you want something to snack on, try harlem crisps which come with the tasty sauces. The mac 'n cheese is also worth trying. Service was very good. It was empty on the nights we've been here but the waiters were great even when it picked up."}
{"text":"Food was great, music was great and the entire atmosphere was awesome. I still don't understand whether there is live music or not.

{"text":"The food was great, cocktails were well crafted and the staff was so warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"This was the first stop on my Winterlicious food tour this season. I choose this restaurant because I felt like some soul/southern comfort food. This place hit the spot! We made reservations for 3 for 2pm. The gps said the restaurant was about 30 mins from my house so we made arrangements to leave early because we haven't been to this part of the city before. We were still late and the reason for this is because if your not an expert of the parallel park then that's going to be an issue. It took me 3 attempts but I managed to squeeze into a spot with the help of my girls. 

Now this restaurant is tiny, a true gem in the wall. Very unique form of design with great service. Our server was friendly and went the extra step to make us feel like our business was appreciated. Their menus are printed on what looks to be an old school vinyl record. Love the concept.

As being there for Winterlicious, we had a set menu to choose from. I chose the Deep fried pickles as my appetizer. I have to say I was a little, ok maybe a lot disappointed with them. The breading/batter didn't stay on the pickles. The minute you tried to pick it up with your fork you only got pickles.. for the main mean I ordered their signature sandwich called \"The Harlem\" it is a 3 layer Sammy of black forest ham, jerk chicken, avocado, mango mayo, jalapeño havarti, served on a ciabatta bun. It was out of this world!! I don't know how to stress the bust of flavour you get every bite you take. They blend so well that you can't tell what is what. For desert I enjoyed a outstanding mango cream tart that has inspired me to try and create in the comfort of my own home. 

I would return when I'm in the area to try something a bit different. Maybe their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday and I had the Southern Fried Chicken and Waffles. It was really good!!! I recommend it if you are eating here.  One thing that takes away from my review is that service was really slow, but It was probably because there was only one waitress who doubled as a bartender, and one cook. Also, some things seem a little over priced.  Other than that it was great! My friends and I really enjoyed it.  The waitress even brought out my friends birthday cake, and packed it up for us in the end."}
{"text":"the frist impression is that it's a cool soul food place. nice for a dinner for two. came here for apps and drinks, they were ok. the mac and cheese was a bit oily for me, but done in a very classic way. the food being served looked HUGE and delicious. will return to check out food. will say that service was great, the piano man comes around to take requests as well."}
{"text":"You know what grinds my gears? Restaurants that use Winterlicious to rip people off. They charged me $25 (plus tax and automatic tip = $32) for $16 worth of food. 

The mains were fine, exactly as you would have seen on the regular menu. However, the \"appetizer\" was 4 chicken-nugget sized corn bread that were clearly microwaved ( because the bottom was soggy) and thrown haphazardly on a small white plate. Same with the catfish morsels. The \"dessert\" was four slices of mushy candied plantain, again thrown on a plate. the other dessert was a singular mango tart the size and quality of egg tarts (not the Portuguese ones mind you, the $0.33 Asian kind) 

Unbelievable. I know people say don't expect good food at Winterlicious, but I don't expect to be blatantly ripped off like that. Never coming back or supporting any place this owner owns."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst restaurant experience I've had. Music was so loud I couldn't hear myself or my friend, food (spring rolls and crisps) was essentially tasteless, was severely understaffed for a Saturday night and the staff that was there seemed off. I didn't enjoy myself whatsoever, left with a massive headache and sort of sad. I guess the best part about this experience was the Ah Caramel I had immediately after. Would give no stars if I could. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived at Harlem Underground for lunch around 11 am, and there was only one waitress serving all the tables. We were horrified to be informed that lunch was only served after 12 pm, since nothing on the brunch menu really appealed to us. Luckily, the kitchen obliged to serve us items from the lunch menu, so we're pretty happy about the service.

Sides are mostly ordered à la carte here, so we got a whole bunch of them to supplement our meal. First up, deep fried pickles, served with zesty scallion mayonnaise. Unfortunately, the batter didn't really adhere to the pickles and fell off really easily, so this was a difficult snack to maneuver. The mayo dip was also a little runny for my liking.

Next came the Harlem cornbread, which was an absolute delight! Mildly sweet, dense and moist, the cornbread was perfect with the salted butter. I loved the savoury and sweet combination, and the salt in the butter really brought out that innate sweetness in the cornbread. 

I've read many positive reviews on Harlem's mac-n-cheese, but this one didn't exactly live up to my expectations. In fact, it tasted like Kraft dinner.  By the time I was having my second spoonful, I already felt like I was in a food coma.

And the winner of the day goes to...the Harlem: A grilled three layer sammy of black forest ham, jerk chicken salad, avocado, mango mayo and jalapeño Havarti on a challah toast. When this sandwich arrived, I almost gasped in awe- the portion was huge! I'd seen a picture of this sandwich on Harlem's website, and that sandwich looked a lot tinier than this one. I loved the combination of the different textures and flavours of each ingredient. The avocado (my favourite) added a perfect layer of creaminess to this delectable concoction. The best part? The sandwich came with sweet potato fries, which I love, love, love! The intense, sweet flavour of the yam really shone through the fries. 

We left extremely full and satisfied, and I even felt slightly dizzy from all that deep fried goodness! I'll definitely be coming back again for their famous fried chicken!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken and the crunchy thick batter was outstanding. LOVE the cornbread, it had corn bits in it and had just a slight spicy kick to it. The thick gravy tasted standard. The chicken pieces were huge. I the waffles as well and it was soft, thick, and fluffy although I wished they served the fish with more maple syrup.

There was only one waiter serving the entire place on a Thursday night, so it was quite slow. But she was friendly and even allowed me to switch from waffle to cornbread for my dish!"}
{"text":"I've been to their other restaurant on Adelaide St and that experience was great. Can't say the same for this place. The service was really good, our waitress was super nice and attentive, despite it being a busy night and she was the only one working the floor. Two of us ordered the fried chicken, sides of red beans & rice, and collard greens. They give you three pieces of fried chicken with a small side of coleslaw, along with two little samples of gravy and a honey-chipotle sauce (i think that's what it was). The honey sauce didn't do much for me, I would have rather had a bigger helping of gravy. The chicken was a bit over-done for both of us. I'm thinking it could have been made earlier then re-fried quickly before serving? Who knows. The red beans and rice wasn't that tasty. The rice was too plain. Maybe the whole thing was too plain. 

I may try their other location again, but as for the Underground...only if someone else is paying.

UPDATE: after having red beans & rice in NOLA I'd have to say Harlem's version is not even close to the real thing."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and menus shaped like records. A place after my own heart. 

At my most recent stop by here, myself and my brunch companion were hungover and ordered all of the liquids. Water. Coffee. Green Tea. Caesars and then I had their traditional breakfast, which was solid... but a tad overpriced for what it is. I also don't like it when they place runny eggs over everything including the salad, but maybe that's just me. I know this one guy that puts an egg on everything.... WHY?! 

The servers are super laid back and funny and were great at entertaining our hangovers away. I was still in a sweater with a bedazzled Jesus on it from a holiday party the night before, though... so like... who wouldn't want to befriend me? 

PEPPER POINTS: For always bringing the heat with the tune-age."}
