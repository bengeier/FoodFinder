{"text":"J'ai été super satisfaite avec le service. J'ai été surprise par la poutine; la sauce était subtilement sucrée. Ce n'était pas ma préférée, mais j'ai aimé l'expérience. En plus elle a été faite avec beaucoup d'amour. :)"}
{"text":"Ok, let's be honest. You never go to Verdun. You don't want to, and probably never will. 

But after spending a couple years in Montreal, you may develop a passionate love for poutines. Not the kind of drunken one-night stand love, but one of slow savoring of flavors. That's when you start searching for the perfect match.

If I were on a Poutine dating show, no doubt Poutine Lafleur's poutine would in my final two. Fresh fries, fresh curds. Both fulfill the basic requirements. But the sauce. It's rich and peppery. A thick chicken gravy, not too saucy. Your fries won't get mushy. And it gets served in the classic container, none of that pretentious thing called a plate.

If you're serious about finding the best poutine in the city, give this poutine a try (and Maam Bolduc's too, while you're at it) and forget about la banquise, la belle province or Patati Patata. And did I say it's cheap? $4 with taxes for the one pictured above.

edit: This place is NOT to be confused with Lafleur the hotdog chain. It's a local thing, and the real deal."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worse I've had. Small place right on the corner beside the candy store.

The guys who work there are friendly.

My hamburger was not very good last time I went but the hot dogs and fries are fine."}
{"text":"Poutine Lafleur makes a good honest, traditional poutine. The tourists can have La Banquise, Patati Patata and what have you but if you're looking for a blue collar, authentic representation of the real thing, this is the place. You must go here if you're looking for the classic caisse croute experience. 

Yes, it's situated in a slummy part of town but the locals will vouch that Lafleur's makes a quality product. Ask the greasy teenagers. The welfare moms. They're all lining up here on Saturday afternoon for their fix.

What makes this poutine so good? The fries aren't great, it's the typical soft, greasy fresh-cut fry that populates caisse croutes all over Montreal. Just a little bit of crispiness but that's the style. Next up, the gravy, it's got a good chicken base with a bit of bbq seasoning to spice things up. The temperature is on point too, just hot enough to melt the curds but not so much to detract away from the entire experience. Finally, the curds. Squeaky fresh. Bountiful. I wish all poutine purveyors were this generous with their cheese. 

The steamies are just EHHHH. It's not the main attraction and it knows that. 

Poutine is a lot like life: lots of starch, a wee bit greasy and hot at times and one part cheese."}
{"text":"Really solid poutine however....
Delivery was a 2 hour wait and they got my order wrong...and the delivery guy took a couple of minutes to get my change straight, alittle strange.
Not happy at all with my order."}
{"text":"Poutine Lafleur, malgré son nom, n'offre pas davantage de choix en matière de poutine qu'un autre comptoir de restauration rapide. La poutine, tant la régulière que l'italienne, est préparée de manière conventionnelle, mais est toujours bonne. Personnellement, je fréquente surtout l'endroit pour ses hot-dogs vapeur, qui sont les moins chers de la rue Wellington, et que je commande «tout garni et extra chou»."}
{"text":"I really don't like poutine, but my daughter insisted on poutine for breakfast on our last day in Montreal together. We got there on a Sunday morning right at 11am when they opened. They were fast and friendly. You do not come here for fine dining! We ordered a large for $7. It comes in a round foil take out container, whether you eat it there or take it to go. It is very simple. A mound of fries covered in gravy and plentiful cheese curd. As poutine goes, it was pretty good, even if you don't like poutine!"}
{"text":"It might be hard to give an honest review of a fast food joint. Because when you go there, you know you don't expect great good, you just go there because you're a hungry filthy animal. 

And after reading some good reviews about their Poutine, I gave it a try

My mistake was maybe to go for the Italian one since everyone is saying how good the gravy is.
So the bolognaise sauce was ok, the fries were greasy and I went out feeling like I had gained 10 pounds.

It's one of these local experiment, when you go in, it smelled like a \"friterie\" in France or Belgium, and it brought back memories for me. It's bad for you but you don't care. 

And it's cheap. 4 to 8$ for the different poutines, they have a few. 

Give it a try. Regret it but don't complain. You had what you asked for."}
{"text":"Great poutine, even greater prices!

You can't go wrong ordering a poutine here, it's one of my favourite places. It's somewhat out of the way from where I live but whenever I'm in the area I try to order from them"}
{"text":"This place isn't particularly enticing as a destination. It's a fast food place and not a hipster one. Either you're into that or you're not.

I passed over a few artisanal options for something a little simpler, faster, less pretentious. Plus, they're making the fries to order. Somehow they're still shitty, but in the best way possible.

I took the first bite and realized it's been a while since I had poutine that actually squeaked. This poutine is the real deal."}
{"text":"Depuis un peu plus qu'un mois, j'ai de la visite chez moi. Au total, 3 couples différents, tous d'Australie ont habités avec nous. Je suis donc un peu, beaucoup tannée de faire le tour des même coins touristiques. Pour célébrer le retour à la normale et finir cette saison des visites familiales, on a décidé de souligner l'occasion avec de la bonne poutine.

On s'est rendu chez Poutine Lafleur parce que je l'avais vu mentionné à quelques reprises comme étant un des meilleurs endroits pour ce fameux met québécois. Je n'ai pas été déçue du tout de ma poutine mais je n'ai pas non plus été impressionnée. Les frites étaient bonnes, le fromage faisait \"squeak-squeak\" et la sauce était bonne sans être graisseuse ou trop salée. Les poster des Canadiens ont fait de l'expérience, un bon classique québécois, rien de plus, rien de moins."}
{"text":"This is a fast food joint... Great traditional poutine with great gravy."}
