{"text":"the Italian poutine was good the price was fair too but the fact that they don't take debit or credit is weird you need to use their ATM and of course that come with 3 $ fee that it could be avoided but beside that the service was normal and the decor inside was nice i would probably come back to check their other poutine"}
{"text":"WORST-EXPERIENCE-EVER. If the food doesn't kill you the late at night weekend crowd will surely do it. Situated between a highway and hell, this criminal's den is a haven for low-class prostitutes from the strip tease next door, their pimps and young trouble makers who congregate there before heading home towards the north end of town. I almost got mugged and beaten-up while waiting in line only to be ripped off by the fat and sweaty restaurant manager who grabbed my money and almost didn't return my change. Cops were waiting to nearby as it is a known trouble-spot."}
{"text":"La belle province DÃ©carie taken over by new owners fully renovated!! And amazingly clean ! Service is amazing food was great :)"}
{"text":"I've been living in Montreal for the past nine years, and I've never been to La Belle Province, why? Because I'm not a big fan of that kind of junk food. But when you have kids who ask you to go, well, at one point you end up giving in to their request to try, because after all, why not? We went around 6pm, I did not order anything for me, but the boys each had a cheeseburger kid meal.

They took our orders quickly, but the service was a little slow. They seemed to be confused about the very simple content of my order. When our order arrived, I tasted some french fries and I had the impression of eating oil, the cheeseburgers were not bad though.

Despite the beautiful neon lights of the ceiling and the vintage look of the place, you will quickly notice that this restaurant needs maintenance: There are several huge holes in the ceiling and the painting on the walls are flaking. They apparently have new owners, which I hope will restore the splendor of that place, because for now we are far from my definition of a clean place serving food to clients."}
{"text":"Many of my Montreal friends literally grew up on BellePro. Affordable, fast, and generally pretty solid food. I usually go for the cheeseburger, but sometimes I'll have the poutine and an occasional hot dog. Another plus is that BellePro is open later than most places, which is convenient for a night owl like myself. The staff at this particular BellePro are typically pretty nice, which is also a plus."}
{"text":"By far some of the shitest start in history! There's a fat Greek guy that works the graveyard shift. ..what a douchebag, insults customers, gives so much lip.  Pity because place is decent looking and food is relatively pk for a belle pro. This Is how good places go under, by crappy staff thinking they are doing the customer a favor. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"This is a 3 star rating based on similar places. I don't know what The F. is talking about, but having grown up not too far away, and have been to La Belle over 20 times past midnight I can can safely attest to making it out without problems each time. Sure, it's kinda grimy, but in that greasy casse-croute kind of way...and if you visit often they remember you and give you some slightly friendly banter. In the middle of night, of course the more seedy folks will be hanging out, but what the heck do you expect - it's next door to a cheap strip club! I find it similar to any other fast food restaurant open that late.

Ok so down to the food: the poutine is my one of my faves, it even made my husband into a believer (in poutine, that is). The burgers are pretty good, and the hot dogs are your standard Montreal-style. You can also get subs (which are good but so bad for you), Greek pitas, club sandwiches, and so on. Stick to the basics and you'll be set. Here's my issue: they can be inconsistent - once there was a gritty potato that made it into my hubby's poutine. It happens when you make fresh cut fries I guess, but they should be more careful. 

So there you go, get in, get your poutine, and get out - the recipe to success."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. This time the spaghetti is crap and the service is shit! Two young people working. I'm sure the other place is better!"}
{"text":"I decided to return here since I felt like an Italian poutine when my previous plans didn't go as expected.

I had heard that this place had changed owners/management somewhat recently so I decided to drop by during the long Canada Day weekend after work.

The place still looked roughly the same except the menu was updated.

I lined up and noticed that even with the change in owners/management, they still don't accept credit cards or debit cards (which is a shame) since every fast food restaurant within walking distance of the area (Harvey's, Burger King, Wendy's, Tim Horton's, McDonald's, & Orange Julip) accepts it (which places this place at a disadvantage). They do have a \"no name\" ATM which will probably charge higher fees to withdraw money. They had their free wireless password at the cash which was nice.

I looked at the Italian poutine price and noticed that they had an Italian poutine with smoke meat price which was less than $1 more expensive so I opted to order the large Italian poutine with smoke meat. The cashier had a problem with my order and asked one of the cooks for help. He charged me for the Italian poutine and looking at the cash, he added ~$3.25 for the smoke meat option. I pointed at the menu on the top and mentioned that this wasn't the price shown. He then said that's what the price is. I then mentioned that I'll just have the large Italian poutine so he cancelled the smoke meat option.

The food was served relatively fast. I was very surprised by the size of the large Italian poutine. It was larger than Italian poutines that I ordered in other places and I couldn't finish it.

Not sure if the air conditioner didn't work or was on low but it was very warm inside the restaurant (which is probably why they opened both of their doors along with trying to get rid of some of the oil smell). On this particular day, it was around 30C and with the humidity probably 35C so it was uncomfortably hot/humid outside and just a little bit better eating inside.

I went back up to the counter and asked one of the cooks if I could get a cover for my tinfoil container and he obliged."}
{"text":"I love their all dressed hot dogs here, as well as their Poutines, really delicious! I would give 5 stars but they lose 2 stars (or maybe even 3..) due to cleanliness and sanitary unhygienic employees. The employee who served us was not wearing a uniform, gloves, hair net or anything. After he took our order, he went straight to make the food. He had on a black over sized sweater, which was touching the hot dog buns and he didn't wear gloves, and the whole thing was just really unsanitary.. as delicious as it was, I don't think
I would be returning to this particular location."}
{"text":"I went with my dad for a classic lunch of poutine, steamed hotdogs and fries with vinegar and salt. I got a combo of 2 steamies, a poutine and gave one dog to my dad who ordered a dog and a fries. I inhaled it and had to stop myself from eating the entire poutine. Incidentally this place has like 12 kinds of poutine (bacon, smoked meat, mushroom etc).

Look,it's La Belle Province. It's not haute cuisine, but it was hot, fresh and fast and we had no complaints. I was originally going to give 5 stars but I realize that's ridiculous for a fast food chain :)"}
{"text":"If i owned this place or even just worked there, I would be embarrassed. This place is beyond neglected, I don't think they have even changed a light bulb in this place in the last 10 years. It's dingy, all you see is water stains on the sealing plaster patches everywhere and tape holding the garbage cans together. Very unappetizing! The food is typical \"la belle province\" food. Not great, not terrible."}
