{"text":"Every time I make an attempt go eat here they are always closed. I'm not even sure if they are still operating as a regular restaurant or just a banquet hall.  Very disappointing place."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing, I wanted to like the place but the take-out we got was pretty weak.  It was slopped together and the humus/baba didn't reassemble anything like I've gotten before.  The baba looked curdled, humus was runny, and the small appetizer of tabulleh looked as if it were meant to be a joke/insult.  The food tasted better than it looked, falafels were tasty,  shawarmas & gyros were decent, and service was nice, but the cost and appearance of the food left a bad taste in my mouth and I probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"As a parent this was not the place to take a kid, no kid menu. As an adult I thought it was a huge establishment that should have had more going for it. Perhaps I will try it out again in a couple months because the food was okay but nothing special."}
