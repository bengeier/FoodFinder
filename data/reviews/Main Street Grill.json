{"text":"I liked the food better when it was the original owners. Tho they have made changes and expanded. My burger was not cooked medium but my fries and cake were good."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating at Main Street Grill.  Has a great menu from Breakfast to Gyros.  Staff is always friendly and service has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food is good, the young girls need help with how to take care of guest. Service is poor."}
{"text":"So glad they closed. Owners were not friendly at all!!!! They don't need to be in business."}
{"text":"Good food fair prices. Went for breakfast, and will definitely be going back for lunch/dinner soon."}
{"text":"It's not anywhere close to fine dining, BUT if you are looking for a true Mom & Pop find, this is the place for you.  It's speciality is lunch and has a hearty menu, with lots of great burgers, gyros & chicken sandwiches & wraps. But if you want something a little special, don't be afraid to ask. They'll probably whip it up on the grill for you in no time.  Very reasonable prices & counter service helps keep the tab down. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am a somewhat regular customer at Main Street Grill... (not a whole lot of restaurants in Waxhaw, NC)... but recent visit I tried something new that was fantastic.  Black & Blue Cheese Burger... on grilled rye bread... It was 11 on scale of 10.  Cooked prefectly and melted blu cheese was melted just right..   Not fast food prices, but very reasonable for sure.... friendly service also bonus."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times.  I have been very happy with the selections.   The onion rings taste like frozen ones from a bag, so I would avoid those.  The tator tots are the best side in my opinion and one reason that I keep going there. 

Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome wings when charred on the grill.  My son LOVED the grilled cheese bacon sandwich, my burger was delivered fast and delicious as was the sweet sweet potato fries.  Best part of the meal was By far the friendly service.   We will be sure to make this a regular place to eat!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for lunch if you're in the Waxhaw area. It's fast, friendly and affordable. I've really enjoyed their Carolina Dogs! You get 2 Nathan's Skinless Beef dogs w/ onions, chili, slaw & mustard with a side of fries for $5. Can't beat that for lunch! They toast the buns on the grill along with the dogs. Nice touch. The chili has really good flavor too. If there was any complaint, it's the slaw is a little stringy. It must be the way they cut it. But overall the Carolina Dog is a winner! They also serve breakfast. I haven't tried it yet but I will soon."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews for this place I was hopeful to find a new place in Waxhaw to eat.

We got in at noon and placed our order fairly quickly.  That is the only thing that ended up being fast.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come out.  The waiter dropped it off and went away immediately.  We waited a bit, but ended up having to get our own fork for our salad, our own catchup and mustard, our own straws, and our own napkins.

He never came back!  For refills we had to ask another waiter.  

One hamburger was so underdone the outside was pink and the other was so charred it was black.  We sent the pink one back (again, not with our waiter because he never came back.)

We will not be going back."}
