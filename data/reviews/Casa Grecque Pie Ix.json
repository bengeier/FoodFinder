{"text":"We walk in and right away the ventilation breaks. We sit for a minute and the server comes by and says \"We can't grill anything. You can either have salad or pasta.\" We look at each other and say, \"Not worth it.\" Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Casa Grecque in quite some, but I figured not much would have changed. Its one those \"old reliable\", you know what you're getting into: large portions for reasonable prices, good but not amazing food. And that's exactly what we got.   This location in particular has a semi closed off room (walls but no doors) separated from the rest of the restaurant, perfect for a large group like ours. We were able to mingle and chat without being in someone's way."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my mom. She discovered first.  Pretty classic environment with alcohol bar.    I like their well done steak served with side dish. But the portion is just a little too short to fill up my stomach.  I have to order a second accompanied dish like fried Calamali. Otherwise, it's tasty."}
