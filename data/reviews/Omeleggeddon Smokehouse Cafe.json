{"text":"I originally wanted an omelet so I yelped where to go near me, I chose here and I'm really glad I did! My friend took me for pre birthday brunch and this magical little place is right around the corner. We were warmly greeted and offered menus so we wouldn't have to \"strain our necks\" as soon as we walked in. The service was wonderful as was the food. I decided on the holy cheesus sandwich. My friend had what I believe was the oven roasted chicken panini. We both loved our food! Also the prices are pretty good. My friend and I vowed to go back until we've tried everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, great food with a selection of omlete toppings second to none. Can't wait to go back for a mouth watering muffin, baked fresh daily. Definitely our new Sunday morning breakfast destination!!! You should make it yours too!! My kids said the best they have ever had!!! Well done! See you Tuesday morning!!"}
{"text":"This is a must try for Euclid. We tried the tempura battered Pig Out omelet and the veggie omelet. Both were very good. We also enjoyed the double chocolate bacon muffin. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and kids this morning. Super friendly owner my us feel welcome. My wife and I both had the Omeleggeddon sandwich which was unique and delicious. The kids all had pancakes. We loved the food and the prices are fair, It is worth trying."}
