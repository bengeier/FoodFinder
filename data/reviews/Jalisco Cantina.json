{"text":"My dad likes to try to find the best chicken tortilla soup, so every mexican restaurant we go to is judged by this. The chicken tortilla soup here is clutch. There's shredded chicken,  chessy/spicy broth. Warms the soul."}
{"text":"Jalisco Cantina has an upgraded menu with really good food at a reasonable price. The shrimp and lobster enchiladas ( with rice and black beans) is really incredible. The atmosphere is very laid back and the staff is very friendly. Great place !"}
{"text":"best mexican food ive had in las vegas tacos great enchilada perfect taquitos super wonderful and the nachos!!! omg so f'n good! my new go to spot for mexican cuisine !!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Very reasonable but the real treat is katie who epitomizes what it means to be a great tender of the bar!  Super friendly, very attentive and very easy on the eyes.  I sat at the bar and watched Monday Night Football and enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Since they changed the name (formerly Super Mex), things have gotten better at this location. I'm a big fan of their nachos. Before the remodel, they were good. Now...they're pretty awesome! The grilled chicken nachos are my favorite, but they also have steak, shrimp and a few other options. The servers are friendly and usually pretty good about refills on drinks and chips and salsa. The Ceviche I'd a great way to start your meal. It's big enough for 2 or 3 people to share. Prices are a little more than before but still reasonable. I definitely like the new spin on the place."}
{"text":"I love to toss hearts and flowers when possible...tonight wasn't one of those moments.  We were frequent visitors when this restaurant was SuperMex...decent Mexican food back then at a very reasonable price.  And, silly us, we liked placing those whole crispy tortillas on a napkin and \"fisting\" it to make small pieces...that was kinda' fun.  The food also seemed more flavor.  The interior has been slightly updated and presented nicely.  We arrived before 6pm on a Thursday and it was perhaps 20% full.  We were seated across from a booth which held a large noisy family group (younger kids).  We asked to be moved to a booth far away and were accommodated...only to find the older kids that couldn't fit in the family booth were near us and didn't understand you shouldn't yell to the other table.  We almost left - a relaxing dinner was not to be.  We then inquired about Happy Hour as a cold beer would have been most welcome.  We were informed that Happy Hour was only in the bar section and that the entire menu was also available in the bar.  We asked if the bar permitted smoking and learned yes, it's a smoking bar.  If I recall, Nevada law does not permit served food and smoking in the same room.  We had no desire to smell like a cigarette once home and really would have liked to have been permitted to partake in Happy Hour without being subjected to smoke.  We would have spent just as much, or more, in the restaurant section than the bar section as to us, it's a preferred environment.  This didn't set well with us as we feel an accommodation could have been made knowing we do not want to be with smokers while having our meal.  We ordered a minimal meal, tolerated the very noisy family and left.  I will add that our server was outstanding and that another large family seated at a center table in the room was a delight.  As we had small combinations, I can't attest to the food as it was just average in presentation and flavor.  The fresh salsa was delicious."}
{"text":"The food is edible. When I think of Mexican food, I think of bold spicy flavors, this place is lacking exactly that. I tried substituting flavor with the Tapatio hot sauce that was sitting on the table, however it did not help. I would not eat here again nor will I recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, GREAT VALUE! One of the top Mexican Restaurants in the entire LV Valley. We enjoy this places regularly! Chimichangas (carnitas) are unique!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here because the food is so delicious. The service is usually good as well and I haven't ever had a terrible experience. The chips, salsa, and beans are really yummy and I love the nachos that they have on the menu. So amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Standard typical Americanized \"Mexican\" fare. Good flavors, good menu choices, decent prices. They usually have Groupon's so it makes it even more worth while, but I still go regardless. Better than the standard casino Hispanic restaurant, but nothing amazing. Service is always great, the atmosphere is nice. They're open until midnight which is definitely a plus for me since I work swing. They have a small bar which is open 24 hours, but I'm not sure if the kitchen is. Nice place to go if you want to avoid the casino environment and just get a good meal."}
{"text":"Really good food .  Fresh ingredients and prepared very well.  loved the Omelete.  Great Chorizo"}
{"text":"1.5 stars would be my rating. It was about 9:45pm when I arrived with a friend we were extremely worried when we first arrived due to the fact that we were the only ones inside the restaurant we contemplated on staying but we ended up staying because the Yelp reviews were so \"great\". Bartender was nice very friendly, he didn't seem to be surprise we were the only people there, after 10 min we ordered our food I got the shrimp pizza and my friend got combo fajitas we also got the bacon rapped shrimp as an appetizer  that we heard so much about. The bacon rapped shrimp was \"ok\" it didn't taste like something you would get from a Mexican restaurant and it came with ranch to dip with ?!? I've never heard of Mexicans dipping bacon shrimp into ranch. Anyways the fajitas and the pizza were up next the fajitas were not steaming like they usually are in any other Mexican restaurant so that was automatically a turn off for me my friend gave it an overall rating of 4 out of 10 pretty tasteless and has had way better. My shrimp pizza looked amazing but that's about it the cook put way to much cheese and it over powered the thin crust and the shrimp. My over all rating would be a 6 out of 10. Overall I came to this restaurant thinking it was authentic Mexican and it's not. Maybe because it was late at night and my meal didn't matter but all I'm saying is I probably would enjoyed paying less at Robertos for more flavor. It's sad because the reviews lead me to believe that this place was \"amazing\" which I had high hopes for but this place is just average. And if your looking for AUTHENTIC this is not your place."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! I'm very picky about my rice and beans. I've finally found a place that does it just right! Had the ground beef tacos and the beef was seasoned perfectly. So flavorful!"}
{"text":"I came here years ago - when it was SuperMex. We've been looking for a comfortable Mexican place with good food and good arrive that isn't a take-out place or a total mad house. This place is great. Good service, extremely tasty food and large portions. Full bar with separate bar seating area. We brought home enough for lunch tomorrow. I really recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Seated at a booth that was tight and very uncomfortable.  The table wobbled terribly.  An easy fix that has obviously been ignored !Bean dip was bland and chips seemed a bit stale!  Ordered Chimichanga de Carnitas.  Very dry!  Had to use sour cream to give it flavor and some moisture.  Beans and rice were less than tasty .  Won't be going back !"}
{"text":"This place is usually really good. Today I had the worst possible service. The waitress took about 10 minutes to take the drink order, and went to get it, and forgot a coffee, and just brought waters, she \"remembered\" and took 10 mins to come back with the coffee. She then took the order, quick and easy right, sausage and eggs, and a soup (negative ghost-rider) took over 30 minutes to get the order. She (the waitress) never came to inform what might be going on, or an apology or anything; Finally her assistant dropped off the food, and we did not see the waitress all meal long.   BILL TIME (Chunn-chunn-Chuunnnnnnn): so I ask for the bill, and explained I have an \"Entertainment e-coupon\"... she asked if she can take the phone, I asked, \"do you really need it?\" she said yes, the manager has to see it. I asked if the manager could come to the table if he needed to see it. (my phone does not need to be floating around with people I don't know, for I don't know how long). She said I will get him... yep... you guess, she forgot. I had to walk to the bar to ask for the manager (which wasn't at the bar,like the waitress said), he showed up and used the coupon and handed my bill. While I was trying to pay, I mentioned that his waitress needed some help on being a bit more attentive but its like I was talking to the dirty beer mug in front of me, because he did not acknowledge, just asked me for my card. Then, even though he was in front of a register, he decides to go to another register. I follow him, and then the only words out of his mouth are, \"sign here\" without handing me a pen. When I asked for a pen, he got one, and before the transaction could be completed, he just walked away and left me standing there.   HORRIBLE WAITRESS, HORRIBLE MANAGER!  These are the type of employees that make people not wanna come back.  Very disappointed, as this place is usually pretty OKAY. Never super great, and never super bad... UNTIL TODAY!  I will go back, cause the food is actually pretty decent, but never when these people are there."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! The Mexican pizza needed sour cream and hot sauce- which was a little extra- but good! My husband loved their habanero salsa, but for sure pass on the fried ice cream! It's just frozen ice cream rolled in corn flakes...ew"}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered here was wonderful.  The taquitos are especially delicious,  the margaritas are well made and the prices are fair.  Service has always been fast & friendly.   This is my #1 Mexican spot on the east side."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. Went with a group of 18. Took 15 minutes to order drinks. Took half an hour to order food. Didn't get water until two of our group went to the kitchen and brought back cups of ice and pitchers of water. After we had been there fifty-five minutes they finally brought chips and salsa. At the 90 minute mark several people left. I was getting ready to leave as well when food showed up at 105 minute mark. I had grilled chicken nachos, which were served at that point between no longer warm but not totally cold. My iced tea arrived AFTER I finished what I could eat of the nachos. No manager ever showed up to apologize. No discount ever offered. I had avoided this place since their name change from SuperMex when they wouldn't honor Groupons, saying they were not the same. Big fat BS. When I paid my bill the bank description says SuperMex. Avoid this place. Run from the vacinity. Save your money. Go to Robertos for some Mexican fast food. It is hot, much tastier and they provide great service. Never again will I grace this place with my presence. Applebees screwed up majorly 14 yrs ago. Jalisco Cantino can now join them as places to never ever ever visit. I passed along the misfortunes of my experiences there and with do so with all my friends as regards this place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! Ordered take out of taquitos, guacamole, mini chimichangas & Mexican pizza & it was $40! We thought for that price, servings would be huge- nope. 2 small taquitos & 4 super mini chimichangas, which was only two split in half & each was bite size and dried out. Mexican pizza was big, but tortilla was soggy & chicken wasn't great. Guac was the only thing ok, but certainly not worth $10. Lesson learned - will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious no doubt but unfortunately the service was just horrible maybe next time we get a better service"}
{"text":"Our server, Lisa, was really personable, and she got us drinks and complimentary chips and salsa right away. We ordered the Mexican Pizza with shrimp ($12) as well as the shredded beef enchiladas ($12 for three). I thought the pizza was definitely unique. I have no idea what it consisted of, but it was delicious. The crust was nice and flaky! The enchiladas were pretty mediocre. The servings were huge though.  Anyways, I was having a good experience until I tried to pay for the bill with a Groupon. I guess the Groupon could only be authorized by the manager, but he took 10-20 minutes to come around to the table. After that, it took lightyears to get a new bill. When I did get the new bill, servers kept walking past my table without picking up the check. This went on until I finally found cash in my bag and was able to leave."}
{"text":"Went on Cinco De Mayo .....waited about 5 minutes for a table. They went to seat us and found the table not cleaned so they asked us to go back and wait in the lobby. Finally seated, waited forever to get our drinks, as well as chips and salsa.  We had people who came in after us and seated, who ordered their food well after us get their food first.  We asked the waitress what was going on, she stated they could not get staff to work tonight, so they were short and trying to do their best.  We observed lots of people coming in and not being helped (they pulled their hostess to wait on tables) walk right back out after not being greeted at the door for over 30 minutes. It was very sad to see this happening in a restaurant that was highly recommended to us.  Did not enjoy our dinner at all."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! Every item is packed with flavor. The tequila sunrise enchiladas with shrimp and lobster are to die for and such a great deal!"}
{"text":"Different name but still a great place to eat!  Same owners and staff. New menu that is delicious!  You have to try the Mar y Tierra.  So good!  We were skeptical to go because we thought that it was going to be a different experience. Very relieved to see that LISA was still there. We had her as our waitress many times before.  She is Great and is very friendly!  We definitely will go back how that we know."}
{"text":"We went back to Jalisco Cantina and I am so glad we did.  Very busy night.  I had the fish tacos as I usually like to try at any Mexican place.  I am please to report that they are the best fish tacos I've had.  The breading was light, a perfect texture.  The Jicama slaw was what put these over the edge, good.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer, which was a bit chunky for my preference but the taste made up for any issue with texture on my part.  Fresh fresh fresh.  Such good flavor.  Service was stellar!  We will be back.  Regularly."}
{"text":"I've only been there two times and I already love this place! Great atmosphere and the food is really good. Reasonably priced too! They even have live music, which I really appreciate and hope they never change.   But the outstanding star of the show is the bartender Gretchen. She should be giving lessons to all other bartenders in Las Vegas on how the job should be done! Even though I'm not a \"regular\" she always called me by name, consistently made eye contact and checked in on me to make sure I had everything I needed. She was super friendly and made great recommendations on the food, She has a great sense of humor, and knows how to take care of her guests. She made the whole experience amazing!"}
{"text":"I am standing outside of jalisco  and no does open.  So I call it rings for 5 minutes for someone to tell me they are closed.  Horrible I came here for a friend's birthday and apparently they close when they want no matter what the signs read"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch - good value and Kelly the bartender does a nice job too!! They have delicious carnitas, and taqueria too!  Today I'm have the Casera chicken taco salad!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour in the bar has crazy good appetizers in huge portions at $3,$5 & $6.00!  Great tasting house margaritas for $2.50 but the best part is this restaurant offers green cilantro rice besides the standard red and you can request your pinto beans whole instead of refried.  Their house salsa has a great roasted tomato flavor too...so much more interesting than the usual around town.  We loved this place as Super-Mex before the name change and were delighted to see they kept the mainstays of the place the same.  It's all good!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. The service was good, friendly and fast. The chips and salsa was the best part of the meal. I ordered crispy tacos, they were soggy and the shredded beef had no flavor. While the service was good and the complimentary salsa and bean dip was tasty, I wouldn't go back here. I can go to Roberto's and get a much better taco for far less."}
{"text":"Fantasic food at very good prices. OMAR is the bomb bartender , but the rest of the bar crew is awesome. We enjoyed cilantro rice with tender whole beans served in a massive bowl of pork & spices, Authentic chili colorado just like in Chatsworth @ Los Toros. Large value menu is good 24/7 all under 5.95. Be coming back to this place, Lets just make it a Raider bar for NFL.  MUCHO GRACIAS..Rick y Wanda Henderson  EZ to find @ Sunset & Pecos. Bar has the best seating"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, recommend the Jalisco salad and Jalisco margarita at good prices."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would- this was absolutely terrible. I ordered the two combination plate with both chili rellenos... I found fish in my food... I ordered food with no meat in it for a reason. That was the first error. My friend ordered a shredded beef burrito and half of the beef was raw. Absolutely terrible...."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Everything is authentic, the chips & salsa so fresh so much flavor!!!  Tacos are my favorite but can't really make up my mind at times... can't express the amazing flavors of the food!!"}
{"text":"$7.95 for a house wine wine at Happy Hour, Margarita so weak, even adding an extra shot did not help. This place is off our Happy Hour List."}
{"text":"We were worried when the change happened, but honestly I like the food better.  The only thing we do miss is the green rice from Super Mex was much better and we like green chili verde, not red.  Besides that, we love the place, the food, the margaritas and their service is always great."}
{"text":"If you're a late night eater and don't know what you're craving for this is the place to go! I've seen this place when I go get gas at the chevron next to it, but never ate here. Around 1am me and my boyfriend were hungry so I came to find this place on yelp. What got me at first was their late night happy hour (11p-2am). $2 margaritas? Can't beat that.  So we got here around 1am and our server/bartender was Matt. Really friendly guy, easy talker, etc. customer service was on point. I order the taco Tijuana carne asada and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Food came out and portions were decent, but really sold us on was the taste of the food! Hands down best Mexican food we have tasted before (maybe even better than Lindo's).  Matt gave us some insight about the cook who is really passionate about what he does and even though it's after midnight, you expect food to be blah right? No not even like that. The chef knows what he's doing.  We will definitely be back for the drinks, food, and customer service."}
{"text":"We been there more than 20 times in the past years the only person the got all right is the bartender the white kinda heavy ...lol Sorry for my poor description. .  At night wellllll no goooood"}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a couple of times, late at night. Great late night happy hour from 11pm - 2am. The Tijuana street tacos...so much food for $5 happy hour price. And they are really good. Order the habanero salsa, I dare you! This has become my favorite late night, close to home hang. Awesome bartenders with great personalities."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Jalisco for a while, and when I saw a Groupon for it I decided to try it. We went last night at around 5:30.  It's a nice, cozy restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. The food was delicious (ceviche appetizer, shrimp fajitas for me and chicken enchilada for my husband), and was served quickly, and our waitress was really sweet and attentive.  I'd give it 5 starts if it wasn't for the hostess, though. She seemed annoyed that we came in. She didn't greet us, she didn't even say one word to us. When I came in she came out from the back of the restaurant where she was doing busy work, and looked at me without saying a word. I smiled and said \"hi, 2 please\". She grabbed the menus and started walking towards the tables. Again, no \"follow me please\" or \"this way\", nothing.  She stopped at what I assumed was our table, took away the extra silverware, put the menus down, and walked away. No \"enjoy your dinner\", \"here you go\", \"your server will be right with you\", not even a \"you're welcome\" when I said \"thank you\". She literally said nothing and her body language made me wonder if I'd done something to offend her. Maybe she was having a bad day, but we all have bad days and suck it up when dealing with the public.  So that kinda gave us a bad first impression. The food and our waitress made up for it, though.  We'll be back, but probably not for a while. Hopefully by then grumpy hostess will be gone."}
{"text":"Wow! Really GREAT food! Service was amazing! Food was fresh, delicious and the prices are on point! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food does not have any flavors.... The guacamole needs some spices and more avocado. I would not recommend this place, unless you are really hungry and don't really care"}
{"text":"We come here regularly not for the great service but for the reasonably priced food. I have gotten a few different things here. I've gotten chicken taquitos that were good. I also got the lettuce wraps one time but the shredded chicken was too greasy. My favorite is their carne asada burrito. They put an adobe sauce over it that I always say no to. I usually get a side of tomatillo sauce to put on top but be prepared it has a kick. The free chips and beans are always a nice way to start our meal as well."}
{"text":"This place gives big portions of food. Prices are very reasonable and they always have by one get one free coupons. The staff is very polite and attentive. If your looking to just have a drink at the bar, this bar is fully stocked and the bartenders are great! One of my favorite authentic mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"I found out today when my wife and I went by for dinner the location on Sunset has been closed. Tables and chairs stacked and ready to be moved. Sign on door indicating their closer. To bad as good Mexican in this valley is hard to find unless you want food made way to sweet. As with all casino Mexican restaurants no even good fast food. 5/18/2017"}
{"text":"Jalisco Cantina is not notably different than when the place was called SuperMex, but I enjoyed SuperMex, so that's a good thing.   The one minor peeve I had with SuperMex, was the serving of whole, round fried tortillas that you had to break up into pieces, instead of being able to enjoy pre- cut chips. This has been rectified.  My one peeve in the restaurant's current incarnation, is in the naming of a dessert, which is not truly Fried Ice Cream, but a big ball of ice cream concoction that falls short of greatness, only as a result of being covered in corn flakes that must turn nasty when frozen, because they taste stale. If they fixed this one issue, or even applied fresh cornflakes prior to serving, I would consider going over just for dessert.   Their salsa, burritos and fajitas are among my favorites of any Mexican restaurant's. I've sampled a variety of their dishes, and found consistently delicious entrees with savory, well-seasoned sauces.   On the sides they have a decent, but not thrilling, guacamole, and the standard, but competently prepared beans and rice. Instead of the usual, try the green rice sometime. It is something special.  Jalisco Cantina is good value for the money, offering quality food,  along with nice, frosty margaritas, a dimly lit, comfortable, and overall pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. The food is delicious. I would recommend the rice bowl and the shrimp Mexican pizza. Delicious. The service is hit or miss but the the food is consistently delicious. I can say I've never had a bad meal here especially for the price! Must try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the food was good specially the salsa, I had the tostada special and my husband the two taco lunch everything was delicious. The waitress was nice and friendly. $20 it's a good price for this meal."}
{"text":"The food is great! Really tasty and well priced! I was a little upset because the server seemed overwhelmed, stressed, and in a hurry. The server stuck out his tongue and said gross after I made my order. I think that is just plain rude. I hope that they can hire more people to help out because the service was pretty poor. I think this place has potential, but need some more training for the crew.   Not sure this is a place I would recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!! I make a home made Albondigas soup too and was pleasantly surprised theirs tasted very much like my own. It was really good and a large bowl, so I had to take some of it back to the hotel with me. My husband ordered their special which was a pork enchilada dish. He shared a few tastes with me and it was very very good. Salsa and beans to dip were great. No complaints here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited Friday, 8/19. We were on vacation from northern California and found this establishment through Groupon.   Jalisco Cantina has ruined Mexican food for the rest of my life as nothing will compare to how delicious it was. We had fajitas, enchiladas, taquitos, tamales, etc. I loved their yellow rice that was dripping with flavor. They served their enchilada with a burnt flavored red sauce that I always crave and can never find at any restaurants around here.  The service was quick. Our server was so polite and made multiple trips back to check on us.   My only complaint is that I couldn't pack this restaurant up and take it home with me."}
{"text":"Great place if you love Mexican food. I went in just before the restaurant part was close. The decor is cozy and welcoming. Our waitress was a very nice lady by the name of Marissa.  She was super friendly. I ordered a burrito and my girlfriend order the tostadas. The flavors blended well in my burrito. It was evenly seasoned and down right good.  For my girlfriend plate, she was overly pleased with the predation of it. I had a bite of her tostadas and it was good.  However, the taste of the pork in it was a little over powering for me. But still, it was good.  Highly recommend this place.  They're open 24/7 with the restaurant side closing at 11. They also have a live band that plays Tuesday's and Saturdays. 2 up for this place."}
{"text":"We were trying to go somewhere quite close to home. Honestly can't get closer than this. We were greeted right away by our server Martin. My husband had many questions about the special. It was shrimp tacos with jicama slaw. He did not know what jicama was. Martin took his time in explaining what it is.  We started with the chips, salsa and beans. Very good way to begin. We ordered the fresh guacamole. Also quite delicious. My DH had the special, I went for the albondigas soup and a salad. The soup came in a huge bowl. Honestly enough for two people. The flavor was subtle and perfect. The meatballs plenty  and delicious. The salad was fresh with cucumbers ,romaine, tomatoes and queso fresco cheese. I took half of both home.  My DH ate every bit of the special. Loved the jicama slaw.  The portions are generous, the service outstanding. Priced right for the amount of food. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Food = great. Great selection of classic favorites, beans and salsa while you wait, fast service.   Our waitress was helpful in suggesting her favorite dishes, patient and it was a great experience overall. Lots of room for big parties, or intimate booths for small parties.  Booths are a little squeeze and the only thing I truly don't like is that in the bar, you can smoke. I will say it doesn't travel much and take over the restaurant, but I just prefer to be farther away from it."}
{"text":"What a great Mexican restaurant. So glad we found it! We tried all kind of goodies. Traditional food such as cheese quesadilla, ground beef taco, enchiladas, and bean and cheese burrito. It all was super tasty, and so were the chips and salsa and refried beans. And the Sopapillas! Yumm, they were delicious! We will definitely go back! And Maria, our server, she was super friendly! Bravo!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Jalisco Cantina in Las Vegas, NV on 11/23/2014.  It was my 1st time there.  There was about a dozen of us.  I had a three item combo and a large tamarindo (no free refills).  The food was good and Juan, our server, did a fine job.  Plus, I took photos."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The bartenders are amazing and they remember us and what we drink. Gretchen and Matt are our favorite bartenders. We will always come back as long as they are there. Oh and the margaritas...well it's a tequila bar so obviously they are amazing! We enjoy that they stay open late and serve good food. We preferred the old menu but they changed the name so they changed some of the food as well. They also have live music on the weekends and a jukebox if you want to pay for music you love. Overall I would prefer going to this bar late at night and enjoying some yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"I sat for 45 mins.  Not once anyone asked me if I was hungry or thirsty.  But it appears that there was a staff meeting and nobody seemed too happy. I couldn't wait any longer I had to go to work.   Since driving by the other day, I see it is closed down.  What a bad business!!!"}
{"text":"had a shredded beef burrito that was on the lunch special menu and for the price theyre wasnt much special bout it but it was a decent feeling meal"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant! Where do I start?! The bean dip & salsa was an awesome start. Mix em' up! I ordered the shredded beef enchiladas & a crispy taco. The only bad thing was that I got full way too soon!  Rosa was an awesome server, always topping off my iced tea! Also, even the iced tea was awesome! We were visiting from No Cali and found this gem on Groupon! If I was a local, I would be there at least 2-3 times a week!"}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed this place, even when it used to be the ol' Super-Mex. You will not find traditional Mexican cuisine here. But it is not a Qdoba or Baja Fresh either. It's somewhere in the middle, very similar to a Lindo. Plus, I've never had a bad meal here.  I wanted to check out Jalisco's ever since they bought out the Super Mex. When the Groupon came out, it provided me with just that opportunity. I can assure everyone that the food is pretty much the same quality, which is a good thing.  Let's start out with the complimentary tortilla chips. They are a wonderful balance of crispness and greasiness. The salsa is on point, with a slight kick, and fresh flavors.  I thought that the shredded meats, beef and chicken, were a little bit on the tougher side, but not by much, I still enjoyed them in their taquito, enchilada, or taco form. The sauces had well balanced flavors, and everything was well seasoned! Everything tasted very fresh as well! The guy did mess up my order a lil bit by forgetting my tortillas that were supposed to come with my queso fondito... I was about to go into Hulk smash mode, but realized that sometimes things happen, maybe not the way I expect, but in a way that makes me want to eat my hot cheese with a fork.  Juan's flaming will be my go-to spot for tex-mex cuisine. But, Jalisco's isn't too far behind, and I like the fact that this place is centrally located. A packed dining room on a Wednesday night can't be wrong as well!! They also have some killer happy hour and graveyard specials."}
{"text":"Breakfast quesadilla is amazing. No wait. Sat down and was eating a great Mexican breakfast in minutes."}
{"text":"Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \"yeah I know it's bad.\"  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Will not be back! I love Mexican food and I've had my share believe me both restaurant and home cooked. This place is a disappointment. Other than the beans served while waiting on your food this food is not up to par by no means. To me a waste of money! Could've went to taco y taco and been satisfied.  Update: I see they have changed the name of this place yet again! I've been living in the valley for 8 years now and this place has had like 5 names! Hopefully the food taste better."}
{"text":"First time trying Mexican up in Nevada and I was definitely satisfied! I love that they offer salsa AND bean dip complimentary when you're waiting for your order!  I ordered the Tamale & my partner ordered a taco salad!  Tamale - Super moist, cheesy, but a bit bland. Green sauce that went with it was okay. Rice & beans were so good! I got the mole sauce with it too, which I was in love with! It was on the sweeter side (:  Taco Salad - Had shredded chicken that was marinated in this awesome sauce!   Both dishes were HUGE and we couldn't finish it! Super filling for a steal!   It's located off the strip, but well worth the short drive (: When I visit Vegas again, I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Wasent sure what I was getting into trying this new place but I must say I'm glad I stopped by and tried the taste of greatness there good was great and the horchata delicious and my carne asada burrito I had was just what my hunger was looking for I recommend stopping by! Tip try the horchata  and carne asada your won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and pleased. The chips and salsa and bean dip were great. I mentioned to our server that I like spicy stuff she went to the kitchen and came back out with some of their spicy salsa. It was very spicy and fresh. It was cool of her to do that and said it can be requested on future visits.   I ordered the carne asada casero burrito but asked them to leave off the bbq sauce and add tomatillo instead. I also asked to have just meat, cheese and sour cream inside my burrito and no rice on my plate. When my burrito came it looked so good but when I cut it open there was rice and beans along with the meat, cheese and sour cream. I was disappointed because I said that I did not want any rice and was specific about what I wanted in my burrito. I could have said something but didn't want to wait for it to be remade and just ate around the rice. The tomatillo sauce was very good and so was the burrito aside from the goof. When our server came to check on us she noticed the pile of rice on my plate and was upset my burrito did not come out right. She offered twice to have it remade but I explained that it was fine, and that she even noticed meant something. My wife loved her meal and had no complaints. Service was great and we were checked on often. This is a legit place to eat and I will back."}
{"text":"They're pretty fast on seating you and bringing out your food. The chicken tacos are legitimately my favorite chicken tacos I've ever had. They give you complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip. I recommend it to anybody!"}
{"text":"I've dined in, but usually pick up to go.  They have my favorite chile relleno in town. They're big, cheesy, eggy (not too thick), and I think they've got some chicken in them, or something, but it's just tasty.  The wet burritos are good, my bff loves the al pastor tacos, ordering over the phone can be weird every once in a while, but we figure it out.  Just eat everything."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with no ambiance at all.  I decided on this place because I ran into a groupon and I still haven't learned my lesson  that sometimes there's a good reason to skip on a groupon deal because the food isn't great. The food here was ok. No bold flavors and it's not a spot I would likely visit again.   Mexican places should always have some authentic decor and the ambiance is key for me because the experience begin with your eyes. There's nothing of that nature here and the food pretty much went along with everything else. I ordered a hard chicken taco & a cheese enchilada which lacked in flavor and my mans mega burrito was a mega disappointment as well. Lots of food for sure but not traditional in any way.   The service was good so thank you for that but it needs some traditional decorations and a chef who knows about Mexican flavors. There are so many great spots in town and this one isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Two stars because food was decent. Carne asada was really tender. One additional star because the bartender immediately greeted us and was nice.   However.... The seats within the bar are really uncomfortable. We sat at a little table and I could not get comfy. Maybe I'm weird, but I didn't like it. Next, I went to the ladies room and the entire door was missing to the entrance. Why?! What happened? I stood their confused. Men's room had a bathroom door, why couldn't the ladies?   I would eat here again. Oh! It also was weird that the bartender was walking around smoking a cigarette. I didn't care about that really, just didn't seem professional.   Food is good though! Seriously, eat here."}
{"text":"Always great service and food. I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I had come here after a night of heavy drinking. We used to come here all the time when it was SuperMex. I guess the chef also changed along with the name change, because the food was pretty bad that night. When we first arrived, we sat in the section right next to the bar. It took us 10-15 minutes to get our waters when there was no one else in the restaurant. The ten minutes seemed like FOREVER since we were all pretty slizzard. When we ordered our food, the waitress seemed alright. My boyfriend wanted to get guacamole instead of refried beans. The waitress kept saying that it wasn't possible and they can't do that. So my boyfriend tried telling her he'll pay extra if you can just give us the guacamole on the side instead of the beans, but she still said no. But wait...when we wanted an extra side of guac later after we had gotten our food, it was ok? ok. whatever. After ordering, it literally took 40-45 minutes to get our food. There was no one else in the restaurant, just us, and it took so stinkin long. When we finally did get our food, anyone who had ordered carne asada style ended up with really tough burnt meat. The food and service was all around bad. This really saddened my good friend because hes been coming here since forever and now we have to find somewhere else to go :("}
{"text":"Went in for cinco de mayo. Omar was working, with another new bartender, and the service was amazing.  I was a little bummed they didn't have their normal happy hour menu but ordered chicken enchiladas and they were delicious. I'm so glad that they not longer employ people who hate their jobs. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is awesome. Nachos with carnitas and the mushroom quesadilla are both amazing. the bacon wrapped shrimp is SO good. I just had the chicken and bacon burrito and it is incredible. The dishes are mild but they have sauces on the table to spice things up if you care to. I like everything they serve as is."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this restaurant I was eager to try it out with some co-workers. Upon arrival we were greeted and seated, drink orders were taken, ok now time to look at the menu. In my honest opinion they are a bit pricey for what they serve. I ordered the lunch special tacos and they had to have been theeeeeee greasiest tacos I have ever eaten. My colleague ordered another taco dish and had to send his back as it was swimming in grease. It took forever to flag down the waiter to send the dish back.  On a positive note they ended up bringing us two of the same replacement plates, so that tells me they are on it when it comes to dishes sent back. I will not return based off of the food. Service was decent though. Nice people."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is never busy. They have pretty decent food. And it's quick. Their Salsa is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is really clean  we always order the carne asade plate and end up taking half of it home  they have a value meal with lots of choices for 5,88  open 24 hours, its a nice clean place."}
{"text":"Updated review: After my last review, I had honestly resigned to needing to find a different Mexican establishment. I was asked to give them another shot. So, we did. We went there last night (3/6) after 8pm. My husband was seated and ordered drinks while I finished up a phone call. When I finished, our orders were taken quickly and the staff was pleasant.    We were busy snacking on the chips and salsa and playing on our phones, when we were approached by our server asking if we'd like dessert.   I was a little confused. Generally, I like to receive dinner before checking out the dessert menu. When informed we had yet to receive our meals, we were informed they would be right out. And they were. Almost as though they had been done for fora while and we're waiting to be delivered. Hmmm.   To make matters worse, the chicken my husband had ordered had somehow disguised itself as shredded beef. We had to wait for our server to check on us again and we got it corrected. So, I waited for him to finish as I was already done with my meal at that time.  Sorry, but I don't do 3rd strikes. We're not playing baseball here.  I would recommend finding an establishment without so many \"kinks\" to apparently work out.   Original review: (4 months ago) I would be willing to eat here now and then, but realistically, it's not very high on my list of places.   The biggest change to this place is the name on the building. It is still Super Mex in all other ways. The menu is extremely similar, the food is similar in cost and flavor. I did not find a whole lot of differences.   I agree with my husband, Chris R., that the salsa has improved and the chips seem easier as actual chips vs the rounds. I didn't mind the old style and have no preference.   The food was decent. Nothing spectacular. My food was HOT, as in, I had to let the tortillas cool for a bit each time - but that isn't a negative.   I guess I just didn't see much difference, but I also didn't mind Super Mex, so it's probably about the same now. Near the end of the Super Mex name, we stopped going there. We didn't have a great last experience and it takes us a while to give second chances, especially when stomach issues are involved (I have a sensitive stomach, not that there was anything MAJOR with the food).   Like I said, aside from the signage on the building, everything is basically the same. Even my receipt still says Super Mex on it."}
{"text":"If they would bring the Chile Colorado back I'd give them 5 stars. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Received really bad service. Had to ask like 4 times for a water refill. Couldn't get the waitress to bring us anything without reminding her. I think we were a \"floater\" table, meaning we didn't have a dedicated server, but were served by whoever wasn't busy at the time. We spent a lot of money last night and probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Two words, Happy Hour!  Margaritas for $2.50, beers for $2.00, and some pretty tasty cheap food. I ended up ordering the Tacos Tijuana w/carne asada which only costs $5, it came with two tacos and rice and beans. The tacos were delicious, they came w/chorizo, steak, and cheese. I also ordered the camaron tropical guacamole (also $5), it was also delicious and definitely different, it's not your average guacamole. The guacamole was mixed with mango and shrimp, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The bartender was really nice, he showed great customer service. I can't wait to return to HH again, Friday nights it starts at 11 p.m. and ends at 2 a.m."}
{"text":"Very good for being reasonably priced. Its not high end Mexican cuisine but their service is great and they have a broad enough menu. I enjoyed the chicharrones, or fried pork rinds. How often do you find those on a menu? All large portions too.   We never had to ask for refills or anything either. Waitresses were working as a team."}
{"text":"So not impressed. I think they gave us salad dressing instead of salsa. Everything was very bland (including the hot sauce). Service ok (glasses sat empty for a while)."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a coworker. Loved the carne asada and the people were extremely attentive and friendly! They kept the drinks coming and the food was great! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"One word -OUTSTANDING! My husband and I were in Las Vegas celebrating his birthday and we were craving some Mexican food. We ended up here! What a wonderful place to end up! Matt (Bartender) has excellent customer service. The food was SUPERB!"}
{"text":"I thought I found a neighborhood restaurant that I would enjoy. Unfortunately the second time I went to this restaurant the food was horrible. I don't know if they changed the cook the chef or what but I will not be returning. Nachos with pink ground beef I don't think so."}
{"text":"The most delicious chile verde ever!!! Great chips and salsa. I have celiac and they were very accommodating with their menu. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Ok because I had a groupon. Otherwise the chips were stale and the food just wasn't that good. My food and my husbands were both wrong when they came out."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and each time it is excellent! I normally don't like this kind of food so I was pleasantly surprised. Their flan is to die for and their pork is the most tender I've ever had. If they made pork bbq sandwiches though I would be in heaven."}
{"text":"So meet up for dinner with friends that are regulars. Jalisco Cantina is place that passed by on rare occasions happen to be on the other side of town. I keep thinking it more bar then restaurant. I was pleasantly surprise with my whole experience not that heard bad things. My friends that are regulars was on point talking about solid food. The inside really like one section that dining and another section that cantina or bar area. We sat at the bar area. It great spot if want watch sports think two or three wide screens above the bar area. They have special HH menu and drinks.   The food I went with the Chile Verde Burrito. Talk about huge burrito. It was more burrito then plate. No joke. The size was eye opener but truthfully the Chili Verde inside was one of the best one had to date. It just had great depth of flavor, hearty, the pork was cooked perfect, and the cheese melted on top along with side of guacamole and more. It might look messy but dam good!!! The house chips and salsa was tasty as well.   The service was five star! It did help first timer going with regulars. Our waitress was very attentive, explained the menu to the first timers, and was on it the whole night.   The prices are very reasonable. If am in the area and got urge for Mexican food not doubt would stop by Jalisco Cantina."}
{"text":"Sorry to see that this place is closed, since it was my favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday so I don't know what took me so long to try it. I went in around 11:30 on a Saturday morning, perfect time since it wasn't that busy. Greeted and seated promptly. Nice menu with a lot of options. Salsa was amazing, chips were oily and stale. This wasn't looking good so far. I decided to have a 2 item combo with rice and beans, Waitress came over to take my order, told her want I wanted and she proceeded to repeat my order that was totally wrong. Why don't they write it down anymore? I don't care about your memory skills, just get my order right! After finally getting my order I could only wait until the food arrived.  The food was awesome! Cheese enchilada had a lot of cheese and the red sauce didn't have the metallic taste a lot do. Carne Asada crispy taco had a lot of flavor. It was topped with onions, cilantro, and an avocado/tomato relish that I took off. (I don't like avocados). I poured some of the salsa on top and it was delicious. Loved the beans and the rice. I cant wait until my parents come to town so I can take them here. Overall it was a nice experience and the price was good."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  The best salsa I have ever had!   Food is wonderful!!  I have been coming here since it was Super Mex.  LOVE THIS PLACE!  I bring all my friends here."}
{"text":"Called in an order for take out last night, got there in the time quoted 20 minutes. Approached counter and got ingored for about 5 minutes, finally got \"I will be right with you\".  Finally what seemed to be the manager, told me my order will be ready shortly (didnt bother to ask my name or what my order was) gave me a total to pay which I took the receipt from him to verify my own order. I sat down and waited another 15 minutes. During this time I witnessed a party of 6 walk out, I'm guessing because food took to long because I could see the waitress talking with the cooks (cooks looked clueless and showed no sense of urgency, actually looked mad because guest left), I then observed a server having issues with tendering a check, I over heard the guess pointing out wrong items on a split check. The employees looked as if they had no sense of direction, running in circles but not really accomplishing anything. The manager (scratched his balls and got a pat on the ass by a waitress) did not seem worried about the lose of revenue by a party of 6 walking out. Finally I see my order, the waitress bags it up, then lets it sit there for a minute while she answers the phone. I finally get my order, the waitress was very sweet and aplogetic and seemed sincere. I get home and my order is COMPLETELY opposite of what I ordered!!!!!!!!! I call the manager and inform him of the situation. 1. I wasnt going to drive back for my correct order, 2. I just wanted him to better manage his outlet and lead his team. Manager did not seem to give to shits about my frustrations. Its said because I like their food but the service has gone so badly since becoming Jalisco Cantina. Supermex service was a little slow but at least I got what I ordered. This place is going down hill and fast."}
{"text":"Best food and service we had after a week in Vegas! Awesome authentic and refreshing food at a low price. We will definitely be back next time we're in town. Great local flavor and change from the strip."}
{"text":"There is no more Chicken Taco Salad lunch special.  I used to order that 2-3 times per week. I'm upset that my favorite lunch restaurant has changed :(.  I was informed it was the same owners but the food and service are not where near as good as they used to be."}
{"text":"Chicken Nachos good! Chicken and bacon burrito(enough said it's got bacon in it) Definitely worth the stop. Great service and food."}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 2.5 stars but that is not an option.  I figure that a 3 out of 5 is a place I would return to, and unfortunately, this will not make the cut.  I wanted it to be good, as it is very near where I will be moving to, and I wanted a nice close-in Mexican restaurant.  Will try and be brief:  1.  Hostess friendly, seated promptly (Sunday around 7:00 PM) 2.  Waiter quickly brought chips, salsa, and beans to table.  This was a positive, as that is my expectation at Mex restaurants.  Salsa was good, beans were lukewarm and very firm like they had been sitting drying out for a while.  Chips were just \"ok\" at best.  Couldn't quite tell if they had been fried up there that day or not.  I want HOT chips that have just been salted and evidence they had just come out of a fryer less than 10-15 min prior. 3.  Food, kinda bland.  I got a combo plate, chicken \"crispy\" taco (soggy by the time it got to me as it laying on wet lettuce), an average cheese enchilada, and average rice and beans. 4.  The \"cadillac\" margarita definitely had tequila in it, which I was impressed by, but I thought it was a fairly small glass and not real flavorful with real lime juice, etc.  So . . . will I return?  Very doubtful.  Lindo Michoachan pretty much sets the standard for food/service/presentation in Vegas, and JC gets a 4 on a 10 LM scale.  Again, regrettable as I wanted this to be a go to place for local Mex.  Revision 1/6/2015 The owners have reached out to me by my comments and are very concerned I did not have a first rate experience.  I am encouraged by that and they urge us to give them another try (which I will do).  That is quite positive right there, that they are monitoring Yelp and respond to reviewers.  Also, I didn't mention that we ordered some guacamole dip and it was VERY good and VERY fresh (I think they mixed it up just as we ordered it!"}
{"text":"Well I tried Jalisco again because I had the Groupon. Not happy that they charged me an extra $2.75 to add a bit of rice to my Chicken Taco Salad AND this is after messing up my order when I said I didn't want it in a tortilla shell. Really?!?  The food has gotten a little better but I still miss my old Super Mex.. :("}
{"text":"Had the chicken fajitas and were excellent with side of pinto beans and the ice tea was very fresh overall rank it awesome dining experience, Lisa was an amazing server!"}
{"text":"I call this place and ask if they have pupusas and the girl, gretchen was her name I believe If I heard correctly hangs up on me! I call back and she doesn't pick up! I call private and ask why she hung up on me and she hangs up on me again! Super rude place! I'll be contacting the manager in the morning about this!  After speaking to management and reading the business's response I can understand what happened.. Im still not the happiest camper about an employee hanging up on me instead of trying to clearly understand what I'm saying, but the situation is comical at the least...   Poo Poo sauce.. Lol   That's what I get for calling a Mexican restaurant looking for pupsas.. Haha"}
{"text":"They got my order wrong but the service and food were still good. Some of the best Mexican food ive had in a while. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is awesome  the food is really great and authentic  the service is fast and they are very nice. The food is well cooked and comes out steaming  hot!  I love their chips and dip, especially the smashed beans for the chips. My favorite meal is the enchilada with rice and smashed beans . They also have a good Bloody Mary Great job! Oh yea, one more thing... their prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"I have a family with three young kids. We have lived in this area for two years and have passed by this place many times.  Always turned off from going in because we thought is was a gaming lounge since they have this really large 24 hour gaming sign... Plus no windows, etc but a nice looking building.  We walked in the doors and the place is very, very nice and clean.  Now gaming/bar setting in the dinning area.  To the food.  It was great!!!! Chips, salsa, guacamole all very good and fresh.  Kids loved their food.  I had a steak burrito which was very good.  Service was also very nice and attentive.  This will be our new spot for when we want sit down Mexican."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best Mexican food in Las Vegas if you're looking to have a good time with exceptional service and epic food this is the place you must visit. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and by all means it exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"This place sucks as did Super Mex come to find out it's the same owner. They think that adding spice or making the plate hot in taste makes it a good Mexican restaurant. The chicken was hard and dry and serving queso fundido with \"tostito\" chips is a No No tortillas is the way to go. The bottom line is this is a gringo restaurant.  I will not be back and I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars 2 years ago when it was Super Mex ( always thought that was a dumb name) . I'm pleased to say now that it is Jalisco Cantina (better name) the food is just as good if not better. Fantastic salsa, delicious yellow rice and wonderful flavors throughout the menu. Also love the new festive paint colors they chose for the interior, one of our favorite places for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise... Great salsa, fresh chips & refried bean dip. Appetizer we shared was a plate full of roasted onions & jalapeños, for under $3. Had value, pick 2, chile relleno & chicken taquitos. Had frozen daiquiris - peach & strawberry, both were tasty.  Food solid 4* Service 4* Ambiance 3*  I look at some of the Yelpers giving one star & it's their first or second review...I'm not sure what restaurant they were at, but it wasn't here. Or perhaps they are competitors or recently fired employees & family. Just sayin.... I never consider a reviewer that says weird things like : I wouldn't feed this to my dog or I wanted to throw up. If the review is drastically different than the majority & hostile, from a brand new Yelper...ummmm. Anyway, off my soapbox. I find that type of BS annoying.   Try Jalisco, good food, drinks & service. I recommend."}
{"text":"I love the customer service here! The day time bar tender is awesome! Not only is she super beautiful, she is very personable and happy.  The food here is good, but the customer service makes this place amazing! I definitely suggest anyone should come here. The Mexican food is huge and great!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"OUT of Business Really a shame as they had very good food.y husband loved their street tacos. I loved their crispy tavos."}
{"text":"Excellant place.  I have lived in Vegas for 10 years and after living in California I thought I would never find a great Mexican place here.  This place is definitely the ticket."}
{"text":"I arrive and ask for a booth, I do realize I'm a party of one in a near empty place ( before lunch rush) and was acomodated. I explain beforehand I have a Groupon. I was told what the specials of the day were and I agreed. So far so good, right? WRONG!. The seat in the booth tilted, it's broken, I nearly fell....I asked server to pick a drink for me....she did ...but why do you serve top shelf margaritas in a bud light promo glass??  Food, well if it wasn't served with salsa and tortillas, it could pass for a diff. cuisine...it was yummy. Server 5 stars, she did her job ( thanks lisa). Management 1 star just  for hiring her!.. (otherwise,  should not have hazards in restaurant) Bartender, the drink was awesome...again management...pick new glassware!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was okay. It was a beautiful night so we choose to sit outside, away from the smoke of the bar. It was nice but not really taken care of. They have the potential of making it very nice patio seating. The best thing was it was Tuesday night which apparently meant live music. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. The beans with chips and salsa is a very nice addition! I love their 2 item combos...enough food for 2! This is my third time here and each time it has been a great experience."}
{"text":"I just love this place...they are very accommodating...my cousin is a vegetarian & asked if flautas could be made with beans...no problem! Great nachos & fresh guacamole & of course serious margaritas! If Rosa is there ask for her...great waitress!!!"}
{"text":"On Tuesdays they have live music featuring local talented blues musicians. The live music starts at 8 pm and runs until 11 pm. Excellent entertainment! The food is authentic Mexican food and I am grateful that this restaurant offers both great food and great music."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican at best. Food is as uninspired as its strip mall surroundings. And with lunch costing $15 for a drink and two a la cart items, way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go to Roberto's instead. Same quality food for half the price."}
{"text":"The food is good, especially at the bar after hours because it is made fresh. The bartender is nice, a man named Carlos. He was quick and pleasant with my order of drinks. But when I come during the day, there was no one to greet us, and there was only a sign to tell us to seat ourselves. Once we sat down, the waitress gave us miss-matched silverware and cups of water that had small fingerprint-looking stains on it. But once we got the food, it was mediocre, and mole had no flavor, any chicken we had was drenched in some sauce. But the enchiladas were hot and good, and the fried chicken was fresh, but lack of seasoning on the mole and rice could be tasted. I would suggest this place if you are also drinking or seeing the live band, but not during the day after lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots. The happy hour value menu is a great deal and usually you can always get table without a wait. Great value and food."}
{"text":"Super good food, service, and cold beer. It was a nice surprise. The albondigas soup was perfect! The beans tasted homemade and cooked with lard, which makes a big difference. So yummy! The quesadilla was wonderful, made with mushrooms. I loved the bean dip that came with the chips. Our server Rosa was as sweet as can be and never forgot about us, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Chips were stale tasting, the salsa tastes like water and the beans had zero flavor.  After the bland chips n dip I decided to just order a chicken taco which was actually pretty tasty. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Most of the stuff that I've tried on their menu is ok. Nothing special, but not bad.  Their salsa is quite possibly the best thing that was ever done to a tomato."}
{"text":"Bad food, horrible service, and a TERRIBLE manager!  Nickle and dime you to death...used to LOVE coming here, but never again. And when we tried to speak with the Manager about it he laughed and walked away...  Stay Classy Jalisco.  Stay Classy."}
{"text":"No comparison to Roberto's please this is a nice place and staff is very friendly I think even more now with the name change.  If you want food at any time of the day or night this is the place for you.  Excellent prompt service I have been here several times and   haven't been dissapointed yet."}
{"text":"Like the fact it is open 24 hours.  My wife and went there over Labor Day weekend and had the shrimp app and a steak burrito. Everything was perfect, had enough burrito to share and take back to hotel.  Had no problem using the groupon.  Our server gave us some utensils to take back also.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love this place, let me tell you why.   Reasonably priced. Unpretentious. Clean--though it doubles as a gaming bar.  Great drinks -- La Patrona.  Great drinks -- being redundant -- tequila selection.  Open 24/7*.  Great food and great consistency*.  -nothing pisses me off more than having a great meal; then returning and getting a sub-par meal.  Live bands-call ahead in case you want music/quietness.  Great locale.  Never messed up an order.  Fast and efficient=great staff.   Things my hubby and I recommend there: Enchiladas-any kind Guacamole Mango shrimp guacamole Ground beef-tacos or whatever Chips, salsa, bean dip Tomato soup Chimichangas  *They do close for MAJOR holidays *They do not serve all entrees after 11pm (ex. no ground beef entrees)"}
{"text":"Once again groupon helped out in trying a new spot. The bar and restaurant area are very cool. You can tell they really tried to get that authentic look. The drink prices are pretty steep. Especially for the margarita which consisted of sour and tequila with some line juice squeezed in. The bartender Imelda was very nice. Now the reason for the four stars was the food. I am kicking myself in the butt for not ordering the street tacos which I believe is what they are known for. I opted for the Jalisco carnitas plate which wasn't so good. I was hungry so I took it down. I'll try it again soon and get the street tacos next time."}
{"text":"Ok first off I go in there and order food to go. I ordered 2 bowls of tortilla soup and one taco combo plate with one additional taco, got charged $ 32.00 That's crazy. Second I get the food home only live a couple minutes away the tacos are soggy and ice cold, the soup is ice cold too. I was wondering where the chicken was in the tortilla soup since I just received 2 bowls of broth. No toppings like cheese and avocado or tortilla. There was some tortilla in the soup soggy as hell too. I would recommend that you steer clear of this place the food was disgusting and I would not feed it to my dog. I basically just threw away $ 32.00. Also from what a patron their told me as he was disappointed too because he blew $ 80.00 in 5 minutes on 5 different machines and could not even hit anything better than a pair. I think this place is owned by crooks who cheat people anyway they can food, machines, whatever.  AWEFUL EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"I think the daily special - carne asada like- dinner was ok nothing special about it.  The price is right for the food however the drinks were kinda pricey.  A regular margarita tasted nothing like at Lindo M...that was waste of $ however the tall margarita was much better :) A bottle of beer is almost $5 kinda high for this place. The server was friendly and very helpful overall I enjoyed the meal I chose but not the margarita or the price of our bill"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic.  We had Marissa as a waitress. She kept our glasses full and was beyond pleasant and patient.  . The food was absolutely fantastic.  I hate chicken but theirs was so juicy and tender i fell in love.  All together there was 4 people in my party and everyone left happy.   The only thing i found weird was they played blues on a Tuesday night. And water was dripping from the ac unit.  But they deserve 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So SuperMex changed into Jaliscos. Some things are the same, some are totally different.   Same: décor, atmosphere, 24 hours, bar, etc.   Different: menu, you can now order multiple styles of Mexican pizza, the ceviche has lobster, there is a HUGE bowl of very good albondigas, the salsa is spicier, overall, BETTER.  Still just average cuisine, and everyone stomach hurt a bit after. The cheese enchiladas were average. We did not care for the shredded beef. The ceviche was also just ok, it needed more cucumber. The soup and the nachos were the best, which is not saying much for a Mexican place.   I wish Henderson would step their game up for authentic Mexican food. I know this is a short review but really, there isn't much to say about this place. It is decent, but that's all. Nothing stands out from food to service. I wouldn't doubt another name change is soon to come."}
{"text":"A recent transplant to Las Vegas -  I have found my \"Mexican food home\" with Jalisco. The Street Tacos are some of the best I have ever had and the Carne Asada is always consistent. My wife loves the cheese enchiladas. Another real nice touch is the refried beans served alongside chips and salsa. Try not to fill up on them as I always do, and always find myself taking leftovers home, which are almost as good as the original a day later. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great  place to take the kids I love that I can feed my Family of 5 for  40 bucks can't beat that and the staff is so nice"}
{"text":"Wow! If you are any kind of foodie you will love this place. Everything down to the refried beans was incredible. One of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at. Well done."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting! Our waitress was super attentive. In fact, one of our orders came out a little mixed up (no biggie) they felt so bad they bought us a round of margaritas!!  We had the fresh guacamole and it did not disappoint! It was chunky with cilantro and onion. I loved it!  I had a cheese enchilada , chicken taquitos , carne asada. All were AMAZING.  Margaritas not very powerful, but still enjoyable.  I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"The voucher I bought on groupon did not match the restaurant offer. Please don't advertise false information if you can't give the deal. The food was terrible I gave it to my dogs and heads up the AC is out this place is old and run  down no AC in 100 degree weather wtf ! Hmm gee im glad I didn't get the shrimp cocktail Buyer beware the waitress never understood anything I asked about why they did not honor the voucher This place is a straight dump. The food was terrible."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Tuesday nights they have a live band and the main bartender OMAR is one of the best!  Coming here is a weekly ritual"}
{"text":"Oh my god!! My new \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. Their enchiladas were amazing. I've recently had this obsession with enchiladas and their chicken/shredded beef ones were great. My father and I went here with a groupon and even without it... It would've been so cheap! Make sure to check out their \"special\" menus for to do for deals!! Salsa at a Mexican restaurant is a huge factor for me and their (chips and) salsa were so good! Will definitely return. Our male waiter was very friendly and efficient! Great place! Pics to follow."}
{"text":"Food is good but only during regular hours. shure during happy hour margaritas are good price but food menu changes and selection is not good. Only coming for dinner."}
{"text":"no matter the food it bugs me when four of the servers stand with their backs to the tables, in a corner, yaking,  while I try to get someones attention to get a water refill"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after work for a couple strong margaritas and an appetizer. Feels just like the Super-Mex that was there a couple months ago. Drinks were good, appetizer was good, and the bartender was very friendly."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Service with a smile and good music. The tall cook was very pleasing to the eyes and the bus person was to. Will more than likely be back."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere was great, overall...great! Server was friendly and attentive, and prices are very good !"}
{"text":"Didnt know that there's a great Mexican place just a few blocks away from our house. Found a groupon and checked reviews on yelp. Decided to check this place out. We ordered the guacamole - not the usual but in chunks. It was good. we got the green chili rellenos and carne asada burrito. Servings r huge! Will go back again"}
{"text":"I have always gotten really good food here. I have been there two or three times. They tend to have large servings. Their chips and salsa is very good. I tend to gauge restaurants by their chips and salsa so this one is a plus. also a nice atmosphere if you want to bring several people in just to chit chat and have dinner together. They also have a bar if you like the bar room type atmosphere. One time that I visited I said at the bar and drink a cocktail and they gave me free chips and salsa and I thought that was cool."}
{"text":"Unfortunate name change for them. Las Vegas, the land of biscuits and gravy dirt bikers, will have a hard time pronouncing Jalisco Cantina.   I had a combo plate. 2 enchilada's and 1 chile relleno with Mole. I asked 3 times for the extra spicy salsa, the first 2 times they brought the red salsa that tasted more like ketchup. The food was good, just not great but for the money, I'll take it.   They no longer serve tostada shells in their \"chips n salsa\", now they actually bring you chips! Kinda sucks, I had fun breaking up the tostada shells."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. Service was terrible, food was bland and pricey for Mexican food. I wouldn't go back rather go to Wahoo's"}
{"text":"Delicious Very quick service, don't plan on a lot of conversations time over your appetizer... Guacamole arrived, had just dipped a chip and here are our entrees.  Carnitas were very very good. Only wish they had some big fluffy homemade tortillas to go with them. But other than that.  Their guacamole  classic was awesome as well, not the mashed up version we're used to, but great big chunks of avocado seasoned very well. Recommend this place, give it a try."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, especially for Mexican. The pork carnitas are always good. Lots of different things to pick from on the menu."}
{"text":"Family owned now. Formerly a partnership when the restaurant was Super Mex. Good food then, better food now. My favorite is the Tlaquepaque fajitas - a house specialty. The best margaritas come in tall Dos Equis glasses. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch and what a pleasant surprise! Honestly, the BEST carnitas I have ever had! So juicy and soft, not crunchy or over-cooked. We also enjoyed the queso fundido, the molletos and a bowl from the value menu. It's been a long time since I've had good Mexican food and this is very deserving of all 5 stars and then some! Accommodating and attentive wait staff, timely service, clean restaurant, will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"Brutal service!!!  The ladies here do not want to be here.  Food was decent.  The only positive was a huge cold beer that they brought to the table.  This experience is not worthy of a review."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place because it had great reviews. However, we were really unimpressed. First of all the waitresses argued over which one was actually going to wait on us, after we had already been waiting for quiet sometime. The waitress barely understood basic English. My husband ordered no beans with his meal and I got no beans with mine which I wanted. My husband said his chicken enchiladas tasted like chicken from a can. I wasn't impressed with my meal as well. We ordered fried ice cream for Desert and it wasn't good at all the ice cream was hard as a rock and couldn't even spoon it apart. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it was Super Mex and will continue too come back! Love this place! They bring you out chips with a delicious salsa and re-fried beans to dip in while you contemplate what to order. I have tried a few dishes here and they were ALL good.. most recently they had a special that was a chile rellano filled with ground beef and covered in a chipotle cream sauce...MMMMMMMM!  They have the BEST shrimp soft tacos as well... so addicting! I also like their chicken rice bowl, it comes with cilantro lime rice which is the bomb.com and you get a huge portion for only $5 (enough for dinner and lunch the next day)  The one thing I really miss was when it was Super Mex they had an \"Antojito combo\" that I loved and they no longer have this available...boooo. It came with mini chimichangas and adobo wings that were DELISH! Jalisco PLEASE bring this back for me!!!! ;)"}
{"text":"I was craving some good late night Mexican food with my fellow Yelpers and we decided to check out one of the best happy hours at Supermex. To our surprise, Supermex was re-branded into Jalisco Cantina. Undeterred, we came in to familiar surroundings and sat down near the bar.  Though the restaurant looks the same as before, the menu has undergone some changes and unfortunately not all are for the better. There was no happy hour menu available and after finally getting the attention of our server/bartender, he quickly mouthed off a couple dishes on HH and left us. Unlike before, only select appetizers were half off and the portions/recipes have definitely changed. I wanted to order the chicken street tacos but our server quickly corrected us that they are now called the Tacos Tijuana and for whatever reason only the carne asada ones were covered under HH, no chicken. We also ordered guacamole as an appetizer and Mexican Pizza (new item!). Note: chips and salsa were included as well!  When we got the guacamole I was left wondering if the cook forgot to mash up the avocado. Now I don't mind big chucks, but this guacamole was really just diced avocados in pico de gallo.   Unfortunately, the new Tacos Tijuana are nothing like what they used to be. Instead of the three generous street tacos before, I got two reduced size carne asada tacos with some rice and beans. The tacos fell victim to 'soggy tortilla syndrome' where the contents escaped to all over my plate. I really wish they didn't change it up as the street tacos were delicious and a great meal in themselves.  Now the Mexican Pizza was a pleasant surprise. Like the tacos, for whatever reason the happy hour special only covered the chicken toppings. The pizza was a good portion, with plenty of chicken, mushrooms, and cheese on a thin but crispy toastada like base. Definitely a great new edition to the menu.  Our server was terrible to put it nicely. He took about ten minutes to come up to us, and seemed annoyed when we asked him to repeat the list of ~8 happy hour options (they really should just print out a list). He never brought us out our utensils and we had to flag him down over and over for refills. Maybe he was just having a bad day but he just seemed hurried and uninterested, and there weren't even that many people in the bar area.   I give kudos to the management for changing up the menu and trying new things but I really wish they didn't downsize some of their better dishes. I used to come here twice a month when it was Supermex but now I'm wondering if I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"LOVE. May I repeat LOVE the food here. Great portions, amazing salsa, and the food always keeps me coming back for more! Although the service when walking in could be greater the food makes it all worth it. They have lunch specials and late night ones as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm addicted! I use to go to the other location on Durango all the time. I drive all the way to Summerlin for this food! Service is great and the food is amazing. Never a bad time here."}
{"text":"The offerings are authentic, tasty and shall return soon! Satisfied with the service and atmosphere was inviting, clean and pleasing. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and very clean. Everything was great, from the super nice hostess who greeted us, to our wait person, Janeth, to the food. First was a test of the salsa, this can make, or break, a restaurant for me. Fortunately, the salsa was excellent! Next, a wild mushroom quesadilla for an appetizer. The quesadilla was stuffed with sautéed mushrooms, cheese and grilled onions. It also came with a generous portion of guacamole. I had Tijuana street tacos, with carne asada,  they were very flavorful, and the tortillas were fresh. My husband had the shrimp burrito (A La plancha). I could not believe how much shrimp was in the burrito; it was STUFFED with large shrimp. We will definitely make this place one of our regular haunts."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I had been here a few times when it was Super Mex, but I think they have definitely improved with the name change.   I really liked their chips, salsa & bean dip. We also ordered a quesadilla for an appetizer and it was really good. Although I don't know how anyone can screw up a quest Dillard's.  :)  Unfortunately, I stuffed myself, and then I could barely eat my yummy Mexican Pizza. But not to worry it was equally delicious later that night at home. Next time I definitely want to see if they can make the Mexican Pizza with a corn tortilla instead.   The bf ordered the Tequila Sunrise and he was very happy with it. I tried a bite, but I was already so stuffed. We definitely over ordered.   I also really enjoyed the Margarita. I'm not usually a tequila drinker but it sounded good at the time. Just the right amount of salt on the rim. Delicious!"}
{"text":"(Mexican used to be my favorite food; then I found ramen.)  For the two years that I lived in Vegas, this was my go-to Mexican place.  That's in part because of the experience and in part because of the never-ending Groupon that's offered.  Last time I got it (just last week), you could get $20 of food for $11, and the food is already priced fairly.  One thing I found unique about this place, and I'm not sure why other Mexican places don't do it, is that they bring a bowl of refried beans with the chips and salsa.  I regularly found myself clean two bowls of those beans before ever getting my food.  I've only had one dish here: chicken enchiladas.  I get two, one red, one mole.  Mole sauce isn't an option on the menu, so you just have to ask for it.  If you love large portions, this is the perfect place to come.  I always left over-stuffed, and I rarely finished my plate.  All told, with the Groupon, you and a friend can get two entrees and only have to pay about $5 additional dollars.  This probably isn't the best Mexican in Vegas; but it's the best I've had."}
{"text":"What can I say. Food fantastic, bartender Matt also our server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. First time here certainly not the last."}
{"text":"This is place used to be known as Super Mex. Let me tell you, since they changed the name, and added new items to their menu, this place has gotten way better! In short, Super Mex was good, but Jaliscos is GREAT!  My husband and I are regulars here. The wait staff have gotten to know us over the years, and we are always greeted with a smile. The dining area has a darkened atmosphere, and the long booths offer a bit of privacy when you're dining.   The menu is expansive and offers a taste of true Mexico. The shredded beef tacos are a must-order as they are bursting at the seams with juicy, succulent beef; and are finished off with lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of cheese. My only wish is that they were bigger... Haha!  The chillerellenos are also delicious. They are fried to perfection, and every bite is oozing with cheese. I'd suggest the two or three items combo plates so that you can try a little bit of everything on this splendid menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! We had a rehearsal dinner here with 25 people and I am beyond disappointed with the food and the service. Tacky paper menus, drinks ordered that we never received, they didn't clear our table of dirty plates before dinner and before desert, plates just pilled up and when I asked if they could be cleared I got attitude from our 1 waitress. Food was nothing special. You can tell they weren't interested nor did they care about us. You think with such a big party knowing we were spending more money they would care a little more. I can say for sure we will never be back."}
{"text":"Taking pictures of food is pretty much second-nature if you're an asian girl or an elite yelper. Being both, I realized today that although mexican food tastes great, it is probably the least photogenic. It always looks like a mama bird regurgitated on my plate. Refried beans and melted cheese will never be model material, but it's what's on the inside that counts anyway, right? Get in my belly, you ugly plate you.  I ordered the 2-item combo ($9.95). You have your choice of: enchiladas, crispy/soft tacos, taquitos, or pork tamales. Some meats require an extra $1. I chose a chicken enchilada and a beef enchilada. Both were drowning in red sauce. Preferred the chicken over the beef, but even so it was nothing special. My bf got a chicken enchilada too, along with a shrimp soft taco. Shrimp tasted amazingly seasoned! Probably the only thing we both were instant fans of. Forgot to add that yes, they start you right off with complimentary chips with bean dip and salsa.   Everyone was friendly, but service extremely slow. We saw that there were two sets of new trainees and ours didn't seem to have communication. Two different servers asked us what we wanted to drink and later the same two came up individually asking us what we wanted to order. Our check took awhile to run and then even more time to come back to us.  Tip: There's a Groupon for $12 for $20 worth of food, but you can't order items from their value menu if you do so. Either way, you're saving about the same amount anyway. Olé!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend had a group on for this restaurant so we decided to give it a try.  It was about 10 at night and I ordered the Mexican pizza.  I can honestly say that I had a good experience and the waitress was awesome.  Her name was Imelda.  My drink never got below the halfway mark and she was there on point.  The music was a little loud but it was tolerable.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Hands down, me and my fiance's favorite Mexican restaurant! This is the first time I've ever reviewed a restaurant online, but I felt I had to spread the word. We've brought several friends here and when they ask us what to order we tell them anything on the menu because it's all so good. We have tried several different dishes and have never been disappointed. My personal favorite is the Tequila Sunrise Enchiladas del Mar...the creamy chipotle sauce is amazing! They have daily specials for under $10 and those are always good. Chips, refried bean dip, and salsa are complimentary. The bean dip is especially delicious, we always have to order refills. This restaurant is a must try!"}
{"text":"My secret spot for good food. Piece of mind and value. Matt the bartender is amazing and always great company on the graveyard shift!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Given wrong menu when we walked in. Then waited 30 minutes before someone finally came over they told us we had the wrong menus, replaced then, and then never came back. Waited another 20 minutes before having to flag a waiter down to get the check. He shrugged us off and never came back with it. Finally had to go to the bar to pay for the single round of drinks we had and leave. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. With service like that I see an available restaurant space in the near future."}
{"text":"Basically the best Mexican restaurant I ever been to hands down. The reason why is because of the nice customer service, the ease of reading the menu, and the authentic Mexican / Latin dishes. I love this place, it's very cheap and definitely worth every penny. The drinks of one of the best tasting. Sangrias are my favorite!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Mexican food! When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good.   I ordered \"Tacos Del Campo\" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the \"Casero Burrito\" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly.   Jalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.  Currently they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Just had a GREAT dinner, out waiter Ramero was AWESOME with an amazing smile. We enjoy a good meal in a pleasant atmosphere EVERYTIME we're here.  Thanks Again, Jalisco's"}
{"text":"Their tequila sunrise seafood dish was really good.  The service was good...the all around atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick solo lunch.  Service was friendly and fast; food was fresh and tasty...especially the bacon wrapped shrimp!  Didn't have time for a 'Rita, but will surely check them out again to indulge soon."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times.  They always have deals with Groupon or Amazon Local or in the Entertainment.com book or coupons in mailers that are basically b1g1 or half off.  So that's a huge plus -- my girlfriend and I can go for basically $20 after tax, and the dishes are so huge that we each end up taking a box home for another meal later.  It's a bit dark inside, but the decor is nice.  High ceilings, lots of space, and it never seems to be super busy.  There's a video poker bar attached to the restaurant if you feel so inclined.  Service here has always been great.  Complementary chips and beans/salsa (and free refills!) while you're waiting for your food is great.  The wait has never been overly long, either.    As for the food, it's always been delicious.  I usually get the 3 item plate for $13 and get a variety of enchiladas and tacos.  I've had some of the burritos and chimichangas as well.  Everything is good.  No complaints, and good value for your money -- even if you don't have a coupon.  I've been here at least a half dozen times in a few months and will probably go another dozen times this year!"}
{"text":"Went here when it was Super Mex so we decided to try it out. Service was painfully slow....it took forever for our appetizer and drinks to come out. The server was very apologetic, even though it wasn't her fault. Mexican pizza was average, wouldn't order again. I ordered the carne asada street taco and it was good.  The del campo street taco was horrible. I took one bite and didn't eat the rest. Chips and salsa and bean dip were average. Nothing special. Don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"Bean dip is awesome! Food was great! All around good experience.  Salsa has a different taste, not hot but almost a sweet and spicy combo. Service was good but we did feel a little rushed on our Saturday lunch. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Been a while since we been here, sat in the bar area. Service was ok; only 5 people in the bar; 2 staff members (not sure what 1 guy was doing), one guy seemed to be the waiter n bartender n runner. Foor was ok."}
{"text":"Visited this place from a groupon ad as a visitor from dallas. Coming from a city that is saturated in Tex-Mex. This by far is the most amazing Mexican food I have ever had! Must visit each time I come to town."}
{"text":"For a change not over spiced which means the meat is edible and does not have to be disguised.  Service a little slow but thoughtful.  Be careful of the liquor though that is chintzy."}
{"text":"Went for dinner the other night and was back for breakfast.  Jalisco's was a nice surprise with super friendly and attentive service.  Food was much better than average, warm and fresh - not overly greasy.  Chips were warm and fresh.  Did I mention the servers (of course I did, but they deserve another mention)?  Both times at Jalisco's the staff were friendly & attentive but not overbearing.  Really makes the experience so much better seeing smiling faces, pleasant voices and regularly having my water & coffee topped off.  Jalisco's was a nice surprise, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just went in, waited along with a three other groups that were there ahead of us just standing there waiting to be seated. No one acknowledged us or said a word. Lots of empty tables that were cleaned. Saw no food coming out of the kitchen. Waited 10 minutes. Walked out. They probably didn't notice. We loved it when it was Super Mex... bummer.  We were starving. Last time was a let down as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was super mex. The food is close to what super mex had but with a little more of a authentic Mexican style. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant about once per month because it is the closest Mexican restaurant to my home and office... People are laid back, so the service is good, but not formal.  More like a neighborhood bar/restaurant. I always enjoy the food and sometimes I wind up here when they have blues music.  That is always a treat.  Yes, prices are a bit higher than during the depths of the great recession, but everything is higher, now.  But, the main thing to me at a Mexican restaurant is that they have good chips and salsa....  Jalisco's chips and salsa are very good."}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday night. Jalisco marguerita the best. My wife had chili verde bowl and I had beef taco with chicken enchilada meal,both from value menu. Service was great, fast and friendly. All the food is delicious including chips, salsa and bean dip. Our meal with shared flan (fantastic) and one drink was under $30. My vote as best Mexican restaurant in Henderson. And we took food home!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal and accomadating for our group!! Enormous taco salads all around and I just had to grab a carne asada burrito to go, after seeing the neighboring tables... to die for! I'll definitely be coming back alone or with friends and family!! The ambiance and layout are perfect for any size party, and the bar is open late (: !!! Hopefully I can get another get together for the live music night. ***** 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food ...great!....people. ..great! Best bartender Ceaser! Jalisco is the real deal...but sit in the bar for the best service!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Arrived at  6:45 pm for a party of 4.  It was packed and we waited 30 minutes for a table. We were seated and our drink orders were taken.  Two ordered cokes and we ordered margaritas with no salt.  After 10 minutes we told our waitress we did not get our drinks.  She stated the bar was making it.  Another 15 minutes went by and now our food was here.  We again told the waitress, we still don't have our drinks.  In a dumbass tone she said \"we are out of glasses.\"  We were half way finishing our food when the margaritas finally arrived.  Both had salt.  We will never again come here and the drinks should have been complimentary.  A very bad experience.......who in the heil runs out of glasses?  Should have poured it in water glasses!!!!"}
{"text":"I mean seriously Yelpers, I'm getting so tired of your positive reviews over restaurants that totally stink! Leaving positive reviews for crappy places like this are starting to make me wonder if you know much better than McD's quality, This place cannot even fry a taco shell crisp! They were like wilted sorry wet tortillas on my plate. The chicken and beef both tasted like Alpo dog food, and the taquitos were soft and wet as well. They weren't even deep fried,they were grilled. To top that off, this place focuses on filling you up with carbs instead of protein. All of their burritos have rice and beans inside them, a total sign that their gonna be cheap with their meat portions. You guys would be better off closing your doors then continuing to think that your food quality or taste is anything better than crap. Fast food chains have crispier tacos than you guys! I'm so tired of crappy restaurants popping up all over town thinking you have us fooled! You will be gone before you blink an eye; and luckily you only got $30. bucks of mine. Do us all a favor and go back to Jalisco to learn how to cook Mexican food. Nobody wants your over wet plates of soggy tortillas and crappy quality meats. Oh and I almost forgot, their menu is upcharge central on their combo plates if you want your meat upgraded to carnitas or carne asada, and even if you want a chile relleno it's pay more! WTH Jalisco? You go bye bye now..."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Mexican spots which I have ate! Prices were reasonable. The staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are usually somewhat hesitant about trying new places~ we have our favorites and pretty much stick to them. Jalisco Cantina has certainly become our Mexican food favorite. It's a quaint, casual restaurant with a separate bar area- traditionally decorated with booths & tables. Staff has always been attentive & courteous.   When we initially started going there they had a small menu but with all the basics. Now they have a very extensive menu serving and abundance of options including breakfast. Since I am such a creature of habit I always get their shrimp & lobster ceviche along their fresh guacamole. I always intend to order other items but by the time I finish indulging in the ceviche I am stuffed! My hubby normally sticks to his beef & cheese enchiladas along with the shredded beef barbacoa taquitos.   The portions are generous and pricing is very reasonable. We've never been disappointed or left hungry!"}
{"text":"I had a fabulous time at Jalisco Cantina and was very impressed. It is conveniently located right off the 215 at Sunset, and there was ample close parking. The atmosphere is pleasant and homey. The video poker bar is completely separate from the restaurant area, and the décor is very tasteful. The service staff is absolutely great. Everybody was extremely friendly and accommodating, not to mention super fast. And the food was fabulous. As authentic as I have found in Las Vegas. I have lived in Las Vegas for 21 years and try as many of the Mexican restaurants in town as I can. They make their guacamole in 3 styles from fresh, whole avocados. I sampled the clasico and the camaron tropical with shrimp and mango. Both were excellent! They also make all of their tortillas fresh in-house, as well as their chips -  which were as good as they get. They have over 90 items on the menu, so selection isn't a problem! I also had 2 different margaritas, the top shelf and the spicy. Both were excellent! I tackled their \"muy caliente\" salsa and about caught on fire! And I can usually handle hot! Not for the faint LOL - won't be doing that again! The mild was excellent, had ample spice and flavor, and was more my speed I guess! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for the bacon wrapped shrimp and carne asada combo...amazing. Today my family and I came and the service was exceptional, Marissa was our server, super nice, attentive, not overwhelming and kept our drinks full. That happens to be one of my pet peeves. Kudos!!"}
{"text":"Went there at 2am.. Bought food & drinks, it was all great!!! I had a shrimp taco & steak taco, GREAT!! I also had the bacon wrapped shrimp, OMG Soooooooo good! I had to order some of that to go! Most places when it get late they get sloppy but not here! Food was still on point!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. Margarita was delicious and OMG their pork is out of this world!!! Service was also amazing. What a find."}
{"text":"The grilled shrimp tacos were very good....guacamole was fresh and the portion was huge...my husband loved the carne asada tacos.  All in all, a great value for the price. We will be back..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Everyone is nice and friendly. Our waitress was Janeth very nice and sweet. They didn't have the ice cream I wanted but she handled it very well. She didn't bug us like some people do( sometimes over checking on your customers is to much) she was great. Made sure we had drinks. Always smiled. What I loved is even when I spoke English she replied in English I hate when people look at me and think I know Spanish. She was great! Keep up the good job!!!  My second time here and can't wait till next time"}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed street tacos and got one fish and one vegetarian. The vegetarian one had beer battered avocados with fresh mango salsa. They were both so good it made me feel like I was eating tacos on the beach in Mexico! Very fresh and yummy tasting!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place which was very surprising to me. I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant here that I am crazy about but I really liked the food! Went for breakfast and had the barbacoa plate. The meat had not fat at all and was not greasy and fat like that kind of meat normally is! It came with eggs, potatoes, and tortillas. The portion was great and so was the price. They have a good selection for breakfast lunch and dinner. They have a full bar and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"A co-worker had a birthday celebration here - definitely not impressed. Service was very bad, especially at the bar; both bartenders had bad attitudes and our drinks took forever. The bartenders would literally walk to the back of the bar, stand around a bit, chat with a waitress, then finally decide it would be a good time to start making our drinks. They had also 'run out of glasses' so our only option was plastic cups (you know, the classy red solo ones - made me want to get some beer pong started). The place wasn't crowded and we had a reservation - how is a place like this not ready for us?   Worst of all, food was extremely dry and not tasty at all. This place goes on the avoid list for sure."}
{"text":"Yo quiero Jalisco! Service was quick and efficient. I had the chimichanga and my wife had the street tacos, both of which were excellent. The food did tend to be on the spicier side for this suburban Jewish kid. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with how good the food and service was. Definitely try the carnitas or birria beef burritos, they were very meaty and too big to finish. The atmosphere was relaxed yet festive, and definitely not cheesy like some of the other Mexican restaurants with the obnoxiously loud music and overkill decor. If you want a step above the Mexican fast food places but not an overpriced themed restaurant, you should try Jalisco!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the food this place would only get 1 star....  Total Nightmare!  The Service was HORRIBLE! we came in for Dinner and I understand that it was late night, a little after Midnight, and there is only One Bartender, however, as sweet as she later became, she was a mess, 2 players in total at the bar, we walked in she was on her phone behind the cash register, we stood at the bar to ask for a menu and let her know we wanted a booth in the bar area as we did not want to sit up at the bar, she took more then a few minutes to greet us, finally we told her that we wanted to have a seat at the booth, she said okay, ill bring out some menus, 5 minutes went by so I went up to her at the bar where she was on her phone, and I asked for a draft the menu and a drink for my date, she handed me both I asked for an order of Chips and Salsa to start off with, and I went back to the booth so we could go over your menu. THE MENU HERE IS GREAT BTW. After 5 more minutes of waiting for her to take our order or bring out the chips and salsa, another lady who she had been talking to behind the bar brought out our chips and salsa and apologized for the service, and said ill tell her you are ready to order... this lady had to have been a guest as she was wearing a Putters Bar T-shirt... We were weirded out that someone other then an employee went back to get our Chips and Salsa... If it wasnt for us already being here so long and already ordering a drink We would have just left, I had to go back up to the bar to place my order......    The cook was amazing, he brought out our food in a timely manner after I had gone up to order, he described to us what we had ordered and even asked if we needed anything else, any more chips and salsa and if everything looked good. He could barely speak english but he was not hard to understand and totally made a great representation.    THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT! The Shrimp Mexican Pizza, and the Ceviche were really really Good! I would recommend the food however I would have to mention the service....  I am not sure if I would come back, and Its a shame becuse the food was superb however the Service from Our bartender was just shitty. She was sweet towards the end and did check on us Once after our food had already came out, she said she was new to this location however I don't think that excuse had anything to do with her customer service I just wish she had a little better training in the Hospitality department especially with her being a graveyard bartender, thats the time a lot of service industry workers come have dinner and play the machines!"}
{"text":"Great enchiladas and tortilla soup.  The soup is actually a tomato based soup and it definitely hits the spot. Order extra cheese to go in it. Yummy!"}
{"text":"So me and about 4 other friends have been coming here for MNF for the last 4 years. We drink, eat and gamble. They just changed their happy hour menu and man IDK who came up with its Just horrible. Trying to a save buck is going to cost them customers. We aren't the only ones complaining. 1 MNF game left we will head over and try the new place around the corner next week. Sad because Jalisco's a lot of great food they could have put on their new HH menu."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan!!! After an awful day including my car breaking down, being towed, and $$$ later....I was at Pep Boys (thats another story) and found out that my car wouldn't be done until the next day. My friend and I wandered a few stores down and saw Jalisco Cantina where we decided to grab a drink as we waited for a cab. I am SO happy we did!   We sat in the bar area which had an awesome screen showing the Thursday night football game. The bartender was AWESOME, I think his name was Alan, and he was helpful and attentive. He suggested and explained multiple items on the menu, brought some chips and salsa, and had a great knowledge of the tequila as well. Since we didn't know when the cab would arrived, he suggested we get something to-go and we could snack on it there if they hadn't came yet which worked out perfectly!  Also, the chips and salsa were amazing. I am a huge critic of Mexican food in Las Vegas, to be honest I think most of it is horrible. Every restaurant I've been to has pretty mediocre if not bad salsa, adding things that shouldn't be in salsa. However the salsa at Jalisco was delicious! They even have a habanero salsa that is crazy hot-I may have overestimated my heat tolerance by bragging too much then eyes watering as I took a huge bite. :) hahah oops! It was still really tasty though, just super spicy which I love! The tacos we took to go were really good as well, I will definitely be back for a full dinner!"}
{"text":"- I found out about this place through Groupon, & it was pretty good! - We were seated right away. - The service was great! - They have albondigas soup! And it was delicious! Not many places have albondigas soup. - Their queso fundido is to die for! The cheese that they use is amazing! - I also love their complimentary salsa! - They have a separate bar/gaming area if you like that sort of thing. - It was nice & quiet. (I hate loud restaurants)"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 2am on a Friday because we wanted beer and some Mexican food after getting off work. Well, we got the beer, but waited almost an hour for our food... I have to mention that we were the ONLY 2 people ordering food. The bartender kept coming over and apologizing that it was taking so long... but I'm still confused WHY it took as long as it did. They only offer half the menu that late at night, and it's not like we were ordering extravagant meals. When our food finally came out it was absolutely inedible. The shrimp in my burrito was burnt, as was my boyfriends fish, chicken, and shrimp tacos... We had to flag down the bartender to tell her we just couldn't eat the food. So we ended up leaving, still hungry, an hour and $20 later..."}
{"text":"This used to be the Super Mex... but now has even yummier food than it did before seated immediately chips and salsa brou5 to us within minutes. .. ordered with  our waitress within 4 minutes  of sitting  down... food is fresh hot and quick... quiet place no loud noise or music environment is cozy .. mi casa es sue casa best Spanish  i know... 5 stars for this  girl"}
{"text":"Large portions of yummy Mexican at a reasonable price is great! 2 people could really share a 3 item combo along with chips and salsa that are INCLUDED..We had strawberry marguerita as our appetizer and they were good too! We have been going since it was Super Med and it continues to please. Watch for the several 2 for coupons they offer in the Entertainment Book."}
{"text":"Had a long wait for a, flight so decided to give this place a try. Was not disappointed. The bacon wrapped shrimp were incredible. They serve you chips and salsa with a cup of warm beans that were really good. The food was really great. Service was quick and friendly. Will make this anytime Im in Vegas."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but the last few times it was not as great as it used to be. Today was one of the worst. My husbands taco shells were dripping with grease and my fish tacos had one piece of fish in each that was overcook. There were only 3 tables of couples at the time so not busy at all. The worst thing was our service. She brought our food and never came back to check on us or fill our empty glasses. I kept looking at her and she was at the counter the entire time chatting with the staff.  It wasn't just our table, she didn't check on any of the other tables either. We waited over 30 minutes after our food was served and I finally had to stop her to hand her the credit card.   This will probably be our last time in there for awhile since it literally left a bad taste."}
{"text":"No complaints but no accolades.  Their food is just OK.  The beans are bland but they give them to you complimentary.  The spicier salsa was ok.  We had the chicken bowl, salad and a beef enchilada.  Nothing spectacular.  Good deal if you buy the Groupon.  Otherwise, stick to the lunch specials.  Not terribly authentic."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was old Super Mex, so I was expecting pretty much the same. It was just a weird experience.  From the beginning, the design outside in the front is weird. I guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave, but it just looks really bad. Also, the front says 24 Hour Video Poker, which I just found strange. Yes to promoting 24 hours, NO to video poker. Just makes it seem like it's going to be really crappy bar food or something.   The host who sat us seemed like he had no idea how to host. He just seemed lost, but it wasn't a big deal. We got seated very quickly. We were greeted by our server, Jose, who was great. He convinced us to get Margaritas in spirit of Fat Tuesday. He wasn't pushy at all, very friendly and nice. He took our order, and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he won't be our server tonight. Poor Jose was being sent home because it was slow. It was strange as it wasn't super slow in there. It was even stranger that Jose seemed to linger on about this, almost to the point of talking down about the establishment. It was sad, I liked Jose and wanted to give him a tip but I didn't have change and he had to leave.   We were told of the special, which sounded like Chic Parm, except substitute chicken with steak. It sounded awful so we went with Carne Asada and my friend got Shrimp tacos. My carne asada, for the price they charged, was pretty wack. You expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender. It lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada. The rice and the refried beans were good though. Shrimp tacos were all right as well.  Then it just took forever to A) get the bill and B) get the server to get the money back to pay the bill. In the meantime I had a random woman (guessing it's the owner) asking me if everything was all right. It was, it was just strange. Who are you? Are you the owner? Random patron? What is going on in this place?!  Finally got someone to pick up my check. The total was $19 and some change. I put in a twenty. I get it back and I get no change. I mean we're talking about like 50 cents or so, but really? I didn't get any change back? All right?   I'm not mad about the experience, it was just really underwhelming. I love Mexican food. I think this place has just a major image issue. What is it? Is it an authentic Mexican restaurant with Jalisco specific recipes? Or is it like the Mexican version of PTs? Or is it Mexican version of Applebees? Is Jalisco spanish for Applebees?"}
{"text":"We've eaten here before and enjoyed it. Came with a group of 11 people tonight, though, and had truly terrible service. We ordered drinks and when they hadn't come after 90 minutes, we canceled our order. The food only took a bit more than an hour to arrive.  While we were waiting, a couple members of our party finally went into the kitchen and got some pitchers of water and glasses for us.  This level of service is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Talk about not judging a book by its cover.  We have been coming to this strip mall for 3-4 years and have never ventured into Jalisco Cantina because from the outside it doesn't look inviting.  Once you walk through those doors you are welcomed with smiles and a bright inviting environment.  The food was very good here, probably the best I have found in Las Vegas so far.  I ordered street tacos and they were D E L I C I O U S, even the refried beans were flavorful.  Their homemade salsa is not very spicy, but has a lot of flavor.  Hubby ordered the machaca and was VERY happy with his meal.  Service is happy and fast.  Definitely have a new mexican joint in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food service very good, salsa is the best , take some home to see if you like it. I have been going since it first open up , I have been to the so cal location Super Mex. is a good brand in so cal did not do well here maybe it is the location. Jalisco Cantina still has the good food and service plus now they have music try it out you might like it. Bar service is great it is a small bar compared to other Bars in the area."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  The Ceviche is the best!!! Service is excellent and very accommodating.  Gretchen provided great service.  Thanks all!!"}
{"text":"Jalisco has great food, I go here a few times a month and as a regular I get treated pretty well."}
{"text":"Good food,  good service,  what a hidden gem! My husband Ordered the  Chef special,  he finished it he is usually not a Mexican food Eater but he loved it!  Had their carnitas special,  loved it.  Mango Margarita was awesome not too sweet!"}
{"text":"Used a groupon  ordered a la cartel taco, shrimp enchilada & chile relleno. Taco & chile relleno was great! Don't waste your time w the shrimp enchilada."}
{"text":"I ordered the carnitas nachos and they are wicked awesome. The servings are huge, the service is great, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Had a lunch special that was one of THE best tasting, unique dishes I have ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  Don't be afraid to go \"off menu\" here!    Restaurant recently changed name & decor but not ownership (I asked).  Great value menu available 24/7.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving some chips and salsa. Upon entering, this place looked closed. I'm talking no one around, no hostess, and I had to flag down a waiter to get us seated.   Carne asada burrito- 4 stars. The meat in it was juicy and yummy. I think one of the best carne asada burrito I've had in Vegas so far.   Mini chimichanga- 3 stars. Was okay.   Service- 2.5 stars. These guys, dunno what they're doing when there's only 2 tables including ours that were booked. I'd only come back for the burrito, but it's not to die for so I'd probably not come back for a while."}
{"text":"Decent food but chicken has no flavor! Drink prices are good and especially during happy hour or a nfl or college game!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from LA, and were looking for a good Mexican restaurant.  After quite a few disappointments, we finally found Jalisco Cantina.  First of all, it's a nice place to eat.  The environment and decor are pleasant, and it's an inviting, attractive, comfortable place.  Definitely not fast-food Mexican.  The chips and salsa were excellent, and the Chicken Chimichangas that I had were excellent, and huge.  The sauce on the seafood enchiladas was not exactly to my wife's taste, but I thought they were good nonetheless.  My overall feeling is that the food is very well prepared, ingredients taste very fresh, and it's definitely worth exploring the menu further.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Decided to go check this place out on account of a 12 for 20 Groupon they were currently offering. Glad I did. I went by myself on a Saturday evening and decided to sit at the bar. Omar was the bartender, and he was super friendly and helpful. He offered me a menu, some chips and salsa/bean dip, and a beverage, and insisted I ask any questions I may have. Salsa was good, and the beans were beans.  I inquired about the beef Birria burritos at which point he offered to let me try it and brought out a healthy sample, it was delicious! Decision made! I asked how it came and I was told I could have it however I wanted it, with an offering of all the general burrito filters (beans, rice, cilantro, etc.) The meat was cooked perfectly and the food was delicious and plentiful. I had never had birria, which is a way of cooking and seasoning the meat, but I would definitely have it again. Omar and even some of the regulars had me feeling right at home.  Bill for two beers, a shot of Jamison, and my meal came to 25 bucks (not accounting for the Groupon) which I thought was more than reasonable. I will be back."}
{"text":"Attentive service! Our receipt said our server's name was Juan. Never ran out of water or the unlimited chips, salsa, and bean dip. Salsa was tasty and had a little bit of a kick. Large portion sizes. Less pricy compared to Lindo Michoacan. The signature carnitas was pretty good."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had lunch here for the second time. I'm not sure why it took me so long to return because I really enjoyed my lunch each time.  My first visit was on a weekday and keeping lunch to an hour was no problem. My second visit was on a Saturday afternoon and service was efficient and friendly on this visit as well.  Since I couldn't narrow my options I went for a Three Item Combination. My choices were Chile Relleno, Chicken Enchilada, Beef Taquito, and Chicken Taquito. Taquitos count as one choice. I haven't had a ton of chile rellenos, but this was my favorite so far. The flavor was great and the breading was still crispy. The taquitos were crispy and I liked the cheese on top. The red enchilada sauce was very tasty and the chicken inside was nice and tender. The beans and rice on the side were fairly standard and met my craving.   My husband had the Torta Ahogada. This was served on a large torta bun, stuffed with carnitas, and then smothered in a red sauce. It was a fork and knife torta and my husband enjoyed it.  Pricing on their meals is more than reasonable. It ended up being a bargain for the amount of food. Jalisco's also offers coupons in the mail, Groupons on occasion, and an offer in the Entertainment Book. If you have one of these offers you'll find it to be a great deal for good food.  The restaurant seemed clean and had a fairly large dining room with a nice size bar as well. The parking lot is large and offers plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Tacos were not the greatest but all in all good was pretty good.  lacking customer service and menu variety but good prices and value menu."}
{"text":"As far as Mexican food goes, and especially Mexican food you can get in Vegas, Jalisco falls flat for me.  I set up a lunch meeting here with a client because it was close to her work. When we arrived at 11:30 AM the place was quite vacant - to be expected. But even as we sat for an hour+ it never filled up for lunch time.  Chips and dips came out quickly - a boring bean (but at least warm!) dip, and a watery salsa. Thus far not impressed. I ordered a hot tea, expecting, well a regular 'ol tea and I was brought out a Green Tea. Well, okay, I'll drink Green Tea, sure, but when someone orders quote, \"A hot tea\" - they typically just want a brown, regular 'ol tea - not GREEN tea.   Being that I was entertaining le client, I ordered up some guac which came out and looked very pretty, but fell completely flat taste-wise. It had both myself and my client reaching for the salt shaker. There was not even any hint of lime which made me question just what the heck was going on in this place.  Entrees came out many, many minutes later (service was SLOW). I ordered a combination plate (1 carne asada enchilada, and 1 shrimp taco). Taco was filled with very good, plump shrimp. I enjoyed it - it had a bit of a sauce in it, but not too much. Filler/shrimp/sauce was very well balanced. Moving onto the carne asada enchilada - very sad little guy (SMALL ENCHILADA) with not enough sauce on the outside, and dry meat on the inside. Beans and rice were OK.  Overall this was a lackluster experience. Food was so-so, ambiance was meh, and service was on the BLAH side.   If you're in the area and you need a place to go eat Mexican, this will do, but it is nothing special."}
{"text":"After I ate here.. everything else taste like taco bell.. the chips and salsa alone are enough to die for .. the tacos are so good you would think they FedEx them from Mexico .. and don't eat the friend ice cream or you going to have to go to rehab that thing is addictive .. my favorite go to spot for Mexican dishes they are the best in town!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had lunch here just about every weekend for the last 10 years (started when it was SuperMex) and we both agree that it's by far our favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas,  We have tried just about every other well reviewed Mexican restaurant in town but the highest rating I would give any of them would be 3 stars."}
{"text":"The salsa was mild, cool and fresh and served with a side of warm refined beans and fresh chips. Delicious.  Nice ambiance, fast friendly service, good food. Used a Groupon for extra savings. Ordered the Chicken Bacon burrito and Ceviche."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some good Mexican Food, and thought SuperMex would fit the script. Arrived to learn that it is now Jalisco Cantina. Menu seemed similar, so I thought what's the harm? I noticed many spots on the wall needed a paint touch up, but the new art being displayed was nice. Was promptly served tortilla chips with beans and salsa. The salsa had a good kick, but the beans were pretty bland. Ordered the chile rellano, and chicken enchiladas with rice. Our waiter gave us a plate with shredded beef enchiladas instead. Initially we were not too thrilled, but thankfully it was tasty. The rice, however, was lacking big time. The chile rellano was eh, and we never got any more chips. Makes me sad."}
{"text":"Came here at 11:20pm and their doors are locked.... This business should change their hours on yelp if they're not gunna be open on the hours it says it is... Booo"}
{"text":"This place was ok,  I'd like to try it again to see how consistent they are or try something else. I ordered their house special carnitas plate. It was good, they serve it with little pieces of chicharones which was different.  Rice and beans weren't bad.  My girlfriend got some rice bowl type of thing that came with barbacoa.  Also decent, her complaint was that it was salty, which I would have to agree, overall food was on the saltier side, so maybe avoid if you have high blood pressure. Overall not bad for vegas standards, which are terrible for mexican food. Still better than tasteless Lindo Michuacan that every is crazy about here...white people I swear..."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a full 5 stars for serving up one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. Mexican or otherwise. Bacon wrapped shrimp and Carne Asada steak with fresh sides. Good service and cool open kitchen. I will be back. Often."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty awesome.  I first came here along with coworkers because it was close to our work location.  Seems to be the go to for when the office is craving Mexican.  This place is clean and actually is pretty busy during lunch time.    They first serve you with their chips, salsa, and bean dip...all very simply, amazing!  I think I get carried away with it when I go there because I get full before my meal even arrives.    I usually like to order any of their burritos.  Its massive.  I first ordered the shrimp burrito because I thought it would be skimpy, boy was I wrong.  Shrimp in every single bite.  I was waay full by the time I got halfway.   You can sometimes find Groupon deals for this place, so shop smart so you can save yourself some money to attempt to try the whole menu :)"}
{"text":"Started with complimentary chips, beans and salsa. The salsa was tasty and the beans would have been perfect if they were hot, they came out barely warm. The waitress was very nice and was always around when I needed something. I ordered the carnitas burrito and this thing was a monster. Ive eaten alot of places where there is some meat and lots of filler but this was the complete opposite.  There was pork stuffed all the way through and it was delicious. The carnitas were so tender and flavor was really good. I shouldnt have eaten so many chips and salsa and maybe I could have eaten the whole thing. 70% isnt bad. Lol. I was hesitant going in since the name change from Super Mex but im glad I did and I will go back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken soft taco and mini chicken nachos and they tasted delicious. We had wonderful service and loved the happy hour prices!!"}
{"text":"I like this place better with each visit. Service, food, atmosphere- all great!  The chili verde, carnitas and carne asada are all outstanding.   Will update as we work our way thru the menu"}
{"text":"i come here all the time especially with the Groupon deal they have going on. I'm not head over heals for the  alcoholic drinks but the food is delish and i love how we also get unlimited bean dip along with her chips in salsa while we are waiting on our order."}
{"text":"This is the former Super Mex, just rebranded.  The menu is pretty much the same. If there are differences, they are slight and I didn't notice. Same goes for the prices. There is a current Groupon running, which is $11 for $20 worth of food. That makes this place a viable lunch option if I want Mexican food at a decent value other than Roberto's."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at this place and I was hoping for the same 5 star experience that I had the first time I came here. Last time I was here I gave this place a 5 star rating because of the food and outstanding service. This time I am giving this place a 2 star rating. It would get a 1 star but the shrimp was cooked perfectly like last time. Our server this time was ramon. His service was very poor. I would rate him 2 out of 5. Not very personable at all and took forever to keep getting his attention. We actually started to ask service from a different server who was not even in our section because she was more aware than our own server. My fiancé ordered a michalota but asked for bloody mary mix instead of clamoto. They just poured the bloody mary mix half way and filled the rest with beer. There was no spices or anything. We actually needed to order a second beer so she could finish it because all the bloody mary mix was solid on the bottom and using a second beer would be able to mix it. The food minus my shrimp was a little bland today. Overall the service was awful and that's why this place gets a lower rating this time. Not sure if I will be back. There are many other restaurants in Vegas that I can drive and give my money to..."}
{"text":"gross gross gross gross gross. Cold food (frozen quality), drinks ordered and not served, food ordered and forgotten. Blows my mind how a place like this stays in business. Not like it's hard to do, just care the tiniest little bit and things may improve. But as if now, one word....G.R.O.S.S.!"}
{"text":"The front signage of this place is huge. I thought it was a grocery store or something every time I drove by it. So I decided to give this place a try on Cinco de Mayo since my favorite Mexican restaurant is all the way in Summerlin and I am glad I did. Despite being a holiday and a crowd was already outside we were seated in less than the estimated 15 minutes given. The place smelled really good and there was quite a few people already dining which is a good sign. Lots of families and couples, but wasn't too loud. Friendly service and staff when we ordered. Food came out hot and pretty fast. Chips, salsa, and bean dip came complimentary. I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and there was red sauce all over it, so I didn't expect that, but didn't mind either. It was good though.Overall, it didn't take long for our food to come out (since we had a show to catch on The Strip), service was good and attentive, and I would come back to to try out their fajitas."}
{"text":"We have been going here since it was SuperMex. This place is very good and their customer service is always great.  They have a large selection of Mexican food. I love the fried jalapeño and onion appetizer and it's ONLY 3 DOLLARS!!! Great prices! Also, get the entertainment book, they have five or six two for one coupons for this place. You can't beat those deals.  Everything we've tried has been great. Love their carnitas and carne asada. They also have a very good hot salsa if you ask for it. Beware though, the hot salsa can be pretty hot.  We usually sit at the bar. Omar the bartender is awesome. He has amazing customer service skills and knows how to treat a customer. Can't say enough good about him.  If you like Mexican food, give this place a try. You'll probably love it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. We were seated immediately.  They automatically served complimentary chips with beans and a very thin salsa. My personal preference is salsa with big tomato chunks but the liquid salsa had a good flavor. I ordered the chicken enchilada, it was good and decently priced.   The decor is very cute. I would recommend this restaurant for a date however, it was open mic night and I found it to be  a little painful on the ears."}
{"text":"A decent place to go and play some video poker and have some margaritas and Mexican food. This place reminds me more of a local bar turned Mexican restaurant, but it is a pretty nice place. The margaritas are better than average for a local style bar."}
{"text":"So my fiance took me to Jaliscos tonight  and please believe me there was much to be desired. I started with a house Margarita which was good. I also ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer which had no salt  or flavor. For my entree I ordered the Street Tacos (one chicken and one steak) which again had no flavor.   The staff is nice and attentive but, as for the food. I wont be back! The place was packed but I  truly have no clue why."}
{"text":"Just had a happy hour snack at Jaliscos. Great chips and salsa.  Excellent bacon wrapped shrimp and pacifico on tap!!!  Highly recommend it!  BTW, ask for Edson...nice guy and good server!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years so I do love it. I love the service because everyone is so nice. Thank you for that btw. I would love warm chips and fideo to top off the experience. Great job people!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem really great mexican restaurant reminds me of cali mexican food really good customer service highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Salsa, bean dip, and the shrimp and mango guacamole we addicting! My husband had two margaritas... He has had better but you can't beat the price! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I normally   reviews to help guide my decisions on things.  I AM SUPER EXCITED AND HAPPY that I chose this place.  Omg, where do I begin.  I had the daily special which happened to be the grilled chicken breast with some special Pico de Gallo,  rice and beans   The food was beyond my expectations.  The chicken was soo soft and well seasoned. The beans were to die for.  The service was second to none, the ambiance relaxing and awesome and portion HUMONGOUS.  I will definitely be back when next I am in town."}
{"text":"Best service around good cold beer and on Tuesdays there is live music (jazz/blues). I have nothing bad to say if you enjoy American/ Mexican food this is a great place to eat or stop in the bar and have a cold beer. The staff will remember your name and what you like to drink."}
{"text":"Right when u sit they give you chips salsa n beans yummy I love beans with chips. Service was alil slow being that I was the only 1 here at 9am lol.... Margarita was good I had the regular De La Casa... Ordered chilaquilez (if thts how u spell it lol ) they were good. Wish it was spicy tho. Rice beans are good. I would definitely come back.. :)  Warning* Plates are very hot and they don't tell u till its on the table and u touch it. My Thumb still hurts :(  P.s I'm a picky person hard to impress :)"}
{"text":"Love. Love love!!! Fast service friendly staff excellent food great prices! I wouldn't hesitate recommending to  anybody. We take our family and friends there every time they come in to town.  They always rave about the food. Great salsa and chips too!!"}
{"text":"Came in today with a girl friend and we got Friendly quick service. The groupon deal is great 10 bucks for 20 dollars worth of food. I got the pork tacos and chicken tacos to go my friend got the chicken tacos too. Overall it was really good I'd definitely recommend and for sure coming back :)"}
{"text":"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! Came here while I waited for my car to be serviced and I was there for 1 hr. I came in just in time for Happy Hour and I got chips and salsa at the bar. I ordered 2 Bud Lights, and the Carne Asada Tacos Tijuana. My check was $7 something. The tacos were delicious and full of meat. They are not cheap when it comes to serving you meat. The tacos came with a side of rice and beans which were also delicious. Their salsa for the chips was superb as well. No complaints on my end at all! The bartender Allen was great and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick cheap lunch with el novio. Purchased the Groupon and in we went. There was no one to greet us and there was no one in the dining room so we went into the bar and were told by the bartenders to sit wherever we wanted.. Decided on a comfy booth in the bar area and then shortly after a server brought over some menus.   After ordering our food we decided on some happy hour dranks. The server told us the Groupon can not be used on Happy Hour.. which is the same as everywhere else but most places will just open a separate check for you.. Not here. That was fine though because I just made by man go to the bar and get our drinks there LOL How can you pass up $1 bud light and $2 margaritas?!!?  -I got the shredded Baracoa salad which comes in a taco shell and is really delicious! Lots of fresh avocado and they don't use cheap lettuce. -boyfriend got the 3 plate combo with carne asada tacos, beef taquitos, chicken enchilada, rice & beans.. This was just OK.  -chips, salsa & bean dip were good. We were not offered a refill~   The service from the server was alright. She did her job and nothing more. Although to make her life easier they should probably assign 1 room for seating so that she doesn't have to run through 3 separate dining areas. The female bartender was nice though ;]]]"}
{"text":"When this was Super Mex we loved it.   The food is still pretty good,  but watch out.   We were a table of 5 and when we got the check it seemed high.  Upon review, the server had changed the party # to 8, thereby guaranteeing her the 18% tip.   We had not noticed and put another 20% on there.   She would have received a $45 tip if we did not bring it to the managers attention.  The people next to us said she does it all the time.   They may be more patient than I am, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty convinient location- I had 2 taquitos and a shredded beef enchilada--- yummmm. Their salsa was a little mild for me *who eats sriracha on everything* but the flavor was good- and o thoroughly enjoyed my meal.   I love their yellow Spanish rice too! We will be definitely returning to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is okay...good music although it was dead inside. The staff was friendly although did not offer any personality and it appeared that she unhappy being there. The food was good for the prices and the margarita was decent as well. Again the overall experience could be summed up as okay."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...  Ive been going to this place for a pretty long time. However, it was when it used to be SuperMex. tonight was my second time visiting there after they changed.  I gota say that I am not happy with the joint. Super mex used to be a great place to get a cheap and delicious bite to eat. But now its gone :( I used to go in there all the time to enjoy some delicious chicken tortilla soup for around 5 bucks.. which was a great deal. the same soup now comes in a smaller bowl and is nearly double to price. I would have to say that 9 dollars for a bowl of soup is kinda ridiculous for a place like that  The first thing I experienced upon walking in the door was the hostess who gave me a menu COVERED in salsa and food. I opened it to find red sauce just running down the page as well as beans all over it. I told her that it was gross and to give me another one.. She then rolled her eyes and walked away with it.. Never to return with a new one. Finally our server comes out (who was the only reason this place didnt get a 1 star rating) and gave me a new one. Our servers name was Lisa and she was awesome. Very nice and very efficient. She even brought out new chips and salsa without having to be asked.. which is a huge bonus for me, as I love chips and salsa.  We then order our food. I had the Mole. The Mole was very generic.. Good.. but generic. The chicken however, was terrible.. It was very tough and chewy, and had alot of fat on it. I bit into a huge chunk of fat and instantly felt sick,  You could tell the chicken was not cooked in the sauce. I would assume it was thawed out, already cooked and was just warmed up, and covered with the sauce. My gf had the enchiladas, which werent bad, but also very generic in my opinion.   I gota say the only good reason to go there was the chips and the service.. But not for food. Which is sad because its mostly a restaurant.  It is also more expensive by far after the name change. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First let me say. I did like this place. The food is good and the service was not bad either. I was just not thrilled with some of the selection, and it is most definitely not the best Mexican food that I have ever had. I am not saying I will never go back. It is a decent meal, for a decent price and any place that has good fried ice cream gets at least one extra star from me."}
{"text":"They start you off with chips salsa and beans, which is awesome. It was really good I had the carnitas tostadas, mom had the beef Birria and she's picky about her Mexican food but she loved it. My boyfriend did get the wrong order but didn't say anything that's why I am not giving them 5 stars. Also we finished our drinks and the waitress never bothered to refill them. But over all very good."}
{"text":"Happy hour was amazing!! The street tacos were great with so much meat!!! Wish we lived here we would go all the time!!"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. Long wait times even though the place was only half full"}
{"text":"Excellent Service and decent food. I would recomend this place to anyone who is looking for decent friday night dinner, I love their server i think her name is marissa she is amazing this  was my 2 nd visit within a month, Food was good just was disappointed with the Fish Taco which i  regret not going with the server's advice for chicken Taco instead of Fish it didn't taste good. Everything else was good.Management should take care of the furniture, one of the table that i sat was broken. It's all about details."}
{"text":"This was the first time here since it changed over from Super Mex. We went for lunch. We were seated immediately and were given chips, salsa and bean dip. I like the chips much better than before. These are triangles as opposed to crispy whole tortillas. I ordered cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole. My daughter ordered the carne asada street tacos. Everything was very fresh and tasted very good. The guacamole was freshly made but was a little bland for me. I added a little bit of salt at the table and it was better.  We will be coming back again to try other items on the menu for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, interesting menu & great complimentary bean dip with chips. It gained a fifth star because I used a Groupon coupon to make it a fantastic deal."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food portions are huge. Great prices. Great service. I like the karaoke nights & live bands performing. They always have deals with Groupon &  yelp. Must try Mexican restaurant. I get the carne asada street tacos almost every time with side of bean and rice. Taste delicious."}
{"text":"What a great place the ceviche and Queso Fundido were spot on.  Ask for the extra hot salsa too.  Thank you For the great lunch."}
{"text":"I really like this place.The food is always good and consistent! Plus the price is right."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch, the Carne Asada Burrito had crunchy pieces of Gristle, the Rice and Beans were cold and the Tamale was overcooked. Service was good but we were disappointed after reading good Yelps."}
{"text":"Went once. Margarita was terrible. Green chile pork was better than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I am not a local, but during the week of Inside Bitcoin: Las Vegas - there was a group of 40-50 people that went here because Jalisco Cantina accepted Bitcoin! Everyone was extremely happy about it.   The food was AMAZING, the Vegetable Fajitas were delicious. Service was phenomenal. Absolutely no complaints.   If you like Mexican food, this place is a MUST.  Happy feasting. Cheers!  === PS - Let them know you want to pay with Bitcoin :)"}
{"text":"3 stars for the service but if you're looking for authentic Mexican it's not here guys..  Basic food.. No flavor..  Had their signature carnitas and it wasn't good"}
{"text":"The food was decent. However the service was a little lacking . We had to ask the manager for refills due to not seeing our server much at all. Don't know if we would go back."}
{"text":"Food was totally uninteresting and service was super slow. I am Caucasian so I can say this is bland white people Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food , wonderful service , so sorry to see this place but it was the best in Las Vegas. We hope they reopen in the new location and we hope the greedy landlords burns in hell"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. 3 to 3 1/2 stars describes this place well. I got the specialty tacos which were ok, the chips and salsa lacked being hot and had no salt."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday because I haf a groupon.  Food was very tasty and flavorful. Had the special which was chicken mole. Service was good and prices very reasonable. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall. The chorizo tacos are amazing. Authentic Mexican food, open 24 hours, pretty inexpensive, what's not to like. Only thing I was disappointed in was the chips and salsa they bring out. Salsa is way to watery and the chips are too oily. But everything else is"}
{"text":"Used the Groupon coupon. Went for the first time. Great friendly service and food ! Have breakfast all day . Clean restaurant .Gave you chips and salsa right off the bat . Will definitely go back when visiting Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, place is very clean. Service is lacking an extra body. 1 person isn't enough. The specials aren't really specials either, only $1 off. However, like I said the food is really good and I enjoyed it. I recommend getting a combination.  Good family dining."}
{"text":"Two tacos with rice and beans is VERY filling! I was pretty hungry and I could only eat one taco. I got the asada and al pastor - both packed full of meat and very flavorful, especially the al pastor. Taco shells themselves are a bit too small tho; you kinda have to use a fork to eat. Comes with pico and guac. Mexican cheese was plentiful and delish on the plate!  Free chips and salsa comes with a chipotle brown and a bean dip - both yum even tho I prefer red salsas.  I ordered a Dos Equis on tap, too, and got a HUGE one in a beverage glass. A beer glass would have been classier, but hey. :)  This place is open 24 hours which is amazing. For the quality and price, I'll definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Did not get drinks until after the meal. Service awful! Food average, never been so disappointed! Do not go to this restaurant unless you want to be turned off and unhappy."}
{"text":"I visit this establishment after midnight most visits. Matt, the weeknight bartender, is awesome. Jalisco Cantina has a full menu 24 hours, and is better than you might expect for a 24 hour bar/restaurant. I recommend the made-to-order guacamole appetizer!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas.. God bless this magical place of carb and tequila heaven.. I have the metabolism of an 85 year old greek women but if I didn't I would eat here 7 days a week. Their salsa may or may not cure cancer. I could eat their salsa on anything.. If my girlfriend was half as great as this places salsa or tacos I would still have a girlfriend.. Oh wait.. Point is Tacos are life and people suck but great tacos always bring a  smile to your face.   Ps their bloody mary is awesome and the night shift weekend bartender enjoys getting people drunk for cheap! (He also has a better hairline then me and is twice my age, Lucky bastard!)"}
{"text":"Some gals from work have been here before and wanted all of us to go here for our last lunch before our winter work break. I'm always up for something new. I wanted to try a few different items so I ordered the 2 Item Combo with a Crunchy Chicken Taco and Shredded Beef Enchilada.  The Wait Staff was great, 4 Star just because one order was incorrect and it took a few extra minutes to pay our bills at the end but otherwise awesome. The free chips, salsa and bean dip were tasty, not \"hot\" but had good flavor, chips were warm and fresh.  Now on to the meal, the Chicken taco was full of meat, the chicken was flavorful and tender, the taco shell was not greasy, but the red sauce on it tasted like marinara sauce, it threw off the taste of the whole thing and it tasted like I was eating at an Italian restaurant. A couple of the other girls got tacos as well and found it to be strange. I ate some of the shredded beef from the enchilada and it was overly salty. The food over all was edible but if your looking for good Mexican food or Mexican food period, I say skip this place.  Prices were pretty equal to most Mexican restaurants. We ordered ahead of time so we had plenty of time to get there, eat and get back to work in an hour. I doubt I'd return to Jalisco since there are plenty of better Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The food was very good, the service was the worst ever!  I ordered Ceviche and I never got it, my wife order two chicken taquitos dry nothing on them and Chicken taco no lettuce - cheese only and they messed it up and then the food runner acted like she should take the messed up order.   When we got the bill the food server told us she took care of the bill that is correct.  When I look through the bill, the server double charged us for the combination plate chicken taco and two taquitos.   Very disappointed there is 67 Mexican restrains in a 13 mile ratios.  We have a lot of other options next time.  They have lots of food servers and food runners, just not a lot of service going on, never got a refill on the salsa and had to ask for water and ice tea refills .  We live in green valley, if they are still open in a couple months, might give it a try AGIAN!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be going back to this place! The food is authentic Mexican..... or as authentic as you can find in Las Vegas. The ambiance was nice.... food amazing!! Our waitress was Maria M and she was so friendly and attentive! I would defiantly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, their chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. The ceviche was fresh. Also tried the carnitas tacos and they were amazing! All of these items were on the happy hour menu so the bill was affordable.  Not to mention the house margaritas!!! Good place will def come back again. Lastly the bar tender Omar was super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This location has changed hands several times since I have lived in Vegas. Most recently it was Super Mex. Upon stumbling on a deal on groupon, I decided to check it out while running errands in the vicinity.  Our server was very sweet and attentive. She immediately got us chips and their delicious salsa while she took our drink order. I opted for the house margarita which I was pleased to see came with a shot of orange liquor on the side as if I ordered a Cadillac. I'm not complaining! Although not traditional, my eye stumbled upon a chicken bacon burrito which I couldn't say no too! It was delicious but the service was almost too good as the chips were immediately refilled and I ate too many so I was already full by the time my extremely generous sized burrito arrived. Lucky for me I love leftovers!  On a side note, the have a decent sized bar with a big screen tv. Looked like a great spot to have happy hour or catch a ball game!"}
{"text":"Went here for late lunch on a Sunday. Service was great and food was pretty good! We received chips, salsa and beans....and we both ordered the taco salad for $11.50. The salad was fresh and tasted really good! Shredded chicken had right amount of spicy. We will be back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I order carnitas and FRESH guacamole to go, which is more expensive. The carnitas were OK however, the guacamole was not made fresh as it was already turning into a dark green color, and it tasted EXACTLY the same as the one that came with my food. I think tricking customers is not the way to go. Thus, the bad review."}
{"text":"I have this place another try after the manager or owner messaged me. This place is still dirty. The food gave two people in my party sickness. The staff washed windows instead of refilling our drinks. I didn't see them wash their hands before handling food. The service was also slow. The worst service and food around. Not to mention the rat poop I saw the time before that...."}
{"text":"Came back due to an invitation from management. Decided to order the exact same thing as last time. It was significantly better this go around. Mom said her chimichanga was better as well. They've reeled me back in and I will be back more often. This is great news because I love the atmosphere and intimate setting.   I have to say that I still miss Super Mex (Sorry management. This is not your fault.). But I am getting over the fact that they're gone and Jalisco is now here instead. But, I can say that I took my Mom to Lindo Michoacan today for Father's Day and we both agreed that the food there still wasn't as good as it is here as Jalisco Cantina. Oh and the manager here insisted that the grilled veggie burrito wasn't on the Super Mex menu, but I beg to differ. It was, I ordered it often and it was amazing every time that I did."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place!!!! Never have I had anything that wasn't above my expectations..the only reason I didn't give five stars is because their service situation is a bit odd. It always feels like there is only one server on the floor, so service can be slow...but the food is so good I don't care!"}
{"text":"We came for the Tuesday night blues so cannot comment on the food. The waitress was understanding and still brought out chips, salsa and bean dip, all good. We ordered house wine which was a bit pricey but a cut above so worth it. The band is worth the half hour drive. Non-smoking restaurant environment for blues. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. We will return, next tine saving our appetites for late dinner."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by this place. Came here with a friend who raved about it and wasn't sure how it would stack up. The service was super quick, friendly and efficient. To start they give you chips, salsa and beans. What an awesome idea. I love dipping chips in my beans with my entree. They got extra points for that.   Their margaritas looked awesome but sadly I was sick and couldn't experience one for myself. Will def go back to try one out next time.  For my meal I got the chicken enchiladas and man were they delicious. The red sauce was homemade, chicken was top quality and just enough of everything to melt in my mouth. They were cool about me getting double beans and no rice. Extra points for that. Very nice size portion too-for 8 bucks I was full.   Overall had an awesome experience here. Great food, great service and I will be back for another amazing experience."}
{"text":"The hostess was a sweetheart and seated us very quickly. The bathrooms were fairly clean. The waitress hated her job, you could just tell, she wasn't terrible, I mean she served our needs and all, but she certainly didn't feing joy in doing it. It was a big turn iff to the place honestly. We got our drinks, one of which was a Margarita, it tasted like it had no alcohol in it at all. I rarely drink, so if I have a strong drink it will effect me very quickly, I drank the majority of it in an empty stomach and felt nothing, I don't think there was even a full shot in there.  The food came, presentation wasn't great, but whatever,  it's Mexican food so no biggy. The food was very good, I'd say a step above robertos, but a step below chapalas. Prices were high for food, it was almost  $13 for a burrito.  I was glad we had the groupon ti save us a little money. The margarita was surprisingly cheap at $5.95, but I would much rather pay $8.95 and have some liquor in it honestly. Husband played a few bucks in the machine in the bar and said the bartender was keeping busy but didn't have too good of customer service either. The manager appeared to be running around in a poor mood with an upset look on his face which may explain the poor attitude of the staff, with the exception of the hostess who was great, but just before we left he was over there messing with her about something and pointing around tge restaurant while he complained that she didn't seat someone fast enough, so I'm sure it won't be long til she's got the same attitude as the rest of them. Probably won't go back, I'd rather pay half the price at robertos and get the same level of customer service, or pay the same price or less at chapalas and get amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! I'm a picky foodie so when I say something is good it's great! The steak fajitas, ceviche and top shelf margaritas (only $8 and they're huge) are excellent quality! Free Blues Band LIVE on Tuesday and Saturday."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Had the carne asada burrito and it was excellent..The meat had a char broiled flavor. The habanero sauce is also to die for. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Simply put this is quality Mexican food at really good prices. The menu is large. Service is always great. Off the beaten path but worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is now our spot, it is now our third time dinning here and well each time is better and better.  First the chips, beans, and salsa that they bring out to start are amazing!  We usually come with a party of four or more today it was six and we decided it was great the last three times it was now time to bring my mom and dad (very picky mexicans lol)  We ordered 2 Green smothered burritos that were perfectly seasoned and sauced. Asada quesadilla that was so dank I truly tried to finish but was so big I could only get half down. Combo plate with 2 tacos ground beef; 1 hard 1 soft they were I quote \"the best seasoned ground beef tacos, I am shocked I liked them so much!\". Another combo plate with chili relleno, asada enchilada, and a shrimp soft taco, you just cant go wrong with any of the food we tried. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. Enchilada with asada we just had to try since they dont usally go hand in hand and were surprisingly good but the asada is still the money ticket. Relleno was great and not soggy like some places.... beware this makes for a very hot plate. Lol Our 6 person was smart he knew the portions are big so he got to try everyones.  Over all my family was very happy with the quality of the food and service oh and my Dad said the music is legit too. Oh and my Mom said this place is so much better than all the \"LINDO\" places around town. Lol We will be back for the delicioso food.  This is a must try spot!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years, but have noticed the quality and taste of the food has gone down. The waitresses are still friendly, but it takes a really long time to eat there due to the restaurant's skeleton crew. (The tamales have no meat in them, just FYI) The place is still welcoming and comfortable."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Jalisco since it was SuperMex, making the trek to the south east side for several years. We are usually armed with an easy to find coupon saving around $10-13. Tonight we had the seafood enchiladas and the chimichangas, Uriel had the carne while I had the ground beef.  Every thing looked and tasted great as usual. Of course we always eat our fare share of chips and fantastic spicy salsa. Since it is made fresh daily sometime the jalapenos are a little spicy. The hotter the better. We have always found the service to be top notch here and rarely have any complaints."}
{"text":"Jalisco, I'm sorry, but we need to break up. It isn't me. It's you. 100% you.  Last night, the wife and I went to Jalisco for dinner. We were seated quickly enough. The chips and salsa were brought right out. We even had our drink order taken quickly. Our server, Esmerelda, appeared shortly thereafter and took our order.   My order: 3 Combination plate - Cheese enchilada, Shredded Chicken Enchilada, Shredded Chicken Crunchy Taco and all rice, no beans.  30 minutes later, Esmerelda stops by the table and asks us if we would like dessert. Ummm, I would prefer dinner first. She had a look of confusion flash across her face, glanced at the kitchen, the fear of realizing she had left our food in the window for who knows how long flashed next, before she said our food would be right out.  Imagine that, 30 seconds later, our plates were brought out. My \"crunchy\" taco was soggy, fell apart the moment I lifted it up. The kicker? Shredded beef, not chicken. Ok, I'll eat the rest, while we wait for her to check on us. First enchilada I dove into, also shredded beef. Seriously guys? 30 minutes and you send out poorly made, wrong food?  Finally, Esmerelda stops back by, we show her how everything was wrong with my food. She says they'll get me the right food out right away.  While waiting for that food to arrive, I give the cheese enchilada a try. What could they do wrong with that, you ask? Somehow, the cheese was chewy. Not standard cheesy deliciousness chewy, but did they put some gum, or old tire in the cheese chewy.   After a much shorter than 30 minute wait, a plate with a chicken enchilada, actual crunchy taco, rice and beans was delivered to the table. By then, I was a little over the entire experience and tired of chewing, after consuming the cheese enchilada.  The last two items were decent, not good, but decent.   Needless to say, Jalisco is not on my list of places to eat again. Ever.   This happened on a Thursday evening, they had maybe 3 other tables when we got there, no big rush leaving or entering at any time when we were there, so it wasn't like we got lost in the shuffle.   Also, having a Yelp logo asking for reviews on the menu is bad form. May want to double check the Terms of Service on Yelp before you do your next run of menus. I didn't notice it until the server was picking up our menus, else I'd have photo'd it."}
{"text":"Food awful.  Service even more atrocious.  This place should be avoided at all costs unless you're just there to get drunk and play video poker. Our friend had her wedding reception dinner here.  It was a small party only 10 people and everything was wrong from start to finish.  They lost half of our orders and started bringing everyone's food out.  Had to take our orders again.  Then everyone got their food except me.  Took an hour and then they got my order wrong... Again! Wow.  2 hour hosted beer and wine and all of us only got ONE beer.   Water glasses empty for days.  The dessert was awful too.  How do you screw up fried ice cream?!?"}
{"text":"Non pretentious Mexican restaurant. Great food for the price. Came here when it was Super Mex and I will continue to dine here. Service is great and very nice."}
{"text":"If you need good Mexican food for a good price come the staff is amazing it's really a place I've been going for 15 years now the carne asada is amazing and the pollo adobado are my favorite and it's what I order each time I go and of course for dessert a fried ice cream can't go home without it no meal is complete unless you have a great dessert."}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant and was hesitant to try it because I'm picky about Mexican food (from Texas and Tex-Mex is my favorite food group) and the yelp reviews weren't overwhelmingly positive. However, about 3 months ago my mom was in town and we were tired and wanted to eat something quick so we decided to finally give Jalisco's a whirl.   Place wasn't very crowded and service was attentive and good.   The salsa and bean dip they serve with chips is good.   We ordered guacamole as an app and it was blech. I did not enjoy their guac. The avocados did not taste fresh. My favorite guac is the simplest & freshest and theirs has huge chunks of onion and tomato and was watery. Just say no!  I got a combo plate with a hard shell ground beef taco and cheese enchilada. Both, including the rice and beans, were very tasty. Whatever cheese they use in enchilada is bomb. The red sauce is good too. Thumbs up.  I got an agave marg on the rocks and it was so sweet I couldn't drink it. Next time I would skip the agave--maybe I just don't like agave.  My mom got a chile relleno and she said it was really good.  Since this first visit, I've ordered take out twice on nights I didn't feel like cooking and you just pick up from their bar. Definitely worth giving this place a try if you are craving Mexican and in the mood for a low key lunch or dinner. BUT, skip the guac & agave.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place?  The complimentary chips and salsa/bean dip are delicious.  Everything I've tried on the menu has been great (I've been here about 6 times and have gotten different things each time). Food is better than many Mexican places in Las Vegas that charge twice as much.  The prices are very reasonable and we've never had to wait to be seated.   Ambiance is a little lacking, but this is more of a weeknight place for us when want something tasty and cheapish."}
{"text":"I preferred this place much more when it was SuperMex. I don't know what other changes were made when it became Jalisco's but IMO it has gone downhill. The menu is a lot different. The carne asada nachos my son always gets is no longer the same dish. They now use a different white cheese that tastes so waxy and cheap. People who have eaten cheap cheese know what I mean! My former go-to meal was the steak fajitas. At $12.99 it used to be so tasty and portion was large enough to bring home another meal. I think the same item is $15.99 now. Smaller portion and not as good of flavor as the original. My son and I both agree the steak meat they use for the nachos and fajitas just suck!  I gave them one more chance when I dined in for breakfast and ordered the chorizo and huevos quesadilla. Honestly, it tasted like I made it at home. I'm definitely a doggie bag person but I wasn't inclined to eat the other half of my quesadilla anytime soon.   The plus side is the chips and salsa. I'm glad they finally changed from whole fried tortilla rounds to triangular chips."}
{"text":"Oh yes this was good. 5 stars don't come for free from me. First time coming here very happy very good.  Got 22oz Dos xx for 5.95 delicious tap. Mexican shrimp crema pizza, Fantastic! Tons of fresh peppers, cheesy. Shared a 3 item combo plate. Cheese enchilada , so far the BEST I have had. and I am not joking I have had many enchiladas all over Vegas. This one was thick, not overly sauced, the cheese was like an Armenian stripper thick but firm and creamy. Oh my so gooooood Other item was carne asada crisp taco, meat was very good, nice helping of fresh guacamole. Other item was pork tamale, white corn garlic meat filling.  None of the meat was related in any of the dishes,nothing makes me more disappointed than eating the same shredded crap thats in the taco is in the tamale, and the burrito. NOT the case here!! Everything seems to be made different. Special flavors for each. With a reasonable price.   Im going back, and telling people.  YUM."}
{"text":"I dined here with a group of 20 people on Saturday night at 6:30pm. The place was full, and we had to wait about 40 minutes for an earlier group to depart and for them to re-set up our tables. Once seated, it took a bit of time to get the waters and chips out, but soon they were taking orders and bringing out heaping plates of Mexican goodness.   Bonus points for Christy (I hope I got that name right) who did an excellent job organizing the tables, and getting the food out. She did a nice job handling everything for the group.   The food was delicious, I had the same 2 street tacos I had before and they tasted as good or better. I heard plenty of compliments for the food around the table too, only one person wasn't too happy with their taco salad.  So my upgraded review adds another star for the great service and good food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Vegas/Henderson!! They have tons of coupons in the Entertainment book and they do Groupons so it makes it even better!! Love the creamy chipotle sauce on EVERYTHING!!! Yummmy!!!"}
{"text":"We had a bartender named Karla! I haven't seen her in a long time and it was great to come back in and see her. She's always been on top of service when there's a full bar! The food is great and such an awesome happy hour! Great pricing and yummy margaritas! Try out their chicken taquitios and tacos Tijuana!!! They got a fabulous NFL happy hr!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mini Chimichanga  is very filling. Fresh taco was very good as well. They make good pico, salad and chip."}
{"text":"My brother and I are foodies. Always trying new places.   We decided to come check it out as it has a good rating.  It was our first time here today, February 15, 2017.   Pros: Prices are very affordable. Value Menu has good options. $7-$9  Regular menu is affordable $8+  Customer Service is nothing outstanding but it is good.   Cons: The reason it is 2 star: Food is very bland. No taste whatsoever.  Very average. Full plate portions to fill you up? Yes.  But to leave you cleaning the plate & happy belly? No.   Honest review: Is it a restaurant we would consider coming back to? No."}
{"text":"Omar is by far thee best bartender waiter busboy manager etc HAHAH OMAR IS THE FACE JALISCO !!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived near Jalisco for 2 years and LOVE Mexican food yet have never had the desire to try the restaurant because the sign is ugly and uninviting!! My husband however knowing my love for Mexican food decide to take me there for a date! I've now been to Jalisco twice and have been sooo impressed with the environment, service and food!! I have greatly enjoyed my experiences!!!"}
{"text":"All the familiar deliciousness of Super Mex...with a new name. Still my favorite Mexican food in Vegas! Also, the change in the tortilla chips is a welcome one!"}
{"text":"They have the best guacamole. An incredible menu, with an awesome value menu. I love eating here."}
{"text":"I love the place, I just don't like the way our rice smelled when it came out of the kitchen. It smelled like the used the microwave. Other than that the meat was delicious!"}
{"text":"After two visits here I can now attest to the consistent excellence of this place for fine authentic Mexican cuisine.  Here, besides an addictive mild, mellow, and very tasty Bean Dip that is presented with homemade Salsa and warm tortilla chips, fresh guacamole is made three ways, two of which I have sampled.  Maiz Y Chipotle Guacamole features green avocado and large yellow kernels of corn, and is adorned with twisted Fried Onion Straws.  It packs a powerful spicy backbite that put my mouth on fire after downing just a few scoops.  While I liked it, I found much milder and chunkier Guacamole Classico, with avocado, tomato, onion, and cilantro, to be cold,  refreshing, and more to my liking.  Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp with a bit of melted Monterey Jack Cheese was excellent and succulent, with or without Adobo Sauce.  Coming eight to an order, and served with cucumber and tomato slices, and half a lime, this porcine app easily serves two diners, which Diane and I learned after initially ordering two platefuls.  This was just one of several leftovers that came home with us the first time, to serve as a great lunch the next day.  For a main dish I savored both a Casero Burrito Carnitas and a very nice Casero Burrito Verde, in addition to a very good Shredded Beef Crispy Taco just for a change of taste.   Diane had Chicken Mini-Chimichangas with the chicken marinated in a Chipotle Sauce, and a mild, well-melted Cheese Quesadilla filled with shrimp.     Both times Janeth was a friendly, attentive, and very competent server.  On the first occasion, Diane's appetizer plate was chipped.  But everything was in order on the second visit.  To add to Jalisco Cantina's allure, free Nevada Poker League tournament play is hosted here on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Because Diane and I had greatly liked the South of the Border fare served up by Jalisco at its former location on the southwest side of the Las Vegas Valley, and the menu appeared to be about the same, we and another couple ventured east to partake in Jalisco's vaunted Mexican food at its newest location--and we were rewarded for our efforts with a nice reprise of what we had previously experienced.  The ambiance here features wood furniture and is fittingly reminiscent of a Mexican cantina.  Right out of the gate we were served complimentary Tortilla Chips accompanied by a tasty homemade salsa and addictive mild Bean Dip.  As an extra app, I ordered Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp for the table, which is  a crunchy delicacy here.  Diane enjoyed hers plain, while I accepted the bacon-enrobed shrimps the way they are normally cooked here--covered in rich and dark mole.  For mains, I selected a plump and filling Casero Burrito Chile Verde covered with melted cheese and Verde Sauce, accompanied by a homemade Crispy Shredded Beef Taco.  Both were delicious.  And the Cheese Quesadilla filled with shrimp ordered by Diane oozed with gooey yellow melted cheese and bristled with tender camarons.  There is surely no scrimping on major ingredients here!  Service by our waiter Jareth was excellent, and we were treated warmly by the manager and all staffers even though we were not familiar to them.  We hope to become so in the near future whenever we are craving fine authentic Mexican cuisine.  XXXX-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"No wonder the other location close down this one is next you have a menu on Facebook but on the one of the restaurants different of course more expensive portions seems smaller Margarita didn't taste that good the bartender was trying his best"}
{"text":"This review is a bit late, however still important as I want my disappointed voice heard.   I was left stunned and in shock when we rolled into the parking lot and noticed it was no longer SuperMex in which we had eaten at religiously over the last 7 years.  We decided to go in and see what the hell had happened. Ok so the staff informed us that Jalisco still has the same Owner and that they only changed the name. They also stated that there were only \"minor\" \"simple\" changes made. As Maury stated \"THAT WAS A LIE\"   Yeah this was a big let down, I knew there was more than just a name change that had taken place. The décor was different, the menu was different and the complimentary chips and dip was different. This was getting more disappointing by the minute as we dined.  The plates are smaller, the prices have increased, the items that we had enjoyed over the last 7 years were no longer existent. I am disappointed in so many ways that I don't know where to begin. The only thing I know is that I will not be back :("}
{"text":"Have to say I wasn't impressed here. Walking into the place a little early for Dinner but there was only one other table seated. It should have alerted me to the disappointment that was coming. As we sat only two other tables came in and both of them were Senior Citizen aged groups.   I mention that only because as we were eating our food it reminded me of the food I ate at the nursing homes my grandmother lived at as a teenager. Very bland and not overly flavorful.  I was given three small soft taco shells for my shrimp fajitas. With all the peppers, onions, guacamole and cheese on the plate you could have easily used 6 to 9 more shells. The shrimp were incredibly overcooked and lacked flavor.   The Fiance had a taco dish that was also very bland in flavor. We had to order extra Guacamole and Salsa just to add flavor to the food.   The waitress had a total of four tables while we were there and we still only saw her three times. Once to take or order, once to deliver and finally to give us a bill. Never checked on us to ensure we were ok and I had to Flag her down to request my extra shells and get our bill.   I don't recommend the place but if you like mild almost bland food you just may love it."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for lunch today.  The bartender Rafael was one of the best bartenders I have ever had.  He was extremely attentive and knowledgeable not only on the menu but the drinks as well.  My wife ordered the enchilada and I had the chicken tacos.  Both were cooked to perfection.  We will definitely come back as it's rare to have both phenomenonal service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Normal such a great place.   Ordered 3 meals all came out at different times with the kids meal last.  Her fries tasted liked cooked in very old oil.   I'll give them another shot but tonight not their best effort. And you'd think they'd take kids meal off bill or some offer but nothing"}
{"text":"I've always looked at this place while driving along Pecos, and finally dropped in with a girlfriend to have a drink and bite to eat. We opted for the bar side, and although it was pretty mellow when we got there, it was Friday and didn't take long to liven up. We sat at the bar, and almost immediately received a basket of complimentary chips and 3 dips. They were all ah-mazing (especially the bean dip), and at that point all I needed was a margarita and it'd be perfection. We both had the top shelf margarita first, and substituted fruit juice with agave nectar. It was good, but I needed the extra oomph and asked for a double...don't judge me, just keep reading. We ordered the spicy margarita next, despite the bartender's warnings. Well, only after she gave us a shot of the habanero infused tequila for taste purposes, and we proved to her by shooting it that it wouldn't be too hot for us. LOL! My friend also ordered the shrimp pacifico, which I wasn't a fan of simply because it was sweet. I don't know what it is, but for me fruit slaws and tacos just don't go. The entire time we were there service was great, despite the fact she was the only one there and had about 20 customers. Shout out to you Gretchen, you rock!! Overall, everything was great and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars if they had better chips BUT their food is great them accommodate our vegetarian needs. The place is clean. I have dined in both the bar and restaurant area and both rock. The ElPatron is SO GREAT!"}
