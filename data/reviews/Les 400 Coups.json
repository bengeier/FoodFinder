We easily made a reservation for lunch through Opentable as we usually do. Lunch reservations are much easier to grab than dinner! When hubby has the time, I tend to grab the opportunity to try restaurants during lunch time: easier to grab reservations, more affordable prices, but still very delicious food!

Prior to arriving, we were originally opting for the à la carte menu as we thought that was the only menu available. But no, we were greeted to a prix fixé after we were seated! As I looked around the restaurant after ordering, it was very chic and beautifully decorated. Tourists, business professionals, locals like us were all having lunch (probably the prix-fixe) and overall it had a quiet atmosphere.

3 courses for less than $30! When it is ever that affordable? This is why Montreal is such a great foodie city to be in :). It didn't take very long for hubby and me to change our minds and opt for the prix-fixé; we might come here more often for lunch now that we know! The à la carte is of course still available.

We skipped drinks as it was lunch time and just ordered sparkling water to share. After complimentary bread was brought and it was oh so delicious! I didn't feel the need to butter my bread that day because it tasted better without it in my opinion. Wish I had some right now!

My first course was more or less vegetarian, although I didn't intend to. I was very delighted with how the dish was presented - so pretty! The beautiful plating was kept all throughout our lunch and in my opinion, got better with each dish. I found the appetizer very refreshing and light, just how I wanted. It definitely doesn't fill you up but there are more courses coming your way anyway. Overall, it was a great Summer dish (I visited before Labour Day)!

My husband's main dish was extremely delicious! It was extremely well cooked and presented. The yogurt sauce complimented the sausage very well and overall, the dish was enjoyable; however, the portion of the dish seemed a little small.

Lastly, our dessert. Hubby didn't order one (so opted for the 2-course) while I chose to have dessert (3-course). The honey panna cotta I had was incredible! With the strawberry sorbet and sablé breton, it was a sweet party in my mouth. Everything was so incredibly well balanced and overall not too sweet which I really liked. Again, beautiful plating and personally, some of the panna cotta I've ever had!

Overall, our celebratory lunch at Les 400 Coups was very enjoyable. The prix-fixé menu was definitely a plus, as we were able to enjoy a great course lunch at a much affordable price point. The restaurant did not disappoint; every dish was not hurried, well prepared, and as the consumer, we could easily feel how much the chefs cares about their cuisine. Read more about them here - you'd be amazed at how dedicated and passionate they are about their work! Whether you're a student, business professional, a local, or a tourist, Les 400 Coups is for you! I truly recommend the restaurant as it is one of the best in Montreal (see their Press tab!) in one of the hottest areas of the city. Reservations are definitely recommended, especially if you're looking into going to the restaurant for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends, plates were decent, appealing and original. Service was good and nice. A drink was also offered to us too. Taste of the multiple different plates we took tho was deceiving and for the amount we spent not at par with other places in Montreal I tried this summer ie: Hvar, Le filet... Too bad, likely will not return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my girlfriend, and both times were amazing. This is as good as dining out gets in Montreal.

First time was about a year and a half ago, so I don't remember a lot of detail. We both had the 5-course tasting menu, which is what it sounds like: 5 small courses, chosen by the chef, delivered in a steady trickle over a couple of hours. Everything was impeccable and delicious. My girlfriend splurged and got the accompanying wines: again, small servings chosen by the chef to go with the food. I'm not a wine drinker, but she raves about it to this day.

We went again last week. Started by sharing the liver mousse appetizer, which was a plateful of itsy-bitsy little gems, like liver mousse (of course), cubes of gin jelly, slices of parsnip, and blueberry sauce. Absolutely amazing. For mains, I had rabbit and she had suckling pork, both were delicious. Again, both plates featured several ingredients, carefully chosen and beautifully presented and, most importantly, delicious. Likewise with dessert.

Les 400 Coups is really the textbook fancy French restaurant: impeccable service, beautiful presentation, small servings, high prices, and absolutely tons of flavour. Not somewhere you'd go every week unless you're made of money, but worth the occasional splurge."}
{"text":"Amazing, the food was on par with Michelin starred restaurants in Europe. Wine list was fantastic and service was warm and friendly. One of the best places I've eaten in Canada."}
{"text":"...would've liked to go 4-and-a-half stars here, but I can't give it 5 because I felt our waiter was a little aloof with us.  When he poured our wine, there were droplets running down the bottle...seems picky but was a bit annoying.

As for the food, it was delicious...my sweetbreads may have been a bit salty, but they were crunchy on the outside and \"marshmallowy\" on the inside.

The appetizer was amazing also...

A definite recommendation!!"}
{"text":"I disclose that I do not have an especially refined palate, and it seems foodies are nuts about this place, but I didn't really get it. The food was delicious, the service impeccable, classy atmosphere, and super-knowledgable bartender to pair drinks with the food. But when I leave a restaurant hungry and sober after dropping $100, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Montreal! The decor is cool, the staff is not pretentious and super helful...and the desserts, especially the lichy, are amazing!!!!I
The menu changes all the time but you won't be disappointed!
If you are in Montreal, you should not miss it!!!"}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago, after they just opened.

my friend knows the chef and we had gone to Newtown when he used to work there last year. We really liked Newtown and had the nicest surprise, so naturally we wanted to try this out.

I guess the name of the restaurant is a play on the address and an obvious reference to the new wave french movie from Francois Truffaut.

I really like the chefs here, Marc-André Jetté chef, and Patrice Demers pastry chef, they have a very fresh take on food and are very passionate about what they make.

The place is dark and subdued, the ambiance is very trendy, but relaxed and not austere. The staff is warm and always smiling.

after dinner we went and peeked into the kitchen, and it was very clean, I saw this beaker with boiling water inside, reminded me of old chemistry lab... anyhow anyone can see the kitchen since the door has a glass insert so you can see them work in the kitchen.

Onto the food,

 we had the mackerel, the butternut squash tartlet, and the lamb shank. all three are mains, because we opted to have an extra main instead of an entrée.

The mackerel consisted on a grilled piece of mackerel laid on 3 duck ravioli in a broth and some purée of parsnip. This was our entrée substitute, it was light and somewhat of an experiment in contrasting textures. My friend liked the idea, i didn't it was a weird dish that didn't harmonize well, even though each element was well executed. I was disapointed...

The other two mains that we had were quite exquisite!!!

The lamb was exceptional, cooked to perfection, and the taste was sooo good, good sauce and good sides. My friend does not like to eat meat, but she wolfed it down in no time...

The butternut squash tartlet was very original, and tasted amazing. sautéed mushrooms, butternut squash mash, some greens, mixed up and garnished with pie crust pieces. it was kind of a deconstruction of a tartlet but it looked great and tasted great.

On to dessert

we had the pot de creme, of course, because it's the pastry chef's signature dish, and the yuzu cream.

The pot de creme is as always, amazing, smooth and creamy, just sweet enough and the hint of salt just rounds it out. This dessert is evil, you will want to order another one, and we were tempted by the waiter but successfully resisted because it is obviously all fat!!!! but it is really really good.

the yuzu was blah, first of all i don't like yuzu, and came out as this rectangular cubic log, which was a tangy sort of gelled custard  some meringue crackers and basil garnish. I don't like tangy, and I didn't like this, but my friend liked it... 

all in all, we had two superb mains and an awesome dessert, that was very good dinner"}
{"text":"This one gave me some trouble - I think it's a decent place but gets lost in the million other bistros in this city. 

There's nothing wrong with it, in the sense that it ticks all the right boxes - the decor is classy, airy, and modern with tall ceilings. The location is romantic (old port), and they serve tasty, albeit marginally creative small dishes at the usual high prices. 

The problem is, there is nothing really offbeat or quirky about it, kind of in the same way a Lexus is a good sensible all-rounder but ultimately not really desirable. Petoncle tartare, a piece of nondescript white fish with a confit of some sort on top. The fact that I can't remember what exactly I had says something about the impact.

At the end of the meal , picking my teeth with a toothpick, I was thinking to myself \"Nice place, but Deux Singes was better.\""}
{"text":"* entrée de steak tartare: 
Pas relevé ( ne m'a pas été offert) et même légèrement sucré!!! Ils y mettent du Ketchup!! Sacrilège!!!!!!
Crème glacée aux anchois....une trouvaille, mais goûte à peine ce qu'il annonce. 
Bons légumes d'accompagnements frits

Pain ordinaire, mais ok.

* plat principal hareng: 

sauté bonne croute, trop salé.
légumes d'accompagnements basilic? frits ( mauvaise huile, arachide?) trop gras, huileux, lourd.  Légume purée, navet? Rabiole? Insipide, fade.

* Évidement, on s'est rattrapé sur les desserts: Vert ( son nom) pomme rapée
Jus de lime, cardamomme, chocolat blanc....je monte au ciel!!! Mais je ne suis pas très dessert, j'aime mieux bien manger et m'en passer...çà insulte mon intelligence, c'est trop facile de décevoir tous le long du repas et de faire un gros Flash-sucre à la fin....TA-DAAAA!"}
{"text":"This place is not for everyone, but it is a special dining experience! It can be very pricey, but is worth it. The serving sizes are small and meant to share, but are presented so beautifully and in such a way that makes great sense to your palate. You choose 3-4 dishes per person. The cocktails were lovely and the sommelier seemed very knowledgeable and chose wonderful accompaniments for each \"course.\"  All in all, a fantastic meal/experience that I hope we can recreate again."}
{"text":"Have heard about this restaurant and had really high expectations going in which usually sets you up for a fall, but this really is a great place. We had a group of four, all tried different choices and everything was just amazing. I even tried a taste of Sweetbreads from my partner (don't ask what that is, just order) and it was excellent. 

The ambiance was lovely and service very friendly. Also, I've found lately the restaurants I've been going to in Montreal are very loud, but even full you could still hear the people at your table (which is a good thing ;) ). Overall, loved this place. The restaurant is fairly packed though, so reserve earlier in the week for a weekend table. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I found the portions small with a weird taste not what I like , I had great expectations and was disappointed , very limited menu with very small portions that even my cat eats more on condition  it has a good taste ! The salad of cucumber is made of only 1 cucumber and a small drop of goat cheese and the fish I took tastes different with a green unknown  sauce  but other than that the ambience is good and the service is good but you will be sure that you will eat lots of bread and butter there!"}
{"text":"My dinner companion and I were both very pleased with our respective dinners; the service was good, the wine selection appropriate, and each of the items in our respective 3-course menu nicely crafted (the cardamone vanilla ice cream was superb) . Great attention to details. The setting and atmosphere makes this place suitable for business dinners, dates and food lovers."}
{"text":"This place is expensive with just ok service

pre-dinner martinis were sadly watered down- very unusual for a posh resto.

appetizers- tried the liver mouse, tartar, and scallops.  Liver mouse was a smaller serving than usual and accompanied by a salad of sorts and was good.  Beef tartar was highly seasoned (not my taste) and had this mustard ice cream that was kind of silly.  Scallops were extremely poor value for money (maybe 10 very small ones) in a soupy broth. Not recommended. 

Mains were ok- we tried gnochetti with lamb and veal sweetbreads.  Pasta dish had so much dill and herb that you couldn't taste anything else- sweetbreads dish was served with kamut and squash broth scented with fennel and was extremely sweet and almost desertlike. In the end I quite enjoyed it with the wine but it is definite not for everyone. 

In all it is an expensive place with ok food but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"3 course lunch menu for 28$.  

Better than the meal we had for dinner at Maison Boulard for 4times the cost. Amazing."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out on a recent trip back home. We were unable to get resos for Garde Manger but were happy to try Les Coups. They were rated one of the top 10 new restos in Canada by enRoute, along with Toronto's Campagnolo, so I figured they knew what they were talking about. Not surprisingly, of these top 10 newbies, MTL held three spots. 

I'm not sure what time the place closes but it was a Thursday night which was unnaturally dead in MTL. It may have been the horrible weather (rained like crazy), but when we arrived for our 10:30pm reso, all but two small tables were occupied in the dimly-lit space, located in Old Montreal. The decor was alright, a lot of dark colours, huge walls covered in images of a typical Paris neighbourhood, loved the ceilings...apart from that, nothing crazy. It may have been the time of day but I found service among some of the servers could have been a little less blah. But it's all good, it wasn't as though they were being offensive or rude. One younger woman with dark hair was especially nice.

There was a decent selection of dishes to choose from that evening. I started with the whipped goat cheese which was delicious and light-tasting, with clean flavours to whet the appetite. I didn't think it would be as substantial as it was but I was happy with the long curly slivers of cucumbers enveloping almond pieces, with a dab of honey jelly among the little balls of whipped cheese, and a couple of thinly-sliced grapes, which combined, would equal about 1/3 of a whole grape(what's up with that?). This dish, while not using the most expensive of ingredients, was clearly a laborious one to make and at $12, was well priced. My friend ordered the scallops which seemed more like a ceviche as it was almost raw. I don't remember how it was described on the menu (definitely not seared) but there was some warm creme fraiche-type deal on it (it was actually some kind of mild sauce of sorts) with black caviar strewn about the plate. I imagine the caviar was intended more for presentation or even texture, but it wasn't very flavourful and lacked any real texture as it bloated from cooking in the warmth of the sauce. The baguette they provided was terrible (surprising) and rock-hard--could be that it was the end of day but not a big deal as I wasn't there for the bread.

Next up, I had the wild bass--one of my fave fishes. Also a hit. Good sized slab of fish, perfectly crisped skin and edges, with maitake mushrooms and white asparagus. The vegs were SO TASTY, like they'd been seared with a really fatty rib steak. MMMMMM! My friend's beef short ribs were supposedly cooked for 72 hours, which I believe. I don't even know how they could have plated the thing without it crumbling into a million pieces as it was SO incredibly tender! So good it was, surrounded by what I think were hearts of palm and a lot of beets--some really pretty ones that were red, white, and spirally. I don't remember what type they were, only that they were of a Japanese variety. Both mains were excellent.

Les Coups' pastry/dessert? chef is one celebrated Patrice Demers so it didn't make sense not to have dessert! I had the panna cotta which featured a quenelle-shaped \"piece\" of ice cream, some hand-torn spice cake that was spiced just right, pumpkin seeds, and other little details which escape me right now. It was OK, but not the orgasm I was expecting. My friend's pot-de-creme was the typical caramel pudding concoction with salted toffee you see a lot these days. That too was alright, but again, nothing special. (I say Campagnolo's version is way better.) We were probably the only ones in the restaurant who didn't order any wine so I can't say much for their selection, but we did order a few cocktails and drinks which were generous on the alcohol. ;)

All in all, we were happy with our meal that night at Les 400 Coups--definitely worth checking out if you like contemporary French food, or merely curious. I noticed on their website they have a prix fixe lunch menu. I've no idea what portion sizes are like then but they sound like a pretty good deal if you've got more than an hour to spare over a lingering lunch."}
{"text":"Easiest 5 stars I've given. Everything was very very good. Ambiance was chic but comfortable. Service was swift and attentive (more so than other places we experienced in Canada - more a U.S. Style)
The adjacent table had the tasting menu with wine pairing which I kind of wish we had gone fire winced everything was so good

We started with the liver mousse which was incredible, and the smoked trout which was also very good (could have been a little more smoked for my liking). 
Main course was the suckling pig (super tender with just enough of a sweet hint from the maple - not too sweet) and the duck - perfectly medium rare 
We had the rhubarb sorbet and the coffee pecan tart. Both were good clean finales to dinner but a little over priced in my opinion. 

This is a Montreal top pick place. Great focus on good with strong service."}
{"text":"Was there for a work dinner and we had the entire restaurant. Wait staff were very attentive and food was excellent. Cater well to allergies and dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I don't know how or why this place got into En Route's Best of 2011; there is nothing to set their food or ambiance apart from all the other bistros in the city, most of which are far superior and far less expensive. Service was snooty, careless and pretentious. We booked a table but were seated at the bar; this, in spite of a half empty restaurant! Food was absolutely nothing special. The funny thing is, I had the exact same meal at another restaurant that was also on En Route's Best of 2011 list - Les Comptoirs - for almost 1/3 the price, though with 100% more flavour. Avoid this place. Not worth it in a city with so much more to offer,"}
{"text":"This restaurant is indeed closed, although you can still get online reservations (as we discovered to our dismay earlier tonight). We were fortunate to get a table for 4 around the corner at the last minute. The staff at that restaurant came over from 400 Coups once their paychecks started bouncing. Looks like this place's run is over."}
{"text":"I went to Les 400 Coups for a gorgeously relaxing dinner during incredibly hectic Christmas time. Being wrapped up in all the shopping and celebration, I didn't have time to write a review. Time took its toll and now, almost two months later, I have to admit that I forgot many of the dishes' details.

But hey, this restaurant definitely deserves a post, so here's an overview of the 400 Coups tasting menu and my dining experience. And anyways, did you reeeeally want to read a ridiculously long post describing the particulars of 7 dishes, one by one? Exactly, so you're welcome.

For $65, the tasting menu is totally worth it. From the amuse-bouches to the starters to the mains to the desserts, everything was all delicious. 

For sure, this is one of Montreal's best new restaurants. The dishes are not exceedingly experimental but deliver interesting and delectable mixes of flavours, with each ingredient prepared and cooked to perfection. Actually, the only dish that didn't have me raving was the scallop plate - the scallops were slightly undercooked. Even the desserts were out of this world, quite literally. Have you ever tasted a pannacotta made with mushrooms that grow on maple tree bark and gain a syrupy flavour from the sap? Or a dessert made of litchi granita, thick and creamy white chocolate yogurt, grapefruit in Campari and hibiscus flowers? Floral, light, creamy, slightly bitter and refreshing, it was the most delicious dessert I've ever had. In the world. Ever.

Les 400 Coups is a serious restaurant for mature diners - waiters know their menus and wines and provide phenomenal service, the décor is impressive without pulling the typical \"rustic-chic-with-a-chalkboard\" bit, and the room is modern with tall ceilings. The atmosphere is relatively quiet and allows for comfortable conversation.  Actually, it's a little too quiet and \"well-behaved\" for my taste - the music was low and the lights could be dimmed just a little bit more to induce an atmosphere that encourages nighttime hedonism. But really, that's just nit-picking. This is a foodie must-try.

{"text":"It may have taken 400 tries but they certainly got it right this time. Les 400 Coups is definitely amoung the best restaurants in town. I had lunch there last Friday, note that they are only open for lunch on Friday's,  and I can't wait till my next opportunity to eat here.  

The service, atmosphere and food was second to none and all for a price of $28 for a 3 course lunch.

I started with the salmon gravlax that was very good, but not mind blowing (that comes in a second). For my main course I had the shrimp gnocchi served with an outstanding lobster bisque and fennel and for desert I had the Chocolate 'Pot-De-Crème' which was totally amazing! 

I ordered the gnocchi on the recommendation of our waiter and was thrilled with the decision.  Every bite of it was perfect . As for dessert, the dish presented in a Mason jar looks great and tastes better. One of the best desserts I've had in a while! Each flavour jumps out at you as you eat it. The dish is made with Maldon salt, which to tell you the truth I had never heard of before, but you feel as if you can taste every single grain of it against the sweetness of the other ingredients. This dessert is definitely mind blowing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner on a Friday evening.  We were lucky to get a reservation just a few hours in advance, though for a late dinner. The staff was friendly and the waitress helped us our way through the French only menu (we are anglophones). We ordered The carrot soup and sturgeon fish sausage for appetizers. They were both excellent; carrot soup wasn't too sweet, yet with enough carrot flavor. Fish sausage was quite unique and fishy. We ordered Arctic char and catfish for mains. I highly recommend the catfish - very fresh and with nice sauce. Our dessert was rhubarb sorbet. Overall, a great experience! It's on the expensive side, but has an amazing value; we impressed with the amount of food and quality and didn't feel ripped off after :)."}
{"text":"This was one of the most expertly prepared meals that I have ever had- drinks were inventive and tasty- however, be aware that this is a limited menu with small, but perfectly prepared, portions- more like tapas. So, if you like large portions, this might not be the best choice for you-however, I was with 2 twenty year old men and they were satisfied with the portions- mostly because the food was so tasty!menu changes regularly- so probably not helpful to describe particular dishes... if you like great food in an energetic atmosphere, this restaurant is a must!"}
{"text":"was really impressed with Les 400 Coups. We enjoyed the tasting menu with wine parings - 105pp. Coming from Toronto this seems a great deal on a very expertly prepared menu. Oyster amuse, raw shimp in asparagus milk, beautifully prepared cod with fava beans and fiddleheads, duck magret perfectly cooked. Most dishes elaborated with interesting sauces and powders. Fabulous 3 part dessert. Attentive service was slightly inconsistent - some lengthy waits and wines/food arriving at different times. Great sommelier, well chosen pairings. A really nice evening."}
{"text":"Came here for the 3 services for 35$. We had the buttersquash soup which was excellent, the fish which was crispy and delicious and the desert that I wasn't a fan of. I wasn't super full but was confortable after the meal. 

The place is located near metro champ de mars. It's not big, but the place is nice and clean. The staff was friendly and the service was quick."}
{"text":"J'y suis retournée pour mon anniversaire, l'équipe a changé, on pouvait le percevoir dans les plats. J'ai adorée ma truite en entrée et mon plat de pâtes mais mon dessert n'éclatait pas en bouche comme la dernière fois. La présentation de certain plat laissait a désirer dont le homard a mon conjoint. Je vais y retourner certes mais pas comme étant un de mes indispensables. Or je tiens a préciser nouvelle équipe alors adaptation et c'est normal, 400 Coups demeure un excellent choix"}
{"text":"Portions were substandard to say the least. Chef is trying so hard to make original tastings he seems to forget what works and what doesn't. Dessert of butterscotch mushrooms icecream and wafer is a total disaster. The bill which  was close to $300 is a joke. Try Wendy's instead!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife both had the tasting menu. I had the vegetarian version of it.

Overall impression: Lots of potential but fell short in the flavor department on 2 out of 5 dishes.

I started with a beet salad amuse-bouche. This one was excellent.. full of flavor and layers, great presentation. I normally don't even like beets but this dish, I loved.

The appetizer was a cucumber with goat cheese salad, with grape slices and nuts. The presentation was once again was beautiful but the taste fell a bit short. I am not a goat cheese fan to begin with so perhaps some people would love it. I felt like the dish needed something like lemon or herbs to add more layers to the flavors which were overpowered by the strong goat cheese.

The entree was a turnip \"pasta\" bowl with parmesan and trumpet mushrooms/puree. Very original dish. It's surprising how well the turnip felt as a spaghetti of sorts. Flavors were strong but very nicely balanced with some lemon. Definitely a winner.

The main meal was the reason I gave Les 400 Coups 3 stars. It was a \"slab\" of butternut squash with some mushrooms/nuts/various greens. The butternut squash itself was amazingly done, it was extremely smooth, buttery and silky. The ingredients around this main piece were all correct and well chosen, however what lacked heavily was flavor. It lacked salt/pepper and perhaps something like lemon/onions/basil/flowers.. something to add more punch to it. It was just very flat tasting and not too interesting. It's really too bad because the potential is there in the dish, it just wasn't executed very well. 

The 2 desserts were exceptional. Some of the best we've had. The \"Vert\" dessert was especially unique and bursting with flavor. I had never tasted white chocolate yogourt with green apple before.. The second dessert was a chocolate mousse with pear sorbet and my wife got a strawberry jelly with sorbet. Both were very very good and given the ingredients I listed I don't need to describe the flavors!

Service was adequate, nothing amazing but fairly good. They didn't take away our wine glasses even though we didn't want wine, which was kinda weird. The waitresses were friendly and attentive to our questions/comments.

My take on Les 400 Coups: We'll check it out again in a year. There's definitely a ton of potential in it. There's a lot of great things about it and like I told my wife: they get it. They just need to work on the vegetarian main dishes more and add more punch and rounded flavors to them. My wife thought her tasting menu (with meat) was excellent. Also the presentation in every dish was great.

I give it 3 stars but I think that it's closer to 3.8 or so.. I just didn't want to give it 4 because they did fall short on the main meal which is a no-no to me. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Thanks to some Yelp friends (JK & WC), I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here - the three course Friday lunch menu at $28 / person. It should be noted that lunch is only served on Friday's and reservations are recommended and required. There wasn't an open table in the place within minutes of the lunch hour.

Service was excellent. I was enthusiastically greeted at the door and brought to my table as I waited for my friends to arrive. No problem for \"out of towner's\" - the staff all spoke English and they had English versions of the menu. Although the restaurant was packed, dishes were brought out at a reasonable pace.

The restaurant itself looks great, very modern with dark coolers, wood tables and a large mural on one wall. A fairly large bar area runs down the other side of the restaurant. You get a view into the kitchen at the back and the large open windows at the front provide natural lighting. The only complaint I had was the tables that were so close together and the place gets loud as conversation fills the room.

On to the food...    

My first course was a delicious beet salad that included Bresaola (tastes and looks like prosciutto), beets and radish. It also also had a sprinkling of pickled mustard seeds which added a nice flavor punch. 

My main course was the homemade gnocchetti with carrots, confit guinea fowl, mushrooms and arugula. I loved this dish. The gnocchetti was cooked perfectly, the guinea fowl extremely tender and a wonderful overall flavor profile.   

My last course was the Chocolate \"pot-de-creme\" with caramel & salt. It's served in a unique jar presentation. The ingredients were layered one on top of the other. This dish wasn't my favourite but I'm not really a sweats person. 

They have some local Quebec beer selections and full wine / cocktail menu. I appreciated the mix of beers available.

I will back for sure on my next trip to Montreal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here.  We tried the mussels, duck, pork, and halibut dishes. They were all delicious. The staff was also super friendly. Worth checking it out if you are in old port."}
{"text":"We just returned last night for our third meal here. Needless to say, it's quite good.  We were hungry when we arrived last night and selected our dishes from the small menu. We placed our order and asked to speak to the sommelier for wine suggestions. We selected our wine, and as she went off to get our bottle, our starters arrived. I don't know if it was because we were eating so late (10 pm), but the timing of the meal was a bit off to start. 

The wine arrived in short order and we tucked in to our first course: the lobster with crispy chicken skin, and the beef tartare. The lobster was delicious---perfectly cooked, plump bites, topped with a sprinkling of crispy chicken skin and a sabayon. There was some cumin in there somewhere, which was surprising and not altogether welcome, but overall the dish was very good. The beef tartare, I'm afraid, was grisly. The flavours were okay, but the texture was not. After the first course, we asked that they slow down the pace of the meal, and they happily complied. The service is good here--attentive and efficient. 

Next, we received the main courses: Scallops with french beans and wild mushrooms in a buttery lobster bisque with curry (Indian spices again, but it worked better here). The scallops were sweet and tender. Excellent. My companion had the veal sweetbreads, which he loves and orders whenever they are on the menu, anywhere. They came in a tasty yuzu sauce. He likes his sweetbreads to be really crisp, and there were portions that he didn't eat, but overall, he enjoyed the dish.        

One thing that is always perfect at Les 400 Coups? THE DESSERTS. Do not, under any circumstances, skip dessert here.  It is wonderful. We had \"The Green\"---yogurt, apple, pistachio, olive oil....you get the picture. Totally interesting, fresh and delicious. We also had the vanilla cardamom mousse---also good (but if it's your first time, get the chocolate pot-de-creme---it's awesome). 

All in all, a good meal. I would have given another half star if Yelp allowed it."}
{"text":"Situated on a cobblestoned street.  Totally transported me to another time and place.  Super romantic, the rain that evening added to the allure.

Spring for the 5 course tasting menu.  Simply divine and a steal at $75/pp. Their wine pairing is $45/pp, generous pours, as in FOUR FULL glasses. Never see that, ever!

Seating: if you're a party of two, request the window nook, good for people watching and maximum privacy.  

C1: Gazpacho, seasoned beautifully, great texture and the perfect amount of cream
C2: Crudo, loved all the accompaniments, kept the palate piqued
C3: Pasta, homemade, al dente, briney from the uni and buttery rich
C4: Rabbit, 3 ways, all tender, the addition of the freshly picked peas were wonderful
C5: Cheese/Predessert/Dessert: ALL fantastic

Improvement: open BOTH bathrooms for the patrons, the restaurant was packed and people were waiting, some giving up, not great for our bladders

Modern cuisine, fresh and textural elements throughout.  Beautiful but also excellent food.  Superior service.  Highly recommend and would return on my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here based on a friend's recommendation. It's a very nice, cozy place. Sat at the bar and the bartender was super nice and knowledgable about the menu. I asked if I could order a drink off the menu and he said yes but when I asked for a French 75 he told me they didn't have any simple syrup. What kind of bar doesn't have simple syrup?! Ended up ordering wine and it was fine. 

The food: had the veal tartare as appetizer and it was different, slightly sweet but very good. Ordered the linguini with mussels and chicken skin for main. Again, different but tasty. Dessert was pecan tart. But what's up with the portions? They only use half the plate in every dish! For these prices, I expected bigger portions. You shouldn't leave a restaurant after paying almost $100 still hungry!"}
{"text":"I went to Les 400 Coups in November last year and I loved it. I finally remembered to write about this classy place. I went there on a date for dinner on a Friday and it was a memorable experience. This place was quiet, trendy and professional. The chef had a limited menu with their speciality dishes and I ended up having duck ravioli and it was awesome. Usually I dont dig duck but this was not gamy at all and flavourful. I had white wine and my friend had haddock which had a great creamy sauce. I wish I remembered the details but I will be back for sure. I highly recommend it.. only if you enjoy high cuisine since it is portion controlled!"}
{"text":"Very good 2 or 3 course lunch menu on Friday.

Well prepared and presented food. Good service and drinks as well.

Clean interior."}
{"text":"Les 400 Coups gave us the food experience of our lives. We're not globe-trotting foodies, but I don't think we're total naïfs either. 

The servers were genuine and friendly, and helped us, a pair of Wisconsinites, feel as though we weren't out of our element, though we clearly were. The cocktails were the best we found during our five nights in Montreal, and the wine pairings were perfect. 

The tasting menu would have been worth it at twice the price. The veal ravioli (paired with an oaky white) and the \"little poultries\" with sausage (paired with a bright red from southern Burgundy) are among the best dishes I've eaten. The desserts were unreasonably good, notably the lemon custard with strawberry sorbet (paired with a white wine that tasted strongly of honey).

We have never before eaten at a restaurant that cared so much about the experience of its guests. If you are visiting Montreal, and you love food, and you can afford the tasting menu with the wine pairing, then imagine me shaking you by the lapels and urging you to go."}
{"text":"Everything we tried here was great. We stayed at Montreal for just a week, but we went there twice for both dinner and lunch. Great service. They are open only two days for lunch. Definitely try the Arctic char. White onion soup was divine. Smoked salmon appetizer was delicious. Sturgeon was great as well. Dessert was not bad, but not memorable. We regretted we did not get their tasting menu. Definitely great value. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Location: In old town. The closest subway is Champ-de-Mars and it's a 5-minute walk from there. Street parking is available [metered] but finding a spot is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Public transit is the better option.

I precede my standard review format with one word: Impeccable. 

The place: Not huge by any means, but the space is cozy and comfortable and reminds me of an urban chalet. I really liked the overall vibe of L4C and any place that plays Johnny Cash and Leonard Cohen is rocking in my books. 

The goods: Well, first of all, I'm still stuffed this morning, so that should say something, right? 

Starters: I'm not much of a meat eater. I know - I say this often. But I do like to be adventurous from time to time, so I decided to go with the Boudin Blanc, served with Kohlrabi, tarragon, and raspberry. Sweet baby Jesus, was this good OR WHAT? No, it wasn't - it was great. Unlike your standard Boudin, L4C's version is made with fowl and thus, the texture is a little softer and more delicate than the blood variety. It reminded me of Cretons, actually, but with a milder flavor. It was so totally delicious that I wish I could chow down on this again this morning. My date ordered the White Onion Soup [smoked sturgeon, elderberry, sorrel]. This soup is unlike any onion soup that you've ever had because a) there's no bread, b) there's no onions and c) there's no fromage. Rather, it's a creamy kinda soup. I loved this - the sturgeon was a really interesting flavor to combine with the soup and really brought everything together. If you order either of these starters, your belly will thank you. Fantastic.

Mains: I opted for the Yellow Sturgeon, served with naked oats, carrot, Brussel sprouts, veal jus with smoked herring, savory. First off, the dish was beautifully presented (well, they all were). I hadn't tried Sturgeon before which is why I selected this fish over the Arctic Char. Sturgeon is pretty meaty so don't let the fact that it's 'just fish' fool you into thinking this is going to be a light option. It's not. I quite enjoyed this, and the veal jus with smoked herring really complimented this fish. It was delicious. Now, there weren't actually any Brussel sprouts on my plate - only leaves, so I guess maybe they were going with a deconstructed theme? In any case, another amazing dish. My date had the Suckling Pig, served with celeriac puree, cherry, radish, sweet gale jus.  I forgot to take a photo of this one, but the presentation was wonderful. She loved every bite of her dish and she wiped it clean before the server came over to take her plate away. So much so, that he laughingly commented on this. 

Dessert: It shouldn't surprise anyone that I went with the chocolate option, right? Didn't think so. I ordered the Kalingo Dark Chocolate & Peanut dessert, served with a Concorde grape sorbet and pear. Another stunning presentation, and HELLO - once you combined the chocolate mouse with the peanut powder, your mouth found itself filled with the gourmet version of a Reese PB cup. The chocolate was amazing - not at all rich or too sweet.  My date opted for more wine over dessert. Tant pis/ touch sh*t for her!

Service: I can't say enough about the spectacular service that we received here. Honestly, when I walked in and saw that all of the waiters were bearded and sporting plaid shirts, my immediate thought was \"GREAT. I've walked into Hipster central. How the hell did this happen?\" This myth however, was quickly dispelled as soon as the host greeted me in a friendly fashion and with a huge welcoming smile. Relief. Our main waiter for the night was the fabulously awesome Guillaume. Not only was he the friendliest waiter to ever sport a beard and plaid shirt, he was also extremely attentive and knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu. He guided us through the menu and answered all of our questions with no hesitation, his knowledge of wine made me wonder if he worked at a vineyard in his former life, and more importantly, he made every effort to accommodate my date, who is unfortunately plagued with Celiac disease. L4C is very gluten-free friendly and have no qualms about modifying most of the dishes on the menu. On a more general note, our water glasses were refilled continuously, our table was cleared immediately between dishes and well, service rocks. 

Price point: One glass of wine + appy + main + dessert will run you about $75 plus tax. 

Make a reservation - these guys pack a full house on weekends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal and looking for a great restaurant -- we couldn't have done any better! The menu was one of the most creative I've ever seen, service was excellent, and ambiance was wonderful (cool decor, dim and candlelit). The Atlantic char was our favorite. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ce resto a une très grande réputation, et ça se comprend!
Situé dans le vieux port, le resto a une devanture noire assez chic de l'extérieur, et nous garde dans une ambiance tamisée à l'intérieur
Le service est excellent, les tables sont bien agencées, de sorte qu'on ne soit pas les uns sur les autres, le bruit ambiant n'est pas trop élevé, le menu donne vraiment envie (j'ai eu du mal à choisir!!) et les différentes assiettes sont toutes plus délicieuses les unes que les autres! Saveurs uniques garanties!
Possibilité de choisir/vous faire conseiller de très bons vins également
Parfait pour une soirée en amoureux ou entre amis, en petit comité idéalement!
Seul petit hic: le prix, qui bien sûr, est celui d'un cinq étoiles... Personnellement, je ne pourrai pas me le permettre tous les jours!"}
{"text":"Wow! Went there for lunch and was blown away by how good the food was: healthy, original, delicious and decently priced. I wish I'd lived closer to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. You can the taste the chef's passion. The petit pot chocolat was to die for.

 Make a reservation so you dont get frustrated of not getting a a table."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, comfortable atmosphere. Love the open kitchen where you can see the chefs at work. The waiters are very helpful and the service is attentive but not overbearing. 
The chefs here produce some artful and excellently executed dishes that are locally sourced. 
The seared scallops were done just right. The duck leg was very tender and juicy with delightful flavors that come together on the plate. The Arctic char was crisped on the skin, while the flesh sat in a comforting layer of broth that warmed the palate. 
Well done."}
{"text":"One of my wife's favourite restaurants. Have enjoyed more than one meal here and always satisfied with a creative menu and excellent service."}
{"text":"Spent an interesting Valentine's Day here. I live down the street so I though a few gin martinis on an empty stomach before dinner would be a great idea :) my wife was not impressed lol. 
It was a fixed menu and the food was very good, like great quality, all of it! The only thing is that I dropped $350 on that dinner and couldn't help thinking that is a lot of money, and I do $100-$200 dinners frequently! So in the end you can get same excellent quality food elsewhere for less! We had the fixed menu and 2 mixed drinks each!"}
{"text":"During one of the coldest days of winter, we made our way to this well-regarded restaurant located in Old Montreal. Only one other couple was there when we arrived for our early-evening reservation; it did fill up by the time we left. The restaurant featured banquette seating along the wall, some tables facing the kitchen, a sizable bar, and some tables lined up in the center. The tin ceiling, iron scrollwork, tall windows, exposed brickwork, and photographic mural all provided interesting design elements in this space.

We had already decided on the five-course tasting menu, even though the menu that evening listed many tempting items. Like tapas and dim sum, tasting menus allow us to enjoy a few bites of several dishes. With tasting menus, each of those dishes is coordinated to showcase, in this case, local ingredients and the skills of the kitchen. 

We started with Îles de la Madeleine oyster shooters, the salty-sweet meat tasted clean.

Next up, we enjoyed an incredible mushroom, cauliflower, and caramelized onion combination, served on a pancake-like galette. I was so impressed by the creativity and taste of this dish and consequently, thought this was the best dish of the evening, in an evening of superb cooking.

The next dish included langoustine cooked in the shell and served with a braised and then crusted pork belly. Again, I was impressed by this different interpretation of surf and turf.

A meaty duck course followed, medium rare, with whipped foie mousse on a crouton, a variety of mushrooms, and potato gratin in a berry sauce. Each bite was different and delicious. I was so glad to see duck in this course, and thrilled by the unique preparation and presentation.

The dessert course repeated the creative consistency of the past four: honeycrisp apples with honey, shortbread and an apple chip. The ice cream had a tangy-sweet flavor, akin to yogurt, instead of an ice cream.

Service was good, professional and courteous.

I highly recommend this fantastic restaurant, specifically the innovative, reasonably-priced, tasting menu."}
{"text":"everything was exceptional. we were a group of 7 and all of us ordered the tasting menu.  they even customized the tasting menu for the ones with food restrictions.  again, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Nous y avons été pour fêter un anniversaire... ça a été super !!
De l'entrée, au dessert, notre palais a été victime d'explosions de saveurs... un bonheur ! Nous nous sommes très bien fait conseiller pour le vin qui a accompagné à merveille nos plats.
Au passage : je suis une très grande adepte du salé, mais là, les desserts sont exquis !
Merci aux commentaires Yelp précédents : c'est ainsi que nous l'avons découvert et nous avons vraiment été très agréablement surpris !!"}
{"text":"Modern French meal with unique wine pairing.  The restaurant is cozy and unassuming.  The 5 course tasting menu was quite good - however I did not have 1 course that was exceptional.  For $75 for the 5 courses, I felt this was an appropriate price.  
Would I come back???  If I lived in Montreal, I would -- but if I came back to Montreal I would not make a point of dining here again."}
{"text":"Nous étions 4 et avons partagé tous nos plats.

Entrées: 
- Homard: mélange de goût et de texture, rarement rencontré dans mes expériences culinaires...ça goûte magnifiquement la mer avec un wow.
- Sashimi servi sur craquelin: bon mélange, mais déjà goûté surtout avec la crème sûre. 
- Tomates: frais et estivale. Fait parfaitement le travail.

Plats:
- bison style tataki: beau et bon mélange de goût. Légèrement trop salé.
- ris de veau: Fondant. Crémeux. Riche. Wow
- porcelet: cuisson parfaite. Tendre et se marie très bien avec la salade en accompagnement.
- boeuf: mélange classique salé, croquant et vinaigré, mais très efficace.

Le menu est chère, mais en vaut quand même la peine. Et je dois ajouter que la présentation des assiettes sont magnifiques!"}
{"text":"For our last night in Montreal, we initially had a reservation at one of the best-reviewed (and most expensive) steak houses in town, but after reading some glowing reviews for Les 400 Coups, cancelled that reservation and dined here instead. We are VERY glad that we did.

Beautifully prepared food, ingredients are fresh in every sense of the word, incredible flavors. Even the tea served with dessert is some of the best I've ever had (even when compared to China and Japan). Wonderful service, and at the end of the day, prices are reasonable compared to similar restaurants we'd been to in NYC. I'll let my photos finish up this review."}
{"text":"Lobster appetizer (cider sabayon, celery and crispy chicken skin) was probably one of the top lobster dishes I've had. Suckling pig entree was juicy and tender. Dessert.....wow....lime curd with crispy matcha tea cake, strawberries, vanilla and Thai basil.... It was a riot of tastes and colours, all of which complemented each-other. Trying out the various pairings in your palatte was an experience in itself. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So, ok. I probably woulda' put 4-5 stars, based on the quality of the food. But the waiter just brought the bill and I asked him to put 10% tip on the bill... Pretty standard in Canada... He said how about the usual 15% and then added it and totaled it before I could say a word. And then after printing out the bill he asked, so where you from? I speak fluent French... But with a small accent. So if this is how they treat my kind of tourist imagine your kind of tourist.."}
{"text":"A little to the east of the more touristed area of Old Montreal, the setting is informal and relaxed.  Our waitress spoke English so well we guessed she was raised speaking English - but French was her original language. Very engaging but never intrusive.

Our starters were a white beet soup with confit lemon and bottarga, and their renowned beef tartare with mustard ice cream. The ice cream is dabbed on the tartare - it complements without overwhelming.

Mains were Wagyu beef ravioli,  and scallops and suckling pig with mushrooms. Both left you content.

I've seldom seen a menu with as many appealing choices - hated to pass on the Spanish mackerel, the guinea fowl, the sweetbreads, and the duck.

We got a bottle of Gamay from the Cote Roannais - light but very pleasant (what a Gamay should be).

We finished with coffee and several Quebec cheeses. 

This is a smaller restaurant - one good sized room. Subdued darker atmosphere - one where you can feel at ease dressed formally or informally."}
{"text":"Went here on the last night of a road trip across the US and Canada and had a good but not exceptional dining experience.

The service was friendly and helpful in recommending wine which was great. The menu had a plethora of dining options and we decided to go with the 5 course tasting menu. The space was also aesthetically beautiful and there was a great amount of space between tables so the experience felt extremely intimate.

The offerings were nice and aesthetically beautiful, but VERY small (I left feeling quite hungry) and the second appetizer and main course we're both duck dishes and I'd prefer more variety. 

The first course was a raw scallop in an elderflower yogurt with microgreens and mustard seed surrounded in a ring of burnt juniper bush that was nice and light and a great way to start the meal.

The second course was a handmade duck confit tortellini variant in a nice broth with duck hearts and mushrooms that was the best dish of the night hands down.

The third course was a small piece of duck breast with creme fraiche, microgreens, shaved celery and rhubarb. The duck was slightly overcooked and definitely underseasoned as well. The rhubarb overpowered the duck breast as there was no seasoning on the duck of which to speak and there was a generous portion of rhubarb and not of duck. Really disappointing entree.

The first dessert was a lemon creme with meringue pieces and cantaloupe with melon sorbet. The lemon creme was delicious and was an aesthetically pleasing and well balanced take on lemon meringue pie. The melon sorbet was good independent of the dish but didn't pair exceptionally well with the lemon creme. The cantaloupe pieces on the plate were actually awful. They tasted out of season and really bad. Almost ruined the entire dish.

The second dessert was a coffee mousse over dark chocolate with a Concord grape sorbet and Concord grape coulis that was exceptionally beautiful. The dish tasted great although I thought the sorbet and the coffee mousse were better separately than they were together.

Overall, a beautiful space and beautiful looking dishes allow for a nice venue to share a special meal. HOWEVER, the meal left me very hungry (I ate about 75g of cheese with crackers immediately after the meal) and the entree was genuinely bad and the first dessert was less than stellar with ruinously bad cantaloupe. Maybe the a la carte menu is a lot better, but for the price point I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally got here after being on the radar for a couple of years and we were glad we did!  Les 400 Coups offers sophisticated  contemporary French cuisine in a cool laid back environment, California/ Wolfgang Puck Style. It s a place to try the tasting menu, as we did, to get the full range of the talented kitchen. Everything was artfully presented and explained with out any of the usual pretentiousness you may find at other restaurants that put out such a high quality plates.  Each of the 5 courses representing a good chunk of the total menu, were a flavor bomb. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The standout was the tartar of arctic char   ( u like the rhyme) a beautiful combination of citrusy, flowery flavors, and  fish. A 10 on the rating scale. The desserts of which there were four examples were plated like little works of art with all kinds a great colors, textures and flavors. You should try the wine pairing with the tasting menu they have a lot excellent wines and not totally Franco -centric. they really know there wines and are not cheap on the pours which I have come across at other restaurants. While Les 400  Coups is not cheap at about $100
per person all in. You would pay at least twice as much in other restaurants of this quality, but ,the nice thing is you can come in your jeans and tennis shoes or jacket and tie and still be welcomed and a little bit dazzled without the all the hype."}
{"text":"Les 400 Coups

Butter is perfect temperature.
Great energy in the place and awesome mural on back wall.

Artichoke ouster soup was excellent. Perfect amount of cream with a dollop of whipped butter cream on top

Cod On Chinese artichoke and honey cap mushrooms
Wow!  Cod was flaky and crumbled right off the skin. In a bed of tiny sea shell looking pasta which turns out is Chinese artichoke and offers a delightful crunch to the soft fish. Small bits of bacon are mingled in as well - not overly crisp to not distract but only compliment the fish.  Also a fine small amount of honey cap mushrooms and sauce. Excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine, relaxed, efficient and convivial service. The dishes were delicious, inventive and appropriately sized."}
{"text":"What a great place.  I loved the restaurant.  We did the tasting menu and it was a great experience.  The do love their duck and they did a great job with it.  I also tried duck fudge for the first time and it was super tasty.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because there were not enough vegetables on the tasting menu and the day that I went to the restaurant the air conditioning was broken so it was super hot."}
{"text":"Book in advance because this place is great, the food was incredible and fresh. The service was excellent, the waiters are really helpful and will find the perfect thing for you to order. Definitely a place to check out in MTL. Only thing is portions are really small, so if you're looking to be filled up this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert, hoping to try their infamous Lichee granite....unfortunately, they didn't have it anymore (so please take it off your online menu!). But what we got instead was a delight!  Their feature \"Green\" dessert was refreshingly good (unfortunately I don't remember what was in it, lol - bad yelper).  Also had the Lime Curd - don't be fooled by the 'curd' - this was a 'deconstructed' dessert made of crispy Matcha tea cake, strawberries, vanilla, thai basil.  Put a bit of each on your spoon and you will have the perfect bite with the basil giving it just the right amount of POP!

Accompany this with a nice glass of dessert wine and it's the perfect end to the night.

Ambience is very nice. Cool, hip, classy. Service is accommodating and unpretentious as well."}
{"text":"Let me tell you of the time I fell in love with Montreal. Part 3: Dessert
Planning with my friends for our dream budget Canadian holiday, we looked up dessert bars and stumbled upon Les400Coups' THREE COURSE DESSERT MENU ($18).

The summer evening my two friends and I came in, the host sat us at the open bar because there would be a half hour wait for tables. When the bar tender waited on us, at first we all thought he would judge us as being cheap Americans looking for a small meal... \"who goes to a restaurant just to get dessert??\" But nope, he was friendly and attentive! He described the flow of the three courses - appetizer dessert, main dessert and finale dessert!

We select our three choices and with each course, a server would describe our plates of table spoon size ice cream and other small bits. We take turns scooping up a teaspoon of ice cream and their tiny toppings, among the three of us and.... POW. Big bursts of flavor in a tiny package! Figuring out each flavor felt like being a judge on Top Chef!

Amidst our main dessert, the bartender also kindly informed us that the fruit on our plate amounted to 8 servings worth of vitamin C found in orange juice! I'm going back to Montreal just so I can experience more of their flavors and also build my immune system!"}
{"text":"Wow----we are from one of the world's restaurant capitals---San Francisco, where great food is the norm.  Well, Les 400 Coups is something special and would rank in the best in any world city.  

A beautiful and intimate spot with specially friendly and helpful service, the dishes were to moan about.  We tried a few selections and were consistently overwhelmed by the rich mixture of flavors in every dish.  Not sure how they were able to blend so many unique flavors, but we were thankful to have had the opportunity."}
{"text":"Our second night in Montreal. Second restaurant that we picked out from Eater 38 Montreal. Very cozy place, classic French dish. The wait staff is accommodating and knowledgable. Wine list was great. 
Food: amazing!
The appetizer special (crabs fillet with crab broth and foam) was so delicious! Arctic char was so flavorful, couchon was perfectly cooked, gniochetti ( their version of cavatelli) was so good. To cut the long story short, I highly recommend this place. It's an A+!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is set in a less touristy part of the old port. Decor is more rustic feeling and although the place was packed the noise level was surprisingly low. Very nice wine list with many 'vin natures' to offer as well as imported beer. 
Dishes were creative, show casing a lot of technique in plating and use of molecular gastronomy. Sauces were a bit on the sweeter side using ingredients such as raspberry, yogurt and ketchup. Classic French items were executed well (boudin blanc and rouge, suckling pig), however the fishes could have used more seasoning. 
Overall it was a nice experience especially if the weather is nice as you get to enjoy the atmosphere of the Montreal old port, however for the same price point and decor we preferred Nora Gray."}
{"text":"Unbedingte Empfehlung: sehr kreative Küche, freundlicher, kompetenter und schneller Service, ausgezeichnete Weine!"}
{"text":"Superbe qualité de nourriture et la présentation est aussi hors pair.  Le crabe des neiges est délicieux et le canard l'est tout autant. Le service est également parfait.  Le seul point négatif tant qu'à moi est la grosseur des portions, on s'attend tout de même à les voir légèrement plus grosse."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, staff, food & wine recommendations.

Price (Food) - 4/5 
Price (Wine) 3.5/5 - Could be cheaper, marked up a bit more than I like.

Food - Enjoyed everything on the seasonal menu, some portions were small, so you may want to order a few more plates.

Service - 4.5/5 - Friendly, attentive, accommodating. We did not like the tasting menu so we decided to make out own, staff was more than willing to space out a few apps and entrees to create our own tasting! Waitress even arranged the order to maximize the experience of our wines. In a word, WOW.

Decor - 4/5 Very cool and romantic, if you can, request to sit by the entrance with two large windows to people watch."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Montreal.  Eclectic menu and special taste-- clearly dedicated chef corp..."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have had in many years. Complement and counterpoint. Les 400 Coups's average rating should not suffer because two people couldn't get in the door or because the place has a totally reasonable policy against people just drinking at the bar.

An appetizer of local French beans was fabulous. A terrific flavor combination of smoked bread, extra-vieille Mimolette, and fresh beans.

Sweetbreads were nice and light. Very good accompaniment of spelt and miniature radishes. Even with beurre noisette, it was neither rich nor cloying. 

Pot de crème is often a dessert for small children. This version was, in keeping with the evening's theme, surprisingly light. Rich caramel and salt.

Our server was very nice. He gave a commendable bilingual recitation of the Scotch selection.

We would love to come again. I would be happy to eat there now, at 9:53 AM. I could eat the same things I had last night."}
{"text":"Butthole Surfers on the sound system and Playful new French cuisine?! In love... The prix fix lunch was only $22 and included the most amazing sorrel \"Chip\" with raspberry dust, this small starter plate was a total mouth-gasm and it got better from there: a beet sorrel salad of some sort was light and delicious, I was served bread and butter on the side and couldn't help myself, enjoyed an amazing Arctic chard small plate and was pretty full from there only to go onto my main tortellini mushroom muscle entrée, (rich but Oh so good). I would have opted for the dessert but I couldn't eat another bite. Cocktails were pricey."}
{"text":"Went for my boyfriend's birthday. Great service, even better food. The dishes were quite affordable but the portions were a bit small. Between two people, we ordered 9 dishes to share. We had 2 cocktails to start and they were incredible, best cocktails I've had in a while. We didn't have a chance to try out the desserts, but will definitely come back for them."}
{"text":"Foodie place with small seasonal menu.  Everything very well prepared.  Had interesting flavor combinations, and it does have an excellent (salted) Pot au Creme.

A little noisy, nice ambiance.  Pretty space."}
{"text":"Wow. The food experience was wonderful. Made for a very special and memorable outing. Two of us had the onion soup, Arctic char and duck. We asked for help choosing the perfect bottle of wine and the service we were given was the best. We were celebrating a new job and Les 400 Coups offered exactly the food, drink, service and experience we were looking for. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So casual that you would never imagine that you are at one of the top restaurants in Montreal. Great service, small place but with availability. It's at the Old Montreal area. The food amazing, specially because they use local products and are constantly varying their menu. Presentation was excellent and cocktails, very good too. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town. Do the tasting menu- simply perfect. It's a bit pricey but sooooo worth it. Make sure to reserve in advance!!!"}
{"text":"A gem for higher-end seasonal french inspired food. The chef keeps a small focused menu which allows him to get creative with the dishes. After telling the server that my wife and I are both vegetarian, the chef happily came up with two amazing dishes for us. Inspiration and creativity is evident in every dish, and each bite is an explosive celebration of flavors."}
{"text":"The reviews on this resto is pretty high so for \"Montreal a table\" I gave it a try. I understand that the price is lower so wasn't expecting very good food. The food presentation was good. I find the food taste is average. Service for our table was slow. I think the name of the resto got boost up and they could keep up with the expectation. Probably won't go back but maybe just because I am too picky!"}
{"text":"Rien de moins qu'un 5 étoiles pour notre sublime soirée aux 400 coups! Ça faisait déjà plusieurs années que je voulais m'y rendre pour mon anniversaire, mais sans succès (il faut réserver beaucoup d'avance pour 6-8 personnes un samedi soir!). Cette année, mon copain m'y a emmenée en amoureux le jour même de ma fête, un mercredi (beaucoup plus facile d'avoir une table dans ce contexte!). J'avais de très grandes attentes envers ce resto et je n'ai pas été déçue. En arrivant, nous avons été accompagnés jusqu'à notre jolie table près de la fenêtre. L'équipe était au courant que c'était mon anniversaire alors cette petite attention m'a fait plaisir. Nous avons débuté avec un apéritif: Aperol Spritz pour moi et Le Capitaine pour mon copain. Les 2 cocktails ont parti la soirée du bon pied. Niveau bouffe, nous avons eu beaucoup de difficulté à faire des choix puisque tout avait l'air bon et que j'avais lu sur Yelp des commentaires extrêmement positifs sur chacun d'eux. Tout en regardant le menu, j'ai demandé un amuse-bouche à la serveuse: une huître garnie de pommes vertes et d'autres ingrédients qui ont fait de cette bouchée un véritable délice. Les gourmands que nous sommes avons finalement opté pour le partage de 3 entrées: la soupe à l'oignon, la mousse de foie et le tartare de veau. La soupe à l'oignon était tout simplement DÉLICIEUSE, le meilleur plat de la soirée. Ce n'est pas une soupe à l'oignon traditionnelle avec un bouillon, des croûtons et du fromage. C'est plutôt un genre de potage lisse tellement doux et savoureux et à la fois! Mon copain et moi nous entendons pour dire que c'est LE must. J'ai aussi beaucoup aimé la mousse de foie, servie avec un pain brioché très intéressant. La portion était généreuse pour une entrée, mais jamais trop pour une bonne fourchette comme moi. Le tartare de veau était savoureux et les ingrédients étaient bien balancés. Personnellement, je suis moins fervente des tartares de viande rouge, mais mon copain a beaucoup apprécié. Au niveau des plats principaux, je suis allée avec la joue de porc braisée. La viande était tendre et savoureuse et juste assez caramélisée dans sa sauce. Les accompagnements plus frais et légers venaient balancer les goûts dans l'assiette, je me suis régalée. Mon copain a pris le magret de canard. La viande en tant que telle était savoureuse, mais le fait qu'elle soit enrobée dans du choux nous a assez surpris pour ne pas être certains que ce soit un mix qui nous plaise réellement. Toutefois, dans l'ensemble, le plat était certainement réussi et nous avons une fois de plus vidé les assiettes. Pour accompagner les entrées et les plats, nous avons demandé conseil à la serveuse, qui nous a servi un très bon rouge. En guise de dessert, j'ai opté pour Rhubarbe, accompagné d'un vin dessert suggéré par la serveuse. Je n'ai absolument rien à dire sur l'accord, ni sur chacun des éléments séparément. Je me suis régalée. Mon copain a pris la tartelette chocolat et café. Il a apprécié les saveurs, mais ne s'attendait pas à une présentation déconstruite comme il a reçu. Le dessert en soi n'a aucunement la présentation d'une tartelette, mais tous les éléments y sont. Nous avons terminé la soirée avec des cafés et la serveuse m'a remis un petit gâteau à déguster un autre jour chez moi, pour mon anniversaire. Notre soirée aux 400 coups a été à la hauteur de mes attentes: La nourriture est excellente, les ingrédients sont savoureux et de qualité, le service est très bon et l'ambiance y est très agréable. Il nous en a coûté 345$ (taxes et pourboire généreux inclus) pour 2 cocktails, 1 bouteille de vin, 1 mise en bouche, 3 entrées, 2 plats principaux, 2 desserts, 1 vin dessert, 1 cognac et 1 espresso) et la soirée le valait largement. Je recommande les 400 coups sans hésiter et j'y retournerai certainement!"}
{"text":"Premièrement, le 400 n'est pas un resto qui est dans mes intérêts. Ce que j'ai admiré, c'est la beauté de tous les plats, ils étaient vraiment magnifiques. C'est vraiment trop fancy pour moi 6.5/10"}
{"text":"An absolute gem to be explored. Service was as expected - friendly and welcoming. I loved my creamy and delicate liver mousse. My arctic char from Gaspesie was sitting in a buttery foam and the contrasting sauce made the dish somewhat playful. 

The food was good but the real highlights were the desserts for me. Plated with all the attentions in the world, it was kind of hard to break the masterful culinary canvas that they were. The dessert menu offered such intriguing flavor combinations that I had no choice but to order 3 desserts. Each plate was prized with a glistening quenelle of heaven. Who would've thought that coffee and blueberry would go so well together? 

The food were as good as they looked. Les 400 coups is among my top restaurants in Montreal and it's well worth trying."}
{"text":"YUM! gr8 service, they found us a spot at the bar at 8:30 on a busy Saturday night and it was super cool Jean, the bartender slash sommelier steered us to a tasty Montreal distilled vodka and quick with a witty quip. When I inquired about the variety of green pea tendrils used as garnish on a number of dishes, I expected a reply along the lines of... \"oh yes, those are Little Marvel Pea tendrils\" or \"Oregon Sugar Pod II snap peas\" or \"Mammoth Melting Pea\" a most friendly gentleman came by and went into some detail on the local retired farmer who grows their produce and offered us a tasting of their homemade crab apple marinade. No9w just imagine picking crab apples.... When we kidded him about the Christian name of our squab like in an episode of Portlandia he totally went along with the ribbing and proceeded to give names to all the dead animals we ate. As it turns out, this guy was the head chef, it's his restaurant!!! Very cool of him.

Every dish was excellent, the chocolate cherry dessert was to die for and we savored every morsel. 

We had such a good time I completely forgot to ask about the obvious homage to the Francois Truffaut movie 'The 400 Blows' when they chose the name for this place, perhaps the owner identifies with Antoine!!!

YUM! Run, don't walk to this place"}
{"text":"Les 400 Coups is doing their interpretation of Modern French cuisine with rave fanfare. The interior is a cozy, rustic though somewhat ornate, if that makes sense, looking spot.

We went with the tasting menu which is 5 courses for $75.

The meal started with an amuse bouche of a clam with a nice acidic mignonette. It certainly woke up the taste buds.

Nice, thick, crusty bread was brought to the table with a nice portion of butter. The bread was the perfect contrast of crunchy crust with a nice chewy interior.

The next course was a cucumber salad with lavender, goat cheese and garlic croutons. The acidity of the dressing was toned down by the creaminess of the goat cheese. The cucumbers were nice and crisp.

The next course was linguine with mussels and fried chicken skin. The mussels were nice and plump, but rather on the small side. The pasta was a nice al dente.

The next course was duck with cherry and raw oats. The duck was a perfect medium rare and retained its juiciness and flavor. The cherries added a nice acidic punch, while the oats added a nice chewiness. The watermelon radishes added some textural contrast.

The next course was blood sorrel, dehydrated rhubarb, wild ginger and crushed pistachios. Pairing two tart ingredients with the blood sorrel and rhubarb, along with the medicinal flavor of ginger was kind of off putting to me. Unfortunately, it appears that I forgot to take a picture.

A mango sorbet with mango jelly, lemon curd, coconut meringue and Thai basil was next. The sorbet was fresh tasting, the mango jelly had a little bit of a chew to it. The meringue had a nice coconut bite, while the Thai basil helped to tone down the sweetness.

The final course was concord grape sorbet with chocolate crisps, pecans and brown butter cream. The sorbet had a nice sweetness with a hint of acidity. The chocolate paired nicely with the sorbet. The brown butter had a soft boba texture with a hint of bitterness, and the pecans added a nice textural crunch.

Service was fine throughout the meal. The food was very good, however somewhat too far reaching at times. Portion size is somewhat small for the price, but quality ingredients and excellent cooking is displayed."}
{"text":"We would have given this restaurant a very high rating based on eating there two nights ago as they did a fine job with the mechanics of it. But here is where they really really made a poor decision: Tonight, at 9:15pm we returned to the restaurant to have a glass of wine at the bar. We thought it would be great to end our evening by patronizing a restaurant we'd enjoyed just two nights before. A man (the manager? a server?) said \"No. You have to eat. You can't just have a drink.\" Okay, you say, they were smoking busy, they were closing the doors, they were full. Nope. Nope. And Nope. Multiple empty bar spaces, multiple empty tables. Place wasn't busy at all. Bad decision=bad rating. We won't return. Better luck with future clients."}
{"text":"First memory of this place is that the appetizers were absolutely phenomenal! We had the boudin blanc (a poultry sausage), the white onion soup (my favourite of the three) and the lard liver pate and I highly recommend all of them. For mains,  we had the Arctic char, sturgeon and suckling pig. They were very very good and presentation was beautiful but somehow not as spectacular as the appetizers. The wine we got was also very good but expensive - a $20 wine for $60. But service and food quality and creativity were great so I would not mind going here again!"}

{"text":"Just go to this place. Don't even think about it, don't let a doubt enter your mind. It's just too good to miss.
My Guinea fowl was potentially the greatest piece of meat ever created. Beautiful setting and presentation but not stuffy or fussy. You can't go wrong. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pour ma part, j'y suis allé au diner et au souper. 

Bouffe - Impressionnante ! Des saveurs balancées et pensées, des présentations complètement sublime (voir photos ajoutées), et des desserts juste incroyable. Dans les plats goûtés: la pintade fumé [une profondeur et une intensité de saveurs renversante], des crevettes accompagnées d'une sauce à l'encre de seiche [délicatesse et robustesse agencée dans une harmonie superbe], de canard servi avec 3 formes d'oignon [oignons caramélisés, sèchés, et en cendre], un panna cotta au citron, et bien sur le granité de litchi avec yogourt de chocolat blanc [WOW!].  

Service - Impeccable ! Service de sommelerie professionnel et très sympathique. Bon timing. 
 
Ambiance - Glamour et classy ! Plafond très élevé, grande fenêtre laissant entrée une belle luminosité naturelle, et fenêtre donnant vue à la cuisine [agréable d'observer ce qui se passe en cuisine]. 

Somme toute, A1 ! J'y retournerais n'importe quand. Maintenant au top de ma list :D"}
{"text":"Pardon the writing break... life does in fact get in the way sometimes even when it comes to delicious food!

I was first aware of Les 400 Coups a few years ago when Marc-André Jetté, Patrice Demers and Marie-Josée Beaudoin were running it. While the entire crew has changed since last year, I had heard enough great things about the new group - headlined by Guillaume Cantin, the original Les Chefs winner - that Les 400 coups remained a must-go to me. A couple of my friends were of the same opinion so off we went on a late Thursday night visit very eager and quite hungry.. mostly because a 10 pm reservation will do that to you!

Les 400 Coups visually strikes a nice, relatively understated modern look. The high ceilings create the impression of a larger room than what is truly there. Black embossed ceiling tiles, simple black walls, leather banquettes and dark wood floors create a elegant style but the white marble bar, the wall-sized Parisian street picture on the western wall and the subtle use of brick add some punch to the room. I've heard that noise can be a problem (which makes sense with the high ceilings) but given the day and time of our reservation, it wasn't at all an issue and actually made us more aware of the music - a strange collection for the setting (never thought of the Black Keys as suitable fine dining music) but still enjoyable. We were lucky enough to have the large banquette by the front window which gave us a great spot to relax, enjoy some good wine and get ready for a hopefully great meal.

As a group, we decided to make sure that we tried every item on the special table d'hôte. For the appetizers, that gave us two dishes - a parsnip soup with smoked bison, wild blueberries, mustard and wintergreen as well as a liver pâté with peach, oat crumble, honey jelly and celery. The soup was such a treat - the use of the smoked bison and the tart blueberries meshed well with the earthy parsnip. Texturally smooth and delightful on every spoonful. The pâté was also a great hit. Similar to the soup, there was a great use of ingredients to enhance and contrast the inherently fatty pâté - the sweetness of honey and peaches, the freshness of celery and the crunch of the oats. A wonderful dish through and through - relatively simple but one that showed a great understanding of flavours.

Next up we had the main courses: Brill with buckwheat, cauliflower, cucumber, lettuce cream and wild caraway followed up by Pork cheeks with beets, smoked potatoes, stag horn sumac and dill. Beautiful technical detail here. The brill was cooked perfectly - great sear on the outside but still flaky and moist. The insane things here were the cauliflower \"crumble\" and the lettuce cream. That cream was so rich and flavourful - how exactly they achieved that using lettuce as a base I don't know but dear lord... such a elegant dish across the board.

The pork cheeks were a perfect dish for a cold autumn night. Rich and homely with great execution. Texturally, the cheeks just fell apart beautifully and had a great fatty taste. The beets and smoked potatoes paired well with them - I simply wished there had been more to enjoy! 

We were almost stuffed at this point but there were still desserts to enjoy. First was lemon cream with sunflower, crispy meringue and melon sorbet. Now, I hate melons but I can't argue that it didn't pair beautifully with the lemon cream here. And about that cream..... just wow. Great richness and a nice depth of flavour. The lemon was powerful but not too tart. The meringue added some crunch to the plate and mixed well with the other elements.

The second dessert was a Dark Manjari chocolate tart with peanuts, caramel and concorde grape sorbet. Creamy and smooth tart, the strong chocolate taste was nicely paired with the peanuts, the sweet caramel and the beautiful sorbet. Another strong dish.

Finally, just prior to the check, we receive mini chocolate and almond cakes. Rich and fluffy with that hint of the almond. A subtle but wonderful item to finish off our meal.

I had pretty high expectations for Les 400 Coups and they were met completely. The level of execution and technical proficiency on display was very impressive. Not a single dish disappointed or left a bad impression on us. Every plate was returned completely picked clean... and not just because we were starving due to the late reservation. Add to that a nice atmosphere, a great bottle of wine and excellent service (safe for a slight technology issue at payment time) and we were left with a wonderful evening. I took me a few years to finally get to Les 400 Coups but I can safely say it was worth the wait.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"5 étoiles ça n'arrive pas à tous les jours! Le 5 étoiles est justifié par la qualité de l'expérience que j'ai vécu et ce, à tout les niveaux.  J'ai visité le 400 coups dans le cadre de Mtl à table. Pour 41$ on nous offrait un repas 3 services. Comme nous étions 3 gourmands à table et que la saucisse d'esturgeon qui figurait sur le menu régulier nous intriguait nous avons pris cette première entrée. La saucisse était moelleuse et goûteuse, très bien faite; une entrée tranquille qui se prend bien mais qui ne révolutionne pas la saucisse ni le monde des entrées. Ensuite, dans le menu de l'événement, nous avons eu 2 choix d'entrée soit la soupe à l'oignon blanc qui était vraiment un pur délice; onctueuse, réconfortante et riche, ainsi que la mousse de volaille: entrée copieuse et très riche en saveur. À mon goût la mousse était trop copieuse pour l'entrée surtout qu'elle était servie avec un excellent pain brioché. D'ailleurs, le pain. Le pain servi à notre arrivé était aussi vraiment très bon avec une mie moelleuse et dense. Nous avons appris que tous les pains sont fait sur place, triste pour nous car nous comptions de facto aller à la boulangerie qui les fournie mais un point de plus pour eux! Ensuite en plat principal nous avons eu le barbue sur courge spaghetti et bisque de crabe. Le poisson était encore une fois moelleux, léger et la cuisson était parfaite. Je n'ai pris qu'une bouchée de ce plat mais j'ai trouvé que la bisque était un peu trop présente. Mon plat à moi était la joue de porc braisée. Je ne suis pas une fan de porc habituellement mais laaaaaaa! Que c'était bon! La viande était tendre et légèrement caramélisée. Elle était servie avec une sauce délicieuse et avec des champignons et un genre de compote d'oignon. Un plat costaud et réconfortant. I like, like, like. Pour dessert on nous a servi une tartelette au chocolat noir: c'était bon mais je ne suis pas du type dessert riche et sucrée donc pas mon truc. J'ai pris la mousse au citron et meringue. C'était parfait pour moi: léger, texture super intéressante, mélange parfait entre l'acidité du citron et le sucrée de la meringue. On a aussi très bien bu: Cavas en entrée et un excellent Syrah dont je ne me souviens pas le nom pour moi. Le service était vraiment sympathique. Je trouve que souvent lors d'événement comme Mtl à table on ne reçoit pas la même qualité de bouffe et de service. Pas aux 400 coups. Je n'ai pas sentie qu'ils baissaient les standards pcq nous bénéficions d'un prix promotionnel. Ça pour moi ça démontre que le client est important. Pour finir si vous vous êtes rendu jusqu'ici (!!) le Resto est très beau et l'ambiance est agréable. Genre de Resto où on a le goût de  rester à table longtemps   pour jaser et refaire le monde! J'y retournerai."}
{"text":"J'ai été aux 400 coups 3 fois et ils ne cessent de m'impressionner!  Primo, ce restaurant de Patrice Demers (pâtissier), Marc-André Jetté (chef) et Marie-Josée Beaudoin (sommelière) a été classé dans les 10 meilleurs restaurants au Canada en 2012. Secundo, le service qu'ils offrent est constant et tellement impeccable. Subtil tout en étant présent si on a besoin d'eux, nous n'avons pas manqué une seule fois d'eau, de pain et tous leurs serveurs sont extrêmement courtois et professionels.  Et je vous conseille fortement d'opter pour le menu dégustation.  Un 5 services pour 65$ dans un restaurant d'un tel calibre, ça en vaut vraiment la peine! Ils mettent des efforts incroyables dans le jeu de texture et de couleurs de l'assiette.  Et les desserts! Bon sang! Je n'ai vraiment pas eu une dent sucrée mais Patrice Demers est vraiment un dieu! Si vous avez l'occasion d'essayer le vert, sautez dessus! C'est léger, intense, intriguant, captivant et oh combien délicieux.  Des combinaisons inattendues vous y attendent et vous en sortirez avec le plus grand des sourires, c'est garanti :)"}
{"text":"Industrial vibe, not too noisy, with focus on terrific food.  No dress code, some patrons were very casually dressed.  Really fresh ingredients, tasted like \"summer.\"  We split the asparagus and the tomato appetizers and then the bison tartare and the sweetbreads.  Dessert at our server's recommendation was frozen blueberries with blueberry shortcake and white chocolate ganache and thyme.  Delicious."}
