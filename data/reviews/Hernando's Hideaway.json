{"text":"Since moving back to North America from the UK I try and eat as much Mexican as I can get my limey-little-hands-on.

After years of soggy burritos, stale tacos, and weird combinations of what the British seem to think Mexican food is comprised of, this city is a burrito heaven for me (don't even get me started about my love for San Francisco!)

But wow. Hernando's Hideaway eh...

This was worse then Mexican food in the UK.

And that's pretty bad.

Like seriously rubbish.

The service was friendly and attentive, and my friends who ordered just Margarita's seemed to enjoy them. Maybe it's better for cocktails and deep fried ice cream.

But for a hefty $15 for something that was subpar, especially when there are much better and cheaper Mexican/Burrito places in the city, it really wasn't worth it and I wouldn't go here again unless it was just for drinks."}
{"text":"I am never going back to this place again. Total rip-off. Very bad food and margaritas. You will regret going to this place."}
{"text":"I grew up in San Diego and tried Hernando's in the hopes of finding a good Mexican restaurant away from home.  

The food is definitely not Mexican and it's not even Tex Mex.  My meal was absolutely disgusting AND they gave me food poisoning!!!  The bathroom and I made best friends last night and I'm still not back to normal.  

The rice was stale and rubbery and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave. The beef tacos were full of grease and encased in the type of taco shell you find in a \"taco kit\" at your local supermarket.

Every time I remember those disgusting, grease laden, beef tacos I want to yak.   Save yourselves from a night of toilet torture and don't go to this place."}
{"text":"Please, I beg everyone: DO NOT EAT HERE. I was sick for THREE DAYS after eating from here. I'm very concerned about this place's hygiene, and I cannot stress this enough."}
{"text":"The sign out front says best natchos and margs in town. Order the con pollo natchos and the lime marg., and you won't be disappointed. The guac. was fresh and tasted excellent. The service was so so, but the food is the same quality that we have come to love from mexicali rosas/hernandos/fernandos."}
{"text":"Now called Fernando's Hideaway. The food is tex-mex style, and its decent. Nothing to rave about but it's something different than a chain restaurant. Dinner will hover around 15/plate and drinks are typical city prices.

Decor is tacky, and it is a very casual. Not a bad spot for a quick bite on a weeknight, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I think the closest they've ever gotten to Mexico is Burlington, Ontario.

It's pretty bland but not horrible or anything...it's fine for a date where you're pretty sure you don't want to put too much effort in.

There are better places just to the south on Yonge street."}
{"text":"Is this great Mexican cuisine? Absolutely not, but if you're looking for some decent greasy tex-mex, it offers pretty good value. 

I get the Mexican Flag, which is three enchiladas, one chicken, one beef and one cheese. It comes with three sauces; tomatillo, enchilada sauce and sour cream. It offers a bit of variety and everything is pretty well prepared (for what it is). The portion sizes are quite generous.

It's a good lunch spot since it's never all that busy. The service is friendly, and you don't wait long for your food. The actual restaurant is a basement and it's a little divey, but it's not a bad place to grab lunch with a few of your friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently moved  from the downstairs location at 545 Yonge Street, below Wellesley, to its current street level location at 591 Yonge, in the space previously occupied by SHUSHI Hanna, concurrent with its name change to \"Fernando's\"..  

I had not been in this place in a few years, so decided to take chance on it  and check out the new location.      The restaurant's decor is kitchy and charming, in a run-down sort of way.  What happened next was a series of unfortunate events.   I began by ordering a Margarita that made my mouth pucker because it was so tart  and improperly mixed.  I asked the indifferent waitress to fix it, however her disingenuous reply was simply that the Margaritas are prepared  in bulk every day, -  a \"non reply, reply\".....

The meal I ordered later emerged with the plate at around 350 degrees F ... When I ended up burning myself on the plate and decided to complain, the owner./manager/chef/bouncer invited himself to sit down across from me at my table and proceed give me a gratuitous lecture about how he \"has been doing it this way for 20 years, etc, etc.\"   I was astounded. 

 Everything about this place screams that they are \"phoning it in\" : from the dried out rice they served me,  the meat that was dried out and tough ( like it came out of a can) to the poor quality of the hurried paint job on the walls.. 

Stay away, stay FAR FAR away !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years and have never really been disappointed. When did it change from Hernando's to Fernando's?  I honestly don't expect much from a divey place. It's not real authentic Mexican. But it does hit the spot for lunch.

Service is always attentive and food is served quick. 

I always get the Mexican Flag. Never been disappointed. The fajitas are just so-so, but still better than those other chain restos. Would I recommend this place to friends? Sure. It's good value for your money and a very filling lunch."}
{"text":"went there twice just because it's one of the very few places that has deep friend ice cream in the city... 

didn't really like the ice cream though because they have the mexican variant vs asian I tried before in Montreal... but still fun to try it if you never did. 

what feels strange is that the place is always empty with only 3-4 customers except us (tried saturday and sunday nights)

the staff is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Phoning it in. Eat here if you like microwaved food and meat that's near its use by date."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant a negative star, and ask for my money back. But thank goodness I've had good Mexican food before, or else Mexican food would not be on the foods I want to eat. 

My girlfriend and I decided to have Mexican a few nights ago, and we stumbled upon this place randomly, and it was such a bad experience. We should have turned around, and went out the door when we saw the restaurant pretty much empty besides a family of three.

We took our seats, and decided to be spontaneous, maybe we missed the dinner rush? (who are we kidding, it was bad), but anyways ... my friend decided to go with the chipotle chicken nachos, and I went with the steak quesadilla.  While ordering my friend found out she would have to pay extra for guacamole ($1.75), and sour cream (70 cents) - was slightly turned off by this, since when do customers get charged for sour cream?! I mean if we were ordering EXTRA sour cream, I wouldn't mind. But 70 cents right off the bat? Not a good sign. 

Things just got worse afterwards. Dirty cups, water tasted funny, and the plates they gave us to share our meals were DIRTY. Moving forward, I got my steak quesadilla, and my steak tasted like it came out of a can, you know when you have those Campbell's chunky soup, the beef? EXACT SAME, and the quesadilla was soggy, and greasy. Ugh. Bad bad experience.  My friends nacho wasn't as bad, but pretty gross."}
{"text":"Outdated decor and so-so average food are the highlights of this Tex-Mex location located in downtown Toronto's core area. Please be aware that this site is not a true Mexican restaurant and it's more Tex-Mex in it's menu location. Service is great, but the entire restaurant really requires a renovation and more promotional offers that will make it stick out as a viable restaurant in the area. The fact that it is located in a subterranean retail spot with no natural lighting also takes away points."}
{"text":"The service is good, decor is outdated Mexican, and the food is so/so. 

I ordered their famous American flag. The dish was sloppily prepared, the meat was dry, and I just wanted more flavour. My friends fajitas looked good. 

Won't return."}
{"text":"I usually don't have any issues with this place, but the last time I was there, I was seated then had to wait at least 15 minutes to have my order taken..the place was almost empty..it was early afternoon. 
Other times I have gone and been seated plus my order taken within 5 minutes of being seated. Sometimes they bring a water pitcher to your table, but lately this has been hit or miss. But they normally give you chips and salsa to get your taste buds in gear. Staff very friendly.
I normally get the fajitas (chicken or steak)and the chicken chipotle nachos..I have tried other things such as quesadillas, Southwest penne pasta, and Arroz Con Pollo (to name a few) but always seem to enjoy the nachos and fajitas more..the large (and delicious) nachos are sometimes enough for 2 meals as I want to save room for the equally delicious fajitas, which come to your table in a sizzling skillet. 
All in all I don't go here as much as I used to, but it is my favorite Mexican restaurant (even if its not true Mexican) in Toronto."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were randomly in this neighborhood while visiting Toronto looking for breakfast. The place we originally went to wasn't what we were expecting so we decided to try Fernando's since we were right up the street. This was the best decision we made since being in toronto. I am a HUGE Mexican cuisine  fan and this meal did not disappoint. He got the Chimichangas and I got the Carne Nachos, I got the small portion and it was HUGE and soooo good. His Chimichangas were spicy and tasty as well! They give you a lot of food although they are a little pricey for Mexican in my opinion. We also had double margaritas which were great! I would definitely recommend this place to Mexican food lovers...especially those who love Nachos and Margaritas, as they are \"the best in Toronto\"!! Go check it out, totally worth it! Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"It's now called Fernando's Hideaway but I have been here at least a dozen times over the last 2 years and it's one of my favourite places in the city. I have tried a few dishes but have definitely settled on some favourites that I crave constantly:

Strawberry Daiquiri
Carne Nachos
Ultimate Chimichanga
Deep Fried Ice Cream

The staff is friendly but reserved, the service is always quick, prices are good and servings are large. I'd definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here with a friend. Nachos were great! Tacos and burrito were pretty good. Kind of pricey, but a delicious meal! The service was great, but it was also pretty empty when I went. If you're craving mexican, this place is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I used to live close to this place and am always looking for a good Mexican restaurant.  I checked this place out in the summer, so I took advantage of the patio out front.  I can't remember what was going on, but Front street was closed off for an event so it was fun to people watch.  

The service was alright, nothing special.  While the patio was nice, the decor inside was very cheap looking.  

We tried the Mexican Poutine to start.  It was essentially fries with a soggy pile of mush on top.  No flavour, not that hot, and not very tasty.  For dinner I had the beef enchilada dinner.  The portions were large, but I would have been fine if they were small so I didn't feel like I was wasting so much food, as I didn't eat most of it.  It came with bland Mexican rice and beans.  The enchilada itself wasn't very good.  Very bland as well and the beef was quiet dry.  For the price that we paid I was not impressed.  It was way too expensive and the food was sub-par.  

I would recommend staying away from this place if you're looking for some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"A great little Mexican restaurant this, tucked away near Yonge and Wellesley.  It truly lives up to its name of being a \"hideaway\", found at the bottom of a stairwell leading from the street.  Down you come and into a little nook that boasts some truly great food.

The staff are the usual friendly sort though have an efficiency about them that lead you to believe that they've dealt with many kinds before you arrived.  The décor is telling of a place that serves up decent margaritas and sangria, the tables have vinyl coverings that become apparent of their necessity once you order.  The ingredients are fresh, flavourful, and the food is one of the reasons you'd elect to go here and not to a chain Mexican place.  Fajitas do not fail to impress.

Do take one piece of advice.  Like the basket of bread prior to a meal, don't get roped into trying to fill up on the fresh tortilla chips and salsa that arrive.  They're really tasty, and equally filling."}
{"text":"Looking for someplace to eat with friends when we stumbled across this place and were lured in with $12.99 Sangria pitchers (Thursday special).  Atmosphere is good if a little shabby in spots, generous seat space at ur table (no feeling cramped) and some generic latin music.  Fairly standard mexican fare offered with no particular standout that we could see.  I had the Chicken Chimi with rice, beans and side salad.  Excellent portion sizes (took half my Chimi home) but flavours were mediocre at best.  All the items on my plate tasted too similiar.  The Sangria was excellent as evidenced by our 2nd pitcher.  
Our server was less then impressive.  May have said a dozen words to us over 90min.  The other server (brunnette with some tats) was very outgoing and engaging, joining in a conversation we were having about spliffs vs joints.  Her participation and laughter sold us on giving this place another try in near future. Cost for three entrees, 2 Sangria pitchers and 2 desserts (avoid the churros. Blah) for $95."}
{"text":"This was really really bad - and we are not that picky.  Cost about 160 for an assortment of dishes, some were inedible.  The shrimp in the sizzling sauce - was inedible - abou 8 tiny shrimp in a flour roux, the big burrito was not big and a mess of sauce and rice that had gone bad.  The churros - omg just don't - they are OLD and hard as heck.  The steak quessida was literally a tortilla with soe shredded dry beef and a bit of cheese - the worst - the fajita's - bone dry processed chicken with a whack of onions - this is the worst food we've ever ordered - definitely."}
{"text":"This place used to be great...way back when their nachos were served up at half-price on Sundays. Maybe it was the price that made them taste soooo good but even at full price, their nachos are still above average. 

What I like is that they dont give a heap of nachos...rather it's a nice flat bed where everything gets a litte topping. The plates are more personal serving...not sharing plates (although I suppose you could share it? But why!?) which is great so everyone can get their own type. Make sure you ask for the red/green sauces!

I've tried many items here over the years and i have to agree with other reviews...nothing to write home about. The place is a bit of a cave and the service is friendly at best - but that's part of the charm imo. 

if you do go, tell them to bring back the half-price nachos!!"}
{"text":"Having frequented Hernando's Hideaway many years ago, my husband and I tried the new version today right by my office.

The server (an older gentleman) was friendly enough but complained to us about the patrons at another table. Staff complaining to customers or conducting personal conversations always bugs me, no matter where we are.

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my husband ordered chicken tacos. We received a small basket of chips and salsa which was appreciated.

The food arrived promptly which was a positive. It was, however, visually unappealing - very brown and beige - and had clearly been reheated as the beans had a crust on the surface. The enchilada itself was edible but crusty and dried out at the ends. I make much better Mexican food than this and I'm about as non-Mexican as it gets.

It wasn't the worst lunch I've ever had, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it and won't ever be returning."}
{"text":"Be advised, Hernando's Hideaway is NOT a Mexican restaurant. It's Tex-Mex at best, so if you are looking for an authentic meal you better go somewhere else.

I went at around 10pm on a Saturday night to the Yonge/Wellesley location. My friend and I waited a good 5 minutes to be seated. The atmosphere was depressing. Dimly lit, deserted, and no music playing in the background to cheer things up. I kept waiting for a tumbleweed to pass by.

 We ordered the Nachos con Carne. The busboy who brought the meal had a bad body odor. The nachos looked like they had been left out all day and tasted even worse. I think disgusting would be an appropriate word. They were probably the worst nachos I've ever had in my life.

I only had a few bites and I feel sick for a few hours afterward.

I'd avoid Hernando's at all costs."}
{"text":"I wish I could have reviewed this restaurant based  on the food. My girlfriend and I came to Fernando's after passing on this place many times. Upon entering we were greeted by the server and asked to sit anywhere we wanted. The place at the time was pretty much empty save for a small group and two couples. Granted we had taken at least 5 minutes to order but we had ordered in time to beat a rush of hungry customers as the venue filled up another 5 minutes after we ordered. 20 minutes of waiting for our food turned into contempt as we saw customer after customer order and get their food before we did despite us being there before. We wouldn't have left as 'quick' as we did if not for a small family of 3 across the way receiving their food, having finished their order and receiving their second order while we remained at our booth sipping on our waters having gone through our reading material twice already. The icing on the cake was that as we left the waitress made it a point to come out to us and rudely inform us that our server would have to pay for what we had ordered and that we had to wait because it was busy. Surely for someone who works in customer service one would think that the general principle is first come, first serve, especially in a restaurant. I suppose however that things are done differently in Mexico."}
{"text":"They should really get rid of those dollar store plastic glasses. Annoying and cheap, worst part of the experience.

Food was quite good, though - I was surprised to see the negative reviews. Maybe we were lucky, or caught a new chef just arrived?

Big portions, reasonable prices, friendly and fast service. I liked it.

A typical intentionally cheapish tex-mex - good enough for a \"hideaway\". ;-)"}
