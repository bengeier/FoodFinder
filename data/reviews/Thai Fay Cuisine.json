{"text":"Thai Fay!!
I never knew this place existed until today. My friend told me about this place and recommended me to go. It's a small family owned business in the corner of the plaza.     They offered 2 lunch combos. Either a chicken pad thai or green/red curry with rice. Both came with a sweet and sour soup, spring roll and a mango salad. I ordered the pad thai and it was really good. The sweet and sour soup not so much, but the mango salad and spring roll was good.
Service was friendly.
Great place for lunch.
I will be bak."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, always fresh and hot when we do take out. Spring rolls are awesome. We go every other week ."}
{"text":"After being disappointed by Thai restaurants in the area, we decided to give this place a try. I have to say it was amazing and the ingredients tasted fresh. The lady who owns this place, Fay, was very attentive and personable. 
Must try Lemongrass Soup and Basil Beef. The pad thai was decent. The only drawback I have to say would be no Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Thai Fay today (Monday).  It was quiet but got busier around 12:30 pm. The lunch combo of hot and sour soup, green curry chicken and rice plus a small mango salad and a spring roll was fantastic. Great flavour.  I appreciate that the proper Thai cutlery is used (no knife).  The decor leaves much to be desired but who cares, the food and service are great.  My friend had the pad Thai combo and it looked good."}
{"text":"Awesome red curry and coconut rice!  Despite the place is a little run down, food is really good and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant because they had coupons online (and a coworker had suggested it) We were actually pretty surprised that it was empty (we went there at 6:30 PM) Friendly server who was not pushy - suggested dishes when we asked and didn't push for up-sells. Unfortunately, the food wasn't very good. 

I ordered the Vegetarian Green Curry - disappointed because the curry was pretty watery. It was spicy enough, I guess but the watery-ness definitely killed it for me.

Someone else ordered their fried fish - it was dry and not very appetizing at all. 

Not planning on coming back to this one."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Thai so did a quick check to see what was in the area. The restaurant was very easy to find. It is located in the same strip as Demetres and right next to Fox and Fiddle. Fay, the owner is very nice and courteous. 5 stars for the service. She even took the time to give us a brief explanation on the differences between red, green, and yellow curry.

The coconut milkshake was delicious with just the right amount of slush and coconut juice. Pad Thai had a good balance of flavors, a bit spicier than expected but I like spicy. Spring rolls were deep fried to order and was very fresh. It had a slice of mango in it and gave it a nice sweetness to it. We also ordered yellow chicken curry and roti. It was filled with meat and also had potatoes. Finished off with deep fried banana with ice cream. Fay said it was a Thai style dessert. I tried this elsewhere before and I have to say the batter wasn't too thick and it wasn't way too sweet. Just right in my opinion. All in all, a great experience and I would recommend to anyone that appreciates good food and service."}
{"text":"Second time here I got the pad thai special with mango salad, soup, and a fried egg roll. Fresh, quick, and very tasty. Was very hot and needed time to cool down. This is a great deal for great food and sweet service. Booths do not match theme but I can overlook that. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is closed! I went today and there was a letter in the door and the place was empty! Unless I went to the wrong location, but everything I looked up said 115, unit 8. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Only one in here on Thanksgiving.    Tried the mango shake.  Very yummy.   Ordered the chicken spring roll and the owner will special make Bangkok fried rice with mango.   Can't wait to try it. 

If the food is as good as they are nice, This will be a great place. 

Fantastic people. ... owner and get daughter are really nice.   Actually let me use bet phone as s hotspot. 

God was a little bland for my taste.    A lot of rice, and good portion size.    Would have liked more fresh ingredients in the rice. 

They are good quality food, but great quality people.   I'll come back on my next trip to Markham"}
{"text":"This is a decent little Thai restaurant. The interior looks like it used to be a pub or something in a past life and there is Musak playing at all times, so it has a bit of a strange vibe.

In terms of the actual food, we had the chicken satay with peanut sauce and red curry chicken, which I suppose could both be considered mainstays of Thai cuisine. I like that this is authentic cooking -- this really is a mom and pop joint -- but while decent, I've had better. The baked banana was a nice dessert, and the mixed fruit cocktails were tasty.

The service was super friendly. Although we weren't blown away, we'd certainly return."}
{"text":"Tom Khai Kha Soup was ok but nothing great. Cashew chicken was good but there was just nothing special about it. I would eat there again but it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Love the Thai spicy noodle and red curry chicken dishes here. Very authentic Thai curry taste. Their lunch combo comes with choices chicken or beef rice plus spring roll, mango salad, and soup. Reasonable price for its portion size."}
{"text":"Service is really friendly. To the point where I almost feel bad for writing this but food was bad... My pad thai noodles were overcooked and the sauce wasnt good either. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The veggie rolls were delicious!

The pad thai wasn't as authentic or tasty as I'd craved. They were so cheap with the shrimp. the chicken amount was average. lots of noodles though!

The general tso's chicken was delicious but they loaded the plate with vegetables like peppers and onion chunks, and some unnecessary bulks of fried celery. This jipped us from having a decent portion of the poultry, which left us unsatisfied. 

They delivered fast to the hotel and its free delivery on orders over $25. Good deal. The two entrees and the roll app came to $31 + tip. 

I'd probably order from them again if I was as desperate as I was that night. Otherwise I'd probably get something more authentic and generous if I had walked up to a dive restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I try this place, so I gave it a shot seeing I haven't had Thai food in a while. The decor isn't matching at all is what I first noticed when going into the restaurant. The owner carefully took her time to explain the menu because it was a little confusing. Things on the menu weren't separated properly. When the food came, the spring rolls were to die for, just so good. The Thai noodles and beef were cooked nicely and tasted great. Rice and curry, I don't really like spice but the curry with white rice was okay as well. 

Liked it. 4/5"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp! reviews.  It is not bad but I really cannot concur with the high ratings given by other reviewers.

The service is indeed very friendly and the prices are reasonable, but that alone does not make it exceptional.  Tom kha kai was thin, watery and fairly tasteless and Thai hot and sour soup was very sweet with little spice.  The green curry that came on my combo has nice crisp green beans and the sauce was spicy enough, but it lacked flavour.  Other dishes ordered were just average,

Okay if you are in the area but I would not go out of the way for it.

NOTE:  The parking lot tend to fill due to the theater in the building."}
{"text":"Alright, so I thought I would just write a few words about this great Mom and Pop place. I found this restaurant on on yelp (thanks yelp) and have driven by this place hundreds of times. Hungry for either pad thai, or green curry, I thought I would give it a try. Fay is an awesome lady, service was amazing, food... 6.5 out of 10. I'd go back, but, I've made some pretty awesome curries that rival and beat the one I ate here. Great prices, great portions and worth the dough, in a pinch."}
{"text":"Got take out here and I dunno what happened to this place but our food tasted terrible, don't know if they changed owner, chef or whatever but the pad Thai was so poorly cooked, springs looked like they were leftovers from yesterday cuz it wasn't even crunchy at all
Sorry thai fay but I won't be coming back anymore and btw their prices have went up for lunch specials to $8.99"}
{"text":"We came here after playing badminton at the gym next to the Sheraton one weeknight. It was dead - the cook was playing on his cellphone - but we took the risk after our grumbling stomachs argued that we couldn't wait any longer for food.

The main server here was extremely attentive when we came in and asked about the food. Even after we sat down, she gave lots of suggestions and gladly went to find out if there was shrimp paste in the Thai curries. She brought out the can of curry paste from the kitchen, and I confirmed with her that I had used the same vegetarian-friendly brand in the past. 

There were two dinner specials offered, so I went with nasi lemak ($9.99) substituted with tofu instead of chicken. It took less than 15 minutes and the first taste of curry sent me back to memories of Malaysia! The potatoes in the curry were also cooked perfectly to hold its shape and I wish there had been more. It also came with cucumber*, roasted peanuts and an egg - fried instead of boiled. All these are part of a traditional way nasi lemak is presented, minus the dried anchovies.

Not a bad deal for dinner and while the decor here is a bit dingy, it's nice and quiet here if you want to have a chat with a friend over dinner.

{"text":"Fay, the owner, was a total treat! she was kind and took time to explain the menu, and even offered to let us try dessert when we weren't sure about whether to order it. 

the curry was delicious, and so were the spring rolls! the prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some takeout for an early dinner for me and my girlfriend. No surprise the restaurant was empty, but the hostess was very nice and the service was super fast. Ordered half an order of pad Thai, the sweet+sour chicken and 2 orders of rice (on her recommendation - 1 would have been enough) and the bill came to $20 after tax. The chicken was excellent. The pad Thai was pretty standard, possibly a bit less sweet than other pad Thais I've had. Will definitely give it another shot next time I'm in the mood for Thai."}
{"text":"I ordered take out today from this place.. I like it, it doesn't have bold flavors like how I prefer.. but they cook it fresh and I felt light and comfortable right after eating, instead of that heavy feeling you get from eating asian food. I'm a fan! And if I am ever in the area again I would definitely order it. I love the spring rolls, the rice paper ones and the crunchy chicken ones! The sauce is light and sweet/tangy. Nice customer service as well."}
{"text":"Thai Fay Cuisine is a small family runned Thai restaurant in Richmond Hill.

They have specials for the whole day with combo meals that includes Mango Salad and Soup. Or 50% off appeititizers during Happy Hour!

Lunch specials are combos for $7.99. You can upgrade the Hot and Sour Soup to Tom Yum Soup for $1.00.

 I decided to have the Combo B with Green Curry Chicken and Tom Yum Soup. 

Tom Yum soup
The soup is ok.. not too spicy, not too sour. There are 2 shrimps inside. I am not sure if I will do the soup upgrade next time though. 

The Mango Salad, Spring Roll and Green Curry Chicken with Rice 
All come on 1 plate. The Mango Salad is nice and sweet with the Basil dressing. The Spring Roll.. um is ok.. but not really fresh, fills like been under the heat lamp for awhile. The Green Curry Chicken though has 3 chillis on the menu is not spicy..  I love all those veggies though (snow peas, egg plants and green beans)

I told the waitress that the Curry is not spicy at all. She said I can request extra spicy next time. Since their customers cannot handle the heat.

Service is Fast and Friendly. Though Jasmine Tea is NOT free... 

Go to their website since there are coupons that give you discounts or freebies.

They accepts Visa only."}
{"text":"The food at Thai Fay is homey, authentic, good.  I always prefer homey Thai food, instead of fancied up Westernized Thai food.  The few Thai people I personally know are so friendly and genuine that fancy-up is just too pretentious.  

We ordered the dinner combos ($13pp) plus a crab cake appetizer.  Crab cake appetizer was delicious with a heat that lingered after I had swallowed it.  The pad thai tasted tingling not sour, and it satisfied my tummy.  The green curry was spicy, though I hoped it was more creamy and had more herbs.  The mango salad was standard.  The hot and sour soup was hit-my-face sour but somehow the taste grew on me (strange).  In all, the combo had so much food for the price that I told myself that I had to order takeout dinner from here.

Food is good. Service is exceptionally polite and warm (beat many high end restaurants by miles).  The pricing is low, especially for take out.  The decor is a small town-ish, no frills, diner style that can use a freshen up.  No, wait, that 80's look is part of its charm, so just keep it here; a fresh coat of paint to brighten things up is sufficient.

Do reviews matter to Thai Fay?  Despite a four-star average, it had only 2 tables of customers when we arrived for dinner at 6pm last Sunday.  They soon left, and we were the only customers till we left at around 7:30pm.  I saw one take out customer before I left.  

I like this restaurant, its authenticity, its pricing, its charm.  I want more people to discover it from Yelp; I want people to dine in or take out; I want it to stay in business.  The fact that it has charmed me into caring motivates me to give it 4 stars, instead of the 3 stars that it should have gotten.

Here you go: 4 stars."}
{"text":"My family has been dining at and getting takeout from Thai Fay for years! The owners know us and are so friendly and always throwing in extra things. Service in the restaurant is great. Quick and pleasant. I usually order the same thing. It's this combo that comes with Pad Thai or Cashew chicken as a main (both delicious) and a mango salad that I always switch for green, a big spring roll, and hot and sour soup which I always switch for the chicken coconut milk soup (unreal). 

It's always a pleasure to dine here and I will continue to come here always :)"}
