{"text":"I have had their pizza about 15 times now and it is easily the best around.  The cheese and dough is quality unlike the chain places. I have tried all in old Brooklyn and this place is a gem. I've only had pizzas that I picked up but they were always good. I never had a problem or bad pizza from here. I would and do recommend Pizza Joe's to my friends."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this place exsisted till a couple days ago figured hey its close why not try it out and support local businesses. Well my expectations where set to high I guess. I would not recommend this place however didn't try their pizza yes my mistake I order a gyro. Let's just say lettuce was old nothing special about the meat expect they pile too much of it and was undercooked. Then a few onions and two tomatoes and this tasteless gyro which cost 8 bucks was worthy of the trash can. Not sure how you mess up a gyro Sandwhich beside the sauce, the rest is simple would never attempt a pizza here after that probably would find a way to mess that up as well."}
{"text":"YUM. the end. 

I can't believe this place doesn't have any reviews. cheap, great pizza and also damn good breadsticks. it's a little greasier than some, but in a \"this is so good that I feel guilty for eating this much fat\" type of way. the mini meatball pizza is the way to go. 

their salads aren't that great, but there's not many weirdos like me who order salads at a pizza joint so you're probably in the clear."}
{"text":"Quite average.  My delivery took over an hour, but they didn't promise much faster.  All ingredients taste like they came off a truck.  Not much character - nothing crafted in-house.

To their credit: the cheese isn't fake."}
{"text":"Great food.  Quick service.  Great wings and pizza.  Quality price.  Great deals thru the week."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last weekend and was pleasantly surprised!  We got a pizza and breadsticks and both were delicious and very flavorful!!! The prices are unbeatable and the staff/delivery man were really friendly!  

We ordered the large pizza, and it was huge! So if you are ordering for 2 people, I recommend getting the medium."}
