{"text":"Best pupusas ever! I get there chicharon & bean/cheese. There other good smells and looks delicious but I mainly get there pupusas because I don't know how to make them. Everything I we can make. Something about there beans is bomb!"}
{"text":"This cafe has Salvadorean & Mexican food.  Stopped especially for the Pupusas.  You can here them making the Pupusas in the kitchen (couldn't see if they were made to order) I ordered the bean and cheese, loctoro(hope the spelling is right), and porkskin.  It comes with chips, salsa and pickled cabbage.  Side Orders are extra if you want to accompany your Pupusas like sour cream, and guacamole.   I don't recommend the porkskin filling it was too salty.  The bean and cheese taste like home cooking.  The loctoro consist of cheese and vegetable, I liked that as well.  You can upgrade your pupusas to be made out of rice instead of corn.  I also saw that they had Salvadorean beer.  Service was ok they mixed up my order.   Great prices on the Pupusas"}
{"text":"We had a restaurants.com gift card and we saw this restaurant listed on their website. We decided to try it out. The food was good although I ordered a chicken burrito and I was given chicken enchiladas. I was too hungry to send it back. When it came time to pay we were told we couldn't use the restaurants.com gift card because the lady that knew how to redeem them wasn't there. Lucky for us we had money to cover the bill. We tried to go back another time to use the gift card and we were told they won't accept it. They are still listed on restaurants.com that they accept it. I exchanged my card to use at another place and I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I order pupusas to go here all the time! They are really good. I order chicharron con queso and chorizo pupusas. I've never eaten there or tried other dishes so I can't comment on that. People are friendly and the pupusas are made to order. So give your self about 15-20mins for your pupusas to be ready. I'll keep ordering pupusas from here."}
{"text":"Great service!   Called in an order for pick up for 10 people. They were curious, speedy service !  Food was delicious, was hot, and everything was as we ordered.  We  ordered traditional pupusas with cheese. A chubby corn tortilla stuffed with cheese served w a side order of vinegrate cabbage salad. Price was surprisingly affordable.   Restaurant was clean, and easy to find.  Recommend the place, the food, the experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered 5 bean and cheese pupusas, the cheese tasted cheap and the flour tasted like craps. The fried banana was very dry. The only thting that was ok was the horchata and the shrimp cocktail. Would not eat here ever again. I hope I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Just want to make a note that this place is the old place that used to be named Esmeraldas Cafe...the name has changed its now Santa Fe cafe. Salvadorian food... The food is just as good, you might want try their shrimp tacos as the are delicious and the pupusas are just as delicious."}
{"text":"Never again !!! Stay away!! They have no customer service the workers couldn't even hand us a menu or seat my family. They didn't get our order correct and had videos with woman half naked on the tv but it's suppose to be a family oriented place no! And on top of it all the pupusas weren't properly made and me and my son ended up throwing up never had a bean pupusa that bad! Wouldn't ever come back not sure how they have A ."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give 4.5 stars. This place isn't quite a 5-star place, but it is really solid.  As soon as we sat down, we were met with a basket of chips and salsa.  I don't know if they make their chips in-house, but they are delicious.  Warm, light, crispy, and kinda airy. Salsa is solid.  We ordered pupusas and a platano frito plate with beans and cream.  The  fried plantains were perfect - hot, sweet, and caramelized.  The cream is Salvadorean sour cream, which is a bit looser than your standard sour cream, and with more salty than sour flavors. Refried beans were what you would hope for.  Mix the three elements together and you have the perfect Salvadorean breakfast bite.  The pupusas come with a generous jar of curtido -- there's nothing worse than ordering pupusas and only getting a pinch of curtido on the side... there is plenty to go around here. We tried the bean/cheese, loroco, and chorizo flavors. Chorizo was an interesting twist from the usual; certainly not traditional Salvadorean flavor, but it was yummy.  Most pupusas had some cheese coming out the side which got fried and crispy on the flat top.  Yum. Solid, solid pupusas.  I can't speak to their Mexican dishes, but the Salvadorean offerings and chips/salsa did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"we had a great experience our waitress was really nice and friendly and the place was cleaned and crowded we ordered the deep-fried fish and an order of Pupusa and it was really delicious I would definitely recommend this place for Pupusa (702Ro)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, and the wait time for the both of us were over 45 minutes, although there was only one other table of 2 people in the restaurant at that time, and they had gotten their food already. The server also got my order wrong, as there was a big language barrier. Overall, had much better pupusas and service at other local Salvadorian restaurants, so I would not recommend this place or return."}
{"text":"Wonderful food (wet burritos are delicious) The only downfall is they are ALWAYS out of atole."}
{"text":"I don't know what these other reviews are about, I had great service and the food was amazing. I am from Los Angeles Ca, I was visiting my friend for the weekend and I liked this place so much that I ate here all three days. One day for lunch I had the wet burrito, which was SOO good, it's that sauce! Yumm! For dinner I had their crunchy taquitos and the meat inside was well seasoned and just melts in your mouth. The taquitos come with sour cream cheese and shredded lettuce. I ordered a side of beans and rice and it was perfection! Another day the owner recommended the Enchiladas and they were Amazing! Make sure u ask the enchiladas with the wet burrito sauce!! Then my last day I ate the pupusas made out of rice. I spoke with the owner to see what kind of cheese they use and I found out she is the new owner so she uses three different types of cheese and fresh pork. The pupusas are great. No complaints what so ever. I honestly crave her food here in LA. And there are MANY Mex/salvi restaurants here. The food here is literally made to Order, it takes a bit to come out, like a regular sit down restaurant BUT ITS WORTH THE WAIT! Home cooking is the best! The FOOD is awesome! MUY MUY BUENO.. I'm hungry now. Lol"}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrible. They completely forgot to make my food,  my husband was done eating by the time my food came and they were far from busy."}
