{"text":"Talk about a small town experience in a big city. The employees here are really nice and actually remember you when you come in. My husband and I are there often and have never had a bad experience. Sam, Dieffe, Margaret, Star, and Sj (And sweet manager lady that always compliments my hair i don't know her name) are some of the kind people that have gone out of their way to help us and just be nice. Thanks guys for being a great store!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this Food Lion location so it's very convenient for me to shop here. Shopping here is simple and the cashiers are very friendly and are always smiling which makes food shopping here a breeze. My only complaint about this location is the deli attendant that coincidentally seems to ALWAYS be the one working when I'm doing my grocery shopping. This woman is very rude and just has a nasty disposition which makes me feel like I'm bothering her everytime I approach her counter. I was trying to get a look at her name badge but it was hard to see. It looked like it may have read \"Chris\". I was in the store for almost 45 mins and there was no one behind the counter the entire time so I assumed that the deli was closed so I proceeded to checkout but while I was in line, I saw the woman walk behind the deli counterv so I left the line and went to get my deli items. When I approached her and asked if the deli was open, she looked at me like I had 3 heads and yelled \"yeah\". I asked for 1 pound of turkey breast and half pound of cheese. She said \"what is it for?\" \"Sandwiches? (Umm I don't know why the hell that matters). I said for sandwiches. She sliced the turkey and I wasnt really paying attention to what she was doing, but when I got home and went to make a sandwich, I was so upset. My turkey looked like pulled turkey without the sauce. It was in shreds and just a mess, and the cheese was also sloppy. I really wish that Food Lion would get rid of this woman who obviously hates her job and takes it out on the customers. I will continue to shop at this location but I will get my deli meats elsewhere!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the service here today. Normally I'm not a Food Lion shopper, but it's close to home and I needed to grab a few quick things. The store was much brighter and cleaner than I expected, and the service was friendly and helpful. I was delighted when an employee stopped by to bag my groceries when I was using the self-checkout. Definitely a better experience than I planned to have, and I will be shopping here again."}
{"text":"The best Food Lion around.  This store is managed to perfection by John & Ronnie. The employees here are mostly college students who are respectful and polite.  (Jason at the Customer Service Desk ... Brandon, Jimmy, Kade, Kia, etc.).  The floors and shelves are clean, well-stocked and it is always a friendly, easy-going atmosphere.  They also run good specials as well.  Other stores should use this as a model supermarket !!"}
{"text":"I found the other 2 reviews a bit odd.  Being I've just moved to the area it is the grocery store closest to me.  I actually have found my weekly trips there quite pleasant.   They  sale groceries!  They are reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly.   I actually like that this store is just simply a grocery store.  I haven't had to take anything back as I actually look at what I'm buying.  I make sure that things aren't expired and have the produce just as fresh as any other grocery including ones that cost much more.  Fortunately I don't need a triple frapa-latte to enhance my shopping experience.  I just go there to buy food for my family!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to the store they're always begging for money outside the store or selling some bootleg movies"}
{"text":"Great prices, good selection. Staff is always helpful & courteous. Spent 1/2 an hour trying to leave parking lot to get to Tryon. Take the back way out & avoid the TRYON TRAVESTY!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love what they have done with the store!!! Its so neat and bright now. The employees have always been nice to me."}
{"text":"Very nice store good customer service it's close to my house so I visit 1,2 times a day I love it"}
{"text":"Having just moved into the neighborhood not too long ago, I found this store open, clean and with relatively easy and available parking.  The aisles are wide and clutter-free and the shelves are always stocked with the appropriate items.   I've not had any problems with expired foods or wobbly/noisey shopping carts.  My only real complaint is that their website is not organized well enough for me to be able to navigate successfully when making my grocery list.  I had been used to the Harris Teeter website and maybe I was just spoiled by theirs.  The long and the short of it is that it is very close, clean and they have decent sales and available parking."}
{"text":"Pretty sub par grocery store with hardly fresh produce, and a lot of stuff on the shelves that is past the sell by date. Also I am very impressed by the security guards with guns that bag your groceries. But in a pinch this works fine."}
{"text":"This is not one of the best grocery stores to go in the area, especially given the fact that they got rid of their self-checkout registers.  This place is one of the biggest grocery store chains in Charlotte and this particular location is next to one of the biggest college campuses in the state (UNC Charlotte), yet this location completely got rid of their self-checkout machines in favor of a more \"personal\" experience according to one of the cashiers when I asked why they got rid of those.  Since then, the service level has always been horrible in this store.  Lines are always backed up.  If they wanted a more personalized experience, how about hiring some people to make up for the six self-checkout registers you lost.  Food Lion missed the boat big time with this decision.  You made your store look antiquated in front of 25,000 high-tech college students.  I want to know what fool made this decision.  They should be terminated on the spot."}
{"text":"Favorite place to shop. Close to home,  clean, great prices, nice associates. Love the buy one and the other one free. Also convinient open and closing hours till 11:00 PM."}
{"text":"All the yogurt is nonfat....what about those of us who might like whole milk?  Very slim choices for veggie burgers.  1 Boca and something like 3 Morning Stars.  They did have a good selection of nuggets, breaded this n that  No protein drinks  I guess you have to cater to your audience & maybe the workforce & students around here don't seek out what I seek out but given they had 1 out of 3 things I was seeking, have to say I've experienced better"}
{"text":"Clean store with great selections and full shelves and prices are decent too.. Wish there were more closely located around my home instead of stupid Harris teeters"}
{"text":"This is a slightly shady food lion.  Don't ask me why we were cruising around just before 9 PM looking for raspberry seltzer water but we were.  And they had it, 89 cents for a 1 liter bottle.  We also got some potato chips. At a quarter to nine this store has two security guards in front and one inside the store.  The parking lot is riddled with potholes.  The clientele just seem like family people trying to buy groceries, and the store itself is in fine condition.  But all that military presence kind of puts you on alert.  So I think there are better FLs to be visited if that's an option for you."}
{"text":"I really dislike this store. The only reason I come here is because it's the closest store to where I live. I try to time my trips on the way home from work so I can stop at the one on Park Road at Ideal Way. My mom had to have some food for tomorrow so I had to come here after her doctors appointment today. It was 8pm when I arrived. They close at 10pm.  Well because they were stripping the floors tonight, they had moved all the stands of items off the floors.  I had to roam all over the store to find where they had moved the bananas.  And they apparently had stopped restocking way earlier in the day....lots of empty shelves.  Not one single carton of white large eggs.  Gee you couldn't wait until you closed and there were no customers in the store???"}
{"text":"I think I go in this store everyday. I love grocery shopping. The people are friendly and chat with me when go into the store. We even gossip a little... the prices are reasonable and the store's pretty clean. It's my home store..."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, this is a pretty good Food Lion as far as Food Lion's go. Usually they are dingy on the outside and the inside, with meh-quality products and horrible yellow lighting.  I'm happy to report, this Food Lion only possesses the \"dingy on the outside\" quality. Inside, it's one of the nicest Food Lion's you'll see. It's bright and friendly walking in, and you can tell it's kept clean.  It's actually got some good produce and most of the off-the-wall and international items I've looked for while there! The meat selection leaves something to be desired, but everything else is pretty decent.  It's not going to be my go-to grocery store, but I'll be back every once in a while because of the cleanliness and the great location."}
{"text":"Grocery store with an armed guard in bullet proof vest!  Do I need to say more?!  Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is your typical Food Lion. Poor selections in all departments, dirty store, dirty and poorly lit parking lot no organic fruits and vegetables, no baggers and closed self checkouts."}
{"text":"They have updated there food selection witch is nice. When I used to go there as a child it was bad but now they've changed and is worth he money I spend there."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, manager and cashiers very rude. I'm definitely calling customer relations. Food Lion in Pineville NC is the best ever."}
{"text":"As far as Food Lions go, its not bad.  Really, it isn't    *The beer selection along with the prices and deals offered at this Food Lion are matched by few other grocery stores in this city.  *This is one of the few Food Lions that seem to have at least three cashiers on duty most times.  Even when there is a bit of a line to check out, most of the cashiers are quick, and to the point.    *Parking is decent enough.  Plenty of parking in a newly paved, well-light lot make me much more inclined to go here.    *The main drawback for me is the fish and seafood selection; which is pretty much nonexistent sans whats in the frozen section.    Overall, sure, I guess I'm a fan.  its close to where I live.  Its easy to get in and out and they have all the essentials."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 9 years or so, and they've really stepped their game up this year. It looks like they've started hiring a bit of an older crowd... it definitely makes the experience a little better because everyone's sooooo sweet. They've reorganized and cleaned up the store. Parking is 10X easier than the Teet in Plaza, despite still having a small lot. Plus your chances of running into that shitty neighborhood ex are slimmer here. ^_^"}
{"text":"Wow, pleasantly surprised. Very clean and well organized. Plenty of staff and even a security guard. Definitely brought up mixed feelings, shopping with needed security. There's only one way in and one way out. I guess it's to streamline the flow or for safety. If you're looking for customer service, however, it is all business getting you in and out.  They have popular name brand items up to a dollar cheaper than high end grocery stores. Also, their own brand is a great deal on the pocket book.  Convenient location off of South Boulevard and shares a lot with other delicious restaurants."}
{"text":"This simply is NOT a very good store. The ONLY reason I gave it TWO stars is because it's conveniently located to my house. That's it.  This really is a one star store...Why? Their produce section is just not very good. Very small and limited selection. Their meat counter is equally lacking in quality choices. Just their overall regular stock of all selections is quite limited for a store this size.  Unless you need milk or bread, I just wouldn't come to this store....chances are you'll need to go to another store to find what you really need."}
{"text":"Usually busy with limited lines open but they have pretty good sales most of the time, so that's what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty chill. Lines were short during the evening so that was convenient."}
{"text":"I have no problem with the store just don't like the white policeman standing out there with a gun for no reason, food line does not need a security job come on guys do better than that"}
{"text":"Food line is my favorite been going there since I was a child, prices still OK not better than Walmart but people are still nice went there this morning and got a lot of help from from a nice older black woman who help me out with Coffe thank you."}
{"text":"This Food Lion has gone through major changes this year. I am impressed not only with the remodel, but with the quality of produce and the variety of gluten free and organic food options. They have stepped up their game to stay competitive with the surrounding grocery stores. The staff has always been nice to me and there seems to be plenty of staff on the floor, which is great for when I have questions... someone is always nearby. Great changes and weekly deals will make this store my go-to grocery store now."}
{"text":"This is a really nice grocery store. The staff is very personable. They always have what I need. I really enjoy it because it's never super busy or crowded. It is also in a great location."}
{"text":"Clean. Spacious. Staff are polite. There is a greeter that will ask upon entrance, or as you walk towards an aisle, if you need assistance finding something. Much nicer location than others I have been to."}
{"text":"This Food Lion SUUUUUUUUCKS! Short staffed, can't find certain things I can find at other Food Lions. They finally got new card machines and receipts that you can actually read. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Very busy and the staff is really friendly only reason for the 3 stars is the store itself seems run down and there's a lot of security which isn't conducive for causal grocery shopping not to mention the minimal selection they have and a parking lot with more pot holes than parking spaces"}
{"text":"Great Prices, bright, clean store but most(not all) of the employees (especially in the evenings) are not very friendly or helpful. The Deli service is terrible. They act like you are bothering them when you approach the counter.  Only go here because it's close by and the only store in Mt Holly."}
{"text":"Purchase a lemon cake as part of my Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve.  Great price for it.  There were a few lines open but no wait.  Store manager announced he could take any customer rather than the next customer.  Which left me and others waiting patiently to stay put.  Only one exit was open due to a cart blocking the other door from the inside."}
{"text":"It's a Food Lion so it's not going to have all the accouterments you'd see at a higher-end store like Harris Teeter, but this one is usually pretty well stocked, is clean, has good prices, and friendly people. As basic grocery stores go, this is a good one, especially for people on a budget."}
{"text":"The location on Eastway has sub par customer service and the security guard is always weird acting and staring you down. I feel like it's too much."}
{"text":"Late Sunday morning shopping for the week. The store was well kept and not too busy with a great selection and reasonable prices. This time of the day, I had no concerns with security. The store is clean and tidy, the staff was efficient, opening another register when a third person was waiting.  Shelves are stocked and ready. A reasonable amount of produce, the meat bunkers were fresh and inexpensive.  This store is A-OK."}
{"text":"Nice enough staff.  Cute Assistant Manager. Ladies, he's married so he's just eye candy.    That's about all. It seems smaller and they don't turn over produce rapidly so make out with what you need and keep on rolling for the things that can wait.   Parking lot is nicely lit and next door to Doan's, a great Pho place.  I would rather go to the once near Dilworth/Midtown than trek over to this one.   Actually the Beatties Ford location has fresher produce and meat. Yet, again.... Nice staff and a true 2.5 star rating. Nothing higher.   For walkers/commuters:  1) Not 2 full blocks from the Light Rail.  2) One block away from Little Casear's 3) Same strip mall has a laundry mat and Pho so you can accomplish a lot 4) Down the road from Aldi's.  5) Around the corner and down the street from Costco.  6) 2.5 miles from the Target on South."}
{"text":"Location closes at 10pm. Red box inside the store. Knowledgeable staff. Decent produce.  The real drawback about this place: You have to read the expiration dates on products, marked down or otherwise, because they will sell you something near or at expiration."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit here.  I was there between 10:30 & 11:30am.  Very clean store, smaller, but with plenty of choices for anything you want - but not overwhelmingly so, which can be refreshing really.  Good value with store brands.    The produce department is small, but well kept, fresh and clean with plenty of choices.  It's on the right as soon as you come in the door which is a good placement for the that as most people turn right into a store.  Some organic options available in the meat department where it makes the most difference to me.  One thing I noticed is they are lacking on the low-fat, low-salt options that I know are available for several items I was looking at.  I was surprised at that because it seems that their clientele is a lot of minority or lower-income and would benefit from those options.  The staff were all friendly, especially Britany in the Deli department.    I found the pricing and options sufficient for my needs and though it isn't always convenient, it was this day.  I checked out with my own reusable bags and the checkout girl didn't seem to know what to do with them.  I told her I'd bag my groceries myself if she wanted me to, but she was game and pleasantly took care of them for me.  As noted, I went during the morning and it was mostly retirees in the store.  About the time I left though, there was an influx of ... a bit of weirdness.  Maybe it's just my lack of diverse experiences, but I was glad I was heading out.  I don't know that I'd want to be in here in the evenings.  I hate to say that, but sometimes, that's just the way it is."}
{"text":"Seriously? I have never disputed a fellow Yelper's review.. but I'd like to see the stats saying this Food Lion is one of the best rated Food Lion's in the entire QC area... It's about the same as any of them. At least, unlike the one on Graham and Sugar Creek their back room doesn't stink of people smoking.. That was horrible.   What can you say about Food Lion? They are all over the place? There are as many (if not more of them) than Starbucks? The best part about this one is that if you live in the Mount Holly area, it seems most people have been coming here all their lives and the staff have worked there almost their entire lives (seemingly as everyone knows everyone else).   Ok.. MecklenGuy.. is there such a thing as a good Food Lion beyond what we all know as Food Lion? Answer: YES!!  The best Food Lions that will blow your mind away are just across the bridge from Mt. Holly on Mt. Holly/Huntersville road at Mt. Holly road and by far.. the number 1 Food Lion is in the tiny little town of Stanley on Charlotte Ave.. Can you believe it? ORGANIC products? at a Food Lion? There's some proof there's some old money in Stanley.   As always.. if you or any of your team is killed or caputred while on a Food Lion mission, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of your existence. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I live right by this food lion and go to it often. Every time I shop I find something expired this took the cake how is a frozen pizza almost 4 months expired still on the shelves!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know that I would say that they are an especially bad Food Lion - but if you compare them to a Harris Teeter or Lowe's, they will probably come out looking a bit worse, as Food Lion is definitely not fancy compared to those.  They probably will not be overpriced compared to them, however.  I've always found the staff at this location to be friendly, though I would definitely keep an eye on the meat.  In fact, I would probably do that at just about any Food Lion.  I don't think they are intentionally doing anything bad to it, and meat that is close to its expiration date will be marked down, but sometimes those cuts look pretty bad.  Keep your eyes on it and you should be fine."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the better Food Lion stores I've visited in Charlotte. You can tell they're trying to compete in the grocery wars game.   I'll admit it, Harris Teeter and Trader Joe's are my go-to's. But let's be honest, that Plaza Midwood HT gets bat ish crazy sometimes. If I can't find a spot in their parking lot, I head to this Food Lion. Don't even attempt that HT when Charlotte loses its mind over snowmageddon, come straight here. I don't love the meat and seafood options, but overall this place gets the job done for a basic grocery store run.  It's great spot to grab beer and wine. Pretty decent selection and there's usually deals/sales of some sort. Shout out to the cashiers for always having an MVP card number for me to use."}
{"text":"When I'm in a pinch for something quick and low priced, I'll head reluctantly to the Food Lion instead of the Harris Teeter by my house. This review isn't for ALL Food Lions because I've been to some pretty nice ones... it's just this one.   First, I don't like going there by myself, because it just doesn't scream \"SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD\" at me as I'm walking in. I mean I know there is typically an officer standing there when you go in or two...But it's not so unsafe feeling that I won't go by myself. I just prefer not to.   But for a grocery store, it's decent. The produce section isn't really that amazing, but the bakery section is. I know this store is after my own heart because I'm a junk food junkie...who needs fruits and veggies anyways right???   I signed up for the savings program they have and honestly I do feel I save more here than at many local stores. I'm sure I'll begrudgingly return.   Oh and they'll never have a shortage of shopping carts... I guess enough people ticked them off by stealing them that the parking lot now has sensors that will lock up the wheels for any would be thieves. See, that's reassuring right??"}
{"text":"PLEASE educate Malek on the use of coupons.  I purchased (5) of the 6 Packs of  Dr. Pepper.  I had 2 coupons.  IMMEDIATELY Malek told me I could only use 1 of the coupons.  The coupons specified 1 coupon for the purchase of (2) 6 Packs.  I asked him to get the manager.  Quickly the manager and another employee told Malek to scan the other coupon.  How many other customers has he misinformed?"}
{"text":"Not impressive.  The store was open late (9p), but there was hardly anyone working here.  Their selections were as sparse as a Soviet bread store. Want bottled coffee? You have two choices- regular and decaf. Want sandwiches? They've got 3 types to choose from.  They didn't have a lot of the stuff I was looking for, stuff that you'd expect to find at the typical grocer.  Parking was easy, but the lot was not well lit.  The floors were sticky, and the prices higher than I'm accustomed to.  In my opinion, do your shopping elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's clean, organized, and employees have smiling faces and are helpful. I've never had a long wait... What more could you ask for from a grocery store? Aside from an in-store Starbucks so you could sipNshop, pretty much the only way any Food Lion could get a 5th star from me :-P If I HAD to find a flaw, lights are WAY too bright in there it's like walking on the Sun if the Sun were a never-ending camera flash... Blinding"}
{"text":"I've never had an issue at this Food Lion location. I've always been able to find most of the items I've been looking for. The staff was helpful and friendly today. Although this isn't my usual Food Lion, I don't mind using this location from time to time."}
{"text":"Early Sunday morning visit to pick up something for breakfast. Should have taken five minutes. One single cashier line open and the cashier was engaged in a conversation with the preceding customer and refused to look at me or the people in line behind me. I though I was being punked or in a comedy skit. I didn't dare interrupt her dialogue and five minutes became fifteen. I should have posted on the food lion site but nothing came from the last time I posted in regard to being yelled at by a food lion deli counter employee at another FL location. If you have too much self esteem and endless amounts of time then I suggest you shop at this store."}
{"text":"Faster and better than Wal-Mart nearby if you don't mind paying a few cents more. You 'll get the essentials here."}
{"text":"I dread having to go into this store, the staff are very rude and are so slow. I only go into this place if I'm desperate.. The store is semi clean and shopping carts are always all over the parking lot. So be careful where you park, unless you want a dent in your car. The parking lot is very hectic to get into and out of so be prepared to drive defensively.  Overall only go if you really need to."}
{"text":"I was grabbing takeout from the near by Indian restaurant (give them a try! really good) and while they were preparing it, I stepped across the shopping plaza to Food Lion to grab some beers and other necessities.  Clean and bright, unlike some other Lions I've shopped. Produce section was well stocked and it looked fresh. Prices were quite decent.  Checkout took a bit (a sudden rush and then someone decided to wait until the end of the transaction to whip our her checkbook. I hate that!). Otherwise, all good.  It's South Boulevard, so watch your six.  I would return!"}
{"text":"In a neighborhood that is a bit more up-and-coming than South End or Steele Creek where I usually do my food shopping but they definitely get there on price.  My shopping experience was pleasant. I found almost everything that I was looking for, only needing to hit up Publix for a few bits. The deli here needs help and the produce isn't as bright as the others, but the grocery section is great. Beer and wine is pretty good for a supermarket as well.  On the outside, the cart corrals were clear but I did spot some significant litter in the parking lot. And while Meg (who is super!) was ringing up and bagging my groceries, I saw two Food Lioners just leaning on carts and chatting rather than helping."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood (at the Restore next door) and thought I would pop in for a quick and cheap shop. Well, I was wrong. I didn't feel that the prices here were all that great. They had all the usual name brands and a decent meat department (chicken feet! ick!).  I had to return my shopping cart because the first one I grabbed had a flattened wheel.  I also tried to sign up for their \"MVP\" shopper loyalty card, but they were out of applications. There's a huge price difference with the card, so fortunately the cashier was willing to run it on his card."}
{"text":"This is the worst Food Lion I have been to. Unfortunately it is very close to my home so from now on I will have to go out of my way to do my grocery shopping. What makes this the worst? Well its the food. It is about every other shopping trip I end up with something expired or spoiled. Now the customer service is okay, and they have always given me my money back or an exchange. But the final straw was when I purchased breakfast sausage this past Sunday. I opened the package and started to form the first patty when the most foul smell took over my kitchen. It was so bad I almost got sick. This was not expired. It was so bad I could not take it back to the store. Customer service did give me my money back.   Unfortunately with this not being the first time, in fact it is about every other time, I am having to go back and explain the food is rotten or expired. That breakfast sausage experience really traumatized me. I am glad they appologized but they need to just fix the issue. And yes, I got my money back, but I really felt like they should have done more.   Now I am going out of my way to do my shopping. Boo Food Lion on Eastway drive."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I'll never feel comfortable when I'm shopping in a grocery store and there is an armed security guard by the door. Other than that it was close to our hotel and they did have a couple specials but nothing that would make me get over excited. The cashier was super nice and she is the only reason I give this two stars."}
{"text":"Food Lion is located in the strip mall across the street from UNC Charlotte's campus. With where it is located it isn't really near any residential areas (besides those living on campus and a few apartment complexes). Mostly I've seen college students when I visit the store. I don't think I've ever seen a family doing full on grocery shopping here.   Times that I have been in here the meat case had tons of the \"reduced\" stickers. That to me means they aren't really selling and their stock isn't that fresh. Gross.   Food Lion is really the underdog with this area being dominated by Harris Teeter and Walmart right down the road from this store.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it close."}
{"text":"Food Lion was always just okay for me. Not really my go to store but for some reason we ended up coming here and they made some major changes in the store.  The store itself is more clean, they have these register signs which make it easy to find what kind of lane you are looking for.   The produce they stock now is amazing. Fresh and lots of choices. And the meat they carry is good quality. They carry the all natural fresh line of meat now which is amazing. I like eating my meat without additives and hormones. I have also been able to find sausages without any added sugar, soy or anything weird. And with eating paleo and whole 30 now - this is everything to me.   I love that they have a little badia section of dried herbs too. Since I have started making my own dressing - this has become a go to for me. These little packets of dried herbs pack a big punch.  On my last visit - I needed help finding some product and the guy couldn't help me but he got on his little ear piece and found the person that could. Amazing. Customer Service at it's best.  I originally started this review as a 3 star but just thinking of how much better food lion is now - I had to bump up to 4."}
{"text":"I love shopping at Food Lion when I visit NC, they have excellent prices and this Food Lion was very nice and clean inside, employees were friendly but because it's so nice, it's always crowded, they could use some extra cashiers in the morning and near end of shift hours. Even when buying things like body wash here, it's fairly cheap considering it's being bought from such a nice grocery store. You really do save a lot of money by shopping here especially when using your MVP card."}
