{"text":"Délicieux pour le lunch, la mère et la fille tiennent cet endroit typique et je n'ai jamais été déçu!"}
{"text":"This is a little new counter spot on Bernard, with a few bar seats for those who want to eat in. The menu looks fresh, healthy and plentiful. I ordered the garlic roasted pork loin sandwich, on olive bread (with homemade mayo). It was quite tasty. I can't wait to try other menu items. Friendly and fast service, very cute atmosphere, I will be back and write a follow up!"}
{"text":"Came here biting into the second half of my el cashew crudo, a vegan wrap of sorts. I can't stop eating it as I write this. It is absolutely bursting with flavor, the sauce is beautiful and tasty, the raw veggies are at optimal freshness and crispness. Definitely returning here soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a Peruvian food lover and today I tried this place! I really loved it! I ordered the Aji de Gallina (my favorite) and my gf ordered a Homemade Peruvian paella. Both were really tasty, a good portion (based on the price) and they were quickly served, no long waiting time. Also, the place is really well decorated with a particular counter! :) The service as well was really nice and helpful! We also had a Chicha Morada drink, tasteful and refreshing!  I don't think you will be able to eat a good Peruvian food for a reasonable price like this in any other place in Montreal! I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very nice food and very fresh. We had a fruit juice, a chicken sandwich and two vegetarian empanadas. All tasty. Pretty vegetarian friendly too. Will definitely be back. Take out only."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. I am usually a cynic when it comes to vegan food. The first time I came I got the Aji de gallina and my girlfriend got the cashew crudo (vegan). Both were 20/10 worth while but I have to give a special shoutout to the cashew crudo. It was so flavoursome, but made completely of veggies and spices and cashews (no bread or anything). I now understand how vegans can enjoy their meals. Empanadas are also very good value for money. I have been back 4x and counting this week. Every time I try something new and every time I love it."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and dishes, it's good that they have a veggie option though that one doesn't seem that authentic...cashews? But everything that I've tasted that's traditionally Peruvian was pretty good."}
{"text":"Petite place acceuillante mais endroit chaud , tres jolie decoration, service familiale, juste 2 petite tables et mini comptoir sur palce, la empanada gout correct mais je suis curieuse du reste du menu.."}
