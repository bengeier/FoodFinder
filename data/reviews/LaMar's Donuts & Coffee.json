{"text":"Love this place!  Only possible complaint is that they run out too early.  Donuts are huge, fresh and delicious.  This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I don't get it regarding the Lamars reputation. The donuts are so average. The coffee is nothing special either. It may sound snobby but I have high standards because I have had donuts from bakeries in New York. Now those are a real treat to look forward to. I'm glad LaMar's has their fans but I will not be going back. I'm done trying them and each time hoping it will be better than the last visit.  The Bell and 23rd Ave location is clean and comfortable. The service is friendly. I don't care for the twenty something music playing overhead and it is too loud."}
{"text":"It's delicious donuts, what's not to like?! My personal favorite is the classic donut with some chocolate frosting on top. I can eat those all day. Their cake donuts are a bit dense for me, but still delicious. I always come in thinking I'll only buy one or two and then walk out with half a dozen. Whoops..."}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people like their donuts but I just haven't had one I thought was better than an average donut like Dunkin.  You can tell they are fresh but it's just not the amazing donut place I hoped for."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Come here for the original glazed. The cake donuts are good but I've had better. These beat krispy kreme in every way. Coffee is reasonably good too."}
{"text":"The strawberry doughnuts are wonderful. They are simply the best that I have ever had. Ray's double chocolate is equally yummy, and not dry like most chocolate doughnuts. My husband loves the Raspberry bismark. We drove all the way from Buckeye to the Phoenix location and it will well worth the drive."}
{"text":"This donut shop is great. Very clean with friendly staff. The donuts themselves are massive and very tasty! You could pay less at Dunkin Donuts but the size and quality simply doesn't compare to Lamar's.     Some great donuts here are: original glazed, maple bar, devils food chocolate cake, old fashioned glazed just to name a few. In my opinion I have not yet found a better donut than Lamar's. The only downside if any is the price which for donuts is steep at nearly $10 a dozen but for something you enjoy in moderation these donuts are worth the gold plated price."}
{"text":"Best donuts !!!! Just can't believe franchise can't even afford to place your donuts on a paper plate !!! Poor taste in my opinion . Shld have been wrapped  in a wax paper or napkin !!! I was told that was how corporate wants it !!!"}
{"text":"Great place for awesome doughnuts The place is clean the staff is always friendly conceding its so early when I go. I Would recommend it if you want one doughnut or dozens"}
{"text":"It's 7a. Why no plain cake donuts?! Ridiculousness. Call me old-fashioned, but not every donut needs to be covered in gummy worms or a pound of frosting. It's almost impossible to get a plain cake donut here anymore and yours are so damn good! Get with it, LaMar's!"}
{"text":"I'm always slightly concerned when people who are dealing with customers are not excellent at customer service, ie. friendly conversation, smiles, even eye contact. I initially felt rushed and like I wasnt \"valued\" but it didn't take long to see why...they had barely opened and were practically full with patrons!  They were literally still bringing donuts from the back to meet the demand. And they are amazing...the \"White Castle\" of donuts. Busy little joint that you might miss right off the expressway. Will absolutly be back!"}
{"text":"One of my coworkers brings Lamar's donuts in every couple of weeks. They are AMAZING. Besides being abnormally large, they are also really delicious. My favorite is their BOSTON CREAM."}
{"text":"Their donuts are sooooo good!  It reminds me of this local donut shop by my house growing up.  You can tell they are made fresh. The staff is very friendly. If you're in Phoenix, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Yes, LaMar's is THE place for Donuts.  Enough said."}
{"text":"The holy Grail of doughnuts in Phoenix. Everthing from the chocolate frosted to the cinnamon cake are sublime. No botique flavors or appearance just friendly people and stellar doughnuts."}
{"text":"https://www.saveology.com/phoenix-west  $5 for $10 worth of Lamar's goodness!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in this part of town for sure and they coffee is super delicious as well. They have a drive thru which is lovely! The glazed and chocolate twists, the apple fritters, and the chocolate glazed long johns are my favorite."}
{"text":"You might see from my other reviews that I have long thought BoSa has the best donuts in the valley.  Well, I have tried Lamar's, and I think their donuts might be a little better.  The donuts at Lamar's are fresh and light and tasty.  The reviews indicated the selection is limited late morning,  but at 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday they appeared to have just about everything in stock.  They keep primarily to the standards, for good reason.  They just make really good donuts.  Their one location in the NW valley isn't as convenient for me as BoSa's two locations, and they might be just a little more expensive.  But I vote their taste and selection just a little better.  So they get a 5-start rating, the same as BoSa.  If you go to either of these donut shops you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat!   Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!!   I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties."}
{"text":"When my friend and I came here initially it seemed that we were after the morning rush and a LOT of the donuts were already sold out unfortunately. Luckily for us we still found some donuts that looked very good and grabbed some espresso from their espresso bar! The donuts tasted very good and nothing beats fresh espresso in the morning. The floor-to-ceiling windows are also a very nice aesthetic as you munch down on donuts and watch the cars drive by. If you're in the area and looking for donuts, I highly recommend Lamar's."}
{"text":"Not everyday is perfect.  I drive a little ways to get here and not usually dressed to go inside.  This morning I had Lamar craving. Drove over and was greeted in drivethrough. Asked to wait.  It's hot so I drove to window where is shady.  I was the only vehicle; i waited a pretty darn long time... honked my horn and tapped on window.  I was just getting ready to call them on my cell. .. and was in process of writing angry review when they came to window and profusely apologized. ... it was truly an oversight and they are busy inside.   I got my order. Everything was good. Things happen sometimes. .. but it's how a business handles them that matters.   Like always the staff was wonderful and i will be back."}
{"text":"I went to Lamar's and got a dozen glaze donut holes, an original chocolate Lamar's Bar, and an old fashioned sour cream. It would be difficult to pick a favorite out of the bunch because they were all spectacular! The donut holes were large with the perfect airy texture and the chocolate Lamar's Bar easily followed suit.  If you ever pass by or are within a hundred miles of this place and are looking for a donut just go to Lamar's. You can thank me later"}
{"text":"This is the only place for donuts in the valley.  A friend of mine who drives by Lamar's on her way to work, picked some up for the office.  I just happened to be in her office that day.  I usually don't eat donuts, but they were so temping . . . large, fresh, fragrant in the box.  I couldn't resist.  The assortment was overwhelming but I managed to pluck out an apple fritter which was the size of a dinner plate.   It was the best I ever had . . . The next week, I asked her to pick me up an assortment on her way to work, and I'd stop by . . . I couldn't wait to try the Bavarian filled Bizmark, and when I bit into it, every bite was filled with the luscious creme.  I ordered a dozen and ended up making a little tour of North Scottsdale, dropping a quarter one of this and a quarter one of that for my friends and family to partake of the calorie-laden but oh so scrumptious delights."}
{"text":"LaMar's Donuts are out of the world. I'm not a real donut person but when I want one I go to LaMar's. I've have stopped in a couple of time around the holidays to buy LaMar's Donuts for my co-workers and the staff that is there at 5:30 am are great. You get service with a smile. Thank you."}
{"text":"We rode our bikes here all to work of the calories from splitting 3 doughnuts.  I choose the old fashioned sour cream donut, lemon filled Bismarck, and we asked for \"the best\" one and she quickly choose the cinnamon crumb because \"her son loves it\".  We sat and shared these yummy gems that were not overly sweet yet fluffy and delicious.  The Lemon Bismarck is huge and the filling plentiful and creamy yellow.  The sour cream doughnut was my favorite because of the dense moist but crispy texture.  The crumb was probably the best one- we loved the phoenix suns sprinkles.  Will be back asap!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.  I love Krispy Kreme as much as the next guy who can no longer see his shoes when he looks down thanks to eating dozens of those little glazed beauties.  But Lamar's is simply a different kind of doughnut, and I love them!  Unlike Krispy Kreme, which is like some sort of little halo of flaky deep fried pastry, Lamar's is a giant, bready, soft, chewy ring of ecstasy, coated with all sorts of delicious icings and glazes.  Is icing and glaze the same thing?  Maybe.  But I'm willing to keep experimenting until I find out for sure.  And Lamar's is the place to do it.  Maybe if their name was Le Mars, then you would have a friendly little petite circle of pastry en Francais.  But, this is Lamar's, and he ain't messin' 'round with no pastry.  If you live anywhere near Lamar's Doughnuts, you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Honestly . . . Not worth the hype. Yes the donuts are big. . . I had a chocolate Lamar's Bar (Long John). . I did Not like the chocolate, it tasted cheap. My husband and I got belly aches before we left. I threw mine in the trash I was disappointed. Maybe the other donuts taste better. . Either way. We are Not coming back. Bosa Donuts you're? still #1"}
{"text":"Lamar's \"fluff\" filled donuts are delicious, and the staff is really friendly and fast.  The line some times gets long and occasionally the shop runs out of the chocolate and maple bars that I love, but, overall, Lamar's Donuts is one of my favorite places to get donuts in Phoenix.  YUM!"}
{"text":"LaMar's makes the best donuts in Phoenix in my opinion. The red velvet donuts are wonderful and they make special donuts for different holidays that are also delicious.  I've always eaten the donuts to go, so can't speak to the experience of having coffee in the shop, but I would totally recommend Lamar's  is a great place to pick up a dozen donuts for a meeting, the office, or a family breakfast.  Brenda at LaMar's makes the best donuts!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this location but today the customer service was terrible I was standing there for more than a minute without any acknowledgement  (I was the only person in the place) before an older woman came out. She didn't listen to the doughnuts I wanted even after I corrected her twice. I STILL ended up with the wrong doughnuts. Usually the staff is great and I love going but today was not worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"This place is great. The original glazed donuts are what you come here for: Light, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, yeast donuts, covered in sugar.  Drive through is a plus if you're just looking to pick up a box on your way to work!"}
{"text":"LaMar's has good donuts. Not amazing, but way better than a Fry's bakery and just a little better than Dunken Donuts. Unlike Dunken Donuts, LaMar's seems to always have a good selection."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Had to provide coffee and donuts for some work meetings and this was the perfect place! Called in my order at 5:30am and it was ready to o by 6:15am. The donuts are delicious and so is the coffee. The staff were so polite and helpful I love this place!! I will be back when next in Tulsa"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in town ! Crispy Apple Fritters & Old Fashion Buttermilk. Their Cherry Glaze ROCKS. Every doughnut tastes soooo fresh. Try Lamar's one time and you will never buy doughnuts anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great donuts! Lots of choices! Everything we got was fresh. I really liked the dining area. At some donut places, it is more of an after thought. Service was quick. Get there early for the best selection."}
{"text":"These donuts are ok. Some are dry. I feel all donuts should be banging and they are not. It really depends when you come. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they are not. Staff is interesting too.  I don't get all the hoopla here."}
{"text":"LaMar's donuts has by far my favorite donuts in the Phoenix area! We've had them at work many times & they're the perfect morning treat. For me, the thing that sets them apart from all the donuts at other local shops is their dough & size. Their original donuts (glazed, chocolate iced, sugar, & cinnamon sugar) are super fluffy on the outside with a soft doughy interior and they're larger than the typical donut so you can savor every bite!  I pretty much go for a chocolate iced donut every time but have tried other varieties including the cake donuts. The first time that we headed north after finding out about this place, I told my fiancé we needed to stop in to get a donut. He's not a huge fan of donuts & was very skeptical, but after looking at the case of donuts & trying a small bite, he said, \"you know, maybe I should get two .. or three, just in case!\" Totally worth the drive and definitely worth stopping by when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"WOW! These donuts are just delightful!    I took my 7-year old niece there yesterday and was flabbergasted!   The large selection of donuts, the hot, mostly-tasty coffee, and the cleanliness of the store made it a very pleasant experience.  Their long-johns are the longest long-johns i've ever seen!  they even have what i think are Texas donuts, not quite as big as my head, but close.   The featured 'donut-flavor of the month' is blueberry.  I'm not a fan of blueberry, but I'd be interested in trying a new flavor every month.    My only criticism: it looks like they had an early rush & ran out of the more popular flavors.  Maybe there was a city-wide craving for chocolate sourcream donuts?  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The donuts were all pretty meh, I mean they tasted good because they're donuts... but they certainly werent anything special for that price. The fluff donut was a let down. I did however enjoy that giant apple friter. Overall, the price is too high for the quality of donut."}
{"text":"I would say 5 star taste for what is available in Phoenix Arizona.   Now is it 5 star across the board against the best donuts in the United States???  Well it could hang with those places in Chicago and Oregon. LaMar's is a straight forward great donut..   Only problem is, if you don't get here early and I mean 5:30 AM early.  Forget it.. Your selection will be limited to nothing as 11 am approaches.  And it isn't a cheap donut.  A dozen is almost 20 bucks if you don't want the basic as they call it donut with a hole in it.  I really didn't like how they played games with the style of donut pricing.  Like that isn't a doughnut that is a apple fritter kind of bullshit.  But hey they still are top notch doughnuts.  4 Stars, knocked 1 star for not more straight forward pricing."}
{"text":"You \"donut\" what the meaning donuts is until you have had a donut from Lamars. Except you literally cannot have just one, they are that good. I live in South Scottsdale and travel out to the West side to enjoy these little bundles of heavenly goodness. The crew at this shop has always been amazing and nice. Pro tip, go early for a wider selection! Because these babies go fast! They have an array of flavors and toppings and they also have cake and regular donuts.   My favorite part is that they feel homemade, not manufactured.   These are what donuts are supposed to be like, it's my new golden standard.   The end."}
{"text":"I'm scared of donuts! I'm GF on the weekdays, but when I indulge.... Donuts, however make me afraid that my will power of steel will melt. The way the sour cream blueberry donut melts in your mouth on a Saturday morning. Oh I wish they carried almond milk, but I'll bring some next time. The next time my imprisoned alter ego breaks loose and says \"give my some fried flour and butter!\" I'll drive the 6.5 miles to this lovely sanctuary and won't feel guilty bc those are the best blueberry donuts I've had in my travels. My well travelled sister also agrees. Sigh..."}
{"text":"If you like old-fashioned donuts - the denser kind, they have some good ones.  The regular donuts, Bosa and Lucky Donuts do way better.   Now, for the reason as to the 2 stars. I have frequented this place a few times.  I love crullers and for some reason nobody really makes them.  I guess they are tough to make and if you mess up the batch is done and time wasted, materials, etc.   Now, they are almost always gone at Lamar's everytime I ask.  Aside from two times.  The first, I bought a dozen (charged half a dozen) - end of day discount - which is standard at donut shops when they are about to close.  You will toss them anyway.   I appreciated this, even though the kid that works there makes you feel like he is trying to put you in a broken car not sell you a tasty treat.    I get home, and my friends and I are baffled at how bad they are.  I mean, oversized, no air pockets and are crullers supposed to be soggy?   Fast forward to today. I go to get some food and stop by cause it is Friday - cruller day.  Maybe they will have some left and they will be good.  Oversized again.  I go, can't be as bad as last time they have to be at least a bit better.  Wrong!  Oh, and charged full price by the girl working there with 20 minutes till closing.   Honestly, this shop does not deserve a 4.8 like it has.  Maybe a 3.8, maybe a 4 but almost a 5?  Wrong!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of donuts in 2 price ranges depending upon type and size of donut. I enjoyed the LARGE jelly filled donut-very tasty! They are baked fresh every day and there are some days that they sell out early.  There coffee is a little too strong for me and not as flavorful as in some other places. All in all, a very good place to satisfy your donut cravings!"}
{"text":"One of the best donut shops I've been to in a long time. Donuts are delicious. Service is friendly. We especially like that they have \"fluff\" filled donuts. That is hard to find these days. It's totally different than Bavarian creme. As it suggests, light and fluffy. Delish! I like to get the maple long john filled with white fluff."}
{"text":"The best donuts in the valley The size is more than enough they are pretty big compare to other shops. The actual dough is just amazing it is not hard or dry it is just the best and most tasting thing you can put in your mouth. I do like going anywhere else but here. My favorite is the glazed donuts but I have tried a few others and they are all good. Their coffee are good too and the staff is always friendly. I live about 15 minutes away but it is worth the drive in the morning to get a donut  Love love love this place"}
{"text":"REALLY cool place with AMAZINGLY good doughnuts. A few of them are kind of odd and I don't much care for myself, the German Chocolate Knot is a bit dry inside but overall if you stick with the traditional style doughnuts they are out-of-this-world good. I really wish they could open some more locations around the valley and country for that matter!"}
{"text":"First all the good:  The coffee is the best.  The employees will make whatever type of drink you want and they have the ability to make.  If for any reason you are not happy they will fix it.  The donuts are SO good.  Fresh, tasteful and big.  Some donuts at other places leave a film on the roof of your mouth, never at Lamar's.  Super, super nice people and great coffee and donuts.   You will not find a snobby coffee house attitude here. Now the little bad:  A few of the ladies can be stand-offish.  Not for sure why as I treat everyone the same but I have observed it's not just me they are this way too.  It can be uncomfortable when you go from person to person and they are much less friendly then the last person who helped you.  Second thing is sometimes you are charged for syrups and sometimes you aren't.  It can be frustrating to go in with $2 in cash and then you have to use a debit card because the same order from one day to the next is now a different price based on one of the employees at the register and what they decide to charge. Overall this is my go to coffee place and I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of donuts, so I don't have a huge amount of donut \"experience\" from which to draw. As a side note - I just don't give out 5 stars loosly. In fact I rarly give anyone 5 Stars. 5 Stars to me means everything was above and beyond my expectations. Lamar's is donuts done the way donuts should be. Which is why I didn't give them 5 Stars.  There's not much more to say - every flavor they make is delicious - I don't even know if I could pick a favorite.  They are all absolutely delicious (They are not overly sweet like Krispy Kreme ).  I prefer them greatly over Krispy Kreme and of course any grocery store donuts.   Let me tell you why we recently stopped here to get some donuts. I was watching a TV called \"Shark Tank\" .  Shark Tank is an American reality TV series. The show features a panel of \"potential investors\", called \"sharks\", who consider offers from \"aspiring entrepreneurs\" seeking investments for their business or product. The entrepreneur or \"contestant\" can make a deal on the show if a panel member is interested.   I saw a a compay on the show called Tom+Chee. They serve all kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches and old fashioned tomato soup. Anyway the featured a Grilled Cheese Donut ( a glazed donut cooked kije tou would any other grilled cheese sandwich. I was intrigued  by this thus the need to visit Lamar's Donut Shop. Plus I needed a large sized donut and Lamar's are bigger than most other donuts. By the way the donut grilled cheese sandwich we made was a little to sweet for my liking but everyone else who tried it, loved it.  FOOD:  Just what you would expect from a fantasic donut shop - delicious. PRICE: reasonable prices. SERVICE: customer service here isreally nice and helpful.  AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like any other donut shop  CONCLUSION:  Donuts the way they are supposed to be, which actually isn't as easy to come by as you would expect. If you're into dounuts seriously this place!"}
{"text":"These are the world's greatest donuts.  They had quite a few locations in the Las Vegas area years ago that all of a sudden closed once I got hooked.  When I was transferred to Scottsdale I could not believe that I had location within a few miles of me.  The donuts are just amazing.  They are not overly sweet like Crispy Creme, but are tasty and fresh.  I honestly cannot imagine getting a doughnut from anywhere else.  I stopped by yesterday to pick up a few dozen for my co-workers, who had never heard of you guys, and they are all now huge fans.  I seriously hope you continue to expand in the area.  Your donuts should be up there with the likes of Dunkin, Crispy, and all the other chains in terms of name recognition.  They are amazing."}
{"text":"A co-worker brought this into work one Friday... I became an instant fan. I am not big on sweet or donuts but this place is sooo good. The donuts are huge and they taste homemade not commercial like Crispy Kreme. I order the manager's dozen for work for Fridays."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts! Very light and fluffy. My kids and I came for a fun morning out and were treated to a great experience. It was clean and the service was prompt. While we were there the servers came out and sang happy birthday (quite well I might add!) to a little boy along with a lighted candle on his donut! It was perfect!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best doughnuts in the valley.  Better the BoSa, better than rainbow and dunkin doesn't even come close.  Don't be worried about the long line when you get here, the staff will get your order filled and you on your way in a matter of minutes.  The drive thru is always moving along but I'd recommend going inside.  The smell is incredible and they have classic rock playing all day.  After getting you box of fried goodness and the weather permits, have a seat outside to enjoy you box of the best doughnuts in town.  Always friendly, fast, and the price is just right.  My biggest piece of advice is I would show up as early as possible.  On the weekends the display counter gets emptied fairly quickly so if you want the biggest selection possible you better get moving."}
{"text":"Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one, can we please list that \"only the donuts with holes\" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else.     Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business."}
{"text":"Went in today for iced tea and donuts.  When my daughter realized she ordered the a cake donut (which she wasn't a fan of) instead of the regular chocolate sprinkled donuts, she was sad and disappointed after biting through it. She ate the top half only. But Alice and Kathleen saved the day with their hospitality and kindness!  When I told them my 4 year old daughter liked a specific donut, she specifically made that donut for her, bagged it up and gave it to her for free! My daughter's smile was from ear to ear! Thank you for the amazing service ladies, y'all made our day! We will be back again for the delicious donuts and the best service!"}
{"text":"This morning I called before LaMar's opened and put in an order for my team at work; four dozen donuts. When I got there the donuts were ready and the gentleman working the counter remembered my name and had everything ready for me. I was in there maybe two minutes! He even helped carry out my order to my car. It was the best customer experience I've had in a long time, if ever! Definitely made my early morning 10x better. Sometimes a smile and a small gesture like carrying donuts out to someone's car can really make a strangers day!"}
{"text":"This pace never fails to have delicious. I used to love coming here. The service used to be great and then donuts were on point. Now, when I give reviews I take into consideration customer service and the food. For me, customer service is number one. The food can be a ok, but the service can make that three to five and if the food is bomb with alright service it can go from a 5 to a 3. This review is based on my last experience at this place. I went in and got my fave, maple bar and a few other kinds for my co-workers. I believe I have left my wallet at the location and I called around 1pm and asked if I had left it there. The guy who answered the phone, laughed at me! And said, no wallet. He. Laughed. At. Me. For what?! To me, that was uncalled for. Turned that delicious 5 star rating if delicious donuts down to a 3 star rating and a me not coming back."}
{"text":"Donut heaven ... what more can I say? Very fresh donuts, warm and friendly staff, spacious and sunny area for sitting and enjoying your bites of heaven while leisurely sipping your coffee. The earlier you come (preferably before 1 pm!), the greater your choices."}
{"text":"These are the best I've had in years I've been all over the country tasting donuts. Perfect review, good staff, friendly, and a dozen only costs 9.99 + tax (11.07). Money well with spent. In fact I'm going to get some more RIGHT NOW! Lol"}
{"text":"I don't usually waste my time writing negative reviews however I am sitting in the Lamar's drive thru line a little irritated. Thomas should not work retail, he seems very irritated with having to even talk to me at this point. They are out of multiple donuts which is fine because it's actually late in the morning, he charged me for the donuts I asked for then kept coming back to the window to tell me they're out of certain donuts. Instead of being apologetic or patient with me making a next choice, he was rude and impatient."}
{"text":"They have the best donuts in the valley, hands-down.  I like the old fashioned donuts best."}
{"text":"Once more I cannot say enough times how amazing the donuts are here.  This time tried the Boston cream with chocolate frosting and without frosting. The chocolate wins hands down. Love it love it         A group of us tried these donuts. AMAZING There is nothing better than the perfect donut and this place has produced the perfect donut  Old fashioned. The best I have tasted  Maple donut. The donut so light and fluffy   Cherry frosted cake donut   Rather dry  German knot. Huge  not to chocolate in taste very similar to a German chocolate cake  Glazed  so light and fluffy it is like  what I would imagine biting into a cloud would be like   Chocolate bar. Not as light as the glazed, but still light  Apple fritter very large  tasted like an apple pie"}
{"text":"Hands down best glazed donuts out there!!! Take some to work, take them home for the kiddos, whatever, just get some and try em!!! Beware, highly addictive!!"}
{"text":"You want to know what kind of coworker I am?  Well I'll tell ya.  Last Monday or Tuesday one of my cohorts started talking about donuts.  Someone had just brought in Bosa donuts, which were fine, but my man L.J. brought up LaMar's and half the room moaned with pleasure.  Oh yeah!  I haven't had a donut from LaMar's in about 6 years, and that was on my honeymoon in Fort Collins, no less.  Yes, donuts on my honeymoon.  We ate a lot of nachos and drank a lot of beer too.  It was awesome.  Anyway, right that second I decided that I was going to get up early and bring in some LaMar's donuts last Friday.  I woke up at 4:00, got dressed with my eyes closed, and hit the road.  I got to LaMar's at 5:32 a.m. and they were already busy.  Three people were inside, 2 cars were in the drive-thru, and the phone was ringing off the hook.  I'm glad I didn't choose the drive-thru because I could hear one of those oblivious morons going \"Uh....ummm....I'll take 3 dozen donuts.  Ummm....4 plain cake donuts and three...no make that 6 glazed donuts....what kind of cake donuts do you have?....OK.  I'll take 3 buttermilk donuts....what flavors do you have in those?....OK.  How many do I have left?\"    Ugh.  Mad Max that woman right out the way! Go inside, dingleberry!  I ordered 2 dozen assorted, with 6 glazed, and a two-tone twist donut for myself.  Excellent service and even more excellent donuts.  I got two big hugs from two handsome men when they got to the office and got a load of those donuts.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous, I find a lot of excuses to drive 20 something miles away.  My Physical therapy is in the Desert Ridge area, so that makes is only 10 miles away, practically next door.  I have been indulging a little bit too much on the maple donuts, my favorite, they are pillowy soft and the frosting is perfectly creamy.  On Tuesdays, they have the orange cake donut, my little boy's favorite.  Good thing I have PT Tuesdays and Thursdays, maybe not?!?!?"}
{"text":"Really frustrated with Lamar's today. I went to order donuts through the drive thru and it was a mess. They got my order wrong numerous times and then ended up charging me more money because they didn't give me the donuts that I order but the ones they had. The three different people I spoke with were very unpleasant and rude. Not going to return after this time"}
{"text":"As much as I love Dunkin Donuts for their iced coffee, their donuts are horrible.  These are the real deal.  If you really want to go over the top, get a Lamar Bar.  It's a chocolate or maple bar filled with white, bavarian, or chocolate cream.  It's fantastic, got be be a 1000 calories but so worth it.  They have heavenly cake donuts too, the kind I remember from years ago, sturdy cake, perfect frosting, sprinkles if you dare.  Service is welcoming and genuine.  I ordered a large decaf coffee and they were just brewing a new pot but it was going to take another 60 seconds so they gave me what they had for no charge (it was almost a full cup). I love it when businesses see the value in taking care of their customers for little to no cost and then gain them as customers for life."}
{"text":"GREAT doughnuts, HORRIBLE coffee. I ordered a medium iced caramel macchiato and received a small cup of cream . I think I would come here more often if the beverages were better."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!  LaMar's Donuts makes donuts like what I grew up eating!  Sometime in the early 1980s, something changed in the donut world, and not for the better.  The donuts just weren't as tasty as they had been.  I remember my best friend and I discussing this on several occasions back then.    Over the years, I started to attribute this to 'growing up' and 'tastes change' (like how when I tried to eat kid's breakfast cereal (Captain Crunch with Crunchberries) after I moved out, it was really disappointing).  Yesterday, we finally went to LaMar's and it shattered that theory.  From the moment I saw the display case, it felt like the donut shops of my youth...they just..looked right...  We ordered an assortment of classics and took our box home.  From the first bite, my donut world was rebooted.  Om'goodness.  Fabulous!  The Bavarian Cream donut had proper cream filling (not the gritty crap Dunkin foists on you).  The donut was light and soft and perfect. Mmmmmmmm.  The cinnamon roll was huge!!!  And - wiping a tear away - perfect.    It's waaaayyyy across town for an early morning drive, but..I WILL be back!!!  Thank you, LaMar's, for restoring true donut wonderfulness to the Valley."}
{"text":"Huge, fantastic, light and fluffy!    That says it all.   I got the long john filled with Bavarian cream ($2.00).  The cream was too sweet for me but the donut was fantastic and bigger than my pocket book.   See pic below.   Great selection and will definitely come and try their other selections.  Easy parking and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer. I love their donuts, especially the fluff filled ones which are just heavenly. They are a little pricey and you have to be careful with what you are ordering because some donuts cost more than others, but as a rare treat they are so worth it.  The store itself is bright and clean and the staff is friendly. They have a drive-thru and a selection of coffees and juices as well. They also offer a stamp card for a free dozen after so many visits."}
{"text":"Lamar's truly makes the best donuts. An Awesome variety to make your way through. Every visit the staff is super friendly and helpful.  Taste is there number one priority. Each donut has a distinct flavor, and perfectly cooked. The icing is flavorful and correct. A lot of donut shops in town, but no others like this."}
{"text":"I adore Lamars, but they run out of donuts almost every Sunday. By the time we get there at 10:30-11 am, its slim selection. If this happens every week, you should know that you need make more donuts! Still...the quality is so yummy - apple fritters and lamars bars are the best!"}
{"text":"Alyssa gave us great customer service! Hope when we come back, she will help us again :)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Yelp brought us together, Lamar's! We complete each other.  Soo, I love donuts. Like, LOVE LOVE LOVE them. So much. There's 1 place by my house that is just okay so we decided to go for a little drive to Lamar's.  It was about 10am on a Sunday & the place was packed, but luckily for us, so were the cases! Yay! The line moved crazy fast & I kinda panicked & just quickly threw out some flavors & she boxed them up. We tried a glazed maple, orange glazed, lemon glazed & a chocolate glazed.  I guess I didn't realize how big these babies really are! When we got home, okay, I'm lying...when I got to the car I ate the lemon one & it was pure donut bliss! Mmmmmmm! So fluffy & fresh. I may or may not of also eaten the maple one before I made it home.  They were THAT good."}
{"text":"Lamar's donuts came very highly recommended by a coworker so my boss brought some to the office for everyone to try.  My favorite go-to donut is the Boston Cream so I decided to sample that one first.  It was good but tasted like a Boston Cream donut from just about anywhere else.  It wasn't until after I tried the Boston Cream that I was told about how the chocolate glazed were the real special ones.  So I gave that one a shot and WOW.... it actually was very very good and dare I say outstanding.  Crispy cream and Dunkin can suck it!"}
{"text":"They're donuts are really good and they're huge ! Service is pretty fast too. They're a little pricey but it's worth it !"}
{"text":"LaMar's is my go-to spot for fresh made daily donuts! Even more so - they are so kind and do not hesitate to give to a good cause. They donated donuts to our elementary school for our Donuts with Dads day, and they were absolutely phenomenal! We appreciate all their love and kindness and would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in Arizona. The staff is so incredibly friendly. I wanted a different filling in one of the donuts and the gentleman helping me said \"no problem I can get that for you just let me go to the back and I will have a few filled for you\" the Lamars bars are so delicious. Actually all of their donuts are to die for. And they are so reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Most friendly donut shop ever! Our first time here and we were bewildered by the choices. The ladies were so helpful and kind by our indecision. The \"specialties\" are a little pricey at $1.89 each but they are HUGE! Can't wait to rip into these guys. They also have a few samples out to help you decide."}
{"text":"Five stars for sure! This place is amazing. We ordered a manager'a special box so we got to choose a bunch of their special donuts and pair them with some of their cake donuts. All amazing. The Lamar's bars are perfect. Not too much stuff inside and the perfect amount of chocolate on the outside! Even their coffee is amazing. Would choose here over Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme anyday! Price is great as well!"}
{"text":"i love you lamar whoever you are. Discovered these donuts after a co-worker brought a box of a dozen or so into the office.  I couldn't stop myself and am embarassed to admit i ate 3 and probably would've had another if they hadn't disappeared. think the coworkers thought i was eating for two as they laughed in disbelief that all 100lbs of me didn't even bother making excuses. didn't care as i was in heaven. homer simpson wouldve gone mad for these and i'm still kicking myself for not saving 1 for later. If i ate 2 or 3 of the krispy or dunkin i probably would've keeled over.  These donuts look like generic supermarket ones but after you bite into them you realize krispy kreme and dunkin are no match.  There's only 1 location in Arizona but if you love donuts you've got to try these."}
{"text":"Seriously, THE best donuts. Perfectly baked, decorated, and a huge variety of styles and flavors.   They are pretty much always busy, but they handle the flow of customers well. I've always experienced friendly customer service and never had a bad donut. The only thing that can bring me down is when they are out of my favorites. This happens at times because their donuts are amazing and people buy them in multiple dozens at a time. So, it's best to go on the early side if you can. Oh, and ask about their punchcard. You can earn a free dozen and they have at least one double stamp day."}
{"text":"By far, the best donuts I've had in the valley. Fresh and delicious at a reasonable price, and the donuts are pretty darn big as well. They had a pretty good variety as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Their donuts are amazing! I had the dusted blueberry filled donut and the chocolate filled chocolate glazed donut and loved them both!!   Reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was for service. When we walked in and were ready to order, there were two workers in the store. One was sweeping the floor and the other just sitting in the corner. We made eye contact with the one that wasn't doing anything and he just ignored us - didn't get up to take our order or let the other person know that we were waiting... O_o"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a busy Saturday morning and the place was packed. We almost left, but we didn't even wait 3 minutes before it was our turn to order.   The staff was ridiculously friendly and the man helping us was very patient with my indecisive kids.   The donuts are consistently delicious at Lamar's, but I hopped on here to write a review based on my customer service experience, which was stellar. Great job training your staff, Lamar's!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a rewarding donut in this city , and by rewarding I mean , that taste that brings back all the memories I associate with donuts.  As a child growing up in Orange County, Ca., we had not only Winchells donuts but Mom and  Pop joints that  were usually ran by a sweet Asian family who knew how to make a great donut. You'd find them on almost every corner. From my earliest donut memories of stopping for donuts on the way to church or mom buying donuts for birthday party  , or later when donuts provided me comfort during my parents divorce to the fun of buying a dozen donuts on the way home from a wild college night , donuts have  been there for me , like my own sacred rite of passage thru my life.  Okay that might be stretching it a bit.. but donuts are chocked with memories for me .  So the anticipation was high as I decided on my sick day to stop for a comforting donut or two at Lamars. When I walked in I hoped that somehow a little ole lady would come out from behind the counter but no instead I ordered from the local chain  .  The first donut was an old fashioned , it tasted like it was right off of  memory lane , sweet but not sickening, great dough , lightly iced. I was taken back to every yummy donut I ever adored... Great!  I made my second  donut an old favorite , pink iced cake donut ..here is where it all went horribly wrong .. the donut tasted dry ,over cooked,with a gaggy sweet non distinguishable icing...the horror...  Well if you love donuts go to La mars maybe it was an off day for the frosted pink donut..and make sure to have a old fashioned donut for me.."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place by sharing a donut with me a while back. The donut was SO good! I drove 45 minutes to get fresh ones yesterday, and it was worth it! The young lady who helped me with my 2 dozen donuts (wanted to give back to those who had shared with me) was nice and chose a good variety! The shop was busy (a good sign), and there were several varieties to choose from. I ate a Bavarian creme filled with chocolate icing donut right away!! It was delicious. Difficult to describe how a donut can be dense and light at the same time, but it is. It doesn't have the same grease/oil content. It was warm and so tasty!! Not skimpy on the filling either! Worth the drive. Lamar's is so good!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts!!!  They're huge!  Didn't care for the fruit smoothies at all...too watery and had to be remade.  Won't order again, but will definitely come back for the delicious donuts!"}
{"text":"Beat donuts in town and the staff is friendly . Double punches for dozens purchased on Mondays and Tuesday's!!!"}
{"text":"Lamar's Donuts has the tastiest donuts I've ever had!! The store is very clean and they have a large donut selection. They have lots of coffee selections as well.  This donut shop is a must try. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong.  If you have an early meeting or other morning event, you can't go wrong if you bring donuts from LaMar's. The donuts at LaMar's  are delicious and practically melt in your mouth. LaMar's offers a large selection of donuts to choose from.  The cinnamon twists are huge, light and fluffy, as are the glazed donuts. LaMar's offers filled bismarks, cake donuts with all types of toppings and of course donut holes.   The focus at LaMar's is on flavor and quality ingredients of the donuts. Therefore, the price per donut is a little higher than other donut places, however, these donuts are worth the price. The staff at LaMar's are great. The service is quick, and the staff are willing to accomdate whatever you want. I definitely recommend Lamars to everyone."}
{"text":"I had the \"fluff\" filled donut. No hyperbole... Best donut I've ever had. I wish they had these in California. The service was great. The cashier knew a lot about the donuts. The place was very clean."}
{"text":"Good doughnuts if you can get there before they are gone...  I figured I would go threw the drive thru since inside was empty also.  Omg biggest mistake!! Sat at the intercom for a good while and when the worker named Dasia finally answered she told me to hold... A while later I said hello again.. She replied with one sec plz.  Another while later she was finally ready to take my order.  Idk what took so long when their only customers were me and a guy inside :/   so the best part of all this is she sold the last glaze doughnut to the guy that walked in while I was waiting to place my order.  Good doughnuts but horrible customer service.  Best tip... Make sure you have time to kill if you go threw the drive thru."}
{"text":"The only reason I can give this place even one star is the donuts IF they have them are actually very good... But it all ends there!  To be fair,  I arrive (between 930-10) typically after the morning rush, today was the 5th time I have tried this place.  They have NOT EVEN ONCE had the donuts I wanted to order!! Today we wanted 3blueberry, they had one.  I ordered a chocolate and a cinnamon roll... Simple right?? I didn't get the cinnamon roll!! Of course I didn't notice till I had drove off and noticed I got something else... Over the last 6years I have gone there 5times, only out of convenience.  First time,  I received an entirely undrinkable iced coffee.  After a few visits,  that were only marred by a lack of inventory,  I tried the iced coffee again thinking that it really couldn't be that bad... IT IS!! Apparently I wasn't the only one,  I was one of two people that had parked to go inside to get a refund for the drink!! I can understand the 5star reviews if all these people went here once and we're lucky enough to get what they ordered... BUT FIVE TIME IN A ROW, this place has failed miserably!! I can't imagine how they have this score!!"}
{"text":"I don't know who LaMar is, but he needs to know I love his doughnuts! OMG! Thank you for doing this the right way! This place is in a league of its own! Your doughnuts have my heart!"}
{"text":"Probably the best donut place in Phoenix! Donuts are huge!   Blue berry donut: really good! It has a good sweetness to it!  Red Velvet donut: bomb! It does have icing on it and I was hesitate at first because red velvet can be sweet; however, when I tried it, like the blue berry donut, it was perfect! Who isn't a fan of red velvet?  I will definitely be going back here again!"}
{"text":"The best cake donuts I have ever had in my entire lifetime. Always fresh, I would say that these donuts are the best in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Truly the best doughnuts I've ever had.  Not hyperbole because I've never said that before.  Love this place even if they spell 'doughnuts' wrong.  :-)  For the most part, I actually HATE doughnuts.  I got over that aversion after eating a LaMar's old fashioned while waiting for an oil change at the car dealership.  The doughnuts were killer so I asked them where they get them.  They told me LaMar's just up Bell Road.  You haven't lived until you've had a LaMar's doughnut. Yeah, they're that good.  They're worth a splurge.  They worth buying a dozen and eating half yourself.  Most doughnuts you'll buy are greasy.  I usually get heartburn from doughnuts but not from the delicacies at LaMar's.  They make them in-house and yes, if you don't wrap them overnight, they will be hard and stale the next day.  Guess what that means?  No preservatives.  They're fresh daily and made from real stuff, not preservatives and \"dough softeners\".  No wonder they taste so good and go down like silk.  If LaMar's wasn't a drive for me, I'd be 200 pounds.  Love, love these doughnuts."}
{"text":"It's a good thing I'm really not a morning person because I usually think about going to Lamar's in the afternoon and  Thank God! they are already closed. :) They have the best maple glazed bar with custard filling EVER. The fritters are the size of a plate. One star off for the coffee, though, it's just not as good as DD's."}
{"text":"Well i hate to be the bearer of bad news...but these doughnuts are average at best. My co-workers bring some in to work about twice a week and each time they taste the same to me. The doughnuts have to much dough so to speak...and quite frankly they are really to big to enjoy as a doughnut. The last time i checked doughnuts should be a joy to eat...not a chore. I think i will stick to my Krispy Cremes if you don't mind my fellow yelpers. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Best donuts and amazing smiley people to start your morning out with  u should try it out worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding donuts... honestly the best in the valley for the \"classic\" donut.  They're a bit pricey, but that isn't to say they aren't worth it. Make sure you get a punch card so a future dozen can be free."}
{"text":"LaMar's is actually awesome. I feel like I hear about places in the valley that people tell me have great donuts and, upon tasting, discover that they're just good. Just being better than the supermarket donuts isn't enough and kudos to LaMar's because their delicious, soft, fresh donuts are the only way to go.   Jenny suggested LaMar's when we had to bring a couple dozen donuts to an event. When we walked in, I was impressed at their selection and presentation. We got our assorted boxes and, what can I say, the LaMar's was a hit at our event!   I'd say LaMar's is definitely worth it and I will be back.  Oh -- their coffee isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Happy Monday Yelpers! What a great way to start a work week but with LaMar's donuts waiting in the office in the morning on Monday!  Someone kind went there early in the morning and waited a long line to get these. Their donuts are huge, fluffy inside, not too sweet, not greasy. I don't normally eat donuts, it's not on my diet but when I saw LaMar's donuts, aroma from the box was so inviting, I ended up eating two!  I know, I ate two donuts.  LaMar's donuts on Monday morning, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"I know lots of people love LaMar's, and they have a drive through, so I'll give them that. HOWEVER I waited behind ONE person in the drive with a seemingly small order (1 small bag) through for over 10 minutes. No thanks! I could have parked and run in and out faster than that!  Their apple fritter is pretty unique in that it's thin and flat.... but not what I want when I'm looking for a fritter. I'll continue to head to Bosa or Rainbow for my cheap donut fix!"}
{"text":"These are the largest most spectacular donuts I've ever come across... and I'm Canadian, so I know! :)  The specialty donuts are all just incredible creations and about 50% bigger than what I'm used to. The box for a dozen is about double the standard size, and for good reason!  Join the frequent customer club and get a free dozen after the purchase of 10. Monday's and Tuesday's are double stamp days!!!"}
{"text":"Best donut ever. I have to keep myself away or I will gain 60 lbs. So much better than Duncan and a little better than kk. Coffee is terrible."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts! This is the second time I've visited LaMar's and it's been perfect both times. The donuts are large! They are perfectly soft and non-greasy.  Great customer service too and a convenient drive through."}
{"text":"Ordered one hot coffee, one ice coffee, and a single donut.  All went down hill when the iced coffee looked like iced tea.  When it was handed to me via the drive through window, it seemed to be overfilled and spilled in my center console.  Not the end of the world.  Next we were handed the hot coffee..  ouch .. the lid would not stay secure so we spilled even more in the center console.  Spending money to essentially throw out the drinks was a bummer.  Stick to the donuts here and keep some burn cream at the ready."}
{"text":"There donut gotta love them freshly made every morning . Employees and employer are some of the nicest people"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE donut fan and I have the belly to prove it. I've tried Rainbow, Bosa and Golden Donuts since I recently moved here and none of them come anywhere close to how good this place is. I actually drive 45 min each way sometimes on a Saturday morning just because they're that much better than anything else that I've had in the valley.  Lemon Bismark was phenomenal! Best lemon-fill I've ever had in my life! It's huge and fresh and the powdered sugar is layered on well too. Cinnamon twist was also the best I've ever had. You could taste fresh cinnamon in the bread and the glaze was perfect. The cake donuts are big and they put lots of frosting on them. I could go on and on but you get the idea. Make the drive out to Lamars if you like donuts. If you think Krispy Kreme is a good donut then you're beyond help anyways.  NOTE TO ARTEMIS-People go to Yelp to hear people's reviews on food that they actually taste. If you want to give your opinion on the dangers of hydrogenated oils then go take a nutrition class and write a book report so everyone can be wowed by your knowledge. I go here to find good food, not get a lecture about what I \"should\" be eating. One star for a food you never even tried? What a joke."}
{"text":"So good the glaze, cherry cake and the double chocolate is so good. Better then Dunkin donuts and Krispy Kreme is ok only good when fresh and warm ."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about this shop and I actually tried a donut last year from a coworker that brought some in. Luckily I live close by and decided to get a bakers dozen with an assortment of donuts. The variety of the donuts is amazing and the flavors is like no other ! If you are in the bell road and I-17 area come check out this amazing donut shop!"}
{"text":"Went over to a friend's house yesterday and on the counter was a pretty bakery box with the words LaMar's on it.  Just from the box alone I knew there was something special inside. Curiosity was grabbing a hold of me quickly, had to see what was in that box, I asked my friend and he said go ahead and look, and man I was shocked to see that inside that box was donuts and not just donuts I am taking huge beautiful donuts and they were not in a normal pink donut box. He told me to go ahead and have one, but I really think he said that because at this point I was drooling LOL . There was an assortment of donuts, but I am a big maple lover so I went ahead and got the maple iced donut. Let me tell you this was donut bliss!!!! I used to think BoSa was the best donut joint in town, but they have a run for their money, LaMar's just might be the one!  Now I just have to make it over to LaMars myself!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Incredibly light and airy donuts at reasonable prices. There are so many different kinds to pick from, you can't go wrong with any of them. I'm a sucker for a traditional glazed donut. I'm not a fan of chocolate glazed donuts but theirs is worth it!   PS: They only bake once a day, so get there early!"}
{"text":"I love LaMar's Donuts. They have some of the best donuts and coffee around. The employees  always provide excellent customer service. They are friendly, fast and efficient as there is usually a line of cars in the drive thru and inside a line of customers.  The donuts are fresh and bigger than the other donut stores. They are a little more in price but the size and quality is what you are paying for. I have not ever been disappointed by them. I have been going to LaMar's for 10 years. I am a repeat and loyal customer."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Phoenix hands down! We go every Saturday and love them!  Get there early because they close when they run out of donuts!"}
{"text":"Okay seriously lamars donuts is the shit! I always get two dozen donuts and a shit load of of donut holes and they're gone within the hour!!! If you haven't yet you gotta check this place out"}
{"text":"Allow me to set the scene...  Driving up to Lake Pleasant on a lovely Sunday morning; 5 excited friends chugging along on the 17.  The driver of our vehicle mentions his hunger and we all quickly agree that we too are hungry, because, you know, it's rare for people to be hungry at the same time, let alone on a Sunday morning.  He then goes on to suggest or demand (depending on hunger level) that he wants donuts.   Being the tech savvy group that we are, we all bust out our phones like Quick Draw McGraw to search for the nearest donut place, hoping that we haven't passed something up already.  Opening up the Yelp app and furiously typing in \"donuts\" in the search box, the first result I get is Lamar's Donuts & Coffee.  I quickly clicked on the map and wouldn't you know it, we are barreling towards it at 65 miles an hour & we'd be needing to exit within the next minute.  Shouting out \"I found one! Exit on Bell!\" our dear driver exits and proceeds to turn onto Bell road.    We are all so excited that we found a donut place that quickly and that close to us that we might as well have just skipped on into the building holding hands and whistling a light-hearted showbiz tune.  As soon as we set foot in this donut aroma-filled heaven, do our jaws do a figurative drop and the drooling commences.  Setting our eyes upon the rows of amazing looking donuts, we started randomly saying \"I want that!\" \"oooh, I want that one too.\" etc.    Kristi was there to greet us and asked how our morning was.  Without hesitation we all agreed that we wanted a dozen of these delectable donuts.  Kristi goes on to tell us about the Manager's special and which donuts apply to that.  One in our group asks for a clarification on the word \"donut\" as it pertains to the Manager's special.  Awesome Kristi, quickly said sarcastically \"The ones with the holes in the middle are donuts.\"  We all had a laugh and ribbed the obviously stupid question, but all in good fun.    Kristi offers us samples of donut holes and, my goodness...what amazing little treats those were. After we made our selections; a couple long johns, several butter reams, glazed etc., we then realized we needed beverages to help us wash down these dreamy donuts.  They have a great selection of coffee and lattes alike.  I noticed chai is on the board and, Kristi, being fantabulous, told us that she can make any Starbucks drink there and that she was quite the superstar.  Without a second thought I asked if she could make a iced chai and she said she could!  Within minutes she had dished out our drinks.  Now comes to the payment....  We all saddle up to the checkout and Kristi rings up our order and it came to about $27 total..  I only had a $10 on me and everyone in our group just awkwardly looked at each other, seemingly thinking \"I hope he/she pays this.\" Two proceed to pull out cash and then, verrrry slowly, a third pulls out his wallet.  Lamar's sure knows how to hire them; Kristy picked on the third member of our group with a quip that he pulled out his wallet way too slow and that he did that on purpose so as not to have to help pay.  All of us gave one of those ,\"ooooooooh!!! Dude she burned you!!\" and the like. She didn't let up either, the jokes kept coming from all angles and needless to say it gave us that extra kick in our step to continue to start the day off on the right foot.  We all said our tearful goodbyes to Lamar's and promised that we'd be back soon. Parting is such sweet sorrow.  Hopping in the car to start our journey to Lake Pleasant again, the donuts immediately filled the entire car with their scent and again, our drooling began. It was like reliving the first time we walked into Lamar's, that happened a whopping 15 minutes ago; but it felt like a lifetime instead. Whipping open the box, we were all given our donuts of choice and then silence fell upon the car.  No one spoke a word, but instead we let out occasional \"mmmmm\"'s as we all enjoyed and savored these fabulous treats.    So rich, so creamy, so perfect.  Thank you Lamar's and Yelp for bringing us to this temple for donuts.  If you haven't gone before, you must go immediately!!! Kristi was fabulous and I wish more people were like her; it made our morning that much more enjoyable and we will definitely be back! You rock!  End."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Lamar's, but it was Mediocre for me. I gave 3 stars for friendly staff, soft donuts, clean establishment. It was just missing taste."}
{"text":"Although alittle pricy, these are the best donutes on earth and are hugh. How in the heck we got one somewhere near  me and not in Scottsdale, or PV, is a shocker. Located just off the I-17 freeway and Bell Rd. worth the trip."}
{"text":"Well, I can't review this as Lamars, but this place used to be a little sandwich shop with the cutest little train themes. According to my fiancee, it's the same cook, and he will make anything from the old menu. So maybe this is the review for the cook.. but it is absolutely delicious! Try all of them, but my fave is the pulled pork.. don't remember what it was called.. some sort of train name. Mention it, they'll know what yer sprayin'!"}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars very often...but if you are a donut connoisseur like myself, then you must try Lamar's. There is nothing fancy about this place, but their boxes put it in the best way, \"Simply a better donut.\" I even like Krispy Kreme donuts, but Lamar's is more of a good old fashioned donut. Personally I love the Maple Lamars Bar...but that is because I am a sucker for maple donuts!  Also, this place has a drive through, so if you wake up in the morning and don't feel like getting out of your pajamas you can just hit up the drive through at Lamar's and pick up some tasty donuts!"}
{"text":"Lamar's has just surpassed Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek Rd. as the best donuts I've had in Phoenix. All the donuts are fresh and there are many varieties. Many are freaking gigantic, but they do have normal sized-donuts, too! Their coffee is pretty good for this kind of restaurant. Reminded me of the standard Starbuck's offering. I'd get it again, but wouldn't go there JUST for the coffee. Clean, cute store and friendly, helpful staff makes this a good bet for brekky sweets!"}
{"text":"Donuts are 5 stars.   Coffee is 5 stars. No almond milk though.  Service is 1 star.  The counter workers are overworked, clearly stressed and it shows up in their attitudes.  Each time I go, the drive-thru rarely works. I ended up waiting 15 minutes this morning because the lady forgot I was there.  I don't like going inside because it is not very clean."}
{"text":"Okay... I asked my dear husband to find me \"a really, really, really large glazed donut. Like, large.\" Happily one of his coworkers recommended LaMar's, and Husband came home with a decadent warm apple fritter the size of my head.  If you are pregnant, you need to come here. If your wife is pregnant, you need to come here for her. This has got to be the best donut I have had in years. Their takeaway boxes are cute, too."}
{"text":"Fresh puffy donuts my friend had three, oh boy. Coffee was great too. Most of the time a line, but moves fast. Will go again when in the area."}
{"text":"I order several dozen of Lamar's Donuts every year for my kids birthdays.  They are seriously some of the best donuts I've ever had.  You have not lived if you haven't tried Lamar's!  Love that its an old school donut shop, too.  Most definitely worth a visit and the preferred \"sweet\" for birthday celebrations in our house."}
{"text":"So it's National Donut Day, and everybody in Arizona is in this Donut shop. The donuts are so fresh! And the staff is super patient and friendly!"}
{"text":"Well, after years and years of hearing how good Lamar's is, I finally was able to get to that part of town at the right time.  Everyone was right, delicious doughnuts!  Very warm and inviting seating area.  The place looked super clean also, which is high on my list.  Friendly and knowledgable staff.  Can't wait to go back.  Happy with the good value of product to price."}
{"text":"Really great doughnuts and coffee per reviews and crowds. I prefer better variety (they didn't have great selection of old-fashioned style, and no chocolate-glazed old-fashioned which is wife's favorite). Apple fritter was huge but thin (but good). Coffe good but way HOT. Burned lip and tongue and no styro cups or sleeves for decaf coffee were disappointing but what they had was very good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and my experience both times have been awesome. The girls at the drive thru were very nice and patient, and the donuts are AMAZING!!!! I like the regular donuts over the cake ones. The donut holes are so good and cheap! It's like less than $2 for a dozen.  Their donuts are so soft and fluffy and delicious...and they're huge!! Mmmm.. Yum.  I've shared them with my boyfriend, his coworkers, my coworkers, and everyone who's tried them loved them too. And better yet, it's on my way to work!!"}
{"text":"The best donuts in Phoenix hands down. The only place I get donuts from is LaMar's donuts. If you haven't tried it you must go and get the blueberry donut."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love a fresh baked donut?! Lamars are light, fluffy, and fresh every day making it worth any wait you may encounter. My ultimate favorite is the two tone knot, a delectable twist of plain and chocolate donut twisted together into one giant knot of lightly glazed fluffy goodness. This popular delicacy runs out quickly though so you have to get there early to grab one up! By far the best shop in town."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp while I was visiting Phoenix.  I am a Doo-Nut fiend, so was looking for a place.  Lamar's was middle of the road.  I am a classic glazed donut kind of guy and I love them even more when they are hot and fresh.  I think had I been there when the donuts were hot and fresh I would've enjoyed them more.  Yet, it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"My coworkers had brought Lamar's in on several different occasions, and I had enjoyed them every time.  Today when I went in to work, the coworkers were feeling Donutty, and I was volunteered to be the buyer of today's dozen.  Rolled on down, and they had a drive through. I really wasn't feeling the menu and nobody talked to me anyways, so I pulled thru. Glad I did.  Parked, went into a nice clean store with a dizzying array of large delicious looking donuts. Yum.   The lady that helped me was very nice and she served me up my dozen to go.  My only issue from giving the 5 stars would be the price. Just seemed a few bucks too steep, but hey, I guess it's a rough world and you have to stay in business.  I will likely keep patronizing BoSa regularly, but if you are like a picky BMW driving blonde white soccer mom who maybe BoSa  is a little too scary for, Lamar's is the choice for you."}
{"text":"Donuts were better than Dunkin, but not the best I've had in the valley.  Their selection of yeast donuts is not very big, but they have a variety of cake donuts.  We were disappointed they had no yeast (raised) glazed."}
{"text":"The best donuts in the valley.  I regularly go from Chandler to Prescott and leave so that I can make it by Lamar's just as they open.  Friendly staff, fast in and out.  The plain cake is awesome.  Coffee is average."}
{"text":"So far we haven't had a bad donut from this shop. They are fantastic. They make the BEST Bavarian cream filled long John. Have to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Lamars has the best donuts in the valley, Period.  having had some amazing dounts in the mid-west, this is the place to go if you want your chocolate \"long john\" filled with white frosting, NOT custard (But they have that too).  The cake donuts are great, and the regular donuts are HUGE.  but go ealry, they only make a morning batch and close at 2:00PM.  They are almost completely sold out by 10 AM though."}
{"text":"Since moving to phoenix this is the BEST donut shop I've found ! Don't even bother with Krispy Kreme or Dunkin donuts..  The staff is friendly and smiley , Nice and clean on the inside .. Nice display of FRESH donuts ... Lots of choices and flavors .. They even have a double chocolate donut ! The donut it's self it's nice and airy , not OVERLY sweet , just the right amount of sugar and glaze ;) there's plenty of tables to eat in and a  drive through.  Yum yum yum !!!"}
{"text":"The biggest donuts in the valley. They are super friendly and the coffee is not bad. You gotta see these things!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service! Great variety of donuts and even better, they are scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Great donuts!!!  Unfortunately no wifi as was posted.  Didnt try the coffee, but donuts on point!!  FAVE is the basics... Chocolate raised, cinnamon raised... even yummy the next day!!  Would come back if in the area for donuts..thiught they were better then my fave chain dunkin donuts..  Prices are good.  Location not great, but inside was clean n friendly services.  Wish we had time for the coffee but was on a hunt for free wifi lol.."}
{"text":"Ive been here before but we came on national donut day and the line wasn't too bad but they ran out of donuts really early so we  our free doughnut and only bought a few others because they didn't have that much of a choice at 830-9am.  One of the best donuts you can get"}
{"text":"No complaints here! Fresh, fast and a variety of flavors. Friendly staff. Gotta get here early though because once they're out of donuts they're out till the next day. Prices are higher than dunkin down the street but the donuts here are bigger, tastier and more fresh. You get what you pay for; I've never liked Dunkin much anyway to be honest."}
{"text":"OMG this is the best donut I've found in the Phoenix area since moving down here from Chicago over 10 years ago!!!!  The Bavarian Cream was huge and soft and so good!!!  I haven't had that good of a donut since Chicago!!!  Wowzers.  I wish this place was in the West Valley where I live.  The apple spice donut and double chocolate cake donut were also good, although I like apple cider donuts better and didn't much care for the spice in that one. I'll be back for the Bavarian cream one though!!  Solid!"}
{"text":"Great place, good donuts, I'm not even a donut person.   This place is right across the street from us so it is really convenient for us to get a quick breakfast and some coffee. I usually get the Cinnamon roll cause its the size of a Frisbee and dunk it in coffee.   They have a pretty good selection of donuts and coffee, really beats the hell out of krispy kreme."}
{"text":"My world has been turned upside down, at least in terms of donuts.  I cannot believe I'm raving about a donut shop, but Lamar's really is better than anywhere else.  The most delicious morning sweet treats in the valley!  The more traditional \"donuts with a hole\" are 89 cents.  About the same as any donut shops.  The \"specialty donuts\" are $1.89, which may seem expensive, except they're the size of at least two donuts.  One is more than enough for anybody.  Oh, and for the reviewer who is complaining about hydrogenated oils...  It's a donut.  It's bad for you either way.  Might as well use whatever makes it taste best."}
{"text":"Service was great, even on a busy Saturday morning, and there was a wide variety available.  Doughnuts were decent - certainly not bad, but not stellar.  Because we chose mostly specialty doughnuts, the total was just over $25.  A little too steep for just 'decent' doughnuts."}
{"text":"I thought I had doughnuts before. These things put everything I've ever had to shame. They are big and very tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best donut place around!Love it here My family and I go regularly its great!"}
{"text":"Well the other day I was watching Travel station and they had a special about Donuts.  Lamar's was featured on the show and there was a statement that Lamar's was the best donut in the country.  Even won a taste test from police officers and fire fighters!  Then my cousin told me that Lamar's had a location here in Phoenix!  I never knew.    We visited on a Monday late morning around 11am and they still have a good selection of donuts.  We ordered the bavarian cream long john and a orange cream donut.  Both were awesome!  I really liked the bavarian cream!  I wish I could try more, but both were filling.  Overall Lamar's was really good.  The location was nice and spacious.  I would love to come back and next time order a bunch of donuts. We were on our way to a road trip to northern AZ so that's the reason why we didn't get a chance to try more."}
{"text":"I love these donuts! They are always fresh and they all are so delicious. I don't live by here but I've been coming here for years. The staff are all friendly, I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"The donuts are beautiful to behold.  At 11 am there was still a fantastic selection.    However, I really like a dense donut option.  The double chocolate (chocolate cake with chocolate frosting) was very airy.  That might be your cup of tea, but it's not mine.  Unique taste - almost a sourdough flavor.    Overall great donuts, clean store, great selection, super friendly staff."}
{"text":"So this is a real local favorite donut shop. A mom and pop place that is loved by the community. My parents have been going here for years, and the other day my mom went to buy donuts for my sons birthday breakfast... she bought 7regular donuts and 4specialty donuts, the total was about $15.00. When paying for the donuts, she asked for a punch on her donut loyalty card. It was at this time that the young kid behind the counter very rudely told my mom that she didn't purchase a \"dozen\" donuts, and that's not the deal for the punch card. My mom then presumed to explain that a dozen regular donuts is cheaper than what she actually purchased, and that they normally give it without a problem. The kid still wouldn't give it to her. I know this seems silly, but the owners of this place should make sure their customers are treated well. Especially if you've been coming here for years. I'm sure we will still go to lamars... but seriously, why alienate a customer for something so small? Maybe make the punch a dollar amount instead, or just explain to the carefree teenagers what customer service means...? Thanks"}
{"text":"I finally tried Lamar's after my friend's regular Facebook posts about this place.  He was right.  The donuts are fabulous.  Much more fresh tasting than Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme.  They have two sizes of donuts.  We tried the larger ones and they were so good!  The double chocolate donut is like a chocolate glazed donut with chocolate topping.  My favorite.  Only downside is the larger donuts were $1.89 a piece so I couldn't buy as many as I like.  We will definitely be back for a yummy weekend treat.  5 fabulous stars for this joint!"}
{"text":"Yummy donuts! I have been here a couple times and never been disappointed with their donuts. I just wish the staff was more friendlier. I almost feel rushed to buy my donuts and anytime I have asked for some insight, they seem like not interested in explaining. Once I got a friendly employee and it made all the difference.   So here is my insight, the Rays chocolate is yummy and its very fluffy vs the chocolate glazed which is more cake-like and dense. The Bavarian cream is delicious, just get to those donuts early, they sell fast. If it's the season for pumpkin spice definitely give that a try, comes with cream cheese. Their old fashioned Cronut is crunchy and cake-like, also recommended.   Didn't care much for the lemon filled or the rainbow sprinkles. Give the donuts a try, won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We got there later in the day so the donuts were not hot and fresh.  We got 6 glazed and 6 assorted cake donuts and they were still pretty good for being about 1 hr old.  The plain glazed are good, soft dough, and the glazing on top could have been thicker. I like the thicker glaze on my donuts, so when you bite into it it has a little crunch and the soft doughy inside. I tried the chocolate donut and that was soft and tasty too.   I will try to go there again to see if we can some hot and fresh donuts."}
{"text":"I tried Lamar's Donuts today as part of free donut day. And now I feel quite bad for not paying for the donut. They are huge and delicious! These are hands down my favorite donuts......and donuts are my weakness!"}
{"text":"Lamars started in Kansas City Missouri awesome donuts reminds me of being home go get them donuts you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Found this place my second day in Phoenix. My dad and I split a few donuts, buttermilk, old fashioned sour cream, and German chocolate. The old fashioned sour cream was probably my favorite, so flavorful but not overly sweet. Same with the German chocolate which was my fathers fave. Coffee was excellent and super hot! Will be back soon for sure!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, honestly some of the best donuts I have ever had, but there's a reason I cannot give them more than one star and it is because of the way they operate the business.   I have lost count now of how many times I show up 1, 2, 3 hours before closing and they are picked clean. That, in and of itself, I can forgive. But showing up and finding the chairs already up on the tables and the floors being cleaned more than an hour before closing? Talk about spitting in your customer's face. I used to ask myself, why even let people in the door if you're not interested in selling anything past noon-ish?   Got my answer today. Showed up at 1:15pm, found the door locked, chairs up on the tables, signage turned off. Employee was cleaning the drive-thru intercom/display and another guy walked by the windows inside, so obviously the employees were there. I guess they figured they were low enough on donuts that they didn't want to work a full shift or something.  I'm sorry but if I drive halfway across town thinking I for once have a chance to reach the store before it closes, and then over 45 minutes before closing, you lock the doors and give me the finger? Sorry, but there's no way you're getting anything but a 1-star review after that. You're only open until 2pm and you can't even make that work? Come on.   Will I go back? Yeah, maybe if I'm in the neighborhood when they open, but apparently they don't stock enough product, don't stay open for the full published operating ours and don't even have the decency to at least sell drinks and their other merchandise until the actual closing time.   Shame on you for locking your customers out almost an hour before closing because of your own inability to properly stock product and your desire to go home early for the day. What a bunch of lazy bums."}
{"text":"Donuts, donuts, lots of donuts!!  My brother in law kept raving about Lamar's, so we ducked in here on a Sunday afternoon. The donuts are HUGE. Now my experience of donuts, is pretty fantastic. I'm a big lover of donuts. My favorite of course, are my east coast tried and true Dunkin Donuts. Not Phoenix dunkin, but NJ DD.  These are pretty similar to the size of DD from back home. I had the chocolate frosted which were very very tasty. They had a nice selection, as well as donut holes and espresso drinks. I had the white chocolate mocha iced-it was good.  Not much for ambiance, but it was fine for picking up a dozen and going on our merry way.  This place is good! Wish they were open later, but it just means I need to crawl out of bed and get there before 2!"}
{"text":"For a person who rarely eats donuts I've had a Lamar Donut, a Bosa Donut and a Dunkin Donut all this month. I bought a dozen, assorted frosted donuts for my co-workers last weekend. I ordered a apple fritter for myself. I can't comment on the other donuts because I didn't try one.  Now on to my apple fritter. What Bosa and Lamar's apple fritter have in common is the lack of apple. It's a good fritter, but I wouldn't call it an apple fritter. Also, Lamar's fritter is giant in size compared to it's competitors. If I'm craving a fritter and i'm in the area I'll stop in otherwise, I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"So amazing. This place is great. Donuts just melt in your mouth. Pretty busy in the mornings and CRAZY busy weekends."}
{"text":"By far the BEST cake donut I have ever had. The store manager, Richard, is amazing to work with and runs a great shop. If you are ever in LaMar's neighborhood I would suggest stopping by!"}
{"text":"Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I can never wake up early enough to get a dozen of my favorite chocolate fluff-filled donuts. By 10am, they only had 2 chocolate fluff-filled bars left. I was stuck behind a customer who was ordering two dozen donuts. I was crossing my fingers that he didn't get the last 2 chocolate fluff-filled bars. Plan B would be to kindly ask the workers to put some chocolate filling into the unfilled bars, which they often do upon request.  Luckily, my wishes came true and I went home with my 2 chocolate fluff-filled and some bavarian cream bars - my favorites. The donut bars are large, so I like to cut them in half. It's perfect for sharing with someone else if I'm feeling guilty about eating a whole donut to myself.    They also have a good selection of coffee iced/hot. I had their small iced caramel macchiato, which was pretty good. The moral of the story is the earlier you go, the better. They will run out of your favorite donuts. If you go one hour before closing, your selection is pretty limited."}
{"text":"The BEST donuts in town!!  Large in size and always fresh.  They also have fresh brewed iced tea and a nice sitting area to eat in.  They do close too early at 2PM"}
{"text":"You know you've entered a great donut shop when the smell of fresh donuts hits you as you open the door. Unfortunately, that is not this place. It smells like cleaner and the donuts are cold. I wouldn't go back. They're about the same quality as Safeway."}
{"text":"Lamar Bar - I don't what they put in them Lamar Bars that makes them melt in your mouth...but they are awesome. Devils Food Donut - My wife \"suggests\" I drive the 10 miles to get her one whenever she has the urge. Apple Fritter - not as good. Coffee - forget about it."}
{"text":"Best cake donuts I've had anywhere. And I'm old and have travel full time so I've seen my share. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and love the Winchell's Donuts that I grew up with. I tried Dunkin and hated them. This morning I was really craving donuts, so I looked up donut shops around my work and got Lamar's. These are the best donuts I have had so far in AZ that resemble Winchell's in Cali."}
{"text":"Tips:  Red Velvet donuts are only on Sundays. Got 5 donuts for ~$6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Great tasting donuts! I'd definitely recommend coming here for your donut fix.  Donuts that I recommend:  Chocolate icing bizmark donut - Very delicious. Just like a Boston Cream Pie in donut form!  Cinnamon Cake Donut - Absolutely delicious, the staff member recommended that I pop this in the microwave for a couple seconds and the deliciousness triples. It's like eating a warm churro!  Double Chocolate - Great for any chocolate lovers out there!  Overall, you really can't go wrong with any of their donuts."}
{"text":"Omg. Best donuts ever. Soft and fluffy. Not oily. I had the Bavarian cream. So yummy. They were stingy on the cream too"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best doughnuts I've ever had, on top of that the service is very friendly as well.  Get there early because they tend to run out fairly quickly, the place always has a steady stream of people coming in and out the door so don't be shocked if you get there around 12  and everything is pretty much picked clean.    Great tasting donuts without any pretension, what you see is what you get.   Lamar's blows the other doughnut joints right out of the water."}
{"text":"These days \"gourmet donuts\" are all the rage and often go wrong, but a classic donut and a classic donut like these could never go wrong.   We ordered a half dozen of donuts and were quite pleased (understatement). The Old Fashioned was light and fluffy and for my first old fashioned, sublime. The Cherry Donut, while a great flavour topping that tasted exactly like cherry was a little too dry for my taste; however, the other three enjoyed it and thought it to be a great cake donut. The German Knot was not too chocolatey and again, airy and fluffy and just delicious. The Maple Donut and the Glazed topped them all - they were fantastic and wow is all I can say.    We also ordered a couple Apple Fritters. The apple flavour was good, you could actually taste the apple in it. Also, the cinnamon was not overwhelming and the pastry was perfect to accompany the apple.  Truth is, it's \"simply a better donut\". Their slogan is very accurate."}
{"text":"First time I had a donut here, my brother brought me it. It was a raspberry filled donut. He smashed it, because that's we have to eat it!!! The raspberry was deliciously tart, and sweet. Just as it should be, not that fake filling stuff. The next day we try a glaze, mmmm. So this Monday is blueberry day or something like that. And I will walk in those doors for the first time, by myself, and eat my way through umpa-lumpa blueberry filled donuts! I can't wait!!!!"}
{"text":"We love Lamar's!! Their doughnuts are always so fresh and delicious! The employees are always so helpful and friendly. Overall great customer service and experience every time!! We have made Lamar's our one stop shop for doughnuts and recommend them to all our friends!"}
{"text":"I *love* donuts and I have been coming to LaMar's for a LONG time. I think we figured it has been almost 10 years and I can't believe I haven't thrown some Yelp love their way yet! I first encountered them while I was working in an office off of I-17 and someone there brought a box in to share at a meeting. After one bite, I had to know where to get these things.   Once they were exposed to a box of LaMar's, my family would probably KILL me if I showed up at home empty handed and they knew I was in that area. Even the sat-in-the-car-all-day-and-on-the-counter-overnight ones were better than going somewhere else!  After that, despite being an hour or more from home, I stopped by whenever I had an excuse to be that far away: Are we heading to Flagstaff? Can I leave in the morning so that I can stop by LaMar's for a box before they run out? Am I working in the area? Is it cool enough that I can leave a dozen in the car while I take another into the customer meeting? Yes, you have to think about these things because 100 degree days do not make for happy donuts if they're left in the car... and arriving at an office with a box of donuts that people can't eat is not cool. Dude could get his a** kicked for doing something like that!  The apple fritters are amazing. Unlike many others, they're thin and bigger than a small pizza. They're not as dense as typical fritters and they're not greasy. Unless you get there early, these are often difficult to get.   I like the plain raised donut with chocolate frosting, which is a good baseline at any shop. Here, though, the long johns with Bavarian cream in them are amazing... if you like that sort of thing. They also have the same donut filled with whipped cream if that is more your style. This time, I had a blueberry cake donut, which was really good, and the apple spice donut and maple frosted ones are also on the list. My kids like the cake donut with candy-coated chocolate covering the chocolate frosting.   I really haven't met a donut here that I didn't like, although the brown raised dough (I think it is supposed to be a Devil's food kind of thing) isn't really chocolatey enough for my tastes. You may love it, and I wouldn't turn it down if it were the last donut in the box.  Several years ago, they used Daz Bog coffee, which I thought was OK although it was nothing special. They now have something called LaMar's Blend, which seems better to me. Who knows, it could be the same coffee with a different name -- I've only had a single cup and it has been a couple years since I've been there, but it tasted smoother and fresher than it did in the \"old days.\"  The only downside is the distance from my house -- which is also an upside since I can't run enough miles to burn off all of the donuts I'd be eating if it were closer. As far as I know, this is STILL the only location in Arizona."}
{"text":"BEST DONUT EVER! Seriously.  So, I've had LaMar's Donuts bookmarked for quite some time now and I just happened to be close enough today to stop by and pick up a dozen donuts.  I tried the chocolate glazed Bavarian cream filled bar. It was huge, so I cut it in half. I'm considering eating the other half right now!  They had so many choices and the prices were very fair. The place was super busy in the late morning, so you know they are good.  If I lived closer to this place I think I'd be in big trouble!"}
{"text":"Great donuts! Get there early for your favorites. Coffee is good as well.  Yelp on the other hand is becoming increasingly annoying. Why should a donut shop require a long review?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today.. And we were glad we did! By far the best donut spot we have found since our move to Phoenix.  Worth the 15 minute ride! This will be our new \"go to\" for donuts on the weekend. Red velvet was my favorite"}
{"text":"The best donut in this world!  LaMar's donut is so fluffy and it does not taste greasy at all.  It's like biting into cloud."}
{"text":"So yummy, any variety! Yummy jumbo cinnamon rolls too! My favorite is an Old Fashioned Sour Cream with the top dipped in chocolate! Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"I'm not really the biggest doughnut fan but hey, every so often I want one.  The price of Krispy Kreme scares me away.  The ghettoness of Dunkin Donuts scares me away from there.  Lamars has good deals and great quality.  I really like that their selection is always different.  Went there before the election and they had special McCain and Obama pastries.  There are always plenty of employees so the wait is never bad and it is right off the freeway so it is convenient.  Can't say I'd go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Super legit donuts!  Someone at work brought these in last week and unfortunately, I did not get to sample one.  I decided to grab some this morning.  I ordered a dozen and brought them into work to show some love for my new coworkers.  The donuts were delicious!  I got all raised varieties and everyone loved them.  I will be back to try out the cake donuts.  These are up there with Bosa Donuts as the best I have had so far in Phoenix.  It's real close to work which is good and bad.  Good when you want a donut, bad when you are on a diet!"}
{"text":"So good to finally find a good donut shop close to my work. Sure does beat Krispy Kreme IMHO. The maple are delicious."}
{"text":"What a great place! We were looking for a Dunkin Donuts, but I'm really glad we didn't find it. The two working behind the counter were super nice and welcoming to us. We came in for coffee, but as soon as we tried one of the samples up on the counter, we knew donuts were in our future.   We tried the buttermilk stick, which was old school amazing, and the sour cream old fashioned, which we were given a sample of when the woman heard us talking about it. It was really nice of her to do that.  Our coffees were delicious as well. I will definitely be back when in Phoenix next time!"}
{"text":"Great service and great donuts. They even have a drive through. Prices are a tad higher than other donut shops though. Regular donuts are $1.08. One of the few donut shops that actually have fountain soda too!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  They had these back in Missouri but they closed out of St. Louis. I'm so glad they opened one in Phoenix! I love donut shops that make their donuts in house and have a wide variety to choose from. If I lived closer, I'd be about 50 lbs overweight from eating here all the time. Beats DD and Krispy Kreme any day."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY!! Truly the best donuts EVER!! I live in Wittmann and we drive all the way over there just to get donuts from here! They are so kind and make the best coffee also! I would recommend this place to EVERYONE!! Can't wait to go back and get more! They are HUGE to not your normal sized little donuts!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the deal is. I really hate donuts and these especially. They just too big. They're too soft and fresh. It's annoying. They're not even greasy. Seldom too sugary. And then, some lunatic somewhere decrees there to be \"National Donut Day\" (see footnote) and this place goes bonkers.   How bonkers? So bonkers that the line inside weaves around long enough that I can't spot a six-foot-four husband. I go back outside and text, \"why don't I see you?\"  Sure enough, he's over in line perfectly behind where people are paying, just enough in a blind spot. Are we all this sugar-starved and crazy? One free donut and we line up single-file like teacher's got the whip. And, some people, so lazy! Won't even get out of the car - they go through the drive thru. Losers!  The best part of the fifty-deep line inside was the look on someone's face as they entered. Then, the current last-in-line slowly raised up a white placard like they were bidding at auction. Eye contact was made. The card read, \"END\".  Then you saw the dope at the door get a \"WOW!\" again face and the torch was passed. Olympic event here, this donut line!   Was it worth it?   The line moved fast and we had fun. It was gorgeous weather in Phoenix - cool(ish) and breezy - very entertaining watching the blondest-haired little boy outside trying to keep hold of his napkin while double fisting a chocolate donut and getting most of it smeared all over his face. It didn't hurt that the hilarious lady behind us was narrating it in a Southern dialect, \"I got responsibilities, see, I got to keep hold of the napkin but no way I'm putting down this donut.\" And his little elbow kept trying to track the napkin.   I'm certain that kid don't care that Lamar's is a franchise - Ray Lamar had one shop since 1960, in Kansas City, Missouri until he decided to franchise in 1990. This is the only Lamar's in Arizona. (Your next closest is Denver.) on a normal day, the shop is spacious, very clean and offers ample seating. I can't say enough great, I mean, terrible, terrible things about the staff here. And the variety of donuts...  Surprisingly, I dislike all these donuts equally! The fresh raspberry bursting from the glazed and filled, the lousy cake donuts, and the longest John that I'm sure is being measured by Guinness Book as we speak. (They don't call 'em \"long johns\" here, they're \"Lamar bars\" btw.) and the price - I forget if it's .98 or .89 (donut-induced-dyslexia) but the price is a steal. (Specialty one & fritters are a little more.)  I'm sure the next time we're here - when there are only ten people in line - and no \"END\" card - we'll miss this one crazy donut day.  (Uh oh! Not a lunatic at all...see \"The History of Donut Day\" www.salarmychicago.org/donutday/donutDayHistory.html )"}
{"text":"Nothing special, got 1/2 dozen of assortments.  cake donut was the best of the bunch.  the reg chocolate glazed and original glazed was okay.  It left a powdery aftertaste.  Not melt in your mouth and chewy like Randy\"s Donuts in LA.  BTW, the available hours really suck.  Don't they know that people eat donuts at various times of the day?  Why close at 2PM everyday?"}
{"text":"There's a reason Lamar's is famous! They have the most amazing homemade and delicious donuts I've ever had."}
{"text":"The best donuts ever!  My only regret is every time I go they don't have much left and we drive about 45 minutes just for the donuts.  They are open til 2 pm but every time I've gone it's been round noon and they have a very limited selection.  Today I was forced to get a blueberry caked donut for that's all that was left and it was so moist inside, nothing like any other cake donut ever but it just verified to me they are the best donuts around.  Tasty and moist and even day old(for the weekend) they are delish.  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Q:  What has no beginning, middle, or end? A:  This review. Just kidding. A doughnut!  Doughnuts, doughnuts, doughnuts!  They've been making doughnuts since 1933.  With 25 locations across five states, I can see why this doughnut shop is so loved.  Here at LaMar's, the prices are good, the doughnuts are ginormous, and they make a great raised doughnut!  At 1PM on a Monday, they were out of the original glaze so we gabbed a plain with chocolate, some crullers, and a couple of others.  Soon we were carrying out a slightly waxy bag filled with doughnuts to the car to be enjoyed with coffee.  Soft airy doughnuts were consumed and enjoyed.  I love raised doughnuts and these were delicious.   Make a trip out here at LaMar's for big doughnuts at a fantastic price!"}
{"text":"I've eaten the donuts at LaMars in Kansas city and these donuts didn't stack up. They were greasy and left a lot to be desired. The staff wasn't very friendly either."}
{"text":"This place rocks especially the donuts. The service is excellent,  atmosphere is what a donut shop should be. I will definitely be returning to get donuts in the future."}
{"text":"Now this is what donuts and coffee should be about. Friendly, nice and fluffy(big) donuts. Great coffee and refills. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"By far the best donuts I've ever had!!!! So delicious!!! The ladies work hard in here and are still doing it with a smile on their faces! It's super clean in here as well! Love this place, the employees, and those bomb donuts!!! Thanks Lamar for your recipe of Joy!!!!!"}
{"text":"The selection seems a little light for such a highly toted place. I was extremely disappointed with what they called an apple fritter- there was only about 2 bits of apple a quarter of the size of a penny- both length and width."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some good donuts.  My husband and I have even ran all over Phoenix in search of donuts only to find that most of the stores were either out of business or closed for the day, at 11 am.  Ugh.  One day I was craving donuts, this is not unusual, and on the way to my mother-in-law's house my husband pulled off the freeway and into the parking lot of Lamar's.  We were greeted by the warm and cozy smell of fresh donuts.  After looking over their rather impressive collection of delectable looking donuts, I narrowed it down to a maple bar, always my favorite, and a fritter of some type of fruit.  My donuts were absolutely delicious.  They were fresh and tasty.  They were super soft and yummy inside.  Lamar's is a fantastic place for donuts.  The cashiers are always nice too."}
{"text":"I have dined at 3 restaurants around this location and finally went in to try the donuts.  I do not recommend the donut holes, not impressed what so ever. The best donut he's are without a doubt Bosa Donuts us they are $0.99 a dozen compared to $2.79 a dozen at LaMar's Donuts.  Now if you order the regular size donuts they are huge! Would recommend the Eclairs that are cream filled.   Pretty busy on a Saturday Morning but the line went quickly.   Remember - tip for LaMar's, get the donuts not the donut holes"}
