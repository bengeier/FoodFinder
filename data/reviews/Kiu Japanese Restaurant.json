{"text":"Music was definitely too loud for sunday lunch. We had a table of 4 and we ordered :  Chirashi lunch Pressed sushi Hitsumabashi eel White sesame ramen Cod   Overall I thought Chirashi and pressed sushi was good because the sashimi was fresh.   Hitsumabashi eel was a big disappointment definitely not worth $20.00. Hitsumabashi eel was not grilled crispy and it was saucey. Hitsumabashi as I know from eating in Tokyo, was crispy and not at all saucey. So if you are expecting the same, you will be disappointed.   Ramen was ok, nothing extraordinary.  I would rather get it from Santouka.   Cod was good just as any other japanese restaurant.   Service was not good as we had to flag down for service such as taking away empty plates and getting more tea."}
{"text":"Came here on their 3rd day of opening. Didn't have a reservation but was promptly seated at 530pm when they opened.   Service was very good. Very attentive servers that came to check on us regularly.   We ordered the white shio ramen $11 (+extra noodles $2+extra cha shu $3 . Ramen had good texture but portion was very small. Soup base was not very salty and a bit light on flavours but overall very good.   We also ordered the 12 piece pressed (lightly seared) sushi  $30 (Hamachi, salmon, Angus beef and mackeral). It came to the table looking seared but it would have been better if it was served warm rather than cold.   Menu was very limited and no desserts but it was only their 3rd day of opening so we were told it the menu may expand  Overall we enjoyed our quick dinner before our movie. Dishes were a bit overpriced and portions are small but service and food were good."}
{"text":"I was very happy to learn about Kiu because Ramen Isshin is my favourite ramen spot of all the ramen options available in the GTA! We no longer have to go to Toronto to get great bowl of ramen.  We came in the tail-end of the lunch rush on a weekend and it was still pretty busy. We ordered:  - Fried chicken tossed in wasabi mayo: This from their specials menu. There wasn't much batter coating to this so it tasted fairly light for fried chicken. The wasabi mayo was the perfect touch as it gave some kick to the flavour without being overwhelming.  - Chirashi: Soooo fresh! I love ordering chirashi because it gives me an assorted variety of sashimi so I don't have to make that decision for myself. The sashimi was cut into bite sized pieces, making it more convenient to eat.  - Isshin Red Miso Ramen: One of the reasons why I love Ramen Isshin is because they don't simply serve a bowl of noodles with a couple of toppings on top. This bowl was generously filled with veggies and minced meat, giving me variety in every bite. The broth was layered with flavour, and while it has a vibrant red colour, it is not very spicy at all.   Service here was excellent - waitresses were friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Downtown prices for sushi that is comparable to an all you can eat in quality. Blowtorch aburi sushi is similar to kaka all you can eat. Ja bistro has much much much better aburi for a similar price. Beef carpaccio is mediocre - overcooked. Nigiri is probably the best thing on the menu.   Service - good. Waiters and waitresses are very attentive."}
{"text":"Aburi sushi is ok, not great but the Isshin ramen is fantastic. I would say it's on par with sansotei! The same richness and flavourful of broth and noodle. The ambiance and service is top notch too! Great place for lunch since they can make the ramen into a combo by adding 3 pieces of takoyaki."}
{"text":"definitely worth a visit~  we ordered chicken wings, seafood sashimi, salmon carpaccio, ramen, sushi and pork belly.. all the food came looking like a high end Japanese place, and it tasted great!  the service is qood but not great as we had to wait for the servers for a bit to get new napkins and public chopsticks for picking up food. It should be an automatic thing.   ambience is decent... but I can see this place will be a zoo when it is packed ..."}
{"text":"Takoyaki - Good. I would eat again. Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramem - Too salty to my taste. After a few sip, can't taste anything but salt. Black Sesame Ramen - Even more salty. At this point my taste buds were killed. Karaage - It's crunchy but nothing to crave about. I prefer Sansotei anytime over Kiu for the ramen. Service was pretty prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"I felt so inclined to write a review about this place that I created a yelp account. I'll start off by saying this place has decent ramen and fried chicken. What they don't have is any common sense, decency or hospitality. They are simply put, money hungry. The meal started off with my toddler dropping his Shirley temple on the floor. An honest mistake that a normal ice cream parlour would replace for free. The waiter asked me if we'd like another shirley temple, I said yes assuming he wouldn't charge us for the one that toppled all over my son and the floor. Of course he did the $hitty thing of charging us for two shirley temples. Really? How much does a non alcoholic drink cost them to make? Pennies? Secondly we ordered their $20 oyster special that included a glass of wine and a dozen oysters. Instead of warning us this special changed before punching in the order, the waiter delivered six oysters (not a dozen) to our table and informed us the \"special\" changed. Of course since we were a group of ten they automatically added gratuity to our bill, so we couldn't even control the amount we tipped this idiot. PS did i mention this meal was to celebrate my birthday? Well thanks for nothing Kiu. Your lack of service left a sour taste in my mouth. I won't forget this crappy experience I had at Kiu for a long, long time."}
{"text":"I came to this Japanese Restaurant several times and really fall in love with its noodles. There is a wide variety of noodles you can choose from its menu. If I want something special on that day, I will pick Tsukemen (dipping ramen noodles) served separately with pork bone dipping soup and it's quite hot and yummy. For something simple, I would like a bowl of white sesame pork bone soup ramen just as flavorful texture. For some other days, I probably pick either KOTTERI Rich Shoyu Ramen - rich, smooth & creamy taste, bamboo shoots, nori, marinated soft boiled egg, pork belly cha shu, green onions OR Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen with Takoyaki (Octopus balls), so yummy!!"}
{"text":"New place to having Japanese food. Nice environment! I ordered original ramen, the taste is good. But since they just opened, the service is not that fast."}
{"text":"Great Japanese Fusion! This place opens at 5 pm for dinner located in downtown markham. Really good Japanese Fusion food, a bit on the pricey side but the food is worth it if your into high end Japanese fusion."}
{"text":"Chirashi bowl and seared sushi were decently good. Ramen, however, was not. Broth was oily and overall just didn't taste good.   My waiter was awkward, unfriendly and rude. He made a mistake by giving me a ramen I didn't order then turned around and made it seem as if it was my fault. Made me have to defend myself and feel tense afterwards. The waitresses helping him out, however, were all pleasant.   Go to Inatei near Hwy 7 and Leslie instead."}
{"text":"I was super excited to find another restaurant offering pressed sushi. Unfortunately, I was disappointed after being spoiled by Saku's pressed sushi. Pressed sushi is a balanced between the torched fish and deliciously flavoured rice. The salmon was thin at the top and was dominated by rice. The rice had a nice flavour but it was only rice, so basically I had torched salmon sushi ($13 for 6 pieces). My friend's ramen was better priced ($11) and reasonable but nothing notable compared to the nearby Sansotei. The takowasabi was reasonably priced and good as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Nice interior and service but food is just average.. and overpriced. Looking through the menu, it was hard to decide what to get (nothing sounded special/caught my attention).   Ordered the Red Dragon Ramen and Snow Crab Croquettes, both $16 each (overpriced in my opinion). The ramen was salty and had no depth in flavour. I know ramen is not the healthiest food, but while I was eating it I kept wondering how much salt and oil they used. It included two thin slices of chashu - not thick slices of pork belly I usually expect. I guess the best part of the ramen was the egg, which was perfectly cooked. The snow crab croquettes were average, and way too overpriced for what you get. Two croquettes, filled mostly with a cream sauce. I literally had one small bite of what I believe was crab meat. It came with a tomato sauce (tasted like an ordinary tomato pasta sauce), a cream sauce, and a small side of salad. Overall, I don't feel like the food was worth the money."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for an early lunch. Liked the decor and the friendly welcome by the chefs we passed as we were being seated. Ordered the chicken karaage don, shared the Nigiri sushi (11 pc), 2pc stuffed chicken wings and Spicy white sesame shio ramen between the three of us.  Stuffed chicken wings were good but not sure if I'd order them again. The chicken karaage was nicely deep fried and flavourful. Ramen was ok- good amount of noodles, 2 pc if cha shu, half an egg. Not as spicy as I'd thought. The sushi seemed a bit on the pricier side and was ok as well, nice assortment. I liked the chicken karaage don best.  Service was great and really liked the atmosphere. Had hoped for more from the food after reading the other reviews. Would try a different ramen the next time."}
{"text":"had the worst rice in my life. Order two lunch combo, they serve low quality rice and it's too hard. But the others are good. will try again."}
{"text":"The food here was really good! We got the ramen which was really flavourful. We also ordered Ebi mayo which had a nice touch of lotus root and pomegranate seeds and takoyaki which tasted perfect (some places I find it tastes too fishy). We got all these orders within a reasonable time. However it took 35min to get the bone marrow and beef tongue.  Mind you it was the first two items we ordered. I had to follow up three times with these 2 items. The first time our waiter said \"it's on the way\" and the second time I repeatedly made eye contact with another waitress - she looked directly at me and then ignored me...twice! What kind of service is that? I understand you might not want to deal with our table because you weren't our server but at least have the decency to acknowledge our table and say you'll get our waitress. I'd rate the service here a 2. There was no apology for the delay in our order. Beef tongue cooks on a hot plate so what is the rationale behind it taking 35min? Luckily The sauces with the beef tongue were really good. Overall the food saved my experience here."}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant uptown, the quality is consistent. Very family friendly. My kids can have the ramen, while I have the sushi. The indoor underground parking is a bonus."}
{"text":"Saw some mediocre reviews but it's actually not that bad..thought the portions were smaller than kingyo.  Food was good and presented nicely. Service felt very inexperienced..the servers sounded like they were forced to read a script. They had no idea of what certain things are.  Overall not bad..very pricey for their nigiri... can have more and better elsewhere. Worth a shot for first time though."}
{"text":"Yo, axe me why mans gotta charge like a 19 dollar for a sample appetizer plate.  Mans get samples at Costco for free fam.  They brought out like a bento box ting with like 9 little bowls.  Yo, they put a cucumber on a small plate with a little yellow mustard sushi ting and told mans \"this ain't Japanese food mans can get around here.\"  Around where dawg!  Yo, you put a cucumber on a mini plate and you're telling me I can't get no cucumber from no grocery store? And they charge a 19 buck for it.  Rasssssssss.  I ordered a spicy ramen ting too.  Yo, on the real, they brought me the wrong ramen.  BUT.  I was cool wid it, y'know? Dun kno mans was deeeeeeealing the ramen but YO, the fire alarms go off.  And mans come to me like yo, don't worry, there's a fire in the next building but we're safe here.  YO!!!!! Dawg. They told me there was a fire in the NEXT building but we were fine.  Say word we're fine yo!  Say word!  Yo, if you go to this restaurant then you know it's on the second floor of the building.  IF there's a fire, you ain't fine dawg, you ain't fine on no second floor!!  Eventually they're all like, yo you gotta leave, take everything and bounce.  So I'm like what about my ramen dawg?  Y'all gonna let go cold or what?  Yo all in all imma give this place a 2 star.  One star because mans can appreciate a good ramen, y'know?  Like a nice soup with the noodle.  But yo, I ain't about no 19 dollars for no sample plate ting.  Y'all don't need to eat at this Japanese place, I ain't payin no Tokyo prices for no Markham sushi, go grab yourself a beer and a movie at the Cineplex VIP.  Trusss me danny."}
{"text":"Kiu has become one of our favourite restaurants for a relaxed, yet upscale Japanese dinner.   The service is excellent. From the traditional enthusiastic Japanese greeting when we walk in to the thank-yous when we walk out, I really feel like an appreciated customer! Tea (not free, but with free refills) and water are constantly refilled. Suggestions seem sincere and have been winners so far. The matcha-battered tempura seafood, calamari, and sashimi specials were very tasty. The specials change frequently, so it is nice to have something new to try every now and then. The staff make a genuine effort to remember you and your preferences if you visit often.   The food is 10/10! I am working my way through the different ramen offerings (halfway there!) So far, my favourites are the red miso, spicy vegetarian and light assari ramens. The ramen noodles are al dente and chewy, and the egg is so tender! The bone marrow is so rich and filling--worth waiting the 20 minutes it takes to make. The chicken karaage is juicy and fried very well (not greasy, considering it's fried chicken.) The pressed sushi has a good variety (4 types for the 8-piece), but can be a bit difficult to pick up with chopsticks. Only order the sushi/sashimi if you are open to trying different things and don't mind not being able to choose the fish.   The lunch menu is different, and does include rice options (not available during dinner.) Still need to go for lunch, but if the dinner experience is an indicator of what's to come, I cannot wait to try it and visit Kiu in the afternoon!  10/10 for sure!"}
{"text":"I come here fairly often for lunch and their ramen is good. My favourite one is the white sesame ramen, probably because of the novelty of grinding the sesame seeds.  Similar concept to this is the Chicken Katsu meal, where you can  grind the sesame seeds and it comes with various side dishes. It's a very filling meal as you can see!  I'm giving this a 4/5 because I don't really like the chirashi (forgot to take a picture) and their service can be quite slow at lunch."}
{"text":"Well! I would definitely recommend. We order a few plates such a tapas and sushi, each dish was great and fresh. Also chilled cocktail made of cassis was wonderful. Service was nice and made some excellent recommendations both food and beverage. Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 4 stars based on their ramen. Their ramen is SO GOOD. Better than Sansotei in my opinion, and I love Sansotei. Their soup bases are flavourful but not too salty. I've had the garlic ramen, which I thought needed more of a garlicky kick, but was still enjoyable. The red miso ramen though was amazing. The soup base was addictingly flavourful, aromatic, and very different from other ramen soup bases that I've tried. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a soft boiled egg. This is my new #1 ramen restaurant in the GTA. I still think their aburi is mediocre in comparison to Toronto restaurants but, I definitely recommend the ramen."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant twice for lunch. I brought my friends back the second time along with their tweens. The restaurant has a fast-pace atmosphere where the staff often look busy and the food come relatively quickly. There are a good variety to choose from the lunch menu (weekends). From Ramen to lunch combos, the prices are reasonable. To me, The sashimi and sushi are more pricy but I find they are fresh and I enjoy how they plate the food."}
{"text":"Quality has gone significantly down since it's opened. I came here with my fiancé last night and we both ordered the red miso ramen. Upon the first couple of bites, we noticed that there wasn't any flavour. As you already know, the most important part of ramen is the soup base. We notified the server that we were unhappy with the taste of the ramen and requested for some extra soup base to add some more flavour. Once we got it, I tried the soup base and it tasted like hot water! I was told it was a pork bone broth, but it has absolutely no taste. I'm disappointed that food quality has significantly declined."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for dinner and it was exactly what I had expected it to be.  Service: 4.5/5 - Everyone was extremely welcoming from when we entered to when we left. All the staff would greet us and bowed as we walked to our table and as we left! Our server was very friendly and patiently recommended a few dishes for us to try. Every dish that was served was explained thoroughly, which I thought added an extra personal touch to the restaurant. I docked off a 0.5 because the service seems to be a bit of a disorganized still...there were a lot of servers, waiters and managers...but getting a cup refilled with water took a long time for some reason. Although everyone was extremely polite (I believe most of the staff are Japanese).  Ambiance: 4/5 - The seating area is actually quite small. I think there about 20-25? tables of 4...but you can push some of the tables together if you have larger groups. There are bar seats as well. But all in all, if you come on a weekend during prime hours without a reservation, you might need to wait  over an hr since seating seems limited. Also, I understand that they are not officially open yet, but they do not have blinds installed on their windows yet. This, during dinner time, you may be blinded by the sun at certain seats. Renovations are nice, but nothing amazing.  Food: 4/5 - They have a decent amount of izakaya dishes to choose from and they are reasonably priced. Based on what we ordered, I liked all of them except for the Makunouchi box. The box is almost like a sampler...there were 9 different small dishes, but other than the garlic tuna dish, everything was a little too \"exotic\" for my tastebuds...so I won't be ordering that again.   My fave dishes were the Chu Toro, 12 pressed sushi, and the seafood croquettes. My mom loved their chawamushi. We were also quite surprised at how fresh and flavourful the black cod was as well!  They are also known for their ramen dishes, although the variety comes only from different soup bases as opposed to what's actually in the ramen. There is either vegetarian ramen (ie, mushrooms, bamboo shoots) or pork chashu ramen. We ordered the garlic shoyu chashu ramen, but it was a bit too salty for my taste. The noodles were the perfect texture tho!  Presentation: 5/5 - Everything was displayed perfectly and as I mentioned before, the servers would explain each dish when served.  I am a Markham foodie and I also love izakaya's, so I'm glad Kiu opened so close to home! I will definitely be returning to try some new dishes as well as the pressed sushi again! Happy to recommend this place to anyone! :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming back frequently to try various items. The dipping ramen is always a favourite. So delicious and they're very willing to give you some pork bone broth at the end to dilute the soup to drink. Perfect comfort dish for the cold weather."}
{"text":"I love ramen.  These guys are pretty good, conveniently located next to Cineplex in Downtown Markham.  Price is a little on the high side."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with a party of 8 people. The customer service was really good with our first server. However a second server served us and he had a really bad attitude , didn't seem to care nor want to take our order. There was poor communication between the servers because server #1 came back to us and asked us what we wanted to order when our order was already taken. So server #2 served all our food orders and he didn't really seem like he was welcoming or friendly at all. When we asked to take out the cake , server #2 said that there's a cake charge fee of $8 which we never got notified of and never in my whole life has any restaurants charged us for bringing in a cake to cebrate there ! By the time we paid for the bill, server #1 was confused on whose food order was which person which I don't understand how come the second server didn't notify him about. So each one of us repeated our orders to him again to confirm it for him.   Long story short, the second server that served us didn't take full responsibility to complete his job of serving a party of 8 people. Leaving the first server cliff hanging and confused which I feel better communication amongst the staff is required.   As for the food, I ordered the lobster ceviche that tasted decent. However if you are really hungry, I Wouldn't suggest this dish because it didn't fill me up at all for such a small portion. For the price of it wasn't really worth it and I end up having to order more dishs after to be full"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better cocktails. The bartender Albert was such a fantastic host to us as we dined at the bar. He makes the most delicious cocktails and you can see the care and thought he puts into every step. The best Old Fashioned in the city. Will be returning frequently :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and really aesthetically pleasing food. Amazing service at a beautiful and clean location. However, I did not like the ramen, I found it too salty. The bill can get really expensive so be prepared. I've been there numerous times and every experience is great and satisfying."}
{"text":"This was a weird one.  My wife and I arrived about 11:20 for lunch.  The restaurant hadn't opened yet, so we decided to go across the street to Aroma for a coffee first.  We returned at 11:40 and my wife was still carrying the Aroma cup.  The restaurant was completely empty.  The waitress led us in...and then wouldn't seat us because we had a drink from elsewhere.  So we left.  I have never experienced a restaurant I will never return to without even having tried the food.  BIZARRE."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last week and the food was great. I had the aburi sushi, more specifically 8 piece of four kinds of aburi oshi. It was delicious!  I actually ended up ordering more. The only downside I would say (although I'm not deducting a star) is that I wish that there was a little less rice, but it was delicious.   The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and has a lovely design. We were seated in a booth by the windows which was nice. The building it is in is relatively new as the area itself still has a lot of construction.  But bonus to tons of free parking and close to major highways.   One last note, their website says that they are in Toronto, but it isn't. It is in Markham. If you put the address on the site in google maps it will take you somewhere else completely.   Overall, I'd definitely recommend here. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the service and variety of dishes! Food was good quality and service was impeccable"}
{"text":"Service - Good as usual. The service has always been good at this restaurant which is the one thing that makes it stand out. Servers area always very attentive.   Food - They offer a sushi bar, some cooked food and ramen. So it's like your one stop shop for Japanese food. The price of their sushi tends to be on the higher side. I would say all the food is good, but not exceptional. In particular, I find the ramen underwhelming although I also feel that is the case for the Isshin Ramen location downtown and it is the same owner. A star was definitely knocked down due to the ramen. This must be the only ramen place that only gives you half an egg in the ramen. I feel like this is unacceptable, what happened to the other half. When it says an egg is included, I WHOLE egg should be included. The menu does not say HALF an egg."}
{"text":"The service is impeccable. I went there to celebrate my bf's birthday on a Monday night. Apparently on Mondays it's  their specials on fresh oysters! That was a bonus! Honestly, I can't complain. The food is good and tasteful. I wouldn't recommend the torch sushi at this place, I've had better at other sushi restaurants. But overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Tried the takoyaki, chicken karate and ramen.   This was a nice modern clean place.  Servers were attentive. Sitting by the ramen bar was a good experience and the chefs were friendly. Everyone is smiling and no grumpy servers you may find at other locations.   Lunch service price is not cheap but not overly expensive for the experience. But I cannot attest to the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Location: Upscale japanese a-la-carte restaurant in Downtown Markham area. Right beside Markham VIP. Outdoor and underground parking available but fill up quickly.  Specialities: Fresh sushi, sashimi, izakaya-style appetizers, ramen, and liquor licensed - Japanese beer, sake and other alcoholic beverages  Perks: they have a special recommendation menu with discounts on select items. I got a cell phone reminder for my reservation and suggestions for alternate parking space for Mother's day. I thought that was a nice touch.  Food: Ordered Mother's Day omakase ($150 for 4 ppl) which includes a variety of appetizers ranging from wasabi taco, seaweed salad, 4 pcs of yakitori / pork belly, black cod curry tempura, grilled bone marrow, to the \"20 pc sushi omakase\". The quality of the food was great - fresh sushi, beautiful plating, creative flavours. BUT, really not enough to fill 4 adults for the price we paid. The 20 pc omakase ends up to be 5 pieces of sushi per person. The appetizers all end up to be one pieces per guest. We had to order 2 additional appetizers and 2 additional ramens to fill up.  Ramen: I opted for the tsukemen and garlic shoyu ramen. Garlic shoyu has a strong flavoured garlic oil, tasty and lots of toppings. As for the tsukemen, it wasn't too surprising. The soup is served in a stone bowl. But since all the noodles and toppings were cold, it took a while to warm up - especially considering we were sharing bowls.  Overall: you pay for the atmosphere, ambience and service. If you want good, affordable Japanese food or sushi, this may not be the best choice for you.   Suggetion for improvement: include the Chinese / Japanese names for sake and liquor as the majority of customers can recognize them. They are not familiar with the English translations."}
{"text":"The TL;DR version: Decent quality food, but way overpriced.  Ordered the large sashimi platter: 42 pieces of sashimi, all fresh, with a few premium items like four slices of geoduck, three small tongues of uni, one piece of raw shrimp.  This all came on a slim wooden plank, coming in at $100. Most interesting / unique were the two small spoons containing a chopped fish with a small cube of 'milk tofu' which tasted a bit like cream cheese.  Beef tataki was 12, one-inch, thinly sliced pieces of beef with in a ponzu sauce, sprinkled with a bit of fried garlic on each slice, garnished with a few pomegranate seeds.  The aburi sushi: Seven pieces of torched sushi which included seared beef, shrimp, tuna, salmon with jalapeno. Again, high quality seafood and nicely vinegar'd rice, but at $30 ... yeesh.  And there's the rub - The seafood is great quality, but the prices are unreasonably high considering there are other, more established equivalents in the downtown area for a very comparable price (maybe even at a couple dollars less per dish).    The service here, while super nice and very accommodating, are still trying to gain their footing. IE: A couple servers serving ramen, rather than setting them in front of each diner as appropriate, just asked us to pass it down the table. Or rather than move around the table to set down dishes, just stood in one spot and handed them to us individually. And instead of removing empty plates before serving new ones, we were expected to move dirty plates off the table for ourselves before the new dishes / food were placed before us.    The ramen, by the way, having tried the white sesame, spicy miso, roasted garlic, and the rich broth, were OK but were solidly mediocre.  I'd come here again for maybe a quick bite before catching a movie, but otherwise can't see myself recommending Kiu."}
{"text":"I've heard many bad reviews of this place through friends and I was prepared for the worst... I didn't expect it to be THIS bad.   Ramen is mediocre at best.  I ordered the regular white sesame ramen for $11. It came with sesame seeds for us to crush. The broth wasn't flavourful - tasted like absolutely nothing. It came with half an egg and 3 slices of pork. Just go to Sansotei/Kenzo/Santouka for better portions and price.  Service wasn't the greatest either. We often had to flag our waiter down to order, ask for more water/tea, etc. Ironically enough, they were in SUCH a hurry to get us out (around 8:15 pm). The four of us sat there for under an hour. Many tables were empty as we were leaving yet no line up was found.  Left feeling hungry and ended up drinking tons of water back home... Meh food, meh service, and an overload of MSG at its finest."}
{"text":"This was a great find. It does cost more than your typical Japanese restaurant and if you normally go AYCE you will spend more for sure but I found the quality more than made up for it. It looked fairly busy so I would recommend reservations.  The decor was nice with the dark wood and the staff with iPads was neat but if they aren't putting your orders in, it doesn't matter what they use. I found the service was the worst part of the visit. He was friendly to talk to but when we have to ask for an item to be ordered several times and can't even get tea, that's a huge problem with me.  The food itself was so pretty and backed it up with tons of flavour. We shared omikase and when they say 15 selections, you're mostly getting 10 pieces of sushi and a few other things. But this is far beyond a thick hunk of salmon on dried out rice. The roasted garlic ramen was incredible. I'll admit, one of my friends did all the ordering but even the least favourite dish (red something ramen) was still pretty good. One of my friends would have been happy to eat the stuffed chicken wings all night long. They smell spicy but aren't. The purple yam coconut crepe cake was very light despite appearing to be heavy and dense.  Definitely a place to go when you want a treat."}
{"text":"Good drinks from new bartend!! I love this  atmosphere. Washroom is really good. I wanna try to eat food and ramen next time."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about Kiu, so my girlfriend and I decided to try it. The first thing that hit us was the price, it wasn't cheap barring that we thought maybe the quality would justify the cost.  Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed.   We ordered what our host recommended the chicken karaage ($8) was decent but it was not spectacular, it was doughy in that you could still taste the flour and tasted extremely bland without the accompanying mayonnaise.  The pressed sushi 8 various pieces ($18) was not what we expected. The rice fell apart upon grabbing it and it tasted like a normal maki one would get at an all you can eat location. Not one you would get at an izakaya location.   The black cod ($19) was extremely disappointing, it was no more than a piece of cod the size of a domestic palm finished off with a bland and uninteresting miso glaze.  The chicken wing dumpling was probably the best portion of the meal. An interesting concept infusing a traditional Chinese dumpling in a chicken wing, it was nicely done.  The dessert menu was lacking as you only had an option between ice cream (of various flavours) ($6.80) and a pannacotta ($8.50)  I will commend the fast and pleasant service.  All in all if your looking for a izakaya location that combines exquisite quality with reasonable pricing then I suggest you go to any of the populated izakayas in downtown Toronto. If your not willing to make the adventure I highly suggest kinka izakaya (Sheppard and Yonge)."}
{"text":"When Kiu first opened there were a few kinks to work out.  Almost a year later, it's doing much, much better.  The restaurant continues to impress with a spacious reception area, dark trendy decor and friendly staff who takes your order on an iPad.  The menu remains the same for the most part with some specials occasionally ie. youu can add a few extra takoyaki as a side to your ramen etc.  Ramen remains my favourite thing at Kiu.  Per my previous review, it's still a few dollars more expensive here but is beginning to feel more worth it due to the locale and service.  Pressed sushi is a great sharing plate but I don't find their other sushi to be particularly fresh.  I would caution against the chirashi here as it is literally chopped up bits of sashimi which leads me to think they're not using the largest and most fresh pieces."}
{"text":"This is a really cool and modern space - away from the Chinese-run (nothing wrong with those of course) restaurants they call Japanese but include every Asian dish under the sun.  Kiu is located within the Cineplex Theater and how convenient - you can eat here before or after your movie (VIP cinemas here as well!)  I have to agree with other reviews, the service here is just great. For example, I had spilled some ice cubes on the table and out of nowhere, this random waiter came with stacks of tissues and helped me clean the table. Observant! Tea glasses were always filled and my sake glass was never empty.  Food here is not traditional, but more fusion - if you like your Japanese food like that. My mom and I were having a mother-daughter date and we started with oysters (FRESH!), beef tongue (which you cook yourself and is super cool), Lobster sushi (yum!), beef tataki, and toro sashimi.  Dessert we had the black seasame cheese cake which was delish.  If you're in the area and want a cool and hip place to have great Japanese food, I would highly recommend Kiu. I don't think there is anything similar in the area.   The only issue is night we went, most of the 300ml sake bottles were sold out. We were fortunate though that the one sake (on special to boot) we ended up ordering was fantastic. That sake was the favorite of the owner's so if it is good for him, it's good for us!"}
{"text":"This review is for Kiu's Chirashi, Seafood don, and mini Fish don.  For $6 the mini fish don is not bad, definitely a very small bowl and not enough as a main but plenty as an app.  The seafood don is my favourite! At $9 on the special lunch menue, it's a great deal.  Comes with snow crab, 2 uni pieces, 3 red tuna pieces.  I really enjoy this and get dissappointed when it's not available.  The Chirashi is a bit pricey at $18.  The photos here on Yelp didn't look too impressive so I was hesitant to try.  The sashimi is chopped up so you can't really tell what's in it.  Portion size was small for $18 and disappointed it didn't have any uni since even the $9 seafood don does.  Possitive is that it has more fish than expected, there is chopped torro in the middle that the photos usually don't show, mixed with the rice was tasty.  Overall taste was gd, but variety and portion size could improve on this dish.  Lastly as an extra, the crepe cake is delicious!  Photos attached for your reference."}
{"text":"3.5 stars + .5 for service.  First off I have to admit I'm a real snob when it comes to sushi so I'm sorry if I come off as pretentious (I just love sushi, so I'm harsh). I've been here a few times in the last couple months to try most of the things on their menu. Their ramen is a nice affordable and warming option for the winter and many of them are quite good, particularly their signature Kotteri Rich Shoyu and their Garlic Shoyu.   Also really enjoyed their Kyoto Style Milk Tofu. That velvety lusciousness and tender flavours are very unique and I haven't been to many places in the GTA that do tofu quite like that.   Because of my good experiences, I decided it was time to try their omakase. They have a walk in for $70 that is more contemporary/run by younger chefs and a reservation only for $120 which is more traditional.   I opted for the $70 option and also got some beer and a Makunoichi Box to start which is rotating appetizers. Hightlights for Makunochi Box were the monk fish liver w/ pesto, fresh takowasabi, and buttery eel. Other stuff was ok but not too special.   For the 15 piece omakase, highlights include the otoro (which is always a highlight), sea urchin, and the varieties of sea bream that the chefs had on display. They also did a little sashimi plate (which counted towards the 15 pieces) which had ankimo, hamachi belly, and aburi kurodai along with an interesting relish that I would definitely like to eat again.   DIdn't really enjoy the aburi amaebi (the subtle sweetness of the shrimp was removed by the char of the torch which gave it a slight bitterness instead. Since the shrimp is not very strongly flavoured it does not hold up well to an aburi approach compared to something like kurodai. I also understand the more contemporary aspect of it but I feel like there were too many accoutrements on some of the pieces -- just let them speak for themselves!  Usually when I do omakase, the first thing that happens is we are given hand towels so we can have clean hands when we eat our sushi. This was not provided to me and when I inquired about it, they told me that only happens for the $120 seating but they would ask about it for next time since they agreed that they should.   Next time will definitely try the $120 instead since I'm definitely a traditionalist when it comes to sushi."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place after seeing so many amazing pictures on social media. First thing walking in, all the staff is very aware of their surroundings and would greet you. They also make recommendations after asking you a few questions on your preference. We got an oshi aburi sushi, lamb chops, bone marrow and a red sesame ramen. I really enjoyed everything but the ramen. The broth was too busy for me to enjoy it. Overall, food was great, service was great and the restaurant is beautiful. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Great service great manners and great lunch. I ordered black cod lunch combo. And bf ordered unagi lunch combo. Both wonderful, taste of Japan. Literally made me feel like lunch in Japan minus the currency. However it's worth it IMO with the lunch combos we got."}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant, nice decoration, great food presentation and taste. Will definitely come back many time.  Price is at high side but worth it."}
{"text":"came again for dinner on civic holiday. got my go to dish the chicken karraage and  a side of  sushi rice. We also ordered 9pc chef choice nigiri and 8 piece aburi. Everything was great but the sushi rice here is the most amazing thing ever. For me they have the perfect mix for their sushi rice only one day i went there it was off a bit too much vinegar but i forgive them it was still good. Just try it for $3 for a bowl it is so worth it"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I think Ive tried enough of their dishes to finally have a thorough consensus of this place. My favourite thing about here is their ramen. Their ramen isn't bad, and I think they offer quite a few varieties. Their fish on their other hand is not fresh. I've tried their sashimi on two occasions and both times found it to be a bit fishy. None of my friends enjoyed the sashimi there either. One of them have actually told the server that her tuna and Bonito sashimi had an extremely fishy odour. I'd expect more for the price and what they position themselves to be. I've also had their apps and liked their takoyaki. Their karaage wasn't anything worth mentioning though. My favourite thing I've ever had here was a sesame cheesecake by bakersiu and it was super delicious. However, today my friend and I both had the matcha taro crepe cake and found it to be a bit weird. It was oddly sour, and it kind of seemed like the cream inside might have went bad? It was super disappointing and I don't think any of us will be back soon."}
{"text":"Came to this place many times and it is still very good.  The decorations, services, and food are great.  Always come here for ramen and I like it. Very tasteful and the noodle is not soggy or too al Dante.  I like u can fine your own sesame on your ramen and I personally think it brings up the taste a little.   Today we order the $1 oyster deal and its very fresh.  They give us cherry point and lucky lime from PEI, and on the side you can try 3 different \"condiments\", which is not the regular horseradish and cocktail sauce. All 3 goes good with the oysters and it's more on the personal preference on which one you like.   Also ordered chicken karage (4 PC's)  and ebi mayo (6 PC's). Again they both good,  maybe just slightly less mayo on the shrimp for me.   I had their sashimi and sushi before and they are fresh but it's not cheap. Lamb is not bad even I don't normally like eating lamb but I still eat it since it's not very gammy,  which I can accept.   I have tried many of their other food on menu but still prefer their cooked food more than their sashimi / sushi."}
{"text":"{Grilled Oysters}  My favourite appetizer dish from Kiu restaurant!! This oyster dish is grilled in shell with Grilled Oyster in the shell and topped with spicy cod roe, mayo, cheese, crispy panko bread, dill weed and a little tiny piece of lemon inside! The oyster itself had the right amount of creaminess and paired extremely well with the spicy cod roe and mayo!! The little piece of lemon hidden inside the creamy layer was a lovely surprised. I love love lemon juice on my oysters, so I was thrilled to taste it! I highly recommend this dish, ok it's more of a...YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU VISIT KIU AND PLEASE VISIT KIU SO YOU CAN TRY IT!! This review is not sponsored or anything, it's really how I feel about it.   I was excited to learn that Kiu offers ramen from Ramen Isshin! I've had ramen from Ramen Isshin before so I KNOW how delicious this was going to be. And I was right!! I ordered the Spicy White Sesame Shio Ramen ~  It came with thin noodles, a soft boiled egg, cha siu, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts. The thin noodles were perfectly cooked (not too hard but with the right amount of texture) , and their broth wasn't too salty or oily. I got the spicy version of one of the original ones. It had a good amount of spiciness, but I could use a little bit more. The egg had the wonderful not fully cooked yolk, my fave!! I also loved that you can grind your own sesame to top off the ramen. Made it more fragrant, and so of course I drank all the broth. So goooooood. The service was amazing as well, our server kept making sure we were doing good and if we needed more water. Would definitely come back to try other things!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen places, i recommend getting the Roasted garlic shoyu ramen. Also try the beef tataki and chicken karaage if you're willing to add appetizers."}
{"text":"Kiu has a great variety of ramen. I've tried the roasted garlic shoyu ramen and the white sesame shio ramen. Both were really good and tasty. They weren't too salty and the price is good. I also ordered the variety of pressed sushi (aburi oshi) and I feel like this is hit or miss. The first time I had it, I was blown away. The second time- not as much. The pressed sushi fell apart too much the second time I had it. Definitely want to come back for $1 oysters on Mondays."}
{"text":"Only took one dinner to win over this belly.  Whether you choose to sit at the sake bar, the sushi bar, the ramen bar, the VIP room, or the dining area, there is something great to watch, eat and drink.  A big fan of everything I tried on my first visit.  The bone marrow had to be the best thing - marinated with miso and cheese, check the diet at the door since this fatty goodness was heaven on garlic toast.  The beef tataki was not overcooked and very flavourful.  The Japanese uni - no words needed - its shipped from Japan and is amazing - no garnish required.    If you can't make the way to downtown Toronto for Isshin Ramen then this is the spot. The dipping ramen was recommended by staff.  Warning: broth is rich and it is just for dipping but I admit the taste was so good, I sipped a decent amount of it.  Feel free to request more broth to lighten the richness if that's your preference.  Some might argue that some dishes are almost too flavourful - but I'm not that kind of person.  Staff is great - they work together to give customers the best experience.  They know their stuff and share their knowledge.  Not a shabby looking place either - Great location as its right by the downtown Markham movie theatre and the Goodlife Gym (might need a workout after this meal)."}
{"text":"Kiu Japanese Restaurant is a restaurant that is open by the owners of Ramen Isshin, which I enjoyed their ramen at their sole downtown Toronto location. I came here for lunch and no reservations were needed. They are located on the 2nd floor across from the Cineplex theatre entrance.   My party ordered the Age Tofu, Hamachi and Salmon Aburi Pressed Sushi, and Ramen from their Ramen Isshin menu.   The age tofu from their special menu was definitely a huge letdown. The texture of outer skin of the tofu was chewy and soft which I wasn't expecting. The ingredients on top gave it a little spicy kick but the combination of the texture of the tofu and the ingredients on top did not work well together at all.  The hamachi aburi pressed sushi was another letdown since the hamachi had a strong fishy taste to it which kind of destroys the entire taste of the aburi style sushi. The salmon aburi pressed sushi was definitely a strong point and something I would order again. There was a kind of a creamy texture with the salmon and it tasted exceptional well.  I tried the Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen. The broth was a bit salty but it was not overly salty so that was ok. In general, I'm not a fan of thin noodles so the noodles were just ok. The piece of chashu meat was tender and good. Overall, the ramen is just average but gets the job done.   The service and ambience of the restaurant was certainly exceptional as everything came quickly and asking the waitresses to refill water was quick.   Overall, I believe Kiu Japanese Restaurant could be better overall. Would I come here again in the future? My answer would be yes as I will be avoiding certain items and trying new ones."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big foodies and we love to check out new Japanese restaurants. Especially places that serve omakase. We were excited to try this place and we finally went here last night with our 2 kids. We both ordered sushi, fried oysters, black cod while our kids ordered ramen. Service and food seem fine and decent enough until later my husband got the runs shortly after we finished our food and I got food poisoning! Let's just say we will not be returning back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great beverage selection and a very nice vibe! The price point is mid range, I ordered the Aburri sampler 4pc Salmon and 4pc Shrimp Ebi. My favourite was the shrimp so much so that I ordered a second round. Reservations is key here!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and our other friend. We were greeted by a group of waiters and waitresses once we entered, which is a pretty nice gesture to start off with.  My boyfriend and I ordered the black sesame tan tan noodles and chicken karage and our friend ordered the red miso ramen. The chicken karage came first and it was pretty crispy and juicy. The dipping sauce matches really well with the chicken, so make sure you dip in! My boyfriend and  friend got their ramen first and I figured that mine would come along soon, so I didn't bother asking about it. So I waited patiently for about 15 to 20 minutes and that's when I asked them whether my ramen was coming or not because everyone was almost done with their ramen. They went to check up on it and they found out that they forgot to put my order in. They kept apologizing to me (at least 4 times) but even so it still ruined the experience a little. I would still come back again next time, but hopefully this won't happen again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving ramen and decided to try something new, other than the usual Sansotei or Kinton ramen.  For a Sunday evening, the restaurant was quite packed and we were seated at one of the tall tables near the windows looking into the mall.    We decided to order an appetizer and sushi along with our ramen. We had takowasa (our fave! - must order at any Japanese restaurant) and scallop aburi pressed sushi.  We thought both were tasty but pretty standard and nothing really stood out to us.  As for the ramen, we both ordered the black sesame tan tan ramen. The portion size was great and the broth was flavourful with a bit of a kick to it, which we love!  Overall, we enjoyed our meal - the ambience was nice, we felt like we were at a high end restaurant and service was super quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant the other night with a friend and boy was I quite impressed!  First what caught my attention was the service! For the first time EVER, it seemed like the waiters cared about the customers and how they felt about their food/drinks. I ordered the Lychee Mojito (their special) and the server that brought the drink asked me to try it immediately to see if it was made well. I was surprised they would even ask and he stood there waiting for me patiently!  Next the food wasn't bad at all, or maybe I just haven't been exposed to good enough sashimi/sushi places but the Tako Wasabi appetizer was reaaaally tasty and INDEED quite APPETIZING! My ramen I decided to order was delicious (and I was also craving some ramen so it hit the spot) and the Tako sashimi I got after was great.  The place has a fancy kind of atmosphere with simple yet elegant decor.   I would definitely return to try their other dishes as they all seem so intriguing. Especially their Oyster special that we unfortunately missed out on because they ran out...in any case check this place out!"}
{"text":"Here it is folks my 1000th review, wow, what a wild ride to get to this point (a ride that packed on about 20 yelp pounds in 4 years)! I wanted to make this review special, and to simply review another AYCE sushi joint or the 100th burrito/burger or barber would just be sort of anti-climatic after such a lengthy run.   I hosted a little twitter/instagram/yelp contest to see who could make a case for the best review worthy spot in the 905. The suggestion by @dereknfood on Instagram, was Kiu Japanese Restaurant and they're freshly flown in daily fish had me hooked... literally. Derek was invited to join me on this experience and was an excellent DC.  Warning, if you've read my novels before, stop now if you don't have the time because this review may just become a tome* on sushi!   * Tome [thome] n. a book, especially a very heavy, large, or learned book.  TL:DR: Amazing high quality food, exceptionally well educated staff, higher price point. (4.5/5)  Kiu Japanese is hot and new on Yelp with 52 reviews. Don't let the 3/5 average dissuade you, this is will quickly rise to be one of the top Japanese/sushi spots in the entire Greater Toronto Area. Remember who said this first!  It's on the second floor of the new Cineplex plaza in the heart of what will be the new downtown core for Markham. To find it enter the Cineplex side of the plaza, head up the escalator and Kiu will be on your immediate right.  The experience begins the moment you walk in with a loud boisterous traditional Japanese greeting from the hostesses while they bow. That same greeting and bow is given by every staff member as you are walked to your table. It was a little awkward but you did really felt like a somebody and I challenge you to not crack a small smile.  While this is a Japanese restaurant it could easily pass for a fine dining establishment of any cuisine. The gold koi fish paintings on the black walls and the open sushi kitchen are the only signs of what this restaurant is. My one critique is the harsh white lighting, it's very hard on the eyes and I think with the vibe here they could stand to use a softer yellow light/maybe dim the house lights in the evening. Instagram users and food photogs, no need for flash.  Our server James came over and brought the 4 menus and basically sold our whole table on Asahi beer, which uses Japanese water. The most interesting thing of note about Asahi is that it holds its thick head the same way a pint of Guinness would, and it's delicious!  After enjoying our drinks for a bit, James explained what items were absolute must haves and how the order of food traditionally varies in Japanese meals. That order is; Sushi first, then hot and cold appetizers, then main course items followed at the end by a ramen course.   Here is the itemized list of everything we ordered in the order we received them and my brief thoughts on each:  SUSHI - 15pc Sashimi 8 kinds ($40) - 12pc of 4 Kinds of Sushi / 3pc each ($25) ** The sushi here is really unmatched. You can taste the freshness and the variety extends your palate beyond the usual suspects. Even slightly fishier variants are perfect. The pressed sushi is a must have - if you can get the salmon w/ jalapeno do it!  APPETIZER - KYOTO STYLE MILK TOFU ($6), a traditional Kyoto style Tofu steamed in milk, with a silky creaminess of custard - TAKOYAKI ($7), Deep fried battered octopus, topped with powdered seaweed, shaved bonito flakes & tonkatsu sauce. ** I'm not a tofu fan but this was more like a pudding, so soft and creamy! The takoyaki had far too much batter for my taste and they really OD'd on the bonito flakes, nice taste still.  FISH - SNOW CRAB CROQUETTES ($16), Deep fried snow crab, prawn, scallop, creamy croquettes served with original tomato & tartar sauces. ** Amazing, 2 croquettes per order perfect for sharing. The dipping sauce it heavenly.  MEAT - CHICKEN KARAAGE ($8), Deep fried chicken thigh served with spicy garlic mayo. - BEEF TATAKI ($12), Lightly seared beef tenderloin seasoned with a traditional soy vinaigrette dressing & garlic chips. -  MISO GLAZED BONE MARROW ($16), Grilled bone marrow glazed with sweet miso & cheese, garnished with black pepper, dill weed & served with a side of Garlic Cod Roe Bread. ** OMG. The chicken was unreal, perfectly cooked, seasoned and portioned. The tataki was also amazing, the toppings and vinaigrette were perfectly balanced and each bite was so refreshing! The bone marrow was 'OK' and did not come with enough toast.  RAMEN - ROASTED GARLIC SHOYU RAMEN ($11), Isshin roast garlic oil, bamboo shoots, nori, marinated soft boiled egg, pork belly cha shu, green onions & thin wavy noodles. * When this hit my table the server who brought it just said \"OMG this is so good\". He was right, it was top 2 Ramen I've ever had.  I have 50 characters left so I'll end by saying that Kiu is a must do. The price point is definitely very high, but that is the price for high quality. Worth it!!!  For the 1000th time EATCREST OUT!"}
{"text":"I would rate Kiu 3 stars, plus another 0.5 due to great service from our waiter.  Came here on a Saturday night to catch up with some friends. We didn't have a reservation so had to wait a good half hour before finally being seated. Unfortunately the host at the front was not the greatest and for some time had forgotten to seat our party. Also when we were brought inside we noticed that there were quite a few empty tables (some without reserved signs) so didn't understand the need for the long wait.  We ordered the chicken karaage, an appetizer set with nine different items, the red miso ramen, and the white sesame shio ramen to share amongst the three of us. I particularly enjoyed the appetizer set which contained various Japanese side dishes such as tako wasabi, grilled unagi, and beef tataki. The portions are very small but still recommended for sharing. The chicken karaage was tasty too. Both ramen dishes were disappointing, which is unfortunate as that is partly what they are supposed to be known for since they also own Ramen Isshin. The red miso ramen was too salty while the white sesame shio ramen was kind of bland. My friends also tried the black sesame cheesecake which was average.  If I ever come back, I would probably just order their appetizers."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Japanese restaurant with pleasant staff and good ramen. Bonus for awesome vegetarian ramen options.  Now I am new to the world of ramen, but I loved that Kiu had a vegetarian option. I don't eat pork or red meat which usually eliminates a lot of the popular ramen places. This broth was spicy and flavourful. We sat by the kitchen- friendly staff. The kitchen staff were all so polite and greeted us kindly.   Their menu had a little bit of everything. It wasn't a huge menu- but you can definitely find something to please everyone. It had options with a modern flare. Some sushi and sashimi options, appetizer options and dessert.  Id come here again. It's gorgeous and the service is great."}
{"text":"5 stars!  Kiu has partnered up with Isshin ramen to bring their ramen soups to markham!! I'm so happy I did this as I no longer have to drive downtown for this delicious soup.   Food:  Ramens -  All ramens are delicious! I've had the white sesame shio ramen, black sesame tan tan ramen and the roasted garlic shoyu. The latter is by far my favourite. Each flavor I've had has been consistent with their downtown toronto location.   My friends have also had the spicy ramens and vegetarian, all of which have said to be delicious and consistent as well.   Kyoto Style Milk Tofu $6.00 -  One block of silken tofu steamed in milk with a lobster topping. The textures and flavours actually have me craving this particular appetizer. If you're willing to pay $6.00 for a fancy block of tofu, I would recommend this to you. The flavours are 100% worth the price imo.   Chicken Karage $8.00 - Deep fried chicken served with spicy garlic mayo. We got 4 \"big\", juicy pieces. I say big because most versions that i've had come with several small pieces. Mayo was also satisfying.  Kiu specialty lobster maki roll $17.00 -  Torched maki roll. Came with 8 maki sized pieces (not that big, I thought it would be a bigger roll for the price). For the price, this maki roll is forgettable. The flavours were just okay. Will pass on this next time.  Drinks -  I normally try the random drink specials (they have one daily). Standout drink so far was the lychee mojito. I liked that the mint wasn't too overpowering.   Service -  Really polite, knowledgeable staff. They knew just when they were needed and when to leave you alone, my kind of service. They also made sure we had enough water throughout every service. Never had to ask for it ourselves.   Location:  @ Birchmount and Enterprise in the cineplex plaza in \"downtown markham\" plenty of free parking, the underground is a +++++ going into the winter season chatime in the same plaza, also a massive +++++ #majorkey. note - you'll be too full from the delicious food you just ate at Kiu. Get no ice in your drink, put it in your fridge and have it for breakfast!   Final thoughts -  This is my new go to spot for ramen. Interested in trying a lot of their other items (bone marrow, blow torched sushi, etc.) Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"For my first ever ramen experience, I'd say Kiu was a really great entrance into the ramen world, the ramen universe even. The ramen at Kiu is made by Ramen Isshin. Ramen Isshin is already a highly reputed place for ramen to begin with but what makes it even more desirable is the multiple vegetarian options that they offer.   Its sort of become standard now to include vegetarian options on a menu, no matter which restaurant you go to. But some places only include one menu item that is vegetarian *cough Kinton cough* which leaves no choice for the vegetarian person. So, good job Kiu/Ramen Isshin for adding multiple veggie options on your menu.  I got the spicy red miso veggie ramen and it was pretty good. Upon the first few bites, it didn't seem spicy but the heat really built up and by the end I could feel the heat in the back of my throat. It came with a variety of toppings including tofu, mushrooms, onions and also additional toppings you can add if you choose to (go with the egg, you won't be disappointed). We also got the Kiu cream soda which was a fruity mocktail that was surprisingly refreshing.   Kiu is on the second floor of the building with glass windows all around, but sadly the view on all sides of the restaurant aren't very good. One side looks into the escalators and movie theatre  and the other side faces the road/neighbouring building. Markham problems I guess, can't be helped.   Note: Get's busy on weekends so I'd recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"their food i guess is not bad if you've never had good, high quality experiences. Their ramen in general is acceptable but for its price, not at all. their completely overpriced and the portions are absolutely tiny. i really wouldn't come, even with friends cuz i really feel like i'm unnecessarily spending and wasting a lot of money."}
{"text":"I have frequented their DT starter Isshin Ramen and was very excited when they expanded to a larger location uptown! It's located a bit tucked away upstairs in a newly developed plaza but it was worth the trek! Plus lots of parking in suburbia. I had the red dragon ramen and it was so delicious! Initially I was nervous about the spiciness but it was more flavorful than hot. I did remove that red pepper tho! With 15 different spices in their paste, it's a burst of tangy chili oil with tons of vegetable with a rich broth. The egg was included too. As usual (I am a big fan of isshen) the ramen noodles were perfect chewy/al dente, and I ordered my standard extra pork (extra 2 pieces). We also ordered their assorted sushi platter - the shrimp and salmon was decadent! I will definitely be coming back. Authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on their soft opening. Very nice modern and dark decor and the staff were very polite. While waiting to be seated, we noticed how spacious the restaurant was but only half of it was used for the actual seating area. The other half was where the open sushi kitchen was.    We asked about the serving portion and was told it was izakaya style. However, the menu was very limited and it lacked a lot of the izakaya food options that I usually expect.   I ended up ordering the White Sesame Shio Ramen. The soup came hot and the soup base was very light and creamy, not too salty. The meat portion was less than I expected, I got two very thin pieces of cha su. At least the noodles were made perfect, not too soft or chewy.  Also tried the Kiu Beef Tatiki and Chicken Karaage, they were made well but the portion size is small. So you may have to order other dishes to fill you up. As well, they didn't have any rice dishes, boyfriend needed his carbs! So, we requested for a bowl of rice, which came out hot and fluffy!"}
{"text":"Overall - 2.0/5.0  Dropped by for their soft opening. Environment is modern, spacious and classy.   They position themselves to be an upscale Japanese restaurant from a pricing perspective but overall the food quality does not command it.  Light Shoyu Ramen - Soup base was lukewarm and flavours were one dimensional. Noodles did not come out al dente.  Lobster/Scallop Ceviche - The lime that came with the appetizer was dry and did not have any juice when you try to squeeze it over the top of the ceviche. Lobster texture was decently fresh but again, overall taste did not have much depth.  Pressed Sushi - Rice and topping separated as you pick it up. This was due to the rice being dry and stiff as if it was left out in open air for a while. Overall texture was not up to par at all. Folks who think this was good are either clueless or have had a little too much sake.  In terms of service, they try their best to be attentive and polite but it came off as scripted and unnatural. They definitely need more finesse so that they can present themselves more polished and seasoned when they interact with their guests.  Don't bother spending your money here. Make a trip out to Miku or JaBistro for the real deal."}
{"text":"If we look within this location ( markham, scar, etc), it's definitely a 5 star Japanese restaurant.  If I have to be honest with my tongue... Well, compare with those great Japanese restaurants (that I have tried so far) in downtown area, it may not be that outstanding. But it's still a super star in markahm/Scarborough for sure.  If you also live within this area like me and don't wanna drive 45min+ to downtown for miku, jabistro etc, pick Kiu and try their aburi :)   I love their aburi, sashimi, bone marrow(very Italian style), drum stick, Chirashi don and ramen... yea a lot lol. The only thing i dun like about is their chicken karage. Not juicy at all :( maybe I'm too picky, but just dun try it.  Great service. Very patient, honest recommendations, good looking girls and guys :P  Plus, they are right next to cineplex,  I think it's a perfect location for a date.  Been here twice and I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here twice and food is good depending on what your order, hit and miss here. Definitely I wouldn't go for their udon as their broth is really salty. I tired it twice as I thought it could have just been that day. Beef carpaccio is really good with the tart pomegranate seeds. Quite original compare to other restaurants. S"}
{"text":"Nice place, food average, but very annoying service. We r group of 4, every time when any of us finish the last bite, the server take the bowl away regardless we r in a conversation. At the end, right after the last person finish, server comes again........... They just like rush us to leave as soon as possible.......... Won't come again"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before a movie. The salmon carpaccio and edamame we had for starters were both good. I had the light shoyu ramen and it wasn't very flavourful. It was only just okay, not something I would order again. My friend had the pork ribs, which were meaty but that's all that came on the plate - just meat, no sides of any kind. She expected a bit of actual sweet potato but there was only a teaspoonful of sauce that we assumed was the sweet potato."}
{"text":"Doesn't worth the money at all. Sashimi are not fresh, and probably pre-make. We got it less than 5 minutes after the waitress told our order...  the sushi is like all you can eat, rice and fish are separate.  Won't come back for sure"}
{"text":"I have to say I was very impressed with what Kiu had to offer. I had been wanting to come for a while, since they had posted up that they would be opening soon. Had to wait a few weeks before they were officially open, but I guess it was worth the wait.  Decor here was quite nice and modern, giving it a very nice atmosphere. There were tons of windows to see the street and it would give it lots of natural lighting. Not sure how bright it would be during the day though.  We decided to get a ramen each and share the Kiu Beef Tataki and the Pressed Sushi. The Beef Tataki was really good, with a hint of citrus and zest flavor. Very well seared as well. The pressed sushi was quite a feature though, with 4 different kinds to try. There were Angus Beef with green onions and garlic, Salmon with habanero sauce, Yellowtail with miso paste, and Mackerel with ginger. Each one was unique and had a wonderful twist to their taste, with every topping matching nicely with the fish (or meat). For ramen, we had the White Sesame Shio Ramen, the Black Sesame Tan Tan Noodle, and the Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen. The White Sesamie Shio was very nice with a lighter soup base. The Black Sesame Tan Tan was a stronger flavor that seemed saltier in comparison. Both gave you their respective sesame on the side for you to pestle to your own liking and add into your ramen. The Roasted Garlic Shoyu was quite strong in flavor, with the oil over top making it quite heavy. Depending on what you fancy, their ramen options give you something to look forward to. For dessert, we got the Matcha Roll Cake with red bean paste. On their special menu for the day and made beautifully, it was quite a nice pairing of flavors without the matcha too overpowering.  Service was very good here, with extremely attentive staff and servers. Everyone that saw you walk in welcomed you (in Japanese) and even bowed slightly if they could. Gave you different tea options to start and even explained dishes as they were brought to the table. All servers were very friendly and soft spoken, which was quite nice overall.  Definitely going to be coming back here for some of the other dishes on the menu. Everything seems to have had lots of thought put in and worth going to try. Definitely going to do well in this area!"}
{"text":"I give 2 stars for the service and the decent ramen. -3 cause of a few things.    The bone marrow. 16 dollars for oil and 4 thin slices of bread. I am not paying 16 dollars to lubricate my throat. As I'm typing this I feel the oil sitting on my throat. Apparently I'm suppose to taste some \"rich\" buttery bone marrow but all I got was canola oil.   Everything was over priced, and salty. The dishes are unique compared to other Japanese places like this, however i wouldn't pay 19 dollars for an appetizer dish that taste like salty dirt.   Anyways. -2 for quality based on the price, -1 for disappointing me with that bone marrow dish.   If you want to try something new and get this off your bucket list, come try this place out. After your experience I guarantee you'll feel the same as me."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the waitresses are AWFUL. We made the reservation for 6 but wait there for half hour and nobody seated us. What's the point for reservation?"}
{"text":"This night back in June was a double first.  It was my first ever omakase experience and it was also Kiu's first day offering omakase.  It included miso soup, dessert and 18 courses, 13 of which were sushi.  It was an awesome experience and would definitely recommend it.  The food was awesome and the service was exceptional.  Be aware though, the whole experience lasted 4 hours!  They only do one seating at 7pm.  See below for a quick review of some of the food we had.  The omakase started with a milk tofu topped with quinoa, uni and purple yam.  The milk tofu was firm but smooth and full of flavour.  We were then served 4 pieces of sushi (one at a time) which included sea bream, tuna, mackerel and squid.  The sixth course was herring roe on kelp.  Then we got 3 more pieces of sushi: medium fatty tuna, geoduck and conger eel.  The conger eel was torched before the chef served it.  After the sushi, we had a slow cooked abalone with a side of sansho pepper.  The pepper has a bit of a tangy and minty flavour, it also made our tongues tingly.  Then came the rare nodoguro (rosy seabass or blackthroat sea perch) was served two ways, deep fried or grilled.  We tried them both and definitely enjoyed the the grilled one more.  The fish itself is very fatty and buttery, and deep frying it made it a bit too heavy.  After nodoguro, we had a flounder sushi and two pieces of uni sushi, male and female.  The female uni was much lighter in taste and the male one was very overpowering.  There were a few more courses, then came the fatty tuna, then a few more courses after that. Dessert was also amazing, Japanese pana cotta and warabi mochi.  They told me most of their fish is flown in fresh from Japan's Tsukijii Market twice a week!"}
{"text":"Food here is decent. The chawanmushi and beef tataki were delicious, but the stuffed chicken wings (nothing special), ebi mayo (too sour and not crispy) and aburi sushi (warm and not very fresh) were disappointing. Would want to come back and try the ramen as I saw a bunch of tables around me ordering the ramen. What I loved about this place is the atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and beautiful with a casual feel. The service was also great. I would come back again, but definitely not for the sushi."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday before a movie. I only had 1 hour to spare. My husband order the Scallop Salad and said it was one of the best he had in a long time. He also ordered the Crab Croquet's and said they were delicious too. I had the chopped Tuna sushi rolls, they were good, nothing too amazing about a simple maki roll. I also had the stuffed chicken wing. The flavour on the wings were yummy! the stuffing inside was good too nothing amazing but good. The Berry Berry Sangria i ordered however, brought bake memories of Spain! I have yet to have such an authentically amazing sangria anywhere else since my vacation.  Most places drown it in sprite but not this place, it was so good that you couldn't even taste if there was sprite in there at all. That is a true Sangria. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"this is my favourite place to go to for lunch dates. the ramen is delicious, high quality, and not too pricey. the atmosphere is always amazing and the restaurant is big enough so that you won't have to wait long to be seated. the service is very friendly as well. the menu has a wide selection of items so you'll be able to please everyone :) highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, decently priced. Surprisingly, the ramen is a big focus in there-- Had the garlic shoyu ramen, strong garlic flavour over ride the actual soup taste so I would recommend getting the kotteri rich shoyu instead where u can actually taste the creaminess of the broth. Lunch menu is limited in choices but overall food presentation and taste was good (we also had chirashi don--very authentically made). Nice decor and conveniently located so you can hop over to the movies right after dinner~"}
{"text":"Took the wife here today for dinner, grabbed a few dishes.     First thing I noticed was the diversity of people working here.   The whole staff pitches in and are quite courteous.   When our plates were brought out, staff took the time to explain each dish.  We started with a Japanese milk tofu.   This was delicious.  Never had something like this.  It was dense sweet with a fresh flavour.  Next course was a seared tuna.   It was wrapped in seaweed and lightly breaded on the outside.    We had an appetizer sampler, which was small portions but lots of items to try  We had a 9 piece nigari , which was good.   It came with 1 piece of eel on rice in a bowl with seaweed on the side ( like a build it yourself Maki)  Other items we had was a stuffed chicken wing dumpling, pork belly on a Edamame puree, and their signature poached lobster roll.  The lobster roll was really was really tasty, it had some braised sauce on top.  We finished off the meal with a coffee panacotta, with a raspberry puree.  And topped with (I think) a sweetened Edamame whipped topping.    All in all a great meal and a great night out.   It's not the cheapest thing available, but they do have lots of creative dishes to try and they have a great staff to make suggestions as well."}
{"text":"Service is attentive and accommodating to my special seating request!! Online booking was so easy from yp. Review email requested via email.  Foods are fresh and creative. Servers are friendly and cheerful.  Our server was proactively helpful and offered suggestion. She often checked on us.  We were happy to have a delicious dinner on a very busy night.  Overall, good quality food and service. We enjoyed it. Price is on a high side but fresh food and the overall experience worth it.  Happy servers and great good Japanese food!! Will return. Money were well spent for food, service and pleasant vibe overall"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm definitely a fan of this place - I think I just found my new *fancier* Japanese spot in Markham. The missing star is because there's just no comparison with the gems of downtown Toronto but given Kiu's location uptown, I have to say it's probably now one of my top options to \"impress someone special/new\".  What I especially like about this place aside from the stylish and classy interior is that they offer a variety of menu items at different price ranges. I came around lunch and it seemed most people had ordered ramen, which surprisingly was actually affordable ($10-14)! I tried the red miso ramen combo (+ takoyaki) with a side of an egg and everything was so good!! The ramen itself had a yummy bouncy texture and the broth was so pleasantly flavorful. The egg arrived as a side dish and cut in half, which was so smart because unlike other places that just throw your egg into the soup which overcooks it, their egg WAS PERFECTLY soft boiled to display a golden yellow viscous, gooey center that wasn't too runny nor overcooked. The takoyaki was also very delicious, having a crisp outter shell and each encasing 2 pieces of octopus.   I also tried the 6pc scallop aburi and the aburi set. Truth be told, I can't help but to compare all of my new experiences of scallop sashimi to Jabistro so I gotta say I wasn't TOO impressed with the scallop aburi (although it certainly wasn't bad - my expectations are just high). The aburi combo though came with a nice, fresh variety of options and was thoroughly enjoyable.   I will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the service and zero for the food. I had high expectation to this restaurant base on their interior design and price level (let's have a comparison with Japanese restaurants at the same price level: Inatei in Markham or Jabistro in DT). But I am totally wrong. I came here for lunch, ordered Sashimi Combo- $26 and Matcha Taro Crepe Cake - $8.5. This lunch costs total of $38.99 and this count as a luxurious lunch, right?   Sashimi Combo- $26, came with chopped tuna with green onion on top, 2 pieces of each of their daily selection sashimi. The most memorable pieces are Chopped Tuna and Bonitos. I will not judge the freshness of Bonito because it seems like is my first time to try this fish (I know the name of this fish because it tasted so bad that I had to asked the server. ?Correct me if I am wrong as I searched this fish online and found \"Bonito has a very strong blood scent close to meat, and they have to be extra fresh for sushi./ The bonito have a very strong smell of blood, so they are quickly butchered and chilled. Bonito was rarely eaten raw until the tataki method prevented food poisoning and was usually dried. \" (Credit to http://www.sushiencyclopedia.com/sushi_fish/bonito.html)  My question is why could Kiu put this into my $26 lunch combo? Also, the Chopped Tuna had an extremely fishy odour ( I know this isn't fresh because I had tuna before!). I had to eat that sashimi with a lot of wasabi, A LOT!  After the lunch combo, I saw some nice photos on Yelp of their dessert and I want to have something sweet to wash the fishy odour in my mouth (I really should not do this so I could save $8.5). I saw Matcha Taro-Crepe Cake was on today's menu and I was like ?\"you cannot go wrong with Matcha!'') Can someone who had tried their Matcha Taro-Crepe Cake tell me how is taste like? Because it tasted weird to me. I had tried crepe cakes from many places such as Lady M in NYC, N9 Cafe, Bake Code and Millie Cafe. None of them tasted like sour and perhaps the cream inside/ between layers. I know the cake was not freshly made because it was lunch time, so probably overnight. I ate crepe cakes overnight before. Maybe their crepe cake does taste sour because they put sour indigents? If so, this is not my taste at all.   I read many good reviews on Yelps from other Elit Yelpers, but I really, REALLY did not have the experience as they described on those reviews."}
{"text":"Hmm having read the reviews on here, I was expecting this place to live up to all the hype. Came during lunch during the holidays and was surprised at how busy the place was given it's location in Downtown Markham (most were movie goers which explains it).  We ordered two lunch sets - chirashi and the black cod, and also ramen with the additinal karaage chicken between us which were reasonably priced. Everyone seemed to enjoy their sets however I found my black cod to be quite fishy tasting. Maybe next time if I return I will just try the ramen.  Given the choices around, it's pretty much a captive audience so give it a go if you're looking to have some decent Japanese food."}
{"text":"I tried to like it based on reviews...but was not impressed whatsoever. The food is super expensive and did not taste as great as the price.   Beef tataki- it was good, 8 thin slices, probably the best thing we ordered. Pressed sushi - okay so..I don't understand this concept of sushi with too much mushy rice and a super thin layer of seared whatever it is. The waiter didn't explain what each were and we couldn't tell either lol and with that price danggggggg girl Red tuna carpaccio- slightly fried which gave it a nice crunch. Tasted like a normal red tuna roll, wasnt wowed and could've lived without it. Octopus- mediocre slices of Octopus with red onion. Honestly, the onions was the main star here. Specialty Kiu lobster roll - it was good, but wasn't anything special. Tasted like any other lobster roll (I.e the one at Kibo)  Miso cod - nice and tender, great Miso taste, the only problem was there was no crispness to it as you usually do with the skin Garlic shoyu ramen - he brought out the bowl and I legit asked is this  a small? Nope it was a regular for 11$ . There are so many other great ramen place in downtown, especially black ramen at sansotei if you are looking for great garlic taste. The broth was good, the 2 thin as heck slices of pork were nearly non existent, egg was great, 3 pieces of bamboo shoots yayyyy me.   Anyhow, we skipped on their offer of the 2 dessert they had and went downstairs to grab some cha time.   Overall this restaurant was a big Merp. For the same quality, go to Kaka.  It's all you can eat sushi buffet, has the same quality food (even pressed sushi for those who like that stuff) , and is cheaper."}
{"text":"Kiu is located on the second floor right beside the Markham Cineplex entrance at Enterprise and Birchmount in Downtown Markham.  The decor is modern and service is pretty good.  You definitely do not have an izakaya feel but more like a large Japanese restaurant instead.  We came for lunch and ordered:  - Tonkatsu Lunch Set ($16) The tonkatsu (breaded fried pork cutlet) is done a bit differently than usual.  The cutlet is stuffed with a bit of greens.  That was a nice touch, however the problem with this set is the cutlet is very, very dry.  The sauce is a must otherwise it's like eating dry stale meat.  The presentation is nice - Garlic Shoyu Ramen + 2pc Karaage ($14) The portions for their ramen is on the smaller side.  Adding a side of 2 pieces of Karage chicken for $3 is a must.  However, I wish I requested more noodles.  The ramen noodles here are the thin ones with good texture.  Broth is flavourful - Miso Ramen ($14) Miso ramen has a very salty broth.  The flavour is very rich and different than the typical shio or shoyu based broths.  It would be better if it was less salty, but I did enjoy it more than the Garlic Shoyu Ramen. - Special Lobster Maki Roll ($17) Unfortunately they don't have many maki rolls choices at Kiu.  They only have the very basic options of cucumber roll, egg (tamago), chopped salmon, chopped tuna.  They also have the lobster special roll which is expensive and definitely not worth the price.  There is zero lobster flavor and really just tastes no different than a california roll with torched tuna on top.  The tuna overwhelms the roll and that is the main flavour.  Overall I think Kiu is no more than 3 stars.  I would only come back to try different ramen flavours as they have quite a few on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by Kiu when they first opened and was honestly was never a fan at the beginning. However I would say that it's easily becoming one of my go to places for a la carte sushi.  Food: The cuisine is pretty standard for a Izakaya style restaurant. You will have a good variety of choices for both the lunch and dinner menu. For my dining experience, I choose to opt into having various appetizers and a few orders of sushi. Execution of dishes are not mind blowing but it's good for what it is. Safe to say I enjoyed the takowasabi, takoyaki, any of their Maki and torched pressed sushi.   Didn't find the Pork Belly Kakuni to mesh well as a whole but I did enjoy Pork Belly itself.   Bonus: Tuesday $5 Sapporo pints are a huge draw for me to continuously return.   Service: Staff are attentive and provide proper Mies en plas. Water top ups are quite frequent and they always inquire if you need further assistance. Everything is done by the books and pretty straightforward but not mindblowing.  Ambiance: Open kitchen concept with lots of seating. Clean and comfortable with a quite intimate atmosphere. Good choice location to bring a date or a group.   Recommendation: Kiu is a good recommendation for a decent dinning location. I wouldn't say it's bad nor would I say it's anything special but what they do in execution and the provide atmosphere is hard to argue against not going to this establishment. An easy yes in my books."}
{"text":"Husband and I had lunch there for the first time.  Two of us ordered an appetizer, a Chirashi bowl and an other cooked fish dish.  We were extremely disappointed with the Chirashi which was a bowl of rice with  assorted raw fish on the top.  The fish slices were terribly thin and tiny (most thickness were almost like paper thin and the sizes were like men's finger nail.  We are Japanese food lovers but have never had such a terrible experience with a dish.  It's not only the raw fish pieces were thin and tiny, they were cuts from the fish scrap, odd and ends.  And the Chirashi was not cheap, it's $20 and we paid about $80 for just this simple lunch.  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Sad, they took away any Miso based ramen. Including our all time favorite Red Dragon ramen. Still love their Chirashi but that also increased in price recently. Will be returning but probably just not as often!"}
{"text":"Visited for 2nd time, just because it's right beside the theater.  First time experience was horrible.  There were 3 servers that were like satellites around our table and kept changing our plates non stop!   This time, it's a bit better, less plate change, but again, kept collecting our plates too quickly while we're just trying to have a chat.    Food is not bad, but not amazing.  Location is good, easy to find parking at night.    Will I come back again, yes, because of the location."}
{"text":"New Japanese restaurant just located in the Markham VIP cinema. Friendly staff and service is very efficient."}
{"text":"Best thing was the bone marrow!!! Had the Sashimi platter most of it was pretty fresh but the squid was disappointing. Stuffed chicken wings was okay, pretty average. Do not recommend press sushi. We also ordered Otoro and uni sushi which was fresh and yum! Overall is a decent place, just don't order press sushi lol"}
{"text":"Came here a little while ago because the food looked really good! Had to say I was a little disappointed though..   The decor of the place was pretty nice and I liked how it was set up! We were quickly greeted by a server and luckily there was a table for us.   I ordered the takoyaki and the mini sashimi bowl (forgot what it's called but it has roe and like two pieces of sashimi and cooked white fish on top of rice) and it was okay. I did not like the fish bowl because a) the cooked white fish meat had SCALES in there.. it was rather unpleasant, and b) the sashimi pieces were small and it might as well not even be there tbh. Majority of the bowl was the cooked white fish and rice. The takoyaki was a 7.5/10.   Service was okay too. I originally just wanted the okonomiyaki and takoyaki but our server did not inform us that the okonomiyaki was sold out until AFTER I told her I wanted it. I used to be a server and typically you're supposed to tell the customer before they order (I.e. when they sit down) to avoid false hope and extra time for ordering. I was pretty bummed out but it was not a big deal. Our server wasn't exactly the friendliest but we all have our off-days so, who knows.   Overall I'll probably go back to try their sushi (because I feel like this place is more known for that) but based on my first experience, it probably won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Makunouchi Box contained 8 chef sampler appetizers which was served in a traditional bento box. In our box that day -- the selection changes seasonally -- we had black cod, beef tataki, tuna jelly, sausage, mackerel, anchovies, tofu topped with some kind of bean, and ikura. It was absolutely a beautiful assortment of appetizers that you wouldn't normally get to eat.  I would definitely recommend getting the Makunouchi Box since it was something so different from your ordinary Japanese eats. I had a great time trying each of the eight appetizers in the bento box!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for his belated birthday dinner. A super busy place on a Saturday evening, so I definitely recommend making a reservation before showing up even if it's just for 2 people. Our reservation was made for 6:30pm, but my friend wasn't able to show up at the table until 10 minutes before 7 because of parking. Like I mentioned earlier in my review for the cinema, parking is a pain in this plaza during prime times, so always get here earlier if you can.   We ordered the Seafood Carpaccio from the Chef's Specials, the Grilled Oyster, the 12 piece of 4 kinds Aburi Oshi Sushi, and the Tsukemen to share. The Seafood Carpaccio came with 3 pieces of Sakura-ebi, and 3 pieces of Scallop sashimi with a combination of many different sauces presented on the plate. One of the sauces stood out to me because it had hints of cilantro in it. I'm usually not a big fan of cilantro in anything as it has a very strong smell and taste, but it worked well with the fresh sashimi and other sauces. The Grilled Oyster came with 2 medium sized oysters in the shell topped with spicy cod roe mayo, cheese, crispy panko bread, dill weed, and fish eggs. It was grilled to perfection, not too raw, and not overcooked. The spicy cod mayo wasn't spicy at all and this is coming from someone who has a low tolerance to spice. As for the 12 piece of 4 kinds Aburi Oshi Sushi (pressed and torched sushi), I'm no expert in fish, but I recall torched salmon to be one and another kind to be shrimp. Check out the photo, if you can tell what the other 2 kinds were. This was also served with two pieces of Tamago (egg) on the side. Each of the 4 kinds were topped and seasoned differently, but all tasted very good in their own unique way. Lastly, we had the Tsukemen which is a rich style of Shoyu dipping Ramen where the broth is served separately from the noodles. The noodles are thicker than your usual ramen and are cooked al dente. This type of ramen is meant to be dipped because the broth is very rich and strongly flavoured with Ishhin Shoyu so the noodles do not have to be soaked in it to retain the flavours. I personally like ramen served in the broth, but I'm always up for trying something new.   Some people consider this a more expensive Japanese fusion restaurant, but I think you're paying for the quality of what you get so I find the prices to be quite reasonable. You're seated comfortably and the service is good. I'll definitely be back to try some other menu items  cause one can only eat so much in one sitting."}
{"text":"Food (3/5) KYOTO STYLE MILK TOFU $6.00 (4/5 stars) - tasted very interesting. There were edible flower pieces and small chunks of shellfish.  Personally, I am not a fan of milk but had ordered it for husband who normally likes steamed milk type of food.  Overall, tasty, refreshing. Unique.  Was disappointed that staff were not knowledgeable enough to advise the names of the edible flower pieces for which I expect at this type of restaurant.  I give four out of five stars because while interesting in taste, I wouldn't go back just to have it again.  SNOW CRAB CHAWAN MUSHI $9.00 (2.5/5 stars) - seasonal ingredients overpowered the dish.  At order, I had expected this dish to be somewhat similar to those steamed eggs at AYCE but more phenomenal in taste with a strong crab flavour.  Unfortunately, it had not only failed to deliver expectations but fell subpar to some of the AYCE steamed eggs.  Definitely will not order this again, if we go back.  PRESSED SUSHI $19.00 (2/5 stars) - Super disappointed with this dish.  Torched sushi: white tuna, ebi shrimp, scallops, salmon.  They all had specially paired ingredients such as coriander sauce for the ebi shrimp, sweet jam? for scallops, and slight spicy mustard mayo for salmon.  While the dish looked fancy, the sauces all overpowered the torched sashimi pieces to the point that I didnt even feel like I ate sushi.  Rice was too sweet, somewhat hard, sashimi pieces tasted over-torched and felt dry.  I suppose this dish is good for those who normally don't like sushi and need other ingredients to cover up the fish taste.  After this dish, I was apprehensive about ordering other sashimi / sushi type items.    MISO GLAZED BONE MARROW $16.00 (3/5) - the description on the menu did not mention anything about cheese on this dish.  Description is  \"Grilled bone marrow in a sweet miso glaze, garnished with black pepper, dill weed & served a side with garlic toasted croutons. wt mk\".  However, the actual dish is covered in cheese.  Personally not a huge fan of cheese at times and would have liked to have known ahead of time especially since it is sprinkle-covered and melted over top.  The cheese made the dish very \"??\".  IMO, it also over powered the dish.  It tasted sweet oil with cheese.  I enjoyed that there were croutons to catch those bone marrow oil.  Also liked that the dish came out really hot.  Wish the cheese / seasoning had been less over-powering.  SAKE STEAMED CLAMS $14.00 (3.5/5) -   To be continued"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. They serve really high quality food here. We got LA kalbi, sushi, and aburi pressed sushi. The LA Kalbi was good, portion was decent. The sushi though... Similar to high quality ones in Vancouver , really good! I had aburi sushi before but sometimes it can be strong in sesame oil but this restaurant makes it really good. Since it's a la carte, it can be costly but why not treat yourself to this amazing place. Service and overall hygiene was good too."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10pm since website said it close at 11:30pm and I was starving for a late late dinner. Got to the front desk to be greeted but no one was there. Servers at the bar can see us waiting but still no service. Waited about 6 minutes before someone came  to finally ask us if we wanted a table. Finally got a table and place was kind of empty. Roughly about 6 tables were seated and eating but that's it. We ordered a bunch of items to share and it arrived promptly. Our server was nice and food was delicious. A bit on the small portion side ... we ordered the appetizer sampler, 12pc sushi, stuffed chicken wings, tea and a kiu-cream soda. Finished everything but was still hungry so hubby ordered a red miso Ramen.  Everything was delicious no complaints. Food is good but not sure if it's worth the money for the portions you get. You might walk out hungry. Overall presentation is pretty."}
{"text":"Real authentic Japanese. Nice balance of flavours and we notice the difference in freshness and quality of the ingredients. Have gone a few times and consistently good meals as we continue to try new dishes."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick dinner before watching a movie.   Pros: Service was excellent  Immediately got seated Sushi was super fresh Ramen was chewy and delicious soup base.   Cons:  Tables are small  Can get noisy if there's a big group nearby    We got Lucky and was able to order the last piece of blue fin tuna bone, awesome treat. Scrape out the fresh tuna with a small spoon, it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Ok since this is Japanese food week for me, let me catch up on some of my Japanese foodie reviews :p  Kiu is one of the newer Japanese restaurants in Markham. Not authentically owned or run.  Just so happened our server that day was Japanese.  I started with a lovely cocktail with a lychee flavour. Delicious! My hopes began to get high.  We ordered an appetizer sampler, sushi sampler, stuffed dumpling chicken wings, a chashu ramen and takoyaki balls.  Not only were my hopes high so were the prices.  Which I presume is almost acceptable due to the area in which it's located. It's in the 2nd level of the new Cineplex VIP building in downtown Markham.  However the food really didn't warrant the prices.   The takoyaki balls were excellent. Not too much batter and contained a large piece of tako. It was topped with plenty of bonito flakes (which I love).  That was the best dish of the night.   All of the food was good, but didn't leave any wow factors in my mind that made the experience so in memorable that I would say I'd definitely go back.  All the sushi pieces including the pressed pieces were torched, there was no way for me to tell how fresh the fish actually was.  The ambiance and services were excellent.   I think I may give it another chance an maybe try it one more time."}
{"text":"To sum up the place in one phrase: JaBistro/Izakaya pricing at all-you-can-eat quality. Utterly disappointed. I expected a lot based on the recent \"hype\" of this place. I should've known better as this was just a Chinese-owned \"Japanese\" restaurant in Markham. I've been to many, many Japanese restaurants and this is by far the worst out of any non-all-you-can-eat places. I was fooled by their strong marketing on Instagram. Sashimi was so-so, slightly better than AYCE but not the freshest. Pressed/Blow-torched sushi was about the level of Kaka. Hot food was HORRIBLE. Service was okay, nothing spectacular. Food was SLOW, like REAL SLOW. Constantly sitting there with nothing on the table between each dish. Due to the location (downtown Markham), it's become more like a family-type restaurant, instead of the high-end Japanese restaurant they claim to be (not their fault, it's just the demographics here). Clean-up is done like any regular Chinese restaurant (not so customer-friendly). Rather go to Guu (Kinka) for better food at lower price."}
{"text":"Great spot next to the VIP Cinemas!  Really delicious food, prompt service and vibrant ambiance.  Definitely recommend sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Great service, fresh sushi and a wonderful decor. The staff to customers ratio was insane (lots of staff).  Ramen tastes great, but small portion. Rice on the sushi was perfectly textured, flavored and oiled. The stuffed chicken wings tasted exactly like a Chinese dumpling.  Wish their menu was a little more unique, to match the fabulous space."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a weekday lunch: menu has surprising amount of variety from sushi/sashimi, ramen and \"fast food\" like okonomiyaki. Normally I would say it's better for a restaurant to focus on one style, but they did a decent job pulling off each from what we sampled and lunch prices were reasonable.   I can't comment on dinner selection, but would be willing to return to try it.   Ramen broth was creamy, flavourful and not overly oily or flat. Chewy noodles with nice selection of toppings. I also liked the large wooden ladle they provide for drinking the soup. Would definitely try again!!  Pressed sushi was a mixed bag. Scallop was bland but the shrimp, tuna and salmon had nice flavour combos (coriander cream, jalapeño, edible flowers etc.). Sushi rice a little dry though.   Sashimi combo had fresh flavours and nice presentation.   Service needed some prodding: had to ask both times on what we were eating -- what kind of oysters ($1/special!)? What are the different pressed sushi on the platter? But otherwise competent.   Washrooms were clean and I liked that each stall was a separate room with sink.   Decor was modernish and dark. Enjoyed the booth overlooking the Marriott next door."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for the very first time. This place doesn't disappoint. I love the fact this establishment has adopted to use online reservations. The decor is modern and very well ventilated. Just one thing, the volume of the music can be turn down a bit? Can't really have a conversation.   Onto the food. As it's my first time at this place, I checked out the reviews and flipped through the many pictures available. I decided on the Tsukemen. First time ever trying the dipping ramen ever. This did not disappoint at all. The soup was rich and flavourful but not over salty or overpowering, hence just right. There was a subtle taste of seafood in the soup. Dipping the noodle and other ingredients made this even more flavourful. After dipping the noodle into the soup, the noodle was still al dente. I like! I think I just jumped the gun. haha! We ordered a bunch of appetizers, chicken karaage, spicy salmon hand roll, slow roast pork rib and a dozen oysters. Let's start, the spicy salmon hand roll was fresh and I can still taste the freshness of the salmon even it was mixed in with the spicy mayo. At the same time, the rice and seaweed was still fresh. The oysters were fresh. But to me, the slow roast pork rib was the star. This literally falls off the bone and still juicy. The chicken karaage was made just right. It was juicy and tender, still flavourful. I like that a lot. So food's overall experience is right up there.   Service wise, the staff are very attentive. I guess the only critique I have was the price. But it's worth the price, that I can say."}
{"text":"A late review! I enjoyed dining here for Valentines day. I tried their special vday special along with a ramen bowl since they are known for it. Would say the noodles are almost on par with best in the city Sensotei. As for the special, each dish was cute and small delicately portioned, also nothing to complain as it was tasty.  Prices are a bit high for sure.  Would come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of sushi places, so this place was really expensive for the quality, and the pressed/torched sushi was so disappointing - barely any flavour and cold. It wasn't well pressed either, the rice kept breaking in half once I dabbed it into the soy sauce.    The spicy salmon roll was good for the price - I believe $8.   The Tuna (6 pcs in 3 types, 2 ways, I believe) that was $32 was really good - only thing that was notable from my experience there.  I wouldn't go back there. Overrated place, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Kiu is a great source of confusion for me. It started with me flip flopping on my decision to try this place with every new review on Yelp: \"Get the sushi, it's amazing\", \"Worst sushi ever\", \"Ramen tastes so good!\", \"Ramen is overpriced\". Well, I finally put on my big girl pants and made my way over to formulate my own opinions. My verdict? I'm still confused.   First things first, the food that I tried was tasty. There's no denying that. I got the Chirashi Don and my SO got the Shio ramen with a side of Karaage (fried chicken, great deal at 2 pieces for an extra $3). Shio ramen was on the salty side of acceptable, but it is salt-based so it only makes sense.   The confusion for me comes from the Chirashi Don, which is essentially an assortment of cleanly sliced sashimi over a bed of rice (seasoned or not). It's supposed to be simple and highlight the freshness of the fish. Kiu's Chirashi Don was the opposite of simple. It had random pieces of all types of fish, pickled plum, bits of Japanese styled egg, salmon roe...and everything in between.   Taste-wise, it was pretty good. Towards the end though, I was not enjoying the fish at all. At first, it was cut in neat little chunks which later became shreds of fish, with parts that seem like they were rejects from other dishes (e.g. there was some black cod skin bits and a shred of salmon with some bone??). The fish shouldn't be the worst thing in a Chirashi Don. I mean, at this point, is it even correct to call it such?? When your fish is fishy, that just ain't right  I'm leaning towards giving this a slightly above average rating at 3.5. Food was ok, not the best, but ok. Service was spectacular. Imagine walking into a restaurant and having every staff member greet you. The menu and specials were explained in great detail and water was constantly refilled. So yes, call it overpriced, call it delicious, call it whatever. Depending on what you order, Kiu can be all of those things!  (83/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Kiu has really amazing torched sushi and the first torched sushi I have tried so i really don't have much to compare to. However, their rolls are very much lacking, I forgot which one, but I got one for $17 and it was extremely disappointing. So if you are to get sushi at Kiu, get the aburi and not their maki specialty rolls. As for the aburi, I got the platter for $30 to try 3 of each type. My favourite was the salmon one, would highly recommend! On top of that, we also got their takoyaki, which was pretty good and their pork belly kakuni which was also very small portion, but quite tender. Overall, the food would be rated 3.5/5 but the price for it all was not worth except for the aburi. Might return again to try their ramen. Service and atmosphere was quite good and attentive tho, 4/5."}
{"text":"I've come here on several occasions for a nice place to dine with a small or large party. The convenience is that it is actually less busy than when it first opened and usually able to get seating and get a table without difficulty. It is an easy place to think of the is located in the heart of downtown Markham  Location: Located right inside the Cineplex movie theatre, you can find their upscale dining restaurant on the 2nd floor of this building. Parking lot elevator can lead you right to the floor of the restaurant and at same level as your local Goodlife gym.  DATE: Watch a movie and have a meal or the order in reverse.  Atmosphere: This is a family friendly/kid/baby friendly restaurant. It is quite spacious and allows space for your strollers, your high chairs and good spacing between all the tables. The best thing is that you can feel like you are dining in a more \"nicer\" family restaurant but not have to dress the part (very casual vibe for sure).   Food: I can eat my torched sushi meals here or great ramen here as well! I've ordered a lot of different things from the menu and had no complaints with the food.  Things that are my FOR SURE \"GO TO\" menu items that I order over and over again each time I'm here is:  Torched aburi sushi platter - Great to order to share with your group. My fav one would be the salmon one! If I had to compare this to my all time fave torched sushi restaurant --- hands down JABISTRO though (*also had reviewed*).   Isshin ramen - white sesame shio soup base with thin noodles - the small size, sadly is pretty small portion (but this just allows us to make room to eat other things!!). You are able to select large or small size. You get your own little sesame seed to grind up to sprinkle into your ramen soup. The soup base is delicious and just has a nice light flavour to it.  I have also tried their other flavours (all quite good) but my fav is usually the milky light flavoured broth!  Service: If you have ever sat at the bar, the bar tender is really friendly and is great to serve you up a drink that you want (can also offer recommendations). I think their staff is very friendly and helpful even on those busy days.   I LOVE coming here for the location, the space, and the ease of getting a table at odd hours."}
{"text":"Pricey and mediocre service. I ordered the miso cod, lobster roll, snow crab cakes, bone marrow and stuffed chicken wings. I liked the miso cod and bone marrow the most. The only reason I'm rating this place a 3 was because there was hair in my food (the lobster roll) I was quite disappointed as it's an upper scale Japanese restaurant and the chefs were all wearing hats. The snow crab cakes I felt was very mushy inside, tasted kind of like a puree and the stuffed chicken wing was nothing special. The miso cod was cooked well and the sauce complemented the dish well. The bone marrow was tasty and went well with the baguette provided. I felt the pricing was high for what you get and the service wasn't the greatest. I would probably not be returning."}
{"text":"got two bowls of ramen here one of the Tokyo light shoyu ramen and the other was the koterri rich shoyu ramen  both came with bamboo shoots seaweed scallions pork and soft boiled egg  the presentation was very beautiful along with the restaurant ambience the windows and the cool view  both ramens were $13 and they came quickly the portions were average  I really like the spoon the gave us to eat it made it fun. the ramen I got was the kotteri rich, the soup was very flavourful, similar to sansotei, can't drink too much or it will be too salty. the pork was very tender and melted in my mouth and the egg was cooked perfectly  the Tokyo light in my opinion taste the same, apparently it was supposed to be a lighter version but didn't see a difference  the service here is quick which was great  would I come here again probably because it is right in the movie theatres"}
{"text":"Fish is incredibly fresh. Cute frosty the snowman dessert. Will definitely come back to try more. The light shoyu ramen broth was just so so...will try other ramen types for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and each time the food does not disappoint. The best things on the menu are the bone morrow and the Tsukemen (ramen noodles that come with bubbling hot soup on the side for dipping). Service is amazing had a great conversation with the sushi chef !"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe Kiu is related to Kingyo / Isshin.  The ramen was ok (but they charge more $$,  being the uptown location).  Just stay away from any raw fish dishes as they were terrible (chirashi and sashimi platter...who would ever thought of putting raw fish on FRIED FISH?  All you smell is oil)"}
{"text":"I've been to Kiu numerous times ever since it first opened. The first few times, I thought the food and service were fantastic with decent portions for a very reasonable price. I would have happily given this place 4 out of 5 stars back then. But in the last six months, I've noticed the portions have gotten smaller, the service has gotten worse, and the food quality has plummeted.  They removed some great dishes from the menu like the authentically Japanese Makunouchi box and replaced them with boring dishes like corn croquette. The new fish and chips they have is a joke, it's like Highliner fish sticks! The aburi sushi here never was as good as a place like Miku in downtown, but it was still tasty. But during the most recent visit, our aburi sushi was horrible! The slices of fish were cut so thin, I could only taste the rice. Even the rice block was so poorly constructed that it fell apart as soon as I lifted it up.  The service here has also gotten a lot worse. When they first opened, they were so friendly and very helpful when ordering. Now you can feel their impatience every time you pause while ordering. We ordered the stuffed chicken wing, which I've had numerous times. However, this time the meat was overcooked and the skin burnt. Given how long we waited for it, I didn't want to wait for them to cook it again, so we ate it even though the outer skin was bitter. I just mentioned in passing to the server that they had overcooked the chicken. I was expecting to hear an apology and that they would relay the feedback to the cook. However, this insolent server responds to me by saying since we already finished eating the dish and he hasn't seen it himself that he can't comment. After I showed him a picture of it, he responds by saying that's how they always cook it. I've never seen this server before, so I assume he's new. If a regular customer tells you that a dish that he's had numerous times before is overcooked, drop the arrogant ignorant attitude and just relay the info to the cook. I'm only trying to help...  As we were leaving, the greeter at the front mangled the Japanese so bad that it was quite entertaining. You have one job to welcome people when they arrive with \"irasshaimase\" and thank customers as they are leaving with \"arigatou gozaimashita,\" so the least you can do is try to pronounce it properly. That \"ariga gozamuuuuu\" was so far off, and the last part slurred so badly that it was obvious that he couldn't care less what verbal diarrhea was spewing out of his mouth. Not a big deal in itself, but it shows that some of the employees here just don't care and don't take much pride in doing their job well. Likely won't be back for a long time, if ever. Such a shame as I used to really like this place!"}
{"text":"We've been to Kiu a few times before and didn't have the experience we had tonight. The receptionist had to ask us several times how many people were in our party. We had a simple \"6\" answer to her question each time. \"No\" we didn't have a reservation but we were early and the restaurant wasn't even at half capacity.   Our server took our order and gave some suggestions which we considered but decided on something else. We tried the black and white sesame Ramen which were both tasty but found that the noodle portions were quite a bit smaller than Sansotei's. One bowl of noodles had a clump of undercooked noodles which we thought was not satisfactory.   The chicken wing dumpling was something new that we decided to order and it just wasn't what we expected for $3.50 a piece.  It was a wing with the middle part stuffed with what was supposed to be Wagyu beef, but it could've been any kind of minced beef.  It really wasn't very pleasing to the taste buds.  We often get the miso cod and everywhere we go it's usually nicely caramelized.  This one came out very blanche having us question whether it was cooked or not.  It was white so we knew it would be cooked, but it didn't look appetizing.  The taste did make up for its looks though.  Aburi sushi was good as always.  This time around we ordered the black sesame cheesecake.  Kiu attempts to make their presentation like a higher end restaurant but then they serve a slice with a piece missing from the tip.  It honestly looked like someone had taken a bite out of it.  We commented and a server was there.  He acted like he didn't know what we were talking about and we had call him back and show him.  Most restaurants, if they see more than one person at the table will bring or at least offer to bring a few forks for sharing the dessert.  We had to ask twice for the extra forks.  Following our comments regarding service then...  The food score would probably be a 4-star rating but the service is what brings it down to a 3.  First the receptionist, then the people who brought the food out.  It seems like none of the servers have been trained properly.  At a longer rectangular table, you would think that as food came, you'd spread it out quite a bit so that everyone could get access to the shared plates.  No.  All the food came out at one side.  When our side of the table was full, the servers just stood there (at the same end) not knowing what to do.  We had to move plates out of the way (down the table) so that they could set the food down.  There was plenty of space at either ends of the table too!  If you see kids you would think that common sense would tell you to not put hot soupy noodles directly in front of them where they could grab/spill/flip over the bowl.  Another guy poured hot tea and set the cup right in front of our baby too!  I quickly saw that and moved it out of the way before he could grab it.  He did apologize and said he wouldn't do it again.  I guess you have to experience a kid spill something before knowing not to place anything you don't want them to grab in front of them.    Overall, food was good but the service was frustrating."}
{"text":"Kiu restaurant was born from the Ishin Ramen restauramt and another manager.. This review is based mainly on their Ramen and its Stuffed Chicken Wings.  The Ramen (rosted garlic shoju) was good, the taste is light and flavourful, that broth is cook to perfection, a very well done ramen broth. For the rest of the items unfortunately it was not that good in my opinion. The noodles were too thin, that was what I got, i didn't get the option to choose thick noodles, i believe that's all what they got. The problem with thin noodles is the lack of texture and you can finish them with 3 to 5 spoons, no time to enjoy it. Continuing with the rest of the items.. Only half the egg, and the most disappointed cut of pork, only 2 slices and they were thin.. Not like a paper thin, that would had been too exaggerated, it was like 2 pieces of papers together thin and as mentioned, the thiner the less flavour you get and less texture as well... Yea that was bad.  On the other hand, we also ordered their Tsukemen, last time i tried this in Osaka which is pretty much the mother of Tsukemen.. This version at Kiu, was really good, pretty close to the one i had had in Japan; Thik noodles, flavourful broth, the pork was not as thin as the Ramen... This dish is $5 more than their normal ramen bowl, so i was expecting a bit more of quality, and it was delivered... In fact, this is the reason this review has 3 stars instead of 1.  At last, we got the Stuffed Chicken Wings, this is my favourite izakaya dish, but not in here. To start, the price, $7 and it came 2 pieces (which i didn't notice on the menu), for $7 you can get at least 3 -max 4- stuffed wings at any Izakaya, so value wise wasn't that fair. Moving on the taste, when we got the only 2 pieces i elevated my expectations with the flavour; as you know, quality and quantity. I expected a lot for my first bite and it didn't cut it. It was not that flavourful and it didn't have anything special on it.. I felt that they just put salt pepper deep fry and done... Don't order this, you can make 5 of them at home for $7.  In conclusion, the restaurant is good to go for a date, their sushi menu is quite expensive tho, so be careful with your date. But the best value could be having their Ramen for $11 you can be satisfied with a simple meal, so is not a bad place to dine/lunch specialy if you are waiting for your show at the theatre.  Oh!, their staff is great, very helpful and well trained... Koodos on those guys"}
{"text":"Kiu is an elegant upscale Japanese restaurant located in the same building as the Markham VIP cinemas. Hubby and I were able to walk in for lunch on a Sunday but I understand reservations are recommended for most other times. It was cool to see Chef Koji Zenimaru ( formerly of Kingyo Vancouver and now of Kingyo Toronto fame) was present to oversee the food preparation.   Hubby and I ordered the Isshin Red Miso Ramen ($14) and the Black Cod lunch ($20) to share. The black cod portion is fairly small. The meal came with a radish purée, a small mixed salad, miso soup, and steamed rice. Despite the smaller portion, the cod was perfectly grilled and delicious. The red miso broth was richly flavoured, and I loved how the thick wavy noodles were satisfyingly chewy. Char siu slices are on the thinner side but at least they were not fatty! We also tried the sakura mochi dessert which was also very elegant in presentation and had the chewy texture expected with mochi.  Jason our server was extremely attentive and had lots of fun facts to share. He took the time to go over the menu selections and came back frequently to check on us.  Definitely recommend trying Kiu if you're looking to have a nicer lunch or dinner out as all menu items are a la carte and the prices are steeper than your typical Japanese restaurant. 3.75 stars based on ambience, food taste and quality, and value for what you pay.  (57/100)"}
{"text":"I got the garlic ramen and it was okay. Soup was hot but the ramen was a little cooler so it threw me off. The soup and ramen should be similar temperature.  Garlic soup base is expected to be oily but this one really overdid it in my opinion. However, the toppings were great! This was the best egg I've ever had for ramen and I would come back just for the egg. It was seasoned well, but not overdone, and viscosity was just right so that you bit into it and there were still strings of egg you had to slurp.  Service was par for Asian places but I don't usually incorporate it in my ratings.  Overall, I would come again. $11 for a ramen is nice, and I like that you could add a couple dollars for a side dish. Their takoyaki was definitely great!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. I can't comment about the price because someone treated me :) overall ambiance is great. Convenient located in downtown Markham beside Cineplex. Service is very good. The only drawback is the closing hour. They close fairly early. I visited this establishment on Monday and they close at 10."}
{"text":"I only had the ramen here although I regretted not ordering the pressed sushi as I spent the entire meal staring at the table across from us. There are so many interesting things on the menu - I'll be sure to come back. The ramen itself was delicious. I had the garlic shoyu ramen which was delicious. The noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth was lovely. The service was a bit slow and the meal for our table did not all come out at the same time. I would however be willing to give it another chance as these things can happen."}
{"text":"Expected better service from previous reviews but could have been an off night. The good: Shrimp ebi sushi, stuffed chicken wings and Roasted garlic situ ramen. The bad: Snow crab croquette and a soft mushy texture, Pressed sushi salmon had way too much rice. Would come back to try more of the menu. Overall a very good quality restaurant in Markham."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday evening and was impressed enough with Kiu to recommend trying. Although I didn't order too much, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the ramen and the pressed sushi here and would gladly return.   Do note that some of the prices have changed since opening. All the sushi prices seem to have fallen around $5. I yelped this place beforehand and saw the 8 pieces of pressed sushi was $20 when I paid $15 for it. The same with the nigiri, aburi, and sashimi. This was much much more reasonable. Not sure about the izakaya items since I didn't order them, but the ramen prices were the same. The prices are steeper than most places but I think it's justifiable as the food here is great. I'm glad Kiu adjusted the prices in response to customer feedback.   When I heard they use ramen from ramen isshin, I just had to try their ramen and went with the Assari light shoyu ramen. The noodles were great but the broth was still to heavy and creamy, despite being 'light'. I still found the broth to be too heavy but that's just my low-sodium taste buds speaking. I wish there were more toppings included but it seems you would have to pay for them. My ramen only came with bamboo, half an egg, and some pork belly. It was pretty skimpy. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen and I would put it near Sansotei.   I also really enjoyed the pressed sushi and found the salmon and Angus beef one to be my favourites The server explained what each of them were which was nice. The rice was great, albeit a bit too brittle. The  sushi was melt in your mouth and didn't require any soy sauce.   The restaurant was super polished, service was good, and our waitress was really attentive but was too much at times. And as you go out, you're bombarded with goodbyes! Thank you, I will return!"}
{"text":"Most of their dishes were very nice.  The tempura and lamb chops are total misses.  Tempura shrimp batter was one of the worst i've ever experienced.  Lamb chops are also an item to avoid, as I am sure they've used some sort of tenderizer on them.  Other than that, the food overall is pretty good, particularly the chowamushi.  I've tried pretty much their entire menu, save for some ramen combos.,  Nothing outstanding, but they do enough things well enough to keep me coming back.  The service was top notch....it's not pretentious, they're not in your face, but they are attentive and always around.  Price is pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night for a table of 3 with no reservations, we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. They said it was full but it didn't seem packed and there was no one else in line.   The pork belly appetizer was good came out warm, the glaze was salty and sweet and the pea puree tasted really green and bright. The presentation was also nicer than expected. For $9 you only get 3 pieces so its quite an expensive bite. The pressed sushi was also good we got the salmon 3 way. It was good but not memorable wish there was slightly more of the smokey torched flavour but was still good  I like that a few of their ramen comes in 2 sizes, small and regular. I got a small and shared an app and 2 pressed sushi plates and I was ok, not really filling but good enough. The isshin noodles were delicious, chewy and a rich salty broth and the fun part is you get to ground your own sesame seeds to put in. It had the salty satisfyingness that you want from ramen. And for $8.50 for the small you get a soft boiled egg and pork with it, so the price isnt bad!  The decor is lovely, the booth seating is spacious. The service was hit or miss. There were a few younger servers who seemed lost, clueless, slow without any expression what so ever, while a few others were much better. The food came out a bit on the slow side though. The price is higher than other things in the area but comparable to other nicer izayaka places. For almost $30 I left not completely full but not hungry either, but would still come back for the ramen."}
{"text":"Spicy shio ramen, shio ramen and some beef ramen recommended by our server...   Four of us voted on the stars. Four stars plus.   At par with Ajisen Ramen though this ones a bit pricier at $13. Not bad"}
{"text":"Came here for just ramen and fried chicken set. We had Tokyo light shoyu and shio ramen. The light was flavorful but abit on the salty side, ironic. The shio seemed to be the best balance. The chicken or kara age was good. One drink the non alcoholic sherry temple was tasty.   Hmm this is a tough one since my favourite ramen is Kintaro in Vancouver which I use as a bench mark. This place comes close in some area.  Nice service!  I'm yet to try rice dishes."}
{"text":"I came here twice. Both time were amazing! Something recommended to order is the beef tongue stone cooking. I enjoyed the simplicity of the stone cooking. Our server could have been more attentive in refilling our drinks, however overall service was not bad. If you like torched sushi and oyster this is a great place to try. They have an oyster special for those who loves oysters. Drinks are amazing here."}
{"text":"Food quality is pretty good in Markham area. When I crave for sushi, sashimi or ramen, would think of going to Kiu restaurant.  Good location next to Cineplex VIP Markham.  Customer service is very good."}
{"text":"Kiu is a new Japanese izakaya place right in the heart of downtown Markham.  I came here with 4 other friends on a Saturday night after a great raptors win but the experience was disappointing.  Before I get to the food reviews, I want to warn everyone that the seating here is very limited, despite looking huge from the outside, the bar, kitchen area and sushi bar took a lot of available seating spaces, but the decors is very nice here.  Food, well I have to say many dishes were disappointing, but let's talk about the decent ones first:  Ramen is delicious here and the price is somewhat reasonable.  We ordered the Red Dragon Ramen ($16) and the Roasted Garlic Ramen ($11).  The ramen in both had very good texture and chewy (a must for me!) and the amount of ingredients in these ramens are great.  If you love eating spicy food, you will like the aftertaste spiciness from the Red Dragon Ramen.  Kiu Beef tataki ($12) was another dish I wanted to highlight, it didn't look too appealing when it was put down, but after trying one, the sauce and garlic chip on the beef were a killer combination!  The Pressed Sushi ($20) and the Daily Sashimi Platter ($50) were terrible.  Pressed Sushi is probably the worst I ever had, and it's not even comparable to Miku and Jabistro!  If you are charging such a premium price, I expect quality somewhat close to Miku or Jabistro standards.  The searing fish didn't have enough oil, sushi was small and the fish was tasteless.  But the worst of the worst is the Daily Sashimi Platter, for $50 you have around 25 pieces of average quality fish you eat at AYCE, all i saw were regular Tuna, octopus, red snapper, mackerel and fried fish skin?  Sashimi didn't taste fresh and some were cut very thin and weirdly (like the octopus).  If you are going to Kiu, stick with the ramen, appetizers and sake, but stay away from anything from the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Update: after coming here multiple times. Service has definitely gone down since they first opened. They don't check up on you mid meal anymore, ask you if you need help with the menu or make any recommendations. It's hard to flag down a waiter to make your order.   Remember to check your bill when paying. Was overcharge and when I told the waiter. She came back with the wrong amount again. It's not that hard to get it right there first time, especially when someone else in my party ordered the same thing and didn't get overcharged on their bill.   Prices has gone up since minimum wage increase.   --------------- My favourite nicer high-end japanese food in markham. Everything is cooked and made to perfection. Good for special occasions. Simple things like chicken wings and fish&chips tastes so good! They are not your standard wings and chips!   Underground parking is good for those cold days and rainy nights.   Service can be hit or miss. But they are usually good about filling your water"}
{"text":"Great service! Just pricey but oh so tasty. This is what you get when dining at these higher end Japanese cuisine restaurants. Located on the second floor of where the Markham VIP Cineplex theatres are. Surprisingly busy even on a Tuesday evening!"}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and taste good. Very nice elegant decoration for throughout the restaurant. However food is pricey but it's very typical for a non all you can eat restaurant. I didn't order ramen today, but I saw the ramen from people beside the table which has good portion and looks delicious. I will definitely go back for the ramen. The restaurant is in a prime location and beside the cineplex theatre which is a good place to spend time before or after your movie. This restaurant can only get more popular, I would recommend you to make a reservation because it does get busy and will get more busy as it's a new famous spot for the Chinese community."}
{"text":"$18 Chirashi (1/5): I'm a big fan of Chirashi, I often order it at Japanese restaurants. However, the Chirashi here was very disappointing. First of all, the portion size was tiny, there were no \"Sashimi\" sized fish that is normally served. All I got was scraps of fish in tiny pieces that is likely made from leftovers that cant be used for anything else.  If you have a nice fish, you can cut it into large pieces and it shows the quality and freshness. Similar to a good cut of steak, what I got was ground meat.  Also, ordered the Aburi, never came....  Their tip guide printed on the receipt is based off the total price: (cost+tax) x tip%. This causes you to overtip!  The proper tip should be calculated based on cost only  (cost)+(cost x tip%)+tax"}
{"text":"Went there twice..Once for dinner and once for lunch.  Reservations not mandatory but highly recommend it. This has become my new & favourite place to go to. Service and staff were excellent when I decided to treat my friend for lunch. Once entering the restaurant, be ready to get greeted non stop. We ordered the Red Miso Ramen and the Chirashi to share. The ramen was surprisingly not very spicy but it was also not salty at all. The broth was flavorful and rich. The noodles were at the right chewiness level and the portion was very filling and big..so delish that I wanna eat again now. Our other dish the Chirashi was an very interesting colourful display of fishes cut into small pieces and the fishes were so fresh!  Again, size wise, it wasn't small! It was my friend's bday so I had wanted to treat her for dessert too but too bad, no dessert for lunch that sat. Our waitress really tried to get us desserts though but alas, it was not meant to be.  I also came for dinner one time..it was a very last minute outing. got there and waited for about 15 mins for a table of two... There were no more tables for two  so they gave us a table for four. We ordered just three items. Two apps and the pressed sushi.   Their Stuffed Chicken wing with Wagyu beef was one of the most unique dish that I have ever tasted. Not overcooked and simply easy to eat,  the combination of the wing with the beef was a success. The Scallop croquettes were yummy but it was nothing special and at $16, not sure if I would want to order that, with only two pieces being served. The pressed sushi was near perfection and didn't needed any wasabi nor soy sauce. However, not sure if it was me, but I had difficulty picking up the sushi as the rice was falling.. might you, it was very difficult to grab the sushi with the Mackerel.    Cant wait to try their omakase and more items from their regular menu!"}
{"text":"A little disappointing this time I visited. Surprised at the vacancy and tables available on a Friday evening. Each time i went in the past, it was packed. I wondered why and finally figured out!   I ordered the 15 piece sashimi. When it arrived, i thought the presentation was top notch. However, when I looked at the toro and maguro, i knew the quality has changed. Once i put it in my mouth, the fish was not properly prepared. The sashimi contained a lot of tendon, poor quality and not acceptable.  A true Japanese sashimi chef would not have accepted amd present it to customers.  I will not recommend."}
{"text":"Dt Markham????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d?????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my partner.  Over priced, small portions, mediocre food and slow.  Servers are slow and don't pay much attention to you. As it is new, I would hope that these are just growing pains, but I was left seriously underwhelmed.   The decor is decent and fairly modern however as it's a new place I would expect it not to look like a dump. Doesn't cover the fact that the food and service experience still suck.  We went on a Friday night long weekend. Lots of empty tables and there were people waiting to get in. It makes me think they are trying to generate hype.   We ordered the lamb chops, beef tatami, appetizer box and black cod. It took more than an hour to arrive and we had to order a Ramen because we both felt like we hadn't eaten a thing. Bill came out to over $100  I will not be coming back. For the price and what you get it isn't good value. I can go somewhere else and be full for cheaper with much faster service."}
{"text":"A Hot and  business that opened up last month. Kiu us an authentic Japanese restaurant that's located in the same building Good Life Fitness and Cineplex.  Upon walking in, the ambiance is chic and contemporary with lots of Japanese inspired decor.  Prior to our movie, we both decided to check this place out...  Instead of food (which we had earlier somewhere else) we decided to have a drink.  Something new to me....Japanese plum wine, which I found out is a dessert wine that's served on the rocks. Definitely an enjoyable experience, however it's hard to not comment on their food they were serving up.  A second trip is definitely needed to get a better sense of the food."}
{"text":"Came here last night. With Kiu being Ramen Isshin's sister restaurant, I had high hopes for their ramen, since Ramen Isshin is my favourite Toronto ramen spot. Unfortunately, my Spicy Red Miso Ramen was not spicy at all, and the pork was quite rubbery and chewy. We also got the Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen, which tasted alright. The best was our appetizer: dumpling stuffed chicken wing. Boy that was delicious! Service-wise, this place is top-notch. Really attentive service and polite staff. Will I be back? Perhaps - if I have a Ramen Isshin craving, and  too lazy too drive downtown, I will give them a try again."}
{"text":"Was recommended by my friend to try this place out. So we came here just for food,  no movies... Lol....   Inside Cineplex Markham VIP, plenty of parking, no issues.  This place was on the second floor, across from Good life fitness.   This is quite a big restaurant in terms of tables and size, we walked in, was greeted in Japanese. Waited a few mins for a table, we got the tall tables as the booths were all out..   Ordered kaarage, ramen noodles as recommended by my friend..nothing was exceptionally delicious that I can't forget. Their sushi bar was contemporary and looked posh.... I felt like they did ditch in alot of money to renovate but stepped back in quality in food. Service was an a-ok, we were checked upon 3 times during out 1 hr ish dinner...water was refilled...  The  prices are $$$, in my personal opinion, they have omakase but it's priced higher than Kaji  which kinda blew me away....   All in all,  a place that I may come back but not in a hurry..."}
{"text":"Firstly, Location is perfect. Right in downtown Markham. But with that price, the food are really so so. They try hard to copy the fusion fancy Japanese restaurant like Jabistro in downtown. They are lack of creativity for the food. It needs more progress and improvement. There are still gaps."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night, we were immediately seated and the server came to the table pretty quickly to assist us. It was towards the end of the night and we were not rushed; the server let us take our time ordering. We ate the Chicken Karaage, 8 piece Aburi Oshi Sushi, Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen and Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen. All items tasted pretty good. I would come back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! The location is very central in downtown Markham, and on the second floor of the building, the glass windows yield a nice view.  I ordered the small Spicy White Sesame Shio Ramen and the portion was very filling - although I had a small appetite that day. No complaints about the food, however, there was nothing amazing about it. I found it pleasant, not too spicy, and very flavourful.   The service was pretty good and we recevied our meals quickly. I'd love to come back here to try more of their ramen!"}
{"text":"Located in uptown markham, upstairs in the cineplex building. It's clean, nice place for a date, business meeting or casual lunch.   The pressed sushi was just okay, a bit disappointing. I probably wouldn't order it again.   Karage was great, I didn't expect less.  Salmon carpaccio was delicious, probably the most stand out dish that I ordered. The Ramen was also delicious. I ordered the white miso something, sorry can't remember lol but it was unique and flavourful.   I'd probably come back for the atmosphere, convenience and Ramen.  Oh and can't forget service. Top notch!"}
{"text":"High end sushi fusion restaurant. Internal decor was very modern, dimly lit, slightly loud r&b/SoundCloud music in the background...you get the idea. Came here with a group of 7 with reservations. I didn't appreciate that our waitress didn't serve us drinks immediately after we seated - but only asked us maybe 20mins after seating and really pushed for \"any drinks?\". We just ordered water.   Torched sushi was great although, I've had better. I ordered the spicy white sesame ramen. Definitely hearty with a good amount of spice for all you spice lovers! I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, espexially for their 1/2 price oysters, however it is on the pricier side!"}
{"text":"Always been a great fan of this place.  Once of the better if not best places to have ramen here.  It has come to a point that I think I am hoping to get a VIP card for going there so often haha.  On a serious note, I come here on average at least a minimum of once per month and have to say, food is usually pretty stellar and service is great.  There are times that when it does get too busy, you might get sub-par service, but hey, unless you are going to a fancy restaurant where an entree costs close to a minimum of $50, what else would you expect?  I have tried a lot of things, but the guys and I usually get excited for the special menu that Kiu usually brings out on a consistent basis.  A lot of different varieties of appetizers such as corn tempura (Called something a lot fancier) and other things that are truly salivating and delicious.  I usually go for the Garlic Shoyu as that is my go to ramen dish as well as the Karage here is just delicious.   Las time we came here, we tried the skewers and while the price of the dish is relatively high, and might not be fully worth the price tag, it is good none the less.  If you do go for the skewer, do go for the pork belly as that seems to be my friend's favorite.    PS. DO NOT GO FOR THE SQUID LEGS (My friend almost died from the minimalist amount of the dish.....I mean he literally died cause it was 6 dollars for 3 pieces of squid legs the size of two to three toothpicks put together.)"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, very clean, exceptional quality ingredient flow in from Japan weekly.  What else can I said, just worth my time to enjoy an authentic Japanese diner"}
{"text":"Came early for dinner with a friend on Mother's Day. Was accommodated at the ramen bar which is fine with us. The countertop is surprisingly spacious.  The menu consisted a mix of izakaya items, ramen and sushi. We ordered a few from izakaya section and the assorted pressed sushi (8pcs).  The cooked foods were all excellent - they also happened to be mostly deep fried stuff. The dumpling stuffed chicken wings was really good! Juicy and well marinated. My next favorite are the snow crab croquettes.  I think the chicken karaage can be skipped, nothing special.  The assorted aburi-style pressed sushi seem like a decent deal $20 for 8 pcs - we had a beef tataki, salmon, unagi and one other white fish I forgot. I was disappointed with it - too much rice and it didn't have the \"melt in mouth\" feel that aburi sushi should have.  Will come back to try their ramen one day. Good atmosphere and really attentive service!"}
{"text":":O Surprised at the ratings so far - I like this restaurant!  I visited Kiu a couple of times for dinner. I give +stars for its environment because it is very clean and spacious. I also like how there's a lot of windows, lots of light!   It said on the menu that the chef choice sashimi platter is imported from Tsukiji Market. (One of my fav sashimi go-to places in Japan!)  MANKUNOUCHI BOX (4/5) Loved all the items in the bento box, minus one item, which was the tuna fish guts. It looked slimy and gooey and we didn't want to try it but I did anyways. Its flavour tasted like it was marinated in Korean-style spicy sauce / wasabi sauce and the texture was raw octopus-like, very chewy. I wouldn't eat it again hahaha  The fish roe was delicious :) Also, the saba!  STUFFED CHICKEN WING DUMPLING (4/5) [deep fried chicken wings stuffed with minced wagyu beef, pork, shiso, water chestnuts, cabbage & chives] This is always my go-to dish in Japanese izakayas. Loved it! I order this each time I visit Kiu. If there was more sauce that goes with it, it would make it a lot better!  PRESSED SUSHI (3/5) [12 pc of 4 kinds of sushi / 3pc each] I liked the torched salmon pressed sushi the most. There was beef, mackerel... etc. It would've been better if the pressed sushi could be held up by chopsticks, it kept falling apart :(   BLACK COD FISH (5/5) Nothing can go wrong with cod fish. Love ittt  TAKOYAKI (3/5) Nothing special, would've liked it more if they added more sauce on top.  KARAAGE (3.5/5) The chicken wasn't dry - it was nice, crispy and hot :)  RAMEN Overall, the ramen sets weren't that good. I'd recommend the sushi/sashimi here instead.  WHITE SESAME SHIO RAMEN (3/5) The neat part about this ramen is that it comes a cute wooden tool that you can grind the sesame seeds with.   ASSARI LIGHT SHOYU RAMEN (2.5/5) It lives up to what it's supposed to be, a very light broth - but the broth was too light, which made it not have much taste. (I didn't order this haha)  ROASTED GARLIC SHOYU RAMEN (3.5/5) The most flavourful out of all the ramen sets I've tried. I'd recommend this out of the three."}
{"text":"It's a slightly higher end Japanese Place. But wanted to dine here for my bday.   Was craving oysters so got the 1/2 dozen!  So fresh and delicious!   Also ordered:   Makunouchi Box (8 Chef Sample Appetizers served in a Bento Box) The presentation was nice, every serving had its own little dish. My fave was a pickled radish with tako pieces and a wasabi kind of sauce. The Beef Tataki was also good.   Stuffed Chicken Wing Dumpling (Deep Fried Chicken Wing Stuffed with Wagyu Beef, Pork, Shiso, Water Chestnuts, Cabbage & Chives. Tossed in Sweet Soy Sauce & Covered with In House Spice) Fried to perfection and taste was not bad.   Kiu Speciality Lobster Roll (Lobster, Cucumber, Tuna, Torched Kiu Coriander Sauce & Ikura) Presentation again was really nice. I liked the Big Roe Eggs on top, they were not salty nor fishy. The alfalfa sprouts were also a nice touch. But I didn't really taste much lobster.   Aburi Sushi( 4 Pcs Nigiri & 3 Pressed Sushi) We should've ordered a larger one, but I was getting full already. We ended up sharing half pieces of each lol. But regardless it was still very good. My fave was the pressed sushi with thin slice of tako and torched coriander sauce.  We basically just sampled. Will come back again to try other Items."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend on Valentine's day? we placed our reservation very early, but when we get there, they gave us seat with very terrible spot, ( right beside the kitchen). Even the walk-ins have better seat than us! We asked to change our seat but the host said she cannot do anything about the situation. This is the first time I came to this restaurant with my girlfriend, and the bad performance of the host really ruined our mood on Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"Another visit to Kiu for dinner! I tried some of the new items on their menu and they did not disappoint.  I ordered the sea eel (anago) pressed sushi and the scallop and salmon roe pressed sushi! The flavours were amazing - the anago had yuzu and sansho pepper which pair extremely well. Only downside was that there was a lot more rice to fish than I would have preferred.   The yuzu and lemongrass cocktail I had was divine, and the bartender was very kind. Definitely will return again!"}
{"text":"Kiu is still in it's soft opening phase so there is definitely a good chance for more surprises in the future but here is my experience from today's visit:  First off, the location is perfect. Set in the heart of the developing Downtown Markham, Kiu is located on the second floor in the Cineplex Markham VIP building. While the view may not be gorgeous, the decor certainly is. A modern open concept vibe and a gorgeous bar and sushi bar giving off that high end feel.   The staff are friendly and ready to help. Throughout our visit, they consistently offer to refill our tea, answer any and all questions and the chefs are just as friendly while they are preparing the food. This restaurant boasts an assortment of cooked small dishes as well as pre-set sushi and sashimi sets (but the prices are quite steep for the quantity/quality in my opinion).  We ordered the assorted pressed sushi ($20), Tuna Carpaccio, bone marrow and the dessert (3 rice cakes/dango). Overall, the food was pretty good (I know there are mixed reviews on this). I feel that the carpaccio we had was a bit too bland. The sushi was good in my opinion - nothing disappointing or outstanding. The dessert was brilliantly plated and I don't know what I was expecting from a $9 dessert (knowing it was dango) but I was pretty satisfied (though may have preferred a slightly larger size in terms of dangos). The miso bone marrow is sweet...so while it was cooked to perfection and presented nicely, I would have preferred a more savoury flavor.   I will definitely be coming back to check out the omakase menu and keep in mind everyone, this is still their soft opening phase. I'm looking forward to seeing if there are any changes later on."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Menu looked pricey so decided to skip the sushi and go for the deep fried octopus n spicy ramen noodles. Octopus was mixed with what tasted like mashed potatoes but still very delicious. Ramen noodles were cooked just right with a good chew to them and the right amount of spice. Finished my meal with the Matcha tiramisù. Honestly was not very impressed as it was probably not even more then 4 ounces and it claimed to be the creation of Markham Master Chef. @ $9 I've had better. Tiramisù tasted like cream cheese mixed with matcha powder and contained pieces of sponge cake with cookie crumbs on the bottom."}
{"text":"FOOD: I had the vegetarian ramen for the first time ever and it was really delicious! Chose the flavours really well that it blends perfectly. The plating was really good too. Limited vegetarian options though.   PLACE: Classy looking place, organized and neat. Washrooms were super clean and seats were comfortable.   PRICE: $$ decent for what you order  SERVICE: Great service but not so nice receptionist. Waiters were helpful and took care of us well but The lady that took us to our seats (receptionist), asked first if we had reservations which we did not. She then checked her computer and said sure come on in and when she took us (my friend and I) to our seats she asked \"you'll be done within an hour right?\" The place was NOT busy, there were plenty of seats, and I thought it was very rude of her to mention that. I have other friends who went to this place who said she said the same thing to them. Not cool at all! I felt like I had to rush eating just to get out of there within an hour..."}
{"text":"The best service and hostess I've ever had , one of the reasons why I always come back.She was so friendly and accommodating even tho it was Valentine's Day , I understand it can get busy . I recommend the ramen , sushi is not my favourite but it's more of a personal preference ."}
{"text":"I walked in and got a nice greeting. Inside was a very roomy restaurant. But we were sit in a small table and a tight area between 2 table which is 1 foot away from both table. I request a different table but they didn't have it. But there was 2 table open on the other side of the restaurant. We opened the menu and it was very limited selection. So small selection we decided to leave. The tea came and we didn't even touch it and the waitress ask for $3.15. Lol screw it , here is $5 bucks. Good night!"}
{"text":"Well. I had hoped to review this place. We noticed it as we walked to the car park elevator after a movie. The time was 8:25. This is important.   The restaurant was almost empty, plus we weren't entirely sure we wanted to eat there so before sitting down we asked to see a menu. We spent five minutes at most looking over it before asking about the omakase menu. This, the hostess informed us, was available at 6:30 and 8:30. I looked at my watch. Exactly 8:30. We're in luck! Let's do that. Not so fast she informed us. You have to place the order at least 10 minutes before the sitting, i.e. at 8:20. Can you at least ask the chefs? She went over and asked them. Sorry. No.   We left. It was 8:32. What exactly had happened in ten minutes that the chefs were no longer to prepare the food? 8:20 - everything's fine please take a seat. 8:30 - not a chance.   Will we return? Maybe. Not for a while though."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is good for a night out with a variety of food, however the quality is hit or miss. Good service.   The GOOD: - Stuffed Chicken Wing Dumpling - surprisingly delicious, the best item I had (A dumpling inside a chicken wing - I think I had something similar at Hanmoto)  The MEH/OK:  - Salmon Carpaccio - nothing wow compared to other izakayas - Kyoto Milk Tofu - interesting creamy texture, doesn't taste like regular tofu, topped with lobster bits and quinoa  The BAD: - Pressed Sushi - The scallop is so thin, can't taste it at all. If you do get this, I would suggest the Ebi Prawn - this one was good with evident texture & flavor from the sauce. I guess I'm not having much luck with pressed sushi in GTA. - Tsukumen Dipping Ramen - the noodles are much too hard for my liking & didn't realize it's cold"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. Tried to order sake, but they didn't have any sake yet as this was their second day of operating... I hope they get some soon, because their sake menu looked pretty good.  My friends ordered the chirashi don, ramen, and I had a black cod lunch. All the food was pretty good. My friend said she would have the chirashi again, so it must be good. The ramen was cooked well, flavour was good, however we wished there was more meat in it. Black cod lunch was good (above average), not the best I've ever had, but it's better then most places. The piece of black cod also seemed small for the price you're paying.  They are still working on their wait service. There have been a few occasions during this meal that other tables food almost came to us, but we either declined it or our waiter steered them away last minute. It's not a huge deal seeing as it being their second day in operation, however it will likely get busier, so these little kinks need to be worked out sooner rather then later.  For now, I'd say Kui can be a 4 out of 5. But we will be going back to try other dishes and hopefully the service will be better at that time."}
{"text":"Tried Ramen Isshin before. That was quite disappointed. And went to Kiu today for Lunch. As they are same group I didn't expect too much from them.  I ordered Tenshin don and Takoyaki. To be honest Takoyaki was average, too solid. And Tenshin don was below average. No flavour in eggs. Too salty sauce and RICE! Wasn't well cooked.  Won't go back again. They seem to be over priced by innovation and location. The most important thing for a restaurant is Taste.  Last but not least. I ate $14 and gave a girl $20 bill. She asked me if I need my change. It really made me uncomfortable. More like she's noticing don't forget the tips. Please use  your common sense."}
{"text":"More like 3.5. Walking into Kiu actual caused so much anxiety. First of all the place looks like it's high end...you can smell the dollar signs on the floor mat. So as a broke ass studded with 17 in his bank I was about to faint. Couple with an awkward    \"Irasshaimase\"!!! It's weird cause they don't yell it with enthusiasm but as if they don't wanna say it. With 20 people bowing at me it feels wierd   The food can be very pricy on certain dishes. Others such as the $7 takoyaki and $11-15  ramen is not bad. But 2 baked oysters for 7 was like ugghhhhh.  However they were big enough to equal 4 regular sized oysters so it was okay.   First of takoyaki was perfect. Generous amount of bonito flakes with actual pieces of octopus. Not only one small ass poverty piece but 3 good sized ones. Oysters were blessed. Super creamy with a very fresh taste.   The ramen was not bad. The garlic shoyu had a super rich flavour while the red miso felt a bit oily and not even spicy. The chashu was super tender and literally melted in the mouth. The noodles were super bouncy and had a good chew.   Overall a really nice Izaykaya restaurant. However prepare for your wallet to be empty on the way out."}
{"text":"The only thing I would recommend to try is the ramen only in this restaurant. Other dishes like rice bowl the portion is too small and the quality of the ingredients in the rice bowl are poor. Even the takoyaki octopus was a bit overcooked. And there were only 4 units in it ( usually 6 in most of the restaurant with the same price). So everything is overpriced and portion is way too small.  The only dish I would recommend to try is ramen that's all. Don't waste money on other food."}
{"text":"Venue/Ambiance (4) Located on the second floor of the Cineplex building. Kiu is spacious and dimly lit, classy and intimate. Great for smaller groups and dates. Parking is limited despite the large lot and underground parking as it is shared with movie-goers and gym members.  Service (5) Quick and efficient. Very friendly waiter who took our orders and apologized for longer waits due to the dinner rush. Our server gave recommendations and was more than happy to explain several menu items. Only qualm was that the bill took quite a while to arrive.  Food (4.5) Raw fish items were fresh and served beautifully. Baked oysters were delicious. The wagyu stuffed wings were good but felt like a waste to use high quality meat in there since we couldn't taste the difference. The dipping ramen we ordered was much too salty for our taste, which is consistent with other reviews here. Dessert options were super limited. We didn't end up ordering any.   Quality/Value (4) Prices are higher than average in the area. I do acknowledge the atmosphere is nice and the service attentive. Presentation of menu items were done well.   Overall (4)  My first visit here was a pretty good experience. Would recommend for others to try, especially if they are already in the area for a movie."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to compliment how the server was very pleasant and nice to begin with. We came here for my fathers birthday and we enjoyed the ambience. It's trendy, young and fun.  But our server managed to get at least 3 items wrong for the party of 5 of us.  Two of which were minor but the last one we were just laughing \"wrong again?!?\"  She smiled \"sorry!\" It's hard to understand cos they used tablets to take order so how can one get it wrong it's a puzzle to us. And we thought it was kinda funny.  Other that that, I think we like the fact there are variety of food available on the menu, such as ramen, don (rice box), sushi/sashimi, small dishes as well.  Price is more on the expensive side for the quality-but the presentation makes up for it.  We were told that the owner is Japanese.  We ordered chirashi sushi (which is the raw fish rice), ramen, sashimi set etc, they were good, like 7.5 out of 10 I would say.  Over all experience 3.5 star."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and especially your money at this place. Overly priced for what you're getting. Very disappointed.  - Nice dishes/ presentation, but most of them didn't taste as good as it looks. - Stay away from the ramen noodles. Worst ever. Noodles weren't all done, broth was mediocre...in a nutshell, instant noodles would be better. No joke. - Specialty rolls weren't spectacular or even special. In a nice place like this, I would of expected a fantastic house roll which never happened. - Service...well, I can say that it was bad, but I can say that staff were very inexperienced. Almost looked like it was their first time working in a restaurant. Not too quick, and when dishes were ready, these were not the smart enough type to gage when and how many plates to bring to our faces.  *Since it was an izakaya type of place, we ended up ordering like 8-10 dishes for 4 people. Kitchen was fast to prep all of that, but by the time all the dishes came out and on our table, it felt exactly like a buffet style resto.  Anyways, just wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went before the movie last night and the restaurant was pack!  Make sure you make a reservation before you had over.  Luckily there was a high table available and we took the spot.  Tsukemen (dipping noodle) is always my favourite!  Lots of sake selection and want to try out their premium flight for $24 next time.  Don't forget to order the chicken karaage, prob one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"It was good!! The sushi was fresh, a bit on the expensive end. The tea was extra charge but unlimited refills, I personally thought it would have been better if they just left one tea pot on our table instead of asking them to refill it. However, great environment - ramen, oyster, sushi was all really well prepared."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The sashimi is over priced here and average quality like other ayce places so i would recommend trying their appetizers instead.  The ramen comes in small or regular size so you make save room in ur tummy to try more appz.   Highly recommend the snow crab chawan mush and the roasted garlic shoyu ramen. Love the broth. Both are extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"Recently tried out their lunch menu and everything was so good! We had the salmon carpaccio, ebi mayo, chicken karaage, ramen and chirashi don. You pay a bit of a premium but worth it."}
{"text":"Love the omakase! The sushi is fresh and compares favourably to Yasu, which is another sushi favorite."}
{"text":"Great food with great variety, and conveniently located next to the cinema. Spectacular bowls of ramen, great quality sushi and sashimi, delicious grilled dishes and fish and tasty desserts. Wonderful service and atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I was there with my gf around 7,I was lineup around an hour to got seat,the whole restaurant was busy. I ordered lots of food,like black cod,sushi set,ramen,signature maki etc..the black cod was so delicious,also the spicy ramen is my favorite.signature maki was amazing. The service was great. would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The TLDR version of my review is: this is a good Japanese place worth checking out, albeit rather pricey especially for what you're getting.  Up to you to pick and choose your experience here. You can easily get in and out for less than $20/person, but the bill can easily skyrocket much higher if you opt for a higher-end/fuller dining experience with sushi/sashimi and/or a number of appetizers and drinks to go with your meal.  The ramen, which is pretty good, apparently comes from the same folks who started up Ramen Isshin, one of my favourite ramen joints in the city. However, from what I recall from my last experience at Isshin, the original location is a bit better. No matter though, because I'm still pretty confident that the ramen here is among the best you can find in Markham. If you get a ramen and nothing else, you are looking at about $20 for your meal.  Add in some sides, appetizers, or drinks, and the bill quickly adds up. For example, we opted for a grilled cod ($18). It was good, cooked well, very tender, and melted in your mouth, but considering that it was $18 for a piece that was less than the size of your typical filet.. hmm... have to think twice about the value there, even if I know that the fish is really good quality.  Service was excellent and the decor is pretty good. I was greeted with a bit of a \"irashaimasse\" when walking in but nothing like your typical izakaya or ramen places downtown. This is more of a place for a bit of an occasion rather than a casual get-together dining spot. It could make for a decent spot to go before/after a movie if you are looking for an upgrade over the usual North American chains or fast food spots.   Note that if you are coming for dinner on a weekend night you should consider making reservations, especially on weekends that are busy with opening releases for popular movies. Even on average weekends, the main seating area is often fully reserved (but you might be able to walk in and get a table at the bar or one of the high tables if you're early enough). Certainly if you're bound by time to catch a movie the last thing you want to do is have to wait for a table. They also do takeout for their sushi at least, and I've seen some Japanese families pick up sushi from here, so that's gotta be a good sign?!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I would give it 4 stars but our waiter seemed to be in a hurry to gat us out of the table regardless there were plenty of empty tables at that moment. The food was yummy and very tasteful, my only suggestion will be to reduce the amount of mayonnaise in their sauces and rolls. The pork belly was 100% \"amazing\" The Garlic Ramen was good although a bit more meet will take it to the next level."}
{"text":"The Red Dragon Ramen here was probably the best ramen I ever had. It has a bad ass name and the combination of 15 spices makes the taste very unique.  I went to Kiu on a Saturday night and it was super busy especially since its located on the 2nd floor of the Markham Enterprise Theatre. Expect to wait unless you sit at the Ramen bar or are feeling lucky.  The Red Dragon I ordered was on the pricier side at $16 pre tax but it is totally worth it. I also think it is only available during dinner time since dragons dont appear all the time. The noodles were cooked well and not soggy at all. The ramen came with a red chili pepper and a stack of sauce. Once you mix the sauce, thats when the soup base lives up to its name and becomes red. The one downside of the ramen is that I didn't think it was spicy but it was delicious regardless.  The customer service for the ramen was very fast and I would definitely come again to try out their sushi and other ramen."}
{"text":"We were craving for ramen and decide to come here for dinner.  We ordered dipping ramen and the red dragon ramen.  The red dragon ramen came with hot Chile sauce.  If you can't take the heat, don't order this ramen.  I asked the server to put the Chile sauce on the side so I can put in based on my liking.   Thr dumpling ramen comes with pork bone broth.  It is very tasty and worth trying.  We also ordered some salmon torched sushi.   The sushi was alright but not impressed.  It taste very blend and no wow factor at all.  Overall ramen is good and I would skip the torched sushi next time."}
{"text":"This review is only on the restaurant's ramens.   Dined at this place twice for ramen since its conveniently located inside the theater and I really wanted to love this place as they serves Isshin Ramen here in Markham.  On my first visit, i ordered the  Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen (regular size).  It was too oily and salty for my liking.  So the second time around, I ordered the White Sesame Shio ramen (regular size) and specifically requested for less salt and oil. The soup base from the second time came out way better (ie less salty and oily) with the right amount of flavour.  The noodles are good. But nothing too memorable when compared to the other ramen places.   But one thing that's common in the both visits is that the portions are WAY TOO SMALL. They charge $11 (the cheapest option) for a regular ramen but the noodle portion is like a pack of instant noodle - maybe even lesser according to my boyfriend. We appreciate that they have good quality soup base but for the price we would expect the portions to be a little more.  My boyfriend actually left the restaurant hungry both times.  There's even a small size option that you can order, which I would imagine it to be more of a kid's size ramen?  Dont think we would come back in the future, unless we want to have a big dessert afterwards."}
{"text":"I finally tried the sushi here. Rating is still the same. I really want to like Kiu more! It's spacious and comfortable and service is accommodating with a nice view if you're lucky as it's on the second floor.  We ordered the chef's choice nigiri, chicken karaage, and torched sushi (six pieces). Total damage, about $60 (and we were not really full). For what it is, I feel it's overpriced - I would hope that for $60 for two people we would be full or the food to be amazing.  The chef's choice nigiri was good. Comes with more expensive things like scallop, uni.. I've had better uni but for the price point it's fair. $19 for 6 pieces, but it didn't wow me. But I think the sushi is still good here and not a bad choice.  The torched sushi was quite thin and dry, the rice fell apart and it was at a premium price too... I would say don't get this. I've had bad experiences with torched sushi and this was another one on the list - the only place so far that I think does it well so far is Torch at Yonge and Cummer.  The karaage though, strangely enough, was the dish that impressed me the most! Huge pieces of chicken, super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Best karaage I've had.  I think I will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty surprised how much I enjoyed this place. I came here with a friend who was in the process of moving away from the area, and I'm a little sorry that we didn't discover this place sooner. Between the both of us we ordered: the seared scallop salad, the assorted pressed sushi (8 pieces), okonomiyaki, takowasa (raw) and (off the \"specials\" menu) the corn karage and the garlic seafood soumen.  The takowasa came first, which was essentially raw octopus marinating in a wasabi-like sauce... and the wasabi was just SO overpowering, I couldn't enjoy more than a taste.  The okonomiyaki and seared scallop salad were good, though nothing spectacular.  The pressed sushi ( 4 types, 2 of each) I wish I knew what was in each one. There were two types with salmon, one with what I think was squid and one that was topped with avocado which, after being pressed, just became even creamier... ALL very tasty.   The corn karage (which was essentially corn kernels that were tempura battered and fried together to make a deep fried corn ball) was AMAZING and worth the ENTIRE dinner. Seriously, if it had arrived earlier in the meal, there's a chance I may have cancelled everything else and have ordered more. But then, I'm a sucker for corn.  The garlic seafood soumen (vermicelli pasta in a creamy, garlicky seafood broth full of seafood) took a LONG time to arrive (long enough for us to almost cancel if it didn't get there soon), but as it turns out, it was worth the wait. The broth was SO creamy (I can almost guarantee this was a FULL cream sauce) but you could also REALLY taste the seafood and the garlic, both subtle yet prominent. I was also surprised at the amount of seafood I got in it. I wish this meal had arrived sooner so that I could have eaten more of it. I hope they make this a regular menu item!"}
{"text":"We came back to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday with family.  We called to pre-order some rice bowls for the kids as they are not offered on the dinner menu and Kiu graciously accommodated our request.    Between the 6 adults and 3 kids, we shared fresh and cooked oysters (fresh ones were better as the grilled oysters were too rich), peeled asparagus salad (good), aburi sushi (good), nigiri sushi (also good), some a la carte sushi (uni-good, otoro-super good), roasted garlic shoyu ramen (garlic was too burned this time), white sesame original ramen (didn't get to try this one), stuffed chicken wings (had much better at Izakaya Ju) and lobster ceviche (not memorable).   They brought out all the raw orders first and the food was a hit and miss.  It was really the sequence or food brought out that was not ideal as some of the family members who don't eat raw fish had to wait a long time to receive anything they could eat.  But the servers were very accommodating when we asked them to bring out certain foods before other dishes (i.e, the rice bowls for the kids...etc).  Our overall experience was still pretty good but next time, I'll pre-order a menu so we don't have to waste a whole bunch of time ordering upon arrival and the confusion with food timing.    I'll continue to regard Kiu as one of the go-to sushi places when in Markham."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening for dinner. It wasn't too busy and we got a table as soon as we walked in. We ordered the beef tataki and it was delicious. The spicy snow crab maki was a little disappointing in terms of size and flavour. The chicken karaage was nothing spectacular, very similar to a Taiwanese style fried chicken bite. The lobster ceviche and scallops were plain.  The ramens were good, they were not as salty as most other ramen places. It was a little disappointing that there was no seafood ramen. The taro ice cream was delicious. They had several flavours but it stated on the menu that mixing the flavours was not an option. And none of the desserts are made in house, which is disappointing for a menu at this price point. Overall, everything tasted on the lighter side, which we don't mind but some people might think it's a little bland."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice and had a modern look touched with Japanese decor. Servers and greeters were nice.  I had ordered the Tsuke-men and it was full of oil and super salty which would have been fine if it was rich in a flavourful way... but it was just salty...  I generally love hanjuku tamago(soft boil egg) but this one was too salty as well!   In retrospect, I probably should have said something just to see if it was an accident or if it was how its suppose to be... Had to drink a lot of water after to hydrate myself..."}
{"text":"We ordered a Chirashi $18 and a Roasted Garlic Ramen $11.  For $18, the chirashi wasn't worth it given that they only give you small pieces of sashimi (seemed like leftover bits). I know every place does their chirashi differently, but for the price, the fish selection and portions really lacked!   The ramen at $11 is pretty standard. But the meat was so thinnly sliced, lacked a good bite. Oh, and there were only two slices. Two thin slices. Yup. Lots of noodles though! Soup is on the saltier side.  We also got a Shirley Temple for $4. Good stuff.  When our dishes were served, one guy took everything off the tray and put it in front of my boyfriend, while I was handed the whole tray. Inconsistency in service? Just thought that was weird. ONLY BECAUSE, the guy who brought me the ramen knocked my boyfriend's wasabi off his bowl onto the table. I guess he didn't notice since he didn't bring us a new lump.   I gave it an average rating given that our server was nice and the place was nice. But lunch overall was disappointing."}
{"text":"So this place is probably easier to check out during lunch time - since I don't need to wait an hour or so to get in.   There are a few things about this place that I like a lot. Like their friendly service and the fact that they have always been super helpful and proactive about addressing certain issues before I even realize there is an issue.  For example, they gave us some complimentary miso soup, because the ramen we had ordered was late in coming - I know it seems small in retrospect, however the fact is that I hadn't noticed that the kitchen was backed up and that food was taking longer than normal to arrive at my table. But it honestly is the gesture that counts and it does go a long way.  Another thing I love is the fact that they will coat check my stroller frame out of site from everyone and bring me the high chair for my little one. It makes it so much easier to manage at the time, because as most parents know it is NOT easy travelling around with a little one, especially with all the gear we have to bring along.   But I digres and back to the topic at hand, Kiu's food is good. I do find that their sushi is a bit more than I want to spend for lunch so their ramen is pretty much the only thing I order exclusively here with the exception of adding on either a couple of bites of their karaage or takoyaki for an extra few dollars. ( My advice - get the karaage) I find their other options are good - but a little pricey and not quite as filling.  I haven't tried the sushi yet - but maybe on a special occasion day I will."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants where if you've been there a couple times, you've probably tried everything you would have liked to try on the menu.  They have a number of good menu items which are unique when it comes to Japanese restaurants (pork belly, ribs, bone marrow, and several good desserts, etc.).  However, their selections of salads and rolls are somewhat lacking.  They only have 2 salads which are dry in their composition and dressing.  It would be nice if they had a salad with Japanese ginger dressing.  Currently they also only have 1 actual roll within their sushi menu.  We were told that the restaurant is working on an updated menu with greater roll selection, however.  Hope that happens along with an expanded salad menu.   Service is generally very good.  The waiter during our last visit was extremely attentive and brought and removed items very quickly.   Their ice cream policy is somewhat unreasonable.  They offer 3 flavours (Black Sesame (great!), Ginger, and a third flavour) and each order comes with 2 scoops, all the same price.  They don't allow customers to mix & match the flavours though which is silly."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst.  Staff: It was Halloween season and some of the staff were in costume. While I understand that it was perfect for the season, I would say that they should refrain from wearing masked costumes as it is difficult to hear them talk when ordering. Other than that, I would say their service was alright.  Ambience: It is very loud and the tables are quite close to each other. Again, it was alright.  Food: I ordered the Snow Crab Croquettes and an Assari Light Shoyu Ramen. The Croquettes were pretty good, they reminded me of crab cakes more though, rather than some of the melt in your mouth croquettes I've had before. The ramen wasn't that special but filling.  It was not bad but I don't know if I'd come back any time soon."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday specifically for the $1 oyster's special after seeing it on their IG. Unfortunately after arriving we saw at the front that there was actually a limit BEFORE 8:30 pm. For every 2 customers the limit is a dozen.. I felt like it was false advertisement. No where in their post does it mention anything about a limit prior to 8:30. Had they put that in then I would've planned to go after 8:30.. because let's be honest.. is a dozen of oysters for 2 people ever enough?  They should let people know there's a limit before a certain time.   But we decided to sit down and eat there anyway.   Our hostess was very nice and sat us down but then another girl(she seemed and dressed like she's a manager as all the other servers were wearing black, she was wearing a grey blazer) came up to our table and said \"want drinks??\" We had literally just sat down and did not even get the drink menu yet.. we told her water for now. She came back with the water and asked for our order (again in a very rushed tone) and we said we need a few more minutes. A male sever took our order, I asked him about the oysters and which one was preferred by others as I don't often have oysters and no nothing about it. He just said \"everything just gets half and half.\" He didn't even mention what the half and half are.. maybe I'm stupid and I should just automatically understand what he meant?   Needless to say the rest of the service we received from this restaurant was not great. When we got our oysters, I asked the server (the one who looked like the manager) for Tabasco and after 5 mins... nothing. Asked for the guy who took our order .. 3 mins ... nothing ... our hostess walked by and we asked her .. a little while goes by and nothing .. then asked a 4th servicer and finally our hostess brings us our Tabasco!!!! I don't think it should take more than 15 mins to get a little bottle of hot sauce... and doesn't it normally come with it when you order oysters??   The oysters didn't taste that fresh. We also ordered the tsukemen and takiyaki.  The first thing I noticed when the taukemen came out was the film/layer of the fat and oil? On top of the soup (can be shown in my photo) thats a little off putting... and the ramen was $17.  Did not really taste the octopus in the takiyaki .. mostly just batter... $8 for 5 pieces.  Food was decent but nothing special. Over priced and bad service.   Restaurant looks nice.  Will not come back or recommend to anyone. It's unfortunate because I wanted to try the omakase."}
{"text":"Just dropped by to enjoy a dinner with my family - for which we had great discussions in the nice environment. However, the food for their price is not that special. I could have gotten better ramen elsewhere. However the portions were just right."}
{"text":"Kiu seems to be a dumbed down version of Kingyo, with a very limited and boring menu selection.  Compared to its Kingyo brother restaurant, the menu here has more expensive items for less quantity.  Execution of the items are also not as good, an example would be the very dry chicken wings and very frozen tasting yellowtail collar.   Even the atmosphere is not as good, as it feels very much like a mall/chain restaurant rather than an authentic izakaya experience.  Our server also spoke cantonese, though I guess to serve cantonese speaking guests better.   One of the highlights of the meal would be the black garlic ramen (another white sesame ramen was bland) and stewed pork ribs, everything else was very small and uninteresting."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant but there's generally a huge hype around this place.  Kiu serves unconventional fusion Japanese good eats and while the concept is quite nice, their food isn't mind-blowing (especially when you've been spoiled by good sushi not in Canada).   Their fusion dishes (salmon tataki, karaage, etc.) are actually quite good.  The karrage is actually one of the best ones I've had anywhere so that one is a must order.  Their sushi and sashimi dishes, however, are very so-so.  Some of the sashimi I had last time wasn't entirely fresh and smelled very fishy.  I also tried their ramen, which was also very mediocre.  The broth lacked umami flavor and it just wasn't rich enough.    A good tip for Kiu...don't come on a Tuesday.  Tuesdays are cheap nights at the theatre and parking is a living nightmare here.  It took us a good half hour to find a parking space and at the end, the driver didn't even end up parking and had to go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Upping this to 4 stars. Kiu has really improved since my last visit, and their rotating specials never fail to amaze me. My recent visit had the curry spice drumsticks, steamed clam sake, and sweet shrimp carpaccio as specials. All were excellent and very creative as well.  Service is as excellent as ever, and the place has definitely gotten busy, so reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of the fancier looking Japanese restaurants in Markham. Ate the pressed sushi, takoyaki, ramen and chicken karaage (fried chicken) rice. The sushi was quite good, very flavourful ingredients, and takoyaki was decent. For ramen, it was ok, decent for a regular restaurant, but an actual ramen joint would do better. The chicken karaage was quite good, very crispy and not too much batter.  It seems like the decor is more of the upscale type.  A little more on the expensive side, but at least the quality is quite good!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party of 26 people (birthday dinner). Decor's nice but food was average. They offer a variety of appetizers, ramens, and sushis. Gives you the opportunity to have only a bowl of ramen or tapas style dinner.   Service for large groups needs fine tuning. We were split into 2 groups. First group placed their orders but the 2nd group received their food first. They also didnt have the tradition of doing seat numbers so dishes were being served wherever they felt like it. Some ramens got missed but it only took about 5 minutes for them to come out.   We also had birthday cakes and they were able to accommodate. No additional fees.   Recommend their bone marrow - very flavorful. Would prefer it over Tapagria's.   Located on the same level as Cineplex and Goodlife Fitness (2nd Floor)."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 stars restaurant (mainly because of the good service and desserts). I've been to Kiu for two times since it has opened and tried a couple of things from their menu.   Starting off with their ramen... They're isshin ramen, and I've had high expectations going in for a taste. The first time I had the white sesame isshin ramen. It was served with a small bowl with white sesame seeds on the side so you can grind it and adjust the taste as you like. The pork was tender and the noodles were chewy. However, the soup base was extremely salty, and I kept drinking water during and after the meal. The second ramen I've tried was the assari shoyu ramen, and I have the same conclusions: chewy noodles, good soft boiled egg but extremely salty...   I've also tried their assorted blow torch sushi. It came with a nice variety (salmon, mackerel, beef and one more fish). My favourite was the mackerel and my least was the beef. Overall, I was not entirely impressed with it since the rice portion was overwhelming and dry in the mouth.   Away from the negatives... Here are some good finds at Kiu: The kakarae (fried chicken) was amazing - juicy chicken! Their black sesame cheesecake ($8.50), which is new on the dessert menu, is SO YUMMY! You got to save room for dessert to try this slice of cake! Although it was on the higher price side, I thought it was worth it.   Kiu has great service (both times I've been there). The server always made sure to make rounds to see if we're okay and to fill up our cups with water even if the night is busy. Also, the sushi bar boys are friendly, contributing to the atmosphere.   All in all, would I go back? Probably, but definitely not for the ramen!"}

{"text":"Exemplary service is what propels Kiu Japanese restaurant to a 4 star. Their food is average with a fair price point.   The staff regularly checks in with our dining experiences at the perfect timing between me  chewing and scooping food into my mouth.   Decor and interior is spacey and open. Parking is excellent.    4/5 would return"}
{"text":"Great location, fantastic service, and tasty food that is well made. I came here with my husband before we went to the movies, and we had a fantastic time. Our waiter Jackie was superb! Some of the highlights were the lobster maki and the Japanese style fish and chips. They used lotus root for chips and they were yummy! The sushi and sashimi are first class, and they have a real Japanese chef making delicious creations. Must try the omakase. They do make their menu accessible to all budgets as you can get Ramen for $8. Best ramen in the city!! I really enjoyed this sparkling peach jelly sake that came in a can, and you had to shake it for a full minute! The decor is modern trendy, and the clientèle is young. Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant because surprisingly there are not that many decent Japanese restaurants in Markham that do well in both sushi/ sashimi and cooked dishes. Seating is also pretty comfortable and service is great! I enjoy their pressed sushi, Kyoto tofu, stuffed chicken wings, miso black cod and clams (it comes lit - on fire!). On my most recent visit, I noticed they added a Tsukemen to their menu and that quickly became my favourite over all the other ramens I have tried at this restaurant. If you like chewy noodles or flavourful broth, you won't regret the tsukemen! Its basically your typical ramen but the soup is served separately. You dip your ramen into the soup to get the flavour and then you eat it. There are not too many places in Toronto that serve tsukemen, so it's a nice addition."}
{"text":"A bit expensive, but a great place for ramen!   I've been to many ramen places since I tried ramen last year (shh, yes I know I was a bit late to the party), and Kiu is definitely on the top of my list for a good bowl of noodles. Price ranges from $13~$17, and they have different styles and soup bases. Most ramen includes pork belly cha siu, a marinated soft boiled egg, and green onions.   Got the Tokyo Style Light Shoyu Ramen (pictured). Was a bit surprised at how much flavour was in the soup base, because the soup based at a lot of the places I've been to before were very water-like. Really liked the flavour and slight creaminess of the soup base, and how all the ingredients harmonize together.   The atmosphere here is great, and lots of seating room. Waiters are very nice, but (sometimes) a bit slow to get your table cleaned or to take your order.   Haven't tried the sushi here, will update this review when I do!"}
{"text":"Kiu is officially my favorite lunch spot in Markham. Their tonkatsu set came with Kyoto style tofu and 2 other items.  Their miso soup has veggies in it! They've definitely put in some effort, all for $16.  I'm also impressed with their matcha Taro Crepe Cake.  unlike other crepe cakes I've had this one was not overly moist, nor was it overly sweet."}
{"text":"Friendly service,  food quality good,  place clean.  Not many choices for Sashimi.  Over priced."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place because it's just so...average. The taste is average, the price is average, the decor is average and just about everything about it is average. It's like that one kid in school no one remembers because he/she has never done any right or wrong.  Being in downtown Markham certainly helps to drive traffic, otherwise I can't see how it'd survive elsewhere.   This place is the Merlot of Japanese restaurant - meh"}
{"text":"3.5  Pros: Very kid friendly during lunch time Service was great  Cons: No extra noodles option for ramen Prices for sushi are a bit on the high side  I came here on my day off for a lunch with my family. I was very surprised at how kid friendly this place is during the lunch.  I have passed by in the evening and saw it was jam packed so I can't say the same for dinner.  Lunch though, is totally doable with children.  In fact, there were tons of tables with plenty of small children around when I was there.  Another plus it this place has free underground parking which is a big help during the colder months.  Kiu is co owned by the owner of Ramen Isshin.  As such, you will basically find all the offerings of Ramen Isshin at Kiu as well.  Having gone to the downtown location myself, I can safely say the Ramen is just as good here as downtown. The only issue I have is that there is no option to order extra noodles.  I'm a big eater so when I go for ramen I always get the extra noodle option and was disappointed I couldn't do that here.  We didn't order the sushi, but from what I saw at a neighbouring table, it looked pretty good.  I do note that the prices are a tad on the high side.  9 and 15 pieces of sashimi for $25 and $40 respectively seems pricey to me.  I can get 18 for $10 at Bong for comparison.      I would totally recommend Kiu for Ramen at Lunch.  Most Ramen places are small and super busy nowadays.  Kiu has such a large seating area that it shouldn't have that problem.  Add in the super child friendliness of this place and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Heard about a new Japanese restaurant in the theatre complex in downtown Markham. Checked in for lunch to give it a try.  Overall, wouldn't come back here again.  Experience was just not worth the price and the menu is very small.  We had a Ramen for $13, Charashi Don for $20, and a small sashimi platter for $50. Lunch for 2 without alcohol was $100+ including tax and tip (in perspective it was $100 for a bowl of noodles, a bowl of rice, and some sliced fish)  All the prices were pretty steep!! So we had higher expectations.. Food was just ok..   Charashi Don was disappointing.. Couldn't taste the freshness or quality of the fish.. Mainly because it was chopped up.. Although it did have higher-end fishes in the rice bowl..  I guess I would prefer normal fish is a rice bowl especially if it was mixed up. I feel higher-end fish should be served individually, so I can actually taste and evaluate it.  Sashimi platter was ok.. It did serve deluxe items but not to my pallet.. I would rather choose the specific fish I want to eat, for example, I don't have a thing for sea bream.. But it was in the platter..  Didn't get a chance to try their hand pressed sushi - 8 pcs for $20... Would have been disappointed if none of them were my favourites..   Biggest pet peeve is you don't really get a choice of what you eat, it's just order and hope for the best. I guess another way of looking at it is \"surprise me :)\" but that didn't work on me this time..  Service and decor 4 Food quality 3 Food selection 1 Price 1  I guess that scores a 9/20 - 2 stars sums it up..  Could have given it a higher rating if it wasn't so expensive for nothing special."}
{"text":"Well, they are known for their ramen and running an izakaya as the owner runs the worthy Isshin chain and Kingyo Izakaya, but we opted for sushi here. They have a real sushi bar, a real sushi chef and the scarce oshizushi (Osaka style pressed sushi), which is hard to come by in this city. We will be back to enjoy the ramen, but the sushi was quite impressive. They have not compromised despite ramen being their main thing. The sushi chef (like the owner) is Japanese and knows his stuff. Every nigiri I tried was very good with flavourful fish and aromatic rice. The pressed sushi was also impressive, but the tuna was better than scallops. The sweet miso tasted like the Nagoya variety and not the best of ideas, but the pressed sushi was still recommendable.   The service was good, the waiter and waitress were sincere, the hostess at the door was polite and cute and the water was refilled quickly, food arrived on time and manager dropped by to say 'thanks.'  The restaurant was busy even for lunch. Perhaps knowing it is Japanese-owned and authentic Chinese-Canadians were in a rush to be there, but there were also Japanese customers at the restaurant. Moreover, the restaurant is next to a cinema, which should do wonders for foot traffic. We should, at least, be grateful that not everyone wants to stuff himself with crap junk food from a cinema or hamburger chain.  The restaurant and the washroom were clean and there is adequate parking despite a cinema being there. It is too bad that the restaurant's view is to a parking lot. Someone should plant a dozen trees or do something."}
{"text":"A fancier Japanese restaurant than what we had been to here in Toronto. Surprisingly, only slightly more expensive - perhaps because we came for their lunch service?   Their lunch menu consisted of mainly ramens and dons. We each went with our own selection and agreed to order their Aburi sushi (12 pieces) and nigiri (chef's selection) platter to share.  I did love the smokey flavor the torched sushi carried.... but the amount of fish to rice ratio was 1:3. In addition, the main flavor, aside from the smoke, stemmed mainly from the brûlée-d mayo. Okay to try but wouldn't order again.   Nigiri sushi - I only had the sweet shrimp - fresh and tasty. Everyone else seemed happy with his/her pieces. To be honest though, I always credit good nigiri sushi to the quality of the fish, not so much to the chef. That's just me.  Red dragon ramen or the ultimate salt bomb (how I referred it). I only managed to take in a couple of bites and forced myself to salvage the egg + two slices of meats. There was zero depth in flavor. My husband saw that I basically didn't touch my bowl and offered to eat some.. he also gave up after two bites. \"Not worth it\" - his words.   I also tried their shoya and dipped ramen - the general consensus was both were also salty but just not as bad as mine... I would recommend skipping ramens altogether.   Maybe dinner offers a better (less ramen heavy) menu? Their $70 omakase sounds appealing enough for a second visit."}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures and hearing great reviews from friends, I decided to try Kiu with my significant other. We ordered the Isshin Red Miso Ramen and Salmon Pressed Sushi. We were disappointed with both. The ramen was extremely salty and the pork was tough. The salmon pressed sushi wasn't anything special. For the price, I feel like the food should be better. There is room for improvement and I look forward to giving this restaurant a second try."}
{"text":"Inattentive waiters. Upon walking in, I was asked to sit at the Ramen bar! Spicy Red Miso Ramen was Garrrbage! \"Wok fried pork\" just means fried ground pork. Barely any mushroom (total of 1/8 of a mushroom). Mostly Ramen and bean sprouts! I've had better instant noodles at home! NO soba on the menu! What kind of resto advertising itself as a Japanese resto doesn't have soba noodles? \"Pressed\" sushi was just some western interpretation of sushi; screams unauthentic. Sashimi choice is pathetic. Meh. Avoid."}
{"text":"Nice place pretty decor.. Small small potion and ramen super salty.. Would I come back ?  Maybe not.."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out when it opened but never got a chance and didn't see many good reviews. Finally ended up coming and agree with reviews saying it's mediocre.   We had the makunouchi box, chicken karage, and ajuri pressed sushi.   Makunouchi Box consisted of 8 appetizers: Picked onions - meh Herring roe - average  Tofu with miso sauce - tofu didn't have a good texture Smoked ham - average  Tuna delicacy - very strong flavour - too much  Beef tataki - pretty good Black cod - best in the box - would get it separately next time Takowasa - not much octopus  Chicken karage came in 4 big pieces. I would view it as 8 pieces as they're so big. I felt they were over fried - a little too hard to bite into.   Ajuri pressed sushi was average - 8 pieces with 2 of each - tiger prawn, salmon, mackerel, and yellowtail.   For the price, I feel I could go elsewhere for better quality."}
{"text":"A Japanese trying to be a sports bar, sushi pricing is decent, overdid the service a little. Server keeps coming back every minute to see if we are ok and everytime we finish a dish. The server takes it away within 30 seconds.   It's a bit over staffed. But all in all I would go back again. Ramen is decent and convenient to the theatre next door."}
{"text":"I am giving Kiu 4 stars cuz of the food. But I'm writing this review because of the poor service today. It was a busy lunch hour but it was very awkward that they served 2 of the 5 people at our table first with their grilled salmon. And they finished their meals before the remaining 3 of us got our ramen. They did stop by after a while to tell us that the ramen bar was very busy. But should have given us an option to change our order, or appetizers on the house, or at least give an estimated amount of time it would take. It would have been nice if they had given us a coupon or something for the next visit for the inconvenience. Just suggestions to help ease customers' pain of waiting! That aside, the food here is delicious and my other visits to Kiu were much better. I love the Red Dragon ramen. Packed with flavour, lots of various spices, but really not spicy. It is a bit salty - which I noticed after eating about half of it. But still tasty. Ramen was good and chewy. Also, when I came last time with a toddler, the service was excellent - they are very kid-friendly. He dropped food everywhere but they were cool about it. I'll definitely come back but hope this experience was just a fluke."}
{"text":"This place was quite busy for a weekday night. The decor and ambiance are lovely. Great place for a date night or just hanging out with friends or family. The service was really good.   I ordered the spicy vegetarian ramen. This was my first time having ramen so I don't have much to compare to. I was blown away by the flavours in this ramen. The noodles were good and the veggies were good. I really liked the soy crumble. The level of spice was perfect for me, although I usually eat much spicier food.   This is easily a new fave go-to for me in Markham. I'll definitely be back to have this same dish again and again unless I get courageous enough to venture away and try something new!"}
{"text":"I have been trying out their lunch and dinner ever since they open, but recently I ordered their party tray for the first time. The online order system is very convenient and you can just pick it up anytime you want. The sushi is just as great as usual. But one thing I am not happy with it, is they put the tray at the reception before the customer arrives (even I am on time). Since I have no idea how long did they leave it there, it may be not that fresh."}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant! Foods are amazing! Especially love the steamed egg bowl and sesame ice cream! Staffs are catering and super nice! My husband and I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place always seems packed so make sure you have a reservation. I've always gotten mixed reviews about this place so I finally decided to give it a try. We ordered pork belly, stuffed chicken wings, salmon carpaccio, slim tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and 11 pc of nigiri sushi. The stuffed chicken wings weren't anything special, but the pork belly literally melted in my mouth and it was so delicious! The salmon carpaccio was also on par. The best part of the meal was the chefs choice of 11pcs of sushi and the sashimi! The tuna sashimi wasn't too fatty and melted. The salmon sashimi was also super fresh. The sushi was also delicious. Overall the meal itself was super satisfying! I wouldn't recommend getting the ramen if you're very picky because it's honestly not that good compared to everything else on the menu they have to offer. I'm definitely going to bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"Didn't try their pressed sushi cuz of the bad reviews. I saw them in person lol good I didn't order. But the Chirashi and BlackSesameRamen are not bad. The Chirashi could be better with more sweet soya sauce on top. The ramen is a little too salty. I still like Ramen Isshin the best.  The view and atmosphere there are pretty nice. I would go back again and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"If you intend on impressing your date, this place is going to be your best bet in Markham. You get a good view of Downtown Markham in a rather classier looking restaurant with a centre stand of sushi chefs working on your food. The servers are also dressed to cater to your feel of luxury while a bar stands in the front of the restaurant.  Food is OK. You are looking at a rather pricy bowl of ramen and additives. They do have lunch specials but they are still on the expensive side of things, as much as $28.  As a ramen addict, I have to say that the noodles are just a little too thin to my liking. The soup is very, very flavourful with options that could ignite the palette quite a bit. We ordered the roasted garlic shoyu ramen which I thought was good but pretty strong with an overpowering garlic residue. I personally do like garlic so that didn't bother me until I realized after the meal, I would probably have to talk to people. We also ordered the tokyo shoyu ramen which was more classic with a broth that was less powerful, but probably a wiser choice in hindsight for a date.   In addition we added the extra $3 for the takoyaki octopus balls. They were the highlight of the meal! I highly recommend them and you won't be disappointed. The balls had great flavour and the octopus inside is always a pleasant surprise (yet not surprising) little addition.   Overall it gives a great impression if you are having your first date with someone. But honestly, I wouldn't be a frequent visitor here as the prices are on average $3-5 more and I prefer the santouka and sansotei ramen craze."}
{"text":"The place looks good kinda modern minimalistic take . But we weren't there for to look at the interiors . The food overall was good but we thought it was overrated and overpriced . I can get the same food elsewhere, same quality if not better and more reasonably priced. U were probably paying for the ambience"}
{"text":"Update: Sat at the sushi bar for the first time and got a good glimpse of how good this place operates.  They check every dish coming out the sushi bar to make sure it's all up to quality standards.  Sashimi was great and this time tried a variety of different apps - all were great.   Pork belly was good as well as the appetizer box.     Original: Been here quite a few times already and have met with a lot of the staff and the owner/manager from Vancouver.  All awesome friendly people.  And most of their names start with a \"J\" which was funny weird.   We usually get their ramen noodles (I like the black sesame) and some sushi dish (either pressed or one of their specials) and that's a pretty good meal.   They also have a baked oyster dish that's quite tasty as well.    The ambience is nice being upstairs with the big open windows and an open noodle bar in front of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise. Went here on a date with my wife and left the kid at home! We weren't expecting much due to the reviews but it was close to the movie theatre so what they hey! The menu was a hybrid of a ramen joint and 'high end' sushi restaurant without the selection. Normally this wouldn't be our kind of thing but everything was prepared well and tasted good. The service was exceptional (Jackie is the shiz)! The ramen was no better/worse than Sansotei and not as salty. We only ordered a lobster maki roll from the sushi menu to test the waters and that was great! The black cod fish and chips was delightful and the raw oysters were on point. The dessert (jap coffee panna cotta and black sesame ice cream) were also very good. I hope this place keeps it up as it's a decent place to eat before the movies - better than Cineplex food by far. The ambience is nice and crowded but still comfortable. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place in the afternoon, just out of all the yummy photos I've seen and I'm close to this location.  The decor and everything at this place looks top notch, something you'd only find downtown. The ramen here is pretty good, not too salty. But I must say... the prices are pretty expensive here. Especially their pressed sushi, I've had better even at Kinka Izakaya for half the price.   Service is average at the table, we had to ask a couple times to get our water topped up.  I'd come back only for the ramen... Everything else is just overpriced."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see this restaurant finally open in the Markham Theatre.  We come to this theatre a lot so having another restaurant is great.  Came here last Sunday night and luckily we made reservations as the place was completely full.  The decor was very modern and the table that we were at was very comfortable.  The drawback to this place is that there aren't too many choices on the menu.  If we were in the mood for sushi, we would have to select one of the combo which were really pricey and portion was very small.  We had the Aburi Sushi (7 pieces) and Nigiri (9 pieces), each combo for $30 each which were tasty but a bit pricey to come here regularly if we wanted just sushi.  If we were just coming here for izakaya (small dishes for sharing), we could order one sushi combo and other dishes but there wasn't that many izakaya dishes to select.  We ended up ordering 2 ramen- white sesame & roasted garlic which were perfectly done and these were good dishes to fill us up.  The lunch menu looks better with rice bowl options which I think they should add to the dinner menu.  I did really enjoy the ramen so we'll probably be back for that."}
{"text":"Wanted to give Kiu a higher rating but there's room for improvement.   Situated on the second floor of the Enterprise plaza (where the theatre is), most people have definitely passed by it at one point or another while driving. The location is nice but you don't get much of a view with all the buildings around.  Going into the restaurant, it's pretty spacious and clean with a bar on the left of the entrance and a sushi bar on the right when you go further in. There's a good number of seating but if you're coming here on the weekend it might be better to make a reservation. I wouldn't say the place is loud but don't expect a date-like atmosphere.  Onto the food. Oysters, beef tataki, sushi and sashimi, ramen, chicken, and desserts were on the menu for us.  The oysters were pretty fresh and nicely presented. A bit on the small side, though. Good for 2 ppl maybe.  The beef tataki was good, quite flavourful and very colourfully presented and a nice touch with the pomegranate garnish. A lighter touch on the oil would've been better, otherwise a nice dish.  The sushi I could've skipped; nothing too special about them except they were shaped... same with the sashimi.  The ramen was pretty good, though. Noodles were chewy and the broth wasn't too salty or bland, which you wouldn't expect from an izakaya, especially with Sansotei down the block.  Tried their stuffed chicken wings as well. Good... but nothing \"wow\" there. The wings were nice and crispy while the inside was tender and slightly stuffed. But, flavourfulwise, could've had this elsewhere.   Desserts! They do give out free ice cream (usual flavours) if it's your birthday, which is always a nice gesture. They also offer crepe cakes; the matcha one here was pretty good.   Kiu is probably better with cooked food as opposed to their sushi/sashimi (at this point). Pricewise = acceptable."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a weekend lunch before Halloween. No one was at the front when we walked in but they came soon. The interior is nice, attendants were dressed up for the Halloween. Ordered the Red Dragon Ramen and the Grilled Salmon lunch combo. The Ramen was average, and was therefore overpriced for what we got. Although, the egg was made near perfectly for the ramen. The grilled salmon dish was like any other salmon at any other restaurant. Was smaller than what I expected. It came with miso soup, a salad and 2 shrimps. The shrimp was breaded well. The waiter(Jason) was timely and knowledgable about the menu. Overall experience was average. Menu was overpriced for the food quality."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  We went to try it out and ordered a variety of items to share, each one exceeding out expectations!   We shared the miso seabass, roasted garlic ramen, each variety of the torched sushi, kiu special maki roles, unagi hand roll and a flight of sake.   The presentation was very pretty and the service was great!  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been to Kiu many times and they have been very consistent with the quality of food. What I like about their menu is that they have very expensive sushi/sashimi and ramen dishes (~$20+), but if you're looking for something cheaper (~$10) they have some very reasonably priced dons (rice bowls) and shoyu based ramen as well.   I usually get the Chicken Karaage Don and the chicken is always very crispy and plentiful (although during my most recent visit, I felt there was a little less chicken than previous times) and rice is cooked well. Cha Shu Don (pork belly rice) is decent for its price ($7) but it is not as flavourful (pork belly should be succulent!!) as I would have liked. They seem to have gotten rid of their Tenshin Don (a egg, snow crab rice bowl) which was the most worth it and filling bowl. They've replaced it with a new \"Fishdon\" ($6) which is mostly just salmon and salmon roe, and we were told it's the size of a small rice bowl. Pretty disappointed.  In terms of their ramen, my favourite is the Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen because it is affordable ($11) and is packed with yummy garlicky flavours in the soup. The noodles are also very well made, but their ramen (atleast in their Shoyu series) is lacking toppings.  I also ordered their Chirashi don ($18) before, but I remember I did not like it very much because the selection was not great, and it was relatively small for such a high price point.  Overall, I think Kiu is a good place to eat with a group of people because they don't specialize in ONE thing. In other words, everyone will be satisfied with SOMETHING on the menu. However, I will not come here if I am specifically craving sushi, or ramen, or a rice bowl because I know much more affordable and worth it restaurants."}
{"text":"I would only come here for their omakase sushi. Their aren't that much selection in their normal dinner menu, and portions are small and quite over priced. As for lunch they don't serve the izakaya items so essentially only the Ramen would be the go to option.  Omakase Sushi ($120 per person) There are only 8 seats at the bar for omakase so you have to make reservations 2 days in advance. The 2 day notice is because they have to pre-order the fish from Japan. 20 course meal mixed with sashimi, sushi, grilled fish, cooked food, and dessert. All 20 courses were really good. The fish was fresh, and every dish was well seasoned and flavored. I like how they prep their sushi - the chef adds small condiments to the sushi to help bring out the flavor of the fish.  At my visit they served grilled blue fin tuna cheeks! This is really rare, the highlight of my night. It tasted really good - soft but slightly chewy.  I also really liked how they served the uni sushi. They provided a towel soaked in matcha tea for you to wipe your hands. This is supposed to bring out the flavor of the uni. They then directly serve 2 pieces of uni sushi in your hand (one piece male and one piece female). Did you know uni has gender as well? The dark dirty yellow looking color is male, and the lighter bright orange color is female.  Overall the experience was amazing - it was like a mini performance watching the chef prepare and cook each course. Of all omakases that I've been to, this is definitely the bang for your buck spot in terms of the raw fish quality, the selection of fish, and the number of courses offered for that price. It's rare to eat omakase that's filling and too full for dessert!"}
{"text":"Very nice eatery in Markham. You can eat here after you watch your movie-better than the Odeon VIP...Japanese modern food mixed with Asian fusion. My partner in crime and I ordered roasted garlic Shoyo Ramen, deep fried chicken Karaage, 8pieces of pressed shushi (aburi- torched) and maki rolls of chopped blue fin tuna. To top it off we got jelly saki-fruity flavor, Ikezo. Popular worh the  female clientele. The good: great atmosphere and presentation is nice. You can get a good selection of beer including Sanpora Japanese beer. The bad: it is on the pricey side but they do have specials for oysters on Mondays and affordable Japanese beers after 9pm. The Ugly: unfortunately to be this good it is $$$-$$$$. One thing though, they were blasting top 40s music gives it a bizarre feel in a Japanese restaurant. Tip: if in a group or if you want to try something different, starting from $70 you get the chef's choices -Omasake (unique shushis) from appetisers to main meal- the only place in Markham that offers this.."}
{"text":"To be fair, I've only tried that ramen there, so my review is only based on their ramen. First of all, the environment is nice and location is convenience since it's in the same building as the theater. I've tried their Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen ($13+tax) and Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen ($13+tax). My friend and I both think their ramen is WAY too salty...I've been there twice, with different friends and they all think the same way."}
{"text":"i was taken here after watching x-men apocalypse which i really enjoyed as a big x-men fan. but i digress.  we shared a chicken karaage and isshen red miso ramen. both were absolutely delicious. the chicken karaage was nice and juicy.  the ramen was very flavourful. ingredients tasted extremely fresh and high quality. i added in a marinated soft boiled egg, that was bomb too. definitely makes me look at ramen a bit differently."}
{"text":"I went with my vegetarian friend just before we went to watch our movie.   I ordered the chicken kaarage and the roasted garlic shots ramen and she got the vegetarian spicy ship ramen and agedashi tofu.   I wish I could've tried the sushi but it was very expensive and didn't seem worth it in my opinion. The chicken kaarage was juicy and crispy bu I was disappointed in my ramen. The broth was a bit too salty in my opinion but I loved the texture and firmness of the noodles. I just wish it was a bigger portion.    My friend loved her vegetarian ramen and the agedashi tofu. We were a bit surprised that the agedashi tofu came with broth but she said it was really good.   We got there around 6:30 (with reservation) and were able to make it to our 7:40 movie. The service was great and they were attentive.   I enjoyed my experience overall but I don't think I'll be coming back again just because of how pricy it can get."}
{"text":"Service: Extremely attentive; servers were very knowledgeable about items on the menu and items being served.   Ambiance: very spacious and comfortable environment; perfect for families or a date!  Food: - Beef Tataki: Not the best I've had but a very distinct flavour compared to those I've had. I think the garlic puree placed on top of each slice in addition to the scallions give that distinct taste. You get a glimpse of every flavour from the garlic to the green onion and the gamy of beef before it all comes together nicely.  - Uni Sushi: two pieces @ $9! That is $9 well spent I'd say. Taste and quality is there. I appreciate a dab of wasabi on top of the uni as it complimented the uni very well. The wasabi wasn't too powerful as you can still taste the sweetness of the uni. Superb!   - Lobster Ceviche with Scallop: Fresh lobster and scallop however, not very impressed with the ceviche. The flavour of the ceviche was not entirely there as it fell quite short.. It tasted more like a casual salad. I think more cliantro and red onions would definitely revive the ceviche.   - Nigiri Chefs Choice 11pc + Egg Castellai: I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi here. The sashimi laid on top each bed of rice is very fresh and it just melts in your mouth! I don't think I've ever had sashimi do such a thing in my mouth. Interestingly, there is no wasabi placed between the sashimi and bed of rice. Very satisfied with the sushi. The Egg Castellai has a spongey texture; quite moist and its taste is similar to a sponge cake.  - Baked Oysters: Didn't leave much of an impression on me. Pretty much tastes like what it sounds like; very light flavour.   - Isshin Ramen: Love the broth here! Very aromatic and not as meaty-tasting compared to other ramen broths that I've tried. Definitely dive in on the meat first as it will become too cooked in the hot broth. Noodles were tender and its texture is just right.   Drinks: - Pineapple Sangria: can't really go wrong with the sangria! A hint of the wine can be tasted however, overall it has that citrus taste.  - Goren Cocktail: Mmm.. guava.. It tasted like a tropical fruit punch which I didn't really mind.   Would definitely recommend Nigiri Chefs Choices and their Uni!!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior design and comfortable environment. The service was great but the ramen soup was warm and a little too salty .I wish they can offer more options for the appertizer & sushi menu. Hopefully my next visit they will have some improvement."}
{"text":"Walking in to this restaurant, I knew it was trying to be high end. Everyone we walked by bowed and greeted us. We had two servers (I'm assuming one was the actual server and the other was the bus boy) who came over to introduce themselves.   I was very excited with the menu as everything looked good. I ordered the Chirashi lunch and was really disappointed. It was $20 and said would include tuna, yellow tail, sea bream, shrimps, uni. I was expecting slices of fish but all the fish was chopped up. Quality of fish was lacking and the pickled bamboo overpowered any taste left from the fish. I was unimpressed and slightly pissed because now I want a decent bowl of Chirashi.  During our meal, there was a line of servers just standing at the end watching us. We felt intimidated being watched the entire time; but funny enough, they didn't notice when we were out of tea.  Overall the ramen was ok. Could probably find equal quality for a cheaper price. I would not recommend the sushi or sashimi."}
{"text":"Ramen is one of the best I've had in Markham! Only tried the sushi once. It was okay, but definitely recommend the original white sesame shio ramen!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner out of convenience as it is right inside the Cineplex building and looked decent. While the service and ambiance was good, I felt the food was a little pricey for the quality. I tried sashimi, aburi sushi and ramen, which were all nicely plated. The sashimi and sushi were decent but the ramen was very mediocre for a restaurant that has a ramen bar. The food is not bad but not worth the prices in my opinion."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5   My lunch experience at Kiu was surprisingly good. I like how you can make a reservation online, even though it was not too busy during lunch.  We were welcomed and seated promptly. Service was fast and efficient. We ordered a few items to share and delicious. Portion though on the smaller side but it is what one expect at a higher end Japanese restaurant.  Great to meet up with friends for a leisure lunch meetup.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was good, except for the Kyoto milk tofu appetizer. Would not recommend ordering it."}
{"text":"Kiu is a beautifully decorated Japanese restaurant in the Cineplex VIP building, which makes it a great central location.   Service is friendly, prompt with requests, and consistent (especially as there was a shift change during our meal - we were notified our waitress was coming off her shift but there was no lull in service & very seamless).   Had the plum wine (Takara), red miso ramen, pressed sushi, aburi sushi, and bone marrow. Overall quality is quite good and presentation was great. Found the ramen a little to salty for my liking. The sushi was pretty good - not bad but not amazing. The rice is not to the caliber of other restaurants like JaBistro or Miku and the beef aburi was a bit bland. Prices are on the pricier side especially for the quantity and quality.  They also offer an omakase that I would like to try in the future.   The restaurant is relatively new, so there is room to improve but overall it's a good restaurant and I would return for everything but the ramen."}
{"text":"Apparently you really need to order omakase before 830. Our friends didn't arrive until 845 and was told it was too late to order omakase. So ended up going with ramen. Portions kind of small the soup base was on the saltier side. The appetizers were ok I wouldn't say anything special."}
{"text":"1.5/5  First off, I really did not like the ramen I ordered. For $13 I got what felt like a heavy hand of instant noodles, topped with two slivers of bland pork, some bamboo shoots, HALF of an overcooked egg, and an overly salty soup base - A RAMEN NIGHTMARE.  Perhaps I've been spoiled with the likes of Michelin-grade ramen from Bay Area, Japan, and Toronto, but I was incredibly disappointed with the quality.  To make things worse, since I didn't want my leftover ramen to go to waste, I just decided to pack it away. The server kindly offered to package the ramen soup and noodles separately for me in plastic containers, and placed them into a plastic bag... To my dismay, the soup container lid was not sealed properly and there was a  small hole at the bottom of the plastic bag. The soup leaked in my purse and all my possessions were ruined. I would strongly advise everyone who packs away their food to make sure everything is sealed properly, and that they pay extra attention to the containers... they're very poor quality and can easily be opened with additional force.  Do not get the ramen here ppl!!"}
{"text":"Kiu's located right next to the cineplex odeon in enterprise plaza in markham.  I've been here probably ten times the past couple months because it is extremely kid friendly, and my son absolutely adores the ramen here. He's a fan of the basic bowl of Shio (salt), and i've tried many different items on the menu, all of which i have enjoyed.  For lunch, try the Unagi rice which is outstanding (23 CAD)....and the spicy salmon hand roll (4.5 CAD). I'm also a fan of all the sushi variety here....the uni sushi, ikura sush all up to par w/ the better sushi joints.  As long as this place keeps the kids happy, I think i'm likely going to frequent this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service was friendly and fast. Food was great ( ordered the white sesame ramen ).  What impressed me was they have two sizes for ramen!"}
{"text":"Kiu tries really hard to be a cross between the likes of Kinton and Jabistro - they tried so hard that they forgot how to hire good staff.   Extremely disappointed in the service I recieved at this establishment, and was surprised too, considering this seemed like an upscale place in downtown Markham. So sorry folks, it's going to be a long one cause I've got lots to say about this place.  I came here for a birthday dinner and dropped off a cake half hour prior to arriving with the birthday boy. When I dropped off the cake, the hostess hurriedly took it, asked who the reservation was under and then closed the door (as it didn't open till 5:30).  When I arrived with the birthday boy and another friend, the hostess asked the birthday boy if the reservation was under his name which he said yes and she prepared to grab our menus and take us to our seat. However, she paused, realized she forgot to tell me that there's a $8 cutting fee for the cake. She said it right in front of the birthday boy - smart.... My friend and I widened our eyes and she still didn't take the hint. When you train your staff, please remind them that they're supposed to pull that person away and tell them privately and when they mess up like this, at least offer to discount the cake cutting fee. My experience was already off to a bad start.  Ok so we finally sat down, surprised was spoiled, and started ordering food. Our waiter was shy and awkward and definitely not the type of service you'd recieved from the likes of Jabistro, so again, not impressed. One item of food came first for the entire table and we waited about 20 minutes till the rest of the food came - was someone supposed to eat on their own while everyone watched?? Here's what you're supposed to do in this case Kiu, if making sushi is faster than ramen, make the sushi roll closer to when all the ramen is ready so you can serve it at the same time. Especially since the sushi wasn't an appetizer!! Geeze - the basics of serving at a restaurant. You also don't reach your hand and grab a dish and then ask after the fact if your customer is done eating lol.  In terms of food - ordered their dipping ramen and their Kiu specialty roll. Most of the party ordered ramen and all of us agreed that the broth was way too salty. Luckily since mine was the dipping one, I was able to not drink as much broth. Their Kiu specialty roll on the other hand was great! If I were to ever come back, I'd stick with their sushi instead - but with how things went, I doubt I'd come back - for the price, ambience, and sushi, I could definitely find much better places elsewhere... though understanding that options are limited in Markham.  So when the time came to finally serve the cake, the waiter blatantly asked straight up if we wanted the cake - again, right in front of the birthday boy! Not one mishap from a staff, but from 2 staff members! So anyway, the waiter went and placed the dishes and forks first - again, adding more to the ruining of the surprise. What are we supposed to do here Kiu? Well, serve the cake first and then give the dishes after if you wanted it to be a surprise! Ok so now how did the waiter serve the cake? He stood right at the corner in plain view attempting to light the candles, I have never face palmed so much at how unaware the staff were of their actions.    Tldr; not so smart staff with good (not excellent) sushi and super salty ramen at a convenient location. If you're a Japanese food and good service lover, you'd skip this place."}
{"text":"Not your typical Japanese restaurant located in the core downtown of Markham right beside the Cineplex. If you are looking for traditional sushi then this is not the place. If you want pressed sushi and ramen then check this place out. The press sushi wasn't  too bad and for the price. The ramen was above average the noodles taste like fresh noodles and chewy. Try the black sesame ramen for a different experience you will need to grind your own black sesame.   Price wise this place is a little on the higher side."}
{"text":"In a city filled with izakayas and a culture obsessed with variety (choosing to cater to a populace that values quantity over quality...sadly), I decided to give Kiu a shot in hopes of rekindling some of that magic I experienced back in my hometown of Tokyo. Sorry, I lied. Tokyo is not my hometown (I was born and raised here), but I certainly wish it were. Anyway, Kiu isn't considered an izakaya, but do not specialize in one area of food either, like back in my would-be homemetropolitan. They do have more items on their menu than I would like, which meant taking a hit in quality. If you don't believe me, ask Gordon Ramsay. I watched this episode of Hell's Kitchen once where he was furious with the restaurant owner for putting a million items on their menu, none of which were cooked even half-decently. Quality over quantity. Seriously. It's one of the reasons why Michelin star execs gloss over Toronto in their nominations. I know, because I am one of those execs. No, I'm not. I lied again. At this point, you're wondering how credible or valid any of my reviews are when I'm constantly lying to you. The answer to that is not very. And honestly, I wouldn't trust the opinions of anyone coming from Toronto to review food. We don't do food well, and that's truth. So yeah, I had their tsukemen ramen. It was alright. The broth was good, but otherwise, that's it. They were apparently rationing pork, since the slices were super thin. 3 stars. Mind you, this place is still preferable to the izakayas I've had in this city. Would I come again? Well, I don't have a choice really. What else is there in the area? The Subway downstairs? No thanks, bud."}
{"text":"Kiu has lived up to its reputation in my opinion. Pricey and delicious is exactly what I expected. We went for dinner on a Saturday night just before 7pm and were seated right away but there were at least 2-3 groups waiting when we left. Our server, James, was very knowledgeable and explained the menu to us thoroughly once he knew that it was our first time there. He showed us the popular items, explained how certain items were made and what ingredients are used. After tax + tip, I paid ~$160 for four people.  They were not offering the Okonomiyaki so I ordered the next best thing, Takoyaki (5 pcs, $8). It was good and had a decent proportion of octopus. Not sure that I would order this again for the price and because there's so many other things on the menu to try instead.  Live Lobster Sashimi ($60) - this is ~1.5 lbs of lobster and comes with two lobster soups, but of course isn't a lot of sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and sweet. The soup was delicious and also sweet. Enjoy it while it's hot because it gets a bit salty once it cools down. I thought \"live\" was synonymous with \"fresh,\" but in this case, the lobster head was literally twitching on the plate in front of me. Of course it freaked me out and I made our server turn the plate around ASAP! I think this is a must-try but not something I would order every time I go.  Lobster Ceviche & Hokkaido Scallops ($19) - For the price, this was slightly smaller than I expected though I am aware that neither lobster and scallops are cheap. However, I would 100% order this again! It is marinated in a lime soysauce and the first bite is incredibly refreshing! The scallops are so fresh.   Torched Salmon Sashimi (6 pcs, $13) - This was so, so good and exploding with flavour. It reminds me of the one at Joey's. We also ordered two ramens but in the future, I would opt for a second plate of this instead of the ramen.  Roasted Garlic Shoyu Ramen & Kotteri Rich Shoyu Ramen ($13 each) - These are their two most popular ramens. I'm personally not a ramen fan so I don't have much to say. The thin noodles had a good texture but there was nothing special about the pork. The Kotteri Rich was salty but the Roasted Garlic was even saltier! We were assured that if we come back, they could make it significantly less salty. It's always tricky the first time!"}
{"text":"Beautifully presented food, and delicious. Slightly more creative than a typical Japanese restaurant, but still traditional. Will definitely return. Also, very convenient if you're going to a movie, as the Cineplex is right across the hall."}
{"text":"just ok. probably best tsukemen you will find anywhere near markham, but still small portion. noodles werent properly folded and theres too little broth. tastes exactly the same as ramen isshin downtown (same owner)  -1 star for imposing 15% gratuity on bill"}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner on a Wednesday evening. So early that we were the first to be seated. Our server was knowledgeable and patient with us in explaining the specials (1/2 price seafood yakitori and the daily creation), portion sizes, Japanese terms we didn't know, etc.   I suppose since we were the only customers in the restaurant our food came out quick. The daily creation of octopus seaweed salad, cod tempura and beef tartar was quite good. The portion is small but you get a good taste of the 3 different dishes. My favourite skewer was the scallops. They were cooked perfectly. The don came out looking beautiful. All the different colours popped and was so visually appetizing."}
{"text":"Located on the second floor of the Downtown Markham Mall, this place is made for the Dating crowd - especially the movie date night.  There is a VIP Cinema across the hall.  Kiu is larger than I expected.  They have a tight but comfortable seating area.  Their large open kitchen, Isshin Ramen Bar and the Sushi Bar - best place to sit if you do the Omakase.  The dishes are varied and can fit most palettes and cravings.  You want to try everything as you witness expertly plated food pass your table making decisions difficult.  Dinner was Takoyaki, Chicken Karaage, small selection of Aburi Oshi Sushi and Maki, and a dessert.  To help wash things down, a Saison Du Japon and a Kagua Brown (insane 9%) beers.  Each of the offerings were prepared fresh and perfectly presented.  We do eat with our eyes and with that, I was famished.  Each morsel of food was delicious.    I'm not a fan of \"torched\" sushi, as the gas used to char can infuse a mal-taste, but nothing of that nature here.  Each piece was enjoyable and dressed with edible flowers.  Happy Valentine's Day 2018!  I purposely waited for today to write this review.  For those of you who decide to participate in this wildly panicked day in hope to impress and romance, Good Luck!    If have a Movie and Kiu Japanese on the plans, I hope you made reservations a while ago, and have gone to your ATMs.    This place packs up each night and the food, decor, ambiance...all worth it.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Given that I live a close 5 minutes away from the restaurant, I have always wanted to try but had pushed it off until now.   I can see that the restaurant is usually packed so if you're a bigger group you should definitely make reservations ahead of time. We were lucky enough to snag a seat without waiting at 1:30 on a Saturday, before we head to the movies at 2:15.  First of all, the main reason I feel that they deserve this rating is due to their incredible service! The servers were there whenever you needed them, were super friendly, and never forgot to check in with you. The food came super fast as well, which would have been an issue because we had only 30 minutes to spare before the movie started (we took a risk with that).   I saw that many reviews said that they were overpriced but I felt that it was justified, for the lunch menu at least.  Most izakayas and higher-end sushi restaurants are around that price range, not to mention the location of this restaurant - I can imagine the rent for plaza is not cheap!   They have a extensive range of sake at Kiu, to my delight, and offer some of them to be heated up for you. Hot sake is my guilty pleasure during the cold winter months so I was exceptionally happy to hear that. We ordered the Okunomatsu Kinmon ($22) which was refreshing, but could have warmed up a bit more as we were used to drinking hot sake at a higher temperature.   The food was amazing! Definitely recommend the red dragon ramen (if you like spicy) for $16 and the assorted fish don ($6) and especially the cha shu don ($7) it just melts in your mouth! The portions of the dons were small but worth if for the price, so you can get 2.   Overall, the service was great, the food came fast and tasted amazing. Would recommend if you're craving high end sushi, ramen, or izakaya dishes if you're in the Downtown Markham area."}
