{"text":"This place is called Castillo Mexicano now. It has new management and is really great. Hands down the best Mexican food in the Cleveland metro and the back patio view is spectacular.  We got there late and the food was still fresh. I got the fajita taco salad with chicken and my husband got the chicken flautas. The chicken was very moist and seasoned very well. I suggest if you have a choice of meat, get the chicken... I digress.  They also served fresh guac with both of our meals that was super yum and it did not cost extra!  Overall, the food was great as was the service. Even though we live in brecksville we might drive the hour again for this place : )"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed coming to \"The Castle\" for Mexican food.  However, the previous owners let the place run down and we stopped coming.  We found out there were new owners so we went there last night.  We were very impressed!  The food was great, the service was very good and we could see that they are making improvements to both the building and the food!  I'm bummed that I missed the whole summer and not being able to sit and enjoy the view from the patio, but at least it seems that they are on the right track now!   If you have been disappointed in the past you may want to give it another try!  I'm glad we did!  We really enjoyed the chips and salsa, guacamole, and Fajitas Texanas!  We added chorizo sausage to it and it was simply wonderful!!!  Everything was served hot and fresh and there was nothing to complain about at all!"}
{"text":"I would give the food the five stars because honestly the fajitas were absolutely amazing and the chips and salsa have a very fresh taste.The service would probably be a 3.5 but I'll sacrifice the few little mistakes etc for the quality of food we had cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio which was very beautiful.. Other than that we waited 45 for our food .. Than 2 of our kids dishes came out it looked absolutely horrible! We paid for our beverages and left before even getting our food . Our waiter was great i felt really bad for him . Seeing that he was the only person running his ass off everyone else seemed clueless!  .. Never once seen a manager ! I will never return ! I recommend never trying this place ."}
{"text":"Great find on the shores of Lake Erie. This \"castle\" is enormous and the Mexican is really good. Fast service, great outdoor seating and yummy fish tacos -what else is there?"}
{"text":"First time here, no complaints with the food, just your typical Mexican restaurant. The menu is very large and overwelming, would be nice to see a smaller menu"}
{"text":"We've been dining in this restaurant for more then 6 years. The place was closed for months. The waiter was the best of the whole restaurant. He was very nice and professional. The food prices went up. I ordered my favorite I used to eat here Fajita Taco Salad. First of all I barely found any meat in it! Raw onion and pepper covered with lettuce. My husband had Pork Carnitas. The meat was tasteless. The servers running around with walkie talkies. They have changed the seats and the tables in their boots. The tables are very low and the boots are too close so the sitting is uncomfortable. I loved this restaurant much better with the other management.  The outdoor place is beautiful though. I would go back but only for a drink on the patio."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. The beef had a funny taste, the rice was overcooked, and the beans were nearly flavorless. The only good thing was the service."}
{"text":"Great food, prompt and friendly service, interesting menu, reasonable prices for a very large and satisfying portion!  Lorain is lucky to have this place!  Fabulous view of the lake from the back patio."}
{"text":"Now Castillo Real. Waited 45 minutes and my carnitas dinner arrived cold. My friend's dinner had been given to another customer. When we finally caught our waitress 's attention, to tell her my food was cold and to ask where the other plate was, we were told they had a party of 30 and the kitchen was backed up and it would be at least another 30-40 minutes before we would get our new food. We left hungry."}
{"text":"The service was really slow the food was ok we ordered the exact same thing but it came complety  different. .I hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars. The food was horrible and the service was worse. Do not come here. I used to think all Mexican restaurants were the same until I came here and it was far below average. We came with 7 people and at least 5/7 thought their food was nearly inedible and felt ill the whole night after."}
{"text":"I definitely want to go back and eat here again. I had dinner on the patio. Shrimp fajitas and avocado salad were both very good. Our server was attentive and very polite; with a nice smile each time she came to our table.  I will be back! I'll wait til I go again to give it a 5th star as this was my first visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is under brand new ownership as of last week. I wish them the very best of luck at transforming this place into the most desirable Mexican eatery around. I can't wait:-)"}
{"text":"We noticed the banner saying under new management so we decided to give this place a try.  The good: The service from the waitress was excellent. She was on the ball and we did not have to ask for anything.  The bad: 1. The place smelled like an old musty house and it was so dark inside we could not read the menus.  2. It took 45 minutes to get our food after placing order with us being the only customers in the establishment.  3. The orders did not come out correct.  4. The fajitas, rice, beans, and tortillas all came out on the same plate. No sizzling skillet.  5. The quality of the food was not worthy of the price. The portions were a lot smaller than a typical Mexican restaurant and tasted like it came out of a can.  6. The restroom smelled like a basement and had no toilet paper; we had to use paper towels."}
{"text":"Currently in the hospital for extremely bad food poisoning. My friend who also ate lunch with me yesterday at this location has food poisoning as well. Will never return to this restaurant and unless you want to be throwing up for 6 hours, I hope you don't either."}
{"text":"There is literally nothing special about this place aside from the building. We dined here 6 years ago, apparently under different management, and decided to return to reminisce (we had just started dating when we first came here with a frouple, so we reenacted Valentine's Day 6 years later). I don't recall anything remarkable about the food--6 years is a long time--but this year, I can say that there definitely isn't anything remarkable about it.   The chips were a little floury--they really had very little flavor, but I guess that's what the salsa is for? My flautas were incredibly plain. There was no flavor to the tortilla and the meats were likely not seasoned at all. So, I piled on the guac and salsa and enjoyed my meal. A little more flavor really would have been nice, but we weren't coming here for the amazing food, we were coming here for memories."}
{"text":"Service - HORRIBLE server - apathetic; didn't offer drink refills; we ordered two meals - they came out 5 minutes apart and when the second one came, it was the wrong one! We had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the right meal to be served; had to hunt her down for the check; when the check finally arrived she charged us for two tequila drinks @ $7 each instead of two Coronas that we actually ordered. Had to get the bartender involved to help resolve the issue. It took us almost as much time to clear up the check fiasco as it took us to eat our meals. Thinking maybe our server was new to her job, I asked the bartender if it was her first day. He responded, \"No, but you would THINK so, huh?\"    Food -  The chips and salsa were good. As far as our entrees, just OK, nothing special about them.  Decor - Looks interesting from the street but once you get inside it's pretty garish/tacky. The patio overlooking the lake is probably the least offensive looking part of the dining room.  Bathrooms (mens room anyway) - in serious need of cleaning. Hot water would be a nice touch as well.  The only reason you may want to try this place is to see first hand just how horrible a server can be. The whole time you'll be wondering, \"Is it even possible for someone to be more apathetic about their job?!\" I'll spare you the aggravation and just tell you... No. It's not."}
{"text":"Server was horrendous. She never came back to the after she took our order. We had a party of 4 only 3 meals were brought to the table. My chicken burritto had maybe a teaspoon of chicken in it. Not going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in as a last minute decision while driving on lake road.  The building grabbed our attention as it looks like a castle! We were pleasantly greeted as we walked in and seated at a table with a partial lake view, which was beautiful as the ice was melted. The new owner happily chatted away with us, she is very involved in the day to day activities. The margarita I ordered was perfect, the fajitas were generous sized and prepared very quickly. As we finished our meal and talked more about the future plans with the owner she offered to show us the beach level bar and outdoor patio. All I can say is bring on the summer! Looking forward to margaritas by the lake!!!   I can not say enough wonderful things about this restaurant.  Stop in and see for yourself!!"}
{"text":"thought i would give this place another shot since \"new management\" but it is horrible. both of us who ate ended up getting extremely nauseous and sick. 10/10 would NEVER recommend and will never be returning. only positive thing about my visit was the view."}
{"text":"THE UP-SIDE:  Upon approaching this place for a good Mexican dinner, you'll probably find yourself wondering, \"Why are we going into a castle?\"  Once you get inside, make sure to be seated on the back patio if the weather allows.  In my opinion, taking dinner on the back patio of this restaurant is the main reason to take dinner at this restaurant.  The patio is spacious and the view is all lake.  Get here just before sunset, and you've got a great show to go with dinner.  Dinner?  It's good Mexican food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  I've never had a spectacular meal either.  It's just solid Mexican fare.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  While the back patio is a wonderful place to have dinner, the inside is sorely lacking in terms of decor and layout.  One gets the feel it used to be something else and the Mexican thing was sorta smooshed in after it left.  In fact, at one point this place was a medieval dining spot.    THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go for the patio dining experience and go at sunset.  'nuff said."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and her friends to get some drinks. It was all pretty good as far as northern Ohio can do Mexican food. I had the quesadillas ranello with chicken, really yummy , especially after I added some of my queso dip on top. Staff was very nice, which always helps. Not a bad place, good pricing too."}
{"text":"Great Marguerite and homemade salsa! Waiter very entertaining. Under New Management.  Fajitas were delicious and presentation  beautiful."}
{"text":"Ate here in March, the steak fajitas were very good as well as the margaritas, the view from the bar was even better."}
{"text":"I had a dinner with my husband on Friday April 1st 2016. The service was so so. The waiter was really nice but  slow. It looked like cleaning up the bar area and the tables were more important than getting our drinks on the table on time. Drinks were ok but for the price they were not the best... About the  food :big disappointment! My hubby ordered a burrito which supposed to be filled with beef and rice. It had 3 small piece of beef the rest was rice! My Fajita Taco salad was absolutely flavorless, had a few piece of chicken the rest was fried bean, burned peppers and onions with guacamole and shredded lettuce. Pitiful tasteless food for the price. We were sitting in the backroom next to the window in the corner of that room. The waiter turned two other tables around right next to us, set a group of people there so my husband had to stand up and sit on the other side of the table. The restaurant barely had guests....We could barely get out of there, 2-3\" left between the chairs and tables. Careless staff who only care about their tip!  I used to love that restaurant because not just the beautiful view to the lake but the excellent service and delicious food. I will go back if the terrace will be open but only for the view... perhaps will order a beer and some chips...."}
{"text":"Pros: The castle is lovely, stairs up to it are elegant.    Service: Service is good and attentive without being overwhelming. And the cranberry juice is not watered down.  Cons: Brought 2 wrong meals (other patrons) Can't understand music (aka your listening for words in esponol that you know)  Food: Rice- more crispy without flavor Enchiladas- good, but base is soggy Chips and Salsa- typical chips (non salted) and salsa semi watered down Steak- salty but other than that tasteless  Fries- unsalted soggy potato   Recommend- 50/50 Return- a big maybe  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, good service and got our dairy free request right. Nice table on the patio with full view of the lake. Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The food is good (??) not amazing but pretty par for the course at a reasonably priced Mexican restaurant, but the people who work here are super nice.  Like really really nice!  I would drive out here from CLE any time to support them. It also looks like the patio will be gorgeous in the summer."}
{"text":"They took a little while and it's under new management but other then that the food tasted good.   The decoration is pretty cool. The chairs are difficult to get out of. I literally had to hold the chair and bounce with it as I scooted back to excuse myself from the table. Kinda awkward.   As I put a taco in my mouth I saw one of the workers humping the air right next to my table cuz he was talking about his weekend...guessing it was good?  Pretty unprofessional...but pretty funny.   Our waitress was really nice   They sang happy birthday to me and smeared a little whip cream on my face it was fun."}
{"text":"I so much wanted this place to be good. Service was poor, waited 15 minutes for a drink refill, could hardly find the pork in the tamale. did I say the staff was unattractive?  Restrooms had no toliet paper. if they were busy i could understand. They weren't."}
{"text":"Management basically turned us away on a Saturday night,  saying there was a 30 min wait when there were clearly open tables.  Only open until 8 during \"winter hours\".  Sign out front says bar is open,  but that wasn't the case either."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time while on vacation.  The friends we were here to see had never been either.  I think we'll be back!  Definitely for the American, not 100% authentic Mexican, was tasty.  Our meals consisted of fajitas (salad-sized shrimp?), burrito, and cheese quesadilla.  All were nicely prepared.  Texas margarita was really good!  Negatives - Not enough guacamole. Salt on the margarita when asked for none, no frozen margarita, no water brought when asked.    Service for 8 was $96 not including tip - 4x adults, 4x kids.  I wish we could give 1/2 stars so I'd give 3 1/2 stars...I guess I'll round up for 4."}
{"text":"New owner and name change.  Was a good family meal.  Chips and salsa where fantastic!  Dinner portion sizes where massive.  One plate easily feeds two people.  Service was great and very courteous."}
{"text":"Finally, this restaurant has reopened. Needless to say, the outdoor patio is this restaurant's best asset. It's absolutely lovely to be able to have lunch on this patio with the best view of Lake Erie. On the other hand, the food has much to be desired. It's very typical. The yummy-looking burrito that I ordered was a far cry from the picture in the menu. I hate that. Eateries: stop displaying pictures of menu foods that are not realistic! It's so disappointing for customers who will not come back....#unsatisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"My companion ordered a chicken taco. Got beef. Complained and they said they'd remake it. They brought out another beef taco!!! They screwed up a screw up!!!!! The food was cold, rice had zero flavor. No checks on us or refills. We complained , no one cared. Charged full price for bad food and bad service. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!! AVOID!!!! I can not stress enough how bad this was!!! Please, heed my warning and go elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is absolutely horrible.  We haven't been back. We were sitting  outside and no one came to take our drink order. We waiting 10 minutes and finally went inside to get someone.   When our drinks came we asked for chips and salsa and that took forever. Someone finally brought us some and we told them we were ready to order and they said I'm not your waiter I'll find them.   It just took forever. For something to take 45 mins we were there way over an hour.   No re fills on chips or beverages."}
{"text":"I would love to review the food...if we had ever received it. After waiting an hour and only receiving two baskets of chips, we were told there was a large party on the patio and they were trying to get their orders in first. We would just need to be patient and they'll get to us when the large party was finished. They had every staff person on that party, leaving the smaller parties waiting and wondering. When our waitress went to find her manager, they were nowhere to be found. I'm very disappointed in the head staff but our waitress was wonderful and apologetic."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that there are pathetically few options for dining ON the lake in Greater Cleveland. I know a good bit about the food scene in town, and between here and downtown, you only need one hand to count them all. That is mystifying.   My rant brings me to El Arriero, which has an excellent patio overlooking the lake. The food is pretty good overall, the notable exception being the carnitas and chorizo, both of which are sublime. Porky excellence on those. Most everything else is run-of-the-mill NE Ohio Mexican, which isn't great. Much of the menu seems geared toward Americans. You can tell that the kitchen could do better if they were braver. Put some tongue or chicharrones on that menu! I know you have it in you. As it is, it's a burrito, fajitas, taco, etc. menu.   Service is good and there's Dos Equis on tap along with some respectable pure agave tequilas (note: I skipped the margaritas because they are made with nasty Cuervo Gold).   I'll be back for the carnitas and the view, both of which are very memorable and as good as you can get in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food was the best I've had in as long as I can remember.  Probably the best chicken I've had in a restaurant in recent memory.  The service was also amazing.  The server was young, yes - but I don't see why that mattered to anyone else, especially when that's probably where we all started our first jobs - but age had no difference.  Our server went out of his way to provide great service, keep us happy and even had a great sense of humor. I was extremely impressed with him and wish more kids his age showed the work ethic and courtesy he did.  All in all, great service and great food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an inexpensive restaurant in Lorain this is a great place to go. While their food isn't anything spectacular, it definitely isn't bad either. I have yet to have a bad meal at El Arriero. I don't care how busy they are the food always comes out very quickly. Portions sizes are HUGE! They also have great Margaritas.   The restaurant is located in a huge old medieval looking castle which is situated just a few feet from the banks of Lake Erie. The best time to eat dinner here is in the late spring through the early fall. Take in a gorgeous sunset while sipping margaritas and eating Mexican on their outdoor patio.   El Arriero can get busy on the weekends, but I have never had to wait for a table.   Give them a call...they often have Mexican Mariachi bands...especially around dinnertime in the summer.   I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!! Give them a shot!!!"}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit for business, so I was excited to find this retaurant right on the lake! What a complete disappointment. Once my co-worker and I arrived, we waited in the lobby until someone figured out that they had a customer. We asked to be seated on the patio, but were informed it was not open yet. We wanted to see the lake, so we were seated in the bar. After walking through the main dining area and almost falling over because the floor is so uneven, we made it to the bar room facing the lake. I'm not sure they were expecting customers or even wanted them, as there were still chairs turned up on tables and the bar, wine jugs and beer cases all over the bar area, and even cardboard boxes on top of the upside down chairs (on the tables). As we looked out at the lake (great view), we noticed the broken glass beer bottle on the patio, patio needing some repairs, etc.    Our waiter was fine and attentive, but our food came out in less than 5 minutes,which concerned us, as it was TOO fast. The food and drinks were fine, and typical of Mexican restaurants all over. Not the best I've ever had, for sure, but decent.   We made our way back to the enterance, we passed a small courtyard, which is enclosed. It was full of litter, trash, etc. YUCK! Went to pay our bill and the young lady only charged me for half of the bill, a mistake. I caught it and had her charge for me the rest of my bill, as it was the right thing to do.   This place seriously needs a restaurant manager with experience. What a wonderful location on the lake, but it is obviously poorly run. It doesn't cost much to spruce the place up, CLEAN UP, and make it a desirable destination.  The patio is probably the only reason to go there, as you don't notice how poorly it is inside. Skip it!"}
{"text":"We sat on patio and view was nice. Server was prompt and attentive. Food is fair. Nothing horrible but nothing great either. Margarita was good and if you go during happy hour, the price is right"}
{"text":"We went for Margaritas.  No matter who owns it they make the weakest drinks.  That drink isn't cheap.  You shouldn't have to ask for an extra shot so you have some alcohol in it.  If you are going to get all those calories at least make it a decent drink.  These are the worst Margarita's in town.   They don't ask you if you want rocks or frozen they just bring you a pre-mixed frozen virgin Margarita at the cost of one with alcohol.  The key to a successful Mexican Restaurant is a good drink.  Look at Don Tequilas.  When the bar is empty you know they don't make good drinks.  Every single time I've gone, the bar is empty.  When that bar is full and the patio is full they know they are dong something right and people will come back."}
