{"text":"I've had their pizza a half-dozen times, pick up and delivery, and I like it! I'm no pizza expert, but it was good and cheap. Feta on top = yum."}
{"text":"Average Pittsburgh pizza and fried stuff pile, nothing special though. Gyro is good. Fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side."}
{"text":"After a night of imbibing, we required pizza for breakfast. On a Sunday, to be delivered to our house. We decided to try Calabria's, and ordered pepperoni pizza, an italian hoagie, and a side of \"hot pepper cheese balls\". 
    The pizza was horrible- so bad I couldn't eat it, and believe me that NEVER happens. It had a weird odor, the cheese was like plastic, the sauce closer to ketchup. Their pepperoni was more like capicola, huge thin slices that were dry and tasteless.
     But the hoagie was pretty good. You know, standard italian hoagie. It wasn't soggy which was surprising, so I'd definitely order a hoagie from here again. 
     I did not try the cheese balls; they were small, fried, orange spheres. Apparently though they were a bit under cooked."}
