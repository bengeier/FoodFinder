{"text":"Came here for lunch today and ordered the chicken avocado panini. Once I got back to my desk to eat, I noticed they put honey mustard on the sandwich when I requested them to put ranch instead. I also noticed the chicken didn't really look cooked, but tried to get through half of it b/c I didn't think they would really serve raw chicken. The 2nd half of the sandwich was too undercooked and I had to take it back. While there, the girl who was helping me was super nice and apologetic. But then the cook came out with an attitude and said, I just want to let you know that there is no way the chicken is raw because it comes to us precooked and frozen, we just heat it up. I don't really care where it came from or what was supposedly done to it before, but it did not look done and I don't think anyone would want chicken that looked like that. If the cook would have just stayed in the back with his bad attitude, I wouldn't be writing this, but this is not how you treat your customers."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Tucked away in courtyard in front of Hearst tower on Tryon st. Coffee is good. But the baked items are excellent. The ham and Swiss breakfast croissant is very delicious. I will return and sample their meat pies. Menu has a lot of good options - go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid coffee and espresso offering here and generally pretty consistent. Their hot drinks are right up there with the best of em and definitely could make this your go to uptown spot (complete with loyalty punch card).  Pro tip- seating inside is comfortable for small groups or couples with tables and high tops  2Â¢ - cold brew coffee is lacking"}
