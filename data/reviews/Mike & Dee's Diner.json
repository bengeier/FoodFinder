{"text":"Cute and clean diner with quick service and affordable. Potato pancakes were really good. A bit hard to find, it is located inside the PNC building. A great little spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Not great....although to be fair this might be partially because I'm comparing it to the great restaurant that was here before them.   Biggest complaint was the potatoes that came with our breakfast: basically like leftover mashed potatoes that someone burned on a hot pan for a bit but left the inside room temperature. Not like any hash browns I've ever had. Also, our eggs were not cooked over easy like we asked. Instead they were fried all the way through."}
{"text":"Great little no-nonsense spot for breakfast in downtown Cleveland. We had three breakfasts for less than the cost of a single breakfast buffet order at our nearby business hotel. Somewhat hidden - you can't see it from the street - go in the entrance for the Holiday Inn Express and go past the checkout desk."}
{"text":"Real deal diner.  Great food fast inside the Holiday Inn.  Fast service fair prices enjoy!"}
{"text":"Holy cow...looking for an omelett in Cleveland?? Stop and go to Mike & Dee's. I had the make your own (ham, jack and spinach) and Hubby had the Western (served with potatoes and toast for maybe $8?!)....both were huge, filled with toppings and cooked perfectly. Oh and while they were cooking my coffee was never empty. It's small and tight and so worth every second you spend there...."}
{"text":"What a wonderful diner!! Great food and very friendly people and the service was fast and friendly.  We are in for the weekend and found this diner on Yelp!! I would recommend this place.  We both had a great breakfast.  I had the pancakes and eggs and he had eggs over easy. A #1 and a # 2! Great food. Great staff.  Great service."}
{"text":"Giving this place four stars because there's nothing that really stood out. I reserve that fifth star for places with a bit more charm than this. The food was good, not great. Eggs over easy were a little undercooked. Toast and fruit were fine. Coffee was above average. Waitress was efficient and somewhat unhappy about life. Great location inside the Holiday Inn lobby where we were staying. Don't think I'd try anything exotic here since they couldn't quite get an egg right, but I'd eat here again if staying at the Holiday Inn."}
{"text":"Walked in on a busy morning around 8:30. Grabbed a seat at the bar. Sat there for 15 minutes and no one acknowledged me. No \"hello\", no coffee, no menu, nothing. Walked out after sitting there for so long.   I know they were busy, but maybe they should plan a little better and have more than 1 waitress on."}
{"text":"Great little diner right inside the same building the Holiday Inn is in. Food can be seen being cooked as the kitchen area is right behind the counter. I had a Western omelette with fried potatoes and wheat toast. Huge portion size. Very good and filling. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast, the omlets are very good and service was very friendly! The service was fast and the food was inexpensive especially for how much it fills you up! Would highly recommend this diner to anyone, local or visiting!"}
{"text":"Mike and Dee's provided a great breakfast and service with personality. The omelette was robust  with a nice side of potatoes and  the waitress never let my cup get low. It was a little hard to locate at first (use the Holiday Inn Express entrance), but well worth the search!"}
{"text":"Very cool diner that takes you back to the 50's inside the holiday inn. Food is cooked to order & very good.  So worth the walk if your are staying downtown & don't want the overpriced hotel breakfasts or the complimentary buffet in the lobby that is offered by some.  Too bad they are closed on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp. Great and quick service. Mike made breakfast! Kept our coffee cup filled.  Great place for a quick bite and friendly service. Tiny place so don't take more than 20 people."}
{"text":"Pretty darn cheap and decent food. I had their special breakfast and an order of french toast with coffee, and it was pretty good. They have wifi as well!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Mike and Dee's with all the great Yelp reviews.  We had looked for it on a prior visit to Cleveland but missed that it was hidden inside the PNC bank building past the \"desk\" for the Holiday Inn Express.  It is a small place and was packed when we arrived.  Unfortunately, that meant the very small kitchen was very back up so we waited for a very long time for our food.  The waitress was very apologetic but it really was too long.  My husband said his omelet was really good but my potato pancakes were uncooked and not very good, perhaps because they were rushing to get our food out the door.  Given all the good reviews, I'd give them another try if we are in the area but this visit was disappointing."}
{"text":"Solid diner breakfast food. Enter the hotel lobby and pass the desk. The low carb (3 eggs and meat) was a great option and the fruit cup was better than most with fresh blueberries, grapes, and pineapple. The Hungry mans croissant sandwich looked good and disappeared pretty quickly. All said, a respectable breakfast"}
{"text":"For the price this is the spot!  I had the corned beef hash and breakfast burrito. Both were piping hot and I watched each dish being cooked in their very clean kitchen. Service was quick and friendly. My coffee cup was always full.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!  Stumbled upon this looking for a great and quick burger, but what i found was so much more.It took place of the old sammy's grill which is right by the holiday inn express  The inside is a groovy vibe, retro feel, definetly old style dinerish ( not a word forgive me mama).  i had some wing dings, because i am a wing fanatic, and they were awesome. perfectly fried, got the dry cajun seasoning and i was in heaven with my side of chipotle ranch.  I know i said i came in for a burger, but i actually ended up getting the Cali Quesadilla with its carmelized onions and bbq sauce, again the side of chipotle ranch was the cherry on sundae.  Service was fantastic, so nice and fast, friendly. The atmosphere was calm, and inviting, the food was delicious, i literally dont have one complaint about this spot.  its going to be my new go to place for sure, the menu had a nice pick 2 section which i will dive into next visit.  to the owners: keep up the awesome work!!!"}
{"text":"Great big breakfast with the best buttermilk pan cakes ever!  Lots of food. Will definately  come back !"}
{"text":"My trainer introduced me to this place one day after a workout and I'd be lying if I said I didn't come here once a week for breakfast. I'm so obsessed with their breakfast that I haven't given myself a chance to try anything else on their menu. It's delicious and I leave nothing on that plate. Love everything about it.   It's a small hidden gem inside of the holiday inn entrance. Everyone that works here is friendly and after a few times they remember you and chat.   Prices are as low as they can keep them!"}
{"text":"Great food and value at this hidden gem. Had the daily special for lunch (homemade chicken nuggets) and it was  the best dish I've had there yet. My company uses them for catering as well, and always a good meal. Mac & Cheese and soups are also great!"}
{"text":"This is the the best diner EVER!!!  Love their low carb breakfast. Made my choice very easy and stayed within my calorie count. So tasty."}
{"text":"Service: The waitress came right up to us and took our dink orders. We had a couple of questions about things on the menu, she was very knowledgeable of the items on the menu. She also made sure she stayed engaged with us even though she had about 6 other tables.  Food: I had the #2 the eggs and sausage were very good. I got the egg whites and sausage patty. The pancake was good, but it should come with 2 cups of syrup instead of 1 cup. My dad got the western omelette. He said it was good, but he had more eggs than veggies. He would have preferred a even ratio. Atmosphere: It has a Waffle House atmosphere. Let me say this, I have no problem with Waffle House. Open range cooking with high top bar around the kitchen. There is also table seating. It is located inside of the Holiday Inn Express."}
{"text":"The food was good but they were out of pancakes and didn't make any more batter so we had to change our order. Disappointed that they didn't go above and beyond to please the customers. The waitress and cook were apologetic. For a quick and less expensive diner feel breakfast, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place. I was just surprised to get there and find a regular greasy diner. It got so much praise here on yelp that I felt this had to be a place to stop while visiting Cleveland.  It's a small cute place. The menu has the same stables you would get at any diner. Omelette was good but my potatoes were too salty to eat."}
{"text":"Always looking for breakfast diners and Mike & Dee's was a great find.  Excellent service, good food & reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I didn't go to the restaurant, just ordered some breakfast to go. Originally, we were trying to get just a handful of sandwiches but ended up getting about 20 for the entire wedding party. Despite the large number and no lead time, Mike & Dee's was able to accommodate us and in a very expedient manner. I was pretty starving but regardless, I ate TWO breakfast sandwiches (eggs, cheese, sausage, and a whole lot of butter) and they were delicious. I liked the one on wheat bread better than white as I thought it was chewier and felt more substantial. I didn't personally eat the pancakes but several of the people who did expressed their satisfaction with it. They added enough napkins and utensils (which is surprisingly something a lot of restaurants forget, weird) and maple syrup for everyone to enjoy their meals. Overall, very pleased."}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I ate here for breakfast. My son had pancakes, husband French toast, and I had the omelet. Everything was delicious. Portions are on the larger size. Restaurant small, but there was plenty of seats open. They have a bar area and tables of 4. The restaurant is actually in the holiday inn hotel. Great service and great food. Staff was attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great addition to Downtown for lunch. Our office orders catering from Mike and Dee before they opened their Diner, and thrilled that we can now get their food all the time.  I am only giving the Diner 3 stars due to the lack of service, lack of air circulation, and messed up my order and took forever to get my food back.  In regards to food: I ordered the Buffalo Chicken wrap with a side of pasta salad. My food came with french fires instead of the pasta salad and it took them 10 minutes to fix it, instead of just leaving my sandwich and giving me a side of pasta salad , which was not worth it. It definitely seems to be homemade, but too oily for me.  Other's ordered, and I tried: Dee's Veggie Quesadilla = Outstanding, Best thing I tried! Regular Quesadilla= Delicious! Patty Melt= Pretty tasty, definitely would order. Roast Beef Sandwich= kinda plain and dull. Fries= HIGHLY Recommend ordering especially with a side of their Ranch dressing. Milk Shake= YUMMY!   I highly recommend giving this place a try and if you ever are looking for catering needs, they are Excellent at it!   Lastly- they do offer Breakfast that you can also order at Lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a great new diner in Cleveland and I was delighted to be among the first customers during a visit to the city recently. Mary and I visited for lunch, and were delighted with all aspects of the visit. Her grilled cheese and my turkey sandwich were both excellent, the service provided by the staff was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was welcoming too. After the meal, we had a cookie, which we were delighted to find was freshly baked and tasted astounding. Really good!  Prices are good too, so paying the check rounded out an overall excellent experience. Definitely try this place for breakfast or lunch if you're in downtown Cleveland. The only negative is it's reasonably difficult to find- it's inside an arcade and not extremely well signposted so it appears as if one is actually walking into a hotel. On pointing this out, a staff member assured me a sign had been ordered so this may no longer even apply!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, security guard in our building didn't hesitate to suggest Mike & Dee's when we asked about best hamburger around.  Service was good and friendly for busy lunch time while food was hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic service. This place is a hidden gem. Definitely go for the corned beef and eggs with potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Exploring Cleveland for the first time we wanted to start our day with a hearty breakfast.  We found Mike and Dees hidden in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express.   The coffee was fresh and hot. The corned beef hash, delicious and hearty. The eggs were cooked exactly to order.  We were shocked to be the only customers when we arrived, but we were soon joined by a host of regulars.    This hidden gem should garner more attention."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem in the Holiday Inn Express! I live nearby and still haven't been to Mike and Dee's so my boyfriend and I finally decided we needed to stop in. If the Yelp rating/reviews weren't enough to tell you this place is great you can always walk by during lunchtime because it is packed!   The food is your typical diner food cooked to perfection. I had an omelet while my boyfriend got the corned beef. Both portions were more than satisfying for the price and delicious. Just what we were craving!   Finally, the staff is super friendly and makes you feel welcome whether you're a regular or brand new customers like us. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast joint in downtown Cleveland. Located in the Holiday Inn. I'm always on a quest for good pancakes (not Bisquick type) and this place did not disappoint. They filled the plate and were nice and hot. A side of sausage patties was the perfect companion.  Coffee was good and service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This feels like a hotel restaurant, plus the local office people making the 12-1 lunch rush.  It's NOT a \"hole in the wall omg the food is so good its worth the diner name\" There is poor signage from the street entrance, but the location is right past the Holiday Inn Express check-in desk in the PNC building.  The restaurant itself is smaller than the standard waffle house with tables of 4 packed in tight, with the smell of grease hanging in the air.  The price is on the cheaper end and the service is decently friendly and fast. The menu is pretty limited so I went with the Buffalo chicken wrap with fries and I was a tad disappointed in the lack of crispy fries and the presence of a watery buffalo sauce instead of a creamy one. That area of Cleveland has so many great food options (though they may be a little slower and a few dollars more) that I doubt I'll make a return trip for lunch."}
{"text":"Simple old school diner. Solid basic breakfast menu. Had the breakfast burrito with fruit. Delicious. Filled me up. $8 our the door. Can't beat it for downtown joint this good and that price point."}
{"text":"We walked 15 minutes to find this place and it was closed the entire Memorial Day weekend. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast sandwich (egg, cheese, sausage on a bagel) and it was great. Got it to compare to the same sandwich I always got at Sammy's and it was just as good if not better."}
{"text":"We were looking for a local joint and stumbled across this place. I had a burger and fries - it was a tasty burger. :)."}
{"text":"Good diner food! Good service...not the most amazing breakfast I've had if you're looking for a nicer relaxed sit down environment. It was a decent Diner experience though."}
{"text":"Cheap food, kind people, no nonsense. Tucked inside the Holiday Inn/PNC building as others have said."}
{"text":"This small diner located in the arcade of the building of The Holiday Inn is a great stop for visitors to Cleveland.  The waitress was so welcoming and was great to chat with.  The breakfast menu is great."}
{"text":"This new diner, from the owners of the old Alvies, is in the old Sammy's Grill location in the PNC building. It has brought back everything that my friends and I missed about the old Alvies on Ontario: friendly and fast service, casual atmosphere, and delicious food.   This is the place to go if you are looking to eat your feelings."}
{"text":"First time here. Another one of those downtown places where if you blink you'll walk right past it.   First let me say, if you don't know, I love diners. My favorite are the 24/7 ones. This is not one of them. Oh well.   So I give 5 stars because they do what diners are suppose to do. Breakfast all day, really good food, and fast fast service. Walk in to walk out time about around 30 minutes.   Love the chili (awesome!). I got the build you're own burger, it was fantastic. The condiments (lettuce, tomato, big pickle) were over sized (good thing) and the patty was light and had good flavor.   I look forward to trying some breakfast."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and it is well worth the accolades! Amazing Reuben and patty melt...real fresh tasting beef. Great personal service...we may come back for breakfast in a few days"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this gem tucked away in the Holiday Inn Express. It's like walking back in time to a 50's diner. We were greeted right away and told to pick a table. The waitress was very friendly and told us about the homemade corned beef hash and potato pancakes. We all ordered something different from a mushroom and cheese omelette to pancakes to eggs perfectly cooked with a side of amazing corned beef hash. We also had to indulge in a side of potato pancakes to share and were not disappointed. The experience exceeded my expectations, and we would hands down visit this quaint little diner if our travels brings us to Cleveland again. The prices were very reasonable and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today and wow!  Super friendly staff, very clean fun atmosphere, and delicious homemade food. The perfect little diner with all the options you'd expect, but so so tasty. I had the rosemary chicken club with fries and it was awesome. The matzo ball soup was also hot, fresh, and very homemade tasting. Can't wait to return for breakfast or a milkshake! A hidden gem serving all the best comfort foods. I'll definitely be here in the winter for matzo ball soup!"}
{"text":"This diner is cool. When you walk in, it has a very retro vibe and the colors make the diner pop. The staff are super friendly including the owners Mike and Dee Dee. The food is really good and I feel like the pricing of it is worth it."}
