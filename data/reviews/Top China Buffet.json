{"text":"All you can eat!!!! Omg I'm in heaven!! I'm starving so def not gonna go somewhere else and wait 40 mins!! so this place is amazing and fast! So happy!! Esp this time every still look great!! Well there's two dishes wasn't fresh but the lady said we can make fresh out. They didn't have to do that but so nice and kind of them. The staff also told me it's newly renovated. Too bad they they don't serve alcohol or delivery but hey that won't stop me coming back!"}
{"text":"I sometimes slip in here during the lunch hour for take out buffet.  I usually have no complaints, it's just your standard chinese buffet, but I was in there a few days ago and the food I got (which is usually what I always get) was very bland and lacking seasoning.  I always get the chicken in the white sauce, but the sauce was like water and there was no flavor.  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.  By the way, I hate China Lobster across the street."}
{"text":"This place is very good. I stopped in here occasionally for lunch it's only $5 for lunch roughly.  this place is clean the staff is always friendly and the food is always the food is always good always variety of food from chicken wings to pizza to Chinese food"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place stays in business with the superior China lobster in all facets,  just across the street. The food on the buffet is one color and just looks bad compared to China lobster and in many cases looks unappetizing,  the service was not friendly at all and dirty,  dirty dirty... I mean dirty is an understatement.  Sticky nasty tables that were leaning and broken,  and just Overall dirty.  Also a friend who works for the power company had a glimpse of their kitchen and said he couldn't believe the filth, absolutely atrocious he said.   Once again I say I have no idea how with China Lobster right across the street it stays open."}
{"text":"We eat here several times a year.  They recently remodeled and it looks great. Always clean. The food on the buffet is always hot and we'll stocked. The service is awesome. The servers are always on top of your needs. Good food, fair price."}
{"text":"I was actually looking for a different place and stumbled on this one. The prices looked reasonable, so we decided to try it out. The food was good, and the selection was pretty good. It was a good value for the price.  Positives: Service was fast, items were restocked fairly quickly and used plates were removed promptly.  Negatives: Although staff attended to things efficiently, they seemed indifferent to the guests. I saw no personality coming through, no smiles or real greeting.   Food quality was good, although the won tons in the soup were mushy and tasteless after sitting in the broth for what must have been a long time. The peel and eat shrimp were soggy and tasteless, and were complete. It took a while to not only peel them, but to then clean the top portion, which in most places, has already been removed. It didn't seem worth the effort to make them fit for consumption. The variety of shrimp and chicken in other dishes, sushi, rice, and salad items were much better.   I would go back, just to make sure it wasn't a one time thing with the few poor items."}
