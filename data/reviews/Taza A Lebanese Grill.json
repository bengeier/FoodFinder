{"text":"Upon walking in, the ambiance immediately struck me as classy and definitely middle eastern. They had these cute drapes of fabric that looked like tents and ornate metalwork divided the restaurant.

The menu was nicely laid out and easy to browse -- lots of good options with thorough descriptions. They have lots of options for vegetarians, vegans, and meat-lovers too... very diverse with reasonable prices. Everything we ordered came out very nicely presented and the meal came with bowls of warm, homemade pita bread and olive oil with sesame seeds.

My parents and I got the Vegetarian Feast, an appetizer option with tabouli, falafel, hummus, and baba all for just $16! It was very large and very good! We also got the Shawarma appetizer for $9 which was very good too. 

After that we were full and could not get anything else despite other tantalizing options. Overall, a wonderful dining experience with good flavors and spices!

Our waiter, Abby, was nice and helped explain some of the ethnic foods. However, towards the end of the meal, we had to wait pretty long for her to check on us and give us the check."}
{"text":"The service in this place is deplorable. I walked in on a Saturday evening, sat myself at the bar and waited for 15 minutes. The place was dead, but nobody greeted me. I sat there for 15 minutes then walked out, all without one person greeting me. Will never come back, they were dead, I came in to give them money, and they wouldn't even come get it."}
{"text":"While on the business trip my boss recommened to check out Taza knowing that I love Middle Eastern food.  Of course I didn't just take his word for it.  Looked at yelp reviews and they were good for the most part so I decided to give it a try.  

Let me just say that if know real Middle Eastern food you will never give this place more than 2 stars. Everything, from meat to rice, to falafel was spiced incorrectly.  My kefta tasted like hamburger meat.  The gross, over the top white garlic sause taste lingered in my mouth for a full 24 hours no matter how many times I brushed my teeth.  In fact, the chef here seems to favor garlic quite a bit.  

Middle Eastern food is about simplicity and fresh ingridients, preservation of flavor while it's made that's why it's important not to overccok the meat or vegetables.  In this place even vegetables tasted bad.  How do you screw up that.  

Anyway, bad bad...  If you care for your palate, do not eat there!"}
{"text":"Stop at Taza was the highlight of a recent visit to Cleveland.  Nice accessible location, great food, friendly service.  Only down side was the wine list was a little mixed up, but we got through it OK."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant the other day. I ordered two mixed drill and a chicken shawarma plate.The food was bland and lacked seasoning. The meat was dry and did not taste good. The shawarma was literally grilled chicken tenderloins which is what shawarma really is. The food tasted as if it was Americanized and didn't resemble the Mediterranean taste it should have. Overall I was not satisfied with place and the food was very overpriced for the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience - in and out in under an hour.  I had the hummos shwarma and it was perfect.  Our server Claire was very friendly and efficient.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really wish YELP would implement half stars. I'm giving Taza 3 stars only because of their hummus and tabouli. You could split this with someone and leave with a full stomach for a great price or even order it for take out. But then again if you're going to do that you should just go to Aladdin's bakery down the street and get the best hummus you've ever had for 1/3 of the price. The entrees are what really brings this place down. It is not cheap by any means yet the portion sizes are tiny. This restaurant is not terrible but I doubt I will ever go back despite living down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent. If you enjoy good Lebanese food, not Middle Eastern -  simply sit down and let them serve you. The food is prep is just delicious.

The atmosphere is just right whether it be family, friends or with a date.

I could ramble on but this says it all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very beautiful and the food is quite tasty as well. I got the falafel hummus wrap which was delicious and my husband got the lamb roll and he said it was very good. We went on Sunday before the Browns game and we were the only ones in the place. I was surprised that people would rather eat nasty greasy burgers and shitty bar food than give this place a shot. I only wish they had chili or lentil soup or even len-chili like aladdins does."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the evening. Spent a good evening with friends and food added on the top. We tried couple of items including hummus, falafel. Pita bread were simply fresh and soft. 

Service given by Claire was good and definitely calls for a second visit"}
{"text":"Great place and good service! Will be back again when we visit Cleveland again! Thanks to the great staff!"}
{"text":"The food was simply amazing! And the waitress was so nice and really helpful with describing some of the dishes. I just wish it was in Pittsburgh so we could eat there more often."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting for work in Cleveland form middle east. I had been here couple of times and loved the food so I took him there.. and he absolutely loved it. We tried almost 4-5 appetizers and all of them were good. My favorite been the Falafel. Atmosphere is really good and the service is top notch. Highly recommend to any food lover."}
{"text":"Ok I'm from Amish country so we are noodles and mashed potatoes raised.  Eating Lebanese is so out of the box, but take my word for it this is great food!!  If I could grill like this I would grill every day at home.  We had the mixed grill and it was great.  We started with manakish and finished with baklava!  I would eat here again in a heart beat.!"}
{"text":"Best I have found outside of my family's kitchen!

I married into a Lebanese family not too long ago and when I am on the road, I look for a little taste of home to stave off the homesick.  

This place rocks!  When I sit down, the first thing I ask is if they serve kibbeh nay eh (raw ground sirloin with bulgur wheat).  If they have it I know someone in the kitchen has some skills and is true to the culture by offering it on the menu.  

I was in town with 2 colleagues in tow.  Neither had experienced Lebanese food, and I was excited to introduce it to them.  I ordered the kibbeh nay eh, one ordered the chicken/beef kabobs, and the other ordered a chicken dish.  Everything was served fresh and piping hot.  The Arabic bread was fresh out of the oven and smelled divine. My kibbeh was amazing.  And true to tradition, I had it with raw onion and Arak to wash it down.  My colleagues raved about their dishes; They were curious about mine and even tried a little.  While they were a bit hesitant at first, they both agreed it was awesome.  

The service was top-notch and we really enjoyed the decor.  If I ever have a reason to come back to Cleveland, I will make the trip back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Not a very significant difference between small and large size dishes. I ordered small, my friend ordered large, we were both feeling pretty full by the time we were done eating."}
{"text":"It's been a year that Taza has been open downtown and I have to say that everything just keeps getting better.

I've tried at least 2/3 of the items on the menu and found every one to be outstanding. I'm not exaggerating... they really know how to cook here.  From the hostess/host who greets you at the door to the servers at the table, service has been impeccable. The only complaint (and a minor one at that), is when the lunch rush arrives, the kitchen can be a little slow.  But the quality of the food and attentiveness of the staff more than make up for it.

I highly recommend Taza if you're looking for food that's fresh & healthy, and service second to none.

(And say hi to Kixi if you stop by at lunch -- she's a blast!)"}
{"text":"Great food, the baba ganoush is delicious. The lentil dish also was very good. A bit pricy as most of downtown can be, but very good food"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner at Taza, and everything was exceptional. Sargon (spelling), the manager in charge of events was extremely attentive. He put up with both parental units and 100s of questions. He was patient and helped us choose a menu (food and beverage) that suited our guests (read:budget). They seemed happy to accommodate every request we had, no matter how bizarre. The event itself was flawless from start to end. The bar tenders did an amazing job keeping everyone drunk. The food was excellent and plentiful. Many guests of middle eastern decent, who's names have been redacted for safety purposes, stated the kafta (ground lamb kebabs) was better than their mothers' kafta. The restaurant had no problem making some room for people that wanted to dance after having a few drinks. We did not feel rushed to end the dinner at a particular hour, which we truly appreciated. Since the prices here are reasonable, we were able to close out the restaurant and not have to share the space. I could not recommend this place enough for rehearsal dinners."}
{"text":"In town for the day, Lebanese sounded great. 

The chicken schwarma was served fresh and hot. Very good. Fries seasoned just right. 

Only suggestion I would have.....I would have loved some hummus and tabbouleh to start. But, they only had the $7-8 dinner appetizer portions. Not appropriate for a guy dining by himself without the ability to take home leftovers. 

Very good!!!"}
{"text":"The food was served in a timely fashion and was absolutely delicious.  The prices didn't quite fit the portion size but they are on w.6th so within reason. I definitely recommend and will return.  I had the vegetarian meal with a side if rice.  My only down side was that all of our drinks ( I was there for a bday party and had one if their specialty teas) were watery.  I love flavored water so I was fine with it but if I order tea or anything besides water I expect just that.  Next time I will only order water. I don't go to places like this for the drinks though.  It's all about the food."}
{"text":"Excellent service, vegetarian options, and portion sizes. This is a great value for the quality and price in the downtown area. For a late night dinner w/ wine, I was please w/vegetarian feast and other veggie options. Honestly, this Mediterranean place stands up to quality and value on either coast. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way through Cleveland. Split the Vegetarian Feast and had the lentil soup too. The Feast was perfect to split with one other person. Couldn't get enough of the babaganoush, hummus, falafel, & taboulli with the steaming hot pita! Fresh flavors in the Feast and the delicious lentil soup left me very satisfied. 

Good view of the city, as the neighboring block is a ground level parking lot. Service was slightly slow, but fit well with the laid back ambiance. Allowed us to relax and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, best Mediterranean I've had in decades. Staff were lovely and personable. Great option for vegans/vegetarians"}
{"text":"Nice meal, enjoyed salad and grilled veg meals, garlic aioli intense, make sure to get if and only if you really like garlic! Hot fresh pita, great service. Swarma roll spicing very different from gyro; a little tough and mostly just lemony. We recommend."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and super decor. Food was exceptionally good...lebanese cuisine is very similar to turkish, both of which sorry to say, are more interesting than greek. Good thing the santorini restaurant behind it was closed else I would have gone there."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Wonderful atmosphere. The loubie and kibbee naja are my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Iwas at their other location in Beachwood about 6 months ago, so this time I was in Cleveland I went out of my way to try the downtown location.  It was just like I wanted it to be.  Start with a nice drink and some olives, then casually pick a (very affordable) entree.  I had a shawarma and it was great.  The do nice falafel too.  And last but not least the free bread and oil is tasty and a nice free way to start.  I only wish my wife was with me, since I couldn't finish my dinner."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, service is top notch, and the food is phenomenal! I'm in town often for work and this one is on my short list of must eats!"}
{"text":"We visited this location on New Years Eve with another couple.  The location is great for a night out on the town.  You can walk easily back to the Eest 4th area, or stay on 6th street if you are looking to fist pump.

I have been to the location in Eton twice and since I live downtown we thought to give this a try.  The decor on the inside is very cool and I love the open kitchen.  It is always nice to see what is going on back there.  The great thing about Taza is you can get a wonderful meal and it doesn't break the bank.   

I don't know how to spell half the stuff on their menu, so I will just explain what I had.  For an appetizer we ordered a large portion of different humus's, pita, fried faffel, and other stuff.  Great!  For my dinner I had the rolled chicken schwarma? Spelling.  Anyways it was cooked perfectly.

The had a good selection of beer and even had a belly dance show.  Pretty Cool!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this 5 stars,  the food was great,  but the service was really really bad.  20 minutes before we got heated by a server,  apps coming out one at a time over the course of a half hour.  1-1/2 hours for a quick business lunch was to much.  Seems life the people who say outside got faster service.  Noticed the old man up at the hot page seemed a little confused at times with handing the orders of the the waitresses.  I think he may have been helping to slow things down by micromanaging.  Maybe it's time to let go and let your people do their jobs."}
{"text":"It was 8 PM on a Friday night and the place was empty, and I got turned away at the door with NO explanation - just that \"they weren't serving\" even though there were patrons there."}
{"text":"Taza is a wonderfully adorned restaurant in downtown Cleveland, and has, as our server said, \"big portions.\" I went with a friend and both of us left with boxes.

Having read some other reviews for the restaurant, I had some trepidation about going but ultimately decided that the idea of trying a new world cuisine was too enticing to be put off by an angry manager. Fortunately, my experience was incredibly pleasant; the manager was actually quite nice, and even popped outside when she noticed my friend calling me as I stood outside. The two of us were also there for about an hour and a half, and neither the manager nor the waitress asked us to leave (though Christmas eve is surely not their busiest day).

The service was excellent; our waitress took a moment to make some suggestions and give us a run-down on Lebanese cuisine. We both ordered pita wraps, which came with fries, and everything was delightful; the seasoning on the fries was terrific, and the wraps themselves were scrumptious. The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful, well-accompanied by the tahani dressing and vegetables that were rolled in with it.

To top everything off, our waitress was an absolute peach and gave us both some small pieces of baklava to cap off our experience of Lebanese food. The prices are reasonable, at $8.75 for the most expensive wrap and $12 or so for a dinner platter if I remember correctly. They have a full bar and a sizable wine list (not so for the beer, but then again if you want beer there are better places to visit in Cleveland), and the prices are, again, reasonable. Without a doubt, I'd recommend this place to friends and would visit again should the opportunity arise."}
{"text":"Love Taza!  I live really close to the restaurant and am a frequent customer.  The service is always great and the menu choices are delicious.  Love the Shawarma plate, hummus, salads, and pits wraps.  Everything I've had has been amazing, the location is nice and the outside seating is my favorite.  Would recommend to everyone that enjoys Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that I love Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean food and being from New York, have it all the time, so honestly when my daughter recommended going to a Lebonese restaurant in Cleveland I really did not expect to have the best Middle Easterern I've ever tried!!! EVERYTHING we tried was so fravorfull and delicious! It was like a party of tastes in my mouth! Can't wait to visit Cleveland and Taza again!!! 
As I mentioned to the manager last night, would LOVE IT if they opened one of these in the New York area!! I'm sure it would make a killing!!!"}
{"text":"It's always a great place to choose. I love their Hummus and their Kibbie is the best, too. Service is always amazing! Don't forget to check in here in order to get a free coffee and Baklava."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Brooklyn and was missing my local Lebanese place, so I had to come here. Taza is a nice relief from the dozens of bar/restaurants in the area. It was short walk from the Key Center and I'm lucky I wandered over here - not too many people seemed to know about it. The staff was welcoming and attentive, the decor charming, and the music cheerful. I had a specialty salad with marinated chicken and olives and on the side some fried cheese with a pomegranate sauce - quite a delicious lunch. I wish I lived in the area so that I could try more of the menu! If I find my way back to Cleveland, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been to Taza many times over the years and have yet to be disappointed in anything I have ordered. I could wax poetic about the food, but you need to come and try it for yourself. There are options for vegetarians, vegans, etc.

Our server Janette was kind, courteous, and helpful. She was sweet and fun - and even drew butterflies on our dessert plates with chocolate. We never had to wish for a refill because she was on it before we had to ask. 

Although it was a busy lunch time, I was in and out of this visit in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Always good. Great lebanese food. Service is excellent. One of our favorite downtown cle spots."}
{"text":"We decided to try Taza for dinner tonight while visiting Cleveland, Ohio.

We were greeted and seated fairly quickly, and our server was by pretty fast to check on.  He took our drink order and left us with the menus for a bit.  The Lebanese beer (Almaza?) was nice.

I started with hummus and Fattoush salad.  The hummus, to me, tasted like it came from a can and was quite bland (which seemed to be the theme for the evening)- needed more lemon, garlic, and tahini!  The Fattoush was quite nice, tangy, could have used a bit of salt, but there was none on the table.

Before I even had an opportunity to finish my appetizer (the salad), the meal came out.  This REALLY bugs me.  It's simply a matter of attention to detail.  Don't fire the entree WITH the appetizer.

I ordered the small size Shish Tawouk which came with vegetables, Lebanese rice, and garlic sauce.  The chicken itself wasn't bad, but the vegetables didn't taste like vegetables - they were overpowered by whatever spice they used on them which sometimes clash with the flavour of the vegetables.  Lebanese rice to me is rice with vermicelli, which is what came out...only they sprinkled cinnamon on the rice.  Unfortunately, this wasn't itemized on their menu.  The cinnamon just did not work....at all!  

It took a while for the waiter to check up on us, but when he finally did, I mentioned that the food was pretty bland and that the cinnamon was just not working and that we weren't really enjoying the meal.  He apologized and offered to bring some plain rice on the side, which 3/4 into our dinner was pretty much pointless.  When we finished, he actually asked if we wanted anything boxed up.  Hello??? What part of we didn't enjoy our meal did you not get?  

What infuriated me the most was that no manager was sent to the table, no further conversation about the food happened.  

Very disappointed with not just the food, but the service as well.

We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Oh my! Went to dinner here last night! Out of this world, had a great patio seating area that was extremely classy not picnicy like many other patios you'll find at restaurants. Wine menu was wonderful and served at just the perfect temp! Staff was very helpful with menu items and super attentive! Had the raw kibbee! It was interesting but good. The beef shrawma could not have been better. Will go back very very soon."}
{"text":"Service was disappointing. My plate arrived 20 minutes after everyone else's-we were a group of 13.  Experience was less than desirable. Time with friends saved the evening."}
{"text":"I have been to the location downtown several times. Great food, service & atmosphere. I never have to wait to be seated, the service is flawless, the food is seasoned well, at least to my liking. I love the lentil soup, grape leaves & their baba."}
{"text":"Delicious food and beautiful outdoor seating area. Server Janette is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food and warm and friendly staff! Food was very tasty! Environment was nice and had great outdoor setting and was relaxing."}
{"text":"Fantastic Lebanese food! The restaurant is very classy.  Ask for an awesome server named Claire. I highly recommend getting dome baba ganoush, tabouli, hommus for starters, then if you like trying a bit of everything try the Mixed grill I and finish it off with turkish coffee and baklava!  Fantastic time."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced with a more manageable menu than its counterpart Aladdin's, and way delicious.

Whenever I go to Taza I get an order of baba ganouj. Their baba is really really wonderful. It was the inspiration for me to try to make my own. Mine has never been as good as their tangy, savory, salty glorious mashed eggplant.

You always get zatar - a dark sesame seed oil mixture to dip pita in. They bring out both regular flat pita and puffy bread. I still don't know the name of the puffy bread, multiple servers have insisted that it's really the same as the pita bread, but that is not possible, it's mildly sweet and amazing whereas the pita is just pita.

Their salads are unusually substantial and great. I like the Phoenician, Lebanese, and Cedars salads.

They're pretty busy during lunch but slower during dinner. They have a patio."}
{"text":"Taza is a new spot, recently opened in the Warehouse district of Cleveland.  It is in the spot where Crop was located before Steve Schimoler moved it to Ohio City.  It has gotten a nice redo to give it a Middle Eastern vive.  Walls and ceiling are draped with gauzy fabrics and the lighting is softly covered with lengths of fabric and beads which give an intimate feel to it.

Taza is part of the Cleveland-based Aladdin's restaurant chain (which has locations in Chicago, Charlotte, Raleigh, Toledo, Detroit, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Arlington and San Antonio!), Taza is known for its wide variety of traditional mezza (Lebanese for 'tapas,' or appetizers).    Her twin sister is located in Woodmere.    The menu says that Taza uses no sulfites or any type of preservatives in the food and only the freshest vegetables and meats.  The freshness was apparent in the foods we were served.

I was there is week as part of a group who came on the recommendation of one of my husband's  co-workers, Tom R., who had eaten there once and said it was really good.  It turns out that \"really good\"  was a bit of an understatement.  The food rocked!

We ordered assorted  entrées and this is a review of those seated around me.  With a bit of encouragement, I took some photos which I would love to share.  

The server brought out some warm puffy pita bread with Zaatar (an ancient Middle Eastern herb) and olive oil, sprinkled with sesame seeds, for dipping which was really good.  Some of the bread was puffed and some was traditional flat pita.  I don't know if they go by different names but it was all good.  I particularly liked the warm puffs of bread which I tore and dipped into the oil.

Upon the recommendation of Tom, I ordered the \"tour of Lebanon\" which gave a nice variety of things to sample.  I was a large serving of  Shawarma (shaved beef that has been skewered and cooked for hours) with grilled onions,  Shish Tawook  (grilled chicken (marinated in a yogurt puree over couscous),  Lebanese Salata ( a mixture of chopped tomato, green pepper, cucumber, onions, olives and feta in a lemon-herb dressing),  Hummos ( a puree of chickpeas, tahini and lemon)  and Baba, short for  baba ghanoush (char-grilled eggplant with tahini and lemon).  Everything was spot on for flavors.  The serving was quite ample and I took half of it home for lunch the next day.  

My husband had the falafel which came with chopped tomatoes and onions in a lemon herb dressing along with the Shawarma plate which had rice.  He offered me a taste of the falafel, which had a crispy outer layer with a flavorful soft center.   His loved the Shawarma as did I.

Suzanne, seated next to me, had Makanek (baby sausages made with spiced beef and lamb, sautéed in a lemon-pomegranate sauce.  She offered me a taste of the sauce on some pita and it was well balanced and tasty.  She also got a salad with was huge and she took half of it to go.

We finished the meal with Baklawa (a thin, phyllo dough desert, sweetened with syrup and dusted with pistachio dust).  It had a nice buttery flavor and was not overly sweet.

Our server was great in making suggestions for us to try if we were unsure of something.  She was attentive without being annoying.

While we were eating, the owner,  Fady Chamoun, checked frequently to see that we were all pleased with our meals.  He showed us his new, soon to be finished private party room which promises to be quite lovely.  We must go back again soon"}
{"text":"Loved this place....as soon as we walked in we were greeted by the wonderful hostess and owner Claire.  We enjoyed hummus with beef on top which was excellent, spinach with garlic w spinach was average and  bread w a special oil dip was good for appetizers.  For our main courses we had shish lamb which was delicious, the specialty Taza chicken salad was A+.  The chicken kafta was also very good.   Would consider giving it 5 star  but the phonecian salad was not as described.  We would go again, the meal was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"They have the best pita bread, soft and fluffy. The vegetarian appetizer sampler is amazing! The salads are delicious too but the highlight is the falafel! I always get salads as main dishes because they sre amazing here. Good service and very nice decor."}
{"text":"We had the vegetarian feast and the manakish appetizers for lunch.  I would not recommend the zaatar manakish.  Not that it wasn't good, but it is exactly like what they bring to the table for free.  I tried one of each topping (spinach, feta, zaatar), and definitely the spinach is the way to go because it actually has both spinach and feta on it.  The vegetarian feast itself was plenty for two to split as a meal, especially because they bring unlimited breads to the table.  I think the hummos, baba, tabouli, and falafel actually all taste very, very similar to Aladdin's.  I probably prefer Aladdin's vegetarian combo because it also includes dawali, which Taza's does not.  But on the other hand, Aladdin's does not give complimentary pita and zaatar.  But no matter what you order, definitely ask for some of their outstanding hot sauce!

I've been wanting to check out Taza for a long time, and they did not disappoint.  That being said, I probably won't go out of my way to come back any time soon.  The food was good, and there were many other things on the menu I want to try, but the service was pretty slow.  There just wasn't enough positives to overcome the hassle involved with eating out downtown (traffic, parking, etc).  If I'm already downtown and looking for a place to eat, that's another story!"}
{"text":"The food was generally good, I was there Saturday evening with a group of 4.  The meat on my meal seemed over cooked and chewy. The others in our group had the beef cabin, which they loved.

The service was good."}
{"text":"We decided to go outside our comfort zone and stop here for lunch. My review is based on the fact that we have probably had true Lebanese food once or twice in our lives, and it was given to us by the Lebanese girl dating our son, so it was homemade and dessert, at that. If you aren't Lebanese, I'll try to explain what we experienced so your taste buds will be alerted. If you are, pardon me if I get any of the spices or seasonings wrong.

Firstly, \"free\" weekend parking in the area is hit or miss. We were there on a Saturday at lunch time and had to circle to actually see someone leaving within 2 blocks of the place. Good luck with that.

Secondly, when we entered, no one came to seat us. We stood in the foyer for a good 4-5 minutes waiting. It wasn't until my husband actually walked into the dining area that the waitress saw us and came over. 

We were seated pleasantly enough, and we were brought a basket of flat breads with olive oil that appeared to have a very mild black pepper as well as sesame seeds in it. I'm not a fan of olive oil. I don't do bitters very well, and olive oil sets that off for me in a very unpleasant way. The husband enjoys bitters and he was the one doing all the dipping. 

We both got unsweetened iced tea, the regular kind, though they have different flavors. No sweeteners were volunteered, so after 20 minutes or so, I had to ask.

We ordered the shawarma for an appetizer, and then I got the kebab pita and the husband got the lamb pita. 

The shawarma was different for a non-Mediterranean person. It had peppers and onions on the plate, sauteed in olive oil, but then it also had a chopped/diced meat, almost like minute steaks cut up, in olive oil and some bitter seasoning I couldn't place. It wasn't lemon, it wasn't citrus at all, but definitely very bitter. The back sides of my tongue are bothering me now as I type this in memory. The husband ate more of it than I did and seemed to like it. 

When the meals came, we had a sandwich which was grilled on the outside then cut in half, and fries with an \"ancient\" seasoning on them. I personally didn't know that French Fries existed in ancient times, nor that the Lebanese had a special seasoning for them back then, but ok. Whatever. They weren't bad. Just different. 

The husband enjoyed his sandwich, but after the first half, was full, so he disassembled it and ate the veggies he knew and the remaining lamb chunks. He wasn't a fan of the pickled turnips. I know that much.

I, on the other hand, was having a heck of a time with my kebab pita. In each side, there were 3 chunks of meat, about the size of a standard ice cub. That would have been fine except it was the toughest meat I've eaten in a long time. On top of that, it was very sinewy and hard to bite into without grabbing the entire chunk and looking extremely uncouth. So I had to hold the sandwich to my face and chew - chew - chew - chew until I could actually bite through the gristle and sinew. Again, the meat was bitter tasting, like the shawarma, and on top of the pickled turnip, some bitter greens inside and a slightly sour sauce, it was too much for me. I put the sandwich down and picked through the rest, eating small bites until it was time to go. 

The husband enjoys bitter, like I said, but by the time we were hitting the french fries, he had admitted it was enough for him in one sitting, too.

So we paid the bill and headed out. 

Now, truly, I don't know the culture very well, as the girl who was dating our son remained very removed from us for almost the 4 years they were together as she lived 1200 miles away with him, so I can't say whether it was authentic food or whether it was just restaurant food. It was good. It was fresh. It was very flavorful (especially if you enjoy the bitters) and we did enjoy what we had. The waitress and hostess (?) were very attentive once we were seated and catered to our needs very well. However, that said, I wouldn't go back. It was one of those \"did it, moving on\" type experiences for me, and didn't have enough draw there to call me back for a second time around."}
{"text":"Short Take:  Excellent, garlicky, well-executed Lebanese standards. Pita bread is served with one of my all time favorites: z'atar in olive oil. The value is excellent; these folks do not scrimp.  One dish easily serves 2 or 3 people. Suggest you stay with the appetizers, or mezzes, and order only a mixed grill to share--it's a ton of food--unless you're like us and over order and eat it for 2-3 days.  Lebanese food is meant to be eaten family style. Use your hands. Throw it all in the middle of the table, tear off pieces of bread and dip, and roll up meat and veggies and dip and eat. Repeat. Just don't double dip.

Baseline: We love garlic, lots of it; powerful, raw, sharp; cooked, mellow, lucious.  Any way it comes, we love it. Taza serves it up in all these wonderful ways.

On our first visit, we ordered the shawarma plate, the labneh (garlickly yogurt with parsely), jibneh (grilled cheese drizzled with pomegranate syrup), mixed grill platter (spiced beef kafta, chicken brochettes, and beef brochettes), foule medamas (cooked pinto and foule beans (like lima beans) with fresh lemon juice finish), babganoush (or \"baba\") (fire grilled eggplant that is smashed and seasoned as a dip), hummus, manakish--one of each z'atar, spinach, feta--Lebanese pizza, and falafel.. The mixed grill came with french fries; hot and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Bonus: the fries were sprinkled with more z'atar.  Excellent.

Each of the dishes arrived meticulosly plated and hot.  With the mixed grill, we got a little container of \"garlic.\"  It's actually a garlic mousse, which is garlic heaven.  It's sharp, raw, pungent, and crazy delicious if you love garlic as much as we do.  I make this stuff at home; some people call it garlic sauce, or aioli, or skordalia (Greek), but here our server said they just call it \"garlic.\"  I call it swoon worthy. 

They kept us supplied with warm pitas.

We liked the shawarma plate and the foule the least, but both were still good.  The shawarma was overly spiced and a bit too finely shredded.

My second visit was to pick up take out; everything was packed meticulously and was just as delicious in our hotel room.  I added soujouk (Lebanese sausages served in stewed tomato sauce) to our list for take out.  Outstanding.  So good that I ate it cold the next morning with a hot piece of pita out of the microwave.  

The 6th Street location has a beautiful backroom that is ideal for large groups."}
{"text":"Taza is a great Restaurant. I am traveling from out of town with my business partner. We decided to give Taza a try and we were impressed. Claire was our server. She treated us with much care and attention. Try the nine vegetable soup.."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Amazing food. Amazing drinks. Try the ahi tuna. The garlic spinach was awesome with the fresh pita bread. Just a great experience. The management shows they truly care."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last Saturday evening and enjoyed every bite. The baba ghanoush was really good! The tabouli salad fresh and the perfect mix of each ingredient. The service was also welcoming and just the right amount of attentive. I am new to Cleveland and am excited to frequent this lovely spot with its warm and even romantic ambiance. Must visit."}
{"text":"This spot has a great atmosphere, friendly and attentive waitstaff and light (but delicious!) Mediterranean fare.  My wife and I came in recently before heading over to CIFF for a movie.  We decided the share two dishes, so we chose a salad and an appetizer sampler platter.

Our server started us off with a basket of warm, puffy pitas served with a super-tangy dipping sauce.  These breads also came in handy for dunking into various sauces and dips later on in the meal.

The falafel salad came with four warm falafels served atop mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese and two dressings on the side (tahini and lemon herb).  It was filling and their falafels had a slight kick, were moist and were some of the best I'd ever had.

The Taste of Taza appetizer sampler was full of delicious choices... beef shawarma, shish tawook (chicken), vegetable couscous, Lebanese salad (tomato, cucumber, onion), hummus and baba ghanouj.  The shish tawook was some of the most tender chicken I've ever had, with a terrific grilled flavor.

To end the meal, we used a Yelp freebie.  Their baklava dessert was unusual, served in small \"roll\" like shapes but they were mildly sweet and very flaky.

A somewhat unexpected meal, where both my wife and I were very pleased with the dishes we chose.  Great choice for a healthy, downtown restaurant option."}
{"text":"I was wondering in the downtown area around lunch time and came across this Lebanese grill. I have noticed a lot of Mediterranean places in Cleveland and surrounding area but this one is special. 

The ambiance is very nice. They have some good work done on the ceiling with chandeliers and fake walls to give it a theme. The place is quite clean and specious. There is outdoor seating available but we preferred to sit inside. 

The appetizer, we ordered baba, was delicious and good for both of us. We decided to change our plans and order soups instead of a full entrée, we still had left overs! I am not saying the portions are huge but pretty good. Wait staff is very courteous and the owner personally checked on us. Their soups are very nice and filling. I would love to come back here at busy time and see if they are still maintaining this great service. But so far they have won at least a second visit from me. 

This is one of a kind experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Taste of Taza is a great appetizer for a group. I ordered the Chicken Tatteh. Tasted great, however far too many fried pita chips and chick peas and not enough chicken. The rest of the family loved their choices. The waitress chose not to write down our orders and gave my DH chicken instead of Shwarma. He still liked it though. Would definitely recommend and would come back!! Checked in and got a free baklava and Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"This place gets a very solid and deserved 5 stars from me. 

Taza is a middle eastern restaurant on W6th, that frankly didn't look all that impressive from the outside. However, once you stepped in, all those perceptions changed immediately. The interiors are plush and luxurious, with paneled walls and ceilings, and beautiful chandeliers. We went mid-week for dinner, and they had a live pianist playing a mix of bossa-nova jazz and classic tunes. Looking at this place I thought \"oh well, it's not every day that I splurge on a meal, so why not\". 

And then I saw the menu - $14.95 for a vege sampler? That can't be right. Must be small. So I ordered one all for myself. 
While waiting for the sampler, we were served the standard pitas (which were nice and warm) along with 2 other types of middle eastern bread (I loved the fluffy one) along with oil as well as a black sesame dip with sumac, which was mind-blowingly delicious!

And then we were served the labneh and the vege platter - and let me tell you, it was frigging huge! 4 falafels, hummus, baba, and a mountain of tabbouleh. And those falafels... Mmmmm... my mouth waters as I type! 

And the service matched the food and the ambience. Quick, knowledgable, helpful and unintrusive service. We ate in peace. When we wanted to order something, there was someone magically by our table almost instantaneously. Water glasses never ran empty. It was beautiful. 

In all seriousness - go here. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I think I was walking by just as they opened, and one of their servers dashed out the door, let me know they were open, and ushered me in. I didn't really have a choice, but I didn't mind.

The building itself is beautiful. You know the sort of lighting that cameras can't really capture? That's what they have going on here. It's just cool to look at. The servers are kind and they know what they're doing. I didn't know what to get, on account of this being my first time with Lebanese food, so the waiter talked with me a bit before we settled on tuna.

And friends, what a slab of tuna it was. I don't think I've had tuna cooked better anywhere, and I've tried since to find it. It was a little on the underseasoned side, but I think it may have just been how I was eating it -- it was served with vegetables and rice, and when you ate everything together, it was like... I hate to say something like 'a symphony of flavor' or nonsense like that -- so I'll settle with \"it was really, really good.\""}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent and friendly service and lovely atmosphere. Even our teenage son ate happily, not having a clue what he'd ordered. The baklava finger perfectly complemented the Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Cleveland never ceases to surprise me. I travel here a couple times a year for business and always find great food and lots to do. This was my first time at Taza. Got there somewhat early so not a lot of people. Ordered the Taste of Taza. They have homemade pita that is very good and serve it with a oil, vinegar and sesame seed dip. The hummus was good not great but the baba ganouj was great. Instead of shawarma I asked for double chicken and they whipped up a fantastic chicken version of how the shawarma is served to accompany the Shish Tawook. Service was very good. Added bonus if you sit outside you can feed the birds little pieces of your pita by hand. Great value, great food!"}
{"text":"Know what I love?  When you discover something new on a menu that you wouldn't think to order.  Today I ordered the Shish Tawook rolled pita which I've gotten numerous times before...but I have always subbed out the french fries.  Today I got the fries and let me tell you...move over Market Garden, these are some seriously great seasoned french fries!  Wow.  Now there's even more to love at Taza in addition to everything else on the menu.  Yummo."}
{"text":"Taza is my favorite restaurant! All the food is amazing. You have to try the Lebanese jibneh, spicy hummus, mixed grills, pita!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We love mediterranean cuisine and were quite pleased with everything that we had ordered. There was a large group of us and we shared the vegetarian and meat appetizer platters. Both were very delicious and plentiful to share amongst 8 adults.  We had great service from our waitress and she was very accommodating to the two young children that we had at our table (even providing off the menu options for a picky eater).  We will definitely be back on our next venture into Cleveland."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, one of the best middle eastern restaurants I have tried in a long time anywhere including NY, Philly and DC.  I come to Cleveland for business frequently and for the past 3 month every time I visit I can not not stop by for either eating in or taking out a meal from Taza.  By now I must have tried literally everything on their menu and there is nothing that I didn't like.There appetizers are delicious, the entrees are excellent and proportions are very generous and yet they are very reasonably priced. The icing on the cake is the extremely friendly and courteous service.  I would highly recommend Taza downtown to anyone visiting Cleveland and wants to enjoy excellent middle eastern food (their shawirma sandwich is addictive!)"}
{"text":"For sure not the best place to go. I am surprised that its rating is high on the yelp?!

The quality of food is not good at all. Besides the food is so grease.

Expensive, but the location and place are nice. We ordered two meals with a side cost us 60$ after the tax. With 60$ you definitely have better options."}
{"text":"Great food, but terrible service! I was dining alone and waiting forever for everything I asked for."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat for my birthday! Claire was a wonderful waitress and did a thorough job of explaining the menu items. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"The best thing on the menu here is the kibbe, fried one that is! The batata hara was quite disappointing, there was almost no cilantro in it and they unoriginally called it potato cilantro!I had the lamb kabob that was really dry, seemed like it had been cooked a while ago and just left sitting there! We got the soujouk to go which turned out to be quite good but this place still deserves 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food was average yet costly, it adds 20% on service and asks for tips!!!!! The Kofta was a little over spicy than it should be, the kabob was tasteless and charred while the hommos was a ready made one."}
{"text":"I have to say that I had pretty low expectations for this place - after all, a Lebanese place in the Warehouse District? I mean, two doors down is a place called the Nauti Mermaid...how good can this be?

Very good.

I've actually been here twice now, and was impressed both times. My first time, I got the Chicken Kafta - a shish kabob dish that comes with rice, veggies, and sauce - plus the breads that the servers give your table. It was delicious and actually too much food - I had to take some home to eat the next day, when it was still delicoius!

My next visit I got the Fattoush salad, which was equally yummy and well portioned. I just wished I had ordered it with chicken - after my chicken kafta being so good, I sort of longed for some of it during my second visit.

As other reviewers have said, the interior is well decorated and looks quite better than the outside. Both times I went, the place was pretty empty, but I was also on the late side of the lunch hour.

Well done Taza!"}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant with excellent service and amazing food. The falafel is the best I've ever had!  Everything we ordered was so delicious. If we are ever back in Cleveland we will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Just lucked into this place for a Monday night dinner after a 500-mile drive. Perfect! Simple and tasty middle. East dishes. The usual suspects all good: hummus, jibneh, kebabs, kafta, tahini, etc. Satisfying, pleasant meal far more interesting than the usual NY Strip or cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Great food. I recommend the falafel, even if you are a meat-eater. Cocktails were average but service was excellent"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was here so I can't remember what we all ate, but I was here on business with a large group and they took great care of us.  Here's what I remember  for certain.... the hummus  was amazing and everything I ate was fantastic!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland for the second time before I move here in March, I was pleasantly surprised by the quantity of restaurants serving high quality food. This restaurant was probably the best I have tried so far in Cleveland and I hope to return here sometime soon! We ordered a sampler platter of hummus, baba ganoush (don't know how to spell that) felafel and tabouleh. Everything was delicious and super fresh! We all ordered shishkabobs with various meats (chicken lamb and beef) which came with rice and vegetables. I ordered lamb. Sometimes when I order lamb at a restaurant it is tough and hard to chew. This lamb was very tender and excellently cooked. The atmosphere was nice on a Saturday evening with live music. Loved the baklava desert!"}
{"text":"I totally forgot to take photos - so sorry about that.

HOT TIP: free coffee and baklava with Yelp check in.

The platters are huge, we spilt the Chicken Kofta one, and still could not finish it. Please please get the fava bean dip that comes with fresh outta the oven pita bread. I wish I knew the recipe for that dip, it was supremely delicious.

Our waitress was a doll, and a bargain dinner for 4 people was only about $90."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Pita that comes freshly baked from the oven, still puffed up!  We had four appetizers, or mezza, for two of us.  Portions are big.  The lamb sausage with pomegranate sauce and the garlic spinach were both really good.  They have a kids menu and my son ate all of his chicken and rice.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  I loved the food but felt the Shish Grill prices were rather high $19.95 (Dinner Price) for Beef Kafta vs. Lunch price of ($10.95).  Crazy but fortunately I loved the dish!  I would go back again but would select a less expensive dish."}
{"text":"I am an airline pilot and naturally I experience a lot of restaurants around the country in my travels. 

This is by far the best Lebanese restaurant I have eaten in outside of Beirut. That includes Detroit and NYC. 

Food is outstanding and the service was too. Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"Coming from Michigan where delicious Meditteranean food is abundant, I was impressed with Taza. The interior is very warm and ornate with enough space to accomodate large groups. But don't mistaken this place for just a pretty interior, it's accompanied with great service, which includes the manager checking up on you to make sure everything is absolutely perfect. 

We were lucky enough to try the Restaurant Week menu, which included a nice variety. For appetizers, we started with the lentil soup, which was delish and perfect for warming you up on a cold and windy day. Our main course included the chicken shish tawook (Kabob with rice and grilled vegetables) and chicken fatteh (Mix of whole chick peas with tahini sauce). Both tasted amazing and we had more than enough to take home. Finally for dessert our server brought us a piece of Bassama and Baklava. My favorite was definitely the baklava."}
{"text":"Taza is a great spot for delicious, healthy and really flavorful middle eastern food. The menu is diverse and friendly to Vegans, which is great. 

I stopped in with a few girlfriends on a Wednesday and was happily surprised that they have a wine and app special that runs all night. If you buy a bottle of wine, you get a free app. Too kind!

The service is also wonderful and the decor is warm as well. Great downtown spot"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday while in town on business and was super impressed.  I had a big salad and a small hummus with chicken and had to take most of it home-  the portions are HUGE!  It was absolutely delicious.  I haven't had hummus this tasty since being in Israel- highly, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Really, really good. Delicious food, generous portions. The Lebanese Salata was fantastic, as was the hot mint tea. 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We chose Taza for dinner on our one day visit to Cleveland based on the reviews on Yelp. The food was amazing and we were lucky enough to have Kicksy as our server. She was amazing. Made sure we were all happy with our selections. We started with the vegetarian combo as our appetizer. The hummus, baba, tabouli and falafels were outstanding - quite possibly the best baba I've ever had.

For dinner we had the Lamb kabob, Fatteh Shawarma, and Shawarma Pita Roll. All were quite good, but the Fatteh Shawarma was outstanding."}
{"text":"Taza is great Lebanese food at an ok price $$.  My wife and I as well as 2 of our friends are there, had cocktails, 2 appetizers and 4 meals for under $140.  Not to bad.  The taste of the food was excellent!!!!  I love their hummus.  I strongly recommend a side of hot sauce with any dish you get.  The shish Tawook was delicious and my wife said she would eat it ever day if she could.  Overall the food was seasoned well.  Must try for lunch or dinner.  They also have 2 different plate sizes if you aren't as hungry and lots of vegetarian options as well.  Only negative comment: the lamb was a tad bit to fatty.  Otherwise it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"One star because I have to :-( The absolute WORST Lebanese food I have ever had! Can not believe they have 86 reviews & 4 stars. Also, co$t is u$ually not an i$$ue with me, but it become$ one when you get $UPER $mall portion$ @ a BIG price! However, we left over half of the tiny portions because the food was sooo HORRIBLE! Service also stunk & we were 1 of only 2 occupied tables in this LARGE establishment! Do yourself a favor & eat @ one of the other many GREAT downtown Cleveland restaurants!"}
{"text":"Best advice- don't stop the hummos! It's so good and although you might not have room for the main course, the bread paired with the hummos is addicting!

Order the Fateh, Shawarma Plate, or shish tawook- and you'll leave with a huge smile! The place is great for Lebanese food and it doesn't disappoint at all!! I'm a stickler for Lebanese food and had some minor qualms ( hence the 4 and not the 5), but really can't complain! 

Would definitely come again, and if they delivered to the east coast- I'd be broke?"}
{"text":"Everything (tour of taza, vegetarian platter, salmon dish and kebob) was exceptionally delicious. Highly recommended food."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had vegetable soup and Lebanese salad. Lots of healthy options, I'll come back next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am fan of Alladin's and Taza has the same star quality Lebanese food. Some of the best hummus I've had out and I'm a bitchy critic when it comes to my hummus. Service is excellent and the prices are on the money. Salads are delicious and fresh and love the space as its been modified from when Crop, another favorite, was there."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, but unfortunately 2-3 stars for service/atmosphere.

I stopped in here last night for dinner, and the place was dead. There were only 2 tables seated and a couple at the bar. It being Thursday night, I expected more of a crowd, but no big deal. You'd think because they weren't busy the service would be attentive, but when we first arrived no one was even at the host stand. No one was at the bar either. We actually had to step into the dining area and search for a staff member. We could see the two servers standing in the hallway talking, but neither made a move to come greet us. After awkwardly standing there for a few minutes we  had to flag one of them down and she finally led us to a table.

I think our server could tell we were a little peeved about not being greeted/having to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated, because for the remainder of our meal she was like overly nice, almost fake nice to us. We both got really weird vibes from her, and it made the meal a little uncomfortable. 

I'd ALMOST overlook all of that because the food was really good. As all the other reviewers mentioned, the portions are huge. Knowing this, we opted for two appetizers to split, the vegetarian feast (hummus, baba, tabouli, and falafel) and the dawali (grape leaves). We didn't even need to order entrees! The vegetarian feast is easily enough for four people. And they bring you as much pita as you can handle, which was perfect to scoop up those tasty spreads. They had a lot of great veggie options I'd definitely love to try. And for the amount of food we got, the price was pretty good. 

I'll give Taza another shot, because that food was tasty. In all honesty, I'd probably just order carry out and enjoy some of their tasty falafel at home, without the weird atmosphere and shaky service."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on a business trip.  We each had the Phoenician salad and a pita roll sandwich.  I had falafel, he had lamb; we both loved the food.  They brought pita bread to the table, which was also very good.  My only comment was that the sandwiches came with french fries, and we didn't really need that.  More pita bread would be better.  The service was fast and friendly; that may be because it was Sunday afternoon and hardly anyone was in there.  I have been at empty restaurants that ignore you though, so I want to give them credit.  They acted like no one else was there and they had nothing better to do than wait on us.
Truly the only bad thing about the experience was that when we left it poured down rain.  Despite my umbrella I was soaked when I got to my hotel 3 blocks away.  I can't blame the restaurant for the weather though.  It would have been a worse day without a good meal."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was the best. Portions were perfect and did I say the food was delicious?  It was. Best fries I've ever had. Kabobs were yummy. I strongly recommend this place. Tasty gem."}
{"text":"Service is very courteous, room is nice. Bread that they bring to the table is excellent. Food is flavorful and of good quality.  On the downside, the chicken salad I ordered had less than half as much chicken as any other chicken salad I have ever had. It did, however, have an enormous quantity of dates, so if that's among your favorite foods, I recommend it. They also char the meat more than any other place I've been, which may be your preference; it is not mine. Probably a four star place for most, and I would like to like it more, but it's about tenth-ranked among downtown restaurants for me."}
{"text":"okay i went out on a limb and tried lebanese food, and it was a tad too much for MY liking. The Fatteh was overkill, and i risked it even with the pine nuts, but the yogurt garlic sauce was too flavorful, overpowering, not fun. I know that lebanese food, any food from the middle east is usually packed with power but i feel like this place went overboard. Ive been to Aladdins which is a sister restaurant and that was fine, so maybe i caught a chef on a bad night? 

Service was eh, not rude but not helpful. They are quick and to the point when you order, and if you have any other questions about ingredients or stuff they are quick to shut you down.

For ME I wont be back, not my cup of tea, but on the fair scale of food in cleveland this was the 3 stars i gave it."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food.  I wish there was a bit more variety on the menu.  Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the vegetarian feast. It was delicious! I don't usually like falafel. Most places make a dried up and bland version but this falafel was soo good. The staff is very nice and the place is very pretty inside. I got my food to go but would definitely come back with friends."}
{"text":"I've had Taza twice now (once for takeout and another time dining in).  Falafel pitas are amazeballs.  Yes, I said amazeballs.  Not usually a word I use but it seems appropriate here since these things are delicious.   For this outing, I ordered the We  Taste of Taza (an assortment of dips and veggies including baba ghanoush and hummus).  Good Lord, this plate is huge.  And super filling.  Thank God it was shared between four people.  Even still, I probably didn't need to order a main entree but decided to go with the garden rolled pita.  Pretty good but a little too pickled for my taste.  Fried were delicious though.  All in all, Taza is always worth a stop and the staff is among the most helpful I've been around.  Lastly, I LOVE that the folks at Taza didn't change the decor of the restaurant too much.  It's a great space and it feels just as comfy and cozy as always."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! I forgot our waitress' name but she was so nice. The food was seasoned so well and the baklava!!! omgee. I usually don't like baklava because I find it to sweet but this was perfect. I ordered the beef kafta small plate which was super filling and delicious!  I will definitely be coming back next time that I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family, and it was pretty good! We came at 6pm on a Saturday, and we were surprised how many open tables there were! Our server was very peppy and helpful in suggesting dishes for us. We started with the taste of taza appetizer and dolmas. Everything was tasty, and the fresh pita was on point! For our entrees, we ordered the shawarma plate, the mixed grill, the cod dish, and one of the pita rolls, all of the food was really good and fresh tasting! For dessert we decided to split the kneffeh. It was kind of like microwaved mozzarella with a weird buttery thing on top- I'm sure this dish is delicious when prepared right, but even our server said the cheese is melted in the microwave- I probably wouldn't order that here again.

After we ordered our appetizers, we asked our server for another minute to pick our entrees, and she didn't come back for a really long time after to get our orders. That was kind of annoying, but it was the only problem we had with the service. One other thing we noticed was the whole restaurant got very smokey at one point- the ventilation in this restaurant probably needs work. They opened the doors to air out the place, but it made it kind of cold inside!

Overall, if I could give this place 3.5 stars, I would. The food is solid, but there were just a couple of issues with our dining experience. I would probably come back for the food. Also, check in on Yelp and you get a free Turkish coffee and baklava (I didn't realize that until after we finished our meal!)"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Lebanese food!  If you are planning a large event, the private room is super cool.  We had a group of 16 and the service was great. Definitely give this place a try!  Also, check in on yelp for free baklava!"}
{"text":"I had been on a date to Taza's before and had a lovely experience. Loved the food, the service a little slow, but good.

However, this most recent time I was there I was approached by a working server who had a lot to say about the company that I was with that particular evening. Being of Mediterranean decent myself, I understand cultural conflicts, but there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for racism or religious profiling off a group, ESPECIALLY in a restaurant where a large portion of the clients are Middle Eastern. I was so disgusted by the vulgar racism and upset that I could barely touch my food when it arrived.

The staff in a restaurant should be like the gorgeous wood paneling at the bar: SILENT. Unless I ask for a food recommendation, I do not want to hear snide racism the minute my dining friend is out of earshot. I would have hoped an upscale restaurant such as Taza's would have told their employees that.

Highly disappointed and upset.
Spoiled my appetite."}
{"text":"I love love love this place for lunch! I work just down the street in public square and the walk here is so worthwhile. Today I had lunch with a co-worker and Claire was our waitress. She was the cutest thing ever! The food is always spot on and soo good. My only complaint is I never have room for dessert!!! Next time ;)"}
{"text":"My buddy and I decided to come here for his birthday. He is from Palestine and I from Iran, so our taste buds have a very high intelligence when it comes to high quality Middle Eastern food.

We went there for lunch. For appetizers, we had the Dawali (stuffed grape leaves), the rarely found Lebanese Kibbeh Niyyah (special blend of spices mixes with raw meat), and bread (pocket pitas and regular flat pita bread) that came in from the popular Aladdin bakery in Cleveland that was served with a special dip (oregano mixed with sesame seeds and olive oil). All of this was at our table within five minutes of ordering.

We were delightfully surprised at how much Kibbeh Niyyah they brought out for us. But given the hefty price for the appetizer (along with it's scarcity), I'd say it was adequately priced (we're graduate students). The meat tasted super fresh, as if it was recently butchered and prepared within the day. Elegant designs were made on the meat with a fork, I believe.

The Dawali is a much more popular commodity in Middle Eastern establishments. Though somewhat petite, we were supplied with about ~7 of these delicacies, all sprinkled with feta cheese on top. I've had Dawali at other restaurants, but the Dawali at Taza's has been my best experience to date. These were the most perfectly rolled grape leaves I've ever had. Very well structured and sturdy enough to be eaten with a fork (yes, I'm the Persian). Didn't pay much attention to what it was specifically stuffed with since a funny conversation topic had come up, but if I had to guess it was the customary rice combined with garbanzo beans and maybe another one or two ingredients).

For our main entrees, we ordered the Shish Kabob and the Beef Kafta. Along with it came \"Lebanese rice\" (regular Basmati rice - Arabic blend), and about 5 large spoons worth of vegetables. These vegetables were amazing, as they were seasoned and well sauteed. For the lunch price, I'd say we received a fair amount of meat. I had two ~6-inch kaftas that were well-done, but juicy with the perfect amount of spices in it. My buddy had about ~8 cubes of lamb on his plate. Great experience on both ends. You also have the option between Tahini sauce (less consistency), garlic sauce (thick consistency), or both. We ordered both, I believe, at no extra charge. Entrees were at our table within 5-10 min.

For beverages, we ordered hot tea and iced pomegranate tea. Nothing too special. We appreciated both.

Because Yelp is awesome, we were able to redeem a special with the app, a free piece of baklava with Turkish coffee. They have three types of baklava available from Aladdin, pistachio, walnut, and cashew. They bring it in a small plate and drizzle it elegantly with a dash of pure honey. The Turkish coffee came in a cute small cup, but was very high quality. It was very strong with the pureed coffee beans sedimenting at the bottom. Amazing Turkish taste says my friend, as I'm not a big fan of coffee in general (Persian chayi fan :))

It is fair to mention that it was not very crowded when we went for a Wednesday lunch, so that should be taken into account for our fast serving times. Our waitress was a pleasant woman, going out of her way with good customer service.

The establishment itself is beautiful. Dim-lighting for you romantics, elegant tapestry, two-floors, and medium-sized banquet room on the first floor with a huge chandelier. Very well-built restaurant. Lots of thought put into the designs.

Great experience. Loved it and would definitely go again. Hope you guys and gals have as much fun as we did!"}
{"text":"Taza's food was very good! The staff was also extremely attentive and nice. We are very glad we came."}
{"text":"Okay so I was in for a \"kiss the summer goodbye\" date with my wife and we made reservations at this place.  It was Saturday night, and surprisingly for a 630 dinner there was hardly anybody in the place. So that was the first question mark of the night, and the only one.

The staff was very friendly and the service was very quick. But not in a pushy \"get out of here\" type of way quick. 

Personally I would recommend ordering a couple of the appetizers as the portions are huge, and the food is too good to stop eating. With that said they were very accommodating to boxing up what we had left to go (and it was still as good reheated). 

I'm picky about my 5 stars but I can see where someone may see it as a five."}
{"text":"I've frequented the Woodmere location more often than downtown, but the menus are the same.  I was attending a conference within walking distance on Saturday evening and decided to stop-in.  I used the Yelp-check-in to get free baklava and coffee, yum!  I was seated immediately upon entering, I ordered the Tabouli, for my appetizer,which is a little bit expensive at $9, but the portion was generous and it was very good.  I then order the Shish Tawook Kabob entree, which was priced, just right at $11, nicely seasoned chicken kabob, fresh grilled veggies and perfect portion of rice.  Service was a bit stand-offish, but all-in-all my meal was tasty!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, incredible pita puffs. I could eat 100 of those. Shawarma was delicious. Will be back next time in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Was glad I visited this place during my visit to Cleveland, OH. I had shish lamb, Turkish coffee and baklava along with fresh bread. The lamb was tender and juicy and had authentic flavor to it, although I felt the meat portion was a little less for the meal. The staff was nice and friendly. I recommend this place to anyone who likes Mediterranean cuisine. I will surely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner service for the first time. I had the lebanese jibneh and the lamb rolled pita. I had never had lebanese cheese before, but I was a big fan...I thought the pomegranate sauce was delicious. I felt less strongly about the rolled pita; it hit the spot, but I didn't think there was anything noteworthy about it. Also, the lamb seemed a bit tough and overcooked for a medium well request. I would like to come back and try some of the entrees off of the shish grill that I saw. Really friendly service and a good decor."}
{"text":"This place had a very friendly staff. The food itself was also great. The environment was very nice. Overall great place. I will come again if I am ever back in town."}
{"text":"Check in and you get a complimentary baklava and Turkish coffee!

But this place delivers in every way, the food was deliciouss, the place was gorgeous, wait staff was friendly, food arrived in a timely manner, they weren't too expensive, they were able to split the check, the table and bathroom was clean, what more can you ask?

I recommend:
Kibbie - which is like a fried bite-sized shepards pie with Lebanese spices, probably our favorite dish 
Falafel - crispy on the outside, well seasoned on the inside and not too mushy 
Baba - lots of lemon and garlic, flavor roller coaster, it was delicious

The so-so:
Hummus - they make it quite thick, and our table all thought it was just 'ok'. I took the leftover home, added some evoo and lemon, and it was perfection 
Makanek - sausage (the taste was similar to IHOP sausages.. lol) but it was bathed in this slightly sweet and vinegary sauce, it was pretty tasty to me, but didn't seem to appeal to anyone else

went with a party of 4 people, ordered 6 of the appetizer dishes to share and it only came out to $12 per person

Overall, a place that really wins on flavor and seasoning, I had a good time, if you like Lebanese food, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Really nice place in this area. Loved the food, the service and the ambiance. everybody was friendly and helpful. we had their famous Lebanese Jibneh and  my God it was the best thing I ever ate (for the same concept of grilled cheese!). our entrees were very delicious as well and perfectly portioned.
Outside seating here is great!
I will definitely be coming here whenever I visit Cleveland :-)"}
{"text":"First time trying out Taza. We fell in love with the setting and the decor. The stuff was okey, the waitress never came back to check on us. We ordered kibbeh which fell apart and was too oily. The food overall was okey. We liked the rice and the grilled veggies. We got chicken kafta and tawook, they tasted strange, and some pieces of the tawkook weren't cooked properly. But we appreciated the free Turkish coffee and baklava."}
{"text":"Soooooo good.  Salad and app sampler were delicious. Very fresh"}
{"text":"Came here because we heard it's good. Arrived at 10:30 to get a takeout order since they're supposed to be open till 11 but they're already closed, pretty disappointed that the manager or whoever was running the restaurant wouldn't even come to the door. Just shook his head no and then ignored us. I understand when business is slow that you can close early but when it's no where close to closing time and you're closing early, if you are actually there it's common courtesy to at least come to the door and apologize or something but whatever.

Update: I wanted to give this place an actual chance so I came back at a time I knew they couldn't close early and did not disappoint. We are there is a ton of food and it was very reasonably priced and everything we ordered was delicious. What we had was the manakeesh hummus both platters and some chicken kafta and our entire party was talking about how good the food was the next day still. The total bill for 5 people came out to about 150 with tip which included drinks and trust me we can all eat. I'll have to come back to the place one more time in order to give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is literally the best medeterranian food I've ever had. Everything tasted freshly made. The seasoning was sublime; real skill went into preparing this food. Bravo to the cooks. I had the fattoush (sp?!?) salad and a falafel sandwich for lunch. Maybe I was just that hungry,  but it was elevated beyond any other medeterranian I've tasted. In the same way that after a point you stop being able to describe music with words, I don't think I can describe this place adequately. My recommendation is to just try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Some of the best Lebanese food I've had. The spicy hummus was amazing. However, the service wasn't the best. But their food and portion sizes made up for it."}
{"text":"Wow what a great meal we had in Cleveland here.  We were able to sit outside and had a great time with wonderful service and the food was amazing.  

When you sit down they bring a bread basket with different types of bread.  They come with a dipping sauce that was great.  We ordered the vegetarian plate for an appetizer that had so much food on it.  We could have just ate the appetizer and bread and been full.  

I ended up getting a lamb entre the dinner size and it was huge!!!  The offer the lunch size and dinner size and I am a big eater and could not finish the dinner portion.  The food had a lot of great flavor and tasted amazing.  

I would for sure recommend this place for a great meal."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland for 4 nights with another couple.  Went to Taza while one member sat out and had such a good time we all went back the next night to share with her what she'd missed.

The menu has many options but both evenings we decided to order a variety of appetizers selected to sate both our vegetarian and meat eating palates.  We began with the puffed pitas which are terrific, followed by the garlic spinach, dawali, potato cilantro and loubie which were enjoyed by us all while the makanek and the kibbie nayyeh were especially welcomed by the carnivores.  The delicious Lebanese red wines we enjoyed were a welcome addition to the fare.

The restaurant is a warm and inviting place and if you're lucky enough to be given a tour of the private back room you'll be amazed at the size and beauty of the chandelier that graces the ceiling.  The waitresses both evenings were wonderful.  The manager, Souheil, was knowledgeable and friendly.  I left asking him to please keep us informed of any plans of opening a Taza in NYC. 

You will not be at all disappointed by visiting this fine restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Taza, initially a few menu items caught my eye upon making my decision of the Garlic Spinach and and entree vegetarian hummous wrap. my journey began. 

The spinach was wonderful, however not an item if you don't like garlic, the strong aroma hit my nose before the fork hit my lips. The Veg Hummous Wrap, was great, I ordered take out and between picking up all my food and  eating my fear was the the structure of the food would suffer, it did not. 

My wrap was stupendous wrapped tight packed end to end, and not spilling over with sauce. The only thing that was less than positive about my expeience is the menu on yelp and online contains smoothies which i order upin arrival i was given a water and told they didn't have smoothies for atleast 3 months kind of a dissappointment but I will definately be back"}
{"text":"I had reeeeeeeeeally high hopes for this place after reading all the reviews, but I was left underwhelmed. Yes, the portions are huge. Yes, the pricing is fair. However, everything is under seasoned (I'm used to middle eastern food being very flavorful), except for the salmon, it tasted like licking a lemon. I guess it's just Aladdin's in a gussied up building. The dining room is beautiful.

p.s. order a drink, the water taste like metal."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC Middle Eastern food.   I have tried most of the Cleveland areaMiddle Eastern restaurants, and after just one carry out visit, I have a new favorite.   I ordered the Shish Tawook entree.   And I loved everything about the meal.   Their rice is great, the grilled veggies are a great twist, and the chicken is amazing.  I asked for some extra pita, and when I dug into my dinner, I was so glad I did.   That pita is unlike any I have had.   I am already planning tomorrow's dinner."}
{"text":"When my Lyft driver picked me up after the meal, he told me it was the best restaurant in town.  He was Lebanese so he could be biased, but based upon the consistency in excellent quality, taste, and service-- I know he can't be far off!   Back in 2015, I visited this restaurant twice in one week I like it so much.  So, when I found I was going to be back in Cleveland 3 years later, I couldn't wait to return back to Taza!  Amongst many excellent eateries, this one stood out enough for me to make sure I got back to.  I was not disappointed, my 2018 visit reinforced all of my positive memories! Consistent, excellent quality.  Reasons: One of the most excellent dirty martinis I ever had. Food is flavorful and fantastic.  Whether it's the bread or the shawarma, you'll find quality and tastiness in every bite making you wish your stomach could handle more!   I didn't get to visit during Happy Hour this time, but I remember in 2015 they had an excellent Happy Hour menu of food and drinks.  If this holds true, you'll find great value for your buck whether its in drinks or food that I think is hard to beat.  Definitely will plan my visit anytime I return to Cleveland!  Thanks Taza!"}
{"text":"I was one of those guys.  It was 20 minutes till closing and I called in an order.  I know you're judging me but it doesn't stop there.  I told them I'd arrive right at closing.  The reaction on the other end of the line was so friendly and accommodating.

My arrival came minutes after closing and the manager invited me in to get my food. She added a couple baklava for my check in and some extra bread. All the mean time being so hospitable and positive. 

I ate my grape leaves and hummus on top of a pedestal at city hall.  The high school kids leaving prom kept looking at me.  Were they jealous I was eating delicious grape leaves while they were dancing to selena gomez songs?   Absolutely."}
{"text":"Really great food. We had the Lebanese raw lamb appetizer, falafel and a Mixed Grill I. Everything was fresh and tasty. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Vegetarian feast and the beef kafta are my two favorite. The hummus is really good here and I love the people. They really make you feel at home.
I could eat the bread all the time."}
{"text":"OMG, was amazing!!!! They replenish your bread bowl without asking. The owner pays attention to his guests. The food was so tasty. The salad...OMG! I just LOVE LOVE this place. Great job yelpers in guiding me to the right place"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this restaurant. I made a reservation in the morning for 6:45pm. We walked in the door and we're immediately told that we don't have a reservation without even asking for my name. I repeated my reservation was confirmed and my name. The male who greeted us cut off the other hostess and said we just had a large party and don't have any place for you but outside. I explained we cannot sit outside because we have an infant with us. 

Essentially, we were greated with rudeness, our reservation was not honored, and no accomodation was made for us othan than to sit outside. This is not a way to treat customers and I am very upset that my first visit to Cleveland is tainted by this experience."}
{"text":"One word - consistent!  It is the exact same menu as it's sister restaurant in Eaton Plaza, and that dang good pita and amazing olive oil is still a standard.  THANK YOU! 

I think Taza has wonderful food, and they are keen to side substitutions - yep, I'm that gal!  I don't want fries with my wrap, I want something that's more in tune with the flare of the menu! 

Great wrap options: Shawarma (lamb, beef and chicken), Falafel, Hummus.

Great Entree Options: Mujadara (personal favorite), Salmon, Tuna."}
{"text":"Taza is a great place to visit! It's beautifully decorated and their patio is perfect in the summer time! I love the spicy hummus (which I don't find to be all that spicy). The only reason they didn't get a 5th star is because I haven't found a menu item that I'm in love with just yet."}
{"text":"Some say it's too expensive, but certainly the quality of the food backs it up in my book!  The chicken shwarma lunch wrap is spectacular, the hummus with chicken really hits the spot, and for the garlic lovers the shish tawook is pretty great."}
{"text":"Was there for the second time on Saturday night. Had a great table by the window, the food was delicious. Highly recommend the beef kafta. The only complaint I have was our waitress wasn't very good. Never came back to fill our water or ask if we wanted to order more drinks. We had to track her down! Asked for grilled veggies instead of fries and that didn't happen. Asked for tahini sauce and never saw her again until she brought the bill. I didn't complain because it just wasn't worth it to me. I like the place and love the food. Hopefully the service will be better next time!"}
{"text":"Place was nearly empty on a Wednesday night.  Only one other table during our visit.  This meant that service was not an issue.  The food was good, as it typically is at Taza.

The one minor issue during our meal came at the end, as we had just finished our meals.  The general manager came over to our table to scold us because our children were not seated, and they were disturbing other diners.  While I understand that they needed to be seated, her demeanor was overly harsh.  We were considering ordering coffee and desert, but we decided it was time to go.  Considering how empty the restaurant was, we didn't understand the vitriol unleashed in our direction.

The good news for the general manager is that she won't have to put up with our large dinner bills again..."}
{"text":"Superb.  I am Leb and this was excellent food.  When traveling I like to go to Mediterranean restaurants and sample different versions of the food I grew up eating.  We sat outside and it was pleasant, even with the traffic just steps away.  The young Lebanese lady who waited on us was an excellent server."}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for 4 years now and don't know how I never heard of this place! Hint hint marketing. We were wonderfully delighted when a contractor recommended we go for lunch. The decor and not to mention the historic building were beautiful. The pita puffs and oil were beyond delicious. We had various plates at our table, lamb, beef, chicken were all said to be cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Being a vegetarian, I loved how flavorful the lentil soup and the mujadara were! Our waitress was quite friendly although she was overly busy and we weren't really waited on after we got our food. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here!  We enjoyed tuna, salmon, dolma (but it was called by a different name on the menu can't remember what), baklava and best of all the Turkish coffee...yum!  Everything was delicious!  I used my most reliable advisor -- Yelp -- to find this restaurant and had to coerce my friends to come here and now they're raving about it!  They're talking about making the two-hour drive on a regular basis to bring other friends/visitors back here in the future.  
I enjoyed the decor a lot.  Initially one of my friends wanted to go to a nearby bar (boo!) and I suspect that we got this delicious meal for a equal or lesser price than what we would have paid at a bar.  The music was relaxing (vs. tvs blaring sports games and creating tons of background noise), the decor soothing and it was really nice to linger over a delicious, mindful meal and have a great conversation with friends. 
The only drawback for me was that the baklava was not as fresh as it should be.  It still tasted good, but the phyllo dough was not soft and supple as I expected it to be.  
All-in-all though, I definitely recommend this as a place to try out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff. Generous portions. Delicious food. We split the Taste of Taza app and mujadara entree (small). Both were great. The complimentary warm pita bread was soooo good. Also had free Turkish coffee and baklava for checking in on yelp. Only complaint is that the men's room doesn't have a baby changing station, but the changing station in the women's bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Good, 5 stars. Service 3 stars, avg 4 stars overall.  Great food in a beautiful restaurant. 

Decor: I really like the decor of this place. It's very warm and intimate. 

Food: Their food is awesome! They have the best hummus and their kabobs are really good. 

Prices:  Prices are average/normal and it has good value.  

Service: Service was meh. The girl completely forgot about us and never checked on us or refilled our water.

I'd recommend this place, overall it was a good experience :)"}
{"text":"Taza is right by office so this is a frequent stop for me. Usually I'm ordering take out and bringing it back to the office, but I have eaten at the restaurant a few times. I've only had lunch here so I've only had the salads here. The Spinach salad is probably my favorite on the menu. It's a little different with oranges added to it, but I like it. I'll sometimes add chicken or salmon to my salads, which can make it a little pricier. I tried Baba here for the first time and absolutely loved it. I could easily make the switch from hummus, which I love, to Babba. Overall, I'd say this is your classic Mediterranean restaurant that is great if you are looking for a healthy choice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat downtown! Beautifully decorated, nice ambiance, and most importantly...delicious food! Taste of Taza is always my go to. You pretty much have a taste of their most popular dishes in one plate. Their salads are amazing, falafels are tasty, pitas are grilled to perfection, and the baklava cheesecake is stuff dreams are made of. I highly recommend this place for date night or big group to indulge in amazing food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland so far! We came for dinner and our waitress brought out soft, warm, just baked pita bread to start. We ordered an entree each (portion sizes are very generous). I had the cod with a side of bulgur, which was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend had the shawarma plate, which came with what  I thought were some of the most delicious fries I'd ever tasted (they melted in our mouths!). The fries, cod, and meat were all seasoned superbly. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I am so pleasantly surprised by this place!  

I live in the neighborhood and have passed it by so many times, expecting it to be an Aladdin's-level place (which I'm not a fan of, being the falafel and shawarma snob that I am).

My boyfriend and I stopped in for happy hour food and drinks at the bar on our way over to the Indians game last night though, and had a great experience.

First, their pita is too good. I can't even remember how many I ate, but I already want more. We ordered the falafel, shawarma, the feta and zaatar manakish, and hummus fatteh.  The shawarma and falafel were really delicious, I devoured them. Manakish wasn't my favorite, and the hummus fatteh was actually tahini (I didn't read the menu description well enough), which I don't love- although my boyfriend did like it a lot.

We couldn't finish it all, we were so stuffed. And our food bill? It was barely over $10. I felt like I was stealing. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for the first time and stopped in for lunch. Wow, what a find! Amazing flavors and fresh veggies. The perfect Mediterranean meal. We had the tabouli salad, falafel wrap, and baklava cheesecake and would definitely order all three again. 

To top it off, Claire was one of the best servers we've ever had. So friendly and accommodating. Such a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Food very clean tasting and was cooked perfectly Love the food   Staff was fair not the most friendly but food made up for that"}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch as well as ordered to go and both ways are absolutely delicious. The sampler appetizer is a great way to try a bit of everything and their salads are very large. They also give fresh, warm pita with everything- who doesn't love pita?!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and the food was wonderful. It was expertly prepared with very authentic flavors and sauces. The wait staff were wonderful and the atmosphere is lush and ornate. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I choose this restauant after business meeting in downtown Cleveland upon a recommendation of a Starbucks bucks customer on W 6th Street. Food was great. Server was great! Her name was Taylor.
Wife had lamb. I had a lamb wrap."}
{"text":"I'm a wedding planner who organized a rehearsal dinner at this location and was very happy with the process and the services received before and during the event!  The attendees complimented the delicious food and the variety offered from types of dishes, to types of wine/beer.  The planning process with Souheil was very pleasant, and day-of he was very accommodating and went above and beyond to ensure the event went off seamlessly!  On top of the restaurant offerings, the staff was incredibly hard working and quickly would take on any request that I threw their way.  Everyone was so warm and really made you feel like they cared for doing a great job, which I appreciated very much and I know the newlyweds did too.  Thank you, Taza, for a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING!  Great middle Eastern flavors, excellent service, beautiful place.  Leigh's was our waitress and she gave us great answers to our questions and fabulous service.  I kept saying, \"this is so delicious\" through the whole meal. The garlic spinach was so full of flavor, falafel perfect, kabob and vegetables...not a single bad thing."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I was impressed. Great Atmosphere, great food and our server Jeannette was fantastic."}
{"text":"Taza has some of the best Lebanese food I've had in a LONG time! I was in town for a conference and needed a good meal after a day of sad conference food. I got the baba, pickles, green bean dish and a fattoush salad (definitely had delicious leftovers). All were vegan and the green beans had the perfect amount of spice, the pita on the fattoush had great seasoning and the pita wasn't super greasy like it can be in some places. I had take out but the restaurant looked really nice! Would definitely recommend this spot. It was super fast too - less than 15 minutes for the whole order and they were really friendly when I picked up the food."}
{"text":"I asked the server what was the most authentic item or items on the menu. She was helpful and pointed out that only a few were NOT instead of the other way around. We ordered a few appetizers to share as a meal. Three were plenty as a meal! Since I have no way to assess the authenticity, I can only rate by the flavors. All three dishes were quite tasty but the chicken was over cooked and dry. Still, the combinations were nice. Worth a second visit if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!! Four of us came to Cleveland to visit the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, for the Labor Day weekend. After a full day of rocking and rolling, we were tired and hungry. Enjoying middle eastern cuisine, we looked for something in Yelp and based on other people's reviews, we decided on Taza. We're glad we did. From the general manager, Hakeem, to our waitress, Jess, to the food - EXCELLENT - EXCELLENT. Seafood dishes, mixed grill and chicken dishes, appetizers, bread - ALL GREAT.  Reasonably priced, great atmosphere and decor. Can't say enough about this place, except, open one in NY."}
{"text":"Beautiful Lebanese restaurant in the Warehouse District. Although it wasn't the best Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food I've ever had, it was pretty darn good. The outdoor dining area was also very pretty, and we enjoyed sitting out there. Our hummus and pita appetizer was delicious, though its consistency was a bit thinner than I like. The lamb shish was cooked very well and was nicely marinated, but the star of the show for me were the grilled veggies. They were absolutely scrumptious. My goddaughter really enjoyed her chicken tawook wrap and fries. On a recommendation from our server, I tried a Lebanese white wine. I wasn't crazy about it, but that's no fault of theirs, it's just my personal taste. The only reason I'm not giving Taza 5 stars is because the service was very slow. Very friendly, just slow, but I'll take slower and friendly over faster and rude any day of the week."}
{"text":"The best Lebanese restaurant in Cleveland area. The lentil soup is divine. Everything is tasty and delightful and the service is very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've probably been here 7 times now, and I have been living in Cleveland for 11 months. So authentic and so tasty. You MUST get the Lebanese jibneh for an app."}
{"text":"We went with a big group and the food was really good! The Lebanese Jibneh was our favorite, we also really liked the Tabouli. The Potato Cilantro is to superb! The Dawali is a bit of an aquired taste, the Garlic Spinach was good as well. Falafel was the best I've had. Kibbie was good, looked like corn dogs but tasted really good too. 

As our entrée, I shared the Mixed Grill II with my mom since we were already stuffed from our smorgasbord of appetizers. The lamb was cooked medium and the flavor was not overly gamey. The chicken was excellent and juicy. The side salad was quite large too! I could have eaten that as my entrée after all we ate earlier. 

We would definitely return next time we are back in town!

Don't forget to check-in on yelp for a free baklava!"}
{"text":"I went to Taza this past November and had a lovely experience. My waitress, Claire, showed my date and I all of the menu options and was always ready to answer questions about Arabic cuisine."}
{"text":"You have to go here! We found this place by mistake but so glad we did. 
Taylor, our server was fantastic & knew the menu really well!!!kudos to her + she was friendly & polite throughout the service.
Had the Taza sampler to start ,ahi tuna small plate, & hubby had the small plate of lamb shish kabob , more than enough . All was delicious ..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We ordered the hummus and falafel appetizers. I then had the Shwarama Fettah plate. The pita chips in it were fresh and authentic like the rest of the food. This place far exceeded my expectaions. After having been to Israel, I have had a hard time finding Mediterranean places that compare. 

Our waitress was also awesome! Her name is Taylor. She is sweet and funny. It is hard to find a server with such a great personality."}
{"text":"Taza is a refreshing and healthy Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant in the heart of the Warehouse District. In a sea of sports bars, Taza is a welcome escape.

I stopped here recently for a quick bite with Yelper Jane F. I had the green tea and the salad with chicken shawarma. Was I totally head-over-heels? Not necessarily, but the food was exactly the lightweight lunch I was hoping for, and i'd be back. The salad was super fresh and the service was fairly quick. Our server was very attentive, to the point where she even offered to take the straw wrapper I was nervously playing with (nervous habit)!

I think Taza is always hoppin'. I've actually never seen it empty. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, I think you'll also be over the moon. The menu is healthy and looks very accommodating to all dietary restrictions, which is super hard to come by in Cleveland. I will agree with the others-- it can be pricey, but hey, you're in the heart of the city. They also have a great outdoor patio, you know, just in case its in the 70s in the middle of November ;)"}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

We came here one evening for a group dinner for 12 people on a Tuesday evening. We were pleased that we were able to get a reservation on such short notice.

We arrived a bit early before the rest of our party - so we sat at the Bar and sampled the Great Lakes Christmas Ale - topped with a healthy and generous dose of ground cinnamon (never seen that before - but it works!).

As the rest of our party arrived, we moved to our table. We ordered some community appetizers - a couple of orders of hummus in different spice levels. I especially enjoyed the spicy hummus vs. the regular.

For dinner - I ordered the Shawarma - which I've never had before. I felt I needed to sample this after seeing Tony Stark insist The Avengers go out and eat Shawarma after their  defeat of Loki and his Chitauri Army in the epic film \"The Avengers.\"

The Shawarma meat itself is a generous quantity of meat, sort of finely chopped, served with grilled onions and a large side of seasoned fries. I found the whole meal to be a bit on the greasy side. It was tasty, but I did not come close to finishing the food due to the greasiness.

Service was good, ambiance was nice. I'd come back here to try some other Lebanese dishes!"}
{"text":"This is the best Lebanese restaurant I have ever been to - EVER.  I am from Chicago and a bit of a food snob.  The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  Try everything on the menu, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"All the meats here are well-seasoned and perfectly tender, which is largely what I was hoping for when first going there for dinner, but I think what really sells this place is the sampling you can get of many of the typical Lebanese dishes. Whether you go for the meat or vegetarian option for the appetizer sampler, keep in mind that it's a lot of food on its own and may not leave a whole lot of room for a big entree!

Service here is pretty reliable, nothing spectacular but no real pain points. It can be pretty quiet on weeknights, so if that's not your preference, try to sit outside for some nice people-watching on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad: the sangria wasn't very good.  But I feel like that was our fault for ordering sangria at a Lebanese restaurant.  Honestly, in retrospect, I feel silly about the whole thing.  End of list.

Onto the good things: first, as other reviewers have mentioned, if you can sit at one of Clair's tables, do it.  She's fantastic at her job not only as a waitress but as an ambassador for the restaurant and the cuisine it serves.  Second, the location and atmosphere is pretty great.  Sitting outside on a nice evening or at the bar on a not-nice evening provides pleasant surroundings and an oasis of authenticity in what can sometimes be a desert of douchey vibes up and down W 6th St.  Third, get the jibneh.  It's listed as an appetizer, but it really should be in a separate category as some kind of cheese course (and I could see having it at any time during a meal--first, as a side, as an intermezzo course, even as a savory dessert).  You get 4 pieces of delicious Lebanese cheese in a pomegranate sauce with...well, you can read a menu, but thanks to Clair's guidance, I ordered the right thing and was not disappointed.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood on a summer night, I'm definitely stopping off for a beer and some cheese."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner with a few friends - we were in town for a conference. First impression was awesome! Our waitress was very friendly and personable. She helped us with recommendations since many of us were new to the restaurant (but not necessarily the cuisine). It was a Thursday - $5 martini night and they were excellent.

When our meals arrive, the food was amazing! The flavor was great and they put a lot on the plate. I got the Mixed Grill I and would recommend it for anyone trying Lebanese for the first time. The food was a little pricy, but for the downtown location, atmosphere, and the food it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit for work and have been to this restaurant twice now. I've always recieved top notch service, and the ambiance is very upscale while remaining authentic. The food is amazing as well. What really stood out is that there was a scheduled private event an hour from when I walked in they were srambling, but the owner graciously allowed me in and never made me felt rushed through my meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! Very friendly service!! Came in on a Saturday night without reservations and was still able to get squeezed in. Great selection of food and drinks. Very mom and pop feel. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to try something new!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous flavors abound in the middle eastern gem. Had the spicy hummus which was outstanding but the puffer bread made it even better. The shish lamb was amazing with such wonderful flavor and tender. The rice And veggies did not disappoint

Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I admit it. Coming from Brooklyn NY and living near the Middle Eastern restaurant Mecca of Atlantic Ave, I am a bit of a Middle Eastern cuisine snob. This restaurant served above-average ME cuisine in a very nice, upscale casual and spacious atmosphere. The food was definitely not the best I have had, but definitely above average. Was very disappointed with the Baba (babaganoush) appetizer and somewhat stale pita. The lamb kebab was very good, tender and flavorful, although the accompanying tahini sauce was watery, and there were few vegetables. Pilaf was excellent. It was nice that they had wine from Lebanon on the menu. Service was attentive and our meal was served quickly. $65 for two was reasonable. Not the best restaurant in the area (Lola and Greenhouse Tavern are much better) but a good choice if Middle Eastern cuisine is desired."}
{"text":"Wow, what an awesome surprise! This is what good food is about! My girlfriend and I started with a lemon drop drink and an Almarza(Lebanese pilsener beer), both were very good. Spicy hummus appetizer and Zaatar sauce, pure excellence! Girlfriend ordered Shish kebob with rice and tahini sauce, she loved it! I ordered the Mujadara( steamed lentils, rice, crispy onions) this was amazing!!!  Both entrees were GREAT!!  Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten this type of food a few times, but the flavors were amazing. The humans dips & bread were tasty. The salads were brilliant with flavors. Definitely come back"}
{"text":"Don't pass the place up.  Fantastic!  Jasmine was sweet and provided great suggestions.  Thank you for the awesome service."}
{"text":"On a mission to not eat ordinary food, eat at all the restaurants in downtown cle, and dine by myself, I was very delighted to eat at Taza..  Lunch  was delicious and wait staff was the best. Thank you Taza for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The Phoenician salad is my go-to lunch salad and I can't help but smash the za-tar and sesame oil that comes with the warm pita. They've got fantastic vegan/vegetarian choices and overall the service is good, but sometimes a little slow. Plus they are a little pricier because it's downtown and when compared to their more casual chain, Alladin's eatery. They have a nice patio as well so if you're in the mood for a culinary change in the downtown scene, Taza is your place."}
{"text":"Fast service. Quiet atmosphere. Kind of seemed like  place for a romantic dinner date rather then a get together meal.  Ordered the Hummus and Taboule for appetizer which were delicious but I wasn't really into the Taboule which makes me feel like you have to have an acquired taste for it.  The pita was so fresh and delicious with the Hummus which totally made my night! I then ordered the Shwarma which was a bit different for me because I never had Beef Shwarma before and I couldn't help but compare it to my Chicken Shwarma experiences in Chicago and Texas which was absolutely phenomenal!  The beef Shwarma was delicious and bursting with flavor but made me feel weird they served it with fries since I wasn't expecting.  Yet, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer Chicken Shwarma like the other Middle Eastern restaurants I've been to.  Last but not least I ordered the Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake which was so rich in flavor and totally hit my sweet cravings.  Will come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Chicken hummus is very good. We enjoyed having Hassan to serve us. We will return next time we are in Cleveland. Recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing!

On Easter Sunday, the seafood restaurant next door to Taza was closed. I'm glad, because I got to go to Taza instead. 

The free appetizer was pita bread and olive oil with sesame seeds. The bread was fresh and warm. It was so soft, it melted in my mouth. The olive oil had other delicious spices. 

I ordered the mixed grill plate which I highly recommend. The lamb was prepared medium rare, just the way I like it. The chicken had that nice grill flavor and was not dry. The beef sausage was very good and complimented on the rice very well. 

There was so much food!"}
{"text":"the crowd caught a whiff
of that crazy casbah jive
or the shish kebabs

Stepping into Taza is a bit jarring.  You come in from West 6th into a gold and glammy palace.  I've been twice now.  Service was well meaning and sincere, but not quite as polished up as the GOLD EVERYWHERE.  Last time I had an awesome spinach/pinenut/garlic appetizer.  Baba Ganoush was top shelf. The beef in the kabob, ordered medium rare, was on the tough side.  Lots of veggie options.  All in all, pretty solid.  

Carry on, and rock the casbah."}
{"text":"Delicious meal and great atmosphere.

Would highly recommend the  Lebanese Jebneh appetizer and Chicken Kofta."}
{"text":"Best authentic Lebanese food. Friendly environment and great service. Their beef shawarma is a must try. 
5 stars !"}
{"text":"The food is always consistently amazing here and the service is excellent. This is the best Mediterranean food in Cleveland. My favorite is the hummus chicken, I get the hot sauce on the side and ask for extra pita, both of which the servers are happy to accommodate. Their salads are always fresh and tasty, both salad dressings are delicious and they will give you both on the side if you ask."}
{"text":"A unique dining experience with Excellent ambiance. Food was delectable, service was very good especially with having a party of 8. Not your usual w.6th st experience, Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"LOVED Taza! Our guests were big fans of Lebanese food after traveling abroad, and were so impressed with the authenticity of their dishes. We tried an assortment of mezze plates to try, and my favorite by far was the baba ghanoush. Their pita was so warm fluffy and delicious. One plate was a mixed meat platter, and everything was fabulous. I highly recommend going with a group and ordering a bit of everything! The only dish I did not care for was the tabbouleh, but only because it had lots of parsley, which I make mine without."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmy!!!! 

The chicken with veggies, rices, and garlic sauce... Omg. So good. 

They give you Pita bread in the beginning so you can then make a pita sandwich. 

I am still wanting that chicken! 

Check into Yelp and get a free baklava. 

The service was good. She was nice and attentive. 

We got the garlic potato which was good. If it was crispier I would've loved it. Imagine breakfast potatoes. 

Lentil soup was amazing! 

Parking is hard to find since its downtown but come try it out."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I have ever ate at!! The food was just amazingly unexplainable !! Our server who was Taylor was amazing as well . Everything about this place was just amazing ! Def recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing little find! I haven't had Lebanese cooking since my grandmother passed away a few years ago and one bite here brought back so many great memories. The food here will NOT come quickly to your table, but that's because everything is made fresh and with so much attention to detail and perfect taste. I was not disappointed and can't wait to come back here again. The service was just as great and our experience was perfect from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Came here last week for lunch with some coworkers, I can never pass up Mediterranean! Everything from the pita (I'm still thinking about that dip) to the service was good. I chose a salad with chicken, pine nuts, and feta. Everything in the salad worked so well together I would order it again and again! Based off of the amazing reviews I can't wait to come back and try more Mediterranean dishes."}
{"text":"Worst experience my wife had. Bad service. Charge  $800 on 3 different people on their card.
Now manager making story and telling us lies."}
{"text":"A Good Lebanese restaurant which was different to what I usually eat but it was good never the less. I ordered the Shish Lamb and it had nice juicy pieces of lamb with delicious lebanese rice with grilled vegetables. It's just a great simple place for good ethnic food."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Lebanese restaurants I have ever been to. 

We were visiting Cleveland and this popped up on Yelp as one of the restaurants to try - it was a good recommendation. 

The food is so fresh and honestly, PURE DELICOUSNESS!!!! For starters they give you pita with an olive oil/sesame seed mix. I ordered a grilled Chicken salad - the chicken was so tender and they gave a good amount of vegetables. My husband ordered the Shwarma wrap which was equally delicious.

Besides the amazing quality of food, the service was pretty awesome too :) They seated us right away (we came during lunch hour) and our waitress was very attentive. 

The decor was very intricate and cozy, bathrooms very luxrious and the stall doors go all the way to the floor (I am sucker for stall doors to the floor). 

Overall, amazing experience and I recomomend this if you are stopping through Cleveland and in the mood for some Mediterranean food!!!!"}
{"text":"Did this as take out while staying at the nearby Ritz Carlton.  SO GLAD I DID!.  Food was fantastic.  The restaurant is gorgeous, but I was by myself and needed to work.  I asked for  a special order on Mixed Grill 1, they accommodated and it was delicious.  The Baba Ganouch, the tabouli, and the meat were amazing.  I can't wait to go back.  Cleveland has a HUGE Lebanese population, so the food was bound to be good.  I found it to be GREAT!"}
{"text":"I met a few colleagues here and got a shish tawook wrap with fries. Both were really good. I was impressed at lunch that they gave us bread and zatar dip to start."}
{"text":"Great service by Pricilla! I got the hummus falafel wrap with grilled veggies. Perfect all around. The service made the meal. I would def come back"}
{"text":"Oh man oh man, this place is delicious! 

I adore the decor inside, I love the patio outside (great for people watching) and their food is so delicious. 

I love walking in and having a hostess walk me to a talk while I stare at the decor inside. Make sure to look at the ceiling when you are in there, it's pretty amazing. There is nothing better than the pita bread you are provided with the mouthwatering bread dip. Their hummus is the best, their soups are so good and their Taza Chicken Salad is a must try. 

I seriously fall in love with Middle Eastern food time and time again after eating here."}
{"text":"Flavorful food, excellent service! My sister and I visited on Mother's Day. We had the dawali, jibneh, and shish tawook. It was all delicious. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have high standards and if it were up to me I'd move to Cleveland for this restaurant. The service was excellent! I probably should've tipped above my usual 20% because restraint work is hard work. The chef would make a killing if he had a tip jar! Everything and I mean everything did not disappoint! My husband who a eat to live and drinks $2 bottles of Chardonnay doesn't particularly care for Veggies actually ate and cleaned the entire plate. He doesn't  hand out accolades often. But he had lamb shish and it was perfectly cooked well seasoned and the rice which having grown up in Egypt he's particular about rice was on point. I ordered Chicken Fattah and it was the BEST fattah I have had this includes in Houston or Washington DC which have respectable restaurant options and diversity. The yogurt was creamy, the chick peas flavorful and definitely freshly made from soaking not the canned type. The parsley was fresh crunchy and offered a refreshing cleanse of the palate that complimented the dish. If anyone is a Turkish coffee or baklava fan then you won't be disappointed here! Pistachio baklava is my favorite and it seems so hard to find sometimes I think it's because most Greek and middle eastern use walnuts. I simply loved our meal and I couldn't think of even one bad thing. A customer even spilled coffee on themselves and the staff was quick to offer a clean towel and not make the patron feel embarrassed. Truly top notch service!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely and incredibly delicious. The atmosphere is nice and the decorations are elegant. Clair was our waitress, she is super super nice and professional. Her kindness and warmth made my visit to Taza even nicer. The Manager came to check on us twice and he was very gentle and professional. We ordered Spicy Hummus, Tabouli, Dawali as appetizers, and Shawera plate, my friend got beef kefta as entrées. All dishes were so good. I strongly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Lebanese restaurant since moving to Cleveland.  The food was very good.  Falafel was amazing.  Service was less than good."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and unexpectedly had the first evening to myself. A blessing - calm before the storm. Since I've been to Cleveland before, I wanted to find a new place to try within reasonable walking distance of my downtown hotel. It also had to be reasonable in price, since I planned to dine out with friends on other nights and had to make my per diem stretch. 

Taza fit the bill - less than - 10 min walk and a very filling dinner, along with beer, for $18 including tip. 

I sat at the bar so I could enjoy a book and chatting with the staff. Everyone was super friendly and checked on me frequently. The beer - a Lebanese brand - was the bartender's recommendation. Nice, light and refreshing. 

A basket of warm bread came out for snacking, along with a dish of sesame oil for dipping.

I ordered a hummus and falafel toasted rolled pita. It came with a side of homemade fries. The pita was super crunchy in the inside but tender (especially the falafel...which I appreciated because who likes dry falafel?) on the inside. 

I had a choice of Turkish coffee or baklava (or both) courtesy of my Yelp checkin. I opted for baklava only - a girl's gotta sleep. The baklava was ladyfinger style and beautifully presented with drizzled honey and pistachio dust. 

Taza was an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"We had a seriously delicious meal here. The baba was grilled deliciousness, and the garlic sauce on the side of the plates was amazing. I would absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"I have been to both Taza locations and was impressed by both. The spicy hummus is probably the best I have ever tasted. It is so creamy and delicious that I am afraid that it might actually be lard  :)

The only bad thing about this place is that the freshly baked pillowy bread they serve is so delicious, you'll find yourself sheepishly accepting basket after basket of it, only to find that you no longer have room for your amazing entree!

I have tasted many things on the menu, and the falafel and hummus pita is my favorite. The falafels are humongous!

The service is great, and there are great happy hour specials ($4 mojitos!). If you are lucky, you'll get Kicksy as your waitress - she is the absolute best!!

I just talked myself into a five star review, and my mouth is literally watering, thinking about the hummus and baba!"}
{"text":"Really great place! Came here for dinner after having a not so lovely wait at another restaurant down by the water. I sat outside and got the Schawarma meal. Got bread, a full meal, a free Turkish coffee and baklava from a yelp-check-in. Service was quick and with a smile. There was nice live music being played out on the street. The food was a good portion even for the small size,flavorful, but clean and healthy. Definitely worth my $12!"}
{"text":"While I love Aladdin's and Sittoo's, Taza fell flat for me.

This place was dead when I stopped in with a friend on a Thursday evening.  So dead there was maybe 10 patrons in the whole restaurant.  Which should have meant that since there were so few people needing to be served, the service was going to be great. Not so much.  When we walked in we waited by the hostess desk for almost 5 minutes before someone acknowledged us, even though there was clearly a server/hostess/bartender leaning on the bar 5 feet in front of us playing on her phone.  She never even looked up.

When we were finally sat, our server promptly came over and greeted us and took our drink order.  We placed our drinks and appetizers right away since we've eaten here before.  FYI - go for the spicy hummus, its deliciously tasty with just the right amount of heat.  After we received our hummus and veggie plate we went ahead and ordered our mains - beef shawarma roll for me and falafel for my friend.  Both meals came out quickly and piping hot. The shawarma was tasty, however the fries were a little soggy (which I think is weird to serve in an upscale mediterranean place). The falafel was delicious like usual and is always a safe staple order.  It took a while to get our drinks refilled after we asked and we had to ask for additional pita when our basket was empty, neither were filled automatically which is disappointing.

While the food here is great and those puffed pitas are like little clouds of heaven.  The service and price just doesn't justify coming here when there are better options out there including the sister restaurants Aladdin's and Sittoo's."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful ambiance in a cool part of town, decent prices. The falafel was delicious and would recommend as an app. I got the shawarma fetta for the entree. Interesting combo, but yummy.. we also got a free baklava and Turkish coffee from them as part of checking in on yelp that I was really looking forward to- baklava was hard and not fresh unfortunately."}
{"text":"I had never tasted Lebanese food before. The hummus and fresh baked bread were amazing! I didn't like the grape leaves, however. My Entree was the Shish Kebab. It came with rice and vegetables. It was excellent!! I liked the tahini sauce on the beef. The cinnamon on the rice was a nice touch. Our waitress was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful experience. Shoutout to the owner and Madelyn (might have misspelled her name) for the amazing service and complimentary baklava!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, lots of choices, and pleasant no-rush-to-leave service. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Menu seems promising. French fries and cilantro potatoes were amazing however all the meat entrees we got were off. We went sort of an odd time around 330 and our waitress let us know that the cook said to give him a break and he's tired of cooking. She then proceeded to tell us she's been on her feet all day and needs a break herself. All of this happened before we received our food and she just kind of said it as she was setting down the waters. We were confused, did they not want our service or what? Anyways maybe the meat didn't taste good since the cook obviously didn't want to be there but wouldn't try it again!"}
{"text":"I've been disappointed by a lot of the downtown Cleveland restaurants, but my first visit to Taza was a delight. It was too cold to sit on their outdoor patio so I ate inside. The decor is a very pleasant Middle Eastern motif without getting hokey. The menu has the usual Middle Eastern dishes. Wanting to try several things, I went for the mixed grill number 1. In addition to grilled vegetables, it was served with \"Lebanese rice\" (kind of rice pilaf with pinenuts) and both garlic and tahini sauce. The grill included lamb kebab, chicken kebab, and beef kafta (which is kind of like a cross between a spiced hamburger and a beef sausage). Everything was cooked perfectly and spiced very nicely. For dessert I had a baklava and Turkish coffee. With a glass of Turkish wine, the check (I was eating alone) came to $39 including tax. Quite reasonable. If you like Middle Eastern food, I'd recommend this place. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Great Food. The Baba was fantastic. Hasan did a great job. Service was awesome. Everyone was super friendly."}
{"text":"Worth the brisk and cold walk all the way from the Residence Inn....even a San Franciscan said so (who kept asking if we were there yet!). Could eat here everyday!! Shawarma sharwarma sharwarma! Get there before 7 for happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Lovely hostess and waitress. Very helpful and enthusiastic about the food. Salmon was cooked to perfection and the rice was very flavorful. Never had Lebanese stuffed grape leaves before; loved em."}
{"text":"I can't help but love this place, because I went on my first real date with the man of my dreams here. ;) 

BUT, they have great food. Although, its no better than any other Lebanese Restaurant... Cedarland is equally good. However... it is a much better atmosphere. Clean, upscale... if a tad bit overpriced. Good place for a date, for sure. And their food is spot on."}
{"text":"Great food. We had the shish kabob salad and hummos swarma and they were delicious!! You've also got to try the garlic sauce with the shish kabob, it is a match made in heaven! And to top off the perfect meal, their baklava (especially the lady finger one) is super crunchy and amazing. Can't say enough about this awesome place!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Taza on a Monday night! The decor was great. Our server was very attentive. I ordered the Lebanese cheese as a starter it was interesting with its pomegranate sauce and pistachio dust, it was a nice way to start my first Lebanese food experience. I ordered the beef kafta pita roll, which was recommended by another yelp reviewer. Excellent choice the meat was moist with a lot of different herbs and spices. My friend and I checked in and got Turkish coffee and two pieces of baklava, each, what a perfect way to end the night. Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"5 stars for interior design. Great execution of theme here. Was quickly addressed by two hostesses to seat us. We opted for the outdoor patio given the weather was permitting. I ordered the chicken fattoush salad which was a generous portion. Grilled chicken was moist and not super charred. Remaining salad ingredients were fresh and flavorful: lemon, pita chips, olives. To wash it down, I had a sangria which was nice and light. Alcohol was not overbearing and I could definitely taste fruit.

Parking: either valet or find street parking, free after 6:30 or on weekends."}
