{"text":"Great food! The salsa is so darn hot it's not enjoyable and I love me some spicy food but that's not humane ;) I just ate the BEST CHILE RELLENO I have ever eaten in my life. The service sucks. The staff are occupied in their own lives and just as the other yelpers have stated the sit you down, take your order and that's that. And pay time comes they expect tips, kinda reminds me of the Asian places you eat at where they seat you and don't attend to you but when it's time to pay they are right there ready to collect. This place is a must try at least once as this is my second time and both trips were delicious! Happy eating."}
{"text":"Great Hot Sauce if you like it (HOT)!....I have eaten here more than half a dozen times and what I have eaten is good, but you are made to sit and then order from a waitress who once has served you doesn't seem to know you are still a guest.  It seems from my experience that you are only made to sit down instead of go to the counter to order is so you will feel like you need to leave a tip before you leave. The problem is however the atmosphere feels more like some of the other BETTER MEXICAN food places to choose from in the area where you can order at the counter and then are able to eat in or take your food out.    For a so called sit down restaurant where atmosphere and service should but are not part of the deal, this place gets about  1/2 a star from me.  I will add that for food quality alone I could go as high as four stars but for the reasons already stated along with the higher prices one has to pay for what this place has to offer by comparison to so many better choices this place overall gets just 2 STARS from me."}
{"text":"\"Sit down\" mexican restaurant open 24 hours?? This place is awesome! Good food, nice ambiance-its like going to Mexico. Fun place. Best plate of food after bein out at the bars youll ever have! Hot AF salsa : )"}
{"text":"Esta puta comida sabe a mierda literalmente  Ala madre  La torta sabe bien fea y bien salada"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not the best I've had & not the worst. I won't be coming here again tho I don't like that they charge a gratuity on to the bill and a $6 one at that. When I leave a tip & I always do it depends on how you serve & so on. Tips are not mandatory you get paid to serve & if you go above & beyond it's the customers choice to tip you."}
{"text":"Who ever gave this place a 2 1/2 star is crazy. This place is amazing I love their Gorditas. If you want authentic Mexican come here! I never had real Mexican food until I came to this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This is the closest you'll get to having real mexican food w/o going to Mexico. Staff is awesome! New favorite mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and while driving by, their sign caught my attention and decided to stop by and give them a try. Their claim of having the best tacos de Cabeza al vapor is not quite there, then again, compared to what and according to whose palate. Although I've travelled all over the American Continent, my tongue may also be off from time to time. But not on tacos,  I'm always down for tacos, especially los de cabeza. In my humble opinion NOTHING COMPARES to the ones served throughout Old Mexico. However, we are also talking about different ingredients. From the flavor of the tortilla, the gentle dipping into fatty substances to enhance the flavor, the special meat with  a little extra \"marveling\", onions, cilantro, limon and the unique salsa; made with GREEN TOMATILLO and Serrano or Jalapeño chiles. NOT red, NOT pinkish or brownish, GREEN!! . The salsa verde IS extremely essential for a great taco de cabeza, and this is where \"Taqueria El Vaporcito\" failed miserably.  It is very evident they do not know this. They use an habanero based salsa that completely eliminates any flavorful goodness their tacos may have. Yes it is hot, so what!  Salsa does not need to be extremely hot to be good but it does have to complement the dish being served on and, thanks to Mother Nature, if it happens to be hot, then the more the merrier. They do have a good potential of being better than those in the immediate area however, they may have to rethink their salsa pairing in order to stay ahead, no pun intended. Oh, and maybe take time to listen when a customer asks for 2 tacos instead of 4... Good luck!"}
{"text":"Know your audience.  Also know where you are.  This place Rocks!! It is authentic and they don't try to pretend to be anything else but great Mexican food.  Spicy food here is not for the weak.  If you want exquisite service and fancy plates this is not for you.   I love the authentic barbacoa and the habanero sauce.  Both green and red.   Connected to a latino nightclub, this restaurant can be loud and quite interesting at times.  Open 24 hours.  For a fun and delicious adventurewit hout leaving Phoenix, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service!! We heard the tacos were great, but never had a chance to try! They forgot about us after 45min!! Will NEVER RETURN!!"}
{"text":"Not Grigo Friendly here -nothing is worse than bad food ! I want to take this back and have the Chef have a big  bite- taste if i knew what dried up dog shit taste like I image this is what it would taste like - chorizo burnt to black so cant eat it cant take it back my is dry and have bad after taste now I put you in category with Filibertos , and any other shitabertos - thier food taste like they don't clean grill or oil in deep fryer typical for Az taco shops - so i am eliminating this restaurant now on journey to look for new breakfast burrito place, any suggestions - These owners don't get that the Gringo market is massive just be nice polite cook your food good don't burn it - the chefs looks at who is ordering food here - when you cook you know when your food is burnt especially when it is literally black. this damm after taste still here while i am typing this really ruined my morning good breakfast makes your day,"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Went back to give this place another shot. Same outcome. Food had flavor however they always mess up the order. First time they put pico de gallo on the tacos and gave me the wrong type of meat on my tacos. After telling them they messed up my order and walked her through it again she said it would take 25 mi Minutes and the place was empty.  Today I went back to order a burrito with rice,beans and cilantro and onions. They forgot the rice and charged me 2.50 for it. The servers are rude and no matter what language whether it is Spanish or English they don't get it right. Sorry I'm here to order food no one is trying to hit on you just get the order right. LOL. For 9.58 I could go up the street to chipotle and get a bigger burrito for 2 more dollars and walk out satisfied with the service and the food.  I'm sorry but I can be very patient as I was once a server and a busser but there are hard working people in the establishment trying to eat at least give them great service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, food quality has not improved. Service seems to be better. Hit or miss most of the time."}
{"text":"I came one day and bought 4 tacos and a michelada and it was all good, I decided to come for the second time, I am 21, I did have my ID but all of a sudden they decided not to serve me a beer because \"I looked to young\" I had my ID! Then they questioned that it was fake?! That was insulting. So they decided that because I look to young, even though I'm 21, I can't have a beer. Never coming here again. That's insulting and discriminating!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Everything I've tried at Taqueria Vaporcito is awesome and the salsa compliments their food perfectly. The mesa location is also very good, but nothing beats the original."}
{"text":"I almost died of their HOT salsa but their Michelada, carne asada tacos and coconut shrimp cocktail was good. Definitely will come back and have everything with out their hot salsa."}
{"text":"I just wish Mexican Cuisine, which is my native Cuisine would be more refine.  By that I mean, use better oils, less oil and lighter ingredients.  The flavor of the food is there, but its just too heavy, the salsa both of the that were provided (green and red) were both way to hot to enjoy.  I like hot, I am from Mexico city, but you have to have a really hot option and a normal hot option.  I will start rewarding Mexican Restaurants that transform the recipes  but keep the awesome flavor of Real Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"Ordered a al pastor burrito and I have no idea what they gave me.  Was a soggy mess with chucks of what looked carne asada.  But definitely wasn't al pastor.  Lucky for them in was in a hurry cause of work and couldn't go back and get my money back.  I would not recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I liked this place until the day i was served in a dirty plate with a dirty fork. It looked like they just soaked the fork and plate and the food just dried on to. It was gross i never went back. Come to find out they had to close it for some time for not passing a health inspection. Wasn't surprised!"}
{"text":"This was not a true taqueria. First off no onions available for the tacos, no jalapeños, no cilantro, no salsa, you ask for pollo tacos they give you these cheap corn tortillas with shredded chicken. Wtf is that... I originally asked for shrimp and they were gonna charge me $13 for 2 shrimp... Again wtf...um no thanks. Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Places a to go order over the phone so when I would arrive it would be ready when I arrive I find out they never even placed my order when asked why the gal told me because they don't know if I was going to come...wtf kind of answer is that? I placed an order because I didn't want to wait"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious and the servers are cool. I recommend this place, specially after a long night dancing at the club; they are open until late. :)  Its a little hard to have a conservation when next door (part of the same business) have a karaoke night. But other than that I like it."}
{"text":"The food isn't that great, canned beans and no flavor Carne asada. Horchata out the foutnain? SMH...  My buddy was also disappointed who I met up there. I won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Si pudiera darle zero Estrella lo haría. Este pasado fin de semana después del baile fuimos a cenar al Vaporcito. Yo ordene una Coca Cola de envase que si me sirvieron. Estando la botella en mi mano, pasó una mesera que no era la mía y me la quitó de la mano diciendo que nuestra mesera se había equivocado y me dio la última coca que tenían de envase y era suya.  Me quito la soda de la mano!!! Y no se la dio a su cliente porque obvio ya le había tomado yo.. pero con tal de ser el mal. La manger vino a disculparse pero creo que de la vergüenza que nos hizo para esta mesera, deberían de haber echo más para remediar el mal rato. La mesera despota al menos hubiera dado la cara y disculparse con nosotros."}
{"text":"I would definitely say the food wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either.the best thing this restaurant has the advantage is that it's open 24 hrs. I would say if it's 2 am and I am hungry and there's no alternative yes I would go back no question asked."}
{"text":"Yo comí unos torito y fue una cochinada estaban muy grasosos y mi estomago me sigue doliendo ni loco como ahí de nuevo"}
{"text":"This place used to be on of my favorite we were there yesterday after going to the club and drinking so everyone asked me where is a good place to eat around 2:30 am so I said el vaporcito is the best  We waited close to 1 hour to have a seat another 45 minutes for our food,when I got my food was cold and I got my tortilla with my check to pay don't know what really happened to this place and don't care not coming back"}
{"text":"I went to this place for a late breakfast. i was craving some menudo. but when i looked at the menu i sooo wanted to change my mind. some of their tacos and buritos looked so delicious. but i stuck with the menudo. boy i was not disapointed. this was one of first times i took a sip without adding anything. and it was perfect. well seasoned. i just added the norm some lemon and cilantro. the only thing was i would have liked more meat in my bowl. other than that i will return."}
{"text":"I had the ceviche and it was top notch! Very authentic! They also have a mariachi band the plays Fridays 7:30-9:30. They're awesome!   I say it's worth a go!"}
{"text":"This is like one of the only restaurants who's dining hall is open 24 hours. By the time I get there, it's already mid morning hours and inside is basically empty except maybe people that are from the clubs and bars. The place is clean and the police are always there lately night at the nearby Subway sandwich shop and QT next door.   The wait staff are easy going. I've gotten take out and eaten inside. I've been pretty pleased with both. The bathrooms are clean. The food comes out relatively fast. The food is pretty good. Their salsa is very spicy which, is one of the best things I like about the food here. The pricing is decent. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago after reading the reviews. .. it was good. .. I wouldn't say it's the best. .. for carne asada I had better. .. The ceviche Tostadas were pretty good. .  The salsa it's not the best for chips. . It's too hot hard to enjoy. ...  This is not a place were 2 eat for $20... more like $35 + tip.  I will go back if I'm on the area,  but I won't drive that far just for that."}
{"text":"I went there late last night, first of all I was very pleased to find it open at 2 am. I love tacos de buche and lengua, so I ordered one taco de buche first to see first...OMG!! The best tacos de buche ever, so I ordered two more, but this time I asked for the buche to be a bit crispy..WOW...you have to try them, then I had two Angus beef tacos and the beef just melted in your mouth.  They are not the cheapest tacos, but the premium quality of the beef is top notch.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I like this place and typically stop in for a quick lunch when working in the area.  The hot sauce is hot so be careful before using too much.  The chili Colorado is my fave dish here."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and kids. I'm only giving it 2 stars because the food was alright but the service was sad. Our waitress forgot about us after the noon rush."}
{"text":"You can go to this place to eat, or you can go for the nightlife. The food is acceptable and at times, delicious. Prices are reasonable. The fact that this place is open all the time also makes it a great spot for the post-bar drunk munchies.   The bar side of this place is more fun for me, though. There is really fun karaoke and a little dance floor. The DJ is pretty decent. Men are overall respectful and there's a good mix of couples, younger people, older people, and single people. Seating space is plentiful. One drawback is that you can't have a tab open and they charge you drinks one by one, but the waitress will bring the bill so besides signing a bunch of receipts it's not a huge inconvenience. There is security out front who pat people down and check purses which is great."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this.  This place has become our weekend hang-out.  The friends and I love this place for more than one reason. #1.  Great tacos #2 Great customer service, the waitresses go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need.  #3 EXCELLENT KARAOKE from Wednesday-Sunday!!! We can sing all night long to pretty much anything we want.   If you want to go to a restaurant, eat some good food and have a great time, then this is the place right here!!!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"food was just OK prices were extremely high for portion sizes i went there with my husband and 3 kids we were charged a 18%gratuity when i asked the waitress why she said oh we charge 18 % when its more than 5 ppl i said we are 5 ppl she said oh i mean 5 ppl or more which is REDIC...was not worth a 19 dollar tip will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"After a long night out at casino and dancing, me and my family HAD to stop to enjoy some of the best tacos de carne Asada!  first time that I have gone there and will for now continue! The waitress was nice and she was quick with our orders being taken, as well as bringing them to our table! And although it was like 4am, the vibe of everyone there was still on a roll!"}
{"text":"5.25 for guacamole and it doesn't include chips!  Need I say more? Okay I will... Greedy. Tacos are good but expensive. Service is slow and by not so friendly staff. We've been here a few times but today was our last. Can't support this type of business."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and read this review entirely. I am not that person that is critical about everything like some no offense I am the most patient and understanding person you will probably meet but today was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. The claim they have the best tacos in Arizona  they have the worst tacos and service in Arizona. My family placed an order with the waitress our drinks came quickly however never brought me drink. Placed our food order 40 minutes later we noticed clients who got their after us had their drinks and food eating the \"best tacos in Arizona\" . We asked where our order was another waitress was confused and took our order again quickly realizing they messed up they rushed our food out with a vampiro with unmelted cheese !? Oh and someone else's torta to name a few. Then the first waitress decides to lie to our faces and tell us our order was placed the first time!? Like really? Everyone makes mistakes but you decide to lie after you messed up!? I had it there $50 for the worst tacos and service in Arizona. Don't get screwed like my family did by these people. The least I can do is inform people who may pay your bills not to because this place is the WORST I've ever had no exaggeration.   PS if you mess up own up to it the customer wants to hear the truth and an apology to say the least! Don't be prideful and and make yourself and the business look beyond bad."}
