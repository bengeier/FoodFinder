{"text":"In Cleveland on a business trip and needed a quick place to eat and enjoy. The teriyaki combo was tasty"}
{"text":"Good concept, bad execution. Bland rice, small portions for the price. Doesn't feel authentic. However, the bubble tea is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place.  The bubble tea is excellent, and the sushi is pretty good (though not excellent)."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a coincidence, but I got sick about 2 hours after eating here. I noticed the chicken on my rice bowl didn't taste good (on top of being over cooked, it tasted off/bad), so I stopped eating it. But apparently not soon enough.  :(. The rest of the bowl was good, and the service was great. They were all pleasant and patient."}
{"text":"Great bubble tea but sushi was really disappointing. The rolls were tasteless and there was way too much sauce. I would not go back!"}
{"text":"We had a geat time. Make your own style. There were lots of options. Everything was fresh. They had reasonable prices. The bubble tea on point. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki bowl is amazing!!!! And you can DIY your own sushi. Although It is not authentic Japanese food, but very good!!! Definitely come back. The environment is very cool and nice too"}
{"text":"Food tastes fine. however who ever came up with pricing only cares about making money and none about service.   sauces cost 50 cents? adding anything, changing anything, however minor will cost you money. wow. extremely stingy.  if u eat here once in a while u won't mind. however big turn down for regular customers."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken and fried rice are delicious. Portions are large, even though they don't look like it. Prices are only so-so. Atmosphere is excellent (though kinda hipster), and wait time is short."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in cleveland. The chicken teriyaki bowl is delicious. Sushi is okay."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, while the attached bubble tea is great, the food here is mediocre at best. Sushi meat is not fresh, and portions are small. I also ordered the beef and chicken teriyaki, which was relatively flavorless. The included vegetables were also lackluster and a bit soggy. If you come here for bubble tea, try to grab your food somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times now and enjoy the sushi, but have experienced one reoccurring and very frustrating problem.   Every time I have been here I get the same worker that makes my sushi, and he finishes my roll before I'm done saying what I want in it. Every time I have said the first 3 things I want in my roll and then pause so he can catch up with my order, but then he instantly seals the roll before I can tell him I wasn't finished. I have said I wasn't finished and I wanted more in it, but he stares at my with a blank expression and then passes it on to be cut. I have yet to have a roll here with everything I want in it. Similar to chipolte, I would hope they would have trained their workers to ask \"is this all you'd like?\" before they assume you're done with your order.  Other than this, the sushi is good quality and the bubble tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"I only had a boba drink, but I was truly impressed! The tea can be personalized in terms of sweetness and ice, which is a huge plus and was perfectly flavored. The boba was perfectly chewy. This place definitely blew my Cleveland expectations out of the water."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, love the tea.  Great value for the price.  I am not a huge fan of the teriyaki bowls, but the build your own sushi and awesome selection of bubble tea. Great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Being able to build your own sushi is great and all the ingredients are fresh. The bubble teas are also delightful; the lychee tea has actual lychee at the bottom and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Never had sushi burrito (burrito) before. Very interesting and definitely tasty. Went in around noon and you can see how fresh the ingredients were. Very modern and trendy feel.  The self order stations are also very nice  Would go again, and again and again."}
{"text":"Soooo good! So many kinds of bubble tea and all the kinds I've had so far were soooo delicious! The sushi is also really good! I really really like the kenko roll! My one complaint is that it is a bit pricey. Kenko roll is around $11 and bubble tea is $4. That being said, treat yourself every once in a while!"}
{"text":"5 stars for bubble tea. I come here often just for boba and it's great!!    3 stars for sushi. The make your own sushi is fun and affordable, however the portions are small and the sushi isn't great quality   1 star for the teriyaki bowls. They don't have much flavor or sauce.. and the bowl is about 70% rice"}
{"text":"Great concept - it's the Chipotle of sushi.  The front counter guys were enthusiastic and helpful.  They made the sushi rolls right in front of us.  The sauce names needed some explanation and the crew needed to confer as to what each one really tasted like, but not that big of a deal.  Plenty of seating tonight, even for a Wade Oval Wednesday. I thought the price was good for how much food we received. Overall, I recommend giving it a try before it becomes too popular to get in."}
{"text":"Made-to-order custom sushi rolls with bubble tea is good. If you want more, get teriyaki rice. The bubble tea girl there is cute too."}
{"text":"My dad and I stumbled upon Kenko before seeing the Cleveland Orchestra to get a bite to eat before the concert. OHMYGOD was it amazing! First off, when you came into the restaurant, they had iPads that you could order your food and pay without talking to a cashier, which is nice if you don't necessarily like talking to someone to order your food, like me. The food was also ready very fast so there was very little wait time. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with fried rice and saut√©ed mushrooms and it was heavenly. The portions they gave you were huge so you could save the rest for leftovers. I got their miso soup as well and that was also very good.  I am so glad that my dad and I found this place and I am positive that I will come again next time I visit Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars for their bubble tea, but 3 stars for the food. I've been searching for good bubble tea since I did my clinical in DC 9 years ago. It's taken me 9 years to find bubble tea this good! LOVE it. They make their bobas there on the spot, and the tea is real tea; no artificial flavored powders.  I also tried their sushi and a teriyaki bowl. The sushi was just ok, not great, not awful. The teriyaki bowl was very tasty, but I thought the portion was small for the price.  Will I buy sushi here again? Probably not, but I'll definitely go back for the tea."}
{"text":"I've come here many times before, but I won't go again. I asked that milk be left out of my ginger tea and he insisted that they would not. His employees would have done it and have done it for me before, but despite the fact that for medical reasons, I can't have milk he refused to allow them to leave it out of my tea. This kind of rigidity will not bode well for future business. The reason Chipotle has been successful isn't because their burritos are all the same. It's because they tailor their options to the individual consumer. If the manager doesn't understand that, he should not be the manager."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints about this place. They are always very friendly and the service is excellent. I haven't tried their bowls yet but I'm there at least 3 times a week for sushi. I like the fact that I am able to create it myself. If you like sushi you have to try it."}
{"text":"by far, the worst sushi place i have tried in the recent years.. let me tell u why  i believe to make a good sushi roll, u really need to have good sushi rice.. and i never notice the seaweed wrapper is that important until i tried its sushi here..i dont think i have been to any sushi place that would mess up their seaweed wrapper  why the rice ruined my appetite here bc the traditional sushi rice would add rice vinegar but the sushi rice they use is just plain rice and somewhat sticky.. a good sushi rice u would taste the vinegar and the rice would not be mushy.. i find it to be disappointing .  the ingredients are alright.. nothing outstanding..   the seaweed wrapper is hard to chew   i like the idea of each customer gets to choose its sushi roll ingredient.. from wrapper, rice, protein, sauce, and toppings.. but i am disappointed at the quality of sushi this place delivers"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have had proper bubble tea in Cleveland,if your searching for it you have found it here. (RIP turbo4 tea cafe)   There are no flavored powders used here, it's a proper green or black tea with pearls that are perfectly cooked and properly seasoned.   They have a great selection of items to choose from, I have tried a amazing half sweetened black milk tea but my favorite is the lychee punch with bubbles. So amazing, it comes with ground up lychee in it as well.   I think I'm about to head down there now and get one :)"}
{"text":"Some where a sushi master (Itamae) is rolling in his grave.  The sushi is average at best.  The concept is chipotle style for sushi.  It's good if you have a look at the menu before you order (wrap,rice,protein,veggies, sauces, and toppings).  You can alway order the usually rolls like spicy tuna, California, spider, etc. If you have never had sushi then go with someone who knows because there is no descriptions on the menu. So they have a machine that puts a even thin layer of rice on the nori (seaweed wrap) then employee makes your roll.  We went in unprepared to make our own, so we just got a spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll with a side of ginger and wasabi-- you have to ask for it.  To drink we got a Taro Kung Fu Slush and the Kung Fu Bubble tea.  Two things about the rolls.  The nori was really  chewy and the roll was very unevenly cut- some pieces were small and some you would choke on. Both teas were excellent!!  There was a  log jam of people waiting for their drinks to be made-- kind of like Starbucks but way worse.  It's a new restaurant hopefully they will iron out these minor problems.  I will go back....  UPDATE- Two days later we went back.  They have a machine that cuts the rolls.  They probably weren't using it because they were so busy!"}
{"text":"This place is cool, but be willing to spend more than $20 per person if you want the full experience. Kung Fu Tea is a must, check out the Top 10 if you're hesitant or just can't decide. Teriyaki bowls are very similar to what you would get at a Sakkio Japan, good, not great. Also be prepared to add on some addition up- charges. Lots of good starters to choose from, and the create- your- own sushi is tasty and convenient, but no match for a sushi connoisseur. Spend some time looking over the menu before ordering and you're sure to have a good experience!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good. It's clean inside. I got a two item bowl and was $12 but well worth it"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to eat at. fast, delicious, and convenient . Ate here once a week for a few months while visiting the hospital next door ."}
{"text":"The sushi is about grocery store quality but the fact you can customize it or deep fry it makes it better.  If you're used to spending a lot of money on sushi at high end restaurants, you will be disappointed. However, the set up is brilliant. It's chipotle style and theres a lot of choices for a low price (about the same as the grocery store).  I can't remember everything but they had cooked and raw options as well as tofu.  I got shrimp tempura, green onions, avocado, tobiko, and spicy mayo.  My partner got salmon, asparagus, avocado, fried onions, and miso sauce.  She commented that she didn't prefer sushi that has the seaweed on the outside, but that didn't bother me.  We both thought our meals were ok and we agreed to definitely come back to try more things.  The drink menu is extensive and overwhelming if you're not familiar with all the different kinds of teas.  My partner ordered the passionfruit slush and she loved it, I tried to be adventurous and order some grapfruit yogurt thing, but they didn't have it so I ordered the honey lemonade, which was perfect.  The people who work there are very friendly and helpful and the place has a good vibe and comfy seating.  I can't wait to come back to try a rice bowl and a different drink. I will probably post an updated review."}
{"text":"The bubble tea tastes good, but people should be aware when ordering at the \"bubble tea\" kiosk that it does *not* automatically come with the \"bubbles\" - - the little tapioca pearls that are an integral part of bubble tea. You have to request them separately and pay extra."}
{"text":"I got the tuna poke bowl with fresh tuna and spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, asparagus, tempura flakes and spicy mayo. It was delicious and fresh tasting. Portion is a little too small they should really make them more similar in size to the teriyaki bowls sizes. It totally worth it, I enjoyed the bowl very much. The teriyaki was not as enjoyable, it was ok but reminded me of food court stir fry from the mall with grisly chicken. The sushirito is wonderful too."}
{"text":"How have I never had bubble tea before!?!?!  This stuff is amazing.  I will totally be going back to try all the flavors.  I got the oolong milk tea this time. The beef and chicken teriyaki bowl was good too but I'm wasn't sure what I was supposed to do with the mayo-ish yum yum sauce since it didn't seem to fit the meal. The tea is what I will definitely be going back for."}
{"text":"meh. not many options for vegetarians, drinks are way too sweet and the sushi prep is sloppy.  nothing to see here... move on"}
{"text":"The boba is literally addictive. I think I come here at least 3-4 times a week and I'm not ashamed of it at all. No shame for good food.   The milk teas have the right balance of milk, teas and the level of sweetness and ice can be adjusted to individual preference. The bubbles are chewy and tender. Perfectly cooked every time!  Only complaint is that they're so busy, sometimes it may take a little while for you to get your Order. Best advice is to ad void the lunch crowd so you can get your boba fast."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying the bubble tea is OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! I've had bubble tea from California to Chinatown in NYC and this is the best bubble tea I've ever had, hands down. The coconut milk tea with boba is amaze-balls (see what I did there?) and I couldn't leave without ordering a couple more to take home with me. The place is setup in such a way that you can place an order at an iPad and pay for it then simply wait for them to call your name or you can place your order with the cashier.  The sushi is made a la Chipotle style (in front of you, to order) and I thought it was quite delicious for being quick casual sushi albeit a tad pricey. We ordered a build your own roll, a specialty roll and 2 bubble teas and it was nearly $30 (Eeek!). The interior is very zen like, light woods and clean lines and bright. Judging by the crowd of what seemed to be college kids, this place is definitely popular amongst their demographic.   I will definitely be back to slowly work my way through the entire bubble tea menu and grab a roll while I'm at it!"}
{"text":"I've never tried the sushi here, but the teriyaki bowls are bomb dot com!! I always get the chicken teriyaki. It comes in a huge portion! The chicken is very tender and savory. The sauce is what tops it off! It's like a thousand island dressing but much better!! Treat yourself by getting the teriyaki bowl and a delicious cup of bubble tea!! The bubble tea here is so so so good! I recommend the green or black milk tea with tapioca, half ice and 75% sugar! You cannot go wrong with this order :)"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea on the east side (if not all of Cleveland)! I like that you can customize it in terms of how much ice or sugar you want. There are lots of flavor options too. It would be even better if they had more topping options (such as aloe or the small cubes of jelly, which is not the jelly that they serve here)."}
{"text":"Pretty average. It's nice that you can customize your roll, but also kind of ridiculous to pay $8 for one roll when there are much better (and cheaper) options in the area. Still a fun place to go, but you're going more for the novelty than really good sushi."}
{"text":"First time customer. Before placing my order we asked if they use chicken breast for the teriyaki plate and they said yes - it wasn't. Also, found the food too greasy for our taste.  Clean environment. Better than average decor and loud music forcing you to yell at your companion."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place! There are endless sushi-bilities since you can choose your own ingredients! My personal favorite is spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, and cream cheese, with kiwi and spicy mayo on top! They fill it, roll it, and slice it right in front of you!  I also had never tried KungFu Tea before, but it is great! The bubbles tasted like gummy bears! I will definitely be coming back!  Also, there are really cool machines to help make the food and such! They have this machine which spreads the sushi rice on the seaweed! They also have these machines which shake the teas, and another which seals your drinks so they don't spill. This is probably the most useful machine I've seen relating to drinks and I think all restaurants should have it!"}
{"text":"Holy hell. I am thrilled. Kung fu tea has come to cleveland. 200+ dollars of airfare no more, kung fu tea is finally relatively close to home. At first I was a bit nervous from the fear that the tea wouldn't taste the same, but rest assured, this tea tastes ducking awesome. There's a lot of selections since the menu is the same for all kft chain stores, and I look forward to having more! The service was great, and I hope this place can prosper on ;) I can't say anything for the sushi though, since I haven't tried anything yet, but there is always a next time! See you soon kftea."}
{"text":"Yoooo Kenko sushi is a pretty big waste of time. I was going to the art museum tonight and looked to Yelp for a recommendation on where to eat close by. Was very dissapointed with the fact that most people who left reviews for this place don't seem to have taste buds. I got a teriyaki bowl with tofu on which they didn't even use teriyaki sauce? And the tofu was terrible. Didn't even eat more than half. No rating on customer service since I used an ipad to order. They played bass heavy club music . One pro is they had the Cavs game on and we were killin' the game."}
{"text":"I'm really hot and cold about this place. On the one hand, it's just so convenient - around the corner from campus, equipped with Wi-Fi, lots of outlets, efficient ordering process, and a trendy vibe. On the other, the sushi is well... Dare I even call it sushi? I'm not expecting Jiro-level quality at a fast food dig, but I created my own roll once and probably will never do it here again. Mushy, lackluster ingredients and disappointing portion size. I have yet to order a bowl here, but maybe stir-fried food is a little more reliable.   Since I mainly only come for the drinks, I really appreciate that there's an electronic ordering system that allows you to skip whatever food line may be building up. Credit or debit only for these machines. Kung-Fu tea is a relatively small national chain that seems to be known for their Golden Oolong tea in my hometown in the SF Bay Area. I find that the drinks here definitely trend towards the sweeter side and that the traditional tea-centered flavors are more to my taste. Except the Chai, which does not taste like chai tea at all but a sugary green tea. Nonetheless, I find myself returning here to get plain tea and enjoying a few hours of their surprisingly good (EDM) playlist while studying. Others will find solace in the large flatscreen TVs mounted on the wall, from which cushy booths offer the optimal viewing position."}
{"text":"I loved it. Fresh and made to order.  I like the soy wrap.  Get the Ohio roll. Go every week. A little pricey for eat and go."}
{"text":"The pokey bowl is like a \"make your own sushi roll, but in a bowl\"   Everything is made to order and taste great. Definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I was confused at first there is 2 didn't sides to the store. One side is for sushi only and the other side for the other food. So I was standing in the Sushi line for 5 minutes until it was time to order.  That's when the cashier told me I was in the wrong line Lol. The prices are okay not to special. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit so I played it safe with a traditional California roll. It was awesome to watch them make it right in front of me. My friend got the chicken teriyaki bowl with mushrooms. It looked and smelled delicious! I'll definitely try one next time because I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with some friends at Kenko today, after hearing the hype about the boba and the sushi options. Seating area is large and very comfortable. Very busy lunch rush just after 12pm, that thinned out considerably by 1pm.   Build your own sushi is actually very reasonable, fresh, and quick. The roll I had was delicious (seaweed wrapper, white rice, crab, pickle, avocado, seaweed powder, yum yum sauce) and took a minute or two, no complaints there.   However, my friend and I also opted to try one of Kenko's teriyaki bowls--I had the beef with brown rice (extra yum yum sauce), my friend the shrimp with white rice. The meat itself was well-seasoned and the yum yum sauce (a ranchy spicy mayo) addictive. The brown rice, however, was overcooked and watery.   The kitchen and front end were quite disorganized and we waited at least 15 minutes for our bowls, while our friends waited for us with their sushi at our table. They're still a new place and have some kinks to work out in terms of moving things along, but the food has promise. Will be back for the sushi, maybe not for the teriyaki bowls, and definitely to try some boba!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I definitely wanted to stop here for the bubble drinks. I love the fact that they make their own boba in the store. We ordered the milk bubble tea w coconut and the taro slush. Both delicious. I was in Malaysia in the summer and drank a lot of bubble tea but Kenko's was better."}
{"text":"Came here to make some photocopies. They don't even do that. So why are they called Kinko's? False advertising.  One of the most popular sushi places in Eastern Cleveland. Definitely Americanized to a large degree, but not as shockingly overpriced as a lot of sushi places. I've had it as take out as part of a large group at a little get together a little while back, and it was good. We went here to have a sit down lunch a couple of months ago - since she is obsessed with sushi and I'm, well, tolerant of it at best - and there were no tables to sit at! The line was literally out the door, not just for sushi, but for the bubble tea at KFT (which Kenko shares the building with) that I wanted to get for us to share. She'd never tried KFT before.  With lines this long, the sushi must be even better than I remember. We didn't stay, and instead I took her for her first Hot Sauce Williams experience... five stars! Nevertheless, this is a very solid sushi spot, and try the Lemon Black Tea with Tapioca.  This review was not as Kenky as my reviews usually are."}
{"text":"If you've ever complained about sushi places not having the exact combination of sushi innards you want then boy is this the place for you! So many options, my head was spinning. Should I get kiwi on top? Or maybe kiwi is too much? Life choices... In general the sushi was good. Nothing amazingly mind blowing but good. I would come here again.  The problem I had was with the teas. WHY DO THEY 50,000,000 TEA OPTIONS!!!!??? I literally spent ten minutes trying to decide what I wanted to drink. You may think I'm exaggerating but seriously, my wife got her sushi and started eating before I decided...  Good tea though. I think they need to choose the most popular teas and stick with those because people's heads might be exploding trying to decide... Exploding heads are bad for business."}
{"text":"We were visiting to see the museums and saw this highly rated place on Yelp.  A lot of college kids were eating eating there when we walked in.  Ordered the chix bowl and some sushi    Food was good and the service was quick.  Would repeat"}
{"text":"OKay... So, I don't drink bubble tea. If you want to know about that, this review won't help you!  I have, however, had several sushi rolls from this place. I typically build my own (the white tuna or the salmon) because, why not? Where else am I going to find tasty sushi for $8? You can choose 2 veggies, the kind of paper you want it wrapped in, a sauce, and a topping. The yum yum sauce is (so far) my favorite. It is creamy (probably mayo-based) sauce that's rather savory.   The only \"designer\" roll that I've had is the Ohio Roll. It is deep-fried after it is assembled and the temperature threw me off. I am not saying it was bad, because it wasn't, but I couldn't get over warm sushi.   Overall - it's not the best sushi I've had in Cleveland (or anywhere), but it hits the spot."}
{"text":"Hands down to the best bubble tea place in Cleveland! I'm not much of an explorer when it comes to tea flavor, but I must say their taro with green tea and passion fruit with green tea are my two favorite! It has a nice mix of sweet and bitterness to it that makes it so irresistible and addicting. I've given up on Starbucks when I come to work because the drinks have a good amount of caffeine in it. The tapioca balls are so soft sometimes I literally swallow them. The balls do, however, get a bit tough by then end of the day. I work different shifts at UH so I do noticed the difference in softness, not a big deal though! It's better than getting frozen balls that have been microwaved and served to you like some other restaurants, which is a big turn off for me. I have also spread this Asian phenomenon with my boss and fellow co-workers, who have become regular customers here. This place also offer customize sushi, almost like a chipotle but with sushi instead. I'm not really a fan of the sushi, the seaweed wrappers are more  \"fishier\" than what I'm used to, so I'm a bit turned off by the flavor of everything else that goes into it. There is the soy wrapper option but it does cost extra. Customer service is excellent, and everyone is super friendly! Lastly, I think they can work on their pricing options for their teriyaki bowls. I spent $8.99 there for the beef teriyaki, which was not good imo (beef had no taste, vegetables were not cooked thoroughly). In comparison, the chicken teriyaki only cost about $5.99 at any mall, with bigger portion and more taste. Just a thought, but I will always go here for their amazing bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The build-your-own sushi bar is great with a wide variety of proteins, veggies, and toppings to choose from. The staff was great, my sushi maker was even bilingual! It was a nice treat to be served in my foreign native language :). I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love the sushi deal (8 piece roll for about $8) and it tastes fresh. I love making my own rolls and having the ability to mix and match and (hopefully) end up with a delish lunch or dinner. They also have standard rolls and specialty options which are a little more expensive  Tried some of the chicken rice bowl and I wasn't a fan. Chicken was tender but the sauce was very thin so the flavor wasn't impressive. Also too much veggies for my liking but I'm a carnivore so I won't hold it against them  Loved the bubble tea. So far I've only tried passion fruit and mango (I'm not very adventurous once I've found something I like) and the tapioca pearls have a perfect texture. Overall so happy this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the location. Very happy with the various teriyaki meals we had. Strong cooks. The only negative was the price was a little high for the restaurant. Again great food and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The Little Delicious Roll deserves 6 stars.  Great place and their bubble tea is awesome.   Definitely come here if you're looking for sushi or bubble tea."}
{"text":"Best boba place near campus for sure. Its chill atmosphere makes Kenkos a great spot to hang out and catch up. I recommend the hot taro bubble tea on a cold Cleveland night. Shout out to Mike for going above and beyond in customizing my order just the way I like it. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Then poke bowl is the way to go. They seem to not want people to eat to many veggies , i did not get rice and i was limited to 3 veggies and 2 toppings.  There was a decent amount of fish despite the veggie hate.  I went with the spicy tuna and fresh salmon. My veggies were lettuce, avocado, and cucumbers. Toppings were kimchi, and scallions. Got spicy mayo  siracha, and sesame seeds.  Overall it was fresh, tasty, and a nice light meal after spending the afternoon enjoying all university circle has to offer.  The sushi was a bit meh. I would rate sushi 2 stars and poke bowl 3ish. I am taking into account that this is O H I O. I would come here again if I wanted a light healthy snack ,and if Pacific East is closed."}
{"text":"I'm so excited there's good bubble tea in University Circle!  Heck, i'm glad theres any bubble tea in university circle.  It's about 4$ for tea with boba.  The staff was very informative and patient.  I'm glad they have add ons besides the traditional tapioca.  It's really refreshing to enjoy a cold, milk bubble tea in the summer!  They will serve it hot, and there plenty of options, drinks are customizable even in terms of sweetness!  You can pick 50 or 70 or 100 perc sweetness.  70 percent was perfect for my bubble tea."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC!!! Think of having the freedom to customize and create your own sushi roll..... Sort of Chipotle style ordering but with Sushi..... BRILLIANT CONCEPT!!   The quality of the sushi does not suffer also as I had initially thought it may with this style of food prep..... I personally have no complaints about this place other than I wish it were closer to where I live  FREAKIN DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the sushi, 5 for the teriyaki and bubble tea. If you do come for the teriyaki make sure to ask for the yum yum sauce."}
{"text":"Cool! Not at all what I was expecting. I was in the university circle area and saw this place had good reviews, so I decided to try it- I was realllllyyyyyy craving sushi. I walked in and was disappointed to see that I had to \"create my own roll\". Ugh. Why. But whatever. It ended up being delicious! You pick one protein, two veggies or fillers, and 2-3 sauces to put on top. I chose tofu, avocado and cucumber, sriracha and eel sauce, wrapped in brown rice and a seaweed wrap. It was SO good!! They had a few rolls that you didn't have to \"create yourself\", but they didn't sound appealing to me. They also offer teriyaki, appetizers, and bubble tea. The menu is small, but I think anyone could find something they like. I do wish the price was a bit lower. I really wanted a second roll, I usually eat more than 1, but the fact that it was 8 dollars per roll was really a deterrent. So, I left sort of hungry. But I would definitely go back since it was so tasty. Also, they have parking in the back- .50 per half hour."}
{"text":"Going in, my friend and I had no idea this was build-your-own sushi & bubble tea joint. We were intimidated by all the choices at first, but soon caught on to and appreciated its genius. The workers were kind and patient teaching us the ropes. It was a great product with a unique delivery, and the atmosphere was relaxing. I will make excuses to return to this area just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally a good boba place in Cleveland! I have been to the west coast and have been familiarized with milk tea flavors. But I haven't found a decent place for boba in Cleveland. It was kind of a far drive from the west side but it was worth it! After paying for my milk green tea boba, I decided to make my own sushi. I was hesitant at first because of all of the options, but the staff was friendly and patient. I though that eight dollars for one roll was kind of overpriced, but that sushi roll really filled me up. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Cleveland area looking for boba."}
{"text":"BUBBLE TEA RATING. I've tried the honey green tea, milk tea, peach oolong tea, grapefruit tea, and almond milk tea. Good variety in traditional milk teas, fruity non-tea drinks, and slushes. I like that they have boba, nata de coco, sweet red bean, custard, etc. available to mix into your drink. They can also customize it to different levels of sweetness (which I always half-sweet the fruit drinks) and different amounts of ice (good if you don't plan on drinking til later), which I appreciate. A little on the pricey side at $3.50-5 per drink, but I guess I could just start brewing my own coffee at home and re-purpose my daily Starbucks dollars to bubble tea...  I've also had the sushi here. Mediocre. Not bad, could be fresher. Rolls are a little small for the price. At the same price point, you mine as well go to Pacific East Coventry for better variety and value."}
{"text":"I had a teriyaki bowl and it was really good! Would definitely go back for that and you get to choose your protein, I had the chicken. Also u can create your own sushi which was really good, and I like the fact they give you yum yum sauce with the sushi! We also had a taro bubble tea which was only ok, but not bad."}
{"text":"Sushi is average.  But the bubble tea. Oh my god. I am from Taiwan, where bubble tea is originated from. I have been living off overcooked, over-sweetened bad bubble teas from Asian restaurant from around Cleveland. Not only is their bubbles cooked to the perfect chewiness, they also provide a great variety of drinks. Thank you Kenko for bringing a TRULY AUTHENTIC TAIWANESE bubble tea place to Cleveland. No more weird tasting American bubble tea for me!"}
{"text":"Went during the lunch rush, and it sure was busy. Good for them! I only had the opportunity to grab milk tea with bubbles (boba) with less ice. It was good. I'll be back to explore the food menu, and drink menu even more."}
{"text":"Kenko recently came out with a new poke bowl - this is a review specifically for their poke bowl that is different from the bubble tea. The poke bowl, presentation wise, was very good. It had all the essential elements of a poke bowl that I might expect from a poke place. The dish came with a poke sauce that I had them add, and I also asked for some spicy mayo to give it an extra kick. Like most poke bowls, the flavors blended well together, however the fish was not as good/fresh as what I could get from a poke bowl in NYC or the west coast. I'm not sure how I felt about the container they put the poke in - I'm used to the sauce and ingredients all meshing really well together, but it felt like the rice was very densely packed and separated from the rest of the ingredients. Still, it is a great place to go for someone living in the Cleveland area who wants to get an idea of what the poke craze is all about."}
{"text":"I came here the first night it opened and it was packed! Kenko has a Kung Fu Tea shop inside as well, so you can order food and get boba!!! I came here after I already had dinner, so I just got boba and unfortunately they were out of boba when I was there but the tea was great!!   I will be going back to try the food and will update my review."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my oh my.  Three for the sushi, but seven for the bubble tea, one for every year that I've waited for this day to finally come.  Bubble tea is a tea and milk-based drink originally from Taiwan, with added tapioca pearls (boba).  This place has true, authentic, legit boba, from Kung Fu Tea, a bubble tea chain that is popular all along the east coast and has finally come to town.  The boba is cooked perfectly, at the right consistency, not too soft and not too chewy or doughy, and the tea is made correctly.  The KF milk tea is what you should get - it's plain black milk tea.  Milk tea does tend to be sweet - you can ask for decreased sugar.  The sushi is fine - it's slightly better than the quality of sushi you would find in a college cafeteria.  The best deal is to make your own sushi roll (8 pieces) for $7.  You can pick one fish (they only really have salmon, tuna, tempura shrimp), two vegetables, and two sauces (the eel sauce is great).  It's fast and the fish is fresh enough, and the rice is not hard and stale.  They also have teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"WAIT. Did you just tell me I can CUSTOMIZE my own rolls?!?!?!!? AHH! personal freedom, creativity, choices, how liberating. lol alas i chose a preset roll. because why, because i need to know what makes a Kenko roll. that's right, i needed to find out how spectacular a roll is when it's named after the company. this soy-wrapped roll filled with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado topped with miso sauce and tobiko was preeeeeetty good, 5 star worthy? nah, 4 stars at most.  BUT, the novelty of this place, the delicious drink options, and the fabulous food choices makes this place 5 stars in my book.  KungFu milk tea with \"little\" sweetness (30%) - still too sweet for my tastebuds, but delicious nonetheless.  Caution: two poorly marked lines. one for making your own sushi (or ordering preset sushi rolls) and another line for teriyaki, starters, and drinks. hopefully this becomes more clear for customers.  Wait for the register is a bit long, but i'm sure this will work itself out over time. Can't wait to come back and make my own roll!!"}
{"text":"Great setup! Great slush drinks. I wish there was teriyaki sauce in the teriyaki bowls though."}
{"text":"i really dont like this place. im sorry. on one hand the drinks are watery(esp the almond milk tea) and a lot of other bad things, but on the other hand its the ONLY boba place on campus. i usually am okay with regular boba black/green milk tea but gosh its terrible here. i dont know what it is...if its because the milk powder that they use or the tea...but the first time i got the boba milk green tea was also the last time i got it. i threw it away after 5 sips bc it tasted that bad. the only thing thay i liked was the taro milk GREEN tea. it tastes good with the pudding. the grapefruit yogurt is okay as well. their food is so pricey considering what you get. for the sushi i feel like you get more rice and other stuff than you do the fish. and then a plain udon noodle soup is freaking $9. and its tiny. even plain good udon soup in other big cities is like $6. sorry but i wont be spending my money here."}
{"text":"I love the build-your-own-roll concept, and have had a good build-your own-roll experience. Unfortunately Kenko fell short from the first experience (at a place called Fusian in Columbus - which has been reviewed!).   Overwhelming flavor was rice in all rolls ordered ever (I have been twice). Mushy rice.... Which is incredibly unpleasant to me as a rice and vinegar fiend. Brown rice was ordered and it was hard, which tells me under cooked, BLECH. I have \"tasted\" all the raw options (excepted smoked salmon because I don't consider that raw) and they all have been lackluster. I have also done the cooked items minus chicken, beef, tofu (since those feels like cop-outs to me!). All are just really lacking.And yes, I've tried the many toppings and sauces and veggies. They couldn't salvage the taste.   I'm just so torn really. I want to love them so badly, but just cannot at this point. CSU, Case, and JCU student steer clear for now... I will give them this: presentation of food items is clean."}
{"text":"Finally! Good quality sushi ingredients! I moved to Ohio from Newport Beach, California, where I ate sushi and drank milk tea on a weekly basis. This place has both--and they're both delicious. Sushi is custom made or you can order from their own selection of rolls. Huge variety of teas and drinks, sweetness and ice made to order. My partner enjoyed the Teriyaki bowl a ton--I gave it a try and it was delicious. Give this place a go! Healthy and quick, just a little pricy due to the fact that it's sushi!"}
{"text":"The tea options are amazing, especially love their Almond milk tea with bobas. Mmmm! The food is also great, except the miso soup, that was the only thing we tried that I was not happy with. Otherwise sushi and the teriyaki bowls are delicious! Also they are quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Teriyaki bowls and build-your-own sushi and bubble tea - an excellent combination for the blossoming food scene of University Circle.  It's been a long time since I've eaten in University Circle.  I'll admit that if Kenko was open when I was working in the area, I'd be going quite often.  The \"build your own sushi\" aspect is pretty novel.  First you choose a protein.  Then  you get a choice of two vegetables.  Your chef will then roll your sushi for you and then allow you to choose two sauces and one topping.  The sushi doesn't have to be raw - there are cooked proteins, which include shrimp, crab, chicken, beef, and tofu.  Enough vegetable options are available for you to build most of your favorite rolls.  Toppings include tempura flakes, fried onions, sesame seed, and kimchi.  Also, you're not limited to the number of items I mentioned - add even more variety for a very marginal surcharge.  I created a salmon asparagus avocado roll with spicy mayo and masago (mini fish eggs)... just because I could.  I would rate fish quality slightly above supermarket quality - you're not going to get Jiro's here, but for around $8, the food exceeds expectations.  There's a lot of people behind the counter and I also observed some confusion between orders - so I guess efficiency in food prep could be improved.  I also sampled the chicken teriyaki.   It reminded me of the chicken teriyaki you get in the mall food court, but it was still tasty.  The bonus is that you can also buy Kung Fu bubble tea here.  I drank an oolong milk tea with my sushi and I thought it was pretty good.  Plenty of space to dine in."}
{"text":"Fast fresh and good. People are great there. David is awesome. Had the spicy tuna and Ohio rolls. Staff are very good and the line moves quick. Never had a bad roll here."}
{"text":"The idea of making your own sushi by picking the wrap, type of rice, protein, veggies, sauce(s), and toppings is cute, and I really like the option of using brown rice in the sushi! The service here is usually very quick with its assembly line-like set up. Also, the storefront of Kenko is shared with Kung Fu Tea so you can order some boba along with your meal! While as it's fun to build your own sushi, the tray of 8 sushi pieces honestly does not really fill me up. I can eat the entire tray in like 2 minutes and feel like I could eat another order, so I find the teriyaki bowls to be much more satisfying, especially for the price you pay. I typically like the getting the teriyaki bowl with chicken and udon noodles (which is an additional $1.50). This ends up costing a bit over $10, which is kind of pricey, but it is tasty and quite flavorful! The employees here are all really friendly, and I've always been satisfied with the service :)  Overall, Kenko is a fun place to try out if you want to make your own sushi, but it is definitely on the pricier side for how filling of a meal that you get. The store itself is quite spacious and clean, which could be a good for studying with some boba ;)"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I wanted to try something new for lunch today and stumbled upon Kenko. We loved the fast service and the rice pooping machine. However, the food did not wow us. Things we liked: location, fast service, make your own sushi, the sauces & the grilled beef. Things that need improvement: Rice was bland & the shrimp had not been deveined (feces). Also it was overpriced for the quality of food. After, the food did not sit well in our stomachs."}
{"text":"I've never been to a fast food type of sushi place, so I was interested to check this place out. It's like Chipotle but for sushi - you pick your wrap, rice, fillings, toppings, and sauces. There are lots of choices, and as a first timer, I was pretty overwhelmed. I would recommend looking at their online menu and getting an idea of what you'd like before going in.  The sushi was okay. Very american-ized. The sauces were overpowering, and the rice was overcooked. I think it's a cool concept and a fun way for people to try sushi and customize their own rolls, but being the sushi snob that I am, I'm going to stick to the traditional Japanese restaurants. The one thing I really liked though was that they offer gluten free soy sauce! I've never seen that. I snagged some extra packets for future use :P   The boba tea here is awesome though. Loved the Honey Black Tea. I also tried the Jasmine Green Tea (unsweetened) which was okay. The boba were nice and chewy.  Interior was nice and open, lots of natural lighting. Provided communal seating. Free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I come here quite often. It was a great place at first, I guess I just got a little used to it. Gets a little slow during rush hours, but otherwise, pretty good. The sushi rolls are rather simple and good. I never tried any of the bowls.   The milk tea though!!! I love the coconut milk tea, hot and cold. The fruity ones are amazing, too. Best milk tea I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great teriyaki. Much more flavor than Sakkio. Priced well and is located at University Circle which is always fun to explore. Highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"In addition to their fantastic bubble tea options, Kenko sports an array of great food options. They have make your own sushi, as well as teriyaki bowls. Highly recommend trying everything until you find your groove."}
{"text":"The Bubble Tea here is delicious and probably the main reason people go so frequently. Love the variety of flavors you can choose AND you get to personalize it with how sweet you want, how much ice, and what kind of topping you want (bubbles, jellys, etc).   The sushi is pretty good, not the super fresh kind but you definitely get what you pay for. I personally enjoy their poke bowls and you can make your own and personalize it too with what sauces (eel and yum yum sauce are my go tos), meats (love the raw fish), and vegetables you want. They give you a pretty good portion too regardless if you choose salmon or chicken, same price so get the really good stuff if you enjoy raw fish! My guy friends always get the teriyaki and it seems to keep them full, would say the portions are pretty big despite how small the containers look.  Space is clean and lots of room for big groups or independent studying. They have a lot of outlets for your laptop but a little loud for my studying vibes. Employees are nice and they're super quick!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have really good bubble tea, and a lot of different varieties. I got the wow red bean milk with bubbles, which was pretty good They also have sushi and I think teriyaki. There are the typical sushi rolls, but also make your own, and you choose the type of meat/fish, vegetables, topping, sauces, which is really cool. I got a spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber roll with fried onions and yum yum sauce and I really enjoyed that"}
{"text":"Kung Fu Tea, welcome to Cleveland.  Cleveland, welcome to legit boba.   I'll be back..."}
{"text":"best And only decent bubble tea place in cleveland area. only place i choose. I come here fairly often.  I only here for bubble tea. Never tried anything else. The bubble tea is a little expensive. And there is no milk cap. Sad.  The bathroom is incredibly nice And clean. I like it. The bathroom really can tell you something about this place."}
{"text":"This is a chipotle type version for sushi. They have rolls made , rolls you can make also sushi burritos you can make. Also a hibachi bowl option. I opted for the create your own sushi-ritto. I enjoyed it and would come back. This is more of a place for a quick bite to eat for lunch not for fancy dinners or a date."}
{"text":"Um yum. This was a fun find! Milk tea was delish, staff were super nice, and an interesting build your own sushi concept! I had spicy tuna with avocado and scallions and it tasted very fresh. Will go back when I need a quick sushi fix!"}
{"text":"The boba is really good. Go try it. Welcome to legit Asian boba guys. Get the green milk tea flavor. You won't be disappointed I promise. I haven't true the sushi so I can't say much about it."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place a lot and frankly is also one of my favorite sushi places. However, I went in today to get my usual order of shrimp tempura sushi with cucumbers and carrots. The worker picks up 3 pieces of each (cucumber and carrots) very hesitantly and puts it on my roll. I asked him for more since he was clearly being stingy and he said it would be an extra $1. I refused to pay the extra dollar but informed him I would be posting a negative review on yelp based on my experience and he didn't even seem to mind."}
{"text":"Like others said, Kenko is like a Chipotle for sushi (aka build your own sushi!). Flow is simple and written on the menu: 1) pick your wrap (seaweed, or soy for an extra charge), 2) pick white or brown rice, 3) pick your protein (there are both cooked and raw options), 4) pick your veggies (up to 2 without extra charge), 5) pick your sauces (up to 2 without extra charge), and 6) pick a topping. This make-your-own-sushi (8 pieces) order totals to $7.95, so about $1 per piece. They also have teriyaki bowls as a non-sushi option, or other preset rolls if you don't want to make your own. The menu is kind of overwhelming at first, so take a moment to read it before getting in line (or do your prep work online :D).  Overall, the sushi tasted pretty good and was pretty filling, especially if you get a tea drink from Kung Fu Tea to go with. It definitely wasn't top of the line sushi, but it's good for the price and a fun concept. Kenko shares a common dining area with Kung Fu Tea, where there is lots of clean and modern tables, with many outlets. They also have free wifi."}
{"text":"I've been coming here and getting sushi ever since they opened. Their customer service is the best. They have great employees. They are so nice! I love Kenko!"}
{"text":"As a college student at Case Western, Kenko is probably the best sushi place-walking distance. However, I don't really consider it real sushi, because it reminds me more of the korean rice roll \"Kimbab.\" When you first walk in, there's a line and you pick the ingredients that you want in your roll. So for example, you pick your wrap (seaweed or soy), rice (brown or white), protein, vegetables, and toppings/sauces.  The sushi rolls are  around $8 each, you get 6 pieces.   If you aren't really feeling sushi. don't worry because there are a lot of other options too! They have udon noodle bowls that are really filling for just $7-8, and teriyaki bowls where you can pick a choice of protein (chicken, beef, and for vegetarians- tofu and vegetables) that can have a rice or noodle base.  Kenko also offers boba tea from Kung Fu Tea, which is probably one of my favorite boba chains. They offer so many tea flavors, I think I've pretty much tried most flavors. My favorite are the Red Date punch tea, and taro milk green tea. The pricing for boba teas range from $3.50-$4.50 depending on size and toppings you add in.   The sushi isn't bad at all for a quick fix, even though it may be pricey for the quality of the sushi. The boba tea is a must though if you're close by! There's a lot of room in the restaurant to eat with friend or two, or a big group. Great music is played in the background, and overall the ambience of the place is awesome. Would recommend definitely for dates, lunch with a group, or even to study."}
{"text":"This is not a purists' sushi spot. It's the polar opposite. You get efficiently assembled sushi without the special touch only a true chef can give. However, aside as being only on par with prepacked sushi from an up scale supermarket, this place is fresh, and though a couple of dollars over-priced, passes for eh, good. My only gripe is that they have yet to master the art of preserving the beautiful color of pre-cut avocado. A light spritz of lime, boys. Yep, anytime. That's what I'm here for.."}
{"text":"I am getting old. The Jesus Year of age 33 has been transformative and life changing as was expected. The creeping shadow of death follows each step and haunts thoughts. This path has been the only way. The Wu Wei. As was said in Shogun Assassin \"Oh Mad One. We see your trap. You can never escape your fate.\" The Mad One is the Demiurge of Gnosticism. I see the traps now and am aware. One trap I fall into is alcohol. Alcohol provides an altered state. Boba Tea carries roughly the same caloric load without the feeling of floating in space and transcendence. I enjoyed the white gourd bubble tea the most. The standard tea and milk flavor is satisfying. I believe the hype surrounding this bizarre drink of balls. I will limit my intake because of caloric count and the warning from Germany stating the tapioca balls may contain cancer causing agents. The sushi is decent for fast food style rolls. They are heavy. Kenko is a great addition to Uptown development in University Circle."}
{"text":"Really cool build your own sushi! Lots of options and very fresh! I loaded up my custom sushi roll with salmon, avocado, Japanese pickle, and topped with eel sauce. Delicious and the perfect portion size and price. Miso soup was fantastic as well. Can't wait to go back to try the Udon and the literally dozens of tea options."}
{"text":"On a hot Saturday afternoon, I was craving to get my Asian food fix, and I really like nothing better than a hodge podge of customizable Asian creations. I was really excited to try Kenko because it has two things I value highly in a dining establishment: options and bubble tea.   We drove out to Cleveland Heights for food and boba, and when we entered Kenko, it had a steady flow of business, but was still spacious and quiet. The menu has a lot of choices, and it honestly took me longer than I expected to choose. I decided to get a beef teriyaki bowl, and my SO ordered an beef sushi roll (weird, but we rolled with it.) It took awhile to customize his sushi, and then we were off to the counter to finish up and order the boba I was anxiously awaiting.  I'm a bubble tea connoisseur; I've had it in nearly every state and major city on the east coast of the U.S. and Canada. My eyes popped wide open when I heard Kenko had Kung Fu Tea, my Chicago Chinatown favorite. When we had already finished ordering his sushi and I stepped up to the register about to burst with happiness, the staff informed us they were out of bubble tea. I was devastated. If we hadn't already ordered, I would have shot across the street to Ninja City. I was hoping the food would make up for my sudden state of depression, but it really didn't. I'd say the teriyaki bowl was a step above Sakkio Japan. The udon noodles were a nice touch, but if you blindfolded me, I would have thought I was eating at the mall. The sushi was actually quite good, but we didn't feel it was worth a 35 minute drive for with so many sushi options near us."}
{"text":"I walked in here the other night and walked out after a minute . sorry but my pet peeve is restaurants with bad ventilation . I just knew that if I stayed any longer I would smell like fried food sticking to my clothes. they need to turn up their exhaust as required by the health department."}
{"text":"In town for a meeting, a couple of us wandered around looking for dinner.  I had read the reviews for the Bubble tea so I recognized the name when I saw it.  We were vacillating between this place and the one across the street and Kenko just looked more inviting.  We went in, placed our order on the iPads and took a seat   Our dinners were similar- I opted not to get sushi because I am a huge fan of eel and didn't see it on the options.  Instead I ordered beef teryaki, double veggies, mushrooms and rice.  I also ordered the jasmine green tea with double bubbles.  When your order is ready, they call your name and you return to the counter to pick it up.  Both items came very quickly- much to our surprise because they were getting busy.  The beef was sliced paper thin, the veggies slightly al dente and the rice was fresh.  The sauce to food ratio was light- just the way I like it.  Both my companion and I were truly delighted with our meals.  The bubble tea- excellent.  I love that you can customize everything from the sweetener to the ice level to the amount of bubbles.    Overall- we couldn't have asked for better.  I have every intention of running over for more bubble tea during our breaks!"}
{"text":"Picked up dinner for the family here tonight. Got chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki and a custom sushi roll (tuna, avacado, cucumber, panko, fish eggs and spicy mayo).   Food tastes fresh which for fast casual sushi was my biggest concern. Veggies were steamed perfectly and tell sushi was good although rolled a little loose. They have plenty of cool sauces you can get,  yum yum, spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, etc. I live down the street so I will definitely be back. Good, but for $7 a roll clearly not the best sushi I have ever had. Main reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the lack of meat in my bowls.  Seems like there are better deals out there in terms of Chinese food."}
{"text":"The Verdict: Go if you want to grab a casual meal with bubble tea! (or if you want to get just get your bubble tea fix in University Circle).  The Food: YESSSSS I'm so happy there's at least one bubble tea place and that it's LEGITIMATE is even better! I love getting the honey lemonade tea. I don't like the drinks with milk in it cause they got that powdery look and fake taste. When I want straight up tea, I usually ask for 70% sugar. Their fried rice bowl is actually surprisingly yummy and lots of toppings (tip: add some sriracha to up your spice game!) As for the sushi, I always go for the Little Delicious Roll.  The Extra: There's two entrances - front is accessible on Euclid Ave, back is accessible in the driveway/walkway next to the hotel. There's a parking lot (metered) right next to the building! When you go in, there's a unique ways of ordering, don't worry, there are directions! If you're ordering sushi, go to the left of the divider. If you're ordering rice/noodle bowls, go to the right of the divider. For sushi, it's basically like Chipotle where you can build your own sushi or they have pre-named ones. As for ordering bubble tea, you can go straight to the cashier or they have 2 iPads for ordering by card. After that, they'll call your order by name.  For bubble tea, you can choose ur tea/drink type, boba/toppings, amount of sugar, amount of ice. If you don't know what they are, the workers are SUPER nice, so ask! They can even offer a sample of toppings or drink.  The inside has a LOT of seating! Kenko also has wifi (although I constantly have trouble with it). What's great is that they have LOTS of outlets W/ USB OUTLETS TOO! People are there to hang out, study for hours or some student clubs even go there. There are also 2 large TVs usually on sports."}
{"text":"3 stars for the sushi - it is overpriced ($7 per roll?!) and not very good. The rice descends from a new age rice pooping machine that lowers perfect squares of sushi rice onto a sheet of nori. It feels wrong and like a slap in the face to sushi chefs everywhere. The quality of seafood is clearly not fresh, and their options are limited. If you really crave sushi, it's an OK fix, but that's why it's 3 stars. It's just OK.  5 stars for bubble tea - I've been at CWRU for 4 years now and I am blessed that a King Fu Tea opened on campus in my 3rd year. I actually probably shouted profanities to the sky, thanking god for answering my prayers. It's good... like really good... so good that it's worth spending $4 on a fruity drink that you eventually have to chew.   4 stars for teriyaki bowl - portions are big and competitive as a \"lunch and dinner\" type of meal. It's definitely very rice heavy, hence the 4 stars, and there are no dietary considerations so my gluten free friends can't have a teriyaki bowl. To be honest, the food is far from authentic. What Tex Mex is to mexican food, the teriyaki bowl is to Japanese food. However, it's such good value for the money that you can't help but go back.  Go for the bubble tea, return for the bubble tea, and if you're hungry, get the rice bowl and not the sushi."}
{"text":"It's okay if I want to have sushi but don't want to go too far from the school. The food is okay. I wouldn't recommend Teriyaki, though."}
{"text":"So good! The sushi is good quality and the prices aren't bad. Very cool concept- Kind of like ordering at chipotle! Hip and cool environment as well. Would come here again."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. As soon as you walk through the doors, I can just feel the happy, positive vibes lol (I know, sounds silly). With this place you can make your own sushi...just look on the menu board and you can go to town and be super creative. I wasn't that bold yet so I opted to get the Ohio Roll. Everyone there was so helpful and friendly. They were giving me suggestions about different menu items which led me to try the Taro Milk Tea. I never had bubble tea so one of the staff members let me sample it...it has a very acquired taste...meh. So they suggested to get the Taro Milk Tea without bubbles.  The drink itself was very good and glad it was recommended to me. The Ohio Roll was really good, I love wasabi and kind of wished I had a little more of it lol.  I want to go back and build my own sushi and try the other milk tea flavors (the Oreo one...mmmmmm have to get that one).   This place is ah-may-zing!"}
{"text":"What a cool joint! Would have never stopped in here except I happened to be on this side of town for a work event and needed to grab a quick dinner. I stopped in around 6:30pm on a Monday night and was shocked to find a crazy long line for bubble tea.  Their \"build your own sushi\" line wasn't as popular, but I decided to go for it since I was in a hurry. Basically you can pick what kind of fish, veggies and sauce you want and you get 8 normal sized pieces for about $8. It's pretty much grocery store sushi, which is to say, it's not the freshest, it's not the best, but it's cheap and fast. I guess if you're in a hurry and craving sushi this would be a good option?  The star of the show was really the bubble tea though, or I should say, their tea options in general, because they have a TON to choose from, even more than the average bubble tea shop. I ended up choosing the coconut milk tea, and boy was it delicious! It didn't have a saccharine sweet or artificial coconut taste, but rather something more akin to pure coconut milk. Their drinks aren't the cheapest, but for the quality I think it's a fair price.  The food is quick, but you might end up having to wait a while for bubble tea if they are busy, the preparation is almost like a barista line at Starbucks. Fortunately there is plenty of seating inside, including window seats and booths.  Overall, I don't think I would go out of my way to come here again, but I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back for tea again if I was in the area."}
