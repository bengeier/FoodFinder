{"text":"Did not find the dishes as authentic as the Salad Thai in downtown Oakville. It was busy and the service was slow."}
{"text":"Below Average food. We went to the restaurant after reading the previous reviews. But were disappointed. Atleast the vegetarian options were not good. I don't think we will return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Their dishes are yummy. 

Place is on Dundas St by Bronte Road next to gas station. Inside it's very nice and tasteful and clean inside.
 If you like Thai then you will love this place. Nice people too. 

Yellow curry chicken is our favorite. 
Lunch specials are great deal for $8 including weekends which is nice. 

Try this place!!!!!  Top pick overall for our family."}
{"text":"Overrated. With other Thai restaurants close by I'm not sure why this place has such a high rating. 

The green curry I ordered was bland, and had very questionable, slimy chicken pieces in it. Vegetables were absent with just two slivers of carrot and too many large inedible chunks of onion. 

Spicy Thai salad was a mess of cabbage chunks glazed with a type of sweet and sour sauce. Wasn't spicy, and not sure if it counts as Thai either. 

Dining companion had drunken noodles with beef. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either. There were puddles of oil on the bottom of his plate.

Service: Cutlery provided for the table had noticeable food residue on it. We ate with the disposable chopsticks. Server reaked of cigarette smoke. 

Verdict: Worst dining experience of 2016. Worst Thai meal of all time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch, dinner or takeout.

At $7.99 lunch is an excellent value and will give you your choice of a Soup or Spring Rolls plus an entree.

Beyond the reasonable pricing the quality of the food makes this place stand out. Spring Rolls are light and crispy, the curry's are flavorful and the presentation of everything is pretty nice as well.

Tip: Got a cold or just like a nice chicken soup?  Try the Chicken Pho soup and you'll receive an enormous bowl of chicken soup w/noodles and large pieces of chicken, on the side will be sauces,  a fresh chilli and bean sprouts.

I've eaten here more times than I can count and the quality is always consistent."}
{"text":"This is our go to for Thai take out in the area. Good red curry chicken, also eggplant beef dish. I like the deep fried whole snapper - tasty! I would stay away from their Bun (Vietnamese vermicelli) dishes- really don't use the right noodles in my opinion. They also provide a 10% cash discount for takeout, and they keep track of any allergies you have. Pad Thai is reasonably priced though not great."}
{"text":"Great restaurant - don't let the physical location sway you.  I have been there for eat in and have also ordered take-out.  The portions are generous and the food is very good.  They run a mean take-out business.  When we were there, the phone was constantly ringing for take-out orders.  When I called for take-out, my order was ready in 10 minutes.  Pretty quick!!

Excellent green curry chicken and singapore curry noodles.  The vietnamese spring rolls were unusual, but tasty.  Also recommend the curry chicken fried rice.  We will be back to try more of the vietnamese items on the menu.  This place will likely turn into our go-to takeout place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Do not the outside of the restaurant fools you, it may be next to a gas station but this place is packed with good asian flavor and good value as well. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have lived 5 minutes from this place but never gone in.  Now that I'm moving away, I'm wishing I would have gone in!

My finance and I got: Thai spring roll, cold shrimp roll, chicken singapore noodles and funky deluxe fried rice.  All were delicious and good price point.  $40 for all.  They adjusted the spiciness of the singapore noodles for me.  

Very nice people who work there.  It is NOT fine dining, but a great place for a casual meal or takeout.  Portion sizes of noodles and rice dishes were huge."}
{"text":"This is the only Thai place worth going to in Northwest Oakville. Food is delicious and reasonably priced but sometimes inconsistent. Their curries and other standards such as pad Thai are decent. We prefer delivery because the parking lot shared with a gas station can quite literally damage your car. Delivery guy always says 1 hour but shows up in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Was looking for some moderately priced noodles close by and arrived here. Location was a bit bizarrely placed, being next to a gas station and all. Ordered the satay pad Thai, and date ordered the standard pad Thai. Maybe I've been spoiled living in Vancouver the past couple years, but I wasn't too impressed. Very sticky, with little meat and reminded me of food court mall noodles. 

The meal was definitely fine by all means, but I doubt I'd go back or recommend the place"}
{"text":"We go there at least once a month and have done so for years.  The portions are very generous and priced accordingly (great value) and to top it off, all of the dishes we've tried over the years continue to exceed expectations.  

It is located in the middle of nowhere on Dundas so we consider it to be a hidden jewel well worth the visit.  The restaurant is spotless and the staff are truly 5 star with their goal being to deliver 1st class service that goes along with the 5 star menu.  

We just can't say enough and all of our friends that we've taken feel the same way and keep on referring their friends."}
{"text":"Do not let the location of this place deter you to try out their food!  They have awesome thai/ asian fusion dishes for the location.  We ordered take out and were surprised with huge portions!

They make a descent pad thai and some killer coconut rice!  Their prices are on par with the other thai places in the area.  

I will definitely be back if I am in area."}
{"text":"I'm in Oakville for 2 weeks for business.  So far everyplace I've eaten at has been at least serviceable, it may not be the tastiest thing ever but it was clean and friendly.  Also Canadians can cook a damn good piece of fish :)

Funky Thai is the first place I've eaten where I'm afraid I'm going to get sick.  I got regular Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp and the soft rolls with mango.  The rolls were fine, exactly what I expect.  The pad thai was the worst version I've ever had.  Ever.  I've eaten at dozens of Thai places and am spoiled as I worked in a Thai restaurant in college and had family meal prepared by the Thai mama every night.  I know what it is supposed to taste like and KETCHUP IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE TAMARIND SUBSTITUTE.  The shrimp tasted off and to be perfectly honest it's been about half hour since I ate and I do not feel well.

Avoid this place.  Thai Senses isn't special in the taste department, but I didn't feel sick afterward!"}
{"text":"The Tom yum soup is back to being as good as it used to be. Pity they have decided to stop using bamboo shoots in their veggie dishes as well as in their curries.
Our waiter was consistently talking on her cell phone while we were there and doing her job at the same time. Even though she had headphones it was Unprofessional and Ruse imo"}
{"text":"When you're a foodie, you know that the best places to eat are those mom and pop, hole in the wall places. This my friends, is a hole in the wall place and definitely worth venturing out for. I almost didn't want to post this out of fear it would get too popular and too busy. I'll take my chances, like good art - good food should not be hidden. 

It's a small restaurant by a truck gas stop, but man the food is good. My husband and I get the pad Thai every time and we trade off on the mango chicken stir fry and peanut beef stir fry. The meat is so tender and the food is so flavourful. The dishes come out hot and plentiful. 

If you're in Oakville and looking for amazing thai, this place is fantastic. Stop by, it is amazing. If you prefer better ambiance, get it to go. Hope you give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a handful of times but the chicken and beef Shanghai Noodle Stir fry was Absolutely delicious! From the moment I opened the lid my mouth was salivating. Went to pickup my order it was ready for me and the hostess was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the gas station it's next to! This place has one of the best coconut curries I've had!! Soups are a must have :) Great food and quick service!! However wish they did a little more with the ambiance."}
{"text":"Tried the Singapore noodles and spring rolls.  Noodles were nice and spicy, curry seasoning was prominent but not overpowering.  Vermicelli was perfectly cooked and had bite.  Portion of chicken provided was ok albeit a bit skimpy--tofu was noticeably absent as well.  Spring rolls were just ok.  Filling was a bit mushy for my taste.  Service was adequate.  Serving size was generous for the price.  I did take out but the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"fantastic food, good service and prices. best thai food in town."}
{"text":"Been to this place several times, usually stick to the Pad Thai, but have also tried the curries. Love them all. Huge portions, usually share the Pad Thai take out with my GF, and we are both full.

Only negative thing I can think of is that I'm not a fan of their spring rolls at all, which is unusual because their are usually a very simple item. 

Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Note: Been here a few times, but that was 1-2 years ago. 

Atmosphere:  3/5 - It's clean, but I don't think the decor is anything special.  It's kind of bare bones, IMHO.

Food: I've had the sweet and sour fish and I remember it being very crispy and flavourful.  

Verdict: it's decent for Oakville, but it doesn't compare to Thai places downtown."}
{"text":"Yes! Singapore noodles with chix really hit the spot. This place is a rare find - delicious, non-greasy, and there's so much in the bowl you kan just dig in like a heathen, knowing there'll be more for later. Something good to eat for work lunch. 

Friends also liked the satay pad thai, and general tsao's chicken."}
{"text":"I am reluctant to give bad reviews to places that are just mediocre, but I feel compelled to balance out the good ones that led me to make the mistake of coming here while traveling.  Contrary to some of those reviews, you should actually pay attention to the location, because it is in fact indicative of what you'll get, which is basically the equivalent of the kind of chain \"asian\" restaurant you would find in a mall or airport.  I had a bit of an additional premonition when I saw that the lunch specials menu contained more non-Thai than Thai dishes.  I got final confirmation that my mediocre meal was not an anomaly when I asked for a Thai iced coffee and was met with an incredulous look and a reply of \"we don't have that here.\" There is really no reason to go here unless you work in one of the buildings across the street."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!And don't be fooled by the outside.So this Thai restaurant is located behind a gas station with no fancy welcoming look, the parking area too is not finished well with stones and gravel.

So a neighbor of ours highly recommend us to try this Thai restaurant, I was very skeptical since the reviews were pretty low.None the less I did give it a shot today and was pleasantly surprised and happy with the interior, service and food.

So I came here right after my doctors appointment and decided to get a couple of entrees to try out.I opted to stick with the lunch menu.My order was a spicy Thai basil chicken and glass noodles with vegetables and chicken.Every lunch special comes with a soup or spring roll, I got one of each.

The spring roll were absolutely divine much bigger and stuffed well compared to many other Thai restaurant.The hot and sour soup was pretty standard.

The main entrees came out within 10-12 minutes after ordering.Both the dishes were so so flavorful and the portions were generous.I also felt that they don't skimp on their meat.Both my entrees were loaded with meat.

I ate as much as I could and took the remaining home for dinner.My server was this middle aged gentleman, he was fast and kept checking on me.He also packed my leftovers which I thought was super nice.

The place itself is very clean and definitely not that bad as it may look from outside.I highly recommend going here for lunch special and more.

I do look forward to coming here again to try out some more dishes with my family."}
{"text":"My Go To place for lunch. Their lunch specials run daily until 3 pm and for $10+tax you get an appetizer and a main entree.
I like the spring rolls and I always get the Vegetarian Red Curry. Its so delicious and spicy. Great service and definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Does not look like much from the outside but go in. Great food and great staff. Service is amazing and a must is the red curry.   A MUST!! B"}
{"text":"Been here several times, it's great!, The lunch specials are affordable and well done! The owners are friendly as is the staff, the service has it's up's adown's, but overall just about anything you order is pretty darn close to just right."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, $9.99 lunch menu with appetizer of your choice.  Good is tasty.  Pretty sure they don't use MSG because I was not thirsty after eating it!"}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with anything. The pad Thai had a weird taste to it. The hot and sour soup wasn't great and the green curry chicken tasted like rubber. I was really looking forward to this place because of the reviews... disappointed"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Had the golden curry with tofu. It was amazing to say the least. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, fair price.  The smells ruined this place for me though.  Burning cookware smell from kitchen was bad enough (accidents happen)...but this place is located about 50 feet from a gas station.  The whole hour we were in there all you could smell was overwhelming gas smell.  Don't know if it's all the time or occasional but because of it I won't go back."}
{"text":"Hige fan of funky thai! It really does look like a sub standard place beside a gas station. But dont let the extierior fool you. Funky thai has a nice dining area that i really enjoy having dinner dates at. It really feels like a hidden gem, with fresh thai curries made to order on a spice level of one to 5 stars. Depending on the cheif in that day it can be very spicy when you ask for 5 stars. Very good ginger beef and there \"curry pad thai\" is fantastic. The only down side to funky thai is that it is not going to be a healthy meal. Even a simple order of vegatvles are soaked in delecious oils. Funku thai is a place i frequent and wojld highly reccomend, hell go get a seat and dine in! You wont regret how mucj more frrsh the food tastes straight from the wok to your plate!"}
{"text":"Don't go by the looks (inside or outside)...go by the (bad) taste

Ordered a takeout satay pad thai a few days ago. The portion size was modest which is fine if the taste is great. No sir (or madam.) The dish had a burnt smell and flavour. What's more, I was expecting a cashew or peanut paste but could taste none.  

I, me and myself -- all three of us are not going there again."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is located in an odd spot right beside a gas station but ignore the outward appearance of this place since the food here is really good! 

I first came here years ago and recently have been here twice in the past 3 months. Their pad thai is really tasty. It's full of that savoury tamarind flavour that pad thai should have and like any other Thai place, you can choose to have it with veggies, chicken or beef. If you get chicken or beef, it's about $3 extra if I remember right. I would also recommend their green curry with veggies here since it has a slight kick to it, it has a good portion of veggies and it comes with rice. Again, you can choose to have chicken or beef instead of just veggies for a few extra dollars. The masaman or golden curry is also good here but milder spice than the green curry. 

No complaints about the service here as staff are polite and efficient with filling orders and payments at the register.

Getting take out from here is also quick - about 20 minutes wait when you call ahead. Tip: Spend $25 or more before taxes and you can get 10% off your order if you pay in cash! There's also a sign at the cash register with this reminder. 

In terms of parking, there are about 20 parking spots and even though it can get busy here since it seems to be an Oakville fave, I've never had an issue with finding a spot.

Enjoy this gem of a restaurant if you ever happen to be in Oakville!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend and was disappointed with the quality of the food. I ordered a chicken glass noodle style soup even though I wanted a normal bowl of pho which wasn't an option. (It was a cold night and after a workout; I was craving a hardy bowl of pho to satisfy my craving). My boyfriend was coaxed into ordering a soup dish that was super spicy which was out of his level of heat meter. I find there menu selection is more toward the Thai side. The place is clean and friendly so for this reason I would be willing to give this place another try but next time I will order a Thai or Chinese dish instead. Stay tune to read my second review on my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Looks dumpy next to the run down gas station and I used to clown on this place as it looked gross from driving by. However a friend told me about it and once I actually went inside - it looks beautiful and it's very clean. Crispy beef is my favourite. The spring rolls are loaded and wonderful. Friendly staff and good prices / portions. Guess I answered my own question about how this place has stayed in business for so many years. Been going here for a few years now. Still good."}
{"text":"Very flavorful green eggplant curry. For the money very very well prepared.  The menu has a good range of options with both Thai and Vietnamese. My favorite Thai in the area."}
{"text":"Went for supper - off the charts. Fav's are Crispy Beef and Salt and Pepper Shrimp. Pad Thai rocks as well. 

Good Pan-asian food - they listen to their customers."}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout experience only. Easy to order, no miscommunication on our order, food was ready fast, spicy means Thai spicy-- level 5 truly is hot! The satay pad Thai is great, wish they had drunken noodles too!
Location is strange- next to a gas station, but worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Their Pad Thai is great. Service is very fast, efficient and worthy of 5 stars. Overall, a great place for Thai and Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I was so excited to find a Thai resto I could pop in for lunch. 

All the other reviews mention this but there is a gas station attached to the restaurant. 
There's plenty of parking spots on the other side of the restaurant. 

Walking in the restaurant seemed clean and authentic. There were only several tables that were full for lunch so I was quickly seated. 

There is a lunch special menu ($10) and I ordered the chicken pad thai with level 3 heat and the soup. I took off 1 star because the waitress brought me out a spring roll :( I was a little upset because the spring roll was obviously heated and would be thrown out or served to the next customer so I didn't complain. But the store wasn't busy and there were 3 waitresses so I couldn't blame it on lunch rush error. 

The pad Thai was generous and I loved how they left their tofu in big chunks. The chicken was overall decent too. However, overall as a dish the plate was only average as it was a little over saucy.  

I will be back to try their curry!"}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch special, wasn't disappointed. 

Outside appearance is deceiving, the inside decor is nice. The service was very timely, and the food was great, especially for the price. I ordered the spring roll and the Spicy Red Curry, which was amazing.

I would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for my gfs birthday lunch and I've been here on another occasion. It definitely looks like it should be a diner or dive bar based on its location, but once you step inside it's quite nice.

We were greeted instantly at the door and were at our seats with water pretty quickly. The severs were very friendly. My gf got the chicken fried rice and I got the lunch special: spring roll and chicken pad thai. It all came pretty quickly.

The Pad Thai was pretty great to be honest, I had it about 5-6 months ago and couldn't remember if I liked it, but it was great. The flavour was great, chicken cooked perfectly, all great. Usually I have a complaint, but none this time. The spring rolls were ok, (wheat wrappers also) nothing special. My gf said the rice was great as well."}
