{"text":"Wow.. 

I came here in Oct.   Food..  Terrible.   Friend ordered a T-bone,  medium rare.   Got some hunk of undercooked beef leftover instead.    Here again tonight to see a live band (now THEY are good) .   Been here 2 hours,  waitress came to us ONCE.   Onky one girl working on a Friday with a live band.   Owner of the joint stands around with his hands in his pockets all night.    If it wasn't for the entertainment,  I'd never come here...  Ever... Again..."}
{"text":"Typical dive bar.  Lukewarm beer, lukewarm food.  Not a good place for families with children, as during the early hours of Sunday, July 23rd 2017, 5 people were shot in this bar, with several in critical condition.  Not sure whether it was angry customers shooting the staff, or angry staff shooting the customers.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting.  From the stained carpet to the food that was all previously frozen to the terrible service experienced when going to this place.  Their hamburgers have the consistency of a leather shoe.  I will never be dining here ever again and would suggest that if you actually care what you out into your body that you stay far way from the food at this place."}
