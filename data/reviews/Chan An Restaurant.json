{"text":"My favorite local Chinese take out. I have been visiting for years and have been pleased with the service and the food is good.  I just wish they delivered and the place didn't look like such a dump."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the middle of the shopping center with the Giant Eagle in the South Side.  Let me tell you, the enviroment is not a plus.  It's kind of like a fast food restaraunt atmosphere and it's not in the best area of town.   I have eaten General Tso's chicken all over this country and it is the very best General Tso's EVER!  I order it extra spicy and it's amazing. I can't speak for the other food there, other than the egg rolls, rice and hot and sour soup are good too.  The General Tso's is so good though, I've never ordered anything else."}
{"text":"I give Chan An 5 stars because of its homeliness, convenience and good tasting food. Their food really hit the spot after a hard work out. We have tried a few things on their menu, some are not as good as others. I highly recommend any of the chow mei fun items. Beef with broccoli is great. Food is very affordable. It's a great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been getting chinese food here since I moved up iin June. It's our favorite chinese food place. We love the seafood options and the added bean sprouts in the fried rice and other dishes is a great texture change from the places where I used to live. (Eastern Panhandle, WV). We try to go once a week, and to order over 10.00 for the free egg rolls! The staff is nice and I would recommend giving them a try if you've been wary of it until now."}
{"text":"Chan An. It looks like a dive from the outside but don't let that put you off. It's busy. It's cheap. It's fast. It's good. You get two free egg rolls with orders over $15 or a free pint of fried rice for orders over $25. I visit Chan An twice a month sometimes more. I love the lady that normally takes your order at the counter. I call her Mrs. Chan An. Very nice"}
{"text":"Always been my go to for Chinese...best gen. tso I've had other than New Dragon. The hidden gem is the sweet n sour chicken but you have to order the sauce on the side n dip em!!! The lo mein is one of the best! Awesome place for the price!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and it is still the best in the west. I usually get the general Tso but last night I tried the beef lo mein it was, as expected, awesome. The Chan an also has the BEST egg rolls. This place has been at that location since I can remember and is because it is delicious and the staff is efficient and friendly.  Hope it is always there."}
{"text":"I ordered the Garlic Chicken and it was delicious, hot, fresh, flavorful and the chicken was tender. Large portions and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Spicy curry rice noodle are the best !getting them all the time . Also I like it rolls with soy sauce . And chicken broccoli is also pretty good . Recommend this place ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Place to eat in the area. It is a little out of the way for us but it is so good.   We ordered the chicken and broccoli for 2. My boyfriend love it . Lots of meat, veggies, and rice to feed 3 actual people. He can eat it all in one sitting but he feels miserable after. He gets egg rolls for free since we spend 25 dollars I believe   I always get the cheese wontons because they are super filling and very delicious. You have to ask for the sweet and sour sauce. I usually get the general tso chickens with rice and it's always filling and filled to the rim.  We always come back here every time we want Chinese food because it is always good."}
{"text":"After living in the area for so long and never trying Chan An, I decided to give it a go a few weeks back. Glad I did, because I'm now a fan.  It's definitely better than Phong May House (see my review if you want to compare). I think my initial reservations about going here revolved around what it looked like from the outside, and to some degree what it looks like on the inside as well. It's in the Crafton Ingram Shopping Center and it looks like a dive. But it's a great dive. There are tables for dine-in eating, but I'd say more than 90% of Chan An's business is take out. They don't do delivery.  But that's no big deal, as the food is always ready in about ten minutes, unless they're really busy, in which case it'll be twenty. So what's good here?  Well, for starters, I love the wonton soup. Chan An uses a dark broth that is actually packed with flavor, unlike all the other Chinese eateries in the area which stick to a chicken-based broth, which is always flavorless for the most part. I don't get how that happens. Someone please explain it to me. The lack of flavor, not the base, that is.  I'm a fan of the sweet and sour pork here, as well as the cashew chicken. I've noticed Chan An likes to use lightly battered dark meat pieces of chicken with a darker sauce when it comes to some of their dishes such as the cashew chicken. It can sometimes be a little salty, but most days it's right on the money. Plus they also throw in water chestnuts, which I love and wish more Chinese restaurants would do.  The egg rolls are really good. Not greasy, not overdone, but just right. The fried wontons are good and the beef on the stick is amazing. It's not your usual beef on a stick. Well, it is, but then they wind up deep frying the beef before skewering it, and I've never had it like that, but it's really tasty. It bring out the sweetness of the beef really well.  The people who run the place are super friendly and they'll do their best to accommodate your tastes if you want something made a little differently. The prices are good and in line with other affordable Chinese restaurants. So don't let the look of the place fool you. Chan An does a lot of business and I'd say that's mostly down to the quality of their food. Convenience is nice, too, but that doesn't always make for tasty eats. So give these guys a try if you've been on the fence about 'em like I was. I dig their vittles.   UPDATE: 12/22/2014  I'm upping my review of Chan An's to five stars (from four). It's become my regular go-to stop for quick and tasty Chinese food. The whole place is like one big happy family between the employees and the clientele. Everyone who goes is pretty much a regular.  A couple nights ago, I went and after I came in and placed my order, a small army arrived behind me. It got rather crowded quickly with everyone standing around waiting to get their takeout. At one point, the cashier was trying to tell one of the customers where the various sauce packets were and saw that there was one packet of soy sauce left in the bin. I offered to help him restock, and he directed me to where they kept all the packets. I was soon refilling the bins as fast as I could. It was amusing. It's that kind of place.  I returned again last night and te same guy and I talked a bit while I was waiting for my order. He had gone to the Strip District earlier in the day and bought some cheese. So we started discussing our mutual love for cheese, and I directed him to Wheel and Wedge and their great cheeses. He sliced off a piece of his Strip District cheese and handed it to me to share. It was tasty. I know this has nothing to do with Chan An's food, but it's this sort of laidback and enjoyable experience that keeps me coming back as much as the vittles."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place. It's your typical greasy spoon Chinese takeout joint. Located in a strip mall, it's very convenient to access and parking is plenty. Our regular order consists of lo-mein and chicken wings. IMHO, they pass...they're tasty but by no means the best in the city.    There are tables here if you choose to dine in. Worth a stop if you are in the mood for something quick and filling."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a solid two. It's your classic American Chinese fare. The tastes were off and the food was over cooked (maybe it was reheated). You're better off picking up a frozen PF Chang's meal from the Walmart freezer section."}
{"text":"Chan An is a hole in the wall establishment tucked into a corner of the unremarkable Crafton-Ingram shopping plaza.  That being said, Chan An serves up some of the best Chinese food you can find in the west end.  I am very partial to their bean curd, it is delicious (it's all I usually get!). Their egg rolls are also some of the best I've had, very light and crispy, very fresh.  The dining area itself is nothing special but is very clean."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is listed in the North Side and has the wrong zip code, but all of the other info is correct, which is good!   My co-workers and I ordered from their lunch menu yesterday where all meals were under $6! When I went to pick up the food I received a box filled with food for $20. I was in disbelief!   When I got it back to the office I saw that they threw in 2 free egg rolls, a nice touch for an egg roll fan like me!   We were all impressed with the quality and quantity of our meals!   We're already talking about ordering from there again this week!"}
{"text":"Food is good , but just for 3 stars . All dishes taste almost same .  Curry spicy noodle is best."}
{"text":"I live in the area and their Chinese is good, I don't order anything meat but I get chicken and broccoli minus the chicken (lol) and it's good and the veggie fried rice and lo mein are also really tasty"}
{"text":"been going there off and on for 18 yrs. good inexpensive food. good service.  recommend it"}
{"text":"Not bad..     I work and live very close to this place and have orded about 3 or so times here in the past couple of momths. Take out i add...i wont eat inside lol kind of germy and not my cup of tea when it comes to dining.     last i ordered the general tsos chicken dinner portion. These people hook it up when it comes to portion. Chicken was good, too much sauce though..sodium heaven. I would def keep ordering take out here. Although if i wasnt living in the area i probably would forget about thia place."}
{"text":"From time to time I'll get an insane craving for some lo mein. Thankfully Chan An Restaurant is right down the block in my neighborhood, and I can get there on a whim. Not like it's my favorite place in the world, but it'll get the job done if I want something relatively cheap, convenient, and close to home.   The lo mein here is fabulous. It comes loaded with veggies or whatever meat or seafood from the menu you choose to add. You can't substitute fried rice for the standard white rice, but you can sub lo mein with your meal. Another positive is that Chan An is very generous with their portions. I've ordered from here on more than one occasion, and unfortunately they do not deliver or I'd probably order at least once a week.  My boyfriend's favorite Asian chicken dish is definitely orange or honey chicken, and I'm not going to argue with that. Chan An does not have either of those sauces, but their General Tso's is good. The pieces of chicken left a bit to be desired after my last meal there, as they were small and kind of dry. Overall, Chan An is a decent deal for the price. My boyfriend has a huge appetite, and one order of General Tso's and lo mein fed both of us. The free egg rolls with our meal were also great! Chan An's lo mein will have me visiting again when my craving strikes!"}
{"text":"If you have to read the menu, then you may never have been to any take out Chinese restaurant in the past 30 years.  They must keep printing costs down by using it in 1000s of restaurants across the U.S.    Prices are ok.  You will be just under $10 for a combo with fried rice, egg roll, and drink.   The General Tsos here is actually a little different than most.  The sauce is not as red and sweet as some. It's more brown and spicy.  It was different than expected but good.   The service was very good.  The lady that took my order was polite and attentive.  After arriving I decided to eat in just to save time and she immediately brought my drink and egg roll over to my table. It was crisp and not greasy.  But good.   The rest was served in the tiny silver takeout tray.  At first I was surprised, but when I realized I wasn't going to finish my meal, it made sense to serve it this way. When she noticed I wasn't eating anymore she brought over a lid and a bag to take home.    They stayed fairly busy while I was here and quickly served people and got the take outs quickly turned around.    There aren't many other options in the area but if you want take out, this is worth a try."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant and was very excited for my General Tso's that did not taste good at all. And the rice tasted old. I did let the staff know and they did not seem to care in helping. They basically made it seem as if I was the problem. I let them know that I enjoyed the egg roll and fried crab wonton.  Needless to say, I will not return. I'm not a fan at all."}
{"text":"Chan Am of Crafton. A So-So Chinese restaurant. Absolutely nothing special about this place. The Lunch Special for 5.35 isn't too bad, though. I tried the General Tso's(of course) and it was not the tastiest I've ever had(-1). They are eat in and pick up only(-1). All in All, if I'm desperate I might order again, but probably not."}
{"text":"Full menu of cheap Chinese food to satisfy your usual hungry-in-the-South-Side cravings. They have some good (re: cheap) combination lunch deals that include just about anything you're interested in. They pack the aluminum to-go tray pretty heavily to ensure a healthy trip to the bathroom a few hours later. The storefront itself has a small amount of seating.  Good for a hangover; not so good for a client lunch. Still probably better than any quick options at the Dirty Bird next door. There are better alternatives on East Carson Street...but there's always a soft spot in my belly for some greasy 'n' cheap Chinese."}
{"text":"I have been ordering here since I was little. Their Generl Tso's is my favorite. Other favorites: pork fried egg roll, fried won ton and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The lunch prices are awesome. The dinner is more expensive but the same portion as lunch - so try to get there during lunch hours. My only complaint is that they do not deliver."}
{"text":"I was starving and between errands so stopped in for a quick chicken fried rice. Disgusting. There was zero flavor... I added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something. The chicken had a grayish color and no carrots, peas or egg. Only bean sprouts and onion, I ate about a quarter of it and pitched it. Never again. How hard is fried rice?"}
{"text":"Chan An has the best cheap, fast, and yummy Chinese Food in the area. The owner is always very pleasant, and you can tell she cares about her customers  we order from here at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this restaurant for many years. We love their food. I love the people who own the restaurant; I've literally watched their children grow up as I would go to get my pick up order. And in all these years they have never made a mistake in our order. You know exactly what you're getting here every time--tasty food, inexpensive, and prepared quickly."}
