{"text":"Terrible experience here. We went in for gyro as not all of the greek places in the area serve it and we had a craving. They have gyro on the spit, but you don't get that gyro. Apparently, to save money this place pre-slices their gyro and stores the slices in a steam table. They then attempt to reheat them for you on the grill. This results in dried out husks of gyro the consistency of roof shingles.   Sides were fine. Greek salad was average. Can't speak to other menu items but I won't be returning to try any."}
{"text":"Staff were very friendly. Had the falafel.  It was good. Lots of seating. Spacious clean restaurant.  I would recommend this place."}
