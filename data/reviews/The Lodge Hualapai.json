{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice. Good variety of music. My fiance and I came in for a late night meal. I had the cheeseburger with onion rings. I do like all the additional items you can add to the Burger. I added grilled onions, Swiss, and mushrooms. In all my meal was pretty good. We started off with the chicken wings which were also pretty good. The service was the best feature here. The only complaint I have is that the staff was hanging around the bar getting drunk. It seemed pretty unprofessional and kind of rude."}
{"text":"When our bartender moved to this location, we tried to follow suit, but it just wasn't the same.  The clientele wasn't what we were used to, and it was smaller.  Still, the food and drinks were good."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, close to my work. Usually go during the day, nice and mellow, but sometimes the bartender is the server as well it looks like so if she gets more than 3 tables she can become frazzled. But the food is always good, lots of it too. I keep going back, and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Not a bad atmosphere, didn't smell very smokey. Make sure to review your check if you're gambling. I had to tell the bartender before she would comp my drinks. Then when getting my check, Doreen said that even though I put in $45 and walked away with $40 of it- they don't normally comp for that. I only had a beer and a shot..then bought food. So just because I won some of my money back I don't get my drinks comped?! That's ridiculous. Why would anyone return to this place knowing they get punished for winning some of their money back? But then again, I wasn't taking car bombs with her like the guys on the other side of the bar. Very professional. Go down the street to Pts instead. They seem to value their customers a bit more."}
{"text":"Use to be a great bar. Still has great bartenders, but new management really drove out good locals. Machines are now tight, food comps gone, wish it was the Old Lodge :("}
{"text":"Place used be fun with good food. It's depressing with crap food (news flash maybey change the grease in the fryer once a year so your fries don't taste fishy ) usually less than 3 people in the spot will still take 15 min per drink. It sucks becouse its,with in walking distance of my home."}
{"text":"Food is great, staff is great, but they really should clean the chandeliers above the bar"}
{"text":"Ok so, the food was toilet homeless leftover.. i actually asked him to throw the burger and fries away after i decided not to take it with me.. the wings were cold and someone in the back decided to pour a ton of salt on top of them... my beer was stail. But..  Stewart .....the owner.... needs his ass whooped.. he use to have quality establishments across the valley... i must say Bryan was awsome.. the best bartender.. he's wasting his talents in this morgue sad ass place."}
{"text":"The menu on-line in NOTHING like the restaurant's menu. The food was good diner food. Service was a little slow as it was past lunch but before dinner. Able to make accommodations to ordered items without drama."}
{"text":"First time at this location, crowd is kinda weird but attentive and friendly bartender! Definitely heavy pours which is nice:) much better than the Henderson location"}
{"text":"Be careful, the bartender may post your pictures and bash you on social media as she did to my friend....Sad and childish"}
{"text":"I went into this bar once.   They immediately let me know my business was not welcome. They cater only to gamers. Ignored me for several minutes when I first walked in. They gave me attitude, and this bar is not smoker friendly!  I will never go back. I have heard horrible reviews from many of my friends.   Go to the bar a few blocks away, instead!  Worst experience ever in a bar."}
{"text":"Friendly bartender, clean, food was decent. Pretty big compliment for a Lodge since most consider them a low rent PTs. Will try again. Seems like most of bad reviews were either by drunk people or people without autocorrect on their phones. Take them with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Been to this spot a few times before just for a couple drinks and really enjoy the environment. So, after last night we were treated rudely by the bartender at the PTS down the street, we came here and had the time of our lives. The customer service, food, and drinks was just absolutely perfect. Can't argue with the prices and will definitely be making this a regular spot, and thanks to the grave yard shift bartender on 4/10/15..!"}
{"text":"Bars owned by the Lodge Group are nicely decorated and seem to have a good atmosphere. The only concern I have is that the prices are much higher than you would expect for drinks"}
{"text":"The Lodge at Hualapai is convenient locals bar in the South Summerlin area.  They appeal to the typical beer drinker that wants typical cold beer and nothing more.  They have some inexpensive food specials during televised games (professional & collegiate) such as tacos, wings, sliders.  They are certainly a bargain.  There are several drink specials as well, though they are not as good as the food specials.  They have a couple pool tables that are often open waiting for customers to use.  The staff is friendly and welcoming...other than that this and the previous highlights is nothing real special calling you to come here."}
{"text":"We walked in the door, stepped up to the bar to check out the selection of  brew on tap and promptly decided it was entirely too smoky to even bother pulling out the bar stool and having a seat. The air was thick with smoke and I honestly can't believe we stayed as long as we did. (Which was probably less than three minutes.) If you are a non-smoker, my suggestion to you is skip this place all together."}
{"text":"I love coming to this bar. I drive all the way from Southern Highlands for the good people and good service.. tonight however I was appalled... the manager, mark (?) Was trashed and making a fool of himself and the bar. Treated his staff as his own personal servers and had total disregard for the customers in the bar.. profanities and other unholy words were shouted loud for all to hear while he made demands to \"ABS\".. if it wasn't for the excellent bartenders here, I might never come back."}
{"text":"Always good food service and atmosphere. Check this bar out if you like kicked back people and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sat down and started playing a machine.  It was nearly 10 minutes before I was even acknowledged.  Even then it wasn't by the bartenders, they were too busy flirting with the male customers,  but by the food server.  She went behind the bar even though she wasn't supposed to in order to get me a beer. I was there about an hour,  eating and playing. I was never ONCE even talked to by either bartender the entire time. Not,  hello,  how are you doing,  do you need another drink, nothing!  Guess what stupid girls,  women can tip just as well as men,  most of the time better.  The server got a hefty tip from me tonight! Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Rex Marvin has a weakness.  Okay, don't look at me that way.  I will start again.  Rex Marvin has many weaknesses. One that might shock you...okay...they would all shock you. This one would surprise you...okay...most of them would surprise you. Fine, I will just say it.  I have a thing for ski lodges.  Before you snicker. Before you judge. Before you call me horrible names and question my street cred and make me cut you...let Rex explain.  Imagine a young Rex. Imagine a young taut schoolboy with golden locks. Imagine a fat kid next to that good looking kid.  Guess which one was Rex.  They are standing on a hill. The hill is covered with snow. The snow is white. Show White is white.  Sorry, I got carried away...I digress.  A girl walked by. She was a vision. It wasn't a great vision but a vision nonetheless.  She smiled. I smiled. She smiled again. I smiled again. She smiled a third time. I thought she was retarded. She might have been. We skied. We talked. She talked more. Then...it happened. I disrobed. She disrobed. She saw the knife scar.  I saw the stretch marks.  We consummated our disgust.  It was sweet. It was sad. It was short. It was physically painless. It was emotionally numb. It was psychologically scarring. Still, I look back on those innocent times with longing and fondness.  Lodge at Hualapai looks like that ski lodge. It looks like the place where that morbid little troll stole my innocence. It is where after she left I huffed my first can of paint. The first time I cried the tears of shame...and liked it.   Lodge is great...if you like wood. Nay, if you LOVE wood.  It is a little intense for those people who don't see wood as the greatest substance in the world.  It is a good place.  There are plenty of tv's to watch games, a great separate pool table area away from the customers and plenty of seating.  It also has a great fireplace in the winter.  The food and drinks are above the average bar food.  Their wings are meaty and the sauce is great.  Their sandwiches are very good and their dinners are solid but not spectacular.  Where the Lodge really excels is breakfast.  When you are on your third straight night with no sleep, sitting on the same bar stool, and fading in and out of consciousness while screaming about tiny fat chicks some food is a necessity. It is cheaper than bail.  The food is great, the prices are good. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day...especially when your face is covered with paint and your eyes can't focus.   The bartenders make a good drink, not great, but good. The locals aren't exactly treated like they are needed...and they are, and there is very rarely a decent special...but it is a good place to go when there is nowhere else...or somewhere else very close throws you out for threatening to punch Betty White...and Betty White isn't even there. The concept of no harm no foul means nothing to those bastards.  Rex drinks here. Rex dulls the memories here. Rex eats here. Rex isn't really proud of it."}
{"text":"We love the lodge. Always friendly bartenders. Relaxing atmosphere. We always meet great people here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Food, amazing place. It's always empty and it's such great place, feel like you're dinning in your own private restaurant.... I love it. The breakfast is amazing as well..."}
{"text":"This place was a mixed bag. Allow me to explain.  Went for dinner and we were the only 2 people in the restaurant section.  Remember that fact, cuz it will come into play later.  I ordered a steak wrap with French fries and my hubby ordered a Cajun chicken pasta. After the waitress left, my hubby realized she didn't take his salad order, which the menu said came with his entree. He went over and told her and she said, \"Oh they stopped serving salads with that...but it DOES say it on the menu, so I'll go tell them to make one.\" Weird occurrence #1.  When the food came, my wrap was served with onion rings, not the fries I ordered. Weird occurrence #2. I told the waitress it was fine and I would eat them. The wrap was pretty damn tasty and the onion rings were nice and crispy, not soggy.  My husband's Cajun CHICKEN pasta...had no chicken in it! Weird occurrence #3. However, the pasta was pretty damn tasty anyway.  So, the food was really good and the waitress was really nice and personable, BUT they messed up on our order three times when were literally the ONLY people in the restaurant.  See what I mean about a mixed bag?"}
{"text":"It's comparable to all other local bars, but gave 3 stars because it isn't as popular. Less people, less energy."}
{"text":"Okay went there with the bf this time and the waitress informed us that food was half off! Which was around midnight. We had the nachos with chicken and mini burgers. As far as bar food goes, it was good! But overall we were there for the drinks and this bartender (a new one for me) was good! He made sure our drinks were perfect :) THANKS AGAIn! :)"}
{"text":"Oh boy! What a health code nightmare.  If that doesn't bother you, then the food is good.    Three of us went in for lunch.  We were the only table in the dining room.  The bartender/server was standing at the bar eating a sandwich.  She would come over to our table, practically still chewing, when I shot a look her way.  People are smoking and there isn't a division between dining and bar????  The cook brought out our food - after quite a while.  I never saw anyone wash their hands.  The bartender would stop eating, serve someone a drink, and go back to leaning on the bar and eating her sandwich.  The other bartender was bust getting cigarettes out of the vending machine.  Yowsa!  All that aside, food was good for your average bar food.  Good fries.    If you think that all that is a laugh, and you are into this kind of extreme casual atmosphere, then you would like this bar.  They do have lots of advertised specials like free mimosas with sunday brunch and $1 taco nights."}
{"text":"This sucks because I usually never write reviews let alone negative ones. But there is a first for everything. I'm sure everyone will have their own experience but I would challenge the manager or anyone to contact me regarding my simplistic issue.  I'm very familiar with the chain and visit often as I am a Vegas local and in the same industry. 11:35am Dec 15th I order a steak and eggs meal with a special request for cheese mixed inside the eggs and not just layed on top. I've made this request at several locations that I've been to other then this one and every restaurant I go to in general for that matter not just The Lodge. The bartender places the order but once it comes out explains that the cook said he can only lay it on top because he doesn't want to burn his pans with cheese. LOL (I couldn't make this up)   I then asked the bartender to have the cook come and explain that to me because That statement just doesnt make sense to me. Not to mention they should've stated that before bringing the food out and offering me another option. She then goes in the back, comes out and says \"he probably wont come out but he said he only has 1 pan left and doesn't want to take the risk of ruining it.\" (Once again I couldn't make this up if I tried!) I then stated mixing cheese in with the eggs would never ruin a pan! (Common sense)   Although she (the bartender) comped my meal I was looking for sum delicious cheese eggs, not a free meal! At the end of the day I wouldn't return to this location but will still go to others: Absurd and disrespectful would be a few ways to describe my experience.   Btw the bartender was great and I could tell she felt bad for the kitchens decisions but her hands were tied."}
{"text":"Former F&B Director in San Diego and Las Vegas. Friendly staff.  Bill-Bartender, Tammy-server, incredibly efficient and friendly. Other service staff I've come across, they too, are very courteous.  You definitely hired the right people. Keep up the good work. Doug"}
{"text":"I found a stellar jalapeno burger here! The burger was meaty and juicy.  It comes with salsa but I chose to have that left off. My husband got the same burger with salsa and it was super messy! I can't stand messy burgers. You can always get the salsa on the side but I thought the burger was spicy enough without it."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Lodge's in town and this one was great. We had an impromptu dinner request to hang out with a friend who recently moved back into town and The Lodge Hualapai was our choice. We came in, sat down and our bartender/waitress was super sweet and patient. The bar itself was sort of busy, not crazy but nice.  Our party couldn't stop talking/catching up so it took a second for us to put our order in and she had no problem checking up on us and getting our drinks with an awesome attitude.   We ended up ordering a Lodge burger w/ cheese and ($8 plus another $1 for the cheese), a Pastrami Reuben sandwich ($10), a Patty Melt sandwich on sourdough ($10) and a Grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque ($7). Our order came out relativity quickly, although I was told that the Grilled Cheese was luke warm, almost cold, the Patty Melt was good but with a lot of onion, the Reuben was good as well but also slightly cold, and the burger was good too no issues there.  Our waitress informed us she was getting off her shift so our new bartender would take the tab when we were finished. We then proceeded to go up to their pool tables. The tables were clean, no issues and a couple hours later we paid our bill and left and the new bartender was very polite, no problems. Overall, good experience, good food for the price and awesome employees! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to local bar. I have been coming here once/twice a week for about 4 months. The service is always fast, the food is always hot and they are good about comping drinks when you play at the bar. It has an awesome lounge area near the bar and pool tables. Its great for socializing. It isnt for the foodie, but its great for a quick bite and a good time.   Try: The  Meatballs The Soups The grilled cheese   Pass:  On the chicken tenders. They are pretty bland and dry."}
{"text":"Another lodge in Vegas - at least you know what you're going to get when you walk into these chain of lodges.  I had the Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich \"Marinated grilled chicken breast, fresh avocado, swiss cheese, apple wood bacon, red onion, tomato, and sprouts.  Served with mayo, on a fresh, baked roll.\" ($8.95) for lunch.  It's served with your choice of fries, onion rings, cole slaw, or side salad.  I went for the side salad and always appreciate when it's a decent side salad.  I tried this sandwich at the other lodge and appreciated the marinated moist chicken.  The apple wood bacon really makes this sandwich though.  The Husband tried their Quesadilla with Seasoned Tri-Tip \" Stuffed with cheddar/jack cheese, green chillies, and your choice of chicken or seasoned tri-tip.  Served with sour cream and salsa.\" ($8.95)  You can also get this with chicken.  He tried their tri-tip in the sandwich form and wanted a bit of variation.    Overall, food was decent and service was fine.  They have specials going on, so it's worth checking out their daily board."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite with my sister and her hubs.  They've been here a few times and got their usuals-grilled cheese and bbq wrap.  I am visiting and have never been here before.  I ordered a burger.  The burger was ok, pretty standard. the fries were good too. i couldnt stop eating them.  But someone must have put a toothpick in my burger and lost half of it and decided not to say anything. Or someone dropped half a toothpick into the meat before cooking. I'm not really sure. but i took a bite of the burger and had half of a toothpick in my mouth.  I know accidents happen so i dont usually make a big deal when this sorta stuff happens. Plus my sister and her hubs have been here numerous times without complaint. So I'm still giving this place 3 stars. But if my sister asks where I want to eat I'm probably not going to say this place."}
{"text":"hotiyaki wings are great. service for food tonight by Anna was terrific attentive and happy to be there. Unfortunately the barstaff Not attentive. I just needed a refresh on my bud light in a bottle but the bartendng staff was as they said \"doing something\" so Anna got my $$ go for the food but dont expect attentive bar staff"}
{"text":"I'm normally lenient when it comes to food & beverage service as certain circumstances are beyond your control as a previous employee food & beverage employee but these female bartenders fuckin suck! No customer service. Leave the bar unattended to use their cell phone. Stay away from Asian female and big white female bartenders, unless you want to get ignored.  I'm all for girl power but not today after this. Didn't feel welcomed. Spent $70 here to eat, drink and watch the game and regretted it. I'll spend my $70 elsewhere"}
{"text":"If you live in the area is a great place to get out of your claustrophobic home and eat something also have a drink. Nobody bother you here, the pay outs gambling are very good too"}
{"text":"Love the food and all the ladies!!!! HATE HATE HATE the graveyard bartender ..... Have has four yes four different and each time awful interactions with him! Guarantee he cost them business nightly!!!!!"}
{"text":"Blatant disregard for customers safety and security by management. Continuing to serve and not calling for cab or UBERs for customers. Would not recommend the property anymore after being sent home with an individual I didn't know and robbed."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this location.  Great bartenders, Christina, Abbie, Doreen, Laura and Jessica!  You ladies know how to make a customer feel \"special\".  Will spread the word what a great place this is to eat, drink and gamble. Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Lots of choices on the menu from breakfast to brunch to dinner in 24 hours seven waitress is a nice and full. The only drawback is there are too many good options on the menu so hard to pick from breakfast to Dinners."}
{"text":"As promised in my previous review, we returned to The Lodge á deux.  We were happy to find a place with a full menu after seeing the Glittering Lights at the Speedway not long before they closed.  The place was quiet, with a table of 3 the only other diners, and about 10 people at the bar.  They still use the tiny little glasses for wine, though I guess since it was almost full it was probably close to what every other bar pours into a humongous glass.  The waitress had a really tough time answering the most elementary questions about the food, so we just ordered and let the dice roll.  Hubby ordered the rigatoni/chicken entree with a side salad, and I had the chicken, mushroom, jalapeño and cheese sandwich on French roll.  I was able to get a cup of soup as my side instead of fries, and the chicken tortilla soup was singing to me.  My husband's salad was delivered, and I waited and waited for the soup, but couldn't find the waitress.  That's because she was very busy - sitting at the bar chatting up one of the customers way off in the distance. She was a total space cadet.   As I suspected, my soup came in a cup on the same plate as the sandwich.  So I sat having nothing while my husband ate, and then was expected to eat hot soup and a hot sandwich at the same time.  As it turned out, the soup was sooooo hot - both definitions - that I ended up having it for dessert.  I like spicy, but the spice was overwhelming, and it had way too much cream.  Traditional tortilla soup has NO cream.  On the plus side, it was chock full of stuff, so much that I was too full to have more than half.  I like the looks of this place - rustic and cozy.  I like the hours.  And the food's pretty good.  Service, though, needs a lot of improvement."}
