{"text":"3.5 stars!  This review will be short and sweet cuz my experience here was well, short and sweet:  1)Atmosphere: cozy and clean.   2)Service: courteous and prompt. Yes, I want my tea refilled please!  3)Food: Lunch specials are decently priced (around $10). We get appetizers and dessert (nothing fancy but yummy). The dragon roll was delish (fresh and well proportioned with the rice). The salmon teriyaki is better than the 2 pictures I presented - just the right amount of spice (delicate yet tasty). But I forgot to bring my camera the first time (so I don't have a pic of the roll / teriyaki). Will def take more pics next time!  Overall consensus: worth the value. I already have plans to return!"}
{"text":"Do not order the spider roll!!! I went in for pick up & was very disappointed.  The lady could not provide proper directions (she didn't know the difference between North & South).  She called to inform me that my order was ready & I had to wait 10 minutes in order to receive it.  During my wait, I had to use the washroom & it smelt like some died in it.  Don't bother wasting your time or money on this overly priced place."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner last week.  Good food, good price, in a pleasant, casual atmosphere.  The servers were attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I'm not big on Sushi, Sashimi (or anything raw, for that matter) so I'll let the previous reviews do the talking.  That's also why I don't do many reviews on Sushi / Japanese places.  But when I do go for Japanese, I tend to rate them on the quality of their non-raw selection.  My experience with Kagawa has always been courteous and gracious.  I tend to go around lunch time on the weekends, and it's not too busy then.  The staff were more than willing to accommodate our sometimes-larger group upwards of 10 people.  Lunch in particular has a pretty good selection of bento boxes.  The salad in these boxes are pretty good - typical iceberg lettuce and vegetable affairs (somewhat cold from the freezer, but no obvious freezer burns) and tangy with their dressing.  Portions are fair, especially with the beef.  In recent years, however, the price has gone up while the portions have remained the same.  Couple of times, the chicken was dry, and the beef chewy, but overall its well sauced.  Staff are rather friendly, but can sometimes forget about you if you're in one of the hide-away booths at the end.  Now to be absolutely fair, bento boxes are no way to rate a restaurant - but my experience with this restaurant has been solely isolated to these, so take it with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for sushi in Mississauga. They're specialty is putting tempura bits, mashed sushi with sesame seeds plopped on top of certain rolls. I'll let the pics do the talking.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND... - Spicy Salmon Roll - Spicy Tuna Roll"}
{"text":"Apparently this WAS a secret spot for Reg A. But lucky lucky me, I'm a privileged friend because he introduced me to Kagawa. Thank you Reg A.!   I understand why he kept this place a secret. I don't want everyone all up on my favourite places causing ruckus. I can be greedy when it comes to food. I may always share what's on my plate, but I don't necessarily share restos I want to keep to myself so I can avoid a crowd.  No worries. I'm learning how to share the wealth. Hence why, I'm yelpin around!  Go with a group and share everything. You'll all win because everyone will eat a great variety for a small cost. A group of us spent only $16 each, taxes and tip included and we were all stuffed and even had leftovers! We were shocked in disbelief and thought they must have made a mistake on the bill.   When at Kagawa YOU MUST, I repeat YOU MUST order the spicy salmon roll or the spicy tuna roll or both. It comes with a mound of salmon/tuna with tempura bits on top of the rolls. Which makes the portion double it's size! I've never seen a spicy roll made like this. Kagawa really should be charging more for it.   It has a quaint, intimate atmosphere which is great for a date. Plus the service is attentive. If you reside in Mississauga, there's no need to leave the city for great sushi because Kagawa does Japanese cuisine justice."}
{"text":"I usually go to Kagawa for take-out Sushi, so I can't comment on the dining experience. When I do go in for take-out though, the staff is very accomodating, serving tea while you wait for your order. I find that you get A LOT for what you pay, which is great because it takes a lot of sushi to fill me up and I never wind up hungry after I order from here.  Their sushi is also delicious and fresh. I have no complaints! I love the dynamite roll and tempura roll the best, I'd say. I'm not into spicy stuff but my bf has the spicy salmon and quite enjoys it (and claims it's not *that* spicy). Yum!"}
