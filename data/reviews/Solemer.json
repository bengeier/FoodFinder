{"text":"While vacationing in Montreal my family and I came to the Solemer, a close friend reccomeded this place. My family is a party of four adults and two children (six in total). We went into the restaurant from the fish market. We were told we had to pick out the seafood we liked and to have a seat in the Solemer restaurant. We pick 4 medium size fish and 6 pieces of shrimp. So it would be 4 entrees. We asked for the fish to be deep fried. We also ordered rice and salads.  The decor of the restaurant is elegant and very lovely. Our table was large enough to fit the family. We sat by a window and under a giant chandelier.  The waiter seemed odd at first, he kept lurking back and fourth to our table. Not to asked how we are doing or if we needed anything. He would come so close he would see what's on my phone and comment about something that is not his business. He would even often join in on our conversation.  When our food can out it was drenched in butter! The waiter said that that's their special butter sauce. It tasted like plain melted butter which made the fish very soggy and difficult to eat.  When we asked for the check we were in complete shock! Our total was $620. We asked to speak to the manager because that seemed insane! The waiter was not happy that we requested the manager. The waiter said well what did you expect, this is the Solemer! The manager said because we chose our fish we had to purchase it separately and pay for cooking costs and we have to pay for taxes twice. The waiter made sure to come back to let us know that gratuity is not included! He stood by to tel us how much we should pay for gratuity.  Overall this place is not worth the chance of being robbed like we did. Other reviews stated that it's affordable and family friendly. I highly disagree!! I will never return to this place!!"}
{"text":"Very, very good food, service, always fresh! I recommend this place! Loove it! And now they have table d'h√¥te!!!"}
{"text":"We had family style for this lunch.  Nothing about our meal really stood out."}
{"text":"We went at around 3PM, which means the place was completely empty.  The decor was pretty nice, the service was just OK (zero small talk)  We started off with a shrimp appetizer, 6 pieces decent sized for $21  They have a nice Table d'Hote for $21.50 with appetizer, main dish and dessert.  Your experience with the Specials would vary depending on what you get.  My friend had fried calamari, an entire grilled sea bream and dessert.  I had smoked salmon (3 small slices, and the shish kebab (6 cubes).  What brought this to a 4 star was the amazing pudding dessert, it earned a star on it's own.  It shares it's parking with Adonis next door and the pleasant surprise is the take-out counter at the poissonnerie connected to the main restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here for a staff dinner. Overall the food was good, fresh, but nothing special. Having looked at their menu I can say that I won't be back as the food isn't worth it. Service was nice but overall their \"fish market\" is disappointing compared to so many others in the city. There are definitely better places out there for this experience."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, fresh fish, perfect flavour. Appetizer are as good as the main dishes. Service was fast and professional. I definitely will come back. Highly recommended for a delicious Lebanese sea food."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. I'm not too crazy about the decor, it's pretty old fashion. I recommend the kibbe naye, kafta naye & grillades. Fish is great there as well. Takes me back to Lebanon  every time I go there."}
