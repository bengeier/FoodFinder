{"text":"Incredible food. Great prices. Very friendly family owned restaurant.

This restaurant is a must try if you are in the area. The shawarma and pizza are unbelievably tasty! I don't typically write reviews, but I felt obligated to write one for Pizza Zozan, considering, I have eaten there at least 30 times already."}
{"text":"Absulutely love it! Great customer service and wont be beat price. The foot long shawarma is heavenly amazing."}
{"text":"Went: 12:00 pm Tue Aug 11 2015
Ordered: large pepperoni pizza and pide
Cost: $21.00
My date ate here all the time and there was nothing foreign about this place, but I think management changed since then. We went back there on Aug 22 and the lights were not on. Two men who looked like they worked next door told me that the place is closed. That's too bad. They recommended I try a place nearby on cityview. I later found out it is Zagros pita. Maybe I'll give that a try.
I like to look for food that is unique and different and I've never tried pide. The pepperoni pizza was okay. We bought it for family and was not expecting too much. It was good though not outstanding.
I liked the pide though. It is more oval than round and the crust is crispy and thin. It was full of flavour and I could keep eating more and more. I forgot what topics were on it but the basic version was excellent.
I wanted to try the lahmacun from this place, but sadly will not have the chance and will have to go some place else.
Bottom line: I would have (and did) come back to try the different Turkish dishes."}
{"text":"A great local alternative to pizza chain pizza. The owner operators are friendly, and the pizza is tasty and prompt. The crust in particular is great. Overall, a nice local spot for a quick and dependable meal."}
{"text":"It is one of best if not the best pizza and shawarma i ever had. Portions are big with a reasonable price range . I would recommend it too all the foodies in Vaughan  . Keep it up !!"}
