{"text":"We have eaten at Rusconi's several times now. Every time we have been thoroughly impressed. We have been with larger groups and just for date night. Our service was outstanding no matter the size our party. We have tried different menu items (trying suggestions directly from Michael, the chef) and have never been disappointed. From salads to entrees to desserts we have enjoyed everything we have tried. The servers are knowledgeable about the wine list. The cocktails are typically well poured. Every time we have been to Rusconi's, Michael has visited our table, taken time to talk with us, and made suggestions. It is not a cheap night out but don't' think the prices are unreasonable given the quality of the food and the level of service. It is definitely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! I've been here multiple times and was never disappointed! I've also gone just to have a drink at the bar with friends and the bartender was awesome. The bar area and restaurant are small but very quaint. I like that intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Rusconi's for the first time, to celebrate her birthday. It was great! I had the kitchen board and the muscles and my wife had the open face ravioli and the short rib dinner. Everything was perfect and delicious! The prices were also a pleasant surprise, considering the quality of each dish. The service was impeccable and our waiter, Tommy, couldn't have done a better job of making our dining experience more special! He even brought the most delicious chocolate dessert for my wife's birthday to top off our meal, free of charge!! Thanks Tommy! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. Had the salad with  chicken, strawberries and mango over mixed greens. I thought it was a bit small for an entree and skimped on the chicken, strawberries and mango. Also, too much finishing salt was added, any more and I could not have eaten. Good atmosphere though."}
{"text":"The food was great especially the Mac n cheese. Everything was fresh and tasty, kinda like home cooking but stepped up a notch. We got there late so some items were finished. But everything we had was delicious. We were out with another couple and every body was pleased with their choice. When you go, make sure somebody at the table orders the chocolate bread pudding.  The restaurant is clean and airy, we sat on the patio. The server was fun and professional. I will visit rusconi's again and again."}
{"text":"My past two visits to Phoenix I've eaten here.  The food, ambiance and service is excellent.  I've had both brunch and lunch, love the menu selections. We'll be back in April and we already have plans for 8 of us to enjoy dinner here.  Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour one afternoon when my father in law was in town. The food was great and the $3 drafts were a nice touch. The service was good as well. So, why three stars? The barman literally came up to us when we were finishing up  and asked \"so what are you guys going to stick around for dinner or are you going to wrap this up?\" The place was pretty empty, maybe 4 other people there and it felt like we were being rushed out. It just seemed stuffy. I get that it's fancy pants, but it's just food. The food was good so I might be convinced to go back for dinner.   +1 for keeping our water glasses full +1 for taste +1 good happy hour -2 for snotsdale attitude"}
{"text":"Two words. Hidden Gem. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"A quick trip in from Canada, looked inviting from outside. A tremendously friendly greeting at the door. appreciated, dining alone, hub and kiddie back home. Great service  and recommendations  from Josh, as well as lots of information on the beautiful artwork displayed.  Hard to decide what to focus on. Can't wait to introduce this very comfortable, easy , and excellent restaurant to my family in December. Thank you for a lovely dinner. Candace"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before with my husband and with friends for lunch and dinner and had a great experience both times. Good service, great food, nice ambience. So when a friend suggested we try it for a girls brunch, I was excited to try their brunch menu. If I was basing this review off just the brunch experience today, it would be two stars. So, 3 stars reflects the better prior experiences. I would eat here again for the food but only in smaller groups.  We had a 10am reservation for our party of 6 and were seated promptly. The restaurant was pretty empty with maybe 2 or 3 other tables occupied. We ordered drinks at about 10:15 and food about 10 minutes later. The food came out before the drinks - when we asked about them, we were told it took this long because the bartender had to make them from scratch...yet tables seated after we ordered already had their (made from scratch) drinks. No apology for it taking 30 minutes to make 4 drinks.   Most of the food was very tasty. It's a little pricey in my opinion - the main dishes are reasonable, but the side dishes are $$$ ($6 for a bowl of berries!). One of us ordered a salad, which was not good, so stick with the breakfast food at brunch.  When the check came, it was all on one tab. Apparently they have a policy of no more than 4 checks per table. This is fine, but it was not mentioned up front or even when the check was dropped off. We went through the bill and noted which items should be put on which card (I would not have done it this way, but I was holding my toddler at the time). This was apparently very confusing because we did not see our server again for nearly 30 minutes. We flagged down a manager (I believe), who at that point mentioned the 4 check policy. We offered to split out the charges which was ignored. Our server finally returned with our checks and explained that he ended up with $17 that he couldn't figure out what card to put on so he just ate the charge (I would normally feel bad for this and tip to cover it, but given how long it took to get our drinks, not so much).   TLDR: good for couples or a family, not good for larger groups or if you want your drinks quickly. Definitely a disappointing experience today."}
{"text":"Loved it. This was our second time and we will be back again. Their truffle mac n cheese is delish!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food (fresh, simple, beautifully prepared), good prices and great service (very friendly guy, Taylor - thank you). Not in this area often, but would definitely return, and return."}
{"text":"After reading all the yelp reviews I had to try the beef tenderloin medallions with roasted vegetables and truffle mac'n cheese. When the waitress delivered our meals my friends and I were very impressed by the presentation and portion sizes. The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I wasn't planning on clearing my entire plate but I couldn't stop eating, everything was so delicious. We were also impressed by the service, the servers were very attentive and the bartender even delivered our drinks himself. We were so tempted to order the bread pudding for dessert but we were all so full. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp once again. You came thru in recommending a wonderful place. Atmosphere was great and the food was wonderful. I had the steak medallions. Presentation and portion size was perfect. They obviously have wonderful chefs that know how to not only prepare but also combine other foods to make it fantastic.  The only downside was the serving staff. Most were rather young and dressed rather casually for food that looked & tasted more higher end. Our server was a rather young man and his inexperience showed. He was more concerned with his coolness then our table. He was quick to take our order and quick to get his tip but that was about it. Once we received our food we never really saw him again. Would appreciate a more professional/mature staff but would definitely recommend the food and atmosphere to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"A year and a half later still very tasty! Truffle Mac, short rib, green chili risotto. Fantastic service, with well educated menu. Nice local place to keep on the list!"}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch before heading back home this weekend. This was one of the best brunch menus I have seen. They had all the classics, as well as a few specialties. I ate the ginger and lemon pancakes and they were amazing. So much better than normal pancakes, the flavor was out of this world. It was served with hibiscus infused syrup and walnut flavored butter, both added great elements to a usually basic dish. It was very refreshing tasting. Others at the table had the short rib bendict and huevos rancheros. Both of them finished their plates and raved about it. The service was excellent as well. Wish this place was in Dallas!"}
{"text":"I can never say enough good about this place! We took friends this time who just loved it. Whatever we order, it tastes like pure epicurean delight. We will always return here. Just looking forward to our next visit. Sara H"}
{"text":"This is the \"go-to\" spot for my wife and me, if it's not going to be sushi.  This is really upscale food in a casual atmosphere.  We especially like getting an aperitif at the bar before sitting down for a fine meal.  The wine list is full of gems at affordable prices.  Service is always friendly and accommodating, and the staff in in tune with the kitchen - they can modify the recipes very easily.  Fridays are especially crowded so I recommend getting a reservation."}
{"text":"Now at the top of our go to list of restaurants. Went there for lunch with our 20's daughters and had an excellent meal with outstanding service. Cleaned our plates of sandwiches and salads which amazed me because my daughters almost always take home a doggy bag. The BLT was unique with it's fried tomato's and Italian bacon while the green chile pork sandwich was savory and melt in your mouth tender. The warm chocolate bread pudding we split was a huge hit of dueling spoons. Can't beat Rusconi's for great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"New Years Eve, Another GREAT Dinner at Rusconi's! Drove 350 miles from New Mexico to have dinner. It iwas a fixed menu OMG (oh my gosh) the staff was over the top. They were booked but John invited us to have dinner at the bar.  Best table in town....David was so charming we kept adding items to order. Don't miss this outstanding dinning experience. Happy New Year 2014....."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and is presented well. Service is quick and the price is reasonable. Totally would recommend them."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! I just had dinner there and could not stop smiling with every bite. Our server, Hannah, was extremely knowledgable and very enjoyable. We started with bacon wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese, which were out of this world! I had the sea bass and could not get enough of the Demi glase that it came with! My family are sharers and had to take everyone's food, and boy was that a good idea!! Not one person was disappointed!   Very enjoyable experience from start to finish! One of the best places I have been in a very long time."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!! My new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. We came for dinner with a large party and the service was fabulous. Let me just say, the truffle mac & cheese will change your life. I am still dreaming about that and the vanilla-scented potatoes with the fork-tender short ribs! The menu is wonderfully creative and everything we tasted was perfect. Chef Rusconi has a gift! I plan on coming back soon."}
{"text":"We just had our first dinner at Rusconi's American kitchen.    The hostess looked a little sideways when we didn't have a reservation (early on a Saturday night) but greeted us warmly and offered to \"squeeze\" us in.  We got it when we left and realized that the place was packed with lots of people waiting who probably all had reservations.   I had a very hard time choosing an entree because I wanted several of them.  I settled on the rack of lamb with spinach and goat cheese gnocci.  The lamb was encrusted with something and cooked to perfection as was the spinach.  My husband really enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli and my daughter devoured a flatbread pizza.  If you go, the berry empanada dessert  was amazing.  Next time we'll order two rather than one to share three ways.  The service was exceptional, the atmosphere inviting and cool without a hint of pretentiousness.   This is a great addition to the neighborhood.    We will be back.  PS... I commented that this was good for kids.  I should clarify that this was fine for my kid.  She's 11 and never has issues with fine dining or finding something she wants on the menu.  There were the flatbreads (like pizza) and a mac&cheese on the menu."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time dining at Rusconi's and the food was absolutely amazing. Our waiter Don was terrific and very attentive. We will definitely be eating here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Everything we have had here is delicious! We have now been a couple of times, and we loved everything we had. The ambiance and the service are both great as well. We will definitely be back and are so glad to have such a delicious restaurant so close by!"}
{"text":"I loved it so much I am still thinking about my pork belly with vanilla scented grits and poblano glaze. To die for. Small-ish place, great service and the food. Oh, the food! A true neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with some coworkers.  The GM and Chef both stopped by our table to greet and thank us for coming in!  Great service and even better food.  I can't wait to go back and try this place for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible!  I had the pecan wood grilled beef tenderloin medallions with the mac'n'cheese.  My husband had the Sea bass which was the special of the night.  We also had the chocolate bread pudding for dessert and it was so delicious! The butterfly martini was very tasty as well.   Love the atmosphere and the service!  This is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I have to admit the first time we went, the family were not big fans.  Over one year later, we have been back three times in six weeks.  Most recently, August 6, my wife and I sat at the bar and enjoyed Dave's company along with the Scottish salmon and tuna entrees, Romaine salad and the Caramel topped custard, oh ya and of course a few glasses of wine.  Everything was excellent.  So excellent, we were back on the 13th for exactly the same meal, except we both opted for the salmon this time...again excellent and we were pleasantly surprised with the price.  Thank you for being bringing a great place to the north phoenix restaurant desert!  Highly recommended for dinner and it looks like they have a great happy hour too. Dave is a great bartender-friendly and great service!"}
{"text":"Rusconi's American kitchen is a gem.  It is fine dining restaurant with the head chef in the dining room taking food from kitchen before it is served. We had a big group for diner so basically tried almost everything on their entrees menu.  Every dish that came out was so delicious.  They also have a good selection of food for kids as well. Our waiter was super friendly and very attentive. The service made our dining experience over the top.   Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Lured in by the fixed price Restaurant Week menu, we enjoyed a surprisingly fantastic dinner here.  Located in a busy strip mall, we were skeptical as we approached but were immediately set at ease after we walked in. The interior is very upscale with an open kitchen, sit down bar, and is larger inside than what it appeared from the parking lot.  We each tried one of the three appetizers, entrees, and deserts that were featured and were not disappointed with anything (nor was there a morsel left on any of the plates!)  We were able to try the mushroom soup (could have used a little more salt and a fresh herb garnish), corn polenta with shrimp, and roasted beet salad along with the braised short ribs, fresh sea bass, and beef tenderloin medallions with goat cheese polenta.  The wines suggested to go with the entrees were perfect, wait staff was excellent, and ambiance superb.  We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and my first experience was ok. I went about a year ago. I got the roasted chicken and it was dry but I should have known that was a possibility. It's hard to do pan roasted bone-in chicken to order. The group I was with all loved their dishes. The apps we got were good including the \"kitchen board.\"  So I went again tonight with my husband and we enjoyed our meals very much. In fact, we loved them! We started with the fondue. It was very tasty. They served it with grilled bread which I love. My husband got the Scottish salmon with blackberry sauce. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, as ordered. Delicious! I got the beef medallions with the truffle mac and cheese. It was awesome! My beef was cooked perfectly medium rare and the mac and cheese was delicious. It was flavorful and unusually light for such a rich side dish. It wasn't all thick and gummy like mac and cheese can tend to be. My only criticism was that both dishes, salmon and beef medallions including their accompaniments, needed a tad more salt. Otherwise they were near perfect! For dessert we shared the dark chocolate bread pudding. Oh so light in texture, bold chocolatey flavor with a creamy vanilla sauce on the bottom. I've had their budino before and it's great too!  I would give this place 5 stars but since the food was lacking in seasoning just slightly I gave it 4 stars. Overall so glad we found this place. It's got great food, modern but simple decor and it's close to home. Yay!!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Excellent food and a friendly atmosphere! We met the owner and Chef outside one afternoon and they were super friendly and invited us to come check the place out when it opened. So we did and they remembered us and treated us with nothing but kindness. This will definitely be our new spot!! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and delicious food. Perfect portions. Chef even took us to our table- delightful!"}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant if you're looking for a casual atmosphere with a delicious menu.  We stopped in for a happy hour drink and decided to try some of the apps. The bartender made some great recommendations for us, and we weren't let down.  Would also like to mention that Dave, the bartender was very accommodating!  He surprised me with a cocktail that he overheard me talking about to my husband. It was a great surprise and definitely made a good impression on us. We'll def be going back for an actual lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for brunch.  I had the Arizona toast and a Bloody Mary.  Both were excellent.  We had great service and the atmosphere is comfortable.  We will definitely be back.  Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"What a remarkable evening! Our waiter, Jay, listened and responded to our preferences. Service was gracious and friendly. Appetizer of grilled asparagus , entrees of  rack of lamb and pork tenderloin, wine pairings, and desserts of chocolate bread pudding and budino were each impeccably prepared and presented. The restaurant itself was busy on a Wednesday night, yet we were able to hear our own conversation,  even tho we sat next to a party of eight. There appeared to be regulars as well as first time diners. A well deserved 5 stars! And yes, a hearty endorsement."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! I try to go here at least once a month for their awesome truffle fries. Their happy hour is a fantastic deal."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Rusconi's a few weekends ago. My wife ordered the ancho roasted chicken sandwich, and after only a few bites, she noticed that the sticker from one of the avocados was actually in the sandwich. When we told the waiter, he had the manager come over to our table to explain the situation. The manager apologized and told us that \"obviously the sticker shouldn't have been in the sandwich\", which seemed a little insulting because we knew the sticker shouldn't have been on the sandwich. I was more surprised to see the sandwich still on the bill when it came time to pay. We didn't even get a discount on the bill, or a percentage off the next time we came in. There was a sticker in my wife's sandwich! I would think that warrants some sort of compensation. Obviously the manager didn't know how to correctly handle the situation, and needless to say, we won't be going back to Rusconi's. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from the Bay Area and am surprised by all the chain eateries. Myself and 2 friends came here to check things out and am pleasantly surprised. We decided to go for HH specials and were very pleased. We were greeted by very professional hostess and bartender. I like that the HH menu is simple but diversified, something for everyone. We bellied up and enjoyed the ride, my favorites are the mussels and pork belly with grits. The atmosphere is clean, crisp but inviting. Can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Had the most fantastic dinner.  I had the ahi special, my sister-in-law had mouth watering scallops.  For dessert I had the chocolate creme brûlée...unbelievable! Must go again...soon."}
{"text":"An awesome surprise. Driving around looking for dinner while staying at an in-town resort for a weekend stay-cation. I ordered the chicken with green chile mac & cheese. It was incredibly good. Dark chocolate bread pudding for dessert made me a happy camper. Very reasonably priced for the food quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  It doesn't look like anything special from the outside but once you get in you can tell how nice it is.  The menu was different, modern, but had plenty of choices for someone that's a simple eater like me.  Everything from the apps to dessert was delicious.  One of the nicest dinners I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! Great food great service and especially great bartenders that can pair up the perfect beer with your entree choice! The short rib sliders are the absolute best!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. The food is great and the service, outstanding. If I lived in Phoenix, I would totally be a regular of this place."}
{"text":"We were in town from Seattle and had heard Chef Rusconi had opened his own place.  We had visited him several times at Lon's.  We were so thrilled with our experience!  The service was very good and the food was wonderful and the portions were perfect!  I think people in our \"Super Sized\"  world have unrealistic ideas when it comes to dining at a Real restaurant with fresh quality ingredients.  We will be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"After finding this place on yelp, it gets good reviews,  We gave it a try for happy hour. I give it all the stars!  Great atmosphere, soft wood floors, wood top tables and bar.  great lighting,  great service, Tommy the bartender is great. I do think we got double charged for a couple drinks, but next time we'll request tabs for each person.  That solves that. The food is very very good..  Half price glasses of wine for happy hour. They have Dreaming Tree Cabernet.Yummy yum yum. We will be back. When we walked in at 5 pm, it was empty, but Tommy told us there were 80 resevations coming. Obviously this place has caught on. Try it , I think you'll like it"}
{"text":"I found the little hole in the wall through Yelp and I'm glad I did! From the outside it's nothing spectacular and wouldn't go there to sit on the patio as it over-looks a parking lot. Once walking through the door it was immediately apparent this wasn't just a hole in the wall but a hidden gem. Inside the restaurant opened-up into an open kitchen and great little dining room.   We sat at a small table across from the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender (I think his name was Bobby). Since we had already had drinks and appetizers elsewhere we were slow to order drinks, Bobby saw I was having trouble finding a drink (They don't have much Rum there) so he brought me a small snifter of what he called moonshine and it was delicious! Although I didn't order any cause I needed to drive home, just the thought of letting me try something that was specific to his bar was awesome. BTW it wasn't like drinking rubbing alcohol, it was really really good and if I didn't need to drive home I would have had a whole glass!  For dinner we asked Bobby for recommendations and without hesitation he said the Bison Sirloin, I hadn't even looked at it but since he was so confident I'd like it that's what I chose. The other meal was the House Burger and it was obviously hand-made there and even though simple was a great meal! Both dishes were cooked perfectly, I would have only asked for a little more sauce to dip my bison in. Overall both meals were fantastic as was the service during the meal.  If you're looking for a little place with great service and an interesting menu try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been there twice now.  First had the Buffalo Sirloin, 2nd time had the NY Strip.  I love his accompaniments as they are different and very good but, his main dish on both have been disappointing.  Both cuts of meat were made more flavorful by what they were served with and could not stand alone.  The NY was thin a flavorless, the Buffalo - the same.  For a gentleman coming off years at Lons, I expect a little bit more than thin, flavorless main dishes.  Also, unless you feel like a Creme Brulee with the consistency of chocolate mouse, I would stay away from the Chocolate Creme Brulee dessert.  If you go at night, don't expect quick service.  It is slower so be prepared to just relax and enjoy your meal.  It's a wonderful addition to the area and he has great ideas, I just think he needs to tweak a few items on the menu."}
{"text":"When Rusconi's recommends that you make a reservation, be sure to take their advice to ensure that you have a table upon arrival. We arrived a little earlier than our reso and ordered a drink at the bar. The bartender was out of Luxardo as well as basil, so our 2 choices of cocktails were nixed fairly quickly.   After being seated, we ordered 2 orders of the short rib appetizer. Hands down the most tender short rib I have ever had.  For dinner we ordered the lamb, served with fava beans, gnocci, and mushrooms, as well as the filet medallions with white truffle mac and cheese with a side of bacon brussels sprouts. There wasn't a single remnant of food on any of the plates when we were done. SO DELICIOUS.   For dessert we couldn't choose just one, so we ordered 3. The vanilla budino with cinnamon whipped cream, the creme brulee, and the star of the show, the dark chocolate bread pudding, made with brioche over a vanilla cream and topped with slated caramel glaze and fresh berries. I could have ordered 3 more of these, they were so damn good.   Our waiter, John, made our meal even more excellent with his amazing personality, jokes, and attentiveness to our table. Thanks for a  great experience and cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Four of us had a wonderful dinner this past week in this neighborhood restaurant. Our waiter, Rex, was a real gem in terms of helping us make great culinary decisions: braised short ribs, scallops, scrumptious red cabbage with prickly pear (scrumptious!), risotto, midnight mojito, bread puddings, mussels, and dark chocolate creme brulee, Unfortunately, we don't live in Phoenix, but, when we return, we'll be sure to make a return trip to Rusconi's."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here to celebrate my birthday.   He made reservations for 5:30pm on a Sunday night.   It wasn't crowded, but was getting there by the time we left at 7:00pm  Is it wrong start with dessert? The Chocolate Bread Pudding is to-die-for!  A must.  But I digress...  Rusconi's is a large restaurant that feels cozy.   The staff is friendly, attentive, and courteous.     We started our meal with the Shrimp Crab Cakes.   Really it was ONE cake.   But I wish it were two -- it was that good.  My husband ordered the burger, my son the Salmon, and me the Roasted Chicken Salad.   All had excellent portion size and all very satisfying."}
{"text":"Very nice place to enjoy dinner and a conversation. It is a bit pricey however very nice small romantic feel. Mac and cheese was very goo and came in a cute cast iron dish. They also had very good drinks. Had a nice evening with my mom and sister."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Our meal was amazing from start to finish! Truffle mac and cheese is a must. It was difficult to decide what to order because everything sounded so good. I will definitely be returning to Rusconis!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the vicinity. I've been often for happy hour, a couple times for dinner and today for the first time to brunch.   Stuffed berry French toast and an eggs Benedict were just right to share. A little savory and a little bit of sweet.   Service can sometimes be a little wonky, but the proximity makes up for it.  A neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with another couple had dinner here this past Saturday night - a truly outstanding dining experience!  Charming cozy and upscale ambiance, very attentive staff and server, and exceptional food.  My husband and I had the salmon with a black berry glaze - delicious!  We ordered a cheese board as an appetizer - wonderful selection of cheeses plus berries and toasted pecans.  Their desserts were really great, too.  We had what I would describe as a peach/caramel/flan type of thing - delicious and not overly sweet.  My friend had chocolate bread pudding - another hit.  So glad this is in our neighborhood - great to have a restaurant of this caliber in our area.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ate there 2 months ago, and hadn't started writing reviews yet. I had to write something because I really enjoyed this place. I don't remember the last time I had enjoyed a meal and the complete experience so much. The service was impeccable! Our waiter was friendly and funny! I never lifted a finger to refill my wine glass or water.  I had the scallops and beefsteak tomato salad. The tomato in the salad was ripened to absolute taste perfection. I'm not sure what was on the very top of the salad, (small watermelon sized scoop of  something) but it brought out the flavor of everything, amazingly. The scallops were very enjoyable with the cauliflower puree. Magnifique! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, but can only give 4 stars due to the the lack of service we received from John (our server). Will come again.  Hope that the service is better."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! We had the special appetizer, which was bleu cheese stuffed and bacon wrapped figs, the beef medallions and another special, the pork osso buco. Every dish was fantastic. The beef medallions came with truffle mac and cheese that was worth a diary entry on it's own.  The only thing I didn't love was the wine selection. I had the only Zinfandel by the glass, sledgehammer and think there are much better choices to put on the menu in the same price range.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for dinner for my birthday last night. What a fabulous experience. The food was superb. The blending of flavors was incredible. Some of the best I've had. We're from New York City and have been to some top restaurants. This food was on a par with the best of them. Service was excellent, too. Our waiter, John, could not have been better. Prices are moderate, if not a bargain, considering the quality of the food. The owner is very visible and oversees every dish before it heads to the table. His attention to detail is very evident and appreciated. We will definitely be back and will be recommending it to all our friends."}
{"text":"My college age son and I visited Phoenix during his spring break to take in some spring training games. During our stay we had Sunday brunch and a weekday dinner at the excellent Rusconi's American Kitchen. The food is absolutely delicious.  I believe my statement as I ate was, \"this is to die for.\" The decor and ambiance are inviting and warm. Chef Michael puts his heart, soul and culinary genius into every scrumptious dish. The staff is professional and attentive. Whether you live in the greater Phoenix area or are just visiting, this restaurant is well worth the trip to Shea and Tatum. Just writing this review is making my mouth water."}
{"text":"Great food and very reasonably priced. Service was excellent at lunch. The BLT with short rib was fantastic!  Definitely worth the trip. Tried 3 other sandwiches and they were all very good too."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and service. The truffle mac n' cheese and the truffle fries were great. We also had the burger and short ribs, which were average. We'd probably eat here again."}
{"text":"How can anyone not give Rusconi a five star rating? Convenient parking, located in a strip mall helps. Once you step foot inside, you forget about the strip mall location, you are transported to a food delight universe. The hostess has the greatest smile to greet you, like she is happy to see you. Even though we had a reservation, and maybe because we were early, we decided to go to the bar and stayed there for dinner. Our experience started with the charcuterie and cheese board, and a half bottle of champagne. The recommended filet mignon entree and the lamb duo were to die for, and dessert was divine. The service was top, not intrusive, personable, friendly, knowledgeable. The wine list is ecclectic, something for everyone, and well priced. In short, Rusconi got 2 new fans that night. The GM stopped by, what a nice guy. Bravo Rusconi, and congratulations for the well deserved success."}
{"text":"We dined at this restaurant for the first time last night and it was truly a culinary delight. Nothing leaves the kitchen without final inspection from chef/owner Mike Rusconi. We were a party of four and every meal was a delight. We sampled the beef tenderloin medallions, roasted loin of lamb, and blackberry glazed salmon. Presentation was exquisite, attention to detail flawless and food scrumptious.  Our waiter Rex was a joy. He strongly recommended the chocolate bread pudding and it surely did not disappoint...a chocolate lovers nirvana. The restaurant is located in a shopping center and unassuming from the exterior but what awaits inside is true class. Very nicely appointed decor with an open kitchen. The four of us already have a reservation to return for a birthday celebration next week."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Chef is very creative and  his wife runs the front of the house with precision. I would  recommend  reservations. This is a gem in a very competitive restaurant area of Scottsdale/Paradise Valley. Prices are good for the quality and quantity of menu items. I had a chicken dish and my wife had steak. Both are complete meals,               not everything alacart like you see at restaurants that are not as good as this restaurant. Everything from appetizers, meals to the dessert was wonderful. Also high praise to bar with craft cocktails and a good wine menu. Don't be put off by front of location, beautiful inside. Try it out, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Solid! We had dinner on a sunday evening there.  It wasn't crazy busy but a good flow of traffic.  I was very skeptical b/c the previous yelp reviews weren't consistent. We had 6 people and each of our dishes came out absolutely fantastic.  I feel confident saying I know food and good food. I'm allergic to one thing and that's bad food.  The buffalo entree was juicy, done medium rare as requested (a simple request that so many restaurants simply don't follow well), Paella was moist and hearty, shortrib was fall-off-the-bone tender, Scallop was done to perfection.  Mussels appetizer is a MUST!  Chef came to the table at the end to check on us.  A nice touch that I hope he continues as this place gets more busy.  And I don't see why it won't. Definitely will go back!  I want to give it 5 stars but the wait staff needs just a little fine tuning.  They were very nice and enthusiastic but were very forgetful of alot of small requests like pepper and bringing the drink menus.  Minor but for a local place, customer service is paramount along with good food.  4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Have been there 3 times now.  Love the vibe inside with cool artwork.  In terms of the food, the pork belly appetizer is rich and wonderful and not to be missed.  Try the roasted chicken with green chili macaroni and roasted carrots- it was a pleasant, tasty surprise!.  Other standbys are the scallops, the truffled macaroni, and for dessert, the empanadas or the chocolate creme brûlée.  I love finally having a real neighborhood restaurant that is really good and not a chain!!"}
{"text":"Rusconi's is a terrific restaurant, one I'd gladly frequent if it were not so far from my house. I've been here twice now, once for friend's birthday dinner and again last night for dinner with the boyfriend. Both times the meals were delicious. I've tried the bison and beef tenderloins. The truffle mac and cheese is delicious.  Great service (except for the seating/hostesses, which left something to be desired). I defintely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was/is fantastic. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday on the fourth of July weekend and they treated us great. I was in regular contact with the GM and he helped me set up her surprise at the restaurant. I brought a cake in and they jazzed it up for me and made this day special for us. Did I mention the food yet? Delicious! The ambiance was perfect and the staff was outstanding. I definitely recommend this place. (I actually started a yelp account just to share my satisfaction about this place.)"}
{"text":"Excellent! Great variety to choose from. Wonderful presentation.  Knowledgeable waitstaff with helpful recommendations on combination of first & second courses and wine to go with both. Perfect! Delicious everything!"}
{"text":"GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD PLACE!!!  Excellent food, well prepared, varied menu, lots of things to choose from. Very helpful staff. Reasonable prices.  We've eaten there a number of times, it's always GREAT!.  If you want something simple try the Kitchen Hamburger,  ground beef,  goat cheese, caramelized onion, lettuce, and tomato. It will blow your socks off.  Chocolate bread pudding is a great way to end your meal.  You can always see what's cooking with their open kitchen, and you can even chat with chef/owner Michael Rusconi."}
{"text":"I have to say this did not disappoint.  Both out of town buddy and I were very impressed by the service, the presentation and the taste.  I had the salmon that was pretty darn good. But when you ask if the salmon is wild and the server says uhh, well it's sustainable.  Yeah. That means farmed. I don't care if it's from Scotland, it's farmed , and at this time of year get fresh northwest or Alaskan salmon from the pacific.  Wild. I get it at Fry's .  I would certainly recommend to others.  Not very busy but food  out quickly and hot.  Give it a try if you're in Scottsdale     I will be back for sure. Again staff was great and attentive.  If you want to walk out stuffed go to a dump like red lobster. Support local restaurants   My bro said his salad and scallops were great  so really I would make it a 4.5 if I could"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars My wife and I had a chance lunch over the holidays.  Limited menu with superb fare.   Sweet potato corn bisque, overtly sweet.  House salad was a wonderful change from  the norm, where the salad was enhanced with pine nuts, thinly sliced Italian hard cheese,  and wonderful sherry vinaigrette.  The short rib sandwich was wonderful with the flavors of the ribs being balanced with the arugula.  The waiter was knowledgable about the wines and  we enjoyed a nice Pinot Gris, (Willakenzie) and a very nice Pinot Noir (Laetitia Arroyo Grande)"}
{"text":"Wouldn't have guessed from the look of this place how great it is ! Looks small and commercial from the outside but it's the total opposite ! Darling restaurant ! Amazing friendly staff ( Dave the bartender is awesome ! ) food is amazaballs ! Modern Italian and American theres something for everyone and the desserts rock !  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Love our first visit to Rusconi's. Food is awesome and the service is outstanding . Ask for Rex!! Definitely  coming back!!! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and our food was delicious, I had the buffalo steak and it was prepared to perfection the atmosphere inside was wonderful once you get past the 'strip mall' entrance"}
{"text":"An average place.  Lively atmosphere and eager service.  The food is what falls short here.  Odd presentations with quality just above Applebee's. Surprised by all the high ratings. No spice. No brightness. No originality. It seems to be busy though, so good for them. Just not my taste. We won't be back."}
{"text":"AHMAZING (yes with an H). This place was recommended to us by our Uber driver.  The food was fantastic - Mac and Cheese, green chili grits, brie cheescake, short ribs of beef. Oh my, my. The service was great. You must try this place."}
{"text":"Babe and I went Sunday nite. Hannah is a great server.  She was atentative but not overbearing.  We each had the short ribs with speatzel.  What a great dish. The flavor is special. The salad was perfect with the burrata. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food at Rusconi's is OUTSTANDING! One of my favorite places to go when I get a chance to eat out. The place is a little on the smaller side so sometimes getting a seat can be a challenge, but is worth the wait. I feel so blessed that Michael choose my neighborhood to open his restaurant."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night with our 2 young children and it was a night to remember. From attentive staff to the chef who himself brought out my daughters chicken strips and fries. I had the New York strip with Brussel sprouts and light as cloud mashed potatoes. My husband had the beef medallions with to die for Mac and cheese. My 3 year old didn't care for her chicken strips( were a bit overcooked) but loved the New York strip and Brussel sprouts. It was prepared perfectly! For dessert we split the chocolate bread pudding which was served warm, perfect after a delicious meal. On Sundays, certain bottles of wine are half off as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has pretty amazing food.  Everything I try has an interesting layer to it.  Plates are well constructed with balanced flavors.  Their menu changes seasonally, so some nice variety.  Try the specials.   They also have a nice brunch with $5 Mimosas or Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Great first experience at Rusconi's.  We sat on the patio and started with the goat cheese peach fondue along with inspired cocktails and a solid Pilsner. My 9 year old ordered the short ribs and loved them despite the fact I think he he thought he ordered BBQ ribs. Glad he tried something new and I appreciate they offer more than nuggets. Our entrees were really well timed and well crafted. Hospitality and service was great."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite places to go to.  This should be a 4.5 star in my book.  It's nothing fancy being situated in a strip mall but the food is consistently amazing - fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  I've been there on busy and slow days.  Doesn't matter if it was lunch or dinner.  The chef is always around and greeting his patrons.  Our waitress was great - attentive and sweet.  The only thing to note was that I spoke to an employee, whom I won't point out to get them in trouble since it's meant to be a constructive tip, is that don't fake wine knowledge.  I may not be a wine expert but definitely not a novice.  Will be there to check out brunch soon!  :)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals here. Almost everything was great. The place is super cute inside and is much bigger than it appears when you walk in.  We started with the mussels appetizer which blew me away. This is the first place that I have been to in Arizona that can actually make decent mussels and these weren't just decent - they were awesome! For the entrees we tried the lamb and the scallops. Both were great. The only comment I can make is that the lamb was out of this world, but the scallops were just \"solid.\" Also, the cream of mushroom soup was pretty bland so that is the only thing I would recommend skipping.   This is truly a great neighborhood place and I can't believe I waited so long to try it. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was excellent. Decor was very nice. An all around plus for me. A little pricey for lunch but the service was so good that I was okay with it. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is a very good fit if you want a great, intimate place for dinner with great food and service. Love the salmon, scallops, flat iron steak and mussel! The wine and bubbly selection is also quite various. Try their baked apple cocktail!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the strip mall appearance, this little restaurant is wonderful! I have been there a couple times now, the first time during restaurant week to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised. I do not like to give five stars unless a place really wows me, and this place did, mostly from the food and the service perspective. The service was fantastic, and the food was very, very good. You can tell a lot of love from Chef Michael Rusconi and his staff went into the food. Nice size portions, and lot's of flavor, and very well priced. I was expecting an expensive meal, and I was surprised at how affordable it was, great value for what you get.   Although the interior is nice, it deserves a structure with a lot more character besides a spot in a strip mall. But then again, the food and service is so good, you forget about the surroundings. This is now one of my favorite restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"The worst dinner ever Maybe worse than the last time we were there. Time to re evaluate the bf who keeps selecting this place. Never again for me Epic fail  Poor everything I will never set foot in the door again Embarrassing to take guests there But he knew of the fail of last visit.' Wasted time and money I never ate!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am writing this review is because I don't live here - otherwise I would hate to share this gem with ANYONE..But I love my fellow yelpers for sending us here.  Top to bottom, what an experience - I had the mussels - wow..started off with the foie gras...super excellent. Kid had beef medallions with the truffled mac & cheese - kept stabbing us when we tried to eat his food. Husband had shrimp & grits - the shrimp tasted superb.  Wait staff was awesome - we sat right by the prep area and the chef (owner?) came over to ask us how our meal was - and thanked us when we left.  On top of all that - we got a nice call thanking us this morning for coming.  What - clearly we are not in Philly...but I wish this place was, because we would have a standing reservation..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Rusconi's after reading all of the five star reviews! Took my friend here for a birthday lunch. We split a turkey panini and each had a side salad. The panini was awful, not nicely grilled and cheesy, but plain, cold and hardly any filling. The salad was just field mixed greens and a few pine nuts. The greens were wilted and the stems were brown. Not fresh. The Parmesan fries were soggy not crispy. Very over-priced.  Our waiter was great, that star is for him."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing Service, Amazing food and Amazing Atmosphere. Not only the food tasted good but they looked so good. Loved everything about this place. And the Bathroom was so clean."}
{"text":"One word \"Costco\" lamb chops! Oh also \"UNWILD\" salmon!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the shopping plaza across from Whole Foods by Tatum and Shea is a little gem called Rusconi's American Kitchen.  I happened up this place because after dropping the toddler off we were desperate for a decent meal and some adult time.  I had never heard of this restaurant before and I drive by there often but I saw it had good reviews on Yelp and it was right during their happy hour time.  My husband and I were thrilled with the food we had, the prices were great and the service was attentive.  To start off our journey we ordered the American goat cheese and artichoke fondue with wood grilled flatbread.  Talk about creamy goodness that you can't stop eating, this is it.  You want to order this when you stop by, it warms you up and comforts your soul.  Then we tried out the slow roasted pork belly and shreiners sausage with poblano glaze, creamy polenta and grilled apple relish.  I am such a big fan of pork belly, I couldn't resist, the pork belly was crispy and popped with flavor.  Sharing the boneless beef short rib sliders with horseradish cream and smoke gouda, was hard because they're just that good.  Can I also say that I love their french fries!  I went back there for lunch not too long ago and enjoyed their roasted beef tenderloin with baby greens, fingerling potatoes, olives, green beans and onions.  So vibrant with color and taste.  I'll tell you what I tell all my friends, try it out!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Rusconi's. Always good service. Always an excellent meal. It is, hands down, one of the best restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed on this return visit. Service was not very attentive. Bread was stale. Salmon was not cooked as requested(overdone)and had to be returned. However, mussels were good and the dark chocolate bread pudding was excellent."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Rusconi's! We were excited to see a new local place opening in our neighborhood. We are now there at least once a week and my husband goes for happy hour 2-3 times per week. We normally sit at the bar, watch sports, and chat. The drinks are great and Dave and Zack treat us phenomenal! We have only sat in the dining room once but had a great experience there as well. We like it so much we have brought many of our friends in.  The food is Amazing!! I absolutely LOVE the veggie flatbread and order it almost every time I go. I even add the sausage sometimes.  The great thing about it is that it always seems different but tastes great. I love that it is grilled.  A+ flatbread  The Mac & Cheese is out of this world. So delicious! You can't go wrong here.  The Pork Belly is one of my husband's personal favorites as well. So much flavor packed into this dish.  We have had many other dishes that have all been tasty and can't wait to try more. We have really enjoyed Rusconi's thus far and look forward to having dinner and hanging out there more."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem tucked away in a shopping center.  I've been here for dinner twice, and lunch about 3 times.  I love it.  Service is always great.  Food is terrific and the price is reasonable.  On my first night dining here, the waiter got my order wrong (salmon instead of lamb...he even brought out the steak knife to cut the lamb).  It wasn't a big deal, and I ate/enjoyed the salmon anyway.  Regardless, he comp'd me for the dish and also gave us dessert.  Class act.  That gesture also brought me back several times after that.  I would definitely recommend....I just wish they were in a better location."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. The hype is real. Service was extremely attentive and friendly. All four entrees were out of this world (osso bucco, blackberry glaze salmon, scallops, and lamb/lamb stew). The whole menu looked appealing. A perfect meal. Don't be scared off by the unimpressive exterior."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. North Phoenix is riddled with lots of good restaurants but very few excellent ones and in my mind this is the best in the area and one of the best in town.  Truffled Mac and Cheese is amazing and i am not a Mac and Cheese person.  Short ribs, scallops snd salmon are all great.  Chocolate bread pudding for desert is s must.  Service has always been good but Fritz was exceptionally good.  Personable and great service   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food.  The service is excellent as well.  The atmosphere is very comfortable.  You won't be disappointed in anything here.  I particularly enjoy the happy hour which includes half price glasses of wine and a food menu with many delicious items on it for a very reasonable price.  Our bartender has been Toban the past few times we were there.  He provides very friendly professional service.  As much as I don't want it to get any more crowded you are missing out if you don't check this place out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me there for dinner...you couldnt tell it was a resturant from the outside,but open the door and it was very inviting. nice environment. very pleasing.. service was great and the food was wonderful...it is now my favorite place to enjoy a nice evening. I am glad that my girlfriend wanted me to try it...you will be pleased"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hype. Service was good, but the food was nothing special. Maybe we will try happy hour..."}
{"text":"Greed isn't pretty, but it's reality for this restaurant. We made an open table reservation for Valentines day.  One of us can't have any sugar, and also prefers a nice fish selection whenever possible. We thought this would be an easy place to meet our preferences.   Well these guys decided that guests dining on this day can ONLY order their $59 per person prix fix meal, with few entree choices and a dessert included for each person. None of this was noted at the time of the reservation. They basically took their regular pricing for a small appetizer, entree, and dessert and bundled it all together as a mandatory packaged deal, but then RAISED the price compared to regular menu prices.   So not only do you need to order/purchase more food than you want, with a limited selection (1 fish choice), but you have to pay extra for the pleasure of dining there.  Rude!  Why not offer the special holiday menu as an extra option for those who prefer prix fix, and not as the only menu available to order from??  Greed, that's why?!  You gouged me, so I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Second time.  Food is innovative and  service  (Tom) is attentive and caring.  Must try.  I understand they have a great happy hour too can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This place has the best service!! My girlfriend and I ate dinner here and I could see someone walking around talking to tables.. it wasn't a server and when he came to my table I asked who he was. It was the owner!! So sick to see someone owning something, still working in the establishment. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Would you imagine a great restaurant could sit in a strip mall next to a pizza joint and a chain greek restaurant?  Believe it!    Rusconi's is a true gem. I had the sirloin tips while my girlfriend had the salmon.  Now these aren't your ordinary dishes: for example, my sirloin tips sat on a delicious bed of truffle scented mac and cheese.    I also liked that they don't serve over-sized huge portions.  The portions are just big enough so you have room for...wait for it.....the chocolate bread pudding.   The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was very funny, offered great suggestions, and always on point to fill our water and wine glasses.  We'll be back - but please don't sell out of the chocolate bread pudding.  I need more!!"}
{"text":"Our experience at this restaurant was spectacular. We were impressed with the service and the meal. Waiter was fun and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went there for New Year's Eve and everything we had was delicious and our server was friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood spot. Equally enjoyable for happy hour or a special dinner to enjoy with out of town friends or relatives. Filet, chicken, salmon, scallops--how do they get the best seafood in the Valley? But save room for dessert. Always a winner.  And if you are lucky enough to get Brian as your server, you'll be coming back frequently."}
{"text":"Like this great little restaurant. Good food with nice presentation. Shocking it's in a strip mall location ... But it is pricey real estate! Something for everyone. Well done."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Place filled up early but our waiter remained attentive. Lots of delicious menu items that you don't find elsewhere. Tiny little bar but has great happy hour."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had the roast salmon.  It was so good.  Best I've ever had.  My wife ordered the scallops.  They were even better, though I wouldn't have believed that was possible had she not shared a little with me.  The service was very attentive.  The best thing was how thoughtful and fun our waiter was.  Our 9 year old doesn't always feel comfortable in a \"grownup's restaurant,\" but our waiter engaged so thoughtfully and nicely with her that she had a fantastic time.  Our other two were also struck, saying afterward that \"the waiter was just so nice!\"  The owner came by the table and introduced himself as well.  He made the children feel welcome and thought of.  He told our youngest that if she didn't find what she wanted on the desert menu, they would make anything they had the ingredients for.  Back to the food.  The desserts were great.  My wife got the chocolate bread pudding.  I got the, Hm..., carmel and fruit covered pudding.  It was all delicious.  You wanted to just close your eyes and enjoy how good it was.  (Actually, I did.)"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like Rusconi's. The chef/owner is makes an effort to greet customers. The same can't be said, however, about some of his staff. My husband and I tried the restaurant on several occasions. We want a non-chain restaurant to succeed in this location. We've experienced lapses in service and the food has been unmemorable. A particular visit particularly stands out. We brought our family to Rusconi's for lunch. The bartender acted very disinterested. We sat for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks. When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole. The posole resembled dirty dishwater. There was literally one piece of posole floating in the broth. When we asked our waiter to split the checks, he sighed and said it was a \"big deal\" for him to do so. Needless to say, we won't be back nor will any members of our party."}
{"text":"We went for their Easter brunch, which was our third visit here. All 3 of our dining experiences were fantastic. The food is beautifully prepared and service is friendly. Colin, our server on Easter brunch, created a great experience, and it is the first time in a long time I have seen my Dad devour his meal and love every bite. Their happy hour menu looks great so can't wait to try that. A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great good, good service , and redemption at its finest.....I'll explain.  So my wife and I wanted to out for a nice dinner.  So we made a reservation for 4 at 8:00 on Saturday night and met up with her sister and husband.  We arrived 5 minutes before 8, and I can tell they were busy cause the place will packed and there were several couples waiting in front of us.  We were told they are running a little behind and its going to be a few minutes, well we didn't want to make a big scene, but that's the purpose why we made a reservation, is so we don't have to wait so long.  Finally at 8:25 we were seated at our table.  From that point on the service and food was outstanding.  Our waiter was very personable and did a great job.  We ordered the shrimp with risotto for our appetizer and I ordered the \"kitchen burger\" medium rare and my wife ordered the mussels.  Both dishes were cooked very well and we really enjoyed them.  My brother in law and his wife ordered the same thing.  As we finished our meals, the head chef came over and apologized for the long delay at the beginning and offered us complimentary dessert on them.  It was a very kind gesture  and since my wife is pregnant she really appreciated it.  They offered up 4 desserts for the table to share. We thought all of them were great, but the bread pudding really stood out.  Overall, it started out with a little hiccup, but the staff really shined though and made the dinner experience wonderful.  My brother in law and wife are regulars at this place, and I would definitely  be back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"The best cholocate bread pudding and glazed salmon I have ever had.   The bread pudding almost tastes like a brownie.  The glazed salmon was cooked perfectly with fingerling potatoes and well prepared Brussels spreouts.   It's all about the great chefs that completely care about the food and dining experience.   Great service and food recommendations. Only criticism is that not every dinner menu item is available for lunch.  My wife would have liked to try the lamb chops that had rave reviews."}
{"text":"It was very nice! The food was spectacular and the service was good I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The kitchen burger was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The lamb chops were amazing and the artichoke fondue was creamy and delicious. most interesting after i return next weak waiter remember me and my preferences"}
{"text":"Oh good golly. Is there no good food in the Phoenix area? Maybe I've been spoiled by the spoils of riches in Chicago. Our server at Rusconi's was spectacular but the food was bland. The risotto side dish had no salt and no flavor, same for the grits with shrimp. Fortunately I had some amazing grits at Yardbird in Las Vegas a day later so my faith in grits has been restored."}
{"text":"Finally found our little foodie spot!!!  Love the atmosphere.  The food was great and the carmel chocolate desert in the jar was so good we ordered another.  The staff was friendly and knowledgable and service was great.  You can tell it's managed well by how efficient the staff is at doing there job from hosting to bussing to serving it was all on point!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix on business, I had a few hours before my flight home and wanted to find a great place for lunch. After reading the reviews on Yelp and TA, Rosconi's, it was!   Rosconi's did NOT disappoint! First, it can never be understated just how much good customer service impacts your dining experience. The hostess was pleasant when she greeted me and my server was nothing short of fantastic. She knew how to read her tables and provided just the right amount of attention to each. I never had my iced tea empty nor did I have to respond to incessant \"how is everything\" with a mouth full of delicious food. She was amazing.  Now let's discuss the menu. There were so many delectable items, it was quite a task to decide. I opted for the White Truffle Mac N Cheese as an appetizer and the Blackberry Glazed Salmon for my entree. The presentation of the Mac N Cheese was just adorable, but that was nothing compared to the wonderful moment I ate my first bite. Truly delicious beyond words. I can still taste it and this was two days ago. The Salmon was cooked perfectly at medium and blackberry glaze was an unexpected delight.   I ended the meal with the Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding coupled with a cappuccino. The moist dark chocolate bread pudding was perfectly topped with white chocolate chunks and was surrounded in a white chocolate sauce. I can honestly say that this will go down as one of my absolutely favorite desserts.  All in all, I will always make sure to visit Rosconi's when traveling to Az. Truth be told, I may travel to Phoenix just to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the place. Brought our toddler and they were so accommodating. The blue cheese fritz salad was a fabulous surprise. The salmon and scallops were cooked perfectly and the creative preparations were delicious. The servers were fantastic as well. The wine menu was well selected and we loved our Sonoma red blend. The dark chocolate bread pudding was perfectly delicious. Loved the place."}
{"text":"If you are a ' foodie', and / or appreciate a good wine list, this is your spot. I've been here maybe 8-10 times. Always a sure spot. This time, we ordered the PEI mussels to share. A disappointment, BUT it must be said in AZ they are a few days old, and dried up in our summer heat. Not much meat in each.  We alerted our waiter, and he swiftly removed them, taking them off our bill. We ordered the scallops w fennel salad ( OMG ! The fennel salad was killer ! ...off the charts delish). Perfectly seared scallops.  Totally yummy.  In the meantime - most importantly, three staff people / management came to our table insisting we order desert, on the house. We didn't, but : will soon return for the beautifully plated fare, with the outstanding wine list. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner. The food was fantastic the service was great. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"All wait staff was super friendly. Chef/owner even came over to chat with some fellow Chicago-ans. The salmon was phenomenal and the chocolate bread pudding was to die for. Highly recommend this restaurant. Love love love. Wish I lived in Arizona to be able to visit this place more often."}
{"text":"One of best dining experiences I've had in Phoenix.  Looking forward to my next time there."}
{"text":"I was surprised that such a well reviewed restaurant was so quiet on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year's. The salmon sliders were very tasty.  My husband was not so impressed with his Huevos rancheros nor did my daughter like her chicken tenders.   My other daughter did enjoy her pancakes though I wish it was served with a side of fruit or something.   Also service was a bit spotty though they were very nice. They did not bring the crayons for the children's menus that had activities that we had to request. My husband also never received his Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch today and everything was awesome!  We had The Kitchens Egg Benedict, Strawberry and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast, Boneless Beef Short Rib Sliders on Pretzel Buns, Roasted Beef Tenderloin with Baby Greens, Mimosas and Caramelized Glazed Pear Martini!  Everything was wonderful, very attentive & friendly staff, and great atmosphere!!!  This will def be a regular place for future brunches with family!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time, Thursday evening. A recommendation from a friend. There were 4 of us and we all loved what we ordered, beef tenderloin and salmon. Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious. Oh!! the macaroni and cheese is highly recommended. The beef melted in your mouth and tasty. The salmon was also cooked perfectly and delicious.  Kudos to the chef..... Fritz, is THE server. Wonderful evening and will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was marginal.  Silverware was not replaced and I sat staring at my food for a long time.  Forgotten drinks were brought from the bar with the ice melted instead of being remade.  There was plenty of staff but their execution wasn't very good it seemed like nothing but trainees.  The waiter went on and on with the most annoying jokes and doubled down with more after he picked up on how flat they fell.    Osso buco (great spelling check there....Yelp is changing it to \"pass buck\") was dried out.  Maybe over cooked but honestly it felt reheated....probably not but it was of different consistencies and just sucked.  The same comment was made by the other person that ordered it too.    No rave reviews from our group but the pricing seemed fair albeit a bit inconsistent that it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Still LOVE this place, the seasonal and ever changing menu challenges me to get something new instead of my stand-by favorites like Posole and Mac and cheese. Today, carrot ginger soup and quiche special were perfect I don't say perfect often.     Owners and staff always are attentive and paying attention to the details."}
{"text":"It's always nice when one of your favorite restaurants, that is just consistently outstanding, adds a little twist and makes things even better. While dining at Rusconi's the other night and sitting close to the kitchen and being waited on by one of their best, Brian, Chef recognized us as frequent visitors and sent over a trio of desserts. By the way I had their duck breast special and it was off the chart good. The desserts were small servings of peach ice cream, a root beer float chilled dessert, and a tangerine basil sorbet. The last was even better than the previous two with flavors of basil infused through the sorbet and not just a garnish on top. All were spectacular. Not that we needed any reason to come back but truly proves again why this is a local favorite!"}
{"text":"Have only been for lunch but this is a really good place.  Not many choices on the menu but I actually prefer that.  You can count on this place for great food and great service"}
{"text":"I'm beyond impressed! The Chef is talented and everything out of that kitchen is to \"die for\" What a great restaurant !"}
{"text":"Excellent Mother's Day menu included appertif, entré, and dessert for reasonable $49 price. Service was exceptional.   Creme Brule and Lemon Budino were the perfect ending w/fresh brewed coffee."}
{"text":"This restaurant really is improperly named.  The one reviewer that speaks about the food being sold out, does need to understand, this is a gourmet chef, using fresh products each day, and so this is not your standard fare, and when they are sold out, they really bend over backwards to accommodate you.  Chef Rusconi generally will come out to meet with the people. The first time I found this restaurant, it was because my friend told me she had found this wonderful restaurant I had to try.  What an understatement! We had the goat cheese and artichoke dip with soft pita bread, and braised ribs over a white truffle and mashed potato blend, with a golden brown gravy.  For dinner, one friend had the N.Y. Strip with the White truffle mac & cheese.  Another friend had the roasted Rack of Lamb.  I decided upon the scallops which were perfectly washed, not a bit of sand, and carmelized perfectly, plump and tender.  Not overcooked as so many restaurants do.  We have since gone many times, never disappointed.  You will not be either."}
{"text":"We went here for NYE dinner and I will be back very soon! I had the T bone....well seasoned, perfectly cooked, it was heaven. I also got mac and cheese as a side, yum! My starter was a warm goat cheese salad and can I just tell you how happy I was with those little goat cheese balls? So happy!  Yes, it's in a strip mall next to Panda. Such a random place for this little gem, but don't let that deter you. I can't wait to go back! Also, the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!.  Hands down, one of the best in Phoenix.  My favorite thing to order here is the Salmon dinner or the roasted chicken.  The ambiance is wonderful and always has a helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with my husband.  We had a great dining experience with our excellent waitress Shantia and amazing food.  Phenomenal meal and best chocolate bread pudding ever."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in many years and the service was terrific! Try the beignet's if they have them that day out of this world!"}
{"text":"place was on point.. seemed good for the quality of the product. I thought it was cheap compared to other restaurants on the same level. I got the beef medallions, it had Mac n Cheese. it also came with some veggies cooked to perfection with a great sauce all around."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the yelpers a friend and I had brunch here on a Sunday, when I realized it was in a strip mall I was a little surprised, but once I found the Restuarant it had all the ambiance of a 5 star Restuarant. So welcoming, beautiful, opened to the outside, ski lights, etc. who ever designed this place knew what they were doing. Neither of us were very hungry so we opted to split a crab and egg Benedict. I asked for the muffin to be replaced with spinach. It came with beautiful fingerling potatoes and was simply Devine.  The service, staff, entree, filtered watered, we were even asked if we wanted lemons. It was absolutely delightful. The Chef came out and thanked a party of 8 for coming out every Sunday. It has such a warm, and cheerful environment."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint!  The service is very good. Everyone I've sat with has been friendly and attentive.  I've been for happy hour and a few times for dinner on the weekend. The burgers and mac n cheese are awesome. Great cocktail mixing too. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, I would just add that food was a little bland for me."}
{"text":"One of the best restuarants I have been to in the area. It doesnt look like anything special from the outside being in a strip mall and between a panda express and another fast food place so im glad someone had recommended we go there. The service is exceptional and the food is very fresh. First time I had chicken and it was so good! We went back recently and I was disappointed t hear they were out of chicken but I ended up getting the grouper special and it was very good!  So glad we discovered this!"}
{"text":"We ordered a tasting of appies, cocktails, and dessert.  - mixed greens salad 4/5, very good but nothing special. - Truffle Mac and cheese 5/5, hands down the best Mac and cheese we have ever tasted!!! - short rib, was delicious and had a very unique vanilla flavor that I loved. Potatoes weren't great, but weren't bad either. - shrimp and grits, the grits and sauce were delicious. The shrimp tasted a little muddy, but that's coming from someone who lives on the ocean and has fresh seafood all the time. 4/5 - artichoke fondue, this was actually quite disappointing. It's an artichoke dip, not a fondue, it was served lukewarm Not worth the money. 2/5 - Girl Scout dessert, maybe the best dessert I have ever had(just my opinion). It is like taking a peanut butter and banana sandwich and making it into a caramel flavored sundae. My wife didn't think it was as good as I did, but I thought it was superb! 5/5"}
{"text":"Happy to be with My family and friends for a post thanksgiving meal.... Good bottle of Malbec some delicious apps and on to the main course. Everyone was satisfied with their meal my steak was deliciousour server was great and our table was perfect with eyes on the kitchen and the chef! Fun nite."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a nice surprise.  I'd been by this place numerous times, and it doesn't look like much from the outside (especially considering the two places it's sandwiched between).  But my wife and I were looking for something new to try, so we stopped in for dinner.  We noticed it was very busy on a random Tuesday evening - probably a good sign.  We also noticed everybody was genuinely friendly inside: the host, our waiter, the manager.... The decor was nice too.  And the food was outstanding.  I started with the butternut squash soup, which I usually am not a fan of but the server really sold it on us.  I was not disappointed at all - it was delicious.  Garnished with duck ravioli and full of flavor.  For my entree I had the scallops.  Again, lots of flavor, served over mashed potatoes and topped with fresh sprouts.  Delicious, and not overly filling either.  My wife really enjoyed her natural roasted chicken and wine.  With our entrees being so good, we took home some bread pudding for dessert.    Overall, very pleasantly surprised.  We'd intended to grab a quick bite, but this turned into an outstanding meal.  We will definitely return.  (And it takes a lot for me to give five stars!)...."}
{"text":"My sister and I had dinner last night at Rusconi's Kitchen and it was utterly fantastic.  I had the Osso buco and it was melt in your mouth perfect.  The dish was sublime and I will definitely be back.  The only thing I would say needs improvement is the hostess, she needs to learn how to smile."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have eaten here for lunch. The staff is always so friendly and helpful!! I usually get the salmon dish. It is amazing!! Next time I will have to try something different. The sandwiches l heard are really good too.  I will for sure keep coming back!"}
{"text":"excellent meal!!!  had the tenderloin and Mac and cheese... awesome.  Sunday night 1/2 price bottles!  love this place"}
{"text":"Man this place is fantastic. We have visited twice and both visits were exceptional. The reviews do not lie. Friend told me about this place and now I have added another restaurant to my list of local favs. Beef medallions were excellent ! Chicken was great, burger was great, drinks were great, basically everything we had was 4-5 stars. The dining room is small but they do a great job with the room they have and also have a patio which helps.   Our server was heather and she was fantastic. Chef Michael visited our table and recognized we were in a couple nights before and not only asked about our visit but also thanked us for our business. Keep up the good work we will be back very soon !"}
{"text":"We live close to Rusconi's and started dining there about three months ago based on a recommendation from a friend. We have been back three times in the last three months and have had an excellent experience each time. The food is delicious and we have always been pleased with the service. Don't let the strip mall turn you off...the inside of the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. I recommend stopping in for happy hour, as their beef tenderloin sliders are amazing (although you can't go wrong with anything on the menu). I'm so happy to live close to this terrific, local restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience for Happy Hour at Rusconi's! It was a bit of a drive for us but we headed over on Friday right after work. The restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived but it definitely picked up closer to the end of the Happy Hour time / beginning of dinner time.  We decided to try a few items out from their Happy Hour menu -- Goat Cheese & Grilled Peach Fondue, Short Rib Sliders, and the \"Kitchen Platter\". This was a lot of food for two people; we could've just ordered two items and been set!  The fondue was definitely our favorite, it had a unique taste with the goat cheese & sweetness from the grilled peach. My husband enjoyed the sliders, I'm not a huge fan of Short Rib so I didn't have more than a small bite. We did upgrade to the side of Truffle fries which we wouldn't do next time due to the price.  The \"Kitchen Platter\" was massive! It came with two different types of cheeses, three different types of meats, pickled carrots / cauliflower / sun-dried tomatoes, spiced olives, pesto, and bread. Overall, a really filling option with quality items. I wouldn't hesitate to get this again!  We ended up getting the Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding as well for dessert. It wasn't my favorite dessert ever due to the dark chocolate but it was pretty good. Their Brie Cheesecake sounded interesting so it's now on my list to try out next time!  Overall, a good choice of restaurant for Happy Hour! The service was good throughout the evening and they had decent sized menus for food and drinks. We'll stop by again!"}
{"text":"Tried it with my daughter last night...she has the paella...loved it...I had the osso Bucco...a little dry w/ a weird  candied cabbage side...be nice to have a little bread while waiting on entrees...service a little slow.....nice place....good lighting and temps...hope this place succeeds...we live very close....i suggest more meat and potato fare....not the Biltmore"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service will return again soon."}
{"text":"Food and service by the waiters and busboys was great,place was very clean, chefs cooked my food in a timely fashion,  and the dishwasher did a great job on providing me with clean plates and utinciles. The only thing that this place can inprove on is asking if they can take your plate and not just assuming that you are done eating. I still had a bit of food left on my plate and out of nowhere as i am on my phone i see a hand out of the corner of my eye that snatches my plate...   I had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin.  It was amazing but i do not recommend it if you are really hungry, it is a small dish. I am satisfied over all and will be returning:^)"}
{"text":"Arrived ahead of our reservation time but were seated immediately.  The service was terrific.  Got sat in the very back; not great, but attributing that to the luck of the draw.  Food was outstanding and the pace of the meal was on target!"}
{"text":"I attended my office Christmas party here, there were 8 people at the table. We were seated next to the kitchen. It was a bad decision by management and wait staff to sit large groups beside kitchen, as it is so noisy, can hardly hear across the table. Big groups should be seated away from kitchen, smaller groups of two or three are fine.  Food quality was great, for that alone I would give 4 stars or more.  But the review was about total experience. I would highly recommend larger groups to not sit beside the kitchen to have a very positive dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here for happy hour, which is always most enjoyable with fairly priced drinks and small bites. We finally made it for dinner and it was even better than we expected. My husband had the beef medallions and amish blue cheese potato salad, which he really enjoyed. I had one of the evening specials - the tomato and burrata salad. In the past, at other restaurants, when I have ordered this I am always disappointed by either the bland burrata or poor quality tomatoes. Not this time as both were excellent. I also had the garlic wilted spinach, which also was very good. We shared the Ricotta Beignets, which were so tasty.  The service provided by Meghan and the bus staff was exceptional. Chef Rusconi is highly visible and a truly \"hands-on chef\" which shows in his food. It was a very enjoyable evening and we will return. It is wonderful to see a \"non-chain\" restaurant in that area become so successful."}
{"text":"After having been introduced to Rusconi's several years ago, it had climbed to our #1 place to go.  The food is always very good and the service has been absolutely outstanding.  Which is why I'm disappointed enough to write this review.   Last week we selected Rusconi's as the place to meet some friends we hadn't seen in a year.  Shortly after being seated we got our drinks and menus.  And then, less than 5 minutes later, the waiter was back to get our order.  We told him we hadn't even looked at the menu and asked that he come back in a couple minutes.  I reckon he was there in less than two.  The orders were placed and delivered quickly.  The food was great and we added a dessert.   The check followed within minutes and as we sat, finishing drinks, about one hour and 20 minutes after sitting down, the Chef and owner came to our table.  While he thanked us for coming, it was apparent to all of us that his real point of contact was to let us know it was time to leave, then said he had to get back to the kitchen.  It was only our table he visited.  The adjacent tables had been seated a bit after ours.  Perhaps he stopped by theirs a little later.   It was a hurried dinner, not a relaxing dining experience"}
{"text":"My Happy Hour buddy and I have gone here several times to sample all the little morsels they had to offer: from the pork belly in grits, mussels soaked in a savory broth to a healthy crisp sweet beet and smooth goat cheese salad.   I've also had the open face ravioli which was filled with a veggie type compote with pasta  laid on topped with a nice light sauce.  My buddy's  scallops had a slight crisp outside and tender inside.  I tried moonshine for the first time and it did had a nice kick. but was not overpowering.   We will definitely return to try the other delish dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"There is some serious talent taking place at this restaurant.   I found this place on yelp when I was looking to find a new restaurant experience. For me this place lived up to the reviews and more.   The chef is outstanding and the food quality is  divine. I am always over joyed to see a small business owner putting their personal passion into their work.  The quality surpasses most chain restaurants and corporate menus.  I am excited to return! I will recommend to others!"}
{"text":"3 Sundays in a row to this gem hidden on Tatum and Shea by the Albertsons. Excellent service and food with great smoked meats and rich developed flavors. Some serious kitchen skills and love for the food, throw in a very good 5$ bloody mary and the line should be out the door. We have now had almost half of the brunch menu and everything is spot on, as a chef I can appreciate the extra time and attention to detail on the smallest of things. Add top notch professional servers, Sean the bartender and a real manager touching tables and ensuring the meal meets expectations places this on the top of my list for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Visiting from Austin, noticed the yelp reviews and decided to try.  Absolutely worth the effort.  Crowd is older, and the place looks to stay really busy despite the location, which is centered in a retail strip between other eateries.  There is a constant buzz of happy diners, and the execution of the various plates presentations only reinforces ones confidence that the meal has been prepared with the utmost attention to detail.  If you haven't been here, you should, and if you have, then you already know."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  We sat at the bar and the service and food were both spectacular.  The short rib appetizer was so flavorful and tender- the best I've ever had.  The salmon was perfection!  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the portion sizes are a little on the small side... Our plates were licked clean and I would've loved a bite or two to take home.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We visited Rusconi's for a family birthday. The entire meal was executed phenomenally. We had the cheese board with meats and cheese. Every sampling was wonderful.  The cauliflower soup was delicious. I had the salmon over fingerling potatoes and Brussel sprouts. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone I meet.  It was wonderful and I fully plan on frequenting it often."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food. Had the cream of cauliflower soup and salmon with fingerling potatoes and husband had the caesar salad and chicken w/ green chilli mac. All delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Started off with an old fashion which was ok at best but that did not deter me from enjoying my night. John G was our severer and you could tell he loved his profession which made our night great. Talked me into the beef medallions and scallop combination which steak first try was not med rare but more med plus side. Manager was there within 4 bites and, without question, rectified my situation quickly, second steaks (new dish by the way) were beyond perfect. They handled themselves very well and the personality of the staff and ambiance will bring me back for sure. Had a fantastic date night with my wife and will recommend this place to many people, good job and thank you"}
{"text":"I LOVED IT. Went for big anniversary dinner and had chef's tasting menu with wine pairings... mmmmm... chocolate bread pudding. Scallops. OMG, the arugula shrimp salad. AND the osso bucco was perfect! Excellent server, too... (Thanks, Hannah!)"}
{"text":"At first we had a hard time looking for the restaurant due to being next to panda express, kind of odd for such a high quality place to be located in the plaza, however, In love with this place!   First time diner and definitely blown away by the food and amazing service by Hannah. My boyfriend and I ordered the short rib sliders and fondue appetizer for happy hour and a few drinks. I got the Lamb entree and my boyfriend got the sirloin done at medium rare, absolutely melted in my mouth.  They have amazing wine deals on monday and sunday nights, half off on bottles! Of course we had to get a bottle of Cabernet to finish the night off. Tom, one of the managers at the restaurant was very friendly and introduced himself to us, making sure we were enjoying everything throughout our dinner service. We're planning on making this place one of our regulars.  Michael Rusconi opened up this restaurant in 2012, I give him kudos!"}
{"text":"A perfect combination of family owned and locally grown. Dirt cheap, upscale food all prepped in house.  The restaurant looks great but I have not made it passed the bar. The chef/owner Michael Rusconi has delivered my food on many occasions! A real gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been to Rusconi's twice now since moving to the Phoenix area in August 2015.  The meals have been delicious and the service fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the night after valentines day. The dinner was delicious...I even ate the Brussels spouts. Tommy was our server and he was awesome. He recommended some cocktails which we loved- do the Baked Apple. The bartender told me about it and it was sooooo good. Every course was excellent and the service was outstanding. Highly recommended for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Food here was great. I sampled several of the appetizers, including the pork belly, short rib, and kitchen board. My main course was the roasted sea scallops  Unfortunately, the meal was well over two hours, with the dinner arriving at around the 90 min mark. The service was great and staff was friendly  Worth it if you have the time..."}
{"text":"Everything is so good! It wasn't too loud and too dark. Happy hour, drinks under $10.  The services was really friendly and nice. My burger was like biting into a cloud."}
{"text":"Despite getting a chilly letter of rejection after I applied there , I went to lunch at Rusconi's American Kitchen anyway. So they lacked finesse in the hiring process, but the food and service was great. Brian was our server. He recommended the salmon with blackberry glaze. Delicious! My grandmother had the tossed roasted chicken salad, it her favorite. My aunt had the short rib sandwich. I wanted to rip it out of her hands. She didnt offer me a bit but it looked damn good. We finished with a dark chocolate bread pudding. Nice twist to the usual \"old person dessert\". We also had the creme brulee. The service was seamless. The water and wine was always flowing, the plates were cleared in a timely and silent matter. Great job Brian and Rusconi's American Kitchen ."}
{"text":"There is a new restaurant in town and it is AMAZING!  We went for a quick, casual mid-week dinner and couldn't have been more pleased.  Both Lon's and T. Cooks top our list of favorite restaurants so we were excited to see what Chef Michael was offering in his own place.  My salmon was phenomenal and my husband's braised beef was tender and excellent.  Chef Michael even came out of the kitchen to talk to my four year old and find out what she wanted to eat, offering her whatever he could make.  In addition, when we asked if they had a piece of paper so she could draw, instead of bringing a blank piece of printer paper, they downloaded and printed a coloring page. It was so unexpected and thoughtful.  That is just an inkling of the level of service we received.  We will definitely be going back regularly."}
{"text":"In from out of town and stumbled upon this place for lunch.  Food was so good we may come back for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner last night.  Upon arrival, we were to be seated in the first table for two by the door (Open Table reservation).  Refusing that undesirable location, the manager advised us that he could provide a different location in five to ten minutes.  Five minutes by the clock, we were shown to a private table in the rear of the restaurant.   Service was attentive and solicitous all evening.  Hard to imagine some Yelpers being put off by the \"intrusive\" service.  Our waiter was happy (imagine that) and did a most professional job.  The risotto with duck and sherry jus was excellent, and disappeared quickly.  My wife had the filet medallions, perfectly prepared; only complaint the size of the entrée.  No such issue with my Pork Osso Buco.  Succulent meat served with delicious pricky pear braised cabbage and garlic herbed spaetzle.  Extremely large portion.  Large and representative wine list, in price order.  The restaurant is loud, if you desire a quiet dinner, this is not the place.  But if you want excellent food, at a more than fair price point, attentive service, and a lively atmosphere, you'll be more than satisfied, I'm sure."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and it was just as amazing as the first. I was about 20 minutes early for my reservation and they were able to seat me right away. The menu changed from my last visit (maybe due to change in season) but the beef medallions were absolutely fantastic. I know it's next to a Panda Express but don't let that fool you, it is a really nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find in Phoenix!  Awesome variety of the menu of new American classics!  Had the porcini mushroom soup with creme foam and black shaven truffles- yum!  Candy striped beet salad looked awesome.  Had the guajillo braised duck over foie gras and a pumpkin pancake - sooooo yummy! Hubby had the roasted chicken with the green chile Mac and cheese - sooo good!   They also had so many tantalizing dishes such as shrimp and grits, truffle oil Mac and cheese, wonderful salads, cheese platters and appetizers that you can do tapa's style and share!  We went on Sunday, wine bottles are half off - SCORE!!  Great wine selection, another plus, great friendly attentive service, another plus.....dessert, chocolate mousse with salted caramel drizzle!!   Back to the gym after this place!!   Great restaurant, will be back"}
{"text":"Simply amazing . A little over priced on a couple of things but worth it when the entire meal is delicious . Took the dessert to go so we will see how that goes . I would recommend it for sure !! (:"}
{"text":"We decided to give Rusconi's another try one Saturday night. I am back to loving this place. Hostess, polite. Waiter, awesome. Food, to die for. We sat on the patio. I had the beef tenderloin and mac and cheese and it was amazing. However, the chocolate bread pudding is possibly one of the best desserts I have ever had. I don't even like bread pudding. But whatever they do to this mixes the perfect texture and just enough chocolate taste to be heavenly. Make a reservatuon and give this place a try, it is great!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for two at Rusconi's on a Wednesday night. It is a nice buildout in a strip mall. The bar was packed and everone was having a good time. It's not a big draft list but the wine list is great. I had the filet medallions and my wife had the sustainable salmon. Both entres were seasoned well and the garnish complimented the proteins. Our biggest issue was that everthing was cold except for the salmon. It was obvious that the plates died at the pass waiting for the salmon. The manager bought us some ice cream for our troubles. My guess is that the execution is usually better than our experience. Don't pay for the ice cream. It is low quality ice milk. We might try again someday."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood restaurant! Doesn't matter what you order, it's all fantastic food. They also serve several different varieties of eggs Benedict on Sundays, Yum!"}
{"text":"This was the one meal of the trip that I made reservations for as I knew I wanted to try this place out.  Everything about Rusconi was great from the food to the service to the price making it our standout meal of this trip.    Since we had a late lunch we just went for entrees and the flavors and presentation was spot on.  Owner and Executive Chef Michael Rusconi was in full view and on hand finishing up the dishes to make sure everything is perfect and perfect they were.  I was so glad that I ate here on our first night as we came back a second time just two days later before leaving Arizona.    Roasted Scallops were served with a vanilla cauliflower puree as smooth as mashed potatoes and a shaved fennel, watercress, and green apple salad for a bit of citrusy crunch.    Apple glazed pork tenderloin with a warm garnet yam salad and green beans was solid but in comparison to our other dishes was probably my least favorite.  I would go with the beef tenderloin over this one.   Grilled squash and goat cheese bread pudding wilted spinach, carrot jus, and the seasonal asparagus just had an amazing wow factor that we had to get it a second time.    Grilled beef tenderloin medallions truffle scented mac n cheese, carrots, small green beans, and a red wine reduction was the dish we wanted to try that prompted us to come back a second time as the table next to us raved about the flavor combination of the tenderloin and the truffle mac and cheese.  Conclusion, I agree 100%.  It absolutely blew the center cut filet we had at Barking Frog the day before out of the water.    Our server Craig was absolutely wonderful, hard working and personable making sure we were well taken care of without being intrusive that it left a memorable impression on us.  Overall, service here is great in general as Rex took great care of us as well the second time since Craig was off.    Although Chef Rusconi was off on Monday, they have a great 1/2 off bottle promotion for any wines with glass offerings."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that deserves a better location!  But don't ever go too far away!  Best little Italian gem on n. Tatum."}
{"text":"I came here thinking I would just get a salad and decided to try the burger just because I wanted to upgrade the fries for $4 to their truffle essence fries, and I must say that their burger was worth the $14 price ($18 total). I'm a fan of the Habit and In-n-Out Burger, but their burger I found far superior in everything about it. I also like arugula and goat cheese, so if you like those and want a great burger try theirs. Their fries are fantastic! Go for the upgrade. Other people at my table ordered the lamb and said it was good and everyone said the soup are the best, but I haven't tried them, yet. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"It's so frustrating as a customer or diner at a restaurant when the food is so inconsistent.  We came here two weeks ago, and all four of us were so impressed. Tonite the chef was off and unfortunately, food was the antithesis of the other nite. What a shame. Brussels sprouts had NO flavor and ditto for the short ribs. Chicken was OK, salad was good, burger was to have no onion on it, but onion came on it so they removed the onion and brought it back! They brought us 4 desserts, but restaurants don't understand we like to go out for a meal that should be better than what I can make. This was not the situation tonite. The dessert did not sweeten an otherwise mediocre dinner. Very disappointed that the owner can't take a night off and be assured that the other chefs should be able to replicate the owner's style and excellence."}
{"text":"My husband & I went for happy hour on a Saturday after reading the good reviews online. The staff was super friendly - they made the white truffle scented macaroni & cheese for me even though it was not on the menu until after 5 pm (HH is from 4-6 pm).  My husband had the pork belly appetizer.   We considered getting a second round of both - they were that delicious.  We decided on the flat bread with sausage instead and it was really great.  I can't wait to go again for more of the mac & cheese and to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with some friends, and they suggested going here. I'm so glad they did. I loved the atmosphere. Our server, Tyler, was so great. He was funny, and it was fun to have him at our table. Everyone was so friendly that worked there. Now, let's talk about the star of the show...the food. OMG!!! I had the scallops. They were some of the best I've ever had. My hubby had the steak medallions with the truffle Mac and cheese. Tyler said it was life changing, and he was right..it was so good. Most of us got a salad to start. They were soooooo yummy. I do t like when they put too much dressing on. They put the right amount so you had some dressing, but the veggies still had their taste. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal, with a wonderful staff and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back for brunch or lunch. Give this place a try...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just had another amazing meal. Michael prepares wonderful combinations!! We celebrated my dad's birthday tonight and they made the evening extra special. If you want a special meal, Rusconi's is the place to go. Thank you Michael!!"}
{"text":"The hostess was a bit discombobulated.. But very young. We wanted a low top table but they wanted to sit us at the bar with a hightop table, another employee overheard and gave us a low top table we're seated right away.. The chef made a amazing meal the food was excellent. I had the beef medallions and my friend had the baked chicken and Rice. The portion were very small so I was still hungry when we were done.  Our service was slow took about 10m to get a glass of water and another five more minutes to get our beer & soda. She never did ask us if we wanted another drink. The check in offer was just for brunch :( so I didn't check in. The bar tender was awesome!! Made a few killer coffee martinis.. I took a picture of him so you be able to see who the excellent bartender was...  I will definitely return for the awesome great food and awesome drinks.. Nice place!   Side note.. The service was not terrible just compared to the chef and bartender service could use help."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back to this restaurant! I can't believe we live down the street and it took us this long to try this place out. We decided to keep it low key and stay in the neighborhood to celebrate our anniversary and chose this place because I wanted something new.   We love our neighbors and felt like we haven't seen them for quite a while so we asked them to join us. Plus, they were the ones that recommended this restaurant to us before. Brian and I started off with the goat cheese and charred tomato fondue. It was yummy but I think I'll have to try some other appetizers next time - like the crab cake special if it's still around. Bummed I didn't get it because I love crab cakes!   For my entree, I got the special - some sort of monkfish with saffron risotto? It was absolutely delicious! Brian got the short rib entree and said he really enjoyed it as well. I wish I had a picture of his dish. One of the neighbors ordered the kitchen sink burger and a side salad instead of fries. The salad looked mighty yummy.   For dessert, they had a Girl Scouts cookie item on the menu. It was a Samoa cookie pecan pie covered with berries and drizzled with some berry syrup. Hopefully, I can convince him to bring me here for Valentine's Day because there are so many things I want to try!"}
{"text":"Hmm, I wrote a review earlier and now can't find it.   Three of us had brunch here today and, again, it was wonderful.   The Kitchen Eggs Benedict was light, beautifully executed and just perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last Saturday night and our waiter Fritz was really great. We have had him several times. I can't say enough about his service        We both had the medallion with mac and cheese and it was great. I've had several meals here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh man, I love this place! I've eaten here for lunch before and really enjoyed it, but today's brunch was awesome! We had a party of 14, including 4 kids (nightmare of a table). The service was impeccable and the food was fresh and delicious.  Food: I ordered the Mediterranean Benedict which has prosciutto and tomatoes served on a thin ciabatta bread. The Benedict was served with a goat cheese hollandaise sauce and balsamic syrup. I'm not a goat cheese fan so substituted for regular hollandaise. The prosciutto was delicious and plentiful. The sauce was not too buttery and had great texture. My husband ordered the steak and eggs which came with filet medallions and raved about. Good kids menu, well priced and nice selection. $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's, both very good. A few us then split the stuff French toast with berries and marscopone cheese. Oh my goodness was that heaven!!! I should have taken a picture, but we all dug in too quickly.  Service: Stellar! It's not easy having a party of 14 and kids being included. Super nice waiter and quick to address any needs we had. Also, provided awesome recommendations.   Love this place! We will be sure be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Very nice experience at Rusconi. I am a highly critical food reviewer and I give this place an 8.2/10. Great job. Food great. Atmosphere great. There was a smudge on my plate so I knocked off some points and it was very busy so the service was not great. Price was expensive but on par for the services provided so no point deduction there.  Great job would go again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent,  hip place. Lucky find thanks to Yelp. We got the fondue and it's so rich and amazing. It's not like traditional  fondue, it's minimalist,  intense."}
{"text":"Great stop today with hubby Ordered lamb sandwich without bread and lamb flair was outstanding"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Friendly service. They could add to their non alcohol beverage selections and offer non drink desserts. bottom line if you enjoy drinking your dessert this place must be on your list you won't be disappointed but, if you enjoy a cake, cookie or pie it is not happening here.  However, if you just want a good meal stop in you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in north Phoenix/PV/Scottsdale.  I've been a regular since about a year after they opened and have never had a meal I would not rate excellent.  The wait staff are wonderful; very competent, personable and they remember your likes (I have no dislikes). My favorites are the pork osso buco, the steamed mussels and the desert chocolate bread pudding.  If you are lucky enough to get a reservation for a wine pairing dinner, you will leave thinking you may have glimpsed heaven.  Brunch and happy hour offerings are great as well. If  Rusconi's relocated, I would seriously considering moving to be close!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal.  We went at the last minute, they were very accommodating, and Hannah was a great waitress and wonderful server.  Thanks for a great evening of yummy food and the chocolate bread pudding that was fantastic."}
{"text":"First visit though we had seen it and read about it before. This was the first day of a new menu and there were good choices. The chef and the manager looked at every before delivering it which impressed us. My wife had the hamburger with goat cheese. She declared it great. I had the roasted chicken entree salad which was quite good. We shared posole soup before and loved it. Friend had a chicken sandwich.  We shared an order of berry enchiladas for dessert. There was a house wine special which I took advantage of. Wine was good. We had excellent service. We will return."}
{"text":"Wow! Rusconis is very impressive. The table we sat at was near the kitchen. It was very cool to see the head chef prepare every single dish! I ordered the beef medallions with truffle butter Mac and cheese. Quite possible the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. I also ordered the corn Bisque soup which was very tasty as well"}
{"text":"If I was an astronaut and going to get blasted to the INternational Space Station to eat packaged, packet food...and I had one last meal prior to lift off....It would be Rusconi's.  Greeted at the front door by Chef Michael Rusconi. Server was most attentive. Drinks very generous. Appetizer (Asparagus soup) was killer. Beet Salad...spectacular Entree...perfection Side dish of apple bread pudding with blue cheese on top...ORGASMIC Desert of Chocolate Coffee ice cream...delishiou Portions were great price was more than fair.  Actually a bargain  My wife and I have been in the Vally for 7 years.  This restaurant is one of the best we have ever eaten at.  We eat out three to four times a week....and this shot to the top of my list.  Been there twice and both experiences were over the top. Don;t miss it. Larry.  PS  The ONLY thing that I thought could use a touch of improvement; the bread was OK.  Easily fixed.  And..bread is full of carbs and I shouldn;t eat it anyway.  L O V E D  I T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I brought a newbie to Rusconi's and she said it's the best meal I've taken her to. The natural chicken was incredible as always, but this time the dessert absolutely floored us. The girlfriend said it's the best dessert she's ever had (creme brûlée). Thanks Mike and team!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour and their dinners are amazing too. Chef/owner is always watching everything going on in the open style kitchen, as well as the dining room."}
{"text":"weekday dinner. Sunday& MOnday half off wines! I had short ribs over red wine risotto. Delish! Everyone liked what they got except that filet mignon was a little dry. But that mac&cheese which came with it compensated for it :) Service was great too."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Ate here last night for the first time (my husband and daughter have been here before) and it was great.  Good service, inventive menu, inviting atmosphere.  Will definitely eat here again.  Love the happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and ordered the fresh sea bass and an appetizer of shrimp and grits. Phenomenal! I have also had the steak tenderloin with truffle mac and cheese which was terrific, as well. The apple moonshine martini is another must have. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday for Mother's Day, took my mom there, it seems like they were not prepared, first off we ordered drinks/ Pine apple Express, they said they were out!  And not to mention they took for ever to get are drinks, then for appetizers/starters we order the house smoked salmon, guess what?   Yup they were out of that too. Then for our main course we wanted to order the  house smoked salmon with poached eggs and lemon dill hollandaise,  they were out of that too!  Also we've noticed a peace of hair in food, that explains, the chefs were not wearing a chefs hat.   I've never been into a restaurant that was out of drinks/ starters or main course.  I will never go back there again!!!! That was the first and the last time!!!!"}
{"text":"I chose Rusconi's for my birthday dinner after it popped up on Yelp as having good vegetarian options, and watching the Check Please Arizona spot about it. I had corn chowder to start, with the squash and goat cheese bread pudding for my entree, and the brie cheesecake for dessert. My husband had a salad starter, mussels (which he said reminded him of those he had in Paris), and chocolate bread pudding. I'm not normally that into cheesecake but was impressed with Rusconi's.   I asked about additional vegetarian options besides the savory bread pudding, and our server said I could do a variety of the side dishes. Based on the veggies that came with my entree, I think that would be a nice way to go, possibly with an additional starter. It was really hard to choose just one of those anyway!  Everything we ate was delicious, and the service was excellent. As a guest, I felt very well taken care of -- they even called the next morning to thank us for dining with them. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 2 for outside seating, comfy chairs and the wine. The appetizer board was lame. The olives were fine , but bread was hard as a rock , meat was fatty and limited cheeses weren't a good pic. The 30.00 tender lion was far from tender . The piece I gave my daughter to try was, \" chewing on shoe leather\" . Overcooked Mac and cheese, pasta turns mushy. Disappointed , wish I had not been swayed into giving up my original destination. Special occasion, so I let my daughters pick.  This place was packed, either my chef was having a off night or people don't really know what GOOD food tastes like."}
{"text":"After a long and disappointing day driving out to the Grand Canyon and being rained out, we pulled into Rusconi's starving and underdressed.  NEVER did they make us feel less than welcome, and our server, Hannah, was awesome and knowledgeable!  The food was superb--we started with the white truffle mac and cheese, which I hesitated to order after his highness Gordon Ramsay pilloried white truffle oil, but my kids wanted it, so they beat Lord Swears-alot hands down.  It was great, and just the right amount.  Each of my kids then had the kitchen burger, which was ground in-house, layered with goat cheese, carmelized balsamic onions and tomato jam, and cooked perfectly to medium-well and medium-rare (my son likes his rarer than my daughter!); I had the buffalo sirloin steak with fingerling potatoes, also cooked medium rare, perfectly and uniformly prepared.  The wine reduction was so savory I felt like licking the plate!  Funny enough, the place started to clear out rapidly, and we looked down to our phones to see that there was a sandstorm warning!  Hannah explained that it's a pretty serious thing, so we expedited our leaving and headed back to the hotel!  My only wish is that we'd been offered the summer tasting menu (a steal at $40!), which I only discovered after looking at their website afterwards...  All in all, still a great experience!  Will definitely be back next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It had some nice eclectic dishes and tasty. I just think it's a little overrated. I think these days a lot of people prefer less oil, healthier choices."}
{"text":"Food was great! Culinary team very creative, portions jus tthe right size. Nice Wine list! Be sure to make reservations, gets crowded fast and the restaurant is no that big."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. If you're looking for perfect portions of delicious food, give Rusconis a try! Every time I visit, I leave full but not painfully stuffed. I love the fact that this place is a locally owned restaurant with great service!   On my last visit, Colin was our waiter and he was great! Very attentive but not overly annoying, which is always nice. I've been here many times and everything is tasty. From appetizers, salads, dinner and desserts, they are all delicious."}
{"text":"The noise level near the bar is simply over-the-top if your table is located near the hostess desk. That said, we decided to wait for another table to open up even though we had reservations. They were able to seat us in a less congested and noisy area in about 15 minutes. The service at the table was simply outstanding. I had the Hook & Ladder Chardonnay and it was very good. Their wine selection is very good. My friend ordered the Salmon and she thought it was extremely tasty. My husband had the braised short ribs that I've ordered in the past and said they melt in your mouth--knives need not apply! I tried something new--the veggies with bread pudding. I have to say the bread pudding with goat cheese was pretty tasteless, so I would not recommend it. Overall, this place aims to please and I even got a follow up call the next day to see how we liked the restaurant. Impressive!"}
{"text":"The food is very good! I never leave this place unhappy.  The service is just as wonderful.  My husband and I usually go here for birthdays. I highly recommend Rusconi's!"}
{"text":"Our second time here and it has been a 5 star experience on both visits.  It has become a must visit locale on our annual trek to Phoenix. Why?  The food is wonderful, the service attentive and the price points for such extraordinarily prepared and delicious food very reasonable.  The owner/chef and his wife show a great pride of ownership and the diner is the beneficiary of their endeavor.   Thanks to Nancy who took our reservation, we were seated at the community kitchen table which allows one to see the prep operation, line chef and waiters kitchen interaction-normally an operation that takes place behind closed doors.  This approach makes the staff much more in tune with the food and the patrons they serve.  Approachable, answering questions about ingredients etc., the proximity to the kitchen operation adds a new dimension to ones dining experience.  (The majority of tables are located away from the action if that's not your thing however.)   We love it and recommend trying it! The food... There were no misses!  Two of us had the set menu, four courses for $40.00 that offered all the most favorite dishes mentioned in the majority of the reviews here.  From the salmon to the macaroni-it was well worth it.  One had the pork tenderloin which was moist and flavorful.   I forgot to mention the fine martinis, try the pear martini!  Bookmark this restaurant, pay it a visit and enjoy a great evening.  Very nice and hardworking owners that deserve your patronage for delivering beautiful, flavorful food at a reasonable price.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and when we entered tonight I realized we were here 2 years ago.  It is a really nice little restaurant.  The service was excellent and the food good.  I had the field greens salad which was very good, but needed to be colder. My husband had the bisque and he said it was excellent. He had the appetizer sampler for his entree and I had the mussels.  The mussels were good, but the broth lacked flavor. We will be back, but I do wish they had a pasta dish and a few more non-meat options."}
{"text":"We are excited to have a new, non-chain restaurant in the area, but found the service to be slow and our server uninformed about menu.  Flatbread was dry and burned on the bottom. We plan on returning when they have been open a little longer and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"It's not often that I'm the last of my family to try a culinary establishment in the valley, but tonight was just such an occurrence.  I've dined a number of times at Lon's at the Hermosa, where Chef Rusconi first earned critical acclaim.  But until tonight I had not tried his new place, which has apparently garnered its own legion of fans (if Yelp is any indication).  My Mom had been here a number of times and is a passionately devoted fan of the restaurant.  So we decided to dine together so she could show me what I've been missing.  The restaurant is tucked in amidst a huge shopping center on Tatum & Shea, just a stones throw from Paradise Valley Mall.  When you walk in, you're immediately greeted with an atmosphere and a look of a restaurant that is refined, but also casual.  There's a nice bar as well as some patio seating up front.  Towards the back you walk past a nice fireplace and a decent assortment of wines on the wall.  We got a reservation for two, but there was plenty of seating on Sunday that we really didn't need it.  Almost as if psychic, our host knew my Mom easily gets cold and sat us next to the fireplace.  The menu changes with whats in season as Chef Rusconi apparently makes a point of it to source as much of his ingredients locally as possible.  Prior to arriving, I had my heart set on one dish in particular.  The beef tenderloin medallions with mac & cheese.  But before I could order, the waiter reminded me that night was beef short rib night.  Suddenly the gameplan changed.  I got the beef short rib with spaetzle, carrots, and green beans dressed in an au jus.  For an appetizer beforehand I got their white truffle mac n cheese so I could get my mac n cheese fix.    The mac n cheese was served hot in a little pot and was delicious.  Super creamy, noodles were cooked perfectly, and the portion was perfect for sharing.  The short ribs were also good, though I wouldn't say its the best short rib I've had.  It was a little tougher and not as tender as short ribs I've had at places like Beckett's Table and Crudo.  It was still tasty, but I probably should've gone with the tenderloin this time around. My Mom got the Scottish Salmon with a blackberry glaze, potatoes and veggies.  She loved this dish, particularly the glaze.  For dessert, my Mom and I split a pair of dishes.  A dark chocolate creme brûlée, and a brie cheesecake with fruit compote.  These were both a home run.  I'm not a dark chocolate guy generally, but this creme brûlée was fantastic.  Great texture, the chocolate was super creamy and rich.  The brie cheesecake was also outstanding with a great contrast of sweetness with the fruit and the savory of the brie and a soft crust to boot.  Total pricing for the appetizer, two main courses, two desserts, two glasses of wine, tax, and tip was $135.  My Mom actually had a Rusconi's gift card and I had an Open Table Dining Cheque (which they do honor) so that discounted our meal a bunch.  Overall I was pretty impressed with the place and the food was also pretty impressive.  It wasn't perfect nor did it have an OMG factor in my opinion, but I would absolutely come back for another bite.  And the ambience is great for dates, small groups, or whatever the occasion.  I mean, its Mom approved, so its gotta be good, right?"}
{"text":"Excellent little neighborhood restaurant.  Very refreshing to see a thoughtful, interesting menu expertly executed. I'm a new regular!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to find an American restaurant anymore where you are expected to trust the chef.  It's usually pick an entree and pick a side.  Rusconi's is one of those establishments where the chef does not just craft each dish; Rusconi actually pairs the entree with the sides.  This is refreshing.  Take, for example, the first meal I had there: the pork osso buco.  It is served with prickly pear-braised red cabbage, grilled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  If you don't like those sides, you don't deserve to eat the pork osso buco.  That's really all there is to it.  That may sound harsh, but that is how art should be. (To be fair, I don't know if Rusconi does substitutions.  I was never churlish enough to ask.)  I have also had the Durham Ranch Buffalo Sirloin and the Rack of Lamb.  Both were cooked perfectly.  One thing I should note about this place is it's not for the person who wants to leave stuffed.  The portions are not huge, but they are satisfying.  This is how restaurants should be; overeating is one of the biggest public health issues we face as a society.  Thank you Chef Rusconi for doing your part to fix this.  I love that I can still go for a run after eating dinner here."}
{"text":"Extraordinary Brunch experience! Tucked surprisingly in a strip mall area of the North East side of Tatum and Shae, Rusconi's is a delightful dining experience. We were able to make brunch reservations which were followed up with an email reminder.  Upon arrival our table was waiting and so was the personal service. We lingered unhurried over mimosas and bloody Mary's before making our selections from a menu that included appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pancakes and omelettes. My delectable omelette was fluffy and filled with shrimp, vegetables and cheese with a moderate portion of fingerling potatoes.  My aunt chose simple eggs which she reported were cooked to perfection. Our attentive waiter, Fritz, was friendly and efficient    He made it a fun experience. The price range was reasonable for the ambiance (quite chatter), immaculate environment and creative food with appealing  presentation. We cannot wait to return for their happy hour  (Monday - Friday 4-6).  We peeked at the menu and drink list and it looks like a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"So good!  Our son ordered the short ribs, my husband ordered the chicken with green chile mac and cheese, and I had the casing menu.  It was all delicious.  The server, Brian, was attentive and provided great service without being intrusive.  The manager brought several courses of the tasting menu to our table (did I say it was delicious?), and everyone seemed to work as a team.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  I was in town for two days and we had dinner at Rusconi's both nights. Once you have eaten there, there is no other place to go! Wished they had Rusconi's in Los Angeles! Maybe Michael could open up a restaurant here as well? Thank you for being such a great chef and restauranteur."}
{"text":"I'm a returning customer and happy to say once again; delighted.  Today our server was Tray, (I apologize if I mispelled your name...).   My friend and I brought our mothers to brunch; redeeming recent coupons from the paper.  Our server was fabulous, patiently kind, attentive, and a gentleman.  One of us in our party had alot of special requests when ordering; our server never batted an eye.  We ordered three different eggs benedicts among us and and an order of huevos rancheros; excellent.  I had the Arizona Benedicts which featured pork chili verde; fantasic.  We redeemed coupons, and then some...never ever felt we weren't given the best of everything  they offered.   The mimosas were excellent and a full glass that were at least a 50/50 pour; thank you!   There was a little struggle in separating the two tabs; separate tabs were requested before ordering.   However, aside from an extremely good and leisurely brunch, our server was outstanding.  Thank you again."}
{"text":"Every meal I've had at Rusconi's has been terrific.  We've recently discovered that, since the minimum wage hike raising lunch prices all over, Rusconi's is barely more than the fast food/fast casual places for lunch (like the same cost as Panera Bread, less tip)...and the food and service are orders of magnitude better.  Try to sit in Norbert's section - he's a fantastic server and really elevates the dining experience.  I'll come back and review selected items later...working my way through the lunch options (but the daily specials are so good I'm not sure how long it will take to work through the standard items!)  If you work near Rusconi's, put them on your every-couple-of-weeks lunch rotation.  (You can thank me later)."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week. Friendly, knowledgeable staff,and good food. My salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special - green chili stew."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Popped in for Friday night date night and had a wonderful . Great service, waiter was knowledgeable and friendly and funny. Felt very much like a neighborhood watering hole with a great upscale vibe. We will most defintimeitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot to have lunch! The sweet potato and corn soup was different but really good!! I got the turkey sandwich with red pepper and sweet potato. Solid. A couple friends with me got the BLT and the short rib sandwich. Both great as well! Service was very friendly and attentive! Would recommend."}
{"text":"A rare local gem! We have been here few times over the years and they never disappoint. Tonight was no exception. We were seated right away with no reservation but I strongly recommend making one so you are not disappointed. It was a beautiful night out so we dined out the small patio. Previously we have dined inside which was warm, cozy, and comfortable. The service tonight fantastic as in previous visits. Our server was attentive without hovering and charming.   We started our meal by sharing the boneless short rib with a chocolate chili sauce. The meat was tender and the flavor was delicious. I had the beef tenderloins with a side of truffle Mac and cheese. The beef was perfect but I would have been just as happy with a bowl of that delicious macaroni and cheese! My mom ordered the scallops which she said melted like butter in her mouth. For dessert we shared the Brie cheesecake with fresh berries."}
{"text":"Fabulous night with the hubs. Food was exceptionally well prepared- amazing blend of flavors perfectly complementing each other. Left totally satisfied, full but not uncomfortably so. Our server Brian was first rate and incredibly professional- steering us to some amazing choices. I will be back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"The peach fondue is very good. Servers are prompt and mostly attentive. Food was good, but not outstanding. We felt the menu was creative, but pricey for the size of the servings. Very limited menu. The main reason I didn't  give a higher rating is we were a party of four.  Three were served their food at the same time; it was almost 10 minutes before the last person was served. Of course our food was cold by then. There was no apology given for meal being delayed."}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience offering a wide variety of wine and entree options.  Very nice wait staff that provide spot on recommendations.  Outstanding scallops and chocolate bread pudding as well as their filet that was offered as a special.  We enjoyed our dining experience and will be back soon."}
{"text":"The happy hour mussels for $6 were well worth it, great flavor and very fresh.  The sliders were super flavorful and the fries that came with it were great too.  Great value and nice atmosphere.  Very friendly service and nice to see a non-chain restaurant in our neighborhood.  Next time we'll try the highly recommended truffled mac-n-cheese."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on YELP reviews and also because it was a choice on Arizona Restaurant Week.    Arrived with a group of 4 people and a baby.  3 of us ordered off the restaurant week menu. I chose the shrimp appetizer (pan roasted gulf shrimp), Australian Sea Bass with roasted fingerling potatoes, and the Panna Cotta Passionfruit dessert.   I have to get all my food modified to be made without butter, cheese or milk and still it was all incredible tasting. The Panna cotta was gluten and dairy free. Everyone enjoyed their meal and all 4 of us agreed that we would all love to come back here for another meal."}
{"text":"Rusconi's is less than a mile from our home and so we are regulars.  The food is fresh and well prepared.  The drinks are quite good as well.  They are good about making whatever drink you want.  Each day they have a special Budini for dessert.  I have had several of them and they have all been very good (though I wish they would bring back the Elvis).  Service is usually excellent and fun.  This is a great place and we are lucky to have it in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Everything from the Kitchen table appetizer with assorted cheeses and meats, to the braised rib over green Chile grits, tenderloin over truffle Mac and cheese, paired with a full bodied Cabernet, was exquisite. To finish our amazing meal, we tried the chocolate bread pudding; a wonderful compliment to end our meal...The service from Brian was superb, above any service we have received anywhere else we have dined. Brian was personable and professional...well done Chefs and staff. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Love it! Tried it a few weeks ago for dinner, where have I been?!  Great food, drinks, service, ambiance. When seated at the bar you can see the kitchen. Nice menu, plenty of options, wish they had a chocolate dessert available (I got chocolate issues ).  Great find, will have to try brunch."}
{"text":"Rusconi's used to be a favorite in the happy hour rotation for my fiancé and I. They have a nice selection of food and drink options and are reasonably priced. They offer a tasty brunch as well.   We came in this afternoon (Saturday) around 4:45 and were promptly seated at a high top table behind the hostess stand in the bar area. At this point the bar was relatively full and there were a couple other tables seated in the area. About five minutes in to our wait, the server of the other seated tables in the area looked over and said he'd be back shortly. For the next 15 minutes we waited as he attentively addressed the needs of the other tables without even stopping by to take our drink order. At that point, we decided our money would be better spent at a restaurant across the street and walked out the door. An unfortunate first for me."}
{"text":"Wow!! Went to Rusconi's for the first time today for dinner!! Epic meal!!! The crab cake appetizer was as delicious as it was beautiful!! The grouper was fantastic as well as was the tenderloin medallions!! We added on the scallops!! The scallops were perfect!! Risotto was THE bomb!! Our waiter Craig was amazing!! Met Chef Rusconi and he was as gracious as he is a talented and accomplished chef!!! Excellent meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can not believe how good this place is!  The atmosphere is completely unexpected.  The space is next to a Panda Express, but as soon as you walk in to this restaurant, you feel like you are at a resort.    The service was amazing and the food was even better.  We had a pork belly app, roasted chicken and squash ravioli entrees and a chocolate bread pudding for dessert.    We will certainly be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with friends, and both times the experience was great from start to finish. Arrived with a reservation, and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Very knowledgeable waiter who suggested drink pairings and offered suggestions from the daily specials as well as the seasonal menu. Everything ordered turned out great, boneless short ribs, are a starter worth ordering again. Entrees were reasonable in size though there were no left overs to box for a future meal. I had the pork osso bucco, which turned out great, and while I'm not generally a big fan of some vegetables I had no trouble cleaning my plate as they were all seasoned in delicious ways. The only reason I'm not a more regular customer is the location is not convenient for me."}
{"text":"Refreshing, down home servers who efficiently provide the specials, along with prices. Broad menu and you do catch yourself salivating and  staring at dinner eats passing by.  A mistake in a drink order is politely corrected within minutes.  Broad menu options - including short ribs - may remind you of your favorite restaurant, unless you've forgotten it already...Barrata salad, buffalo sirloin, and crab cake were all memorable. Drinks reasonable (thank you.)"}
{"text":"The best lunch my wife and I have had in a very long time!  And we've had some very good food recently.  Our server was delightful, funny, and also very helpful.  The bartender made some custom drinks, and went above and beyond our expectations.  The owner/chef actually delivered our food, and told us about some of the complexities of the dishes that don't always come across with just a text menu.  Awesome experience!...we really enjoyed it, and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Our first visit - we heard glowing reviews and they were spot on! We started with the Beet Salad wonderfully refreshing, Selected Salmon and the nightly special a prime rib-eye steak both exceeded the expectation. Finished with bread pudding couldn't be any better! Can't wait to go back.The Service was great."}
{"text":"There are a few times I try a new restaurant and the drinks are as great as the food. I tried their margarita that was wonderful spicy and clean! The bartender was great and friendly!  For food we tried the \"beef sliders\" offered @ Happy Hour and it was a nice start for two. We then ventured into the dinner menus and ordered the grilled salmon and the beef medallions. The salmon was delicious with the right amount of outer crispiness almost blackened with a delicious blackberry glaze, served with fingerling potatoes, roasted carrots, and cabbage. The beef medallions were also a good choice and done to perfection.  They were served over truffle Mac and cheese, with carrots and green beans. I was impressed with the food that was served here and we ate all this at the bar. You will enjoy this upbeat atmosphere and good food and service! So, go ahead and try this place and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center near Paradise Valley mall. The menu is inventive and delicious; the staff is friendly and knowledgable. The happy hour menu offers a lot of great wines and beers which only adds to its appeal. Enjoy the front patio if the weather is nice. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Green chile mac and cheese, buffalo and salmon. Everything was awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Check this place out! It's restaurant week and they have a great 3 course menu for $33!!!!!! I had lovely cauliflower soup, fabulous short ribs,and we tried every dessert on the menu. The service is great. I would put this restaurant in the same league as Beckett's or Milagro Grill.........we will be back!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just what we needed in Paradise Valley!!  We first ate here July 25th, 2013 & we had a great time & enjoyed the camaraderie with the staff & among the patrons as well.  It's a lively place but not a nightclub.  There is ample bar area seating with a flatscreen TV (where we chose to eat) & the restaurant is larger than appears from the outside.  The kitchen is clean & very organized (& it was humming on this particular night) which is certainly a plus as it is open & visible from most tables.  The menu consists of delectables such as cream of asparagus soup, creative salads & top-notch gourmet entrees (Osso Bucco, Beef Tenderloin, Salmon & a hearty burger).  The bartender also has skills - cocktails range from the classics to the more trendy & there's a lot of them - specialties are written on a chalkboard just behind the bar & are solid & original.  On the particular night we dined (a Thursday night), the place was packed & it appeared they may not have been ready for the onslaught - the staff was thinly stretched but handled the chaos with aplomb.  Our entrees took a little bit longer than expected but we enjoyed ourselves during the wait because of the happy atmosphere with its slightly-rugged decor & delicious aromas wafting about.  The wine list is more than satisfactory & they have an extensive list of top-notch brands for any discernible palate.  Rusconi's will definitely be our go-to place in the neighborhood - with their great gourmet menu & casual vibe, who wouldn't love this place?!  The only thing that would make it better would be some good jazz (like Mindy Abair, Dave Koz or Euge Groove) piped in over a speaker or two - but maybe with all the energetic banter going on in the place, you might not hear it."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner her last Friday.  It was our second time dining here.  I won't review each dish we ordered because all you need to know is that anything you order will be fantastic.  You cannot make a bad choice.  The place isn't huge so I would recommend making a reservation, but if you are an early bird like my wife and I, it won't be a problem getting a table.  Service is generally pretty good even though we lost our waitress a few times during our last visit.  The only other thing that pissed me off was that they charged for blue cheese olives for my martini.  They were 75 cents each which isn't a big deal.  The big deal was that they charged at all.  I have never been to a place in my entire life that charged for specialty martini olives."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight with my sister and we loved it! We got the beef tenderloin medallions and the scallops and we got a fig and arugula appetizer with the figs that the chef grew in his backyard! The steak was served on a bed of truffle mac & cheese and It was absolutely amazing! we will be back"}
{"text":"I soo wanted to love this place. It sounded just right. Space is fine, vibe is very nice, decor restful, staff polite ... But:  1. I came specifically for the Osso Boco, I was there 15 minutes after start time , at 5:15 pm, & I was told they're out of it & can't make any more for at least 1 hr or 1 1/2 hrs. Say what? 2.  After 25 minutes I called the waiter over & asked if we could perhaps have some bread: \"Oh, you want bread? We don't serve it unless you ask. \"  Say what?? 10 minutes later 2 slices of stale over toasted French bread appeared.  3. Scallops. 4 for $24. $6 a pop. Nice presentation, but totally over seasoned. Beautiful scallops turned into salt bombs!  & not a sign or hint of any gesture of trying to make it better, not have a glass of wine on the house, or how about some dessert on us,  nothing. Not even were sorry please give us another chance.   Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best lunch I've had in Phoenix ever, I've lived in Phoenix over 38yrs.They do everything right and I mean everything! Excellent waiters, Fantastic food and every entree was inspected before it was even served. Our waiter even mixed us up sweet tea. I Was VERY VERY IMPRESSED!"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed Rusconi's by ourselves, with friends and with a group.  Always fun and always fabulous food.  The staff is great the food is yummy with wonderful presentation, there are always a few \"ooh and aahs\" when we get our plates."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for dinner and we were thoroughly impressed!  Nice atmosphere with a small patio, ample bar space with seating and a large dining room overlooking the kitchen.  The service was efficient, friendly and led us in the right direction when making our menu choices.  We started with the grilled peach and goat cheese fondue and the amish blue cheese and apple salad...both were delicious!  We shared our server's two favorite entrees - the salmon with blackberry glaze served with potatoes, carrots and brussel sprouts & the natural chicken served with green chili risotto and carrots.  Both were simple, flavorful and downright tasty.   We will definitely be back as there were so many tasty items to choose from on the menu!"}
{"text":"We selected this restaurant to celebrate my parent's 60th wedding Anniversary, because the menu had something for my vegetarian sister, meat and potatoes father, and food lovers all. We were not even slightly disappointed. Everything was perfect, from the service, to dessert. The American Onion Soup satisfied my picky father and husband, their take on a Caprese salad was phenomenal, wish so bad I could have the recipe for the tomato sorbet, though not sure how I'd freeze it anyway. My mom's salad was the best she's had in a long while - the vinaigrette just the right amount and not too vinaigary, the blue cheese puffs, perfection.  On to the main courses. Can't remember what the vegetarian bread pudding entree was, but looked as good as my sister said it was. The spare ribs, scallops and salmon were perfect. My guess is anything else we might have ordered would have been equally wonderful. Deserts were awesome as well. The homemade butter pecan ice-cream was as much pecan as ice cream, if you like it nutty, this will be a great choice for you. The creme brûlée and other custard dessert (can't remember the name of it) were good - but the real killer dessert is the chocolate bread pudding with salted caramel sauce, oh my gosh, incredible."}
{"text":"Interesting menu but don't repeat my mistake and order the scallops entree. I got 4 small scallops with some green (cabbage) piled in the middle on white and orange sauce. It should been a starter dish and not an entree for $28.00.   When I complained to the waiter he just ignored me and the manger \"conveniently\" showed up after the bill was paid."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  Went there for lunch 10/27 and ordered  the blackberry glazed salmon salad. Salad was soggy ... certainly not freshly dressed. Had to be sitting in dressing for a while. The salmon piece on my plate was so ridiculously small it was offensive that they sent that out. I have NEVER had a portion so small. Spoke with the manager, who was very nice but, he defended their lunch portion size and said I should order the dinner portion next time. Really?  How about you just serve a decent cut of salmon! First of all, I weigh 120 lbs, so I don't eat very much to begin with. I've never gone for lunch and had a protein on my salad that I had to make a comment about.  I would never go back.  With all of the great restaurants in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area I wouldn't waste my time or money there again.   If you need to charge more for a larger portion just do it, but don't skimp on what you're serving your customers. Between the salad itself being limp from sitting in salad dressing and the portion of the salmon, that did it for me."}
{"text":"This particular day I was having one of the worst days in a long time.  I wasn't feeling well and I wanted to relax and have dinner with my mom.  So we were in the area of Tatum and Cactus and I decided to Yelp something from my phone.  I discover this fine little establishment with what looked to be a spectacular menu.  I thought, \"If they can pull this off, I am in.\"  Pull it off they did, indeed.  Not only did they turn my whole day around, but I discovered a fantastic new restaurant.   We walk in, they place has only been open a few weeks, we were promptly greeted with warm inviting smiles and everyone was extremely friendly.  The build out of the restaurant was really nice and I was excited to sample the menu.  The only problem I could see, was that I could not possibly eat every dish.    I chose the Boneless Short Ribs, which came out so tender and moist and delicious, I was in heaven.  It was accompanies with a Sweet Potato mash, that was 'vanilla scented' according to the menu.  The short ribs had ancho chili chocolate sauce on top, just a light glaze that really brought out the flavor in the short ribs.  The entire meal was delightful with great service and great wine.   My mom chose to have the the Butternut Squash filled ravioli which has a delightful sauce over them and resting on a baby spinach bed.  They were fresh made, I think they make everything there.  These were awesome!  The fulling was not sweet, it tasted like they did nothing but puree the squash, simple, elegant and perfect as it is.    Apparently Rusconi's uses local produce for their menu and that insures freshness of each dish they provide.  I would definitely recommend dining here.  I saw they even had a nice happy hour menu also, available at the bar only. My next stop will be happy hour for sure. Keep up the good food and service!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We ordered lunch specials and we were super impressed! The salmon was cooled to perfection and very nicely presented."}
{"text":"Had a very mediocre experience here. I was really excited to try due to it's proximity to my parent's house. I was thinking it would be a good place for us to frequent. The food was nothing special, my order was wrong, and the service sporadic. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for many years and have driven by this place countless times but never checked it out. I always thought, how good can it really be it's in a strip mall, but looks can be deceiving. From the moment we entered we were treated graciously by the wait staff and welcomed personally by the manager. Service was impeccable and unbelievably friendly but not overbearing. The food was solid and not overly complicated but in a good way.  I selected the sea scallops over grits and brussels sprouts topped with cabbage. The scallops were generously sized, not gritty and were cooked to perfection. The mix of sweet, salty and bitter worked quite well together and I highly recommend it. My wife had the salmon and it was quite good and again a solid dish and well cooked. It had a delicious berry glaze and smoky pecan taste throughout. Dinner completed with a berry bondino which was excellent. Not too sweet and was a great conclusion to the meal. Overall highly recommended and I hope to visit again."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! We came here Christmas weekend to celebrate my mom's birthday. I mentioned in the reservation why were dining but I figured like most restaurants they would forget or not pay attention. As soon as we were seated Craig, our server, asked my mom what she would like for her birthday drink and from then on throughout the night he treated her like a queen! Craig had the most genuine, exceptional customer service and made the whole evening special for my mom and our whole party. The food was fantastic as well but Craig made the night memorable. We will definitely come back here to celebrate a special occasion, or no occasion, just to dine on the wonderful food and enjoy the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.  Rusconi's didn't.  THE GIST: Modern American menu / Inconsistent seasoning / Service needs work  FOOD HIGHLIGHTS  Goat Cheese Fondue with Pita Bread: The fondue was good, the pita bread used to dip it was not.  Our first batch had lukewarm pita bread that had a chewy, dare-I-say microwaved consistency.  After our table finished the first round of pita bread, they were kind enough to offer a second; this batch came out burnt, but this time with a sitting-on-the-counter-too-long consistency.  Cheeseburger with Fries: Several members of my party ordered this one, one of them asking for no salt on the fries.  Everybody else got crunchy, but very salty fries.  Her order seemed to have a batch of unsalted fries sitting atop a batch of salted fries, because there was definitely salt at the bottom of her bowl.  The burger itself was unremarkable.  Ossobuco: This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly under-seasoned and rather dry.  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but dry ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.  Not recommended.  CONCLUSION  It's trendy, it's big, and it's American, but there are too many places pulling this concept off correctly for me to recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"What a nice addition to this area of town! You don't necessarily expect to find an eating establishment of such high quality in a shopping complex. Rusconi's is nestled between a Panda Express & My Big Fat Greek. With the lack of street visibility, you just might just overlook this gem - look for the huge wooden entry door (which almost gives the appearance that the place is boarded up if you are just driving by).  One step inside, and you know right away that this is no ordinary strip mall eatery. Very inviting décor, and beautifully decorated with and upscale feel, but not pretentious.   We didn't have a reservation - this was a weeknight and the place was busy! A couple of seats opened up at the bar so we opted for them instead of waiting. The bartenders greeted us right away and introduced themselves (Dave, Zack and \"the new guy\")  and started us off with our adult libations.   We skipped the starters and dove right into the entrees: Roasted Natural Chicken and Grilled Salmon. The salmon, with a wonderful blackberry glaze, was grilled to perfection. And delicious, too! When the chicken dish was delivered, I was told that the plate was very hot. And it was - at least half of it. And the food itself was lukewarm - tasty, but disappointing. I mentioned this fact and my dish was whisked away to be made right. When the next one was delivered, it was piping hot...and oh, so good! Chef Michael Rusconi's green chili mac 'n cheese is wonderful! The chili does not overpower the dish so you get a wonderful layering of flavors. The chicken was very moist and super-flavorful.  This is going to be one of our \"go-to\" places! Great ambience, delicious food, reasonable prices - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We ate there last night with my parents. They loved it, we also love it! Our server Brian was excellent, we all loved him. Wonderful meal with dessert. Will be back again"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing - it's one of my very favorites in the area. Their Sunday brunch is incredible. I can't get enough of the Arizona toast (multi grain bread with avocado and green chili and a fried egg. Add an extra egg - you're welcome. All of the Benedict's are also superb. And during brunch they have $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's. Oh and if you are so inclined they also have half price bottles of wine. You would never expect what is inside this place from the outside but you will be thankful you tried it. Also the wait staff is incredible. And killer happy hour specials, including green chili and short rib sliders."}
{"text":"We had seen a lot of good reviews of this place.   It was very hard to find since it is sandwiched between a Panda Express and a Coreleones which both have bright signs that overwhelm the Rusconi sign.  First sat at the bar waiting for my wife to arrive.  The Bartender was great.  I ordered a couple of things off the happy hour menu as my wife called to say she was going to be late.  The Kitchen Board was a good price on happy hour but I was very disappointed by the cheese selection, cheese curds and some small triangles of a sage cheddar.   I also had the Mussels which were very flavorful but only four of them.   Now it was the happy hour order so I hope there are more on the regular seeing as they are $17.  We ordered a set menu which was $40 per person for 5 courses.  First up was an avocardo soup. While the soup was very well prepared it lacked in flavor. The second course was a salad with shrimp which I found to be very good but my wife found the dressing to be a little overpowering.  The salad had shrimp on it that looked like they had been sliced to give the appearance of more.  Third course was scallops with grits.  Nice dish but my scallops had grains of sand in them.   Fourth course is where things started to go wonky. I will say at this point that the Chef and owner was the expediter.   All the servers had to go through him to get extras like salt.  The fourth course was a lamb porterhouse.  I asked if I could get some mint Jelly with mine.  I was told that there was no mint jelly so I asked if they had mint sauce.  No to that too.  My daughter ordered her's medium rare and it came out medium well. I ordered mine medium and it came out medium well.  My wife ordered medium well and it came out medium well.  I was ok with mine but my daughter sent her's back. The chef looked very annoyed both at the request for mint jelly and the lamb being sent back.  My daughter's lamb was returned rare, I mean it had been charred on the outside but was uncooked in the center.   We made them aware but did not sen it back.  The kicker was the desert.  Ahead of time we asked if we could have some ice cream with the desert and were told yes by the server.  The chocolate bread pudding arrived sans ice cream.  We decided we would wait.  After 5 minutes we called the server back and asked where the ice cream was.  He went back to the chef who was shaking his head.  When the server came back he said they had ice cream but we could not have any.  We said we would pay extra if that was the issue.  The server said that was not the issue.  He did not say what the issue was but I guess it was the arrogance of the chef not wanting his dishes altered.   Was the desert good? OH YES IT WAS.   But I have to give a lot of negative marks for the arrogance which I think was the reason for the limited cheese, limited number of mussels, raw lamb and ice cream being withheld.  Overall good service from the staff, pretty good food, but an arrogant chef. I will go back to see if it was perhaps just an off night."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service one of the best places to eat in the area. I recommend the chicken or salmon and the Mac n cheese is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had brunch on Sunday and it amazing!  Best banana foster pancakes ever. Mimosas and wine were great. Amazing service. Will have to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming.  I saw all the great reviews and thought I'd take my family here for Mother's Day brunch. When we were seated and handed the menu, we noticed there was a prix fixe menu. Adults got three courses for $58. Kids got eggs, bacon, and roasted potatoes plus desert for $18 and drinks were extra. $18 BUCKS for that was a joke, it should be under $10 with a drink.    The adult meal was weird and hard to pair some of the starters with the main courses. My wife had a lobster bisque that was ok, probably a little too creamy and no chunks of lobster or anything other than some seafood flavor to indicate it was actually made with lobster.  She also got steak and eggs as her main course and it was fine, but nothing special.  I got a short rib and grits for my starter, which had good flavor and was very tender. My entree was a crab and shrimp benedict that was very fishy. The roasted potatoes were nothing to write home about. I also got a bloody mary, which was very basic and reminded me of one I'd get on an airplane.  When the $197 bill arrived, I was appalled to pay that for two adults and two kids. Toss in tip (service was good) and we spent $240 on a meal that was underwhelming at best. Unfortunately, this restaurant did not come close to my expectations and I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but this time was different. The service was horrible. Maybe it was because we were sitting at a hightop in the bar area. But our server was not interested in helping us. Our server never introduced himself. He took a very long time to get our drink order and then longer to ask if we wanted food. He spilled wine on my friend, didn't apologize, and didn't come back to ask us if we wanted anything else for ages. Then asked us again if we wanted anything else, like he forgot we already said no. And then he took a long time to get our check. I don't know what happened. But this may be my last visit, and i go here a lot."}
{"text":"I love this place, one of my favorites! The mac n chz and french fries are the best, if they ever take off the menu, I'll be pretty upset. My son loves the salmon, I could drink that berry glaze. The servers we've encountered have been awesome, they really go out of their way to please. Every time we've been, the chef/owner has been there. Having worked in a kitchen, I can appreciate that kind of dedication and sacrifice. I'm sure that is why his restaurant is so successful. Would love to see vegetarian entrees!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't written a review for Rusconi's before. They've been around for a few years now. It's an unassuming spot in a strip mall but thank heavens it is an unassuming strip mall close to my house. This is my go-to spot. Honestly, there isn't anything that I don't like. The restaurant is well run. My table is ready when I get there. Service is friendly and attentive and smart - the servers know the menu and know the bar and are very willing to help me pair wines or select the best appetizer.  The food is beautiful. I don't just mean that it tastes good - it does. But they have a mis en place station where they dress each place and do QC before serving. It's fun to watch and they are attentive to detail.  I've had mussels and scallops many times and my husband usually goes for the osso bucco. Split a few things so that you can sample the menu and do ask for one of their signature cocktails. I'm a fan of their spicy margarita. So glad this place is in my path."}
{"text":"The beef medallions are life changing. I can not recommend this place enough. A true gem for the foodie in you. I love to bring my friends and they are always impress. Rusconi's has never let me down."}
{"text":"High expectations but didn't deliver.  The smokey Bloody Mary was nasty. I ordered the crocque Madame... Not a lot of flavor. Pork was tough and not flavorful. Dining companion liked the posole and apparently the chili verde was ok - but all of us were adding salt to bump up the flavors."}
{"text":"It's expensive, but worth it. My sister loved their truffle Mac and cheese and I loved their steak! It's a small space, so my family and I tend to get it to go since we are a huge party - but from what I saw when I went to pick up the food, the atmosphere seems really nice."}
{"text":"Came her with my sweet wife. I saw this recently on check please. Looked amazing. Read some recent elite reviews. One said the service was poor. For us it was AMAZING! We came at 4 and it was happy hour. They have a happy hour menu. We started with the grilled peach fondue. Good not great. The bread was \"toasted\" under a salamander and it tasted like butane. We told our server who was great and he fixed it right away. The untoasted bread was much better.   Short rib sliders. Yum. Juicy, beefy, with horseradish. Awesome.   Be advised that in general the portion sizes are on the smaller size and will only feed one. Nothing is really big enough to even share with your dining partner. That said everything was great except as noted.   Our server even came by and let us know he would be a way in a short nightly meeting and asked if we would be ok till then. I think they must read reviews on Yelp and have really tried to improve the service from what the recent elite experienced.  Beef medallions. Wow the chef knows how to cook proteins. The beef was perfectly cooked rare like I had requested. The scallops I added were also perfectly cooked. The dish as a whole lacked a bit of seasoning. The chef came by after our server inquired and I let him know I thought  things needed some salt. I think it was great that the chef took time to come by. The Mac and cheese was really good. Just not enough of it. I would have like a bit more.   Fingerling potatoes. Good. Well cooked. Firm not mushy. I would have preferred some crispiness.   Squash and goat cheese bread pudding. Initially my wife was meh but near the end of the meal she said she liked it but would not order it again. She did say that after she added salt is was much better.   White garnet yam potato salad. Nice and light.   Dark chocolate bread pudding. Very good.   Bree cheesecake. Very good take on regular cheese cake.   Service 5/5. Really amazing service. Food 5/5 because they made even small mistakes better."}
{"text":"Visited for the second time in the past 2 months and have been very happy both times with the food and the service. Have tried the salmon, beef medallions, lamb chops and the osso buca. All have been excellent with very tasty side dishes. Has a reasonable beer and wine list. Service has also been spot on both times, fast but not rushed. Give it a try if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"You absolutely must enjoy a meal at Rusconi's to truly appreciate what magnificence can come out of one kitchen.  I was visiting relatives in Anthem and we took the 30 minute drive through Phoenix to enjoy truly the best meal I have ever had.  I cannot adequately give credit to the grilled beef tenderloin medallions over truffle scented mac-n-cheese.  The experience was heavenly.  By comparison, my former favorite meal was pan seared salmon at the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore.  Rusconi's edged ahead of the Four Seasons!  This was an event!  In addition to a welcoming atmosphere and the excellent assistance of server Rex, the entire ambiance was terrific.  And here's another side bonus - the tables are not jammed together so I didn't have someone next to me breathing on my entree!  Major kudos to Michael Rusconi and his team for an amazing experience.  Thank you!  P.S. My sister had the scallops -- her response: \"The best scallops I've ever had\"."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience again at Rusconi's - great to have a local spot that delivers top notch service as well as incredible food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was great. Will defiantly come back. Free mimosa with check-in too!"}
{"text":"The appetizer you must have is the stuffed fig from Mrs. Rusconi's garden wrapped in prosciutto and served with arugula.  I had the grilled salmon, cooked perfectly, and asked to substitute spinach in place of potatoes, which was no problem.  My husband had steak and scallops on a bed of green pea risotto.  The risotto was unbelievable.  My daughter had to have the truffled garlic Parmesan French fries, and had to fight off her dad!  She also had grilled salmon.  For dessert we shared a watermelon sorbet, which tastes exactly the way a watermelon is supposed to taste except with the seeds and rinds! In short, a perfect finish to a perfect dinner.  Cool vibe-lots of energy but not too loud.  We will be back with business clients in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the chef is so personable! This was a fantastic dinning experience and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I will admit it was a rocky start. However after the general manager, Derek, brought us back into the restaurant, we had an amazing experience. The food is amazing, the servers are fun and knowledgeable and we even made friends with our neighboring table. We will definitely be back again and again to see what this amazing chef comes up with."}
{"text":"Even though I love the food here, I'm a little concerned that this place isn't going to make it.  The food is outstanding, but I think there is something wrong with management.  I was here on a recent Friday for happy hour, and while my bartender was attentive and very nice to me, he tossed a tip in another bartender's face (in front of customers) and called him some choice names.  It was awkward to say the least.  Also, even though the place was relatively empty (except for the bar area) my salad and other dishes took quite some time to come to the table.  My one other negative observation would be that management does not seem to be aware of what kind of alcohol they have available.  I was going to order a delicious cocktail that used Hendrick's gin (which nobody ever seems to have).  When I ordered the drink and complimented the bartender for their gin selection, the bartender looked really confused.  He told me they didn't have Hendrick's.  He wanted to sub it for Bombay, but Hendrick's is a unique Scottish gin, infused with rose and cucumber, so Bombay wouldn't have suited the cocktail.  He made me something else that was great, but when we were looking at the cocktail menu, we found another drink that required a brand of alcohol that they didn't have.  While all of these individual events aren't extremely unusual (coworkers fight, menus get screwed up), seeing them all in one visit is usually a sign that the manager isn't on top of it (especially allowing a bartender to have a dispute with a coworker in front of customers).  In any case, the back-of-the-house seems to have it together because the food is exceptional.  It's like eating comfort food, only better.  It's one of the few places I've eaten at that does grits well.  The roasted chicken salad with strawberries sounds really simple and it is, but it's extremely flavorful.  The sliders are great as well.  I've never had a bad dish here (the Kitchen Platter appetizer isn't bad, but it's definitely average--it's the only thing I would skip).  I think everything is priced as it should be, considering the quality and portions, EXCEPT for dessert.  The portions are pretty darn small considering the cost.  I would definitely visit them during happy hour and stay for dinner.  I hope they are able to overcome their staffing and menu hiccups so they can be around for a long time!  This neighborhood could use some quality restaurants that aren't chains."}
{"text":"I ordered the same meal I had last year and it wasn't BAD but it wasn't as good either. Last year I had the Brunch Salmon plate. (see photos) Last year it was nice and succulent. This year for dinner it was a smaller portion that was cooked just OK and was topped with Blackberry Glaze and oily fried cilantro. The vegetables under it weren't so tasty. I had slightly burnt tasting brussels sprouts a few over cooked carrot slices and one and one half fingerling potatoes. Maybe I'm old fashioned but when I go out to dinner I expect to receive at least a female weight watcher portion of food. That means I expect 4-5 oz of protein, half a cup of vegetables and 3 oz of potato. That one and one half fingerling potato sort of insulted me. Could you imagine having a dinner party and serving your guest only one and one half fingerling potatoes a person?  We started with the White Truffle Scented Mac-N-Cheese. It lacked Cheese and wasn't cheesy enough and the Truffle aroma didn't bring anything to the party. The pasta was slightly over done. I would not recommend this dish to anyone.  My husband had the Pork Osso Bucco. He said the braised cabbage was very good and the Osso Bucco was seasoned nicely but it wasn't as tender as they usually are. He also said the mashed potatoes were a little bland.  We shared a deep chocolate Bread Pudding with vanilla ice cream. I will say the vanilla sauce on the bread pudding was very good. I'm sure the bread pudding was home made but it had a flavor to it that tasted like cake mix to me. I liked the shaved white chocolate topping on it.  Service was good during most of dinner but at the end it turned diner style. Our waiter placed the check on the table with a dessert and didn't ask me if I wanted coffee or an after dinner drink.   2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"We decided to check out a different place tonight. The crab cakes were the best I have had in Arizona. My salmon dinner was great. Anna had a pork dinner with a wonderful cooked purple cabbage."}
{"text":"Finally made it in to this fine establishment this past weekend. I'm really glad we did. This is my favorite type of restaurant. Lots of classic dishes mixed in with some less common choices. The dishes are obviously well planned and executed perfectly.   We started with a bottle of red wine and the goat cheese fondu. Creamy and spicy. Just the right amount as not to get over cheesed.   Next, I had the beat salad. A little smaller than I like and the beats were not the star of the dish but overall, pretty tasty.  For my entree I had the buffalo sirloin. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a delicious savory bread pudding. Great dish. I highly recommend. I had bites from around the table including the mussels, the chicken and the Mac and cheese that came with the tenderloin medallions (really tasty).  Overall, loved Rusconi's. Get pasted the fact that it's in a strip mall next to Panda Express and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends to check out their Happy Hour which runs from 4-6pm seven days a week. The HH food menu consists of  six items ranging from $1-$3 off the regular price menu.  Draft beers, wells, and house wines are all $1 (maybe $2) off. I am also supposed to mention, per my wine connoisseur friend, that the reds were served a little cold, but nothing body temperature couldn't handle.  Dave, the bartender and our server (there were only two other patrons at the bar), kept our alcoholic drinks flowing, but was a oblivious to the water refills, but hey, I understand the priorities...make that money.  Between the seven of us, we split one Kitchen Platter, Two orders of the Steamed Mussels, two orders of the Goat Cheese and Artichoke Fondue and two Pork Belly plates which satisfied any hunger, but didn't leave us feeling full.   -     The Kitchen Platter was what I was really excited for, but it ended up being pretty pathetic looking and I was relieved I was only paying HH prices for that puppy. Maybe serve it on a smaller platter next time for an optical illusion? Anyway, comes with chorizo (about 5 tiny pieces), artisan cheese (4 small slices), spiced olives, roasted peppers (which were like shoestrings that didn't even look like it totaled one quarter of a pepper), grilled artisan bread (4 slices), and a delicious pesto dip. It was good, but like I said, I wouldn't pay full price for that portion size. -     \"As far as Arizona mussels go, they are pretty good\" which accurately sums up that appetizer which comes with six mussels per order. -     The Goat Cheese Fondue was served in a cute mini staub pot and accompanied by warmed pita. The goat cheese was deliciously creamy (just as a note, the pieces of artichokes were few and far between so don't get this app solely for the 'chokes). -     The Pork Belly plate was by far my favorite dish I tried and I will recommend to anyone I know that is coming here. The combination of the pork with creamy grits and apple relish was amazing and if you don't like pork, just shove it to the side and it the grits with apple relish, seriously, very yummy. If you venture into Rusconi's you MUST try it out!  I rate it at 3.5 stars, but rounded up cause this place hasn't even been open for a week. I'm curious to try their dinner menu, which seems to be what the other reviewers are excited about.  I'm happy its in the neighborhood and I will be back to try more!  ----------- Visited a second time with a friend. I, again chose to sit in the bar area and the service was amazing! Zack made us feel like we were the only customers in there, despite the other patrons around. We started with the Pork Belly app ($6 HH price) and each had wine. I did notice the HH menu has changed, they now offer a burger for $9, the drink prices stayed the same.   For our entrees we went light by ordering salads. I had the Pulled Chicken and Strawberry Salad ($9) and my friend had the Romaine Salad. Both salads are on the smaller, starter portion side, but both were tasty. I loved the small little cubes of mozzarella cheese with mine. For two salads, two glasses of wine, and an appetizer we ran up a $42.00 bill. But we both were impressed with the food and service. Solid 4 stars this time :)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The hostess had zero iContact don't think she brushed your hair and couldn't be bothered to try and help us get seated. We ended up leaving and going across the street to Nicks with it was great service! Easiest thing to provide the restaurant is good customer service. I just don't get it"}
{"text":"Great food! The fondue appetizer is great... their salad is super fresh, they always keep your beverage full and their desserts, wow the desserts  are awesome I had three!    Super highly recommended and being a foodie I was impressed!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Rusconi's American Kitchen. We had a good experience. We started with a cheese and meat block and Martinis. The block had a few varieties of cheese and many meat choices with bread, olives, and pickled veggies. Our dinner choices consisted of the pork shank, lamb, salmon and short ribs. All fabulous options. It was a bit noisy but we will come back."}
{"text":"I don't know if the other reviewers experienced a different staff or cook but I was disappointed. My friend suggested it based on good reviews on Yelp so we met for 1130A brunch on Sunday. The restaurant was half full, and we were steered to THE VERY LAST TABLE IN THE BACK. The Antipodes.  We were dressed like humans, had no strange growths or odors emanating, and I asked my friend who is a lot more accommodating than I, apparently, if this was OK and she didn't want to fuss. They had room to accommodate us at a 4 top and squished us into the last 2 top against a wall. No grand rush came in the time we were there so I can't explain the seating.   The server was genial and made personal recommendations when asked,  I don't fault him. My friend said the coffee was good and she had a salad. I had a chile pork sandwich which had zero nuance of chile. I give them applause for the fries, they were crunchy and delicate and very good. For the price and lack of flavor, I will not return."}
{"text":"I made reservations in advance and then called to confirm and let them know it was a special occasion.  All was good, just not over the top in terms of excellent service.  The hostess did good, the server did good and the food was 3.5-4 stars.  Salmon was good but didnt have the wild caught flavor of most salmon I've personally caught.  Maybe the salmon they serve is a different species.  No worries. Still very good.  I had the tenderloin speciality prepared very nicely over a grits and feta concoction.  Excellent flavors....just not super hot when it arrived at the table.  Over all setting is nice....nothing super wow in terms of romantic, but comfortable.  Yes, I would recommend for very good food at a very fair price."}
{"text":"In town on business and was very intrigued by other reviews. I arrived later than anticipated with 30 minutes left before closing. The place had started to thin out but I was promptly greeting by a duo up front and  proceeded to the bar. Erin was the bartender that evening and gave me a run down of the beers. After reading previous rave reviews of the Medallions over mac and cheese I had to try it. The kitchen staff was on point and my food was out in no time. The beef medallions were cooked perfectly to my request and the mac was incredible. I let Erin talk me in to the chocolate bread pudding for desert with no regrets. It was a perfect cap to dinner. Excellent staff with great vibes. Loved the smell of the pecan wood burning under the grill. Thanks for a great experience see you guys next time!"}
{"text":"Good service from the 2 Bartenders Dave & Zack... The chef came out to chat with us which we always love.... Took their menu suggestions and loved everything we ordered from the mussels to the pork belly to the buffalo... Nice decor, upscale & warm, open kitchen, well done concept.... Bells beer on tap which if you are from the Midwest you will be happy to see.... We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here last night based on the Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Had the beef medallions and the sea scallops as well as the dark chocolate bread pudding.  The food was spot on.  The environment has a cozy, neighborhood hidden gem feel.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but laid out very inviting on the inside. Wait staff was awesome.  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Phoenix now!!!   We ate here last night.   When you first walk in, the wonderful aroma hits you!! It makes you crave a good meat dish from that second in. Smelt so good!  The restaurant looks like it would be small but it goes far back and is fairly big.   We started with the Parmesan truffle fries. To  die for. The flavors are perfect. And the dips are homemade and so unique. Loved it. A must-get if you go.   Then we had dinner. I had the chicken with green chile risotto and carrots. It has a limited availability so you want to get there early for dinner. The chicken was hot and melted in my mouth. The risotto was so good and I don't usually like green chile. And the carrots mmm! One of the best dishes I have had all year.   The ambiance was great. Dim lights. Slightly warm in there but it was a busy Friday night.   My boyfriend and I agreed it is in our top restaurants ever since moving to Arizona.   Loved it here. Absolutely no complaints. Can't wait to go back!!  Next time I want to try their brunch because we were told it was good.   Five stars. So fabulous."}
{"text":"What's taken me so long to write this review? We have dined here twice. The first time we stumbled upon Rusconi's was after my office Holiday party (that had horrible food). My husband and I tried a little of everything. The second time we tried different items and everything is just delicious and executed perfectly. Their mac n cheese with green chili is just amazing (under sides not starters!), the artisan cheese board is delightful, we had an amazing cauliflower soup (I believe they change due to seasonal vegetables). We don't live on the North side of town but my Mother does. This is our new go to stop in Phoenix. You've got to try it. Make a resie because it's small and always busy!"}
{"text":"After my second visit in two years I came to the realization that I need to come here more often.    The food is delicious and a very nice wine list.   I have to laugh at the reviewer who gave Rusconi's a 1 Star review because the server asked how everyone is... LOL!!!   \"One Star\" Really??  Although, I do like to read 1 Star reviews because It's funny to read what people's image of their position in the universe is    Anyway, the service is great and I do prefer that the server/bartender does check in on me to make sure that everything came out as ordered."}
{"text":"Very disapointed in Rusconi,s happy hour policies and new prices. No longer a deal at all, and when I bought my usual well scotch, the upcharged me $3 for ice. This is the biggest fraud in bar tending and inexcusable when all i got was a cupful of ice and I was told they had to add more scotch so a $6 well was now $9. I should have refused. My bad. So instead of a second round and food, we finished our drinks and left. Poor management, and waiter training. He should have come back to my table and warned me on the upcharge as many other waiters have done when they have misled the customer. Oh well, they lost business tonight and never will we be back...adios Rusconi. Bs Rusconi's you put in no more than an ounce and a half and filled up the glass to the top with ice And the complaint was that your waiter should have told me the fraud you were Attempting and I would've changed to a nice wine"}
{"text":"4 1/2* Rusconi's American Kitchen 10637 Tatum (and Shea) Phoenix Have Happy Hour and 4 course prix fixe menu Recommend: dinner on Monday nights, wines are 1/2 price Excellent wine list: had killer ZD pinot noir and the bomb Simi Valley Cabernet Delicious food  Loved the ribs Didn't like the salmon The chocolate bread pudding was tops Herbert was the best beverage server; really knows wine Super clean bathrooms"}
{"text":"Wow! Mr. Rusconi you genious! This place is quickly becoming my favorite spot in the valley. Have been there 3-4 times and have loved it everytime. The last visit, we got the pork belly appetizer to share and me and the wife got the Beef tenderloin with white truffle mac n cheese and the Lamb Chops with lamb stew (yes!, two big lamb chops in a gravy with lamb stew meat) respectively, everything was just wonderfull. The meat was cooked perfectly, the stew sauce was amazing, and the mac n cheese is heavenly (probably my fav dish here, would eat it everyday if I could :-)). Some might say that the portions are a little small, I think they are perfect, fills you up perfectly without leaving you too stuffed & I find the prices amazing too for the quality & the presentation of food they serve. Yes we'll be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Do not pass this place up because it is in a strip mall...you will regret it! The food is fantastic. We had the salmon with blackberry glaze, the roasted natural chicken, the chocolate bread pudding and the creme brûlée. The sides were delicious, especially the green chili mac and cheese.   We went on a Thursday night around dinnertime and didn't have to wait at all. When we were leaving it looked like there were quite a few people waiting for a table. It's worth it! The vibe is great, and dress can be casual or dressy. Everything is clean and all of the food tasted very fresh. A lot of people seemed to be ordering the fondue so it must be very good. Do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to check this place out but had called in too late for a reservation on Friday for 6:30pm a couple of weeks ago.  If you want to try this place on a weekend evening, make sure you plan accordingly.  The reason? This place is amazing!  We decided to come for dinner for the hubby's birthday instead.  We tried the cheese plate as well as the macaroni for our appetizers (giving the macaroni to the child which she promptly scarfed) and had two delicious dinners.  I had the buffalo steak and the hubby had roasted chicken.  Both of us cleaned our plates and to say we enjoyed our meal would be an understatement.  There were a lot of sounds coming out of me that I don't usually find myself making at restaurants. The desert was by far the best part, though.  We had the bread pudding and even after we had practically licked the plate clean we were still ravenous for more.  It was beyond delicious and I cannot wait to come back and eat it again.  The drinks were also top notch, something the hubby appreciated. This place is a must visit; often if your pocketbook can spare it."}
{"text":"Would give 6 stars if I could! Wife and I went here for dinner for our 6th wedding anniversary and everything we ate was delicious. Max was our server and did a great job providing insight to the menu and what was good. Every recommendation was great and so tasty. We will definitely be going back to try the Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Friend brought us here and we really liked it!   Food A Service A Ambiance A  Quality food at reasonable prices. Sea scallops ..... Awesome Others had chicken, steak medallion,   Hubby spilled his wine and waitress was there with another glass before we could say sorry.    We will return with new friends to share our find."}
{"text":"Great food!! absolutely delicious,  service was a touch slow but nothing to complain about.   Portions need to be a ittle bigger unless the price comes down a bit"}
{"text":"We were only in Arizona for a day, and heard this was the place to go. YES! Both the food and the atmosphere were phenomenal. Hannah was our waitress and she was nothing but pleasant. We were the last table seated before the restaurant closed to prep for dinner, and although we were the only patrons in there, she never made us feel rushed and the kitchen put just as much care into the food and presentation as I'm sure they do during \"normal\" hours. They nailed the burger - my husband was excited that he asked for it medium-rare and they actually made it medium-rare. The star of the show, as Hannah put it, was definitely the dark chocolate bread pudding - this is the dessert dreams are made of. Overall, it was just a wonderful experience. We're glad we got this taste of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Our first alert should have been when the hostess asked in a bored tone \"can I help you?\"... Yep, not very welcoming.   I said we would like a booth if available then she said they only had 'those' small high chair tables (by the door), as if she was trying to discourage us from staying.   I had seen that place for a few years but this was our first time there. The front is very small but the place is quite big. It has a nice ambiance and they seem to be very busy.   Our server was very nice and friendly but we felt quite neglected. He stopped by but did not take drinks order, we spent the night trying to get his attention and had to ask other people for drink, refill, etc. I stuck with water and hubby got a soda but getting refills was a pain. I even got my soup with no spoon and had to just stare at it for quite a while.   Hubby had the filet special, we asked our server if perhaps he should order a side if the special portion was small, but he said it was not small.  When it arrived we thought it was tiny, so as soon as we could get someone's attention we ordered a side of fingerling potatoes, which arrived not-promptly (by the end of his meal). However the cuteness factor was very high. They were served in a red tiny dish like a miniature Dutch oven. Not sure what is the name for that.   I ordered a cucumber/avocado cold soup with shrimp because I like avocado and shrimp (the one sans-spoon) and while it was OK I think it should be called cucumber/coconut, I did not taste even a hint of avocado and there was not much shrimp either.  I also had a hamburger with fries. The soup could have used some salt, and the fries were too salty. By the way, I did not see salt shakers and did not want to upset myself even more by trying to get one.   For dessert our server recommend the lemon budino and it was delicious.   Other than the soup the food was good but with the service we received this was not a good experience.  Anyone can have a bad day but we at least expect servers to acknowledge somehow when they are not meeting basic expectations."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic!  Ambience, service, wine, starters, salad, entree and dessert!!"}
{"text":"It was not that great my appetizer was luke warm and the food was nothing to brag about. The best part of the night was the people we sat next to. The ladies were celebrating many years old over 70 and they were lots of fun. The service sucks here and not worth coming again."}
{"text":"Came here by chance. Left happy. Would recommend. Chicken salad was fabulous! The atmosphere was beautiful, clean and relaxing. Great menu items. Very nice place for lunch or dinner. Great date night opportunity."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and enjoyed it very much. Obviously the menu has many choices for eggs and breakfast, but fewer for lunch. I choose the Turkey with the 9 grain bread. It was amazing.  Our service was excellent as well, very attentive,  but not all over us either. We really enjoyed it and when we come back to Scottsdale we will return to eat here again."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant as a surprise reservation for our first Valentine's Day with my boyfriend, Ryan. We waited until 4 days before to book, so it is no surprise that the first available table was at 9:00 pm. Not a problem for us. Upon our arrival, the restaurant was booming with business and quite noisy, but that is to be expected. We were seated around the corner from the kitchen where a lot of employee traffic takes place and was even louder. This only bothered me slightly because the three tables next to us were empty when we arrived and remained so throughout our visit. Our server, however, was pleasant and prompt, although I don't recall her name (blonde, young, pretty).  Ryan requested the ancho chili seared ahi tuna w/ quinoa salad, avocado and tiny tomatoes for his first course, but they ran out. This was a bummer considering we had only six options to choose from. Instead, he ordered pan roasted key west shrimp w/ green chili grits, schreiner's linguica sausage, cured tomato and corn jus, which he enjoyed. I had boneless short ribs with kabocha squash, risotto, parmesan cheese and red wine jus...delicious!  Second course, Ryan ordered garlic and herb crusted rack of lamb w/ heirloom potatoes, small green beans, fennel, cured tomato and roasted pepper tapenade. I had herbed breast of natural chicken with preserved fruit, pearl pasta, small green beans and balsamic vinegar jus. Both meals were perfectly portioned and tasted excellent.  Dessert was included as part of the three course fixed menu. Ryan had grilled apple fritters w/ salted caramel and meyer lemon curd. Although they tasted good, these fritters strongly resembled cinnamon doughnut holes and couldn't have differed much. I had white chocolate cheesecake w/ blackberries, dark chocolate and berry sauces. This dessert wasn't impressive either as far as taste, but I love cheesecake and it looked beautiful.   I would litter any restaurant w/ five stars as long as I'm out with Ryan because he has me on cloud nine! This review was meant to be informative, we had a beautiful meal and I would really like to return."}
{"text":"I think this was an average dining experience. The restaurant is quite fancy for being in a strip mall. They took reservations same day and we got right in. They were fairly busy for midweek.   Service was okay. I guess I feel if it is an expensive restaurant, the service should be better than average. The servers should not have so many tables if the bills are really high(high tip), so they can take good care of the tables they do have. But it seemed our server and all the others were running around and hard to flag down.  The food comes out on a counter with a mirror up top so you can see it. The food plates were visually appealing. I forget which salad I had but it was delicious and had unique flavors...definitely not the usual. My daughter got the kids salmon. She said well done....it came out charred! It was black, but not so black I wouldn't let her eat it. She liked it, but I would not order it like that again. I heard the black can cause cancer, so prefer food without it.  They called a few days later to thank us for visiting, I think this was nice. Random, but nice."}
{"text":"Great Place! Delicious Food!Amazing service!! Taylor was our waiter!! Put a candle in my chocolate bread pudding for my birthday!! Just awesome!! Will go again soon!!"}
{"text":"Rusconi's was rated 4.9 stars...Why?    Are FAMILY and FRIENDS rating this place?  We arrived at Rusconi's about 1:00pm..It was not busy.  After 23 minutes we were getting ready to leave a waiter/bartender came to our table to take the order.   The food was mediocre at best.  NOTE: WAITERS stop taking orders on the side of the tables with your BUTT in customers   faces.   We would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Rusconi's and we are still just as impressed. My Fiance once again had the scallops, totally enjoyed them...again, served over pureed cauliflower, which I could have sworn was whipped potatoes, yummy and healthy.  This visit I had The Tenderloin Medallions, you could practically cut them with a fork. Served over Rusconi's Mac-n-cheese with truffle oil. Also, grilled Asparagus and carrots. The veggies were done perfectly and if you are looking for a quick snack, grab the appetizer size of Mac-n-cheese, super great! It definitely is not velveeta!   Definitely make reservations. This is a bustling, busy place."}
{"text":"My brother and his wife were visiting from out of town and thought this would be a good choice that, while very popular, is still somewhat unknown even among locals who've lived in Phoenix for 25 years!  The burgers are always a good choice, and come with a generous portion of fries cooked perfectly. My brother had the salmon which was superb, and even the Brussel Sprouts were great!. We topped it off with an ice cream/sorbet trio which was divine.   The service here is consistently about perfect, and Management here is EXCELLENT. If a problem should ever arise, they understand how to resolve and take take care of the customers as few establishments do throughout the country.  I highly recommend this great, locally owned and independent restaurant."}
{"text":"My review is directed towards the restaurant owner.  I recommend that you speak with your wait staff and ESPECIALLY your general manager, Tom Brewer, in regards to what excellent customer service should look like.  I guarantee you will lose customers if you can't provide the level of service that people expect when they walk through the door.  I understand people get stressed when it's busy but that's part of working in a restaurant. I personally felt like my server couldn't care less about my dining experience. He also couldn't tell me what the cheeses were on the cheese board and the kitchen board. When I asked him he simply said \"I'm not sure\". I had to ask him to go and check, Our food was just just ok. I think by the time we got it we were so turned off by the service that we were already wishing we had picked a different place. So many places now have this type of food on their menu and provide much much better service.  I had the scallops which were great quality but unfortunately WAY over seasoned and much too salty.  You should let the scallop be the star of the show, not the salt and seasoning.  The goat cheese grits that the pork belly appetizer came on were some of the best I've had and I don't even like goat cheese.  The bread on our cheese board was meant to be toasted but was just thrown over an open flame so was burnt.  The brie cheesecake was a huge disappointment.  The best part about it is the crust which is absolutely amazing.  However, it's served crust side up which is pretty to look at but hard to eat.  We wound up flipping ours over.  I should mention this was my second time there, the night before I had come for happy hour.  I received the same lackluster service and my chocolate martini was probably the worst I've ever had.  It was WAY too strong, no chocolate flavor to speak of except the Hershey's syrup on the inside of the glass.  Now typically I'm very happy to get a drink that's on the \"stronger\" side, but this was too much.  After a couple of sips my tongue was numb and honestly it was just really hard to get down.  If I wanted pure vodka I would have ordered a vodka on the rocks.  It also had three coffee beans floating in it which again, was pretty but not well thought out since in order to drink it I had to either remove the beans or make sure I didn't swallow them.  My happy hour experience was my first time there and thought maybe the bad service was a fluke so that's why I came back the second night for dinner.  I always like to give places at least two chances.  Not to mentioned I had seen the review of your place on Check Please and was so excited to try it.     As for your general manager Tom, he is the main reason why I will not be returning.  He did not introduce himself as the general manager, just approached me by tapping me on the shoulder and told me that you guys could no longer hold my reservation and I would not be able to dine there that evening. (my dining partner was running 45 minutes behind which I understand can present a problem, but there are ways of dealing with things that don't involve being rude)  I didn't even realize who he was and had to ask \"who are you?\"  He quickly snapped back \"I'm the general manager\".  Here's the deal.. if you're the general manager then dress better than jeans and a sweater.  Also, here's a thought.. how about you be professional and put a name tag on.  Especially if you plan on walking up to people randomly and ordering them to leave.  Imagine my surprise!  I practically had to beg him to \"let\" us eat at the bar and once my date arrived there was a free table anyway so there was no need for him to even approach me in the first place.  What he should have done was come up to me 15 or 20 minutes after my reservation and ask me when my party would arrive and then from there offer solutions or options for me.  But instead he decided to catch me off guard and basically tell me to leave.  He was very rude and treated me like I didn't matter. As if my business was not important to him or your establishment.  I honestly have never been approached like that and at first I thought he was joking, trying to give me a hard time.  I even said to him \"oooh you're joking\" and began laughing.  He kept his stressed out and serious face and said \"no, I'm not.. I'm being very serious\".  It was literally unbelievable the way he spoke to me and how he handled the situation.  The only reason why I stayed is because I was meeting someone for a first date.    I really hope you will take this review into consideration, I think this place has potential but the poor attitude of the staff is holding it back in my opinion.  I won't be dining here again and have already begun spreading the word about the less than satisfactory experience I had here."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to visit.  It was either this place or a cheesesteak place. They opened for Happy hour just as we were walking up and the staff was super friendly.  Had the sliders which were recommended by Bartender Dave, who was incredible. Will most definitely be back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Loved it. Very quaint, romantic, perfect for a date night. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled across this place while doing some shopping. It seemed perfect; there was no wait, our server was polite, and it was a great atmosphere. The Mac-n-cheese was delicious, and we enjoyed our meals.   My second time around, however, was not as great. For a weeknight, it was packed. I didn't mind waiting, but the hostess was very rude and short with us. That I did mind. We got seated, and our server didn't come to our table until 15 minutes after being seated. We were ready to order by then. I ordered a side salad just to start off, and specifically asked for the dressing on the side, as well as a few ingredients (including nuts) be left out. I have a nut allergy, so it was crucial that I not have any nuts mixed in or in contact with my food. I adore the white truffle Mac-n-cheese, and ordered that as well as the scallops.   Around 30 minutes later, our server returns with just our salads, no main courses in sight. I understand you're busy, but 30 minutes for a side salad? Really? On top of that, though, my salad was drenched in dressing, and as I was picking through, I saw nuts. I specifically had asked for no nuts, and the dressing on the side. I had it sent back to the kitchen, and just asked that it be removed from my bill. I was in a foul mood by then. When we finally got our meal, my Mac-n-cheese was lukewarm, which I don't understand. I find it funny because my server actually told me, \"Careful, that dish is going to be warm.\" HA!   By the time I bit into my scallops, I was ready to just eat, pay, and get the heck out of there. Now, I am a huge fan of scallops. If I see scallops on the menu, there's a high likelihood I will order that dish. My scallops were awful. They were chewy, and I understand that they are supposed to be a little fishy, but I felt like I was eating rotten fish. The taste was overbearing, and I couldn't swallow it.   I left at that point. The manager tried to talk to me and my friends, but I was so overwhelmed with how awful it was. I will never return to this restaurant after that horrid experience. If I could, I would give no stars. Awful."}
{"text":"so happy to have a great place in my neighborhood.  Cool Ambiance Friendly Service Great Food  Definitely will be on heavy rotation for places I go"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood restaurant.  The food is fabulous and the service is typically top notch.  The staff makes every effort to insure their guests are completely satisfied.  The chef's menu choices make the dining experience memorable.  Highly recommend for any special occasion or simply a night out.  Don't forget Sunday brunch.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and glad we did! Tried the schreiner's sausage and pork belly with grits it was yummy and so were the beef medallions. Nice wine list too"}
{"text":"If you like New American Cuisine, you simply must try Rusconi's. Our party of 8 had nothing but positive things to say about the food, the service, and the atmosphere. We arrived at 5:30 and, thankfully, we had made a reservation, because even on a Monday night, it was very busy. The server was excellent, pacing the meal perfectly and keeping everyone supplied with beverages.  We sampled many dishes, from the shrimp and grits appetizer (savored every bite) to the arugula and blue cheese salad (divine) to the burger (huge and juicy) to the bread pudding (pronounced \"Perfect!) No one had anything but positive things to say about every dish. And there were so many we didn't try, I can't wait to go back. We were there to catch up as well as eat, but never did we feel rushed even though the restaurant was busy."}
{"text":"It is simply a neighborhood place that is casual.The food is average at best.the menu is not very appealing.But it does have a nice cozy bar. Service is not professional.they don't know what it Evans to refill a water glass. And no bread unless you ask for it. Not worth a 2nd time."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Service was prompt and attentive. Food was outstanding for all 6 of us. I had the goat cheese salad and the hazelnut salad as well as the Chipotle soup. Soooo tasty. I tried a bite of the short rib. Wholly Cow it was so tender with a great savory flavor. My aunt ordered a rare burger and it was rare! Which doesnt usually happen. For dessert we got the chocolate pecan pie on the house for my birthday. It was tiny but somehow it was enough for us all to split because it was so decadent. Only complaint was my margarita, it wasnt too great just alright. But when I tried their margarita on the drink menu with either jalepeno or habenero, now that was great! Very spicy though!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch & had the hamburger with a green house salad and my other half had the turkey Panini  all fresh ingredients. We splurged and split a bread pudding. WOW!   This one of the few places where you see quality control out of kitchen, and super service from the cooks who care what he produces to the server who care about customer and expectation.  Classy relaxed decor, great prices, superb quality. John our server was awesome. Cannot say enough positives about Rusconi's.   Definitely a keeper! You must try Rusconi's!! And We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but I thought slightly under seasoned. Seating is slightly crammed which I didn't care for. Service was very good and it was easy to get a reservation. Nice place for a date and prices were good."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!  I am going to go out on a limb and say this one of the top three meals I have ever eaten in my life. The food came together to make the dish out of this world. I hate carrots and ate them all!  Wow. The dish I am referencing is the beef tenderloin medallions. I am so mad I just now found this place since I live  within 10 miles. I will be coming here at least once a month from now on. Probably a lot more!"}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner while I was in town visiting... delicious. Absolutely fantastic. Every single bite of every single dish blew me away. The chef here clearly has a taste for the divine. Do not pass this place up."}
{"text":"This could have been five star review if for better service.  Came here for lunch the other day and really enjoyed my meal. I ordered grilled salmon, salmon was cooked perfectly, very moist, sauce served with salmon had a good flavor, nicely complimented the salmon.   Best part was desert. It wasn't too sweet, had just right amount of sweetness to it, I could have easily had two servings.  Nice ambiance, clean, tasteful decor, everything was great except a server. She smiled only from out of obligation. Since her service was slow, I watched her at other tables, she seemed genuinely nice to them and attentive. I felt like she purposely ignored our table, and we really had to go out of way to get her service.   So unfortunate that I liked their food but service was too slow and not so friendly."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the five or four star reviews.  We came for happy hour.  Maybe we're spoiled by the bigger cheaper drinks and amazing food at places like Postino's and other North Central Phoenix restaurants.  We only wanted an app or two, but ordered three because I had that sense we would never make it here again, so thought we should try just one more thing.  The place is pretty.  And the base ingredients seem better and fresher than many other places around Tatum & Shea, but that's why we don't eat around here much. :(  Wish we had a reason to, would be so convenient with all the grocery shopping we do around this particular intersection."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a client/friend.  We both had the roasted chicken with cavatelli pasta.  Upon first bite, I could taste goat cheese.   YIKES!!   I know I had scanned the description of the menu item.  I hadn't seen anything about goat cheese.   I was thinking about sending it back cause I CAN'T stand goat cheese!!   I gingerly took a few more bites.   I didn't taste it anymore, thank goodness.  It had a tiny bit of shredded roasted chicken.  Tasted like the roast chicken we pick up in the local grocery store.   The dish had a somewhat creamy sauce.  I don't know.   I didn't find anything about it that was especially exciting, but to top it off, afterwards I had stomach cramps, something I get when I eat food that has bacteria.  Was the chicken left out too long?  Was something old in the dish?   Would I go back?   I very strongly doubt it."}
{"text":"This is another place that I'm kicking myself for not trying sooner.  I think I need to start a \"Thanks to Lisa E.\" list because here's another spot that I discovered because of her. Truth be told, Rusconi's has been on my bookmark list for a while, but Lisa expedited my introduction to this awesome place.  True, it's in a strip mall but they've done a fantastic job with the space and the result is a classy/cozy spot to eat.  Their menu is a farm to table concept with creative entrees using fresh ingredients. They have a small bar which is a fun place to position yourself. They have a good wine selection and the friendly bartenders whip up some tasty hand-crafted cocktails.  I had the roasted sea scallops which were good sized, and served with baby cabbage in a delicious glaze.  They have some other amazing entrees....the tenderloin is on my \"to try\" list for next time. And though I don't eat lamb, I have to admit that their lamb dishes sound intriguing and delicious.  This is really a great spot for a date, or a group or family meal. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute hidden gem. Who could imagine such a fabulous restaurant would be tucked away in a strip mall. Went with a group of friends for my birthday and we were delightfully surprised! Love everything about it, food, atmosphere, service. Superb. I had the roasted sea scallops with butternut squash puree, brussels, fennel apple salad and warm bacon dressing. And as an extra treat (it was my birthday afterall), I splurged with an addition of foie gras. To...Die...For. Well, I wouldn't kill myself if I couldn't eat it, but you know what I'm saying. Cooked perfectly, exquisitely delicious. As my sister so eloquently said, thank goodness mom taught us how to eat liver and onion as kids, cause now we can really appreciate the delicacy that is foie gras. Anyways, I digress. We also shared parmesan truffle french fries and the artichoke and goat cheese fondue with artisan bread toasts. (Clearly, we girls were NOT on diets and thank goodness!) They comped me the yummilicious chocolate bread pudding for dessert for my birthday. While amazing, my only constructive feedback would be that the dessert quantity was on the small side, well tiny actually. Enough for a taste, without feeling stuffed to the gills, but would have liked more than a taste. Our server Taylor was charming and flirtatious and he made our whole table feel special. There was zero pretentiousness about the place. I can say with confidence, you would never find a jewel like this in LA! Already recommended to half a dozen people! Make reservations, cause all my friends might beat you to the best tables."}
{"text":"After a distinguished stint at Lon's at the Hermosa Inn Chef Rusconi has opened his own place at the corner of Tatum and Shea.  This is the perfect upscale neighborhood restaurant.  Good food-my roasted chicken was excellent, Good service - friendly and knowledgeable, Reasonable prices- absolutely.  Check this place out.  It's really good."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the food!  I had the chicken and pasta which was amazing! This restaurant is small but I really enjoyed it!  I saw the good reviews on TripAdvisor and here as well and I just had to try it,  I'm so glad I did!"}
{"text":"We found this wasn't the best place for kids.  We'll be back for date night!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in the area. My law partner and I were so happy when this place opened and we often walk over for lunch. The service is excellent and the food is always fresh and made to order. I highly recommend the Kitchen Burger and fries, which for around $10 is the best sit down lunch around these parts."}
{"text":"This is a fancy place with excellent service. The new menu options are very creative and we haven't been disappointed once"}
{"text":"We come here about 5-6 times a year. We normal come with friends and family. Always great food and cocktails. The service can be choppy at some times keeping me away from a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and both times the food was to die for. The kitchen board charcuterie plate is out of this world: their house-pickled veggies and homemade pesto are second to none.  Always keep an ear open for their specials! Burrata salad and asparagus soup are delish. Their cocktails tend to be on the sweeter side, but  creative and good. My hunny goes for the Fresno margarita and I've done various martinis. The steak medallions are so tender and have an incredible sear and the truffle mac is so rich. Have yet to try dessert as we've been too full but are eager to do so. The only complaint is that service does not match the food. Paige, our server tonight started our great (and was much better than the last--his name I don't recall) but after we had put our food order in she returned once, to ask us how our dinner was and deliver the bill. Food is spectacular, service needs some improvement."}
{"text":"My husband and I, looking for a new place to try, decided to give Rusconi's a try.  We are so happy we did!  The food was incredible.  We ordered from the summer menu and both tried the beef medallion and we were both delighted!  The beef was tender and both orders cooked to perfection (Mdm rare and Mdm).  The accompanying Mac and cheese and vegetables were delicious.  We plan to go back next week as there were several menu items that we wanted to try.  I think you will be pleased if you decide to try Rusconi's!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner tonight and were excited having read the reviews. In summary it was ok but nothing special, meaning that it isn't worth going back again.   We started out wanting to order the mussels appetizer but they had no mussels, it happens. We ordered the chili tomato fondu, it was uninspiring and had very little taste.  Secondly we all had the Arugula salad, very tasty but also very small.  For our main courses two of us ordered the Short Ribs while two of us ordered the glazed Pork. The short ribs came with chilli grits that were again bland, but the pork ribs were cooked perfectly. The glazed pork was very good though the portion was again not as large as I would have expected. We ended with the Brie cheesecake which I though was a little dry.  Overall an ok place but only if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I used to love this place a few years back but very disappointed today. Rude hostess that seemed bothered I asked for menu! Then go to bar and wait for menu too long. Asked for water twice and only had limited menu at 4pm but yet the regular folks next to me got their full menu at 430...I was told dinner menu not available until 5. Sorry but this place is expensive and should have impeccable service. Will take my money elsewhere like salty sow."}
{"text":"We went for dinner with a couple of friends.  They had been to the restaurant before and really enjoyed the food.    The restaurant was fairly busy and I'm not sure if they were under staffed but the service was very slow.      The food was good.   My husband and I really enjoyed the arugula and prosciutto salad to start.   We would definitely order that again.  The salad was followed by the Salmon with the blackberry glaze for me - delicious but the accompanying potatoes were undercooked.   My husband and one of our friends had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin Medallions.   The meat was good (not great) and the truffle mac and cheese on the plate was very good.   The 4th person in our group had the Scallops and those were reportedly excellent.   We also shared the Brussels Sprouts (good), and the Parmesan and white truffle scented fries (ok).   For dessert I had the Budino (yum - salted caramel pudding) and our friends tried the bread pudding which they liked."}
{"text":"This was the best dinning out meal I have had in years. We will be back often. The server was wonderful. My scallops were the best I've ever had anywhere. My wife's short ribs were unbelievable. The Chocolate bread pudding was excellent. I was amazed by the prices. When I saw the menu and the food coming out of the kitchen and the prices I assumed they must be a la carte. It was actually the price for the entire meal."}
{"text":"Four for four of us enjoyed our meals! With wine and dessert still about $50pp. Never mind strip mall location and lack of mountain view, food is the star attraction. Buffalo, beef, Pork, and scallops all were tender and prepared \"just right.\"  Birthday dessert was chocolate bread pudding and we also were tempted to lick the bowl of the budino-a cream, caramel, peach delight.   People at the next table, yes very close, admitted to returning for their second night in a row; we are likewise tempted to return tomorrow or SOON!"}
{"text":"We were in area, checked yelp and wow! Almost 300 reviews and almost a perfect score, we had to come.y wife had beef medallions, super tender and full of flavor. I had the rib eye, my favorite cut. They age their steak here, if you're into that. This one was aged for 21 days. Incredible flavor served with grilled vegetables. This place is a must repeat"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for lunch since it's near my work.  The food was very good and very fresh.  I enjoyed the lunch selection.  My salad had wonderful fresh ingredients and I felt that the size was perfect.  I would like to go back for dinner or happy hour and see what the selection is like then."}
{"text":"The ambience is that of a fine dining restaurant with the head chef in the dining room taking food from the kitchen before it is served. We ordered the charcuterie board and buttercrunch salad to start and they were both Devine. The duck was cooked perfectly and was accompanied by sweet potato gnocchi which was delish! The salmon, scallops, and roasted chicken were all equally delicious. The open kitchen shows the chefs hard at work serving delicious meals one after the next! The place was busy and the service was not so attentive. They lack leadership in the dining area but the food makes up for it. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent fine dining restaurant in PV. I've been here 4 times in all, every meal has been outstanding. The osso bucco is perfect along with the braised cabbage that accompanies it. Last night I had the short rib entrée, it was delicious. The beet and goat cheese salad was tasty. Cocktails were spot on. A great neighborhood establishment."}
{"text":"Went here totally by chance because another nearby place had a one hour wait. When we stepped in here we were told we would have over a 2 hour wait but.... if we could find space at the bar we could order dinner from there too. We looked at the bar just as two spots opened up and jumped at them.  From that point on everything was perfect. I had medallions of beef on a bed of truffle mac and cheese and my friend had a sort of savory bread pudding thing made with squash. I seldom get dessert but the Brie cheesecake sounded intriguing so we split it and it was fantastic.  Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us decide on our food/drink orders. Even though the place was full up there was none of the out of control pandemonium that sometimes occurs in places that are busy.  From a budget standpoint I would say plan on $50 person with an entree, a drink, a shared dessert and tip."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner on the patio and happy to report it lived up to all the reviews. We shared the mac 'n cheese and the burger plus a bottle of wine from their extensive wine list (solid). Only glitch was that our waiter had several tables sat one time on the patio.. (Shouldn't be a surprise - this is why we live here...). Though it took some time to get to us, he was fun, knowledgeable and passionate about the place and I can't complain. Atmosphere, service and food all excellent."}
{"text":"We found Rusconi's on Yelp and thought we'd try it and we are so glad we did.  The inside decor is very nice, clean, light and a little hip. Very comfortable and inviting. We had a starter and two entrees. The common theme was that everything served within a dish had flavors that just worked so well together. I had the beef medallions and they were amazing, the sides just pushed it over the edge. My husband had the cod special and he liked it just as much. They have a great selection of wine as well. We sat outside on the small but very comfortable patio. Our service was great. Our waiter could speak to every dish on the menu and the full wine list. We were never rushed but attended to very well. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious meal with great customer service. Try the truffle mac and cheese, it is wonderful.   Great wine list and wonderful cocktails.   I used Yelp reviews to find this place and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is great. So nice to have a great place to eat in the North Phoenix area that is not a chain of some sort. We have eaten there several times and always enjoyed. High quality ingredients prepared very nicely that accentuates the ingredients and does not take way from the ingredient. Menu has lots of options from a price point aspect which is nice.  Good wine list with many price points as well. Good happy hour too. Also did one of the wine dinners there and it was well done, perfectly paired wines with the courses.  We have experienced a bit of slow service a couple times, but we are not in a rush when I am having dinner. I would rather wait a few extra minutes to have a well prepared meal so we simply relax with our adult beverages. So unless your food took 2 hours to come out just relax and enjoy your dining companion(s)!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable cuisine, incredibly reasonable prices and remarkable service. The location is convenient in Paradise Valley...it is in a strip mall so on the outside it does not look flashy but very nice inside -- casual/classy. Loved the place. Cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"What a gem to find in the neighborhood.  Osso Bucco was perfect and just fell off the bone.  The lamb was perfectly cooked and had an amazing flavor.  The only complaint about the pork belly appetizer was that I wished there was more.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Immediately walking in you are greeted and whisked away to your seats (I sat at the bar actually bypassing the Hostess- they are super friendly though)! I have enjoyed many many items off the list. Free range chicken, medallions, over (10) wine dinner pairings and just a glass of wine. And that is where I am right now. No food. Just some wine. Enjoying a great glass of Cuvaison Chardonnay from Carneros... 2013 winery of the year... Try a glass won't you!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drink are quality. The manager that tells you, you have to leave in 20 min. For an incoming reservation, not cool. Don't sell us a new round of drinks and then snap your fingers at us. The manager ruined the good vibe. Try a restaurant with more tables or better management."}
{"text":"Everything I love and nothing I don't. Nice atmosphere -- cozy yet modern, very friendly. We got there a little early and sat at the bar. Nice selection of craft brews. San Tan Hop Shock IPA was wonderful. We started dinner with a (shared) bowl of the soup of the day; a delicious squash soup with duck confit. Oh, yes. My pork osso bucco was fall-off-the-bone-tender, the pickled cabbage and asparagus spears were a great complement, and they let me sub in corn spaetzle for the standard garlic mashed potatoes. Wifey enjoyed her squash ravioli, and our 4 friends loved their scallop and steak dishes. Shared two small plate desserts - a chocolate creme brulee and berry empanadas. Really good. Service was friendly and attentive. A perfect evening."}
{"text":"Amazing food...from the outside it could almost be fast food but once you come into this place it feels like a local, authentic, fresh restaurant which it definitely is. The food was amazing...artistic, delicious and well priced for how good the food tasted and was presented. The staff is also amazing."}
{"text":"Food is absolute delish having said that my daughter ordered the special tuna which was very fishy tasting we didn't want to complain so when the waitress came over she asked how are meal was fine but could tell she didn't eat any of it .... then the manager came over and we told him about the fish and how excellent the other meals were and she was eating part of my meal! The waitress said she would talk to the manager and when the bill came fish was on the BILL ... The food is great there policies not so great.... we happen to spend a lot of money at this restaurant and always overlook things like this ... I'm going to think twice about going again always feel like the care more about there bill than there customer!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic service and quality food. We had the short ribs (amazing taste with carrot sauce), drinks, the Buffalo sirloin and the Ravioli. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the drinks were good. The waiter was polite and the ambiance was really calm and welcoming. Really a good value."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: I've been wanting to go to Rusconi's American Kitchen for a long time!  The restaurant is simply amazing. From the moment you step inside until you walk out the door, it is an experience that rocks!  My buddy and I arrived early and made our way to the end of the bar.  The bartender was friendly and not the least bit overbearing. Wanting to just talk for a few before the remainder of our party arrived, this was the ideal spot, especially with the Monday Night Football game playing silently in the background above the back wall of the bar.  Once the rest our party of 10 arrived, we were quickly seated to our table towards the back of the establishment.  Our waiter was right on time, super friendly and very attentive.  Handling a party of 10 can be daunting but not for our guy.  He shared so much useful information from appetizer selection, to specials and what the chef is known for.  Speaking of... Chef Rusconi came out of the kitchen to say hello and he too was a joy to speak with!  It is not a big question as to why this place is so good and why it can be a little tough getting in sometimes! Pro Tip: Make reservations! THE JUICE IS WORTH THE SQUEEZE!!!  The wine special was any \"wine by the glass\" was 1/2 price by the bottle! Which was good, as our party of 10 put a little dent in their wine stock!  They carry a good selection of wines.  We ordered a couple orders of the short ribs, a meat and cheese plate and the tomato bruschetta as appetizers to start with based on our waiter's recommendation. If it would have been polite, I'm guessing someone would have licked the plates clean...  They were that good!  I ordered the seasonal green chili stew which is a small kettle pot of green chili pork and some fresh tortillas to be made into small tacos.  There was just enough for about 4 tacos, if my memory serves me correctly.  This made for a delicious starter.  I was informed by my buddy who frequents Rusconi's that the best 3 dishes on the menu are: scallops, lamb and salmon.  He ordered the salmon and was delighted with his meal.  Even though we were offered to add the scallops to any dish for a nominal price, I elected to go with the scallops as my entree.  To say I was pleased with my selection is an understatement.  The scallops rock and I look forward to returning again sooner than later to explore more of the menu items.  Not a single member of our party was less than delighter with their meal.  Everyone ranted and raved about how good and delicious the food was.  I cannot wait to come back!  This is a must try dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to give this place a higher rating. Appetizers were great! Charcuterie board and Mac N' Cheese was amazing! Sweet potato bisque was average. Dinner wasn't too impressive. Osso Bucco was tender, but nothing special. Lobster special was very bland. Needed salt and pepper. Truffle fries were a little soggy. Dessert was average as well. Bread pudding was a good try, but again nothing special. Service wasn't bad. We just didn't care for the server's style. Very short with us and forceful with his opinions...we didn't ask for any. Overall, willing to go back and try again."}
{"text":"Amazing duck and foie gras appetizer!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rusconi's is a hidden gem. Friendly, attentive staff and delicious food. I live down the street so frequent this restaurant and have never had a bad meal or experience. Best salmon I've had in AZ, hands down."}
{"text":"Super tasty! My wife and I went for a date night away from the baby and had a wonderful time. Wait staff was friendly and funny. Food was just delicious. I had the osso bucco and it melted in my mouth. Wifey had the roasted chicken with green chile mac n cheese and basically licked her plate clean. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a real jewel. Our new favorite restuarant for both lunch and dinner. We can not wait to return. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"I went for the first time this past Saturday and the entire experience was fantastic! Both hostesses welcomed me and my date. We were immediately taken to our table by the restaurant manager, nice touch. The waiter quickly came over and asked if it was our first time there, and if he could be of assistance. It was for me and we even got a waiter's assistant to serve us refreshments before we could even ask for them. Now for the important part, the food (all of it) was spectacular! From the grilled asparagus appetizer to the grilled sustainable salmon for my date and the braised beef short ribs for me. We resisted dessert and as I write this review, I sincerely regret that decision. Go as I promise you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service!  Started with two side vegetables--prickly pear braised red cabbage and roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon. Both were savory with a rich sweetness in the cabbage. A great waitress who took wonderful care with us. Hanna was perfect!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, strange location in the back of a strip mall between lower end food outlets. Even the sign (neon) is deceiving. I would classify this as an upscale but casual dining experience. Very good and informative service (thank you Reagan), food excellent, ambiance comfortable contemporary. As busy as it was, noise was low. We really enjoyed our dinners (strip steak and lamb) and the salty/caramel/custard dessert special was absolutely to die for - a discreet little concoction that arrives in a small jar. Dip in a spoon and \"oh my God\"....  I see why they made the \"best new restaurant\" list. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant and the menu was not overloaded with a bunch of crap, which made it easy to navigate and decide on what we wanted. We started with the fries, which were deliciously crisp and the brussel sprouts, which were cooked with bacon and sauteed perfectly. The Osso bucco was extremely tender and tasted great. The cabbage stood out as it was braised with prickly pear. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The wood burning cooking method really pays off at Rusconi...definitely worth a try. This was a quality and solid dining experience."}
{"text":"We had the prix fixed menu and a burger. It was delicious! The best part was the chocolate bread pudding. I would add a scoop of icecream. No drinks, but martini menu looks really great too."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken with Mac was to die for the first lunch visit. I love the ambiance and the service is perfection!  However, we came back for happy hour and a very grumpy hostesses was so rigid on where we could sit! Even if we wanted to eat"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem here in Scottsdale. We come her often because the food is amazing and very fresh.  We went on a Sunday evening and they had a great special of wine 1/2 price for the bottle. The goat cheese soufflé and squash purée was great and very filling. My hubs had the pork medallions and he said they were the best he's ever tasted.  Out server \"fritz\" was so good he made sure we were taken care is as all his tables were too. He was very informative and knew his stuff. We will always come back."}
{"text":"Our choice for restaurant week was Rusconi's and it was a fine choice! The service was awesome- our server was funny, attentive and made great recommendations.   The menu included a glass of wine. However, I am not able to drink alcohol so he was able to get the bartender to make a non-alcoholic berry drink that is similar to a mojito. It was wonderful!   First course: pan roasted gulf shrimp and linguica. It was so good! The green chili risotto and corn was a great touch with the shrimp.   Second course: pecan wood grilled flat iron steak. Again, the flavor was amazing and I appreciated the goat cheese dumplings and spaghetti squash.   Third course: hazelnut eclair. This is where the food fell short and why I deduct one star. The dessert was bland and tasted like it came from a grocery store. I would not recommend.   Overall, I am glad I came to dine at Rusconi's. I plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by the owner expressing his concern from my visit and offering a sincere response. Thank you, we've always enjoyed the food and will be back soon for another visit."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden treasures that I've found in Phoenix.  Truly a neighborhood vibe and a very nice break from the downtown Scottsdale crowd.  The scallops and short rib that we had were to die for.  I've been here twice now and the service is always amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My sister's family is visiting for the holidays so she made me in charge of picking the restaurant, so glad I found this one on Yelp!  I started with the pork belly appetizer and they had the Kitchen Board.  They were both wonderful! The server was engaging my 7 year old niece while we enjoyed the appetizers and cocktails.  My sister and her husband split the mussels and I had the beef tenderloins with the intention of bringing some home....nope!  I ate every last bit!  We finished with the warm bread pudding and it was to die for!  Fantastic food, wonderful service and a great experience.  I told my sister that was one of the best meals I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service equals five stars, it's that simple. We like the Saturday happy hour and attention to detail."}
{"text":"4 of us went there for supper for the first time and found it to be outstanding! Food was fantastic and our server Brian was very professional and efficient . Overall, a great choice to have supper- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this little place the morning after Christmas and it was seriously amazing!! The menu is scrumptious, the service is awesome, and the food is out of this world yummy in my tummy!! I had the American Omelette, with fresh, cherry tomatoes and creamy goat cheese along with a side of crispy, fingerling potatoes... Delicious!!! And on Sunday's they offer $4 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas...How can you go wrong?? My only pointers would be that the hostess could use some engagement training AND I would make sure to have that fireplace fired up and toasty BEFORE you open on these chilly wintery mornings!! But... Just a great little place with an excellent flavorful menu!! And a handsome host to boot!! We'll go back and often!!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. I had the chili Verde and my wife had the burger. She said it was one of the best she has had. My pork chili Verde was excellent. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I went here twice in one week and will be excited to return !  The menu is diverse and creative, a little something for everyone's tastes. There is much to be appreciated here - try everything.   For extra fun, sneak in at happy hour for fondue, salad, sliders, martinis, and more !!  There was a nice diverse group of smiling faces the day I was there.   They wrap it all up in a nice bow with great service. It's a warm and inviting group of servers, highly trained - but not stuffy. They all seem to enjoy themselves.  I would be too if I were serving the plates that are created here."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant that serves fresh seafood, handcrafted ice cream, overall great food and fantastic service. Will be back again."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants.  The quality is excellent, while the prices are very reasonable:  one of the best values in town.   Plenty of delicious, creative main courses in the $15-25 range.  The portions are just right, not ridiculously large or small.  Wine prices are reasonable, and some nights get the whole bottle for half price.  Pretty much everything we have tried here is excellent, and we've been here around 6x and tried a range of dishes.  Friendly servers, very nice atmosphere.  Ex-Lon's chef--one of our other favorite restaurants.  The kind of quality, atmosphere and pricing that one wants to go to and yet can afford to go to frequently."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I have been there several times and always impressed with the food. The truffle mac and cheese is delicious! One of my favorite spots close to home."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall place in a strip mall, but we loved it!  Such a cute place, great staff, good food!"}
{"text":"All stars because it's all good. Atmosphere, service, presentation and taste were all above expectation. Three different dishes ordered and all were superb ."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Portions run small so be sure to get an appetizer if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent from start to finish. Excellent service, beautifully plated and great taste. Even had to have dessert to make sure it would be a great finish.  Will be back. Great find!  Hands down best restaurant in the area. Went tonight for happy hour. Just another reason to love this place. Great HH prices. Good fondue, excellent short rib sliders. Service as usual was great."}
{"text":"A definite try in Arizona, if you're even 30 minutes away.  (The bread pudding is honestly worth  a 2 hour drive).  This place is just solid.  You can have their high end dining dishes or just have their lower budget meals.  This place is just amazing and their service treats you like the family members that like you.  Stop reading this review, make a reservation now!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for my husband's birthday... all of us greatly enjoyed it! Now it's one of my favorite spots here in Phoenix... try anything from the grill, absolutely amazing. The beef tenderloin over truffle mac n cheese was absolutely wonderful. Try the chocolate bread pudding... to die for! One of the best things about this place though is the staff; we felt so welcomed and it seemed to me that the employees genuinely felt happy to be there. It's clear they take pride in the establishment they work for, which says a lot in itself. We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"We went to Rusconis for restaurant week.  We ordered 3 dishes, none of them were memorable, in fact, the presentation was sloppy & the bar tender was our waiter... Needless to say, the dismal service was on par with the dismal food... Ugh"}
{"text":"Why the downgrade?  It has nothing to do with either the quality of the food changing or the specials.    It's the service at the bar.  There were only a half dozen of us seated, yet we could not get our bartender to make eye contact when we were ready for our bill, even when out of desperation I finally went and stood in front of him and the register hoping to pay our bill.   I  asked for the hostess to see if we could pay our bill with someone else, and no we couldn't.  Finally, I just estimated what the bill was and left cash; something I felt awkward doing but there seemed to be no other choice.  And I blame myself, because it had been a while since I have been there and I had forgotten that the happy hour bartender is just consistently this way.  (No issues with the lunch bartender/waiter.)  Good thing Salty Sow is just up the street."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have this restaurant in the neighborhood!  We ate there for the first time last night, and we will definitely be back!  LOVED the green chili grits.  I thought they had a nice selection of wine that were fairly priced.  Not only is the food amazing but the restaurant is beautiful!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Came here with my girlfriend to meet her Aunt for dinner.  She said it was good, but that was an understatement.  From the appetizers to the dessert, every bite left my mouth watering for more.  They had a special pork belly appetizer over grits.  The pork belly was so tender and flavorful and the grits were the perfect texture!    For my main, I had the beef medallion over truffle mac and cheese.  Words can't describe.  Medallion was cooked to order, seasoned just right and the truffle mac and cheese was cheesy and not over powered with truffle.  If you need a place, this is it!"}
{"text":"I am just visiting AZ for the week- made reservations at Rusconi's based on Trip Advisor and Yelp reviews alone. Great service and atmosphere. Ordered the Caramelized peartini and the kitchen board to start- both very good. For dinner me and my boyfriend both got the grilled beef medallions w/ while truffle Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese is a MUST. It is beyond delicious. For dessert we got the dark chocolate bread pudding and it was gone in about 10 seconds... So good. Would definitely recommend and come back"}
{"text":"Woah, where did this place come from? From the ambiance, to the service, the gourmet food, ... everything is simply divine!  My friend and I split the pork belly and sausage appetizer, which was fantastic. He  then had the squash soup and I had the blue cheese salad. Both were perfectly executed.  For the entree, he had steak and I had the tenderloin. Both were mouth wateringly delicious.  For dessert, we shared the pudding. It was some of the most amazing pudding I've ever had in my life.  Yes, this place is in a strip mall. But no, it doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall when you walk in. And no, once you sit down, you feel as if you've been transported to an uptown gastropub.  The only negative thing I can say was that service was a bit slow. Our server had a ton of tables, so maybe a server called in sick or something. But we still were treated well, even if we had to wait a little longer than we though we should.  I bookmarked this place and will not only be back, but I'll bring friends with me. This place is a gourmet gem not to be overlooked!"}
{"text":"Great food, very nice and prompt service, cool atmosphere. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and I am so glad I could experience it. Every mouthful was outstanding. I wish I could go back tomorrow. I will definitely make it a point to go back when I return to Phoenix.  Every dish was superb and created with quality products."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever! I use to get the beef tenderloin medallions every single time I went because they were perfectly cooked, the sauce is amazing, the carrots and Mac and cheese were to die for! I recently went vegetarian about 8 months ago- I thought I'd never go back to Rusconis!   On Valentine's Day we went and thought we'd be stuff with a salad- the waiter told us that we should try the vegetable bread pudding which I wasn't super excited about.   OH MG GOD I loved it! So delicious! The goat cheese inside was perfect and so yummy! I crave it all the time and we go at least twice a month to get it!"}
{"text":"We gave this restaurant another try..we arrived at the bar at 5:15 and waited for over 10 minutes to just get our order in for a cocktail. So we left. Too many great options in Scottsdale to continue to waste our time here."}
{"text":"The highest level of excellence all around. The service was great, ambiance made for the stars and the food was above and beyond the call of duty. First of all, no wait time as we were seated immediately. Waiter was professional and greeted us with enthusiasm. After reviewing the specials for the day, he answered all of our questions  related to a very detailed menu. Kudos as it was a one pager with a variety of food selections. I ordered the roasted chicken on a bed of lightly chili  macaroni and cheese served with roasted seasoned potatoes. Scrupulous!!! For desert I had the baked bread puddling with berries and strawberries mixed in with a special tasty sauce. ...When I searched for the top 10 restaurants in Phoenix, they came up as #2. Five Stars ."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here and just finished my food. It was absolutely amazing! I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions with truffle scented mac and cheese and green beans. It's the BEST steak I ever had! It was happiness in my mouth and oh so mouth watering good! Everything went together so well and the service was great! It was a bit busy for a Tuesday night, but the wait was well worth it. My husband ordered the kitchen burger and was quite happy with his food as well. Ambience is very nice as well. I am definitely coming back again! They also have a good selection of food for the kids as well. It gets tiring just feeding your kid the usual, chicken fingers/hotdogs/quesadilla choices. Kids can choose short ribs, beef tenderloin, grilled salmon, mac n cheese, chicken fingers or mini burgers and fries. They do have a seasonal menu so not everything you see on yelp will always be available."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for Sunday brunch with my husband.  We both had the chef's eggs Benedict with grits and it was really good.  Their grits are amazing.  We didn't have a reservation so we had to sit outside and it was a little too hot.  It is AZ after all.  There were a few servers serving our table which was a little confusing.  They didn't have any organic or freshly squeezed juices, not even orange juice. In the end, we will probably come back to try their grits again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at Rusconi's one other time before with friends, but we decided to go again on our own to give it a try. When we arrived, we had to wait for our table so we sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice, but it was from there our experience went down hill. When we were seated, we did not see our waiter for about ten minutes even though the table beside was his also. He checked on them repeatedly and did not even acknowledge us. After he finally did come to the table, he seemed rushed and inattentive. We ordered the cold cut board and that came about twenty minutes later??? After an average glass of wine and no refills on our drinks, we decided to call it quits. Overall, bad experience, so so food, less than average service and we will not be going back. But, the bartender was nice...."}
{"text":"Pretty nice little place that's kind of hidden in a strip mall. I thought the service was exceptional, and the food was pretty damn tasty. The menu was pretty interesting, I actually had a hard time settling on what to order (which is rare for me). Everything sounded tasty.  The green chile mac was the star of my dish, but the roasted chicken was moist and well seasoned as well. And OMG on the chocolate bread pudding. I'll be craving that in a few days."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I work nearby so I am eating down the menu. I have tried three of the sandwich's and all were very good.   Staff are professional and super friendly. Today, I accidentally left my wallet/phone behind. One of the staff members was very kind to run out into the parking lot while I was pulling away to make sure I got it back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a clean, modern and upbeat atmosphere, Rusconi's will knock your socks off.  What a great restaurant!  The staff goes above and beyond, the the appetizers (spicy peach goat cheese fondue) and drinks (spicy bloody with green chili vodka) blew us away and the rotating entrée menu was unreal.  We have lived in Phoenix/Scottsdale for 4 years now, been to a ton of restaurants and Rusconi's is in our Top 5.  Great all-around restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. The Chef (owner) delivered our meal and welcomed us. Short Ribs are to die for and   pisole at lunch best I've tasted"}
{"text":"Mouthgasm?! Is how I can describe the food. I had the tasting menu which included: Arizona tomatoes with buratta, grilled salmon with blackberry sauce, pecan wood grilled tenderloin medallion and coffee Gelato with biscotti for $40. The staff are very attentive and the ambience is rustic chic. Great for a date night.  Definitely will come here again if I was not from NJ."}
{"text":"Tough review to write. I wanted to like it so badly, but in the end, it was just OK. We were passing through town and had just one dinner to spend in Phoenix, we read tons of reviews on Yelp and finally decided that for our one meal, we wanted Rusconi's. Unfortunately, we left feeling like we made the wrong choice.   First off, the ambiance of the place is awesome. Really cool decor and feel all around. After being seated we were informed that three dishes were sold out. Not a huge problem. I would always prefer that something fresh is out, than something frozen is always in. About 25 minutes later the waiter returns as informs us one of the entrees we chose is also gone, and we need to select a new one. This is one of the most frustrating experiences possible in a restaurant, especially so long after ordering. 10-15 minutes later our appetizer arrives. This may be personal preference, but 35-40 minutes is too long to wait for an appetizer, it felt VERY long.   For the app we had the Pork Belly and \"Sausage\" which included one tiny dime-sized  piece of sausage. It was delicious, and I wished there were more of it. The polenta, and apple relish were great as well. But the Pork Belly was just so so. I have had better many other places. It is slow roasted, so I expected it to be juicy and tender, but it was tough and seriously lacked flavor.   25 minutes later our mains were served. Again, I feel over an hour is simply too long. The timing of the whole meal was just off. For mains we had a Beef tenderloin (very delicious) with the white truffle mac & cheese (awesome) and the Pork Osso Bucco which was very average. It was super tender, but just no flavor. It was like it was cooked sans any seasoning whatsoever. The braised cabbage was the best thing on the plate.   In the end it was over $60 with tip (no drinks). It felt very overpriced for the experience we had. I can get much more, for much less elsewhere. We walked into Rusconi's wanting (and expecting) to be wowed. But in the end, we just left disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in here for dinner tonight and will definitely be back!  First off, looks can be deceiving!  When we pulled up we thought it looked pretty small and casual but inside was much bigger and not too casual but not too fancy that I felt out of place.  Our server was Bobby and he was superb!  Great personality, friendly, helpful and on top of everything!    I ordered the tenderloin medallions with truffle Mac n cheese and carrots/green beans.  Melt in your mouth good!  Even though I was full after half I finished it off because it was so yummy I didn't want to waste it.  My daughter got the cheeseburger and mashed potatoes and those were very good as well.  Had the chocolate bread pudding and some Italian custard thing for dessert.  Everything was freaking phenomenal!  Seriously.... Sooo good!    The drinks were interesting... The pear martini was very good but there was a special martini that Bobby made us.  It had Red Stag, pineapple juice, grenadine and smoke.  I've never had a smoke drink before but it was such a cool touch plus it tasted amazing!    Wish I lived closer but I will definitely make the trip up to Scottsdale occasionally for this treat!"}
{"text":"No lemonade here...that's odd. I expected this place to have lemonade.  Came here with a bunch of friends after church. Very nice and friendly service. They were quick and got all our orders out quickly and efficiently.  Not my first choice for this cuisine, but had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had such a great dinner here last night.  I is a hidden gem. Don't let the signage fool you (it does not seem to match the sophisticated, chic interior). This place is delicious and the atmosphere is terrific. We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"We've been going here since the day it opened - literally. We've eaten almost everything on the menu and it's all Great! Michael is a great chef. Their mac and cheese is to die for. Get the steak dish - my favorite. Wine reduction sauce, mac & cheese and asparagus. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Rusconi's has a very unique and appetizing menu, and friendly accommodating service. I have only been once but I'm definitely set on coming back and enjoying another tasty dinner. I had the scallops with a vanilla scented cauliflower puree, steamed Brussels and truffle fries. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because there was nothing special or over the top, but will definitely come back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"A gem located in a cozy spot in a mall on the northeast corner of Shea and Tatum.  Service:  excellent!  Menu:  fresh and tasty offerings!  This summer, try the cooling cucumber soup...YUM!"}
{"text":"Simply put, I loved everything about this place.  My family and I randomly stumbled across this place after a day of hiking and didn't really know what to expect. Despite our underdressed appearance, there was zero snobbery from the staff and only welcoming smiles, jokes, and many laughs (may have been wine-induced).   Sundays are 1/2 off bottles of wine so obviously we got one. It's the proper post-hike hydration right? We started with the kitchen board which was a charcuterie with a hearty portion of meats and pickled veggies. The fat kid in me wanted a little more cheese though. Our entrees were the duck, the steamed mussels, and the beef tenderloin medallions. All three were delicious, fresh, and gone in 10 min flat.   Next was dessert - do yourself a favor and get the dark chocolate bread pudding. Our waiter said \"it's so good you'll want to fly back from Sacramento to eat it again tomorrow\" and it's true. I'm still thinking about it. And this meal was 2 weeks ago. It's that good."}
{"text":"Last night, four of us had a fabulous dinner.  The staff were friendly and attentive. Even the chef visited our table to make sure we enjoyed our meal.   Food was delicious and prompt.   I had the Butternut squash ravioli which was wonderful.  My friends had sea bass and salmon and there was no food left in the table.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited Rusconi's last night because of all the great yelp reviews.  Upon our arrival I was a little taken back that a great restaurant could be planted right in the middle of a Panda Express and Corleones.  After I walked through the door I ditched my first impression.   The restaurant was very busy but they quickly got us a table.  We were promptly and cheerfully greeted by our server Tommy.  He was a lot of fun and gave us some great suggestions that we took him up on.   We shared the Kitchen Burger and the Osso Bucco.  Neither disappointed.  The Kitchen Burger had a great fresh taste.  We ordered it with the fries and the lemon aioli that it came with was amazing.  The Osso Bucco was to die for and it was paired nicely with asparagus, whipped mashed potatoes and this delicious prickly pair cabbage.  Tommy checked on us several times throughout the meal and was extremely friendly each time.  Unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert but I plan on coming back for that because everything sounded amazing!"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese is amazing and they have a couple sandwiches that are really tasty. There's a short rib sandwich and some kind of pork sandwich that I would recommend. The service isn't the best I've ever had but honestly the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"It was ok I think we expected more after reading the reviews. Everything was fresh ingredients but we came in at almost closing (not knowing so just before 2pm) and the waitress didn't seem to happy about that and our fries were cold. They didn't have to seat us-we didn't even know it was closing until after we were at a table and she commented about it. So it wasn't bad-but it wasn't great. Service was timely. Good flavor on fries. Put onion on when we asked for it without. And can't really do a lettuce wrap more of a lettuce sandwich. If we were locals we may try it one more time when they weren't closing. But not 100% on that."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Had the beef medallions and my wife had some sort of glazes salmon. I liked mine better but both were amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fun, professional service staff and an excellent evening. We were a party of 14 people and EVERY person raved about their dinner - from salad through dessert (and wine). Thank you Michael Rusconi for such a great night."}
{"text":"Holy moley, this place is fantastic!  My mother and I went here after a really hard day. We were depressed, and a little down. Starting with fantastic appetizer (some sort of beef dish with vanilla potatoes), our mood improved. I capped it off with this fantastic pork dish, coupled with sweet potato risotto. By the time I was considering dessert (I declined, too full), my earlier foul mood was all but gone!  With fantastic service and a wine list I definitely want to go back and explore further, this counts as one of the best dining experiences I've had to date. The menu is gorgeous, and I wish I could have tried everything.  Nothing improves a bad day like stick-to-your-ribs New American food, fresh and warm from the kitchen. I'm definitely going back here.  Edit: Figured I'd elaborate more now that I've been there more than once.  Me and the fiancee decided to get dressed up all fancy and go out on the town for Valentine's Day. First stop? Here, for a $50 prixe fixe 3-course meal. Let's just say it was the most I've ever committed to spend on food without even knowing the menu, so I was worried that I would regret it.  Oh heck no. I did not regret it. They made it a Valentine's Day to remember!  My pork tenderloin was creamier than the freshest buttermilk, her steak perfectly cooked exactly to order (medium rare, of course, we're not heathens). The risotto was so decadent that I felt like I was committing a cardinal sin every time I took a bite. But it all paled in comparison to the dessert: this custard passionfruit thing served in a mason jar that was pretty much the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I could write an ode to that dessert. For a second, even my breathtakingly lovely fiancee paled in comparison to the beauty of it.  If I lived closer and could dedicate more money to our eating out budget, I'd be here every single day, eating the delicious food for the rest of my life, and never get sick of it. Chef Rusconi is more than just some chef or a cook, he's really an artist. This is the kind of food I expect to pay an arm and a leg for. If this place was a museum, it would be the MET. Nothing here is short of a work of art.  I'm a bit obsessed with this place. But hey, it can be hard to please my little foodie heart, and this place definitely makes the cut."}
{"text":"It's good to be back! We haven't been here since our first anniversary four years ago and we were just blown away yet again! The service, food, and ambience are impeccable. We had beef tenderloins paired with mac and cheese that's out of this world,  and the tastiest burger, cooked to perfection. Crème brûlée for dessert was the perfect ending to our meal. Also, if you're fan of iced tea, you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to return and make new memories at Rusconi's."}
{"text":"Brooke the  hostess so rude!!! Never going back!!! The waiter was outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with our brunch this morning. First of all our server was very nice as were the rest of the support staff but service was SO SLOW. We were ready to order food when she asked what we wanted to drink but instead of getting our food order too she went inside to get the drinks.... Which was fine except we were all super hungry and put our menus aside so she knew we were ready.  The coffee was good and $4 mimosas/bloodys. So we were content. But then we waited..... And waited and waited some more. It was 40 minutes from when we ordered until we got our food. And then, it wasn't hot. It wasn't cold either but breakfast should be hot, not Luke warm and not when it took 40 minutes to prepare. I think what bothered me the most is that it was not busy what so ever and after 30 minutes of waiting and explanation or apology would really have been nice. We were starving by that point so we all devoured the food, which was actually delicious. But again, not hot. If it was hot I would be on here giving this place 5 stars instead of 3. Pretty underwhelming experience over all."}
{"text":"Holy Happy Hour, Batman! 2 melt in your mouth sliders with smoked Gouda, a side salad & a beer @ just under $10. I'll be back & I'm bringing my friends.!  Staff is good, regular @ the bar with his paper is friendly & fun. 2/4 beers on tap are local."}
{"text":"First time ever visiting this restaurant. We went based on word of mouth/Yelp reviews. We were excited to check it out. We showed up and sat at the bar for brunch. The bartender greeted us and asked for drink orders. We ordered a couple drinks. She made one and forgot the other for 15 minutes. Didn't remember until after I reminded her. She ran around frazzled, making drink orders, seeming flustered, empty drink dishes all around the bar. Didn't seem like she could handle much under pressure. Food came out and was mediocre. Small dish portions and not very satisfactory. Bartender never asked if we needed anything else. She then proceeded to \"check in\" a while later and said she would grab more water for us. That never happened, as again, she got overwhelmed by drink orders/other tables she was waiting on. We then wanted to check out, which took her another 10 minutes to get our check. She got caught up in being overwhelmed AGAIN. Honestly, I'm not one to complain, but this was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Either there needed to be better staffing, or a bartender that could juggle more balls in the air. They say you only get one first impression. Mine wasn't good and unfortunately I will not recommend this restaurant or be back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how great this restaurant is... Service is impeccable  Food amazing  Ambiance is great  My only regret is that it too us so long to visit"}
{"text":"Rusconi's was a great find! We had a large group and Michael Rusconi, the owner/executive chef, was very accommodating. Everything our group ordered was delicious and the service was outstanding. Hannah was our waitress, and she was very friendly and overall made our experience very enjoyable. Will be back again! One of Phoenix's finest restaurants."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and more yum! We ate outside on a lovely evening. Started off with the pork belly (not to be missed) and the artichoke/goat cheese dip. Great starters! There we three of us: my husband had the skirt steak with to-die-for truffle mac n cheese, I had the pork osso bucco, our friend had the \"Kitchen\" burger. Note: Skip the burger and go for the other stuff.  Ignore the fact that their wood door makes the place look like it's closed and under construction (and the hostesses will tell you that they hear that multiple times every night). Once you get inside, the decor is hip and comfortable.  We will definitely be back! (I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the burger and the door!)"}
{"text":"Great date place with a cozy ambiance not to mention a kind french waiter with a sexy accent. I order a nicely cut salmon cooked to a warm medium rare temperature. It was accompany with perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes and fresh Brussels Sprouts. I definitely would go back to try their other fine dishes."}
{"text":"Okay, so I wasn't super impressed, because even though I gave it 4 stars, the food I had was lackluster.  The ambiance is great, the service was great, I wish there was a TEENSY bit more wiggle room between certain tables, but that can be forgiven.   My blasphemous move was ordering the burger. It was good, but my friend ordered the Osso Bucco, and I will regret not ordering it until I go back.  *Damn*"}
{"text":"Fritz you are a peach!  The food shines all on its own, server made our experience over the top!  Sunday brunch was our intro to Rusconi's and it did not disappoint.  I have been trying to get my husband to try this restaurant since it opened, alas my persistence has paid off!  My daughter also acquiesced to my pleas,  they both were surprised, delighted, and newly convinced that Rusconi's is all it was Yelped up to be! My daughter commented on how good they made simple scrambled eggs and bacon taste amazing, I personally loved the creamy, gourmet grits.  They took comfort food to new heights for me!  The vibe was great, approachable and pleasant staff, brunch prices were very reasonable.  We will definitely give dinner a go, want that double chocolate bread pudding desparately!"}
{"text":"Rusconi's American Kitchen is in a plaza stuck between a Panda Express and Corleones.... That's like putting a Porsche between a Ford Escort and a Dodge Neon. There's nothing wrong with either of those cars but... they're just not at the same level.   The thing I like most about Rusconi's is that it has a hip, urban, modern vibe without being pretentious.   We came in on this day to check out the Restaurant Week offerings. Our server John, a really cool, friendly guy got us our drinks and we were off to the races.  I started with the Pan Roasted Gulf Shrimp and Yellow Polenta. Perfectly cooked shrimp, corn, bacon, delicious polenta. Score!   My main course was the Braised Beef Short Ribs with Roasted Garlic and Herb Spaetzle. I don't even know what a spaetzle is, but this dish was divine. The braised rib was melt in your mouth tender... and it was meat, which I love. The sherry jus that it's bedded in is so good too, great flavor. Everything worked together nicely.  Finally, my favorite part of any meal. Dessert. I went with the White Chocolate Budino. Yup, I have no idea what a budino is either, but again... home run. It tasted like a fancy pudding but with more consistency than pudding. Then there's the caramel and pecans which add to the texture and sweet goodness.  Side note: The Chocolate Bread Pudding was awesome too, even though I only got one bite...   Best Meal I've had in Phoenix to date. The service was on point from beginning to end as well. Each course was well timed (an art) and our glasses were always full.   If you haven't been here, I highly recommend this unassuming gem. Now excuse me while I go Google Spaetzle and Budino."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Rusconi's last week and really enjoyed our date night.  The food was excellent!  We ordered the Kitchen Board which was so good.  For our entrees, husband got the Buffalo steak and I ordered the roasted chicken salad.  This was my husbands first time trying buffalo and he loved it.  I really enjoyed my salad; the chicken was very delicious.  Our server was so attentive as was the rest of the staff.  Rusconi's is a charming restaurant and if you are thinking of trying it, just do it!  It's a gem!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot in phx. Hands down!! Pretty sure I want my last meal to be the beef medallions entree. The roasted veggies and Mac and cheese are what dreams are made of -- and those medallions... straight heaven."}
{"text":"The desert menu is amazing. Hard to get a table during busy times but sometimes we just come for the sweets. Host stand is crowded and they lack the space to give an intimate experience but overall great service and food."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased with both the service and the food. I had a white truffle mac and cheese as an appetizer that I can't say enough of.  The flavor were terrific.  I could have eaten a whole meal of it but was glad I didn't.  The scallop dish was perfect, too. Three large sea scallops seared perfectly on a bed of speatzle and spinach. I also tried the creme brulee for dessert which was also fantastic. ...and to think this restaurant is walking distance from my home.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We joined another couple here for dinner - all of our meals were top notch!  Plus the dark chocolate bread pudding is fabulous!  Our meals were the Roasted Chicken Salad, Short Ribs, and the Grilled Salmon with Blackberry Glaze.  All were beautifully prepared & served!  Of course, we all had to have a taste of the dark chocolate bread pudding!  Rusconi's will now be on my list of favorites while in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I like this place despite its location in a strip mall. The food is really quite good and the drink list even better. It had a good atmosphere and our service was very good. We had a server that was a bit eccentric, yet very friendly and knowledgable.  He had us laughing and awaiting his return because he was so entertaining."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday also and although they aren't set up for that sort of thing they brought out a treat just before the check which was very cool. The menu is unique and we all had great meals but one of the particular people in our group needed to have tartar with her salmon so she snagged the first guy to walk by and it turned out to be the owner and chef who said without hesitation he would make her some. It was like gourmet tartar sauce. There was some other special request by Ms. Particular so she went to thank him after and he came over to the table and chatted. The place is awesome and great for a special occasion or an upscale lunch."}
{"text":"Just a great addition to the hood!!  I have been to Chef Rusconi's eatery on several occasions and have never been disappointed with the food or the service.  Since I am an \"industry insider\" I like to just sit at the bar and watch the show.    My wife and I stopped in just after the Christmas Holiday.  Of course we sat at the bar and ordered some apps and cocktails. The Foie with the savory donut was the bomb!  Pork Belly was great also.  Met  a couple seated next us and spent the evening swapping plates.  Was just a great memorable evening!  We have since made plans with the couple to have dinner there again!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with friends for my husbands birthday. It was wonderful. Atmosphere, food (you must order the goat cheese and artichoke dip).  The drinks were inventive and delicious and all of our meals were tasty. We will definitely be going back. Maybe this weekend for brunch or happy hour. Thank you Rusconi's for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start? Everything was perfect. The service was great and the food was even better!! We started with the Kitchen Board and the truffle fries. Kitchen board came with different cheeses and meats. For the main courses, we ordered the salmon and the filet (which was not on the menu.) the waiter will inform you of items that are not on the menu. Mainly the specials. We wiped off everything from the plates. Perfect portions and good quality food."}
{"text":"Locally owned, creative twist on American food, top quality, and attentive staff who are happy to be there."}
{"text":"Incredible, fresh, high-end feeling food in a comfortable, classy setting.  We've been here a few times and have never been disappointed.  They always have a seasonal salad special.  The current one is a tomato, burrata and micro green with balsamic and a watermelon sorbet.  Absolutely outstanding.  Perfectly ripe tomatoes, well-balanced plate.  Fantastic.  For entrees, I had the rack of lamb special with pea risotto and carrots while my dining partner had the pork osso bucco, an on-menu item with spaetzel, prickly pear purple cabbage and asparagus.  Each entree was perfectly cooked and excellent.  The only waiters were classy, the full meal was served promptly and was clearly made fresh, and we had a great time.  Solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this restaurant based on what it's aiming to be: a highish-end foodie destination.  I'm always nervous to try out new places at this price point, so whenever we are lucky enough to get a dinner out on our employers' dime, I get a little more willing to experiment outside my tried and true options.  Like many others that have reviewed this restaurant I was excited to have this addition to our neighborhood, however this place was a big disappointment.  Ambience and servers were nice, which is keeping this place from coming in at 2 stars.  Our waiter suggested a bottle of wine that I didn't like much at all, drinkable but not at all memorable.    We started with the charcuterie plate and the truffled mac & cheese (at our waiter's recommendation).  I get much better charcuterie at a place like Windsor and I found the mac & cheese to be plain gross.  In fact, I think most everyone at our table didn't like it as we didn't even finish the small little dish that was served (but as I said it was a business dinner so no one said much out loud).     The salad course was the best part of dinner- I thought my arugula, beets, goat cheese (ordinary) with fennel and mango (inventive!) was extremely tasty.  Others at the table appeared to like their salads as well.   I ordered the scallops at the server's recommendation.  The scallops themselves were the best thing on the plate (nicely cooked, perfectly salted), but nothing else on the plate was very good.  The spaetzle tasted like plain noodles, and there was some spicy red sauce drizzled around the plate that could have been Sriracha sauce (and yes, there is a time and place where Sriracha sauce is a delicious addition, but this was not it).  No one else at the table said much about their entrees positive or negative (which included Osso Bucco and the Buffalo).  Finally, desserts were boring.  Maybe we should have ordered the house made ice cream, but we opted for the bread pudding (which they were out of) and the creme brulee.  We got a pot of some other type of pudding/mousse instead.  They were fine.   Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was just disappointed all around."}
{"text":"We liked this place. We went here last night for date night. Kinda fancy and medium to High priced range. We had the risotto which was amazing! The food pairs well with certain wines, just ask them, and they'll be more than happy to help. Small cozy place, but nice. The quality of food was delicious   Burger-$12 Beef medallions-$26 Salmon-$26 Scallops-$28"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Came in about 15 minutes before closing and our waiter still took excellent care of us and was very knowledgeable. Every item that me and my friends ordered was mouth wateringly delicious. Highly recommended..best restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Went there last night for our anniversary because it is very close to our house. All I can say is WOW! from the salad to the scallops to the dessert things were just perfect. The scallops were incredible, best I have had! Service was wonderful as well! I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. Impeccable service and taste . Craig thank you for the incredible experience. I had the chicken, strawberry, mango salad and my husband had the Arizona Toast. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Originally posted 1/29/2014 (merged two accounts)  Found this place on a whim and was so impressed with service, quality of food and general atmosphere. Our sever Tommy was beyond friendly and super funny! With a colleague and we split beet salad, asparagus, truffle mac & cheese (oh my god is this good) and we also got the chocolate bread pudding.   Everything from beginning to end was great! I hope to return next I am in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the dinner we had last night at Rusconi's was by far the best I have had in years. John the server was very attentive, not at all rushy and very knowledgeable.  Head Office had the Salmon and I had the Sea Bass, which was the best I've had, even including one I had in Chile!  Service was impeccable, the ambience ideal and the wine list was adequate.  For Dessert we shared a peach pudding which was made for the day fresh. It was delicious.  Very nice restaurant and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's not often I give a restaurant 5 stars but Rusconi's American Kitchen earned one. Recommended by some friends we decided to have dinner here on our last night in town. Clearly don't get swayed by the store front of the building or the fact that it's in a strip mall and next door to a sandwich shop. Once you step inside the door you'll be pleasantly surprised and understand what I'm talking about.   The inside of the restaurant has a warm feeling and the smell of wood fire and delicious food will quickly overwhelm you. The acoustics are perfect too. A little noise but not too much and you can easily carry on a conversation.  Our group decided on a variety of items on the menu. We started with the Artisan cheese. A generous assortment of meats, cheese, olives and roasted peppers. It was accompanied with grilled crostini. For entrees I just couldn't resist their version of a meatless lasagna. It's nothing like what you might expect. It's a tasty dish with a variety of veggies along with a few sheets of homemade pasta. It was delicious and something I could eat every night!  My hubby ordered the roasted salmon. The glaze was sweet and the \"mixture of tastes and textures was an amazing combination\". Others tried the mushroom soup and commented, \"the best they'd ever had\". The seared scallops were \"incredible\" and served on top of a bed of cauliflower puree. Service was exceptional and each one of our dishes was prepared perfectly.  This place is a gem. Certainly a winner in every category for me."}
{"text":"We were in Arizona for three days, and unfortunately I hardly had one good meal in this state.  In search for good food for fair prices, we came here.  We got the mushroom soup, pork belly, buffalo steak, their creme brulee, and coffee.   We arrived here with high hopes, which were crushed pretty quickly.  We were sat by the back door which was propped open on a very cold night.  So after sitting here for a little while, I asked for my boyfriend's jacket, and soon after, he had to go to the car to get another jacket so that we would both be covered.    Once we ordered our food, we had to wait a good while before the waiter came with the first course: pork belly and sausage.  He simply put the plate down on the table and walked away.  He didn't say here's your first course, or describe the meal, it felt to me as if he almost threw the plate in front of me.    The sausage was good, but both my boyfriend and I thought the pork belly was overdone, and it wasn't quite as fatty as we usually like.    Next was the soup and the buffalo.  We asked for the buffalo to be medium rare, which it wasn't.  It was cooked to medium with the last one third of it being well-done.    The soup while well seasoned and flavorful, seemed to lack body and depth.   Next we ordered coffee, which came to us almost cold, and the waiter never offered to refill our cup.  We also got the creme brulee since our waiter suggested it.  The creme was a trio: a vanilla, chocolate, and a pumpkin.   All three shared two problems: the sugar had been laid on a very thick layer, resulting on a think candy like crust instead of the mere crunch a proper creme brule would have.  The texture was also unpleasant, and it seemed like the eggs had curdled a bit, so it wasn't as smooth as I like.  Moreover, the pumpkin one really didn't taste that good at all.   We wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"When we left this restaurant everyone in our party said the same thing which summed up our experienced \" we can cross this place off our list\".  I really wanted to like this place, but it was a literal disappointment.  The place was beyond noisy and we could not hear ourselves speaking.  The seating is crammed it like sardines especially if you sit on the half booth like seats.  Since it took the wait staff over 40 minutes to bring out bread I expected it to smell yummy and be at least hot and taste amazing, nope not even real butter, hard crust, cold store bought bread.  Then the real problems came along.  It took over one hour for us to receive our salads after we placed orders.  2 1/2 hrs for a dinner service sitting on very uncomfortable seats, wow very long.  The food was just ok nothing to write home about it was actually rather boring and very small amount,  We went in hungry and came out hungry.  Not much food very overpriced and nothing was really good but more on the boring side.  Taylor the waiter was great and very attentive.  Maybe they were having a bad night.   Another thing I do not like is when someone touches my food.  If I worked for the health department, this restaurant would get a C if best because the owner who stands at the kitchen and previews each plate which comes out touches the food with his bare hands, he does not wear gloves when he puts your toppings on your salad and does not use a spoon, he uses his bare hands and it is disgusting and unsafe.  He wipes his hands on a blue towel which is also used to clean the plates and re uses the towel over and over again.  It is not very sanitary.  The bread was terrible, the garlic risotto was pretty good a little on the salty side, the asparagus was okay along with the truffle mac and cheese ok.  Like I said nothing to write home about, nothing tickled my taste buds and it was basically a very boring meal or rather half a meal not much on the plate.  Came Hungry Left Hungry no wow factor but all the plates looked really nice.  We will not be back.  -   The next day, The owner Michael Rusconi called us probably trying to find the person who wrote the review. boy very very rude.  Be very careful about dining here especially if the owner can not take diners reviews.   He did not even apologize for touching people's food which is a no no in the restaurant business.  I wanted something which tasted amazing and wowed my taste buds, not sure why this was do hard for him to understand.  Owner is Very Very Rude.  Be careful!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here for lunch. I'm from LA area, and the first time we came to Scottsdale for a little vacation and stumbled upon this place. Absolutely loved it. The food was amazing, very fresh, great presentation, cool ambiance and great service. Also, very reasonably priced, I was pleasantly surprised considering it's a \"new American\" type of place. We found ourselves back for another little getaway, and even though we're staying 30 minutes from here we just had to come back. It was another great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week fall 2017. Made a reservation and was promptly seated. Ambiance was great - partially opened kitchen which was cool. The food options for restaurant week all seemed great - I got shrimp and grits for appetizer; scallops; and s'mores in a jar. The menu also included a beverage so was an excellent value. Everything was perfectly cooked - great flavors and the service was fantastic. Only small compliant is that they only have a one stall restroom so was a small wait on a Friday night but would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great drinks. The Mussels are my favorite!  The Happy Hour is good!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It's a very unassuming location tucked away in a strip mall, but the inside is surprisingly spacious with a cozy atmosphere.   A few of my favorites have been the grilled salmon, the beef tenderloin medallions, and the sea scallops. And try the white truffle scented mac-n-cheese!   For desert, the chocolate bread pudding is to-die-for.   Service has been consistently attentive and friendly. Great spot for a date night or a family meal. It's my parent's new favorite spot when they come into town."}
{"text":"My husband and I went with another couple and we all unanimously agreed this was a great place! Between the 4 of us, we had the Kitchen Board, Baby Field Green Salad, Soup, Braised Beef Short Ribs and the Beef Tenderloin Medallions. We all agreed the Beef Tenderloin Medallions with truffle mac and cheese was the best even though we all enjoyed our dishes. I had the Fresno Kid cocktail which was fantastic! The guys had old fashions and said they were spot on. The service was exceptional and our waiter Fitz was a blast. Very attentive and funny. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by family, so I had to check it out...  Great meal tonight! Pleasant service. Wonderful presentations and superb flavors, expertly prepared.  REALLY impressed! (And I'm not so easy to impress!)  Surprising sophistication to be found in an upscale strip center. Much more there than it first appears.  I will return.   Thought I was \"early\" arriving at 5:30 on a Tuesday, but the place was already humming. Apparently many others share my enthusiasm.  Prices are very reasonable;represented great value and true enjoyment!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for restaurants where the chefs are culinary artists and the prices are not exorbitant.  A long-time prototype of this genre is Rancho Pinot, but Rusconi's is similar in approach, slightly less expensive, and almost as good.  The keys are flavor profiles and appealing presentations.  A lot of cooks can put four things on a plate, each of which is good, but making them complement one another is a skill.  Take Rusconi's shrimp and grits appetizer.  The addition of some small oblongs of sausage and of cherry tomatoes for an acidic note was genius, accenting superbly the perfectly grilled shrimp and creamy grits.  Similar complements could be paid to our other selections with a special nod to the scallops for flawless preparation and a large portion.  The atmosphere is modern with just the right level of buzz, without being noisy, the service is very professional, and the check ended up being about $50 per person (one drink, appetizer, entree, shared dessert) including tax and tip."}
{"text":"This is the best managed, best service ( Brian), best bar, best kitchen (shoutout to Megan) and bottom line the best food in the Valley. Each person we had contact with is so into doing what they do well that it is the gem of Phoenix. Thank you, Ms. Rusconi, for your heart and mind and dedication. We love you guys!!   Okay, details. The muscles are the best! I lived in Seattle 7 years and never had fresher, plumper muscles! The specials are special. Scallops delicious. Savory bread pudding is great.   Just go. Try it. You can't lose because the pricing is fair. You don't feel jabbed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went here based on watching Check Please Arizona - the food was good the service was excellent.  They are kind of behind a shopping mall so a little hard to find. But the waiter, was really helpful. And the food was very good."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here with Hannah. Service was excellent, wine was fantastic, and the food was perfect. Definitely making this one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner last week with three other people and it was the perfect pick. We had a reservation and were sat right away in view of the kitchen, which was fun because we got to see all the action.  All of the food looked incredible as it went by and it did not disappoint when we ordered! Two of my party got the steak (I forget which one) which came with the most delicious macaroni and cheese that I've probably ever had. My other friend got the salmon that she really enjoyed and I chose the pork osso bucco. I'm not really a pork person, but it looked SO good that I couldn't resist. Wow. Amazing. It fell right off the bone and was perfectly paired with the prickly pear cabbage. Needless to say, we did a good amount of eating off each other's plates and they were clean by the end of the night.  Dessert was pretty good. The panna cotta was light and refreshing and the empanadas hit our fried sweet spot. Service was excellent and the decor was beautiful. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. Very unique menu.  It is going to be a huge success b/c there is nothing like it around there and of course the food is amazing.  The owner/chef has worked at fabulous restaruants here in the valley.  I think part of the staff needs to be trained a little more.  But I have had servers there that were also amazing and very professional.  They have a cute little fire place you can sit near and is great when the weather is cold. I can't wait until they open up for brunch. BRAVO Mr. Rusconi."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great menu, AMAZING food.  I am giving it 5 stars because I loved it however.....the mirror in the women's bathroom is so high I can't see into it. Which turned out to be the funniest thing I've ever experienced in my life. Short people problems. Haha. I highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"Top quality food, freshly made to order. Professional wait staff. Friendly bar tender. My favorite is the salmon dish the glaze is excellent. Everything cooked to perfection. I like the intimate atmosphere. Very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  I'm second time here and I still would come back. That should say something about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food! One of my favorite places! I recommend the salmon and the filet. The mac n' cheese is amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved It From Beginning to End Had heard only good things about Rusconis so decided to try it Saturday night. Located on a shopping center you just don't expect it to be anything special.....but that it is. The hostess greeted our party and although we were early for our reservation- she seated us promptly. Decor is upscale modern- very nice. It was very busy yet able to carry on a conversation at our table. Our server, Jay, was charming. He asked if this was our first visit and took the time to explain the menu items. He was knowledgeable  about all the menu items and answered all questions we had.  My dining companion, a wine enthusiast, was very impressed with the wine list. We started with the Kitchen Board appetizer to compliment our wine.  Menu items are certainly different-we had  avocado and cucumber soup, figs stuffed with blue cheese wrapped in prosciutto , shrimp and grits,squash and goat geese bread pudding ( outstanding), duck confit and diver scallops. Everything was beautifully served, presentation outstanding but beyond that everything was just delicious! The desserts looked amazing so we orders 4! The warm chocolate bread pudding with homemade bourbon vanilla ice cream was incredible.  The portions are not huge....but because of this we were able to enjoy three courses and were full when we left. Hats off to Chef Michael!"}
{"text":"Hit all the way around. Was there for brunch on a Sunday at opening.   The Good  1. Outstanding wait staff from the guys that fill your water to the waiter (Fritz). He was good enough to tip $20 on a $43 meal.  The hostess was very friendly and amiable considering we walked in  2 minutes after opening. By the time we left it was filling up quick.    2. Very inventive menu.  Slight tweaks to menu items that make it stand out over other average places.    3. Prices were reasonable for high quality.   4. Real pecan wood coal grill. Also, dry packed high quality scallops.    5. House made ice cream and sorbets. Cool flavors like raspberry/chocolate chip, blackberry/cinnamon sorbet, and some gelato flavors too.   Very good house coffee too. Looks light a lighter roast but good bold flavor without being bitter.    The not so good.  It's a bit hard to find because the strip mall is so far off the street. Obviously that is no fault of the cafe but it's worth seeking out for sure."}
{"text":"Chef Rusconi has done a great job with his restaurant.  The decor is nice, service was attentive and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood spots. Cozy, well managed and most importantly, excellent food. We have tried several items and have never had a bad meal.  My favorite dish is the braised short ribs prepared in a light gravy cooked until it is so tender it pulls apart with your fork. You can tell it has been marinated for a while. No salt or pepper needed. Perfect every time.  I have to mention the wait staff who does an excellent job. From the management to the hostess, everyone does their best to make you feel appreciated."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for about the 10th time.  It is a great restaurant.  It never fails that I mention 2 or 3 places for dinner and whomever I am meeting says \"What's Rusconi's?\"  Gasp!  Where were you in 2013?  Consistently good food.  Always a couple of favorites on the menu with a few featured/specials/seasonal items peppered in.  Everything is very good.  Prices are really reasonable.  We had the scallops and the buffalo sirloin this time with, my favorite, a side of prickly pear cabbage (please don't ever take that off your menu).  Total dinner price for two entrees, a side and (non-alcocholic) drinks = ~$60.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. We love to sit on the patio when we eat out, even when it is a little warm. They accommodated us happily and our sevice didn't suffer even though we were the only guests on the patio. We ordered a smorgasbord of appetizers and sides so we got to try a great variety of dishes. The best was the pork belly and grits (special) but honestly everything was great. Cold cilantro avocado soup, roasted Brussels sprouts, field greens with grilled peaches and goat cheese and the bread pudding was outstanding. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our first time in. Great food. Excellent service and very nice ambiance. We'll be back many times. It's definitely a good find."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour! I actually have been Eye balling this place for sometime because of the reviews. I would say it's nice not my top. I am thinking brunch might be their thing? Maybe. Not bad... just probably won't visit again. Maybe I'll try brunch though"}
{"text":"Great choices on menu. Food was yummy. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was here a few wks back and had the chicken and cavatelli pasta with vegetables. It was good and a large portion. Atmosphere was pleasant, and service was good."}
{"text":"I just ate here again and was re-impressed by the recipes and quality ingredients. I had to update to 5 stars"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch one day in the middle of the week, got seated quickly and loved the atmosphere. I'm vegetarian and they accommodated me quite well. I opted for the  roasted turkey panini but sans turkey. The waitress offered to see if the chef could instead sub zucchini and  yellow squash. It was very delicious and the side salad had a yummy vinaigrette. Overall great service, glad to see this type of restaurant in a crowded area with limited fine dining selections."}
{"text":"Perfection in every way! Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Chef Michael watches over every dish & finishes them with love. Great everything!"}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner to avoid sitting in traffic.  Since it was our first visit we were unaware that from 4-5pm the only menu items that were available were the Happy Hour selections. We split the fondue, husband had the sliders and I had the chicken salad- all were excellent and we will definitely be coming back for dinner!! Excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"We were in town last weekeend and made a reservation for Sunday night. When we got there we were  greeted warmly and professionaly. The hostess chatted us up while taking us to our table, personalizing the experience. Our sever came over quickly and started to explain some of the menu items . After receiving our beverages, we ordered our meal. We got the pork belly app, and flat bread pizza, braised short ribs and the butternut squash raviolis'. It's evident Rusconi's use fresh ingredients and home made techniques. The pork belly was tender and melted in my mouth. The flat bread was crispy but not overcooked. It was topped with fresh tomato's and mozzarella. The butternut squash ravioli's come as 3 large home made ravioli's with a corn jus. The short ribs were braised perfectly and were served with a knife which I just put to the side because it wasn't needed. The were so tender and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and don't pass up Rusconi's Kitchen. There's no other restaurant like it near by. There's plenty of restaurants near by but none of the quality of Rusconi's. So if your in North Phoenix make it a priority to get there."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience to say the least. Just visited there and had good food and Colin the bartender was great. We had a gift certificate we got in a charity cancer auction and the value was for 320 dollars. There was some language in the gift certificate that stated a special chef prepared dinner. The chef decided to interpret that as everything we had just ordered wasn't allowed with the gift certificate.  Maybe we misunderstood but he didn't offer anything off of the bill. If it is truly 320 dollars in value tough to understand how we don't get something off the tab. Unbelievable how bad he handled this. We were willing to agree with the chef but giving some sort of discount anyone else would have done given the way the gift certificate read. I wouldn't want to give another dime to this place."}
{"text":"This is a food lovers paradise.  It was simply fantastic.  You can really tell they have a talented chef that cares about his food and wants to give you the best they can.  They deliver on that promise.  There is not a better restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service.  This place says they're open until 10:00pm; however, when our family of 4 walked in at 9:10pm, we were told that the chef called it a night since it was a slow day and that we should try one of the other restaurants around the corner.  I've worked in various restaurants for years, have eaten at my fair share of well-named restaurants around the country,... and really have no respect for bad restauranteurs.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"I rarely give places 5 stars but I honestly cannot think of anything bad about this place. We had a reservation but they sat us immediately. The waiter was very attentive, the head chef was expediting orders on a Monday night which I was impressed with, and the food was great.  I had the pork osso bucco and my wife had the paella; we also had the short rib appetizer. Everything was amazingly done. Also, for dessert my wife coconut panna cotta with diced mango for dinner... again, another amazing meal.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love the food and the people. This reminds me of the places I use to go to back in Boston - a true treat having this place right down the road!"}
{"text":"A friend of ours told us about this place and wouldn't stop singing its praises. So when we were looking to do something for dinner tonight we decided to give this place a try.   Wow! My husband and I had the absolute best dinner here. We both shared the kitchen board to start. The smoked duck comes with a glass over it. When we removed the glass, the smoke and aroma was intoxicating. We both had the sirloin medallions with truffle scented Mac n cheese with red wine reduction. The combination of flavors were amazing! We then had the dark chocolate bread pudding. I've never really cared for bread pudding but acquiesced to share an order with my husband who enjoys it. My husband and I fought over it, blocking each other's spoons. Lol! Our waiter was friendly and very attentive which further enhanced our dinner. We both enjoyed dinner so much, we even made a reservation for the Fathers Day ribeye dinner."}
{"text":"Love this little place - food and service are always excellent. It does get busy sometimes and the wait for food is longer, but I don't mind - it's worth the wait!  Update: Yep, this place is still the best!!! When I was nursing, I couldn't eat dairy or soy due to my baby having a food sensitivity. They always worked to find something I could eat and it was always delicious! I can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"WOW! Service was excellent, food was divine, and atmosphere was incredibly charming. I had the Ahi Tuna and it was as fresh and tender as if I was seating at some seaside cafe (as opposed to being in the middle of the desert). The location is in the middle of a stretch mall / plaza type situation with Panda Express on one side and a pizzeria on the other, which really makes you question it at first. But nope, this is just one oddly placed gem!"}
{"text":"I came here on a work meeting today and I was surprised how accommodating this restaurant was. Although there were no vegan options on the menu, they were able to accommodate to my needs, which was wonderful and can be very rare for restaurants to do so especially when it is not an option on the menu. I even requested EVOO instead of canola oil, and they were able to accommodate to that as well. I was pleasantly surprised and very happy."}
{"text":"Love the truffle Mac and cheese!! Cute place near my house. Friendly staff. Food was good."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant!  Everything was impeccable, from the greeting to the table service. I have never seen a chef care so much for his food as Chef Michael does.  He inspects every plate before it leaves the kitchen.   Tucked in on the corner of Shea and Tatum, it is definitely the diamond in the rough!!"}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner and was blown away.  It was one of the best meals I have had in a while.  I had the chicken.  It was delicious The standout was the fired green tomato.  It was served with burrata cheese, greens, and sorbet... not things that I would expect to go together.  It was perfect!  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to Rusconi's today for happy hour with my 90 year old friend who is blind and in a wheelchair as she had polio as a child and cannot walk.  There was one table available but we were told it was too small for 3 people and it was reserved.  So the hostess said our disabled friend could sit as the bar.  There is no way she could do that.  I asked for the manager and asked him if he could accommodate us.  Plenty of tables in the dining room but they could not go against policy and seat us there.  The manager asked another table of two   people to move from the four top to a two top and gave us their table in the happy hour area.  Hard and fast rules at Rusconi's."}
{"text":"Pretty bummed the hostess and manager ruined our experience here. I checked to see if they could be accommodating for my parents,Dad in a wheelchair.... the hostess was rude, worthless, and didn't listen.. she suggested to eat outside in 100 degree weather.. the manager walked over, seemed to want to be helpful and pretended to be empathetic and said he would accommodate us ... so I got my parents out of the car, not an easy task... and went in.. to find no effort what so ever to accommodate.. in-fact, they were completely rude.. the manager is arrogant and should mind his own business...I blame his lack of empathy, his fake bs, and his intent to continue to bother us throughout the meal for my bad experience... the food was fine, mine was cold.. but fine...the waiter was nice and very understanding... but I am beyond shocked how we were treated...very unprofessional.  Maybe they just don't want handicap people in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Another delicious, expertly prepared meal. My friend had the scallops and I had the mussels. The presentation of each dish was beautiful. A truly scrumptious dinner!"}
{"text":"Located between an Panda Express and a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich shop my family and I decided to check out this restaurant.  I looked on Yelp and the reviews were pretty good. I peak inside the door, it looks empty. We had a party of six and walked in about 5pm.  The restaurant is not busy at the moment and there were three tables occupied at the time.  One of which is outside on the patio.  So, there we are standing in front of the hostess stand.  All six of us.  The host finally asks us \"can I help you?\". I reply \"yes, six for dinner, please.\"  She looks down...we wait....finally she says to us...\"my next available for six is 8pm\".  No, I didn't have a reservation.  She didn't ask, anyways. That was it.  She moved on to other concerns and walked away.  Ok, I didn't know reservations were required at such a fancy strip mall restaurant....my fault.  However, I felt her intention was to make me feel stupid for not knowing.  Obviously standing there with six people at 5pm, I'm not there to make reservations for 8pm.  So...what to do? We left and went to an excellent local brew house restaurant across the street named OHSO.  We had an excellent time and dinner.  And the hostess was very nice. Oh and I got a phone call at about 8:15 asking about a reservation made on Open Table for six."}
{"text":"First time trying this little place down the street from pv mall. It's a little hidden but that's what I love about it. Giant open doors connect to the bar gives it an open feel but the bar still has a great cozy feel. They have a great little happy hour in the bar that filled me and my boyfriend up. The sliders are on pretzel buns and they are to die for. Our burger came with great different sauces as well. Our bartender, Colin was great too and put the baseball game on for us. Super nice and knew the menu and also the area very well. Also have oak creek beer on tap, love to see places have local beers. Had the Brie cheesecake for dessert which was outstanding as well.   Over all a great 5 star restaurant on Tatum and a monthly date spot!"}
{"text":"Will agree with most everyone else, Food was exceptional! Had some interesting combinations and it was hard to choose.  Service was impeccable and a great balance from being attentive and being TOO attentive.   To be fair, we (a group of 6) got there at 8:30 on a Saturday night, so the dinner rush was passed. But I cannot imagine it making much of a difference if it was crowded!!"}
{"text":"We came for my mother-in-law's birthday and I made the reservation on Open Table. I arrived and took in the small, but neat dining/bar area. When our group arrived we were seated less than 20 feet from the bar in the \"dining area\". Did I mention we were the first and only ones in the restaurant at the time?  I told our young server that we were celebrating a special occasion. I believe she forgot because it wasn't brought up or addressed at any point during our time there. Our service was absolutely terrible the entire time we were there.   We noticed that it was \"happy hour\" which seemed like a great deal and asked our server if we could begin ordering beverages. She curtly told us, \"Actually, you can't order happy hour here, it's only at the bar.\" Fine. My husband was about to stand up to order our drinks at the bar and was stopped and told, \"No, you can't bring your drinks back to your table from the bar. I can't let you do that.\" We were shocked. The bar was less than 20 feet away. The restaurant is tiny. Our server was already being less than pleasant and we had come on recommendation from a friend who told us the food was stellar.   My husband and mother-in-law began to ask why we couldn't just order our drinks at the bar and bring them over to our table before dinner when our server sighed loudly (I wish I could make this up) rolled her eyes at us, and said, \"Can you hang on a minute?\" and walked away. She returned 5 minutes later with the manager (we hadn't made a big deal about anything, only wanted to ask why we couldn't order drinks for happy hour at the bar) and he began, \"I hate being the bearer of bad news, but I think I'm going to be. We don't want to ruin your dining experience by having you go back and forth to the bar to get drinks so we can't allow you to order them there. (IT WAS LESS THAN 20. FEET. AWAY) but we can break you up and sit you on high tops there..\" Who does that? Doesn't allow you to order at the bar while you're eating. And our waitress went out of her way to be rude to our table. At this point we were ready to leave, but we were starving, and gave in.   We ordered chicken salads, burgers, fries, a cheese dip... Waitress took our order by memory, forgot a few things, surprise surprise, and after coming back multiple times rather than just writing it down the first time, finally got it right. Food was decent, not fantastic. The best part of the meal was the truffle fries. We weren't apologized to, the birthday was forgotten.   There are far better restaurants in the area with incredible service, which truly defines your experience. We won't be back and will make sure to tell our friends and family about our terrible experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service. Taylor is our favorite waiter. The menu changes frequently and each dish is better than the last. We took our preschoolers with us because it was a family birthday celebration and for an upscale restaurant they were so very accommodating , making the best Mac n cheese for them and even an adorable flower apple plate because my 4 year old asked for apples and Mac n cheese even though it was not on the menu. We also have stopped by for just drinks And desert and the bartender is excellent. Our favorite neighborhood place !"}
{"text":"Our third visit.  Our food was delicious. We had a very attentive waiter who was engaging and helpful on the menu.  The short rib special was excellent.  Good atmosphere.  We sit outside on the patio when it's nice."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet a friend for lunch.  Great food, animated waiter, and a peaceful atmosphere.  My friend had the salmon salad and I have the chicken sandwich.  Both meals were fresh and flavorful.  The roasted cauliflower soup sounded better than it tasted but once we added a little salt and pepper we liked it more."}
{"text":"We've been to Rusconi's many times since they opened a few years ago.  Up until tonight we've been very pleased with every experience.  We had 7pm reservations and the restaurant was amazingly quiet for a Saturday night in Nov.  We found this unusual because even during the summer it's a busy establishment.  Eventually the restaurant filled up, but that was to their, and our, detriment.  The service (I'm not blaming the server, he's just the messenger) was very slow and spotty.  Dinner and drinks were served promptly, but that sharpness dropped off as quickly as our dinner was served.  Water glasses were left empty and when eventually refilled, were filled with warm water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for dessert, which never showed up, and eventually told them to forget the order and bring us our check.  If this wasn't bad enough, one of our guests never even had dinner because her entree (a chicken salad of all things) was so salty, it was inedible.  The waiter did put in another order for the same salad, but because everyone else was complaining about how salty their dinners were, our guest chose to cancel her dinner order and take a bite off her friends' plates.  We're not just talking a wee bit too salty, we're talking about a Morton's salt shaker being dumped on the entrees.  I am sure the restaurant will continue to pack them in during high season, and I hope they do because I like to see all local businesses succeed, but I do hope management reads this post so as to correct what's easily correctable in a nanosecond... quicker kitchen, improved service and PLEASE cut back on the overdose of salt you're dumping on everything you serve.  If people need to add salt to their food, they can do so at their own liking and pace.  Please take these suggestions to heart because prior to tonight's experience this was always a fabulous evening out.  For the near future our party will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. Just ate at Rusconi's and the meal was great. Healthy pours of drinks and wonderful food. Took my coworkers and to Amman, we all loved it. Definitely will be back In on our next stop!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service.  Not much more to say it is a must try in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Made it back in for dinner.  Friday night at 8pm, a couple seats open - so we were pleased to be seated without a reservation.  Our server was very pleasant.  I went with the \"Pecan Wood Grilled Beef Tenderloin Medallions\" med-rare.  It came back rare - so unfortunately I had to send it back - the server was sharp - she offered to keep my friends meal heated while they got mine right - so thumbs up on her thinking!  It was very flavorful - excellent presentation - downside the other medallion was a completely different piece of meat that wasn't very palatable (very unfortunate - though it can happen - I didn't complain - as I didn't have a big appetite this eve).  I would recommend the dish otherwise.  We were given time to have a pleasant conversation and were checked on regularly.  I'll try it again - just not at the top of my list.  See my prior review for additional information..."}
{"text":"Service was personable and prompt.  An amazing food experience. From the artichoke & parmesan soup to the beef tenderloins to the empanada desert. Everything was WoW Factor Good!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! I had the salmon, and the chef cooked it EXACTLY how I'd wanted it..after he personally came to our table and asked what exactly I'd meant by \"slightly charred\"...it was perfect.  My boyfriend had the lamb, and that was delightful too. The pistachio ice cream is definitely a must-try - you can tell its not that artificial junk with food dyes in it. They make the ice cream in house, and it's all natural, amazing deliciousness. The service was excellent as well; from the hostess to the waiters to the chef himself (Mike), this is definitely a restaurant to check out. I will most definitely be back to visit! If I could give it more stars I would."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. To be completely honest, I was a little put off by the location (sandwiched between a Panda Express and Corleone's). Location aside, the food was fantastic, the service was stellar and the interior was welcoming and much larger than what meets the eye from the exterior. Prices are worth it, the lamb was perfect."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and we will for sure be going back! It was busy so make a reservation. We got lucky and sat on the patio. We ordered a few apps and all were amazing! The risotto is to die for! Full of flavor. Also did the tomato fondue, cheese and meet plate, Mac n cheese and crab cake. All were equally amazing!! Can't wait to go back and order an entree."}
{"text":"What you've read in other reviews is true. Rusconi's American Kitchen is a gem. You don't expect much from the parking lot, with the restaurant lodged in between a Panda Express and an modest Italian joint, but it's delightful once you're inside. One in our party, an individual still depressed by having to return to Arizona after living in Manhattan, stated, \"It reminds me of a restaurant I would have gone to in New York City, but with cheaper prices.\"   Our favorite dish, odd given all the wonderful entrees we were served, was the White Truffle scented Mac N Cheese. Who knew? Searching to find something to critique, I might say it was a little loud inside, but the we were there on a Saturday night. Further, the front wall of the restaurant was open for patio seating, causing a bit of a draft on this cold night. Solved by a sweater. But those are small things. Rusconi's excelled in the big things: food and service.  Definitely make a reservation if you are planning on dining here during a busy time. With 300 yelp reviews averaging four and a half stars, this gem is no longer hidden."}
{"text":"Sexy, cool, trendy, artsy but upscale vibe as you walk thru the doors. Delicious, creative, mouth watering decisions as you scan the menu. Beer, wine, bubbles and mixed drinks while you wait for your first plate in anticipation. Relaxing cool music , design and architecture to check out while you chill out. Attentive servers, hot scrumptious food and full satisfied stomachs. Happy full and slightly tipsy couple.  Returning is a for sure.  LoVe"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with my family on Monday night. Love this restaurant. They do such a great job. Food is excellent and the service is equal.  The grouper which was one of the specials was outstanding. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in my neighborhood. Don't miss this place. The lunch and dinner menus are incredible and the cocktails are crafty. Can't beat it. Also, ask for Holden if you go in, best server/bartender we've ever had."}
{"text":"I have tried three times to go to this restaurant for lunch and all three times they were closed. Once on a Saturday. Once on a Monday. And again this past Thursday. Three strikes and you're out. And yes they serve lunch."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here with my mom!  She had actually already eaten, so she tried the soup.  Delicious!  I had a salad that was very fresh and tasty.  The waiter was attentive.  Great experience!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm very sad to say that I am changing one of my very few 5 star reviews to 2 stars.  We are total foodies and this was on our top 5 list and my husband even recommended this restaurant to many of his out-of-town clients.   We went tonight to celebrate my son's completion of his first year of college. We ordered the short rib and shrimp appetizers. We have had the short rib before and it was not good tonight. We also did not enjoy the shrimp. They were both loaded in sauces and we all found it to be overwhelming. The smothering of sauces is definitely a new one for them as we have been here many times before. The presentation was very pretty but the dishes are not tasty anymore.  I ordered salmon, my husband ordered pork, my older son ordered mussels, and my younger son ordered the tenderloin. My salmon was room temperature and mediocre. My husband's pork was dry, and my older son's mussels were very fishy. My older son did order the budino (his favorite dessert) and it did not disappoint.   I would not recommend this place to anyone again. I don't know what happened but our experience was entirely disappointing all around."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here for the first time. We found the service and food much above average. Price was very reasonable and presentation was very excellent. We plan to take a group of friends there soon."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Rusconi's last night and now kicking ourselves for not going sooner.  We have lived in Scottsdale for almost 5 years and have eaten at a lot of very nice restaurants across the city.  Rusconi's puts all of those restaurants to shame in terms of both food and service.  We also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  I had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly...and that blackberry glaze!  My husband enjoyed the scallops, which were the best he's ever had.  The truffled mac n cheese is to die for, but so is the dark chocolate bread pudding!  I could go on and on... a huge thank you to Michael Rusconi for the decadent meal and to Craig, Fritz, and Nancy for the amazing service!  What a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything we had was prepared perfectly with such flavor and excellent presentation. Warm and friendly service from bobby at the bar both times we went. If it was closer to my house, I would be there far too often. Great place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the food was excellent!  First time had cauliflower soup and Garlic crusted Rack of Lamb (was the special that time).  Last night had a argula fig salad (appetizer special) and the Butternut Squash Ravioli.  Had a delicious creme brulee for desert.  Both times I have gone I had the same waiter and he was excellent.  The first time we were a party of 7, and last time there were 11 of us.  Service was excellent for a large group."}
{"text":"Now I understand why this was on the Top 10 Neighborhood Restaurant list...food and service were outstanding!  And I do not use that adjective too often.  I had the scallops and my friend had the beef medallions.  Perfection!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The blackberry salmon is a must get along with the pork loin. You don't even need to look at the dessert menu, just order the chocolate bread pudding. Great service too. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Still the best place in Scottsdale!  The drinks is good and the food is fabulous!   If you haven't been you owe it to yourself to stop in."}
{"text":"Sorry not to agree with everyone else but the place was OK. Even our friends raved about it. The service was excellent and the board was not Boars Head cold cuts. The place was very nice and the menus were limited. Prices were a little high for a little hidden place like that. My wife and I without any alcohol was close to $100. I I think there are plenty of places like Eddie V's you can enjoy with entertainment for the same money. Nice place very busy Saturday if I do go back it will be for lunch. I think that's what most reviews were based on. Sorry, but this is my opinion"}
{"text":"Not a great location, don't love the sign, but once you get past that you are in for a treat.  Great design and atmosphere, only enhanced by the delicious smell that attacks your senses approximately 1 step into the restaurant.  Staff is professional and attentive.  The menu has options with great range and really leave you in a predicament.  We had the salmon and the lamb.  Lamb was really good, but the salmon is incredible. Wine list is fairly priced and has the half bottle option on some great Cabs.  Only recommendation (outside of location and sign), is a shake up of the starters menu.  Kudos and I hope you are here for a long time!"}
{"text":"We have been to Rusconi's many times since it opened, and have never been disappointed.  Great food - the scallops and the vegetarian bread pudding dish are my favorites.  Terrific service - the waiters are fun, professional, and friendly.  A favorite place."}
{"text":"Happy hour will get you 1/2 off glasses of wine which is good. But the real reason to come here- their truffle mac and cheese. Seriously you guys... you have to try it.   Other items I've tried- charcuterie is a great deal and delicious. You get a lot on that block. Their desserts are fantastic. The short rib appetizer is not as stellar as the mac and cheese but it's pretty good still. The tenderloin main that comes with the mac and cheese is great, obviously.   Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch when visiting from out of town. Chose it because it's rated as #2 restaraunt in phoenix. It was ok but not wonderful. Chicken salad wasn't anything to brag about. My husband had the roasted chicken sandwich and he said it looked better than it tasted."}
{"text":"Don't let the front of the restaurant fool you, this is a great place. We had been meaning to try Rusconi's for a few years, we live in Mesa so it's a bit of a drive; but how glad we are that we did. All of the food tasted wonderful, the presentation was very nice and the staff was friendly as well. The only two points on which we were a little disappointed is that we were seated in a corner right next to a wall. It made it a little difficult for my husband to eat and we didn't get to see as much of the beautiful restaurant as we would have liked. Also, my husband was a little sad that one of the pieces of \"lamb\" in his meal was actually a piece of fat and he was enjoying the dish so much he was disappointed it was gone. While all the food was very good I have to say I crave the piquello polenta. The way the flavors unfold in your mouth...it's just divine.  We loved it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great value!  Excellent food and a very reasonably-priced wine list.  I'm from the Bay Area and typically see outrageously priced wines outside California. This place was an unexpected find!  Very well prepared food that tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. When I asked a question about the wines, I received a very well-informed answer.  The chef came by at the table to check on us later during the meal; he obviously cares about his customers.  I will go back on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was fantastic. I loved the salmon. It was a special occasion and the service made the evening more special. Great fun."}
{"text":"A perfect meal with fun friends!  We arrived right before Happy Hour was ending and got lucky to snag a booth in the bar.  We enjoyed a few glasses of wine at a discount- and jumped right into dinner.  Our server notified us that there was one Monkfish Special left if we wanted to reserve it.  Before he could finish his sentence I was in!  Love Monkfish-and it is hard to find in the valley.  It was succulent and lobster like-just as I desire.  It was served with a creamy risotto-perfectly cooked.  One of my friends ordered the Scallops-and they tasted like they were just scooped out of the sea.  Our server was relaxed, informed and allowed us to leisurely enjoy our meal.  Quite a romantic spot-time to invite my hubby for Date Night!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now in the past two weeks and have not been disappointed. Service is amazing, restaurant is upscale, and the food is outstanding. I've tried the tenderloin medallions and the green chile sliders. The truffle fries and the mac n cheese is exceptional. I recommend this place to anyone in the area of Tatum & Shea. It's a great neighborhood gem"}
{"text":"Went with friends last night. Actually did starters and wine at home first, so not looking for a huge meal.  Busy, moderately loud, had to wait 15+ minutes for our 8PM reservation. Not a problem, though.  Our waiter was very attentive at first, but then was a bit hard to find. I think he had too many tables in the busy back.  Thoroughly enjoyed our meals. For me, a non-meat eater (and the menu does lean towards meat and chicken), the Ravioli on veggies with Goat Cheese was excellent. Al dente, even needing a knife assist, but not under-done. My wife had the Ntural Chicken dish - looked very meaty and moist. Our friends had the mussels and the Osso Bucco.  Let's put it this way - not a scrap left on any plate! But alas, no room for the desserts that looked so good. Maybe next time. And there will be a next time.  And a nice bonus - moderate cost. WIth a bottle of wine, $65 per couple, incl tax and tip."}
{"text":"Great place!! Server was super friendly and helpful. I found the svc a little slow only bc a local was next to us and we ordered before them and he was out the door before we even saw our entree. Oh well, food was great though!!"}
{"text":"This is not my kinda place to frequent. However, they produce fine quality dining at a price that isn't going to cause bankruptcy. I had the chicken with risotto. Nice juicy chicken. Well done. I probably won't rerun as I said, these kind of restaurants are not my cup of tea. But if you're looking for a place to impress that lady, by all means."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and easy to talk to. The food was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in town from the Seattle area and were looking for a quaint place to go for dinner, so I got on Yelp to look for a place that had a happy-hour, was in walking distance and was highly rated. We found this listing for Rusconi's and headed out the door.  We arrived without a reservation as we intended on sitting in the bar. With arriving early, we chose a seat outside, to enjoy the sun.   Our waitress, Sharron was amazing, bringing drinks and making superb recommendations. One of our favorites were the scallops which were prepared to amaze and served on a glaze of squash. The appetizers were equally amazing!  This is a place that we would definitely go back to. In a word, Awesome!   Sharron, thank you for making our visit, an amazing memory.  Jim & Teri"}
{"text":"During an early morning Christmas shopping sojourn, we decided to stop into this delightful restaurant for the first time. Beautifully and simply appointed with elegant and high end touches, my husband and I were surprised and so pleased at the brunch menu options! A wonderful array of benedicts, sweet and fluffy pancake and French toast options as well as their original and Southwest spin on brunch classics.   However it was their crab cake Benedict that simply blew us away. Blue crab and shrimp, fresh, light, and so delightful!  I highly recommend this quaint hideaway that will delight you with their decor and especially their menu."}
{"text":"Went here for our wedding anniversary and LOVED it. At first when we pulled into the strip mall, I thought, \"Hm...\" but it was really wonderful. The decor is charming and very well thought out. The design features an open kitchen, which we were seated near, but we never had a problem with too much noise. Our server welcomed us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and was exceptionally attentive. The chef, who's from Chicago, stopped by the booth and talked with us for several minutes. The food (I had the Scottish salmon; my husband, the sea bass) was delicious. They've only been open about seven months but were decently busy for a Monday night.  The menu is not large but it IS varied - everything from Buffalo Sirloin to rack of lamb, scallops, etc. And the wine list is similarly not broad but excellent.   Our server said that on Friday and Saturday nights it's best to make a reservation; we had one for Monday but probably didn't need it.   Highly recommend and if we lived in Phoenix we'd definitely go back often. As it is, we're in Georgia and will have to rely on our AZ friends to help keep Rusconi's open. Check it out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, atmosphere was nice.  Service was a bit slow, but the place was really busy at the time.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We are fans of Rusconi's and have eaten there at least a dozen times. The food never fails to impress and satisfy.  But, and this is enough to make us decide to go elsewhere when discussing options, the waitstaff are simply overbearing and cloying and intrusive.  I am annoyed when waiters ask how \"we\" are doing. It's just irritating. They are not dining with us. They are waIting on us. .  Rusconi's have obviously trained their waiters to do this, and sometimes several times during the course of a visit.  If the restaurant is good, the delivery of the food, correctly prepared and placed in front of the person who ordered it, is more than sufficient.  Keeping an eye open on the tables to see if diners are looking for attention is also good.  Interrupting a meal and conversation with a sickly sweet request for affirmation is simply wrong.  I hope the chef/owner reads this and does something about it. I'd really like to go back again."}
{"text":"I live in Vegas, where I have access to amazing food and experiences at all times.  I frequent Cave Creek for a client and have been mostly disappointed when I venture out for food. My clients daughter mentioned her interest in a this new spot, so we decided to try it out.  This place is so much bigger than the front leads you to believe. The layout is inviting and simply designed. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating when I asked for a different table.   I worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and am a food snob (so I'm told).  With that said, my server Brian, made the entire experience perfection. I always believe you should trust your server because they eat the food the most!  But if you add the fact that Brian is also a passionate chef and knowledgable of the product, I didn't even have to look at the menu. I was sold.   Everything he suggested was fabulous and it was enjoyable to hear him explain the items in detail. The wines were a perfect pair to our food. He was on point!  If you visit this place ask for him!  My client was slap happy when we left and that makes me happy!  I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Service friendly and spot on. Food  amazing. Highly highly  recommended. This is a gem."}
{"text":"I found Rusconi's quite by accident when I was at Aaron Brothers picking up a framed print.  It was lunchtime and I was hungry, so I walked in and my life was forever changed:)  I enjoyed the Sirloin steak sandwich, which was the special that day (a Friday).  Fritz was my server (excellent server by the way) and I must say the entire experience was foodie Heaven!  Not only was the sandwich perfect, but I tried the chocolate bread pudding for dessert with a scoop of homemade butter pecan ice cream.  And people who know me know that I NEVER order dessert.  It was scrumdillyicious  My BF came up from Tucson the next day to visit and I took him there for dinner Saturday night.  We had the beef tenderloin medallions, salmon, kitchen board, and split the arugula/goat cheese salad.  He remarked that this was the most memorable dining experience he'd had since he visited San Diego several years ago and enjoyed a wonderful Italian restaurant there.  The food was glorious!  And again, the service was excellent--attentive without being intrusive.  I have been living in Phoenix since December and have tried MANY restaurants, Steak 44, Buck and Rider, Chelsea's Kitchen and many others--all of them really good, but Rusconi's is the standout and my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I plan to go there as often as I possibly can."}
{"text":"Super stoked when we saw this restaurant was opening at the corner of Tatum and Shea.  A much needed addition to this prime location with few dining options.  Walked in, sat at the bar, was immediately greeted by friendly staff and bartender - had a great signature margarita with splash of cran that was fantastic.  Short ribs were pull-apart tender and like dinner and dessert in one dish.  Sweet potato ravioli was scrumptious, and I really liked that the pasta was layered on a bed of spinach - made the dish very light and I left feeling perfectly satisfied."}
{"text":"Followed yelpers here after a terrible meal at North.   Our terrible meal was erased,  by great service and a fabulous meal.    Yes,  the strip mall facade is fooling,  once inside we were pleasantly surprised.   We sat at the community kitchen table for fun,  let me tell you....the kitchen manager or expeditor runs a tight ship there.  I started with the special salad of the evening,  blue cheese stuffed figs,  wrapped in prosciutto on arugula,  it was a perfect starter.   I then had the salmon,  which was cooked to perfection at medium rare,  hard to do with a thick cut.   It was perfect.   My daughter and husband both had delicious burgers,  not my thing at a good restaurant,  but their Angus meat had great flavor.....And of course who could say anything bad about Truffle Fries!!!!   Other than I finished theirs and I shouldn't have,  but they were too good not to.    After being unable to breath,  I couldn't say no to trying the Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding,  key word for me here was Dark.   It was so good,  yep polished it off."}
{"text":"A total neighborhood favorite!  We are regular patrons having frequented both their dinner and brunch offerings. Although located in a basic strip mall, the restaurant is not a basic everyday chain like the retail stores and fast food restaurants that surround it.  The food is definitely the highlight. The service can be spotty and when busy they can get backed up in the kitchen. Servers however are generally very nice although not as proficient on the menu or wine selections as one would like.    Ah now for the food. Brunch is great! Wonderful variety of menu items, both sweet and savory.  Flavors are spot on and the prices are really good for entrees ranging from $ 9-15.   Love love the Posole Soup! And another favorite is the strawberry and mascarpone stuffed French toast.  Honestly, I have been to brunch 4 times and every selection was very good.  Dinner is also not to be missed. From the pork chop to the glazed blackberry salmon! Super yum!  Definitely pricier though.   Rusconi's is solid! No to be missed if your in our hood!"}
{"text":"Decided on Rusconi's for a group dinner of 6 people; I called the day before to make the reservation. The man I spoke to said they were a little booked, but could accommodate us on the patio; I said no problem. Well, upon arriving the next night, we were told by the hostess that she couldn't find the reservation. I explained to her the conversation I'd had the evening before and almost immediately she went wide eyed and started to apologize. Basically, there had been a miscommunication on their end and early in the day, she had cancelled our reservation by accident.  As soon as she realized the mistake, she went to talk to her manager about how to fix the situation. After a little waiting maybe 10-15 minutes (another table had to clear out), we were escorted to a table right next to the kitchen. The restaurant is much smaller than I thought it would be, but it was elegantly decorated and very nice.  Right away, the manager sent over 2 of the \"kitchen board\" appetizers to further beg pardon for the mix up. It was filled with a selection of delicious cheeses, meats, bread and pickled veggies. I was especially impressed with the duck they served, as it was \"smoked\" underneath an upside lowball glass . Right before they serve it to you, the chef actually takes smoke and pipes it into the glass, filling it up so you can't see the meat. Then, they serve it to you, the waiter removes the glass and you consume. And you could definitely taste the smoke (in a good way).  Afterwards, our main courses arrived and all at our table were satisfied. Between us we tried the: tenderloin beef medallions, veggie & goat cheese ravioli, roasted chicken, blackberry glazed salmon and a massive cheese burger. All agreed that the food was super delicious. I can only speak for the beef but it was truly amazing. Easily one of the best cooked pieces of meat I've ever had. Truffle mac & cheese was fantastic too, as were the carrots with a yummy glaze.  All in all, a great experience. Could have gone the other way, but Rusconi's handled it perfectly. It's a little out the way for me to eat there too regularly (although I licked my plate clean and it was not a small portion, so maybe that's a good thing). However, I will definitely be back for another special occasion!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a sort of strip mall (next to Ross and Paradise Bakery...?) who woulda known this place serves some amazing food. The ambiance is very nice and it even has a wonderful aroma that just pulls you inside.  Been here a few times now and I have figured one thing out: everything on the menu tastes awesome (in my experience). Beef, fish, vegetarian...you can't go wrong. What a great chef!  I will keep coming back to try their new dishes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Delicious food. Portions are slightly on the smaller side but the quality is so great that it makes up for it. Seriously you cannot go wrong with this one.   Great atmosphere as well. Cool decor."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this weekend. Great food and great service! I had the steak medallions with the signature Mac and cheese. So delicious! I was hesitant because lately I have felt that Mac and cheese dishes are just  too rich but this was perfect! We had their dark chocolate bread pudding dessert which was amazing!!! We had to wait for a table and we chose to do that wait outside and someone immediately came out to offer us ice water!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here for lunch. I ordered the grilled shrimp with fruit and arugula salad. Everything was prepared perfectly. The avocado was at its best, the shrimp tasted like it just came out of the ocean, and the greens were delicate and fresh. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would've given this place 5 stars if they did not forget about my husbands entree.  But he did truly try to make it up to us, so we're happy with that. I just didn't like that his reason wasn't truthful.  Hubs ordered the lamb, I ordered the NY Strip, son ordered the cheese pizza.  We started off with the Schreiner sausage and Pork Belly with polenta appetizer.  It was amazing.  The glaze and apples on the pork belly gave it such a flavorful twist.  I loved every bite.  My entree and my sons came out shortly after that.  We were told that hubs meal was on his way.  A couple moments later, the server came back and asked what the hubs ordered, to which he replied, the lamb.  Okay, so this clearly meant he forgot to put my hubs order in, right?  Why would he come back to ask again what he ordered?  For the next 25 minutes, the server came out about 5 times to let us know that his dish would be out shortly.  The server comp'd a beer for him for his patience.  Came out later and said the Chef messed up his lamb the first time and was trying to perfect it for him the 2nd time and that's why it's taking so long - this is when I knew it was a lie because if that were the case, he should've told us that instead of coming out and asking what he ordered.  Finally when I was practically done with my meal, his lamb came out.  Hubs said he was so hungry that even if the lamb was not good, he would still think it was great.  Our server also comp'd us dessert for the trouble (and because we were celebrating our anniversary) - which was a warm chocolate bread pudding with vanilla sauce and berries.  We gobbled that thing up - it was incredibly tasty - warm, moist and flavorful.  Tommy, the server, definitely was great, he was attentive and friendly - it just made me irritated that he just couldn't be honest in saying that he forgot to put our order in instead of saying the Chef messed up.  We would've been fine either way.    We'll definitely come back to this place.  But yes, I gave it 1 less star for lack of honesty even though we had good service and great food.  Oh, and there was bread?  We weren't offered any..."}
{"text":"Incredible meal and incredible service. Thank you Collin! The Truffle Mac and Cheese and Veggie Bread pudding were out of this world. The Brie Cheesecake was unexpected too. Smooth and creamy not Brie tasting at all. Everything was excellent! Such a fine surprise find. We meant to go to another place across the street but they had a very long wait so found Rusconi's instead.  A find for sure. I just wish we lived closer.   Of course servers should check on their guests and ask them how they are doing. We did not find the service overbearing at all. In fact it was perfect! I served for many years and everything was great! Our conversation was never interrupted."}
{"text":"Rosconi's was a very pleasant surprise.... Not your usual strip mall experience!!! .... The atmosphere is casual, pleasant and very cozy !! I love that its not too loud and the service was great! (Always a great sign when the waitress has stayed since the beginning) The food was great !! It was simple and not pretending to be fancy and not pretending to be more than it is!!! We had burgers, osso bucco, salmon and chicken ..... It was all really really good and we would all come back in a heartbeat!!  Our waitress Hannah was super sweet and knew her stuff !!!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the food quality and quantity with very resonable prices.  Had the NY Strip Steak w White Truffle Mac & Cheese and my wife had the Grilled Salmon Blackberry Glazed which both were well prepared.  Service was prompt and always met our needs, would have rather sat toward the back then against the front window.  Restaurant has good ambiance and is decorated nicely considering it is in a strip mall.  Was one of the more enjoyable meals that I have had for sometime."}
{"text":"Unbelievably excellent!!! You don't want to stop eating to talk except to say \"this is soooooo goood!!!  All my husband could mutter was ahhh! The braised ribs were so tender and the lamb both were so flavorful you wanted to ask for bread to consume every little bit of the sauces. The Passion and love for cooking and serving the BEST in food is felt and tasted in every bite. Fritz our waiter made is  so pleasant and enjoyable. His wine recommendation made me almost sing for joy.  You must eat here. You simply need to go relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad lunch here!  The menu always has something new and interesting on it.  I'm one of those people who doesn't order the same thing every time I go to the restaurant.  I have been there multiple times for lunch meetings and they don't try to hurry you out the door to try to turn the table.  Definitely recommend to a friend."}
