{"text":"This restaurant is one of the coolest places in town.  Very modern which my husband and I both LOVE.  Food was great, service was great and we will be definitely coming back.  Keep in mind, this is a new place, so  they may have a couple of quirks to work out, but none that we saw while there. Just be positive and you will have a lovely time."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter and I had lunch here.  We had a good experience. I think they are still working out some of the new restaurant kinks but that's normal.  They brought sourdough bread before the entree and it was great.  I had the burger.  Good flavor but I want expecting it on the sourdough bread. It was cooked just as I asked for it and the quality of ingredients was very good. The steak fries were awesome. My wife's and daughters sandwiches were good also.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  Manager came over and checked on us and welcomed feed back.    I souls like to come back and try the pizza and pasta and also check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Worth every penny!

The staff was amazing and the food was simply perfect. Its obvious they put a lot of thought into the menu. Perfect dinner! Thank you for bringing a piece of the Bay Area to the valley."}
{"text":"We were in the Phoenix area over the weekend and had a delightful dinner at Joey & Gina's. The food was very good. The service excellent and it was a very attractive environment. Will definitely return next time we are in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Found this new restaurant after going to a baseball game at the sports complex. After an unbelievably good dinner I had to post this. 

This is an off-shoot of Original Joe's in San Jose. They are serving an awesome assortment of authentic Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere...clam chowder was to die for, and my Cesar salad was spot on! I had a chicken parm that I couldn't finish, while my buddy had monster pork chops. 

To top it off, don't pass up the desserts. Again, perfectly made with great presentation!

Very friendly staff in a great location right across from the movie theater...give them a try, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Had the pasta primavera and caprese salad for lunch. Quite tasty. Tasteful decor,amazing bar & great service. Our server CJ was good,selling us on other menu items to try next time. We will be back to try the pizza & burgers!"}
{"text":"The music is great. 
The atmosphere is welcoming. 
The food smells fantastic. 
Even more so the food was fantastic!

My service was excellent. I grabbed a few drinks from the bartender, I believe her name was Kelly. She was a lot of fun, very knowledgeable and knew my drink order the moment I sat down. She made pleasant conversation and made my dining experience with JGs that much more enjoyable. 

Overall, I had a great dining experience with this restaurant. Very different from all of the big chains I'm used to around the area.

I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Santa Clara university baseball team just are here. What a place! Great food and great environment. If you are looking for some great Italian food and great people check this place out!"}
{"text":"Eh... Was starving and stopped in here. Food was pricey. And the turkey burger was so salty. The bread sucks so bad!!!!  No drink refills. The desert was good but thats it. Eating outside was nice but id never ever go back here or tell anyone to go. Not worth it at all :/"}
{"text":"Delicious bread and olive oil. Caprese Salad and Strawberry Salad were delightfully refreshing. Then there was the Panna Cotta and the Cannoli.  Superb service and no loud music. Bravo Joey and Gina's!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, restaurant is clean, people are friendly and courteous; what more can you ask for?? I have been there 3 times since they opened (7 days ago) and everything we have tried has been great.  You can ,without a doubt, tell the food is fresh and made in house.  About time the west side got a new fresh restaurant of this caliber.  Perfect for a dinner and movie or dinner before the baseball game."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've had. It took 45 minutes to get our food and half of it wasn't what we ordered. We didn't have drink refills for probably an hour. There were several things (Gaelic bread, honey mustard) that we never even got. My friend ordered a chopped sslad, 2 waiters tried to bring her a cesar and when she finally got the right salad she got no dressing. My other friend gog a burger that did not gave any of the toppings he ordered. He asked for a new burger, this time he got a raw burger with the wrong cheese he couldn't even eat. There have been several places in this location that haven't lasted longer then a year and I don't see this place being the exception."}
{"text":"A month or so ago we saw the new remodel for 'another' restaurant going into this location.  It looked promising so we made a mental note to visit after a movie.  It was  1:30 in the afternoon, was greeted and seated right away by an older gentlemen in the booth section.  I would say there was about 6 booths in our area with customers in all but one.  The place is very beautiful inside and there was three other wait staff that dealt with the other customers or was at the bar.  At no time while we at our table did anyone come by to ask for a drink order....after about 10 minutes or longer I said let's go.  At no time in my 54 years have I ever walked out of a restaurant after being seated.  I hope they do better but feel this place will be like the others before.  Wrong location for the pricey food, will not attract the movie crowd with families."}
{"text":"Lamb Burger & Sweet Potato Fries ($12.95), dinner was amazing and beer was very cold, I will be back..."}
{"text":"Let's start with how cool the place looks, bar is absolutely beautiful !!!!  We had the chicken Parmesan and the rib steak and it was out if this world !!! This is the beat kept secret in Peoria, it won't be long for this place to be off the hook busy!! Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Horrible owners. Closed the restaurant down yesterday with absolutely zero notice to employee's.At 8pm last night we were told not to come in they are closing down for good."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing with very generous portions. There's a great selection not only of pasta, but signature sandwiches and salads too. You can also get pizza or a burger or even an Eggplant Parmesan if you so choose. There's something for everyone, regardless of your taste! There is a full bar and a large open layout. The staff is friendly, extremely helpful, and will always do what it takes to make sure you leave satisfied. I would highly encourage anyone to come in and have a bite to eat at this laid back yet classy restaurant. It's the type of place where you can be just as comfortable in a suit and tie, as in a pair of shorts and a tee. The location is also very convenient with the Loop 101, Peoria ball fields, and a Harkins movie theater mere moments away! Take a break from your busy life and enjoy some down time at Joey & Gina's!"}
{"text":"Well, the fat lady has sung. The place closed up for good tonight. 5.13.2015. Lasted about 90 days. How embarrassing... I have heard many times in my life \"nobody likes a quitter\". And nobody does. It was good while it lasted & a real shame that  not nearly enough forsight, planning & strategy went into this joint prior to opening. Never seen a place  that had so much $$$ thrown at it to get opened close up so fast! But a fool and  their money are ALWAYS soon parted. Tisk, tisk... Arrivaderchie!!! Word to the wise... listen to the lone wolf! Ciao."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The bartender Gary was great. The whole reason we stayed   The owner has the chef make a special cake for our daughter birthday and it was amazing.  The chef even came out and said hello and asked out opinion. The Alfredo was the bomb and the chicken Parmesan was the best i have had. The pizza was good. Wish they were closer to where we are but would drive here to have again."}
{"text":"This is one of the absolute worst restraunts that I have been too in Arizona. The food is just ok, but the prices and the service is very bad. We were with a group of 10, with maybe 10% of the seats in the place taken. It took almost 15 minutes before anyone came over and ask if we needed anything to drink. The rest was down hill. When we were finally served, no one asked if we needed anything or if things were ok. So my wife and I split a Pasta dish and a Cesar solid, one drink a piece...$53.00. We asked for our check, it took 35 minutes to check out. I would understand if they were busy, but no one was there. I will never go back, nor would I recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this accidentally. Nice inside. It was a bit pricier than we expected. We ordered the Ham/Pineapple pizza and house salad. It was pretty good! It was the second night open so the service was not great but not horrible. We shall see how they do after they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Great location, awesome service, amazing food... & for my first time I went easy with the pizza. Loved it!!!! Going back for a classic night again there soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The service was great....ask for Austin's section! Portions are large and taste is great! I would recommend this place!  Oh...a $1 off with your Harkins movie stub."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! I had the egg plant Parmesan it tasted so good, defiantly my favorite. They are also super clean and kid friendly. We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had half stars, because this place deserves 4 1/2! It's clean, stylish, the wait staff is attentive and friendly, the food is great and reasonably priced! And for Mother's day (which was also my mother and I's first visit) they presented her and any other mother in the place with a nice red rose! That was such a wonderful gesture!
Mom had the Tuscan sandwich, which she raved about (shocking because she's very picky about her roast beef) and I had the Lucca burger (again, shocking because I usually don't go for the turkey burgers). This one, however was great! Nice and juicy and flavorful!
The only reason this review is not getting a fifth star is because of two things: when you order a meal that comes with fries you get the choice of sweet potato or regular. I requested regular but got sweet potato. No biggie, especially when the sweet man that brought the food over rushed back to the kitchen immediately to fix the problem. I'm not a fan of sweet potato, but I did try one and it was nice. The regular fries are good too. The other reason is how you enter the place. You can come in from both sides and it can be kind of confusing coming in from the back (you can't tell from outside though), but we were greeted immediately by no less than three employees, so this is just a small ding. 
I hope this place makes it; the location is kind of cursed. No business seems to make it past a year, but if Joey and Gina's keeps up what it's doing, it'll sure make the long haul! Can't wait to return and try other things!"}
{"text":"Austin took the time to explain several items on the menu.  Our meal was amazing! I'll definitely return! If you bring your movie stub you receive $1 off your meal!"}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time last night.
I ordered the steak salad. Yuck!
It was very tough and the lettuce was really soft.
Prices are way too high.  I could understand if the food was good, but it seems as if they're competing with the better restaurants in the area, which this place- is not!
Don't bother eating here, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"An amazing dinner at Joey & Gina's! Found it on yelp and it ends up its part of Original Joe's in San Jose! Amazing!  Love that place and this was great as well. Great chicken parm and meatball and salads!  Defiantly recommend this place and would go back.

Great service as well and one of the owners checked in with us too!



Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant, sweet staff, good service.
The prices are very high better for the east side than the westside. We came in after a movie looking for something light that was easy to walk to.  Across the street was easy. We sat down before looking at the menu.
While what we had was good, the cost brought it down to two stars."}
{"text":"The west valley has needed to step their food game up and start getting people to appreciate good food (mostly found in Scottsdale).  Well, Congratulations to Joey & Gina's for creating a restaurant that is not only well designed, but the Fresh Homemade food puts Scottsdale on notice.  I have been there 3 times already and have a place to bring family, friends and clients.  Nice Job! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great location, love the vibe, and newly opened.  Service was great!  I got the make your own pizza!  Chicken, bacon, red sauce, and mozzarella cheese!!  All the ingredients were fresh and great...  Plus a lot!  The crust of the pizza was a little soggier than I like, but it was good.  We had a great evening...  The others had appetizers too, but I came late and missed happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Clam linguini was great! This place recently opened across from Harkins. Big portions and I like the new furniture. Much better alternative than the generic olive gardens in this area."}
{"text":"i've heard from a few people that this place has closed  and i don't mean just for the holiday.......they never answer their phone, just a message that they can't answer the phone.....and i've called at many different hours.   can anyone shed any light on this?  thanks"}
{"text":"Great service, good ambiance and excellent meal. The chicken parmesan was great
 We'll be back!! $"}
{"text":"Great place for date night or a family dinner. The atmosphere is awesome. Comfortable and modern yet not pretentious. The meatballs are amazing!!!! My boys are super picky and absolutely devoured them. From the mouth of my 9 year old \"this is the best meatball I've ever had!\""}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the portions are huge! You can't go wrong with fresh, handmade, decades-old recipes... and the interior is gorgeous, classy and super comfortable. Joey & Gina's has some of the best Italian food around... and also some of the best burgers and steaks. :) And it's right across the street from the theater; perfect for dinner and a movie!"}
{"text":"Such a great meal! The linguini pesto was amazing. Curtis our server was friendly and willing to answer every question we had, since this was our first visit here. Must have beer on the menu is the Orange Blossom. We will definitely be back to visit again!"}
{"text":"Great location by Harkins Arrowhead. 

Waitstaff was awesome! Super friendly and fast. I really liked the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and the patio. 

Food just fell flat. 

My daughter and I went after a movie and sat outside. However I think my daughter was allergic to whatever potted plants were on the patio. 

Anyhow, onto the food. 

We only had the mozzarella sticks and a pepperoni pizza. The sauce with the fried mozzarella was very flavorful but the cheese was just ok. 

The pepperoni was perfectly spiced and that was only thing good about the pizza. I think it could've used some additional time in the oven as it just seemed soggy in the center. I hate to send food back at a restaurant for obvious reasons so I choked down one piece and my daughter ate most of her slice. We paid the bill and left. 

I don't want to trash the restaurant based on one experience so maybe we'll try again and order an entree instead of pizza :)"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing. the food is great. their steak is delicious. they have a great draft beer menu with plenty of local brews on tap. And their pasta is quite delicious with very generous full portions. Not what you'd expect across from the movie theater but a great gem worth exploring."}
{"text":"The place was pretty nice looking, had a great atmosphere. We were seated fast and they even managed to accommodate 7. The problem wasn't the atmosphere, it was the service. I have never had such terrible service. It took us nearly 1 hour to get our food. Some members of our table got the wrong meal, only to have it taken back and given the wrong meal again. A friend got a salad with no dressing, while another friend got a burger that was barely cooked. Those who got the right meals enjoyed them, but, they were a little too pricey for what they were."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday evening and had no trouble getting a table and being waited on. Service was very hospitable. Staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I had the Sophia pizza with pears on it, and it was very delicious. We finished off with a scoop of Gelato. Overall it was a very nice dinner. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for an early dinner after a movie across the street.  This place has a great location and a nice atmosphere inside. They have some great bubble machines that are fun and relaxing to watch.  We were greeted by a very friendly guy at the door who gave us the history of the place.  Apparently the original restaurant is somewhere in California - I believe by San Fran.  We were seated at a nice booth below three bubble machines.  I'm ready to roll now!

Our waiter was great, friendly, and johnny-on the spot (even though his name wasn't Johnny).  I ordered the house chard which was very nice and a good pour.  My husband a tall whiskey water and our friend a gin and tonic.  Zoom in on the gin and NOT tonic.  It tasted pretty much like gin and water with a nice lime.  Our waiter said he would get her and new one and returned very quickly with a new gin and NOT tonic.  He asked her if she'd like to order something else instead and she opted for a Bloody Mary.  Pretty soon one of the managers returned with a third gin and tonic and said that the bartender was pushing the wrong button.  Our friend was just not ready to go for a third and got the bloody instead.  She said the bloody was strong and good.  

OK - let's move onto the food.  Drum roll......ba dum tsh....  Our friend and I each got 1/2 order of Joey's special which we were told was one of the most popular dishes at the original restaurant.  It was listed on the menu as spinach, eggs and ground chuck sauté with mushrooms.  We were expecting a scrambled egg sauté mixture but when we got Joey's special it was totally green.  Almost all spinach with little bits of egg and ground chuck.  There were big button mushrooms on the top.  The dish was really salty and just way way too green and spinachy.  Our waiter did say that it was not the way the dish was supposed to look.  He graciously took them back and asked if we wanted anything else.  We declined and he took the items off the bill.  My husband got the chop salad with blue cheese dressing on the side.  The dressing didn't really taste blue cheesy but it was OK.  My friend and I were also able to pick a side.  I chose the sweet potato fries which were fine and my friend ordered the ratatouille which she did not care for.  I do not have any details on why but she also left that.

I am surprised that after the first manager brought the third gin and tonic and we turned back some food (very rarely will I ever do that but it was not at all edible) a manager never appeared back to apologize, ask what they could do differently, whatever.  We did not ask to have the meals taken off the tab but our waiter did do that.    

When I look at other reviews mostly 4 and 5 starts I see some pretty positive ones for their Italian entrees. If I go again I would try one of them.  I did notice that many of the reviewers only have a few friends and very few reviews.  I am a bit surprised that some of them were not filtered.  

I'd like to see this place make some changes in the food arena."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. The food and service were both outstanding. Very friendly atmosphere. We'll definitely be back. I had the meat ball sandwich and my wife had a strawberry salad. Oh and we also had the tomato bruschetta. Wow everything was just right. See you soon"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we decided to try this place out.  It was beautiful out, so we sat on the patio and it was enjoyable.  The food was good and the atmosphere was  casual.   I had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was delish. My husband had the lamb burger with sweet potato fries and they were yummy too.  Service was good with one small snafu- all of our food didn't come out at the same time. There was 5 of us and the last thing to come out was a salad and then the dressing took another minute or two. Overall, tasty and we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere ...great service...great drinks...great food!!! I recommend the basil lemon martini...bruschetta and chicken parmigiano"}
{"text":"Sorry, guys...this place is CLOSED. So sad...really liked the food and the service was great. Maybe moved somewhere else?"}
{"text":"What a neat place. We were directed here by our accountants from Sapphire Accounting after doing the yearly business. How pleased we were to have tried this recommendation!
Atmosphere is really nice; casual, trendy, classic Italian ambiance, classy and relaxing all rolled into one.
How impressed were were that the GM stopped by our table to say hello and showed great hospitality. One great star for that. We enjoyed our meal outside on the patio and really have no complaints!
What stood out though? Our server, Austin. Many compliments to him for being a great treat to the evening with both professionalism, great service and a wonderfully humble personality for such a young fella! 
We will return and try more dishes, AND we will be sure to request Austin!"}
{"text":"We went to Joey & Ginas on a Saturday night, not busy at all..I guess that should have been our first clue as to what was to come. We were greeted and seated right away outside in a nice little patio area.  The service was o.k.  The food was not. I ordered pasta, the sauce tasted like it came right out of a can and the noodles were cold. My husband ordered a sandwich. The bread was hard and stale and the meat inside the sandwich was cold, the sweet potato fries were also cold.  It was almost like our food sat for awhile under the lights.  We did not eat more than a few bites.  Our server made mention of why we were not eating, we told her of our disappointment and no need for a box, she did not ask if we wanted to replace it or even have the issues fixed,  she trotted away brought over our bill.. We paid and left. We won't be back."}
