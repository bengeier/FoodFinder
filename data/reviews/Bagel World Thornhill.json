{"text":"I've always been a bagel fan so I decided to drive to this thornhill location for a light lunch.  The place is clean and roomy, seating is comfortable. The server greeted us with a nice smile and took our order...we ordered the Bagels with Cream cheese and lox, flat bagellini with avocado, tomatoes and a potato laktes appertizer.

The cream cheese was generous but the size of the bagel can be bigger. For the flat bagellini it was pretty much standard fare - toasted and pressed with as described ingredients.  The potato latkes was doughie with no potato flavor at all! The meal overall was okay but nothing spectatular. I feel that I could make the exact same at home.

The bill came to $25, which is a little steep for some bagel and cheese.  Will I go back again? Probably not solely based on the value I am getting."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch! Food quality is always good, can't go wrong with the bagels and they are always quick! Good value for the money and truly it's a tasty breakfast. There are long waits so beware of that and keep in mind the service isn't great but it's really to be expected at the local bagel places so if you are in search of good service avoid it here.

I always get the Egg White Greek Omlette and it's always amazing. Coffee is great too and their salads are truly fantastic and large enough to share with 3 people! Greek salad is the best and they don't skimp on the ingredients. Also a tip would be to get the bagel not toasted as they tend to toast it and leave it waiting so it get's to your table cold, or sometimes I ask them to toast the bagel towards the end so it stays warm."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I was over charged for something  and  then the cashier argued with me about the price when there is a huge sign right behind her that says the price. I used to go here at least once a week and will never go back again. Disgraceful!"}
{"text":"While this place might be great during the morning, I just had a bagel now at about 4:45pm and the bagel was hard and tasted stale. Their shelves were empty as well. I guess they were close to closing possibly? I think shops should have fresh food at all times. Tim Horton's has better bagels than this place at ANY time."}
{"text":"the bagels are huge, soft and fresh. Great food for the price. Having cream cheese and lox no one does it better."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place this morning after attending a spinning class just above it. A simple little jewish geared breakfast spot where locks and bagels are served in place of toast and bacon. I like the change!

This place is typical for a greasy spoon breakfast spot, nothing crazy in terms of decore and the staff are you typical diner staff. Not over the top conversational or friendly but just enough to ensure your experience is pleasant. Our waiter was a older gentleman seemingly from eastern Europe. Good dude in my books. 

One of the best things about arriving on a weekday in the morning is the early bird specials. Yes I know that they're meant for the elderly and the those who don't need to be at a job, but heck it was between the weekday 6am - 11am designated time, I was there, and I was hungry!

So what was the early bird special? Well, to be quite honest I haven't experienced that kind of value for my money since my University student days. At the Bagel World, $4.99 will buy you Breakfast special#1 which comes complete with: 2 extra large eggs (they were HUGE), choice of bagel, coffee and OJ or cream cheese. 

The bagel's are a really good quality - I asked for an everything bagel, and the butter they provide for it in a little container is fatty and spreads oh so lovely on the toasted yummyness.

I opted for the Orange juice over the cream cheese, this was a little disappointing as it was literally slightly more than a shot glass worth (2-3 ounces at best). What made up for it was the HUGE cup of coffee, and pretty decent diner coffee at that. 

I'm seldom in this area, but who knows, maybe if I start spinning at the location above more often then I will be here having a bagel and eggs a little more often too. :)


This place merits a 3.5 star in my book, almost a 4, maybe next time we'll bump it up to a solid 4 - looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"What a horrible sad experience we had here... We live in the North Park road buildings and always go to the near by what a bagel for breakfast. We decided to switch things up a bit and try this place. The first impression wasn't bad, we liked how quiet the place is... but we were about to find out why. The waitress was very unpleasant, not a smile in sight. She took our order in a manner that seemed like she was doing us the biggest favour in the world, not like its her job or anything... oh wait a minute it is. 
The food was atrocious! I ordered the Benedict florentine without the hollandaise sauce and could not bring myself to take a second bite. The spinach soaked in oil and undercooked eggs with runny egg whites (even though I asked for medium soft eggs) were just not something I could get myself to consume further. My husband stepped in and switched his meal with me and I ended up eating the mediocre, quite tasteless shakshuka. We also paid extra $2 for added goat cheese that was barely there. 
Not once had the waitress approached us through the entire meal to ask if everything was to our liking. After getting the bill my husband had to go to the waiters stations after waiting for 10 minutes, as again, the waitress did not bother to come back to take the payment. 
When leaving no one even acknowledged us, said thank you, or helped me with the door when I was struggling to get out with a stroller (while my husband was still paying) since the button to open the door wasn't working... Three employees chatting just stared at me until I expressed my annoyance and only then did one of them offer to hold the door. 
Will never come back and will tell anyone who would listen to not waste their money and time in this place!!!"}
{"text":"Ok food
Ok service
Priced well
Overall good value
There is a good freshly squeezed orange juice"}
{"text":"We came to Bagel World Vaughan on Sunday, and was surprised at the spacious seating area adjacent to the take out and bakery area when you come in. I believe this is a newer 'sister' location to the decades old Bagel World at Bathurst and Wilson. Of course, being a Sunday it was relatively sparse and hard to draw a comparitive to the lively southern counterpart. 

We ordered a Bagel World salad for around $12.00 offered good value and came with a bagel. Seemed quite healthy and a good option. I shared a platter of tuna fish, egg salad and cream cheese  with two bagels for about $18.00. it certainly was enough for two people, and ordered an extra bagel so my son could enjoy some cream cheese as well. A tip to the business is to use larger plating for the spreads. 

The grilled cheese at around $7.00, however, seemed pedestrian and lacking in any sides. There was a lonely piece of cucumber which seemed out of place. I think for that price point a side of fries is reasonable. 

As a nice compliment, I ordered some traditional sweets from the bakery countered to have at the table. This was added to the bill. In all with tip was $70.00 for the four of us for lunch. Food was fresh, service attentive, and a nice option for a Sunday treat."}
{"text":"Never again. You had one chance to make a first impression, and you blew it. Met a friend at Bagel World Thornhill for breakfast this week. A sign facing me at the front read something like \"Thank you for eating here\". I hesitated, was ignored by 2 passing servers, stood for a while and then sat down at a booth of my choice ( the restaurant was not busy at the time). After 10 minutes, a server came over and rudely demanded that I get up and go to the front because I could not sit down till she had cleaned the table. Stunned at this customer-unfriendly greeting, I obliged and walked back to the entrance, where there was still no host or hostess in attendance. Servers passed back and forth and continued to ignore me. From the inside the restaurant, the sign I had seen said \"please wait to be seated\". It had been reversed and not noticed by staff, just as I remained unnoticed. At that point, a man, who was seated at a table near the entrance, got up and asked whether I was waiting for a table. I wondered why a patron would want to know so asked him if he was the manager. I explained my frustration and wondered to myself whether Bagel World had anything in their Manager Training Manual that might address such a customer interaction situation. I debated going elsewhere, but as it was merely a seat, a cup of coffee and eggs at stake, I remained and was joined by my friend. We decided that the server's demeanour would become a source of amusement and a story to pass on to others rather than an aggravation. Guys, coffee is coffee - a commodity. There is an overabundance of similar places within 5 minutes' drive from Bagel World Thornhill. My humble advice is that you up your customer service game. Your only differentiator would be a more  pleasant experience. Your coffee is just coffee. Bagels are bagels. Eggs are eggs. Furthermore, no specials were offered by the server. The sign advertising specials was on a wall far from the table and impossible to read at a distance. The prices quoted on the specials sign differ from those on your website (viewed today - May 26, 2018). In my opinion there is no compelling reason to ever return to Bagel World Thornhill. Read other reviews on Yelp, am I alone feeling this way about your service or lack thereof?"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch today with 4 friends and the food was delicious. The eggs and onions are my favorite and they always know how to cook them properly. The service was great although we didnt have a second cup of coffee as they ran out but it was understandable since we came 10 minutes before they closed and they still served us instead of sending us away. Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"As a born and bred Toronto girl living on the border of T-Hill, I figured I would bring the attention to everyone that a new Bagel World is alive and kicking up in Thornhill!

With their Toronto location at Bathurst and Wilson, this amazing bagel stop has spread it wings in the new plaza on Disera, right across from the north facing side of Promenade Mall.

I go to this place with my mom for brunch/lunch often and it always hits the spot! And at a cheap price!

If I go with my mom, we always split the 3 scoop platter!

For $15, you get two bagels of your choice and 3 scoops to top on your bagel.

For the scoops, you can choose from tuna, salmon, egg salad and white fish. These scoops are HUGE and come with a nice selection of cucumbers, tomatoes and red onions to include on your bagel.

Another thing I crave when I walk into Bagel World is their salads! A HUGE Greek or Caesar salad in a bowl as big as your head is around $10. Each salad is packed with veggies and tons of yummy dressing.

And if you do not like something included in the salad, they will take out or substitute things in your order with no problem at all.

For brunch, they have TONS of omelettes with various toppings and ingredient combos.

And for those of you who are like me with a HUGE sweet tooth, they have a bakery in the restaurant, with tons of fresh danishes, cookies and other tasty things you can order to your table or take home after your meal is done.

For all of you bagel fans out there, this place will keep you satisfied."}
{"text":"Great bagels but everything else isn't that great. They always have fresh warm bagels with delicious spreads and toppings. They also have a pretty big selection of non- bagel items: soups, wraps, salads... however the wrap I ordered wasn't good and tasted frozen, so I won't recommend going beyond bagels. 
The server was quite in a hurry to bring out the order and disappeared after, and so have the other servers. Later I saw all of them having lunch together when there were absolutely no servers in the dining room. We had to pay at the take out register because of that."}
{"text":"Good bagels as usual. Love the larg braided ones..."}
{"text":"I love flat bagels. Breakfasts are good. I like bagel cheese and salmon.... It's delicious"}
{"text":"I liked the new Bagel World on Disera Drive. The staff is pleasant and efficient. The bagels are excellent. The prices reasonable.
In addition to  my meal I usually buy a dozen bagels and some excellent rye bread to take home. Besides  street parking there is a large free lot at the back.  All the above deserve 5 stars.

BUT. I cannot abide the place at noon. The noise is deafening. So I go there for an early breakfast about 6:30 am and then stay far away.

Now they have started  playing music and/or TV in the mornings. I am afraid they have lost a customer."}
{"text":"As a bagel/breakfast place that isn't heavy on the meats, this place hits the spot. 

There is plenty of parking and a decent breakfast spot. 

The omelette doesn't look like much, but the flavor is good.

There is a good amount of seating, however service can be a bit spotty, but overall friendly.

The spot is comfortable for a small family to grab a cozy lunch.

Pricing is ok, I wouldn't say it is super one way or the other. 

But it is a great local breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I come here often for breakfast and it's dependable, prices and portions are good for the most part! 

I really enjoy a few items here. They have some good soups depending on the day. I like their tortellini and vegetable soup, i'm not a fan of mushrooms but I hear good things about the mushroom soup too. 

Otherwise i've tried the shakshouka, the tuna bagellinis and have had bagels and other items from the bakery, everything is always fresh and tasty. The prices on some items are a bit high I find, the bagellinis, for example, which are essentially paninis but on a bagel are around $10 or so and they don't come with any side dishes, I find that a bit costly for a sandwich, whereas the shakshouka is about the same price and it comes in a big skillet with a bagel on the side. Maybe the ingredients are more costly in the bagellini, i'm not sure! 

The bagels are really the best part of any meal here. The eggs, sandwiches and soups are good but you come here for a big doughy bagel and you won't be disappointed. You can get scoops of different flavours of cream cheese, smoked salmon, tuna. Salads tend to be very popular, it's not my first choice for breakfast/brunch but they look really good and large in size. 

The service is hit and miss. Sometimes we get a really quick, efficient server, especially since the restaurant can get crazy weekend mornings. Other times we get servers who are quite slow moving and/or difficult to communicate with. As well, i've never had a particularly friendly server here, they're not rude or anything, just more prompt and tend to seem like they're rushing around. 

The restaurant is nice and clean, it looks like a typical breakfast place. I think the space is a bit awkward however, it's hard to get around, especially when it's full of people as the aisleways are narrow and the tables can be quite close together."}
{"text":"The service is spotty but the food is good. Love the Greek salad.  The bagels are great.  The coffee is also better than average."}
{"text":"Bagel World at Bathurst and Wilson is an institution; a pulse-point for Toronto's Jewish community and bagel admirers from around the city. 

Bagel World's Thornhill outpost is a cruel mockery of same; a travesty driven by sdiminished expectations and tastebuds palsied by fresher suburban air. 

The bread is stale. The sandwich fillings are stale. The stale salad lolls limply on the plate.  The stale soup tastes of salt, if you're lucky.  

The service would be better if it were stale. Instead it is rotten. An attempt to follow up regarding an unsatisfactory experience yields an unprintably curt response.  You don't go to a place like this expecting white-glove treatment, but surely you can find a better bagel at a better price, sold by someone who cares to keep you as a customer nearby. 

This isn't exactly a neighbourhood that's hurting for bagels, so why not support a business that deserves it? 

A bagel bought here is not a true bagel; it's a roll with a hole, without any soul."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and that was just the start. When I politely told them that I wasn't happy with it they were very rude, kept interrupting me and became increasingly hostile to the point that they were yelling at me that I got what I ordered and they would be wasting food. Not just the waitress, but the manager. It was surreal. I've never experienced such unprofessional and rude service anywhere. If my mother hadn't already started eating we would have just left."}
{"text":"$4.99 Breakfast with bottomless coffee!!

2 eggs any style with a choice of bagel!

I would definitely come to Bagel World Thornhill for breakfast on weekdays after my spinning class upstairs!

And great for early bird! from 6 AM!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, various deserts a nice plus. Came to get some food to go so can't speak about the service."}
