{"text":"Their burger is the best burger I have ever had!! Can literally have it everyday for the rest of my life  Definitely something everyone must have had at least once"}
{"text":"I LOOOVE this place!!! The King Burger is amazing!! have not had any better!"}
{"text":"The burger is something everyone needs to try, they're to die for. Their signature sauce for the fries is also mmmhhh! Officially my favourite burger joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"The burger is 10ounces of freshly made juicy yummy bliss. It comes topped with onions, coleslaw, tomato and a sauce that I cant quite explain but it made it awesome!! I couldnt even finish it but made sure I brought it home to eat later! The buns, breads, burgers etc are all home made either on premises or in nearby. They have a huge menu of arab food like shawarmas, hummus etc and then the burgers and fries. So so good. I forgot to add that the bun was the softest ever topped with sesame seeds!!   The service was nice and quick as it could be for a freshly made burger. Its a family friendly restaurant so that was a big plus. Its got a private parking lot and plenty of seating. The owner happened to be in that evening and she was really sweet, came over to us to show us what they have and also to ask how we were enjoying the food."}
