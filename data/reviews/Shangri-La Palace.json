{"text":"Two words - turnip cakes!   This place is the best bang for your buck - great Indian, Malaysian and Chinese food - killer laksa and curries.  Highly recommend - the staff here delivered great food and super speedy service."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for weekend lunch buffet $12.95/person.  There's quite a selection to keep most everyone happy, there's dim sum dishes- hagao, shu mai, sticky rice w/ meat...a number of Asian noodles and stir fried dishes including ginger beefs, sweet n sour chicken, mixed veg, etc. and there's also some Malaysian offering including satay chicken, curries and nan!  The only thing I would be critical of is the salt in their soup offerings, the last time we were there a couple of them were quite salty.   It is family run so service is really good, they topped up our tea, came by and took our plates away multiple times and asked how the food was.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try their dinner buffet tonight but it turns out the buffet is only for lunch now.  We were a bit disappointed.  The waitress started bringing out the menus and they had a reasonable Chinese dinner for 6 for $108.  The restaurant was fine with us switching the method for making a couple of dishes and that was the fried shrimp rice (we wanted the basmati rice instead of the Chinese rice - we know they have Indian food during their lunch buffet) and also the chicken dish was a deep-fried chicken and we switched to the cold wine chicken with ginger/garlic oily sauce.  You already know the 2 dishes that came with the dinner for 6 and the other dishes were fish maw soup, lobster in a cream sauce, Chinese broccoli with straw mushrooms, celery, sugar peas and carrots with shrimp and squid, steamed tilapia fish with ginger and spring onions and a Bo-Bo Cha-Cha hot dessert soup.  We thoroughly enjoyed all the food presented to us tonight.  Everything was freshly made and so delicious.  The greens were so green and tender, the seafood so fresh, the chicken so delicious, the fried basmati shrimp rice just right, one word: Perfect!    We've found our Shangri-La!  Will be back for more dinners.  The chef here is so good at what he does!"}
