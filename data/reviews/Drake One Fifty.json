{"text":"I recently went here for dinner and ordered the gazpacho, Drake Salad and the halibut entree. The soup and salad were both simple but fresh. The halibut was cleanly presented and the sauce was well flavored, yet the fish was over cooked and didn't have that flakey texture and buttery mouth feel that well prepared halibut should. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is trendy but relaxed and the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Overall, it was a decent meal but none of the dishes were close to being a \"Wow\". The prices leaned towards the expensive side."}
{"text":"3.7
Just shy of four stars IMO. 
The Staff were verrrrry nice,polite and accommodating. That's always a ++++
-Drinks , usual nothing Special. 
-Food mehhhh, $14 for three meatballs, the sauce tasted like it was sittin around all day. 
-Calamari App , the sausage in the dish saved it. 
-Pizza was tasty good size and flavor. 
-Music by resident DJ ,great job.
-Good space,  Adequate lighting and perfect music volume. 
 I would return or recommend for drinks and wouldn't rave too much about the food."}
{"text":"Loud!! Lively and upbeat atmosphere, but very loud.  The corned beef sandwich was very good - excellent bread and hot mustard with crunchy, tangy sauerkraut.  My lunch companions had the burger, the steak frites and the pickerel and all were pronounced very good.  Service was efficient and pleasant.  Judging from how busy the place was, I would definitely suggest making reservations.  This visit was for a business lunch, but I think it would be a much better place for drinks after work."}
{"text":"slooooooow service and mediocre food. 
our table had the pepperoni pizza (would not recommend), burger (average), and the drake salad (way too small and the resto should have a dinner size option). 
i will say the fries are yum and taste like mcdonalds. 
a little overpriced for the quality. not comparable to other drake locations."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and an app. Love the decor. It's great place for a date night.  Not many options for a typical appetizer. We ordered the Hawaiian pizza and it was awesome. Drinks were a little expensive. Overall would recommend this place for something different."}
{"text":"Cute bartenders! 

Never had food here but the bartenders are cute and funny. 
Drinks are good. 
Warm olives are good.

I come here for drinks and people-watching."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this restaurant. The first time it was me and my 3 girlfriends and we had a good time. The cocktails were nice and the food was good. We shared their famous lobster pizza! On the second visit, I was looking forward to ordering the lobster pizza again, however it wasn't on the menu. When I asked the waitress why not, she said that because it was so popular, the chefs decided to take it off the menu. Um.....makes no sense!!! They replaced it with tuna!  So anyway, we got ceviche to share (not bad - small portion though) and then halibut for the main. The portion size was good for the price (wasn't cheap either), but it was a bit too salty for me. Dessert was my favourite part. It was a chocolate type mousse/cake. Not too sweet and very nicely presented. A cocktail that I got (The Piccadilly) was also nice. Atmosphere is good (they have a live dj playing music). It's a nice place to go for drinks but not food. If I were to go back, it'll be only for drinks."}
{"text":"I get it - it's in the financial district and is catering to the suits, but still, $9 for a handful of olives?!

The Drake One Fifty is one big contradiction to me. The décor is reminiscent of a \"Cheers\" type watering hole (though in all honesty it looks more like the rundown pub in Terminal 3 at Pearson Airport) yet the menu prices are on-par with Canoe. The hip-factor and laid back attitude of the original Drake Hotel is nowhere to be found, instead this place just feels like a blatantly obvious attempt at cashing in on the Bay Street expense accounts. Pretty tacky really."}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk in is the Decor. Just beautiful. And the vibes are on point. I've been there twice and In  both times the service has been good and the food was amazing. From presentation to taste"}
{"text":"The brunch is really lovely, and possibly the best I've tasted in Toronto. Their eggs benedict offers a modern and unique take on this classic dish. The rosti is seasoned perfectly and cooked to crispy perfection. The lemon white chocolate eclair is delightful; I highly recommend this one if you have a sweet tooth. 

The price is higher than most brunches, but a perfect spot for special occasions. This place is popular and very crowded during the week, but on Saturdays it is quiet, peaceful, and the service is spectacular."}
{"text":"Super cool vibe with great food and service. A bit overpriced but perfect for meetings with a trendy client. 

I always get the margherita pizza since their vegetarian options are limited. My meat-eating friends claim the specials are really good.

Service can be slow at peak hours. Overall its a nice addition to the business district."}
{"text":"We had a Sunday brunch here on a whim. Nice interior--eclectic style. We ordered the blueberry scones to share--delicious! I had eggs Benedict and husband had a mushroom omelette--both were great. There was a 4-pc jazz ensemble playing that morning--nice touch. This would be a fun night time eatery too."}
{"text":"This week the iconic Toronto landmark, The Drake Hotel, opened its sister restaurant, bar and art space- the Drake One Fifty.  Located right in the heart of the financial district, the 6,000 square foot space was carefully designed by esteemed British decorator Martin Brudnizki and then further accented by a unique art collection and the creative work of Brothers Dressler.
The vibe keeps with it's sisters' vintage post-modern tavern vibe, but feels a little bit more sophisticated and chic to fit the business suit clientele.
For summer power-hours and after work dinners and drinks, the Drake One Fifty showcases a covered urban patio landscaped by awarding designer, Joel Loblaw. Inside, you immediately see a mini \"Drake Store\", a small alcove stage for live music and a vintage photo booth for late night fun.  The real showstopper, however, is the 60-foot oval marble bar that provides a convivial atmosphere for mingling and people watching with a drink in hand.
Speaking of drinks, expect to see sophisticated cocktails like the Suppressor #21 (Cynar, Barolo Chinato, Sherry, Orange Bittesr, $13), the Baller Manhattan (Colonel E.H. Taylor Whisky, Carpano, Antica Vermouth, Angostura, $14), and the French 75 (Hennessay Cognac, Lemon, Sugar, Prosecco, $14).  There's also a hand-selected list of local and international wine offerings available in 6 or 9 oz pours ($10-26) or by the bottle ($40-95) and of course a handful of local and international bottled beers. You can also bet you're boots that like its Queen W venue, One Fifty will be open late for your drinking desires.
Just past the leather lounge tables and banquettes that overlook York St is the large open-kitchen style dining room.  With a seamless flow from the bar area to the full dining room, here you can comfortably watch the action in the kitchen, the buzz at the bar, or simply just enjoy your companion's company. It's obvious that the Drake One Fifty would make for one heck of an impressive date night out.
Complementing its flirty décor is a fantastic menu developed by Executive Chef Ted Corrado. Ted has put together a fairly extensive dinner menu that embodies the Canadian brasserie experience. Here's an overview of some of the dishes we tasted Blistered Shishito Peppers: Cherry Tomatoes, Sea Salt, Crispy Garlic ($9)
Scallop Crudo with Preserved Lemon, Kohlrabi, Black Olive Reduction, Puffed Rice ($17)
Seafood Platters with Oysters, Clams, Mussels, Shrimp, Lobster, Calamari, Snow Crab ($150)
Talk about luxurious!
Raddichio and Burrata Salad: burrata, Mache, Black Garlic Dressing, Macona Almonds ($17)
The creamy burrata with the slightly bitter leaves was a winning combination.
Forager Pizza : Fior de Latte, Rampes, Wild Mushrooms, Pecorino ($22)
Beef Tartare: Cubraes Sirloin, Tomato Puree, Pickled Shitakes, Egg York and Potato Chips ($16)
Deliciously rich and tangy tartare on a nicely seasoned crispy chip.
Roast Lamb: Greek Yogurt, Roasted Baby Eggplant, Citrus New Potatoes, Haricot Verts, Chili Puree ($28)
Favourite dish of the night- loved the crispy exterior of the lamb and it's juicy tender meat, especially with the spicy chilli puree and the creamy yogurt.
Whole Rotisserie Chicken: Leeks, Potato, Carrots, Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Chicken Jus (for 2 people, $40)
Lemon Meringue Pie ($9)
The Drake One Fifty is located at 150 York St (at Adelaide St W) and is open for business starting October 2nd with hours Monday to Wednesday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Thursday and Friday 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., Sunday 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.  It's conveniently located at the Adelaide Place entrance of the PATH, and there is parking underground for only $7. And while I may work from home and rarely visit the financial core, the Drake One Fifty is looking like the hot spot this season I'd make a special downtown field trip for.

{"text":"Nice spot, you can never have enough places to go for after work drinks! I guess the target demographic is hipsters with jobs? Hehe.

Tip: Avoid the old fashioned... to me, an old fashioned is whiskey forward. For whatever reason, at Drake One Fifty, it is light/cream coloured and tastes more vanilla than anything else. Odd."}
{"text":"One of my favourite new restaurants in the city!  The food is made from exceptional ingredients and is reasonably priced, especially for the quality.  The wine and cocktail list shows imagination and innovation.  The room is beautiful and has a great buzz.  All of the servers are lovely, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive!  Kudos guys!  Keep up the good work!  Maybe lose the Canadian tuxedos that the poor staff has to wear ;)"}
{"text":"I came to Drake One Fifty on a date and sat in the art-decorated cove area to the West of the bar. Right off the bat, we were loving the tunes that the DJ was spinning. Also, just putting it out there that the decor of this restaurant is stunning; carefully thought out, and full of heart and style.

To start:

Beef Tartare - When I see tartare on a menu, that's always my go-to and DOF did not disappoint! A mix of gherkins, caper leaves and mustard really gave this dish a refreshing twist. We loved it! 

Cavatelli Verde - The server was kind and walked us through the menu. There were several sophisticated ingredients that we were not familiar with and she was able to describe in detail dishes we might like. I went with the Cavatelli Verde - a vegetarian home made pasta, with pumpkin seed pesto and lemon ricotta. Very refreshing. 

Lamb Torchetti - My date had the Lamb Torchetti pasta. He had tried a similar dish at JUMP a few months prior and was so excited to try a dish similar to the one he had over there. Well, this pasta exceeded his expectations. The lamb was shaved and served over home made pasta and lamb broth. I tried some - it was amazing! He said DOF lamb pasta wins, hands down. 

I should also note that our server assisted us with the wine list as well. I normally drink a Malbec so she recommended the Monastrell, a beautiful red from Spain, that was reminiscent of a Malbec.

For dessert we opted for 2 lattes, and a macaron each. A lovely way to end our evening. 

I would absolutely 100% recommend Drake One Fifty for any occasion! Make sure to stop by the photo booth on the way out!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for dinner on a Tuesday night, the place was packed! As a result, it's a pretty loud dining environment. Our table decided to share a bunch of dishes between the four of us, 6 appies turned out to be more than enough. 

The meatballs (3 large/order) are light and flavourful in a tomato sauce. The brassicas seemed like an odd thing to order, who needs a plate of Brussels sprouts and broccoli when they go out for dinner? They were delicious, if only all veggies tasted like that! The crispy cauliflower is to die for, dusted in cornstarch and lightly fried, it was crispy tender with the most amazing sauce. The beet salad was also delicious as was the fresh fish crudo, although the latter was way outside my usual culinary comfort zone.

We also ordered a burger and fries, just in case all the veggies weren't enough (they were!). The burger itself was tasty but the fries are on the thin side and looked a little over cooked to me, although they did get eaten.

There's a great selection of wines by the bottle, by the glass was a little less inspiring."}
{"text":"Started from the Drake Hotel now we are here. When I heard about Drake Hotel's October very own restaurant opening in the financial district, I couldn't wait to see if the place would be successful because as far as new Toronto eateries nothing was going to be the same with all the new places opening up in the area and Drake150 grabbing all the headlines.  I went here for lunch, and although it took a little bit long for the food to come out, the service staff took care of us and were all really friendly, even though I wasn't looking for new friends. I had the $21 burger, and although it wasn't the best I ever had, it was still pretty good. My friend had the half bird, which was fried right, but could have used some diced pineapples on the side. Overall, the place does look great with some cool artwork and some nice tuscan leather chairs around the long bar. I would say it's a so far gone conclusion that I will be back again."}
{"text":"Had my birthday brunch here on a Saturday. I ordered french toast (one of the best I've ever had) with mascarpone, pistachio cream and figs. It was amazing. My guests ordered the eggs benedict and also really enjoyed it (one regular and one with smoked salmon). The in house smoked salmon was nice but just slightly over done. The ambience and service was fantastic. It was pretty busy, I would recommend making a reservation. We didnt have to wait long for our food even though it was busy. The photo booth is a really nice touch! I had a fantastic time and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I like this place. It has a cool bar vibe and a great location. Even though it's more of a bar, the food is great. They went out of their way to give us great service and found a way to accommodate 5 guys who showed up with a reservation for only 4. Good wine list and food varieties."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good here however the service was awful! I was here for lunch. I got seated at 1:00 pm and  ordered shortly after. I waited a good 40 minutes for the food the arrive, during which time the restaurant cleared out significantly. I had to flag down the waiter to get his attention to the fact that our food was still not served. He basically brushed me off saying that it was coming shortly. He did not come back to check up on the meal or drinks. Nor was any one around when we had to pay. Considering the restuarant was basically pretty empty by the time we left, this was pretty unacceptable."}
{"text":"I often come here because it's a convenient meeting spot for folks in the financial district and it's not as stuffy as some other restaurants in the area. The cocktails are expensive, but they have a cute patio, reliable mains and fun snacks."}
{"text":"Unbelievably poor service... My party of 5 was served half an hour ago and I still don't have my meal. I expected better of this place!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place - the decor is great, very eclectic with interesting weird art on the walls, and the service was good.  

My favourite appetizer was by far the brussel sprouts which were delicious, and the pizza for the main course had a nice thin (but not too thin) crust.  

Items I liked less were the cauliflower (bland), and the calamari (chewy).

The vibe in the place is also good, and different for the financial district."}
{"text":"Went last night for their guest chef. I also went once about a month ago. The place simply tries too hard and can't quite execute. Almost everything I've had both times (curried cauliflower, sweetbreads etc the first time) the pre fixe menu the second was way over salted. Service was really slow. Had to wait forever for the check to show up at the end, food came out before our drink orders were even taken. Waitress was a little snotty when we asked for bread \"we have a side order or loaf.\" \"how big is the loaf?\" \"I don't know it's a loaf.\" 
Finally, I get that it's a lounge or whatever, but the music is the perfect combination of terrible and loud. Pretty impossible to talk to each other about how mediocre the food was."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I popped in for lunch this week and enjoyed the buzz. There is a great vibe in this place. We shared roasted duck wings and beef tartar to start. The wings were a bit lean which made them a little dry but the sauce was Delish. We were super excited about the tartar as it was advertised to have been from Cumbraes. However it fell a little flat. The pickle and sauce combo was reminiscent of a Big Mac. 

We shared the Pizza Verde and it was the best part of the meal. The fresh shaved asparagus and preserved lemon and ricotta made the perfect combo. I could eat it again tomorrow. Perfecto"}
{"text":"I am sorry unless you like \"noise\" this is not the place for you. Jammed tables, average food, artificial glad-handing.... waiter kept asking if food is fine..if wine is fine.
Will not be going back except for a drink at the bar with ear-plugs"}
{"text":"Service is excellent! Our waitress was very attentive. Drinks are good. We went on a less busy day for dinner and didn't have to make reservations. We were seated immediately in the patio. We ordered from the fall dinner menu. My husband ordered the Drake One Fifty burger with fries and he had no complaints. I ordered the halibut. The fish itself was amazing! It came in a bowl with a pho based soup. I love pho so I thought I would have really enjoyed this combination together but the soup had a very bitter taste to it. I probably wouldn't order that again because of its bitterness."}
{"text":"As far as \"beautiful-people-having-after-work-cocktails-and-dinner,\" its hard to beat this place.  Nice interior, excellent bar staff (with constantly evolving selection of house cocktails, all excellent) and quite decent food.  In warmer months, the patio is quite nice as well.

Really the only mark against this place is that it can get very loud and therefore hard to carry on a conversation across a table, especially when the DJ starts."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and I tasted a couple of platters which were both reallyyyy good..thumbs up"}
{"text":"Party of four on a Wednesday night. We felt like nibbling on a variety of dishes so we ordered the following: fritto misto, Nonna's meatballs, shishito peppers, the sharing porterhouse with mushroom risotto and fries and leafy greens as sides. 

I don't think there were any dishes that stood out to me. Shishito peppers aren't something you see a lot of and they had a nice kick but really just tasted like any peppers. The porterhouse was def two inches thick and cooked pretty well. We got it medium rare and it came as expected with the ends a bit more well done.  The mushroom risotto was bizarre. The \"rice\" were the texture of normal rice but they were as big as corn kernels! 

The leafy greens were hilarious. $8 for once sliced king mushroom and maybe 3/4 cup of cooked greens. It was insanely salty and when I mentioned this to the waiter, he said yes, that is because of the white anchovy sauce. Ooook. So the over-saltedness is a feature of the dish? 

Dessert was pretty good. We had the daily pie which was almost like a sugar pie with some earl grey ice cream on top and a pile of fancy spun sugar. 

$280 for the above + 5 drinks before tax and tip. The food was pretty and the room was nice... But there are a ton of other places I would rather go to with more interesting food."}
{"text":"1) Two creepy men as greeters. Not the best first impression ~ should rethink that
2) good wine selection and decent cocktail selection 
3) there's a photo booth,  super cool!
4) waiter works hard"}
{"text":"I had a great experience last time I came here. I was really turned on by the hot ass barbacks, so I came back to see if there was any fresh meat... and there was!!!

I put on a sexy low cut dress just incase I caught the attention of one of them. They are always so HOT and are always working so HARD. God I was turned on (about a 9/10).

I walked past the glass washer and saw a NEW BARBACK! He was SO HOT. He looked like a cross between Michael Cera and that nerdy guy from Criminal Minds. 

I was so nervous I made a blubbering fool of myself! I wanted any excuse to talk to him, so I asked him where the bathroom was. He stopped polishing and smiled at me, my heart melted. He said, \"It's right there.\" As he pointed to the door behind me.

I sat in the bathroom thinking about a time not so long ago where heads would turn when I entered a room. All of the men would lust after me, and now I am getting older and am losing my desirability.

Will I ever love again?"}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place and the restaurant is definitely better than most in the financial district.  I'd probably give it a 3.5 but bumped it up since our server was really great.
The prices are a bit steep for lunch especially if you want to order a cocktail, if you have to pay out of pocket.
The food is good though and the service was excellent so no complaints there. The pasta portion size was a bit small but my friend loved it.  I had the carbonara pizza and it was delicious!!!  I would highly recommend that.
I would recommend this place as it is definitely better than most of the restaurants in the financial district for a sit down lunch.
I've also been here for drinks after work and it gets pretty busy - good place to go for drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is quite expensive and the quality of food or service does not match the price they charge. I ordered the Eggplant Croquettes and it was one of the least tasty foods I have ever had in Toronto. It was unhealthy and tasteless! The service was really bad and I didn't like the ambiance."}
{"text":"Save your money.  This place was a huge disappointment it would be better as a breakfast diner."}
{"text":"TLDR; okay brunch centrally located in the financial district, but kind of overpriced for what you get.

Their scones are good but you only get 4 very small pieces for $11. I got the drake breakfast which was good but not amazing. The portion size was pretty big though. I got it mainly for the cornbread, which was good. The rest of the dish was pretty ordinary. Not really worth $19 though in my opinion. 

The location is great though and the inside of the restaurant is nice. Service was pretty slow. I recommend making a reservation because it gets pretty busy for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"We were seated and waited 15 before having to ask the host if we could have water and a server.  The food isn't what bothered me, although I found it to be overpriced for the quality. Not even our dismal waiter ruined the experience for me. It was the overall lack of costumer service not only from the waiter but also from the manager. After waiting 45mins for the food to arrive, then constantly asking for water, syrup, utensils, etc. which took and additional 20 mins, my friend was served raw food.  When speaking to the manager she brushed off our concerns and said it was not their policy to comp checks. Really?? Never once did we ask or expect our check to be comp. We were just expressing our concerns about the service.  I'm not sure if it was because we were young or of color or a combination of both or this is just how they treat their patrons but needless to say it was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to drake one fifty yesterday for our date night. It was between this and patois, but since patois was booked we decided to go here. Been wanting to go for a while now! The ambience and decor is good, it even has a cute little photo booth.  The menu apparently changes every so often so we had the fall menu. We ordered goat ravioli which was pretty good but serving was super small. My fiance has the drake one fifty burger and he loved it. 

I didnt like the fact that the drinks were super expensive. We re talking $15 for one. All in all the food was alright but service and ambience was better."}
{"text":"Went to check out Drake One Fifty before committing to a large group lunch I am planning.  Great location and nice decor.  A bit loud, but I didn't really expect it to be a quiet place.  Server was helpful in choosing a drink.  Ordered the Rabbit Carbonara.  Yikes!  Terrible.  Pasta was underdone (not even al dente), temperature was not good, and the combination of unidentifiable vegetables was confusing.  When I see carbonara, I expect simple... cream, cheese, egg, peas, pepper.  Far too much going on.  Was inedible.  The server did not ask me how my meal was and the (full) bowl was taken away by another server without question.  I did not want to complain as I was in mixed company (and sometimes one must just keep their mouth shut).  However, when the server asked if I wanted dessert, I told him I have to go get lunch somewhere.  He did not hear me for some reason... probably the level of noise in there.  This restaurant has potential, but the menu was limited and uninspiring.  It's really a shame.  Will go back for drinks, but it needs to earn me back for a meal."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for some after work drinks and appetizers. If you don't work in the financial district, you will immediately notice you are surrounded by suits. The crowd actually gives it a cool vibe - kind of like a work hard play hard feel. 

It was a wednesday evening around 6pm and the place was pretty jammers - we ended up sitting at a high table in the bar area which we didn't mind. Our server was very charming and adorable - he was informative and humorous at the same time. He made great recommendations for us and was very attentive, asking us if we wanted another drink when our drinks were getting low. 

We ordered the house cured charcuterie and the cheese plate. We thought it would just be a snack but it was enough to be our dinners. The meats on the charcuterie were all beautifully arranged and looked very appetizing, as were the cheeses. Both tasted great! 

I will definitely return to try more of the items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was super eager to have a meal at the Drake One Fifty, so when we decided to go out for dinner before an event, I immediately made a reservation without checking if it was okay with my dinner guests. Thankfully, it was an excellent experience and everyone in my party was more than happy. 

The atmosphere at Drake One Fifty is great; really quirky art on the walls, a great bar, and comfy booths. I had the lobster roll and it was amazingggg (and worthy of the extra g's for emphasis). The fries were equally as good; I'm not ashamed to say I finished the whole serving. Though we didn't have any alcohol, we did partake in dessert, sharing the Chocolate and Apple Crumble. Both were amazing and I dream about them nightly ever since. 

The service was also friendly and prompt; we were greeted immediately by a lovely hostess and the waiters we came in contact with were just as welcoming! We'll definitely be back; we've added the pizza to our list of must try foods."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Tatar, and the burger is pretty good. It's a bar and grill, but excellent food when put into that category."}
{"text":"Consistent good food in the financial district.  Decent for drinks and group events.  Can get noisy on a typical weeknight.  The burger is always a good option."}
{"text":"This past Thursday I finally checked out the drake one fifty and well it was... meh.  I am a huge fan of the drake hotel and have had several great nights out on the roof down to the underground.  Also I have had great company functions at the drake hotel.  Unfortunately I am severely disappointed with one fifty.  The minute we walked in it screamed douche-baggery.  I'm sorry but the suits and massive pick up joint killed it for me.  It was just like any other bar in the area.  It was amazingly loud. Like too loud but nothing that could be controlled I guess.  Food was ok.  Seating was cramped. Service was decent.  Washrooms... The button flushers are behind the lid to the point where you have touch the lid of the toilet in order to get to flusher.  GROSS.  Then I had to touch a faucet to wash my hands.  I don't know but in this day and age why am I touching the faucet for water? 

Overall, every minute I was there I was sad to have cancelled my reso's at Chase.  Won't be going back. unfortunately it's just not my scene.  Thanks god for the original drake hotel!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner after work with some friends. I had the Pepperoni pizza - the best part was the white anchovies, a nice touch. Nothing else really stuck out in my mind ether way, except that I know I've had better cooked dough in other places in the city for less money. 

The atmosphere and decor was drake one fifty was cool, and the wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"This location has really creative dishes and very unique combinations.  That makes it a bit difficult, however, for a first timer to be sure of what he or she is getting.  Nonetheless, it's a really hip-cool place to hang out and get a drink after work.

The food was great and the environment was even better.  Unfortunately, the bill did not reflect the place.  Higher quality food, larger portions, and better decor can be had for the same price somewhere else.  Again, nothing to be crazy about but yet a place definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Well it's trendy, guess this is why people are attracted to it ? The decor looks more delicious than the actual food. Don't order the chocolate cake, it was $8 but tasted like grocery store cake, sorry for the harsh words. For the same price point, Terroni franchises probably have a better quality control?! The $5 latte was fine I suppose. But, overall? Overpriced for what it is and will pick another place to go next time."}
{"text":"A group of five of us went to Drake 150 for dinner last night, it was terrible on every level. Slow to get drink orders, slow food service, mains coming 15 min after others got theirs, and some dishes weren't even hot anymore. To cap it all off , they charged us 50cents additional for mayonnaise on my $21 dollar hamburger . 
I dine out in the city at least 3 nights a week, this is the worst experience I have had in years."}
{"text":"I will write this review with a disclaimer that I have NOT been there in the afternoon/evening (when the place seems to be hopping) but rather during lunch - so my experience may have been different than other reviewers.

Heard of this place several times and eventually my buddy and I decided to try it for lunch. Reservations highly encouraged as it gets packed. Nice decor, an interesting combo of high-level executive restaurant crossed with some hipster/yuppie feel to it - but not overdone. While not big on the latter element - they did it relatively tastefully.

The eye opener was the menu. The prices were borderline ridiculous. Actually sorry, they were ridiculous. But then again, ate in several other pricier places and my mantra is  - the moment you charge so much, I expect an incredible culinary experience. Decided to hit hard with the boar pasta and a glass of Chianti. Heard they make their own pasta - so that was something that got me to order this.

When it arrived - disappointing. I know boar is not the most tender meat but the sauce made with ground boar was really rough. The pasta was heavy (almost too floury if you ask me) and cooked way too al dente (I love al dente, but not to the point that it is sticking to my teeth). The flavor was good but felt like I was chewing through rubber every time I took a bite. The heavy pasta made me feel so bloated afterwards that I couldn't touch any food the rest of the day. Overall a bad combo to serve a tough meat with tough pasta that is cooked too al dente. My friend had the same and he had the exact same feeling about the food.

Service was fast and courteous. The decor is nice and good atmosphere with working professionals and no weird characters. But the relatively poor meal experience, coupled with horrible prices (for the pasta, with a 6oz glass of wine and no dessert, paid $50) ensures that I do not give this place more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Brunch was amazing! Taste great and service was pretty good. Everything taste good so couldn't recommend something one over the other.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying brunch here. When I walked in I was immediately impressed by the decor. Service was slow. I ordered the omelette which came out half cooked. My server was happy to send back and have re-cooked which I appreciated. I ordered another coffee whilst waiting and I was astonished when I received the bill that the cappuccino's, which were surely from a Nespresso machine, cost $5.50+tax. Probably won't have brunch here again as it is overpriced."}
{"text":"We were seated and waited 15 before having to ask the host if we could have water and a server. Our dismal waiter didn't bother me. Waiting 45mins for the food was a bit annoying. I ordered pancakes and they gave me 2 for $15. Seriously? They were quite delicious but not very filling. They brought me a third and it was all batter on the inside! They did comp my mean but decided that since the rest of my party ate their whole meal a discount wasn't warranted even though we waited over an hour for food and had to constantly ask the hostess for water and syrup."}
{"text":"Seriously slow service here. Been here twice in the past month and it was the same story. Both times on the patio as well. And very little was done to acknowledge that it was slow either, other than a sorry and small appetizer taken off the bill. Brunch shouldn't take 2 hours, but it did. If you're bent on going here, be prepared to wait it seems. Not worth the $$, nor the time. There are plenty of other options up the street, down the street, and across the street."}
{"text":"Sat outside on a nice Saturday evening - had an early dinner before heading to the ballet. The service was efficient and friendly, and the food was very tasty. Both My sister and I enjoyed our shared appetizer and our mains. She had the lamb ribs, which ended up being a huge portion but very tasty. It definitely went home with her. I had the duck, and was very pleased. In all, a great pre-ballet dinner experience."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks but this place is overhyped! 

Came in for a birthday celebration and this place was packed. Good thing I didn't have to wait long before my guest were seated since we booked a reservation in advance.

The food was pretty disappointing for a high end restaurant/bar. Their drink menu is pretty good in my opinion. I usually just get my usual wine and cocktails. I don't expect them to have anything too crazy on their drink menu.

Overall the ambiance was great. But it was not as good as how hyped it was in their marketing and pictures posted on social media!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch and the atmosphere was really great and the bar chairs super comfy that makes you actually want to sit there. I'm super wierd and also love when chairs don't have holes at the back so incase my top rides up there's nothing to worry about in terms of giving others a show. Just me ? That's fine. Anywho we had wine and a coffee with baileys. Ask for the baileys ordered separately as its cheaper not like the clientele here probably care as they expense their meals. Cool photo booth at the side of the bar. So much to look at and an amazing soundtrack. To eat we split the burrata salad and then she had the brisket sandwich and I had the Hawaiian pizza. The jalapeño peppers on the pizza were super hot so I took them off but I'm also not big into spice. Her brisket sandwich was huge and she didn't even finish half of the meal. Overall the only complaint was the inability to find our server and we had to get back to our offices and I had to flag her down for the bill. FYI each of us paid $50 plus tip for our meals so for those entry level people out there like us be prepared to cry ha"}
{"text":"Have done business lunch here on a couple of occasions and both times exceeded me expectations.

Food is fresh, well executed and menu is not uninspired. Enjoyed oysters, epic brisket sandwich, incredible brussel sprout appetizer (I want to know how they cook it!). Meh on the fish sandwich.

Appreciate staff being able to accommodate request to instantly bring out an appetizer, and recommend something that came out quickly.

Decor is cool and eclectic, but music slightly too loud.

Will come back."}
{"text":"Drinks & apps

Food, ambience & value: 3/5

Service: Friendly

Repeat: Perhaps.  We didn't try any cocktail or order any of the more creative apps, or mains. So should return to properly assess. But somehow don't feel compelled, unlike I do with Drake Devonshire (although I suspect the food & bev are better here)."}
{"text":"Went to Drake One Fifty for brunch on a Sunday. It was not easy to reserve a table for two (they had events where people booked the whole restaurant) for brunch. 
I got shakshuka which was pretty good. My fiance got their signature breakfast dish. We both thought that his dish was better. This was my first time having shakshuka though so I can't compare it to anywhere else's, but it was good. We also ordered cocktails which I think were a bit overpriced. 
I noticed that some people were there just to have coffee or a snack (not necessarily a full meal). This place is very cozy and comfortable especially with the way they have their bigger tables.
Considering the hipe around Drake One Fifty when it opened, I was a bit disappointed. This place is like any other decent restaurant in Toronto, there is nothing extra special about it. But the food was good, and the service was attentive, and the food prices were fair. Would I go back for brunch? Maybe. But I will definitely be back if I am meeting someone for a snack or have something to do in the area and need to kill time."}
{"text":"Great vibe, fun photo booth, great decor, excellent service and that duck liver Drake Toast? Oh.My.Gosh....."}
{"text":"One of my favourite after work bay street area bars. 

Expect a lot of suits after 5pm but ideal time to come is on a weekend during the day when there is not that much of a rush, especially now with the cooler weather.

Meatballs and Calmari are great to snack on which is usually as far as i get before moving on.

Service can be slow at times but the theme of the bar is pretty cool, bit of a cross between a bistro and an american diner. not sure what they are actually going for but i like it."}
{"text":"Cocktails were delicious.  Service was OK.  Best burger in Toronto hands down!  If you go you have to try the burger!  The bun, the cheese and the meat go perfect together.  And the fries, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I can't say tgat Drake 150 knocked me off my feet, it's an ok experience. The music was way too loud (or maybe it's just me getting old), we had a hard time hearing the waitress. 

As for the food, I had tartare that was mixted with \"fruit ketchup\", let's say it's far from what I expected. The other dishes were good, nothing spectacular.

Other options will be evaluated next time, but at least, it's walking distance from my hotel."}
{"text":"I came here for my 18th birthday dinner and i had a great time with friends. I wanna address the issue head on by saying that service is quite slow, I understand that the place gets quite busy and that certain staff are assigned to certain tables for commission purposes?? But maybe its because my friends and I are teenagers and thats how people often treat us in public, I just felt under appreciated as a customer. The host was very friendly, and our waiter was patient with our order. But I find the rest of the staff had a tendency of glaring at us or if I raised my hand to just get refills on water they would stare but wouldn't take any action. 

Food wise, they season their fries well. I really wanted to try the chicken wings but they ran out that night. I had the spaghetti and i found it the tad bit underwhelming because in terms of taste it only had that extra bit of pork fat taste. I had some friends who got the burger and said they enjoyed it. Another friend got the Boar chop, he really enjoyed it. My boyfriend got the hawaiian pizza and added mushrooms and jalapeños peppers and he felt satisfied too. 

For those who want to celebrate a birthday or anniversary here, unfortunately, they dont give you complimentary cake like most places. They charged me for my cake without telling me and when we asked about it they just say they help put a candle on it. The cake was delicious though. Instead for birthdays you get a voucher to use for their photobooth."}
{"text":"I am a senior and was travelling alone to see the ballet and was interested to see The Drake had a restaurant nearby and planned to go.  I was there for lunch on a Saturday.  Absolutely the best overall experience in a long time.  Wonderful service, great table location, the food and recommended wine were perfect.  The decor, what I would expect from the Drake.  Kudos on all levels.  Next time in Toronto will absolutely choose to go there.  I often travel to Picton and absolutely love The Drake Devonshire .. the food, the decor, the table tennis room, all at the waters edge.  Another must go place in Wellington, and you can stay there too!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with wife & toddler.  It's great they have live music, but it's incredibly loud such that it makes it more difficult to enjoy conversation.  For our boy, it was a combination of \"yay, live music\" and \"it's too loud\".

Food was ok, nothing overwhelming.  Service was difficult to get a hold of, and slow, etc.  It's good, but for all the fuss, it's not worth the prices and there are other better places."}
{"text":"White sangria! So good, but $16 for a mason jar... We tried it outside during Twilight Tuesday (highly recommend for next summer) for only $5, so we decided to sit down and enjoy one at the bar. Extremely delicious but way over priced."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great ambiance / atmosphere!  I had the crab pasta special (it was in a fantastic buttery sauce).  Absolutely delicious.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing special. We ordered the cacciatore plate and some bread which tasted good. The main course was very disappointing. Ordered the chicken shawarma wrap which was nothing but grilled chicken in a pita. The server was excellent and that's why I chose to have 3 starts instead of 2"}
{"text":"Guest chef prepared a four course meal and it was very good. The bar is a hot spot at night."}
{"text":"I visited Drake 150 on a weeknight with coworkers for a post work dinner. Every time I come here, there seems to be a private party happening with a portion of the restaurant booked off. I'd say best bet is to make a reservation, regardless of what day or time you're coming here because it is always always always busy. That being said, I think a busy restaurant is a good indication that the food is good or something is good enough that people are flocking in constantly. 

Because we made a reservation, we were seated quickly at the back of the restaurant. There are a lot of cozy booth tables with dimmed lighting here. The menu isn't crazy in terms of number of options but I'd say they have a good mix of dishes that will appeal to a lot of different people. All the main categories like Pizza, Pasta, Apps etc. are covered and within each there's 3 - 4 options to choose from. The food itself was actually really good as well. The only thing I don't really like about restaurants like this is that the lighting is so dim that you can't properly see and enjoy the visual presentation of food.

The service was a bit slow as well, slower than I would've liked. We struggled to get the waitress' attention a couple of times, while ordering food and especially near the end because we had to leave quickly. 

Not entirely sure if I'd visit Drake 150 again, it wasn't exceptional in any aspect but not bad in any aspect either. There are plenty of other restaurants that will provide similar quality of food for a lower price.

P.S. It was too dark to take pics of the food and I didn't wanna be that person busting out my flash at a dark restaurant."}
{"text":"Really chill and relaxed. The atmosphere here is really laid back considering it's in the financial district, and I liked the overall vibe. Great music, comfy seating, good food, friendly service, good location. It's pricey, but the food is very good and some of it really unique. 

My only complaints are that the menu options were a bit limited when I visited, but the staff were willing to customize orders, and based on the pictures here, it seems that they change up their items every so often. 

I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Naw.  Not my scene, not my thing, didn't get it at all.

If you sit at the bar (as I did), you get the benefit of watching the bartender make the drink with ingredients totally not listed at all on the cocktail menu under the drink you ordered.  (I got the Russian Reviver, which says it has pear nectar in it, but he put in grapefruit beer.  Not the same thing at all.)

The drink was really over priced.  I did like the candied ginger garnish.

Noise level is astronomical, considering the place was not full AT ALL when we got there.  Bar stools were uncomfortable.  I questioned almost every design choice in there, and I never notice things like that.  

It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and we sat at the bar and only ordered one drink each (both off of their cocktail menu).  It was 5 pm sharp when we arrived.

I won't be back, I much prefer the Keg across the street or Nikai at Momofuku."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what all the negative reviews are for? If you eat out in the city you will be used to these prices for trendy restaurants. If you are a fan of the drake hotel and are expecting the same calm, cool and hipster vibe than stay home - the drake one fifty has taken it up a notch and it may be a tad pretentious given the area it is located in but sometimes you need to get out of your comfort zone.

Atmosphere is so fun, the music was insane - we went on a Friday night, 6 of us ... which turned into 8 later. They have a DJ who plays everything from classic Frank Sinatra to throw back Hip Hop, to the latest rocker Lorde. I love some good tunes.

The wine - meh - huge selection - I always cringe when the bottle is $20 at the LCBO and is $60 at the table - but cest la vie - not going to change that.

The girls split the wine and the guys all had scotch. Our server(s) were supper attentive and we never had to look for them to clear or refill water/drinks.

The food - we had the Tartare -it was drool worthy. Another couple swears the Blistered Shisito Peppers are amazing - they ate them up before I could try one lol.

For dinner my man friend had the Roasted Half Chicken (DO IT! Everyone!) and I had the Fried Artichokes, Mushrooms & Polenta with a poached egg (rich, creamy, delicious for a late night warm hug in food form)

We ended dinner with a Unicorn drink - something along the lines of Magical Unicorn? In any case it is super sour, super sweet - and then it grows on you until you need more. 

Over all we never felt rushed or in the way- service was fast, attentive and no mistakes were made. We were there for a total of 6 hours and were being served the entire night.

To put it into context - 2 of us was $170 which included 1 bottle of wine, the tartare, 2 entrees and 3 cocktails. 

I'd go back for sure! If you have a group request the booths! 

** photo booth is a waste - we did it twice and it's so shit lol."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, however the service my group and I were subjected to was humiliating considering the amount of money we spent.

We had a reservation for 6, table was ready and all that jazz. We show up order a bottle of wine, and a few martini's for the group. Over the course of the evening we had 4 bottles of wine, 4 glasses of white, and 3 martini's plus food and desert. Our server Riel was short initially, when it came time to settle our bill he asked us to leave our table, if we wanted to continue drinking bottles of wine we could do so at the bar. Now I have been to places that tell you at the time of reserving that they have two seatings for dinner and you had X amount of time to sit. After my boss paid for our meals and drinks we wanted to order another bottle of wine to finish the night. Riel our waiter wasn't pleased with us ordering another $90 bottle of wine so he proceeded to spill it all over the table when he was pouring it. When we asked for napkins to clean it up with he threw them on the table.

We had reserved the Partners at my work a dinner for 14 people here which after this incident we promptly cancelled. I wouldn't bother with this place again, I'd rather give my money to some other financial district watering hole."}
{"text":"What a fun spot!!! My colleagues organized a dinner at this resto. Never would have even thought of coming to this place but it was located close to the Sheraton Hotel. At first I wondered if this spot was owned by Drake-the degrassi kid but then it clicked - no its the Drake Hotel=classy not chubby. This place was so lively- a DJ booth at the entrance! Music was great -spinning R&B and old hiphop classics. The decor was fun with a central bar, booths and tables around as well as an outdoor patio- there was a lot of space and people. I took notice of the library lamps and pipe/faucet lamps -very original, reminded me of the resto, Tiradito in Mtl! 

Rating on 5*:
I ordered truffle fries for my appetizer***(looked like a rendition of a poutine in a stone skillet, it was great to share); the ceviche was also good to share -came with tortilla chips***; for my entrée- I was excited to try the squid ink seafood pasta*** for 28$ (they went too heavy on the tomatoe sauce, the mussels were chopped too small). 

Drinks -the white wine sangria was really good - approximately 5 1/2 glasses for 36$; OLD FASHION- was simply divine -you can always judge a restaurant's bartender by this drink-sipping into it screamed professional and experience! ; grounds for divorce - was also a very refreshing drink. All cocktails started at 15$

I need to end by complimenting the fine service! Our waitress was very knowledgeable especially in proving names of local hangouts in the area.

 Cheers to a fun night, thank you Drake 150"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a long business lunch.  Decor is the main selling point here.  It's definitely a step away from your standard earls/keg/etc. spots in the financial district.  Has a huge bar with teal seats lined along it - a very vintage yet modern feel to it.  Wood just about everywhere and mimics the Drake Hotel in a way.  The patio should be a hit in the summer.

A relatively new restaurant, but staff were extremely friendly.  May have had something to do with the half full capacity on a Tuesday after Thanksgiving, but our waitress was helpful and sincere.

Food itself is unfortunately nothing to rave about.  It's not great, not bad, and if anything slightly over priced - but what do you expect from something in this area?  Extensive cocktail list, but I stuck to beer (beau's on tap!).  I had the $21 burger - I've had better, but the fries were exceptional.  The $13 drake salad is not much more than a few spinach leaves.  The artisan bread and warm olives were nice.  Bread comes with a nice house-made sweet potato hummus.  Maybe I just made the wrong choices on the menu.  They had a raw bar and some stone oven pizzas which caught my eye, but I wasn't in the mood for seafood.

Overall, not bad.  I'd return for drinks or another lunch to try something different.  Kudos to Drake for opening something different in the otherwise blandish bay st area."}
{"text":"My friend recommended I come to Drake One Fifty for brunch, and I was surprised to see a restaurant located in the midst of all these financial buildings. We came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty empty so there was no need to make reservations. The weather was really sunny and hot so we asked to be seated in the outside patio. 

I was pretty disappointed in their menu because when I go out for brunch, I usually expect a huge selection, but it was a disappointing one page with the standard brunch items. I usually opt for the Eggs Benedict whenever I go out for brunch, so I ordered that and topped it off with avocado for an extra fee. The Eggs Benedict had smoked ham, mustard hollandaise, chicharrones, with a side of hot sauce. This is my first time trying eggs benedict with hot sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised at this wonderful combination. The hot sauce reallys cut the creaminess and richness of the hollandaise sauce which was nice. On the side there was a nice spring salad that came with it. 

Overall, it's a standard brunch place and I felt that it was over priced. There are much better brunch places outside of the Downtown Core with larger portions and a lower price such as Insomnia."}
{"text":"Great ambience. But terrible service. 

I called in to reserve a table in the bar area for afterwork drinks. The hostess stated that the bar area was first come first serve only. Low and behold, I arrive and about a third of the bar tables are reserved. I asked the hostess why the tables were reserved when the person on the phone stated that there was no reservations - apparently they tables are for \"VIPs\". 

I think they should change the name of the place to \"Douchebag One Fifty\""}
{"text":"Great food ! Everything about this place is wonderful. I had a salmon Benedict with hash browns and it was very mouthwatering. I will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while visiting Toronto for a conference. Had the flat iron steak which was delicious! Prices were a bit high here, but you definitely get what you pay for. I recommend."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. I liked it here but those in our group that ate raw oysters got food poisoning . Wrote management about this. They apologized and said they would look into it. That was over 2 weeks ago and I have not heard back from them."}
{"text":"Simply the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had; and the wait staff doesn't even push it as a signature dish. For comparison, it is much better than the famous Brennan's benny in New Orleans."}
{"text":"It was so good I came here twice this week! Once for dinner and once for lunch. Service was friendly but not too attentive. Beautiful decor. Lunch was quick and easy, had enough time to go back to work. I ordered the vegetarian cavatelli, so good. I'm not even vegetarian. I will be back again real soon!"}
{"text":"If ya want to get into places on a busy night, go early. Showed up without a reservation a little after six. We were told up front the table was reserved at 8:00 pm. It was ours until then. Perfect. Another bonus about dining early, fewer people, less noise and faster service. Be warned the portions here are HUGE. I started with the crab croquettes. They were delicious, like a cross between a crab cake and a hush puppy. At first I though 26 bucks was a lot for fried chicken. After I order it I understood why. Holy bucket of chicken Batman. I swear there were 6 pieces of chicken, dipped in hot sauce. After the crab app I could barely get through a whole piece. I ate some in the drive back home. After it was safely across in border in Michigan, I had the rest for dinner."}
{"text":"Nice decor - but thats about where the good ends.  

1st waiter came and took our drink order, 5 min later a second waiter arrives to take our drink order  again - 1st waiter returns with drinks (and got the order wrong) 

Orders for other tables were brought to us repeatedly and when our food finally did arrive my steak was overcooked.  Would have said something to the server, had he returned at ANY point during the meal."}
{"text":"We went to Drake 150 for our new year's eve dinner. We were presented with a yunmy glass of bubbly to start. We had oyster with Riesling jelly, salmon tataki (pistachio gremolata, blood orange confit + blood orange and beet reduction, sumac spiced wild rice), gnocchi (truffle butter, duck prosciutto, brandy poached pears, Treviso), duck breast (seared duck magret, curry cauliflower puree, roasted sunchokes with honey + orange + hazelnuts) and house-made pastry and mignardises, pate De fruit & truffles. The menu sounded drool worthy and at $75, and we had above average expectations. We enjoyed the ambience, laid back service and the creative menu. Some of the dishes came a little on the cooler side and the dessert wasn't what we were expecting. I definitely enjoyed my dinner at Drake Hotel more with the soft shelled crab- not sure if they still have it. It was Soo good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here on a weekday just as the restaurant was opening. Loved the sophisticated, Art Deco atmosphere. Food was decent; the waitress had many great suggestions. We shared the eggplant Parmesan sandwich with 1/2 fries and salad and the mushroom conchiglie. I loved the addition of pesto in the sandwich. The pasta was okay, it was satisfying without being heavy. 

The servers were very attentive and friendly. I must have drank 5 cups of coffee bc they kept offering and I couldn't say no. 

I found the food to be pricey for what it was but the atmosphere and service made the trip worth it. 

Would come again!"}
{"text":"Trendy decor.  Drinks were excellent.  Burger was awesome.  Fries were great, goes well with house-made hot sauce.  Bit pricey but worth it if you're in it for the experience."}
{"text":"I admit, this was our second choice.  If you are trying to decide between Earl's and here, make no mistake.  This is the place you want to be.  The food was tremendous, the service was top notch, and the brown butter old fashioned is easily the best cocktail I have had (during a long and distinguished drinking career).  So good.  Next time I come back, this will be my go to place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple of friends and was seated immediately. 

I love the atmosphere of this place. Lovely decor... very trendy, hip and also gives off a wanderlust vibe. They even have a photobooth ($5 for pics)!

I ordered the shakshuka which was tasty. It was topped with fresh mozzarella, enough spice for me to handle and the grains in this dish gave it more texture and made it filling. It came with sourdough bread to dip on the side but I wish they it had a little bit more bread. 

Food was on the more expensive side but the restaurant has great vibes. Our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We tried to eat there last Saturday.The door was open, no sign of anything special, we were sent packing by them telling us it was a special event (Opera). We had to go across the stree to the Keg where we had a great meal."}
{"text":"The Drake One Fifty is different than the other restaurants in the financial district. From the beautiful decor to their interesting menu, this place has me coming back time and time again. 

On this visit I ordered the fried chicken. It was perfectly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The batter was well seasoned and had a hint of lemon which I really enjoyed. The broccoli was roasted and crunchy, with a little bit of spice coming from the red chilies that were thinly sliced and placed on top. Overall, I was very happy with my lunch choice!"}
{"text":"The Drake One Fifty in the Financial District is a wonderful spot for weekend brunch. I was invited to sample scrumptious dishes that did not disappoint! 

While I nibbled on warm freshly-baked scones, head bartender, Gord Hannah, started off brunch by leading a cocktail master class. Did you know that the Caesar was invented in Calgary in 1969 by restaurateur, Walter Chell? We get to pour and mix this classic Canadian drink consisting of Absolut vodka, Clamato Juice, Carroll & Co. spice mix, horseradish and celery, while not forgetting to first salt the rim of the glass. If you like your Caesar spicy, the Cilantro Tequila Caesar is a must!

You can also enjoy the original Sacre Coeur (Mezcal, dry vermouth, Capo Capo, lime juice, egg white, orange flower water, Perrier lime natural spring water) at the convivial marble bar near the large windows, which overlook York Street.

Chef de cuisine, Jon Pong serves a choice of brunch favourites including: house-smoked salmon Benny with dill hollandaise, salmon roe and toasted sesame; the Drake grilled shiitake omelette with furikake, Bulgarian feta and baguette crostini and the Drake breakfast. I opt for the latter, which includes skillet corn bread, breakfast sausage bacon, two poached eggs, chicharrónes and BBQ bean purée. It was certainly hearty and delicious, especially the fluffy cornbread and well-seasoned sausage bacon. I enjoyed these classic breakfast standards with a twist and had to save room for sweet, fluffy pancakes topped with miso banana caramel and chocolate cream. 

\"The Drake is known for its innovative cuisine and the flagship hotel has amassed a cult brunch following,\" says executive chef Ted Corrado. \"We want to bring that West Queen West flavour to the Downtown Core with some familiar dishes and new culinary creations that work for a light bite or hearty meal and always highlight the best Ontario has to offer.\"

What I like about brunch in the Financial District is that it's not heavily busy or too loud. While that could change, for now, it is certainly refreshing to arrive at the Drake One Fifty without the usual weekday traffic.  

The interior is large with booths and emerald-green banquettes in a classic space with a contemporary look and feel. Geometric patterns on the floor are visually pleasing to the eye. L.A.-based artist Gary Baseman's exhibit, My Eyes are Bigger than my Stomach, feature quirky-looking, cartoon-like characters that pop off the walls. 

I also appreciate that the Drake One Fifty is committed to working with local providers. The restaurant sources bacon and pork from Perth Pork, beef from Cumbrae's, walnuts from 100km Foods Inc., cheese from The Cheese Boutique, Ocean Wise sustainable seafood, seasonal Ontario produce and foraged mushrooms. The Drake One Fifty prides itself of making all breads, pastries, granolas and preserves in-house in the Drake's commissary kitchen. 

Brunch is served at the Drake One Fifty on Saturdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and is located at 150 York Street. For more information, visit: drakeonefifty.ca.

{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch a few times and have enjoyed the burger, the pork chop and the fried chicken at various times. All were solid and found the servers to be friendly if a bit hip at times.
Also stopped in for dinner one evening looking for steak frites and it turned out to be a guest chef night. Looked at the menu choices and to stay. First time I have seen horse tartar on a menu outside of in France but did not have the courage (or enough to drink) to order it. 
Never been disappointed by this place and expect that I will return."}
{"text":"Drake One Fifty is a chic and trendy restaurant located in the heart of the financial district. The decor of the restaurant is an eclectic mix of vintage items and interesting art installations. Drake One Fifty is one of my go to places for business lunches.  The pricing is on the higher end. The atmosphere and menu in my view is better than some of the other choices around like Earls. 

I have been here for dinner, lunch and brunch. The dishes are generally pretty good and well prepared. However, the dishes at times may lack that \"it\" factor that would elevate the dishes from \"pretty good\" to \"excellent\".  The service is generally attentive. Drake is a great choice for business meetings."}
{"text":"I've been here once for light apps and drinks. If you're coming after work, definitely make a reservation. It's constantly busy. 

Unfortunately I haven't tried the entrees but the calamari is okay. The wine list (by the glass) is decent -- much more options by the bottle. 

Also, there's a DJ that can create a bit of noise, making it difficult to hear whomever you're with, if you're close to the bar. 

Great after spot on Wednesday and Thursday. But let me reiterate: unless you're getting there early and beating the crowd; reservation, reservation, reservation!"}
{"text":"The work group had our monthly lunch and D-150 was suggested. 

As we were a large group, our tables were set already and were seated immediately. The lunch menu has limited number of items and was debating about Funnghi Pizza or Zucchini + Corn. Was not sure how a pizza would be as I have had from Pizza Libertto. But decided to go for something different rather than the usual. 

Many in the group either had a burger or the pepperoni pizza (comes uncut and you are provided with a scissor to cut your own slices and also topped with sesame seeds). 

The food came in quickly and one first glance it is more of a salad and did not seem like a dish. The plating looked boring and in a way glad that this dish turned out to be a vegan dish. Now the individual pieces

The hummus delicious and unique. The fried corn (tempura) was amazing. The corn crunchy and very well seasoned. On first bite, wanted more of it! The potatoes some charred and patty pans (squash) were good. The patty pans were better. King Oyster Mushrooms were plain and just a couple. The zucchini I thought would be the star but were bland. The spice sprinkled on the dish tasted like a mixture of black salt, mango powder, and cumin. Almost like Chaat Masala. Overall very good dish, but the quantity was very disappointing. Left a bit hungry. 

Because we were a large group, the mandatory 18% gratuity was added and the staff were courteous to let us all know of the same. Some restaurants have some individuals where they don't make you aware and perhaps hope that the customer may add more. 

Would go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I'm a bourbon fan and this place had the perfect one...\"improved old fashion\", not so sweet.  Highly recommend this place after work for cocktails."}
{"text":"The food is fine. Nothing stands out. Did the prix fixe. But the entertainment makes this place 100% worth heading out to. Popera, a pop up opera. Absolutely delightful. The Opera singers and accompanying piano player seduced us all for a little more than half an hour of some classics and some well executed cabaret bits. I hope this pop up returns many times. 

The service was amazing, except our waiter who replaced our waitress half way through the meal... he forgot us and that's why I took a star away. 

Also this is a very personal pov but I loved the tile work, bar and bathrooms of this place, so beautifully executed but omg the decor bits.... like Epcot had reno'd the world pavillions and the Drake snapped it all up and installed it, albeit artfully, it's a little kitschy."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on Friday the 13th. The decor is cool and the after-work vibe is less Bay St. than I had expected. We ordered the Calamari to start (...just OK) and a couple Tankhouse Ales. The draught beer selection is not that impressive, pretty standard big beer brands with a Mill St. and Beau's mixed in. There's a better selection in bottles but I'm at a restaurant for a reason. Had the burger as my main. The burger itself was weak, lacking umpf or definable taste but the soft shiny bun was good and the fries were also pretty good; crispy shoestring saltiness, yum. The burger meal would have gotten this review 3 stars if it was a reasonable price, but at $22 this was straight-up disappointing. There are too many other options around here for a meal for me to say that I would return. May be back from drinks but probably not."}
{"text":"Great for after work dinner and drinks. This place is loud and energetic. I deducted 2 stars because: 1) the food was very salty and 2) the appetizer arrived after the entrees. I tried the boar bolognese - which was delicious. The roasted cauliflower appetizer - which was really salty. The dessert sampler was perfect for sharing. The burger looked really good and apparently it tasted good too."}
{"text":"Worst service of my life. If you get stuck with Jeremy as your waiter, I recommend you ask to be seated in another section. Not only did Jeremy fail to serve the first 3 arrivals of our party for 25 minutes, but he continued to ignore our table once everyone had arrived. When confronted about his lack of service, he lied to my face, coming up with some fake story about \"French\" style service that does not serve individuals who are mid conversation or looking at their phone. To make matters worst, the Hawaiian pizza that we ordered was painful to eat, and the crab fritters just tasted like bad cornbread. Store manager needs to have a sit down with his staff, and his chef. Special thank you to our second waiter, who managed to make the meal tolerable and was very apologetic for the less than impressive food."}
{"text":"Imagine the rudest person saying the rudest things to you. Depending on your personality, whatever is rattling in your unconscious, and the shady characters you've come across in dark alleys. The combination of words that strikes a chord in your ear will someday prompt you to throw your drink in a strangers face.

i.e.
\"So I had this amazing old fashioned..I don't think I'll ever drink another...\"

\"Yeah, yeah, I don't want to hear about how much better Toronto is than Calgary.\" *raises snooty nose in the air*

Yuck.

Whether a drink was thrown on that day or not it doesn't matter. But what matters is that I tell you about the Brown Butter Maple Old Fashioned at the drake one-fitty!

Gooooooood night nurse. Seriously. After a night of feasting and hoping from joint to joint, my best friend took me here and I had this magical concoction. The subtle parrying between the maple's sweetness and the bitters of the alcohol floated on the skating rink of the nutty notes of brown butter. Yeah I'll wax poetry on this drink like I'll wax that ass.
I've had too much to drink.

I digress. I love the feel of this place and would have been driven to alcoholism drinking here every night. Lovely staff, lovely menus, lovely music."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. Nothing special. The atmosphere is very nice. I think it is a nice place to have a drink when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for a snack. Had the beef tartare, a burger and sea bream stick. I was unimpressed. The burger was good, but the rest was not tasty and the ambiance is a bit pretentious. I was surprised that the beef tartar were huge beef chunks scattered all over the plate, rather than neatly placed in a circle. The taste was highly overpowered with vinegar.  The sea bream tasted burnt. They gave pickled veggies and popcorn as a free appetizer.  The waiters wear very tight clothes. The washroom for women is unmarked and beside a photo booth."}
{"text":"Just came home after enjoying a night out downtown. I wanted to check out Drake 150 for a while, but wasn't sure what to expect after reading reviews on Yelp.

This place is in a great location. Right at the corner of Queen and Adelaide, it's right in the heart of the Financial District of Toronto. I love the decor; it's a mix between a diner (with booths and all) and a lounge (live DJ spinning). Service is excellent - our server knew both the food and beverage menu well. 

The food was pretty good. I ordered the baked oysters (an appetizer) and poutine; my pal ordered the halibut dish. The baked oysters were good; it was buttery good with breadcrumbs and a leaf on top. My pal's halibut was a generous portion of broiled fish. It was light and a great meal for the summer. As for the poutine, it was a 'meh.' You can skip the fries here.

As others have mentioned, this isn't the place to go for a cheap eat. Come here to enjoy the entire package - it's a great place to eat at if you're in the mood to celebrate or just splurge on good food and drinks.

Good for: dinner, groups"}
{"text":"I went to Drake One Fifty for lunch one day when I was in Toronto. It is very conveniently located, as it is attached to the Hilton hotel and conference center downtown and we didn't need to leave the building (it was raining that day). The staff was very pleasant, and were able to grant our request to expedite the meal since we had a limited time for lunch. I had the risotto which was very tasty and well balanced. I really liked the roast squash and green tomatoes that were on the risotto, which gave the dish richness and acidity respectively. The other people at my table had their margarita pizza, lamb gyro, and avocado toast and were all very happy with their dishes also. There was a misunderstanding with the avocado toast order that the staff took care of very quickly. 

Overall, I felt like the convenience of the restaurant's location was a big bonus."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef tartar, octopus, fried cauliflower, lobster pizza and burger. Everything was really good except for the lobster pizza and octopus. The pizza was blend and octopus was dry. However, the burger was super juicy and the tartar was amazing but weird paired with chips. Ambiance is nice but I kept on smelling this weird bleach smell that was turning me off"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Probably the best steak tartar i have ever had...seasoned just right, lots of flavor and the beef was the star. I also highly recommend the wonderfully cooked and delish gnocchi  

I still think this restaurant will lose its luster in a hurry.  Positioned in the financial district, bay st'ers wont love the hipster feel for long.   I also wasn't thrilled with how casual it was for the price i was paying.

They caried my favorite scotch with was a big bonus too.....ill only go back mid week when its a bit more quiet and i can just enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Oh my god. !! Probably the best ribeye I've ever had.  The steak melts in your mouth !  The seasoning is delicious definitely recommend !  We also had the meatballs and queso fundido. Which were also very good !  Great environment and great music. Must try if you are ever in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and food. Service is also great. Biggest PRO is you can get your burger cooked to order. No more Canadian Well Done Hockey Pucks for me!"}
{"text":"Super trendy, upscale vibe - a great place to grab some fancy cocktails with friends or coworkers.  It definitely strikes me more as a drink spot than a food spot as it's on the dark / romantic side and seems to attract an after work crowd, so I'm not sure that I'd eat here, but for post-work or pre-dinner drinks it's great!"}
{"text":"Cool space, nice decor, but honestly the server was rude, the starters we ordered were terrible and we ended up leaving and going to another place."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a quick breakfast and the place was already pretty packed. The atmosphere and the decor is pretty nice. Our servers were very friendly and served us very quickly.

Ordered the melted meatballs which consisted of meatballs on toasted with cheese melted on top with a side of salad. Not sure what the dressing for the salad was because it was quite bland and the meatballs were a little salty. There wasn't much flavour in the whole dish itself and it wasn't that special."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a few drinks and a little bite to eat before hopping to the next place. It was full but we got a table in 10 minutes which we didn't mind. 

We ordered are usual drinks and to eat we had the meatballs and Drake + bake, which was a variety of breads with butter and aioli. Kinda average and overpriced but we only ordered so we wouldn't drink on an empty stomach. 

The atmosphere was nice and around 8pm there was a live DJ. Service overall was slow but forgivable. That's about all I have to say. 3/5 for me."}
{"text":"Visited a couple of days ago for a work party and enjoyed the food, drinks, and service.

The food was pre-organized so apps were sent around to our group. 

Sampled some of a delicious cheese plate, yummy crostini with whipped ricotta and maple drizzle, tasty bocconcini pizza, and an insanely good fried chicken slider. Not sure if these are regular menu items but all of the food I tried was on point. Service was friendly and attentive.

I ordered the Gin Gin mule cocktail and really liked it! I am a sucker for ginger beer - so good!

Would return again to check out their patio and \"Twilight Tuesdays\" (looked like a fun outdoor BBQ/market of sorts)."}
{"text":"Seemed like a cooler place in terms of the ambiance but I wasn't blown away. Everything was just fine. I went on a Friday night with my boyfriend and it was surprisingly quiet. 

The food was average. We got the beef tartar to start, burger and capellini en brodo. The food seemed a bit over powered by salt. Service was average mediocre. Won't be running back there anytime soon which is a shame... I love the Drake Hotel and Drake Devonshire but they don't seem at the same level."}
{"text":"Drake One Fifty is one of the more popular hangout spots after-hours during weekdays for all the financial district employees.  I came here with two friends on a Wednesday night after work at around 6 and it was already packed with people!

As I walked in, I noticed there was a DJ playing some live beats as the area near the entrance is more for people who just want to have a drink after work at a bar.  We were seated near the back where the dining area was.

After going through the menu, we ordered the following dishes:
Baked Oysters (comes in 4) - Appetizers
Tartare - Appetizers
Drake poutine - Appetizers
Margarita Pizza - Main
Fried Chicken - Main (Feature of the day)

The oysters, although baked, I was still able to taste the freshness of the oysters!  Impressive!

The Tartare is somewhat different than the tartare you would see normally in other restaurants.  Instead of the more common salmon and tuna, the tartare here uses raw sirloin, which for me was amazing because i LOVE raw beef!

Drake poutine is once again different than your normal poutine in other restaurants!  The Drake poutine comes with chicken and the gravy they use tasted like it was mixed with teriyaki sauce which i really enjoyed!

Pizza was thin-crusted, normal and it was decent.

Fried chicken comes with watermelon cubes which are unique, two corns and three pieces of chickens!  The chickens are all boneless and fried well, however, make sure you use the sauce provided with the chicken or else the chicken will taste dry!!!

Overall, I had a very good experience, I gave this place a 4 stars because it's kind of loud even though we were already in the dining area and the restaurants is VERY dim!  Makes you want to sleep RIGHT after the meal!

PS - you probably asking if this restaurant is related to the Canadian singer Drake, the answer is no!  The DJ didn't even play Drake's beats!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are bad reviews for this place but it can all be accounted for the experience you had, which depends on your server, company, etc.

I found this place to be really cool, hip, and funky.  It reminded me of a 50's diner type place with tile floors...love it.

We were here for a bday and had a fixed menu which included pizza, gnocchi, roasted chicken (my fav), salad, and other yummies.

I had a great time here an the food was pretty good, not amazing but definitely good.

I'd come back for a 2nd time and see if the consistency is on par to make sure my 4 rating is a 4 rating.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is great for drinks or dinner. Great sharing options; my boyfriend and I got the cauliflower, gratin, & french onion soup. It was the perfect amount, and everything was delicious. The mulled wine is a must try in the winter as well."}
{"text":"They have Wi-Fi and the food was great; however, the bartender dropped off a few drink menus assuming I wanted alcohol. I don't drink so sat there with my water wondering when he would give me a food menu. I was starving! Great atmosphere with a good DJ. Patio seating is also available."}
{"text":"coming here accidentally on a Saturday night when our entourage was supposed to go to DRAKE HOTEL, we decided to spend some time here and have a drink.
This venue is popular during the week for after work food and drinks due to its location in the financial district. Their menu is extensive with a good selection of grub and drinks. 
The ambiance is great, and the layout is in fact quite easy to get around; with the huge wrap around bar in the middle of the floor it makes it a focal point. Aside from the ambiance, the place is clean, and the staff were pleasant. 
Though we had few drinks along the bar counter, we had a great time just to TAKE-in the atmosphere.
A potential go to place since its right by my work....."}

Loved their pizzas especially the Margherita one. The ceviche was very small, pricey and just ok. The sangria was great. Great place to get catch up with a friend or for after work drinks."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

Came here with a group for brunch on a weekend as we were seeing a play later that afternoon and we wanted a bite to eat beforehand.  It's pretty easily accessible via the TTC so it makes for a convenient place to go.

It's pretty packed here on a weekend - which was expected.  We were a group of 6 and the table we got was tiny.  There was hardly any room for all of our meals and trying to eat without bumping into the person next to you was at times difficult.  

I got the shakshuka - typically a dish with poached eggs in a sauce of tomatoes, chilies, onions and a variety of other spices.  I generally don't like runny eggs so I asked the server if my egg could be more cooked and they accommodated me without any hesitation!  The dish came with some toasted garlic bread (a little too tasted for my liking but it sopped up the sauces well enough).  The dish was great - lots of flavours going into it and it was quite filling for me.

 The service was friendly if not a bit slow.  The décor is nice, however my overall all feeling about this place was that this is a place where lovely older ladies lunch - LOL.  Nothing wrong with that vibe at all, but that's the vibe I got :)"}
{"text":"We had a lovely late night snack and drinks on Saturday evening after a day at TIFF. Tired, I left my eye glasses at the table. After reaching out early Sunday morning, and I got a timely and friendly response from Sarah Lyons.  She found my eyeglasses and reached back to me in the early afternoon. We collected them this evening and I am thrilled

Many, many thanks"}
{"text":"Amazing. I don't ever leave yelp reviews but I was so surprised they only have 3.5 stars that I felt I needed to! Jordan was awesome! The flavors were so crazy perfect, super fast service and efficient! Toronto is trumping LA right now. Seriously, loved this place!"}
{"text":"I really the environment and atmosphere, despite the limited food menu!  The drinks menu is extensive and if you enjoy cocktails, they have imaginative ones out there! To be frank, I enjoyed my stay sufficiently enough to decide this is a place I want to frequent more regularly after work."}
{"text":"Extremely salty dishes- all the pastas
Smoke coming out of kitchen. Be prepared 
Not recommended 
Too pricey for the quality - disappointed"}
{"text":"Here in Toronto for the Grey Cup and stopped here for a quick bite before the game, and it was great!! Service and food were perfect!"}
{"text":"An extra star for having an American style IPA, Bone Shaker, on the menu. Wish it was on tap. however. Your basic Bay street after work bar. Good enough place to grab a beer after work before hitting the road."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars - I'd say Drake One Fifty leans towards Canadian comfort foods. 
The interior of the restaurant is retro-looking with a large bar area. Expect the bar area to get more packed as the night progresses.

ALBACORE TUNA TATAKI 
Loved the ancho chile oil and the charred green onion as the tuna tataki pairing. Finished this up so quickly - yummy!

RABBIT CRESTE DE GALLO
The sauce was creamy and filling. Delicious.

ST. CANUT SUCKLING PIG
The roasted pork shoulder was very tender - I thought it would be harder in texture but it was surprisingly very juicy and soft. The honey glazed onions were also nicely done."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and great food. Our server Jenna was incredible. Super knowledgeable and knows all for the great places for food and cocktails. Drake 151 is the best place so far that I have been for handcrafted cocktails. It does not disappoint."}
{"text":"It took over 40 minutes to get our table drinks and get food menus. Had to get up fron our table and confront the waiters multiple times to get any attention. They charged us 12$ for french fries we DID NOT ORDER. when they brought them to our table, we told them we did not order them, they accused us of lying, and then said they were on the house... AND THEN CHARGED US FOR THEM ANYWAYS! on top of everything, charging for condiments is pathetic. this restaurant is horrible."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for dinner.  The ambience is great, nice art on the wall and a great dj to keep the mood right.  I had the goat ravioli, first off the flavours of this dish are bang on, absolutely delicious, however it only came with 5 loonie sized pieces! When I ordered I thought I would get enough to atleast fill me up like a normal size dinner portion.  Nope, I was wrong.  I picked at my husbands fries to help fill me up.  Cocktails are far to expensive, $16 for a martini, yikes!"}
{"text":"For me, the place rocks in terms of atmosphere on a lazy Sunday brunch afternoon.

Live music playing .... quite lively soulful music. Makes for a nice party atmosphere. The first thing I thought of was, must get a bunch of people here. 

I ordered the drake breakfast. It was okay. Offered standard fare but the standout was the cornbread. Damn! I could have eaten way more of that. If you order brunch ask for a side order of the cornbread - yo wont regret it.

I was kicking myself for not ordering some other items that looked much more enticing like the shashuka or huevos rancheros.  Oh, next time.

Staff were friendly and food came out in a timely manner despite our large party.

Totally recommend for a lively afternoon of eating, drinking and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday last Friday April 25, 2014.
The place was filled with people. When you first walk in, you go through the bar to get to the dining area. The dining area was interesting - it was a mix of trendy and diner feel. They even have a photo booth where you can take a 4 pics for $5 (you get two pictures).

The music was extremely loud. It was hard to hear my friends who were just sitting beside me so this is not a place to go if you want to have a serious conversation. However, I have to say that I really enjoyed the music. They had a DJ spinning old school hip hop, which brought it back for me and my friends.

We had:

The beef Tartare $16: Hand-chopped cumbrae's sirloin, tomato puree, pickled shiitake, soft cooked egg york and crostini. The appearance of this dish looked really cool. The raw egg on top was a nice touch. The portion wasn't very much for $16, but this is to be expected. The taste of the tartare was okay. I didn't taste the tomato puree or pickled shiitake. I actually found the tartare rather bland. I did like the crostini, but even putting the tartare on it, it didn't have much flavour (B-)

Frites $8: I found this rather soggy. (C)

I had the linguine & clams for my main: $26: Clams, house-made bacon, crispy lemon & herb panko + wine better sauce. The pasta was al dente. The portion was not bad. The overall taste of the pasta was good. Adding bacon and clams added a nice touch. I did find the dish a bit too salty and spicy (B+)

My friends had:
Slow Braised Short Ribs $26: Horseradish potatoes, beet root, witled dandelion and banyula gastrique. The plating of this dish was terrible! They gave her this big plate with two small pieces of short ribs on one side. It looked like half of the food was missing! I was pretty disappointed in the portion, especially for $26. The short rib itself tasted tender and flavourful. However, this was NOT a hardy dish (C)

Potato Pizza $19: I didn't try this, but my friend said it was good.

Margherita Pizza $17: I didn't try this, but my friend said it was good. The pizza came with these scissors for you to cut the pizza with. I found that pretty unique (B+)

Dessert:

Daily Pie: Apple pie $9 - this was a normal pie. Nothing special. B

Mint & Chocolate cake: $9. This looked really cool and tasted awesome too! A-

Overall, the food wasn't all that great here and for the price, you are better off going somewhere else. However, I do have to give the service an A+. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We actually ended up getting free drinks from a waiter because we made a bet to see who was the closer to the age of this waiter. Whomever lost had to buy shots. Instead of getting my friend (who lost) to buy it, the waiter went and got us free tequila shots. I thought that was pretty cool! We also did the photo booth thing and found that to be a great way to end the evening at Drake. So for the experience, it was great...but I wouldn't go there for the food. I would go back for evening drinks though cause the music was good!"}
{"text":"It's a little bit pretentious, or something - I don't even know exactly what I'd call it - but Drake One Fifty (See, it's 150! Stop that.) did put on a nice lunch - the menu has a lot of interesting options, both conventional and a little unique, and in all the party of seven we I went with got good, friendly service and the food was reasonably good.

I wavered on four or five stars, but I can't really think of anything that would make me really honestly say it didn't earn all five.

Too pricey for an every day lunch option, but nice for something different once in a while."}
{"text":"Mmm had dinner here last night and it was a great experience. 

Pros:
-coat check is free and offered when you enter
-decor is unique and fun but still upscale 
-they have a photo booth!!!!!
-loved the bathrooms, I love stalls that are mini rooms and the styling was also up my alley
-the food - everything I ate was amazing. Had a snow crab pizza (so much crab!) the oysters (best I've ever had), the \"drake bake\" which was a selection of breads with dips and ricotta spread
-cocktails were delicious 
-waitress was super friendly and helpful, attentive but not constantly in our face either 

Cons:
-nothing on the dessert menu appealed to me :(

Really if that's the only negative that barely counts. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of people to celebrate my birthday! They were very accommodating when I called to book reservations for a Saturday night! During the evening I heard compliments all around from my 20 guests and I agree everything about the restaurant was fantastic! Our server recommended some new martinis I had never tried before and they fit exactly what I was craving (sweet plus vodka = French martini!) Food was delicious and as a special thank you my party got a bunch of tickets to their photo booth which was an awesome added touch!"}
{"text":"Pretentious? Check. All about ambience with no substance? Check. Fancy sounding items on the menu that makes you go \"oh my\" until after you eat it you go \"oh my this is average\"? Check.
Anyways, you get the point."}
{"text":"We were a party of three for lunch on a weekday and the place filled quickly but the services was great. I had the gnocchi (picture attached) and the rest of my table had the half chicken and the 150 burger both said it was delish! We shared the lemon tart which was also tasty and a very refreshing way to end the meal.

The atmosphere is lighter and more fun than a lot of the other places in the financial district which I enjoyed. 

I will go back."}
{"text":"Can't speak to their food, but they make a mean cocktail! I had the Rust and Bone (bourbon, amaro, benedictine) and it was perfectly prepared. Smokey, strong and not watered down - just the way I like it. They have an extensive cocktails menu (less so for beers), so I'm sure they can find something for what you are looking for at the moment. Definitely more on the expensive side since cocktails were $14-16, but that is to be expected for the location, atmosphere and crowd.

The service was great, granted it was a Sunday afternoon and there wasn't much of a crowd. He made sure we got our drinks, checked on us periodically but left us mostly on our own. The atmosphere is very stylized, with a narrow covered patio space just off the road that gives an option of outdoor space. Think trendy diner that is just quirky enough to stand out but swanky enough to host a relaxed business meeting. A great place to grab a drink and kill a couple hours."}
{"text":"I visited Drake One Fifty for the very first time yesterday. We order margarita pizza, chocolate cake (can't remember the name), wine and beers. I must say that I like the ambience and atmosphere. Unfortunately it has a slow services yet super friendly staff and just okay but pricey food. Honestly, I'd like to come back for its ambience but they need to improve the quality of the food and services. I def recommend this place to have a glass of wine or beer.."}
{"text":"Nonna's Meatballs $15 - alright


House made pasta: Roasted Lamb Malfatti $23 - broth no sauce?  


Smoked Salmon Nicoise $27 - stingy on the salmon  


Tiramisu $11 - dense, some citrius flavour, made a bit old?


I met up with some ex-colleagues at Drake One Fifty for lunch. We were planning to sit outside in their patio, however, it was a bit chilly so we were moved inside. We sat at their tables for guests with no reservations. The decor is interesting and I'll leave it at that because I'm about the food (though the patio tables seemed cramped together).


We started with Nonna's meatballs ($15). There were three meatballs covered in tomato sauce and topped with some melted cheese and basil. The meatballs were two-biter size and very tender. Flavour wise they were not bad. The tomato sauce was simple (good) and had a nice texture as a result of the tomatoes passing through the hand mill. 


For my main, I had the roasted lamb malfatti ($23). Instead of pasta being coated in a sauce, this pasta sits on a broth, is topped with some slices of roasted lamb, (raw) Swiss chard and parmesan. The slices of roasted lamb did not have much flavour. The Swiss chard tasted like the earth/mud it grew from (saved by hints of parmesan cheese); I don't think it was cooked - maybe sautéing the chard would have eliminated this \"earthy\" taste. The broth is some type of meat broth, not overly salty, but could be salty if you finished all of it. I found the dish to be confusing because it is hard for the pasta to be coated in the broth and take on the flavour. You would have to eat the dish with a spoon to get the broth. A positive point for me was the portion size :).   


The smoked salmon nicoise was shared. The salmon had a nice smoked flavour as advertised, and the gribiche sauce was quite tasty. However, I think they could have given more salmon for $27.



To end off the meal, the Tiramisu ($11). It looked like a tiramisu but it didn't taste like a traditional tiramisu. I got hints of citrus, however, when I look at the menu, there is no mention of citrus being used in the tiramisu. Maybe it was from the rum? Regardless, I didn't like this taste. The tiramisu was also more dense than other tiramisu's that I have had and therefore not as enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great place for any type of dinner outing! I went with a group of colleagues after a long meeting and had an excellent time.
Our server was great - excellent wine and beer suggestions. 
I ordered the burger with \"fancy\" fries - made with truffle oil and Parmesan (so good!) 
The house-made ricotta they served with the \"Drake n Bake\" was so good- could not get enough.

Only slightly negative thing to mention is the price can add up if you order suggested apps for the table. Other than that - really great dining experience."}
{"text":"The place is nice, but fairly overrated. I happened to be invited to a birthday dinner on Saturday, March 26. The dinner reservation was for 6 people at 6:30pm and there were no issues with that. The place was quiet but it was still early. 

The waiter was kind, but forgot 2 drink orders (separate instances). Everyone else's food arrived 10-15 minutes from when we places our orders except mine... For perhaps a good 20 minutes, my friends and I sat there waiting for my order OR the waiter to drop by. Maybe the burger (which is what I ordered) takes longer to cook. Maybe they actually forgot. 

Skip forward 20ish minutes, the waiter finally comes back and notices I'm plate less. Ding ding ding, acknowledges he messed up and didn't even input my order (what?). Ok, I understand everyone has off days but... Another 20 minutes go by, I finally get my burger, after all my friends have finished eating. They all sit awkwardly waiting for me to finish my dinner. 

I was only offered an apology, which was just a quick, \"Sorry about that.\"

My experience left a little sour taste in my mouth. For a place that you pay premium for drinks + food, you'd expect better service, especially with it being practically empty. 

Overall, the food was nice but the experience left little to be desired. Would not go back, or recommend it to others. The Keg is across the street if you want other options. 

2.5/5, 2.5 purely for the burger and 2.5 off for the service."}
{"text":"Great space and design. caters to the after work crowd and clears out by 9 though. Heard weekends aren't that busy which is a shame bc the bar is really nice.

Food was great though! Staff greeted us with complimentary glass of champagne (not sure if this is standard but we were by no means anyone special). 

Fresh baked bread basket!

One of the better lamb shanks I've had. The oysters were a little funky but could have just been my batch."}
{"text":"Such an eclectically decorated place, great bar area, and diverse menu.  This was our last meal in Toronto and it was a great farewell.  I want to urge all patrons to order the beef carpaccio with truffle shavings, it's beyond words.  So many great options there's something for every taste bud.  Shout out to the manager Leila who actually mailed us our photobooth pics due to a temporary malfunction with the photobooth... Um yes there's a photobooth!!!! So fun."}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere. Service was appalling. Food was not that good and expensive. The two of us came in at 8 Sat night. The place was busy but not full. Service was slow to get our first drink and then continued slow. We ordered soup and 3 appetizers. It took a full 40 minutes for the soup and another 35 minutes for 2 appetizers to come and an additional 10 for the last one.  The soup had wonderful flavours but inexplicably had an overcooked pieces of pasta on top + in a Thai soup?? Brussel sprouts very good. Sweet potato was deep fried and had a gloopy curry sauce. Frites were soggy. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work on a Friday for early dinner before a ballet. I had seen this place mentioned online more for its decor than its food. Since we got in at around 5pm there was lot of empty seats and room on the patio. The place itself is super decked out. You can tell a lot of $$ went into the way the place looks. It's like a swanky diner. The prices are pretty swanky also (which I expected since it's in the Financial District). You'll be spending at least $18 for an entree. 

My partner and I got the daily specials: a soft shell-crab sandwich with fries ($21) and a Tuna pizza ($20). 

Service was decent and fast, except our server was a bit pushy about us ordering drinks.

The soft shell crab sandwich was decent. Nothing to write home about. The crab itself was light and crispy but lacked depth favour-wise. The taste was very predictable. 

We both enjoyed the pizza a lot more than the sandwich. All the flavours came together well and the sweetness of the onion was a good touch. The dish also featured some tapenade and cheese within the toppings and those were also great additions. If you don't like arugula then you prob won't like this pizza. There were tons on it. 

Despite liking the pizza and the fancy decor, I would prob not revisit this restaurant. Neither of the dishes we ordered was a stand-out and there are tons of other options nearby where'd I'd get a more interesting meal for way less money. 

It's worth checking out for the vibe it creates, but if you're all about the food then go somewhere a bit more adventurous."}
{"text":"The pizza here is SO good and they serve it with scissors to cut it (an Italian thing) which is fun and sets them apart. Probably one of my favourite places to get pizza.  I really like coming to this place and it's usually a go-to for me and my boyfriend. It's an easy pick I guess you could say. Upfront: it is over-priced. Everything is expensive so prepare yourself. My parents live in Prince Edward County and I visit the Drake often there, too.

I love their brunch,except their bacon is terrifying. It's bacon on steroids. Like that stuff must come off the bodybuilding pigs or something. They do have fun cocktails, and I've always been a fan of the interiors of the Drake locations. This one is sort of whimsical, and they still have their signature photo booth. Make sure you grab a box of matches on your way out - I always pick one up. It's a cute takeaway."}
{"text":"Decent food with enough difference to others in area to make it interesting.  Flavours all good - meatballs really tasty.

Service was very good.

Seating was uncomfortable for longer periods as the tables are not meant for tall people.  Prices rather steep for what you get."}
{"text":"Came here for an evening work event and was able to try a number of dishes and drinks. We had a couple rounds of drinks. Overall the cocktail selection is great, but it's quite pricey. Looking at 15-20$ per cocktail. For food we had a couple dishes:

Fries - these were awesome, I really enjoyed them. Great with our drinks.
Meatballs - small portion, and nothing outstanding.
Hawaiian pizza - tasty and great toppings
Potato pizza - this was kind of weird for me. Some at my table enjoyed it, but I didn't like the potato on bread concept. It just seemed to bland and heavy

Overall, I found Drake One Fifty a bit expensive for my liking. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a hip and cool place for drinks near the financial district. 

Looking at other reviews, I may be back to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Omgggg LOVED the Drake benny. The hollandaise sauce was on point and the english muffin was so soft.The ambience was casual with good music and decent service at the lounge."}
{"text":"I dined here with a colleague from work on a weeknight and was surprised to see how busy it was at 6:30pm and onward! There was a live DJ playing upbeat background music (although nothing recognizable) that was great for the atmosphere, although it was difficult to have a conversation.

The staff were pleasant and attentive, but didn't really go out of their way - There were no recommendations on beverages or food choices or explanation of the menu in any way. There was also significant lag time in actually bringing the food out. 

For appetizers, we shared the crispy cauliflower, which although was fried, was not at all heavy and had a nice spicy flavour. We also shared the beet salad with pear, endive, hazelnut butter, za'atar and green harissa, which was lack lustre; the best thing on the plate was the hazelnut butter.

For our entrees, we had the bass with gnocchi (2 pieces only), curried spaghetti squash (that was doused in a sticky asian-inspired sauce) and hazelnuts (1 visible nut on the plate). It was a mish-mash of flavours on a plate, but didn't seem like a cohesive dish. My colleague had the zucchini and squash dish (which was fried), and seemed to enjoy it. 

Overall, this may be a nice place for after-work drinks and the ambiance, but for the price, there are better options, especially in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple: Don't bother coming here for the food. Our group had the torcheti, Hawaiian pizza and the bream and they were all bad. Not ok, but bad, would never order again. The pizza was one of the worst we had ever tasted in a sit down resto.  We should have complained but didn't. I seem to be in the minority judging by the other reviews but I cannot recommend drake 150."}
{"text":"I dined at Drake One FIfty a few months after if opened and wasn't impressed. Although the food was alright, the service was poor and I had decided not to return for dinner, although I had at times enjoyed a few drinks at the bar.

With friends in town on a short visit, I presented them with a list of dining options for a Saturday night, and so we settled on Drake 150. Sounds so pretentious, but these friends are experienced travelers, dining often at Michelin star awarded restaurants and have standards and expectations. Natives of Toronto, they are familiar with \"The Drake\" and its ambiance and so I was hoping they would enjoy the experience, and that the service had improved since my inital visit. 

There were four of us who dined at the Drake One Fifty. The service and food complemented the great evening we were having, enjoying each other's company and catching up. 

We all had not seen each other for some time and the staff was very patient as we kept getting side-tracked, forgetting about the menu.  Finally, we decided. Two of us ordered coctails (The Picadilly, and one called the Dynamic Unicorn), while the others got a head start on a bottle of wine (Malivoire Merlot, I believe).  Aperol and Campari gave the Picadilly a touch of sweetness without being too strong and it sounds bizarre.... but it tarted SOOOO good with the dill and cucumber.

We started with a few appetizers: Nonna's meatballs (which didn't tasted EXACLY like my Nonna's) were light-tasting and in a simple tomato sauce. Scallops and pork belly.... um yeah! and also the bread basket whcih came with a flavoured butter, an eggplant bruschetta and the coffee-infused oil. All very good and the eggplant spread was so good we asked for more. :)

Cue bottle of wine #2.

We were quite unimaginative with our entree selection: 3 x black cod with a side of brussel sprouts and 1 x moules & frites. The black cod was services with this lightly charred gabbage - could have eaten a bowl of it on it's own!. The first was cooked perfectly.  I'm told the mussels were delicious and there were plenty of them!

Rather than dessert, we decided to keep it classy and go for more booze! Me, another Picadilly (why mess with a good thing!?) and my friend had a warm drink. One friend was deciding on another \"glass\" of wine but wasn't into the house cabernet/merlot blend.  As he toyed with the selection available by the glass, one of the servers stopped by with two tasting glasses of wines she suggested for him, LIKE SERVICE, WOAH!  ...And this when he was ONLY planning on ordering another \"glass.\"  

Anyway, the suggestions were on-point and rather than one glass--we went for another bottle of wine.

Cue bottle of wine #3 : Hope Family Vineyards, \"The Troublemaker\" Rhone blend.
(This wine was outstanding).

Anyway, our server (blonde with dark-rimmed glases) and the support staff were wonderful: knowdegable, pleasant and patient. :) They anticipated our needs and the servie was spot-on making it a memorable experience, which may have been a little unexpected. Surpirses like these are so nice!   

The food was very good and on-par with other restaurants in the city of the same calibre. However it was made that much more delicious becuase it was paired with great drinks and such precise service.

Looking forward to returning to the Drake One Fifty and a little disappointed I stayed away for so long."}
{"text":"Food was okay, be prepared for a wait.  Ambiance and service was great, perfect for photo shoots.  We ordered off of the fixed lunch menu, but we were surprised by the amount of time. The Lémon cake desert with the raspberry sorbet was to die for! Would come back again for the dessert"}
{"text":"Big BIG disappointment! Do not go here! 
My husband and I had reserved a table for what was supposed to be a proper Thanksgiving dinner. On the day just as we were on our way to the restaurant, my husband got a call from them. Apparently they had run out of turkey and called to let us know. Firstly, what? How can you run out of turkey on THANKSGIVING?? If you know it's a special holiday and you have a certain amount of bookings, you make sure you have enough. Secondly, why didn't they call earlier but instead we got to know on our way to the restaurant. My final point, our reservation was quite early in the evening and they ALREADY(!) ran out of food!?! That itself is a clear indication to me that Drake One Fifty is lacking planning skills. 
So instead of celebrating Thanksgiving with a traditional turkey dinner we ended up spending the next hour looking for an alternative restaurant. Needles to say we did not get our turkey dinner. Even though we found a good restaurant to spend our money in, it was a huge disappointment that Drake One Fifty caused us.
Do yourself a favor and go spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch on a Friday, LOVED it. Server was very polite and helpful with recommendations . We started with a Pimm's cup cocktail. It was tangy and refreshing, not too boozy, perfect for lunch.
We started with oysters, beef tartare and the brussels sprouts. Beef tartare and brussels sprouts were SO GOOD! Beef was premium grade and didn't need much to dress it up. I couldn't stop eating the brussels sprouts, and I don't even like the vegetable! Great smokiness and flavour, very tender but crisp on the outside, not bitter at all.
I got the burger, very nice burger but definitely not among the best ones I've ever had. Fries though, damn. I was stuffed and still could not stop.
We got the flourless chocolate torte to end, it was decent. I didn't understand how the components worked together, seems like a lot of tasty garnishes randomly thrown together.
Overall, I would love to come again, but as a peasant, I think it'll be more like a Licious event or a special occasion."}
{"text":"I had the One Fifty Burger. It was good but nothing to really brag about. The ambiance seemed cool and I enjoyed the music. It has a very limited menu and I don't think there's anything that draws me back for dinner. Note: By the way, this is not Drake Hotel's restaurant, not Drake the rapper's restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for my girlfriend's birthday, the vibe and atmosphere is great. Food was ok. Don't think I will be coming back here any time soon though."}
{"text":"We went here for drinks and it took them 20 minutes to get us our two drinks. They weren't that busy so we didn't know why it was taking so long. The fries were good, but they did charge you extra for asking for aioli."}
{"text":"They must have a small kitchen because the menu is lacking and choice is limited. They have a burger, a couple of pizzas (none of which I would ever order) and two salad choices and that is it basically.
The salad choices are Kale (kale, cheese and hazelnuts) and cesar (although they call it something else that is basically what it is) with something called gem lettuce. I tried the salad which was bare bones. Paying $20 for a salad with a few leaves, a little bit of grated cheese and half a nut is not for me.
The emphasis is mostly on selling you wine or other alcohol.
It is packed with the Bay Street crowd after work just like Earls. It is loud and busy. I assume people go here for people watching and being show offy. My group which seems to judge everything by how attractive and flaunting the waitresses are was not impressed. They won't come back because of this and agreed \"back to Earls\" and I won't be back because there is not much on the menu I would like to order.
I like to add that our waitress was friendly and was always there to refill my water and (suggest different wines to the team).
The design of the restaurant and bar is different. It is a cross between a high-end 1930s washroom and a speakeasy from the mafia films."}
{"text":"They're a very busy restaurant during weekday lunches, and they pack in a lot of tables in very tightly. It can get uncomfortable, being within an easy elbow of the person beside you, but I guess it's just the way things are at a lot of these restaurants where space is at a premium. If you don't have a reservation, you may be at the mercy of whether they can find you a spot at all.

I had the lamb shawarma. The lamb shawarma was excellent, as it had a very good mixture of sauce and very juicy lamb.

The server also kept our water topped up pretty well throughout the lunch and was very polite and patient with us, even though we sat for a while."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I hosted an event here so I will give the run down of the positives and negatives based on that. The restaurant was very cute, however we were surprised at how small our space was based on the layout pdf we were given. It was enough space but it was a bit of a shock first when we arrived. That aside, the pass around food was amazing! I think all of our guests enjoyed it. It managed to go around all night which was great. Some of the items we had were fancy fries, fancy chicken nuggets, shrimp on toast and cauliflower croquets. We also ordered a charcuterie station which was so so. We didn't get bread to begin with which seemed off. I will say a great thing that came with our booking was a couple of games and photo booth tickets which everyone enjoyed! Overall it was a great night for our guests and I would recommend it if you are hosting an event. I would also love to go back and just enjoy the restaurant itself. Thanks Drake One Fifty :)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was quite busy so I was really happy that my friend had made a reservation. 
I opted for the Drake breakfast which was super filling. Each component of the breakfast was great, and I like how each piece had a unique flavour to it. For example, the mushrooms weren't just standard mushrooms, but were prepared in a very light, sweet sauce. Same with the potatoes - they weren't just standard salty potatoes. They also had a \"flavour\" to it too.  The tomato was lightly charred, the sausages not too salty, the bacon nice and thick. But the showstopper was the cornbread. Absolutely delicious! 
The food is 5/5 but I was really put off by the price so -1 star for that. 
Then again, this is downtown Toronto, so perhaps I am being a bit harsh?"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday pretty late into the night. Place was very empty and surprisingly quiet. 

There were couple people working at the bar and two waitresses/servers that I saw. We arrived right before last call for food so we decided to just grab some drinks.

As someone who LOVES gin..I always order g&t no matter where I go. But they had this Drake's G&T that caught my eyes..a slightly different, fruitier twist to the regular g&t. I ordered one and immediately fell in love (and I am usually very very picky with drinks). Obviously, one's never enough...

Service on the other hand was terribly slow. I probably waited for a good 15 minutes every time I asked for another drink when the place is nearly empty.

Will definitely revisit for Drake's G&T!!!"}
{"text":"I'm confused about the negative reviews. This is got to be one of the best designed restaurants I've ever seen. The food is exceptional and The service was fantastic. Is it pricey for something's yes but the ambience and it's location is premium."}
{"text":"Food was great, but felt like I should wear running shoes to get through the meal.   First two courses came together?   Oysters and Meatballs...  Hot and cold?   No lineup behind us, you'd think they could spread out the food?   I was literally still chewing my last bite of the apps and the main course came out.   
The only reason the rating is so high is the food was great, but I don't like to feel like I'm being rushed out the door when I'm eating."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to meet up. Interesting cocktails and great service. It's a bit pricey but most downtown places are."}
{"text":"This review pertains to TWILIGHT TUESDAYS at Drake One Fifty, not the restaurant itself. 

Twilight Tuesdays is a mini-market that happens during August at the parkette next to Drake One Fifty (west side of York St. between Richmond and Adelaide). It is hosted by Drake One Fifty and Momofuku. 

The market is open every Tuesday in August from 5-9 pm. 

The area outside of the restaurant is transformed into a night market, showcasing gourmet market food, a mini-bar, hip DJ and indie music. 

Stalls sell food from Pizzeria Libertto, Richmond Station, Thoroughbred Food & Drink, Drake One Fifty and Momofuku, all for only $5 per item with all proceeds going to Out of the Cold program at St. Andrew's Church (my charity has partnered with this non-for-profit before, so I can personally vouch for the good work they do). 

I would highly recommend the Paneto Stuffed with polpette fritti from Pizzeria Libertto. Very appetizing. The sangria from the bar is also artfully made, with a good blend of fruit with wine. 

A quick look at the food the vendors are selling: 

Pizzeria Libertto: A3 Napoli Frittatina with marinara sauce, Paneto Stuffed with polette fritti

Smoke Signals Bar-B-Q: Brisket Canapes with beef brisket bill pickle on white bread, Spare Rib, Smoked Chicken Wing 

Drake One Fifty: Fried chicken & pineapple, Grilled corn with smoked curry butter, Pulled pork on a bun 

Cover is free and as mentioned previously, all items are ONLY $5. 

Twilight Tuesday offers phenomenal, affordable food for an extremely good cause. Next Tuesday (August 26th) is the last day Twilight Tuesday is open, so if you haven't checked it out yet, PLEASE do go."}
{"text":"This was our choice of restaurant for a date night while in Toronto and it was definitely a good choice. While it was a little on the pricey side the atmosphere and quality of the food and service made up for that. We had gin cocktails to start both were refreshing and not overly sweet. We had the beef tartare with sourdough bread to share and that was very tasty , lots of flavour and great bite to the meat. As the main course I had the lamb pasta (the lamb was flavourful and well cooked , the Swiss shard was so tasty and the pasta was so light and perfectly cooked it was absolutely delicious ! and my boyfriend had the special of the night which was soft shell crab with sweet corn risotto. The crab was fresh and seasoned Cajun style and the risotto was creamy and well cooked and was perfect with the sweet corn.  We were too full for dessert but they had some interesting items to choose from as well as various coffees and teas. Great date restaurant but It would also accommodate a group. Great chic but not overly posh decor with lots of room for seating and romantic lighting. The service was also attentive quick and efficient. This is a nice spot for a special occasion or a romantic one on one night out !"}
{"text":"Dinner at the Drake One Fifty reminded me that I really need to start looking for a job that includes an expense account.  

We ordered the Tartare ($16) for starters, followed by mains - Pickerel ($26) and the One Fifty Burger ($21).  Also a bottle of the reasonably priced Fat Banker Chardonnay ($40).

Food was pretty good.  Tartare was so soft, so buttery and my pickerel was one fine piece of fish (and I don't say that too often).

For dessert, we shared a piece of the Lemon Tart ($9) which in hindsight, I wished I would have ordered my own.  

Service was prompt and friendly.  

I'll be back when I get clients that need to be wooed with dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I would put this mostly as a 3.5 star review cause the food and value wasn't a true 4 but damn... did they ever make a great atmosphere for a fantastic Sunday brunch with live jazz band.  So I'm bumping this up to a 4.

After seeing several mediocre reviews for brunch, I was hesitant to come but after seeing the friendly smile from our waitress and hearing the jazz band tune up at 11 am, I felt all my concerns were going to go away.  The space is eclectic and modern.  It offers very comfortable seating without it being overly loud.  The large big windows give so much light and makes the room quite vibrant.  As mentioned, our waitress was great.  I did notice the other tables being served by a gentlemen who may have exhibited some of the slower and nonchalant hipster attitude.  We got none... zero... zip. She was always pleasant, topping coffee quickly, and clearing plates.

As for the food... I do agree with the sentiments that this is a bit on the expensive side.  I got the Trevisio salad ($15) and it was the same amount of vegetables as my tiny overpriced side at El Catrin.  So I wasn't understanding how this could be $15. As for flavour, it was good but not great.  I also got the hashbrowns... it wasn't bad but could be more crispier.  The cinnamon beignet were ok... they were more cake doughnuts instead of a fluffy cloud of deep fried goodness. The coffee butter was just... butter.  The one saving amazing thing that was eaten was the gigantic and incredible Drake Breakfast.  I swear this looks like something out of the Flintstones where it's insanely big bacon, 2 links of sausage, 2 well cooked eggs, large delicious corn bread, and even crackling!

I think the atmosphere, service, and the one breakfast dish makes this place stand out among it's Toronto brunch spots.  I think I'll come back to try other dishes to see if my 2 choices were just terrible. Hopefully it will be."}
{"text":"Drake 150 is part of the Drake group comprised of two other eateries and a hotel. This restaurant is found in Toronto's financial district serving fine and upscale meals with stylish leather booths. We reserved this through OpenTable with a sitting of 2 1/2 hours on a heavily booked Friday night. We arrived late due to traffic but stayed a bit more  than 3 hours.

 We were accompanied by some of our friends whom we hadn't  seen in a while, so this layover was much alpreciated...big tip..My partner  in crime ordered her usual Red Chauvignon while I tried  one of their coktail favs. 

We tried cod cakes formed like a pizza with a healthy does of marinated brussel sprouts( a bit ordinary for the price).

I ordered their New York 9 oz steak while some of
got cod fish and chicken. The steak wasn't surprising typical but their fish was super nice. The crispy chicken was presented on a butchers slab with it's accompying vegs.

The service was awesome. We always had our water filled throughout the night.

They also have a photo booth which you normally find in wedding receptions or events. On Friday and Saturday evenings a deejay plays trendy mixes during dinners or cocktails. Great for groups! $$$-$$$$"}
{"text":"Atmosphere/decor: pretty nice and not lifeless and sterile a la Cactus Club Cafe, which is a big plus.

Food: had the wild boar chop. Not bad, but still a bit disappointing. The meat had just the right amount of fat (which saved it) but felt under seasoned and generally a bit bland. The meat portion was generous, but the blandness made it almost hard to finish. The gnocchi was just \"meh\": texture was off (too tough/chewy) and also lacking in flavour. My buddy had a pizza which looked pretty good though.

I'd go back and give them another try based on the rest of their menu and atmosphere.

(Note: rating is entirely based on food and atmosphere. The service was fine but unremarkable and neither hurts nor helps.)"}
{"text":"Was here for brunch this morning after my family ran in the Waterfront Marathon and could not say enough good things about it! They were able to accommodate our reservation for 7 people and we were all so thrilled with our food. I had the hot salmon benedict and it was exactly what I was hungry for, so delicious. 

The decor is really the special part of it all, however. Such beautiful green booths and gold detailing. I wish I lived in Toronto to be able to go more often. 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails ...tasty whiskey sour. Attentive bar staff sommelier bartender has good wine tips without pretense. Nonna's meatballs are old world goodness pork and veal combo with perfectly seasoned sauce (get a side of their delicious sourdough) to mop up that sauce."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. Nice decor, but the seating they gave us for a large group of 14 was so awkward--terrible side benches to sit on and people were very uncomfortable. Service was just average with the waiter forgetting my drink and water request a couple of times once the place was packed to the extreme.

For food to share, the oysters and olives were good. The scallops were too little for the price. And I came down with SEVERE stomach flu after getting home. The doctor said I couldn't be sure what caused it. It could have been the scallops (I think it was since I was the only one who ate it and I was the only one who fell sick) or even unwashed cutlery or water. Either case I'm quite sure it was from this place.

With Keg and Earls around the corner, I don't think I'll head back here."}
{"text":"Had drinks with a friend here and I could see the appeal of the hipster/retro decor inside. I like the drake and this was an interesting spin on it. It wasn't really my style but it was novel and different which was nice. 

There was a nice patio outside and it was really busy and it was filled with suits. I've heard good things about this place from friends and apparently this is the place to hang after work but I thought it was just okay. Ambience was laid back, music was good, drinks were good. Our server was nice, but quite absent most of the time as it was quite busy. 

We also ordered the tartare that came with wasabi chips that was pretty good and the fries were delicious as well. At $80 for drinks with snacks for two people it was okay and comparable to the drake hotel. 

I still prefer the patio at the drake hotel to this place but it was overall a good experience and I would come back again."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! It was jam packed on a Wednesday night, but likely due to the conference being hosted at the Hilton around the corner. We made reservations a week in advance - just to be sure! My friend and I both had the beet salad to start; I had the duck breast and confit leg, and my friend had the gnocchi with greens. Everything was delicious! The Gin Gin cocktail was yummy!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous mid century seating, and decor. 

Cushy turnstyle chairs line the bar as do mini accent lamps. Did not sample their food. Cocktails sampled were delicious!

Great ambiance perfect for an intimate conversation. Bartenders were attentive and friendly. 

Head in for a few drinks and take a gander at their set up. An interior designers dream."}
{"text":"Was looking through old photos from my work trip in Toronto and I can't believe I forgot about this place! Although the restaurant has Drake in the name, it actually was there before champagnepapi haha. Anyways, great food and drinks! I had the Hawaiian personal pizza (roughly $14-$16) and it was to die for. Thin crust, lots of flavor and the perfect size. The unique thing about their pizza is that they give you big pair of scissors to cut your pie. Fun fact: Hawaiian pizza originated in Canada. 

Atmosphere was also very cool - lots of quotes on the outside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to get cocktails downtown. Even when all the tables are full, there's usually room at the bar. Their desserts are to die for.

When everything is packed for brunch, this is the spot to go. No one else thinks to come to the financial district on a weekend.

The outside seating can feel a little dark after sunset. Maybe you'll find it romantic. I prefer this as a spot for small groups, since it can be tough to hear soft-spoken friends over the music.

As I've become more and more obsessed with cooking, a lot of my old favorite spots no longer feel worth going to. I'm never going to feel that way about the menu at the Drake. It's inventive and fun.

Living downtown, I very much appreciate not having to make my way over to the West side for amazing food and a great bar to hang out at."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5*

Situated in the heart of the Financial District, The Drake's Drake One Fifty, recently launched their weekend brunch. Chef de Cuisine, Jon Pong, and his team has created a menu to celebrate the season's light flavors and bountiful produce that support many local purveyors and farmers. The menu includes brunch favorites like eggs benedict, pancakes, skillet French toast, and steak & eggs. Last weekend, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate tasting where guests got to sample the new brunch menu, and completed a hands-on cocktail masterclass (Caesar) with their head mixologist.

Drake One Fifty uses locally sourced products daily, and this hasn't changed with their new brunch menu. They source bacon and pork from Perth Pork, beef from Cumbrae's, walnuts from 100km Foods Inc., cheese from The Cheese Boutique, Ocean Wise sustainable seafood, seasonal Ontario produce and even foraged mushrooms. Quality dishes are of the utmost importance at Drake One Fifty, and this is evident in the dishes that are served to their customers. 
  
The team at Drake One Fifty has also curated a cocktail program that perfectly complemented the new brunch menu including the popular Classic Drake Caesar.

The Blueberry Scones ($11) - clotted cream & jam was a delicious start to a morning brunch. The scones are freshly baked in-house every morning, and delightfully soft.

I opted for the Omelette ($16) - Bulgarian feta, grilled shiitake furikake, baguette crostin, as my choice of main course, and I am glad that I did. The omelette was a modern take on the brunch favorite, but they did add a unique spin to it by adding Bulgarian feta.

Brunch is available every Saturday and Sunday from 11 am to 3 pm at Drake One Fifty (150 York St, Toronto, ON).

{"text":"Maybe I am just not good at choosing food off menus, but shouldn't every item be good? I came here for dinner with a bunch of friends and yes, we were a large party (maybe 20 people?) but still that doesn't mean the service should suffer. I had the seafood chowder, $30. Was it good? Well, it was ok. Worth $30? No. Two of my friends shared the big bird and wow...it was a real juicy chicken. But again, worth $50? No. Service was mediocre, at best. My water glass was filled sometimes and our server dropped a shell on my lap when taking my bowl away. And of course an 18% gratuity was added automatically. It was super dark in there, too. I'm going to give this place 2 stars because the chicken was real good, and the washroom was nice but everything else? Standard financial district food, mediocre service...I won't be back."}
{"text":"Duck prosciutto, Beef Tartare and the Brussels Sprouts (seriously)!"}
{"text":"I am impressed by the raft of restaurants that have opened up in the Financial District, and the Drake 150 I love the food, extensive list of wines, and ambience.  I came here for a lunch and for drinks after work, and the service was friendly and knowledgeable.   There is also a great selection of food for every palate (my favourite is the lamb belly ragu).   Portions are a bit on the smaller side, but I suppose if you are here for a power lunch, the last thing you want is something massive!  

The only thing that I would say is a bit strange is that when you walk into this restaurant, there is a strange \"us vs them\" feeling.  All the clientele is dressed in suits, and the staff are all hipsters - it is like you have walked through the looking glass."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations for the patio. Try the cheesecake choux with rhubarb. It's nothing like a cheesecake, but it's delish! The lamb neck pasta was yummy, but very filling. I fell asleep at my desk in the afternoon... You've been warned."}
{"text":"Went to Drake One Fifty after our reservations at another place fell through. We had Nonna's meatballs to start, which were fantastic, but too small for the price (14$). Three meatballs that were maybe golf ball sized? No self respecting Nonna would make those! In any case, they were still delicious. I then had the Torchetti, while my boyfriend had the Short Rib burger. The Torchetti was great, with just a simple aglio e olio sauce and some confit cherry tomatoes. Small portion again for the price (21$) was my issue here. The short rib burger, from what I hear, was fantastic.

Overall, the food was good but overpriced. The decor was nice, and we had no trouble getting a table. I don't think I'd return just based solely on the price."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant twice to make sure I gave it a fair chance. I will not be coming back. 

My first visit was just before the ballet. The octopus was overcooked, the burrata was not memorable, and the portions were generally quite small for the price. 

I went back again yesterday to be thoroughly disappointed. We waited for 45mins even with a reservation. The hostess was not apologetic and seemed annoyed when we checked in on our table.

The octopus again was overcooked, the burger was overly greasy and the bottom was soggy. The liver and onions lacked flavour and did not look appetizing. It was also so loud, that we had trouble hearing ourselves.

If we had gone to the Keg across the street instead, we would have eaten sooner and had a better time, at probably the same price."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and snacks after work one day with my team.  I had a really good time and I really enjoyed the food!

They're generous with the alcohol in their drinks, which I'm sure some people appreciate.  Their white sangria was nice.

Their charcuterie plate was DELICIOUS.  Great selection of cured meats.  The duck prosciutto was deliciously salty and rich but oddly less fatty than regular pork prosciutto - but maybe I just like the taste of duck fat better.  The smoked salami was savoury heaven - I can't remember what meat it was but it might have been bison or venison.  The pepperoni was good (though I'm not really a pepperoni person).  It was served with a delicious whole grain mustard.  And the terrine was pretty awesome as well - salty and savoury and mild (i.e. not organ-y).  Also served with pickles, which I didn't touch.

We had some kind of a seafood dip.  It was AMAZING.  It was creamy and salty, with generous hunks of crab and fatty fish (cod, maybe?) inside.  It was topped with a browned cheese - either asiago, parmesan, or grana padano, I'm not sure.  But this was wonderful.

We also had an octopus appetizer that was heavenly.  The sauce it came in was perfection - creamy and garlicky and exquisitely spiced.  The octopus was also cooked just right - not raw and slimy, not cooked and rubbery.

And then we had a margherita pizza, which was alright.  The crust was paper thin and kinda burnt, though it was kinda charming that it was served with scissors.  Nothing special though.  

We also ordered fries, which were so-so.

Service was very, very good.  Our server had bright, kool-aid blue hair and was tattooed all over!  Very attentive and accommodating service, even though we had confusing billing requests.

Great experience - I'm going to save up my pennies and come back!"}
{"text":"Food is just OK but the drinks are superb!  Servers are very knowledgeable and astute as well."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant!! The decor and location is GREAT! It really adds character to the financial district!! 

My BFB and I went there on a Saturday. Fortunately for us, we made a reso and got a pretty nice table!! 

- We love the ambience. It gets a little loud when there's a live band, but the music was nice!!
- We shared a cauliflower and kale appy... It's simple, but tasty!! Then we ordered the braised boar pasta and the muscles et frites!! Everything was delish!!
- For dessert, we shared a toffee pudding with a scoop of rosemary ice cream and a scoop of earl grey ice cream!! To die for!!
- Service was commendable as well!! The lovely lady (I'm sorry I forgot her name) was wonderful!! She made a great recommendation on a Spanish wine and we thoroughly enjoyed that bottle!!

Yes, I'm a fan and would highly recommend Drake 150!!"}
{"text":"Good service & average food & good space for a group. We tried oysters & puttanesca pizza & both pasta dishes - everything was average. It's a big place with lots of space and a hip ambiance but nothing special."}
{"text":"Recently went to Drake One Fifty for their weekend brunch. Made reservations ahead of time but when I got there the restaurant was not packed at all (probably because it was more hidden on a less busy street). My friend and I decided to sit out on the patio on a gorgeous sunny day.

We ordered both the red/white sangrias and both had the hot smoked salmon benny. Out of both sangrias we both agreed that the red sangria tasted better. The benny was well done...perfectly cooked poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. What was unique about this benny was the salmon roe which worked well with the rest of the dish. The benny also game with an arugula salad and definitely filled us up.

The service was attentive and great. Our waitress didn't rush us as we sat for a while drinking our sangrias."}
{"text":"Yep, this was a 3 star experience.  Inside, the setup and atmosphere is great.  Good expansive bar and some booths and tables to accomodate groups.

I was meeting some co-workers and got a bit of attitude from the hostess.  Not a big deal, but completely unnecessary as I had no clue which one of my 6 co-workers put their name in.  No problem ai just bypassed the middle(wo)man and found my co-workers.

Food was decent.  The pizza with prosciutto was delightfully light amd crispy.  I would definitely get it again.  The meatballs had good sauce but were otherwise uneventful, and the charcuterie was pretty good.

The drinks were ok, but I have to agree with my co-worker who pointed out that a $16 old fashioned should have a giant square ice cube, not a bunch of little ice cubes.  Picky, I know, but for that price the little things matter.  Beer was of course cold and delicious.

Server and service were good but not great.

There you have it.  3 stars for pricey and underwhelming."}
