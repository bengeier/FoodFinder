{"text":"Personally i feel like it's a bit over priced and service can be long but besides that the sushi is really good and fresh. I also wish there was more parking but if you just do take out its not a problem. Now all they need is a more detailed menu for takeout and this place will be a top favorite in laval."}
{"text":"This quant little restaurant welcomed you right from the start. Our experience, a party of 4 was simple and unanimous, excellent service, great sushi, and a wonderful ambiance...what else do you want when you dine out."}
{"text":"Sans réservation on nous dit que pour ce soir ce n'est pas possible. Le Resto est presque vide , mais on m'explique qu'il y a trop de commande à emporter.... Le Resto viens de refuser une facture de minimum 120$ ,nous étions que trois M'avertir que le service seras long aurait-été plus professionnel . C'est autre Resto qui a bénéficié de mon argent Je n'y retournerais plus! Mois douze étoile!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places for sushi. Bad service . The open menu they advertise is a chef selection; so  you eat what they decide for you. We stopped for a sushi meal with kids after work . We wanted something good and well priced. We end up paying a lot and not being full ; a 13$ special role that is smaller than a simple nigiri in fast food style sushi. I will never return to that place and will not recommend it to people i know."}
