{"text":"Good solid pizza place! Tasty food with good service. It's self service, but the food is tasty, and the service is fast! If you are in the area definitely stop in for a slice or a pie."}
{"text":"I ordered from Jackson's US pizza through GrubHub. The order arrived early but what was most impressive was the quality. I ordered a personal pizza and appetizer sampler. The fries, onion rings and mozzarella sticks were hot but not soggy, and seasoned to perfection. Not just deep fried nastiness. The pizza was made to order, my request was met without a problem. I can't express enough how delicious it was. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza place ever. They have fresh ingredients (including mushrooms)! They're wings are perfect sizes and their sauce oh so good!!!! They serve hamburgers, hot sandwiches, salads, breadsticks even hot dogs! They have caramel flavored churros (AMAZING)!!! Finally a very good pizza place near arrowhead mall area!!!"}
{"text":"I order from here quite frequently. I accept the horrible delivery issues because my teens love the food. But I'm tired of it today and need to let everyone know. I have ordered online 3 times and each time I had to call the store after a hour wait, and ask about my order, each time they acted like they hadn't received the order. So I decided to call in our order today in hopes we would get it in a timely manner. Well no, I have been waiting 1 hour and 25 minutes, as of now I'm still waiting, for our order. So I call, and guess what!? The driver took a order before ours, so yeah...we just have to wait I guess, because when I asked questions, the young lady on the phone was so busy she didn't hear my questions, so I just hung up. I have never once been offered a refund, discount, coupon, anything for their horrible wait times, and of course my orders have been messed up. I tried very hard not to complain, because my teens love the food. Well today was the last straw. I would recommend going to the store and buying the supplies and making your own food before waiting on these guys to deliver, correctly and promptly. Sad."}
{"text":"I usually call in my order and pick up, but sometimes I order delivery and these guys are great. Very friendly, haven't had any issues with receiving our order and the best part is that the pizza is really good. Very solid neighborhood pizzeria with inexpensive, good tasting pizza. 

My husband loves the cheese, which is always very generously applied on the pizzas and just tastes so fresh and good. I also like that they have bacon, since some places just have Canadian bacon, which is NOT what I want on my pizza.

I will say that you shouldn't waste your time ordering the mozzarella sticks, as they literally didn't taste like anything, other than maybe grease. Also, the garlic knots are really nothing special. Even the kids won't eat them.  But the wings are good and they have different flavors as well, which we enjoy. 

So if you're looking for a good, cheap neighborhood pizza place, this is a good spot for pick up or delivery. Nothing fancy, just good pizza and wings."}
