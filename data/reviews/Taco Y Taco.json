{"text":"Do not EVER eat here!!! Or the tacos at least. I went with a friend of mine and her sister. I got tacos and they got other menu items. I am just getting over a 36hr food poisoning! The food wasn't even that good. I have had way better tacos. The people I went with weren't impressed either. Do not waste your time or risk your health at this place!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here while in town and glad we did. If there was a taco y taco in my hometown, I'd eat there regularly. The asada and carnitas tacos were very tasty. I also had a vampiro for the first time. It was outstanding, as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! Tacos pastor is the best in town and their salsa bar is delicious!"}
{"text":"Best al pastor n lengua.  Don't be intimidated. ..just walk up to the windows n they will give samples."}
{"text":"Grey food and friendly employeez! Carlos has a great customer service attitude evwrytime we come eat tacos al pastor he has a smile and makes us laugh!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat here for lunch and YES! it is great. Had an Al Pastor burrito with the works for $6.00. The meat was so tender and tasty, the pico de gallo and beans were fresh and flavorful. Today was their 6 month mark so tonight I went back with the kids for $1 tacos. We had chorizo, carnitas, and asada. All were very good but our favorite was the chorizo. Corn on the cob with mayo, cheese and chile is the only way to it and for $2 each we had two. Out of all the Mexican places we've ate at around town this one has the best salsa bar. There were at least 7 to choose from and there were grilled peppers and onions both hot and cold. Limes and carrots are pretty much standard but cucumbers, whole and cut radishes were a bonus. Love this place and will be back for more soon."}
{"text":"Great food Great Vibe ! And Affordable too!  few people ordered Corn on the Cob so I followed suit ..sorry don't really like it - smothered in something and topped with Mexican cheese ..,needs salt"}
{"text":"We really liked this place.   The Al Pastor really shined.   Carnitas were good and Asada average.   The Street corn was a nice change you can't get very many places.

It just lacks the dive feel.   It is new, bright and clean inside."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place since it's close by and had so many good reviews.  The tacos al pastor were good, but unfortunately they got cold while we waited for the shrimp tacos to cook (in hindsight we should have waited for the shrimp tacos to be done before ordering anything else because it took quite a while).  Unfortunately, the chicken in the chicken taco was so burned that half of the serving was essentially inedible charcoal.  The shrimp tacos were good and flavorful and so was the guacamole.  Some other reviews commented on the loud music, but it was fine when we were there.  Overall it was ok but we aren't excited about returning."}
{"text":"At first I was a little confused with how the place was set up, where to order what I wanted. The staff was okay, chatting with each other while I looked around. Finally a cook explained the set up. I had the vegetarian tacos and my boyfriend had chicken tacos. Flavors were good. salsa bar was overwhelming, I wish they would label the 8 different salsa. Mexican corn was beyond good. Dj playing in the corner on Saturday night was a great surprise.  Planning on coming back again."}
{"text":"If your looking for some legit street tacos Taco y Taco is spot to be. Although when we arrived we weren't sure where to line up because there are different stations. They should put some signs up for first timers. 

I ended up getting 3 tacos the Al pastor and 2 lengua tacos. The Al pastor taco was okay not my favorite. However, they have the best Mexican style corn. I highly recommend trying it if you want some legit Mexican corn."}
{"text":"This place is very good. I've gone many times and have never had a serious problem with any of the dishes I've tried. They offer authentic Mexican \"street\" food that's delicious and one of the best salsa bars in Vegas. I highly recommend the al pastor tacos, the vampiros, and the horchata!

Unfortunately they're making the common mistake of raising their prices too quickly while also seemingly reducing their portion sizes. That may boost profits temporarily but it will backfire in the end, especially among regular customers. There are way too many other good Mexican places in the valley, and if I'm going to spend $45+ on lunch for two it probably won't be at Taco y Taco.

Also, their ordering system is overly complicated and some of their employees are easily confused. Be sure to double-check your bill as I've had \"mystery charges\" show up on my bill twice."}
{"text":"Bad Remarks first. Their menu and ordering system is very confusing and counter staff was not helpful, until the cashier helped.

I spent bank on nice restaurants in Vegas and hit Taco y Taco on the way out of town, entirely by accident. OMG! Their food is off the charts, delicious, excellent, just can't say enough good. I am from Houston who boasts a strong Latino population and my wife is Latina. But WOW....seriously....Taco y Taco makes every other cook or chef that makes this cuisine look like they don't know what they're doing. I came to the conclusion, after eating, that their ordering and menu system is designed for regulars because a place that great likely never sees newcomers, just a stream of loyal regulars. Makes consider moving to Vegas.

Folks, their prices are good, their service is good, and if  you ask for help from the cashier about their ordering process then you're in for a treat. The best of the best and by quite a bit."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas/Henderson area. This one is much better than Chipotle, Taco Bell and Robertos Restaurants. Everything's sooo fresh and delicious.. I'm glad I even try than never.. I'm glad I went and taste their food as a first timer. Its so Darn delicious with full of flavors..  Whoooooooooo....... You gotta give Taco y Taco a chance!! I will be going again in Henderson area this weekend!!"}
{"text":"If good tasting tacos is what you are looking for you found them here, but if good service is what you want don't step in here. Takes long to get your food, by the time you have payed for it it's already cold. Poor service other than that good f*cking tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Don't let the decor fool you, great vibes and music. 

Love the unique drink selection.

Will come back!"}
{"text":"this place is famazing!!!! best corner taco shop ever!! Whatever you are in the mood for... everything is good! Service is fast and courteous no matter how busy they are!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had!! Such unique/authentic flavors. My new favorite spot! Also, my margarita was on point!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant for a few months.  Some are highly rated but not really that good.  Finally found good food here at Taco Y Taco.  The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Fresh, and authentic Mexican food. Friendly staff too. If you like tacos you must try this place. Everything  is prepared in front of you while you wait. The other Mexican food joints can't compete with taco y taco ."}
{"text":"Incredible! Helpful staff, super clean, a wide variety of awesome food on a simple menu, and a stocked salsa bar!
One of the best tacos I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Staff was great and friendly . The food was amazing . Great variety of salsas i had to try them all seriously . I would highly recommend this place if your in the area ."}
{"text":"This place had the best tacos in Henderson love the elotes and the fresh tacos de pastor."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos, the selection of meats and vegetarian options are great. Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. Great beer selection on tap too!"}
{"text":"This taco spot is the best taco place I've been to if you love tacos or burritos as much as my friend and I believe me this is the place to be Dj and all the music the food bomb"}
{"text":"Really like it .... First you order what kind of taco , burrito , bowl etc... In different line then after you can pay at the cashier . I like that its fresh  really love the corn !!!!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious, but I also feel good after I eat it.  Tacos aren't health food, but at Taco Taco they actually make food from scratch.  No frozen sysco food trucks make deliveries here.  The workers here take pride in what they do and it shows.  The salsa bar is incredible.  Only negative is figuring out the ordering, which is a little confusing on your first visit.  However, the people who work here are so helpful and friendly that even that slight negative really doesn't matter."}
{"text":"this restaurant has great food.. tacos are amazing. but the one thing that i keep coming back for is the corn on the cob (mexican street style). its so amazing. you cant go wrong with anythibg on the menu.. 

there is one small complaint i do have though. yesterday i had gone there to pick up lunch for my office. all the food was set up and i had paid for everything. the lady who had rang me up.. first asked if i wanted a bag for my large order. she then told me to wait a munute while she had to put ice in the ice machine and i understand that maybe that had beem something that needed to get filled.. but couldnt she have had asked someone else from the back to do it for her?  instead it took her an additional 10 mins before i got my actual order packed. i had asked her and the other guys in the back for my order. but i wasnt awknowledged. i then asked for the manager and she said she was... this kind of service is unacceptable. she didnt say sorry for the long wait or anything. needless to say.. if this one particular employee is working.. i will not be eating there and im gonna be telling everyone i know about it.

other than this bad experience ... food is great nd service is ok."}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco had some amazing food. The place was clean and very helpful and happy employees. It was a little confusing on how to order but once it was explained it was easy. I highly recommend this eatery...."}
{"text":"This new taco bar/cocktail bar concept..is brilliant!  When my girlfriend mentioned that we were headed to meet friends for dinner and we were going to Taco y Taco, I imagined the normal small taco shack with great food as you would find at their other location, with underwhelming decor.  
I was overwhelmed when I entered Taco y Taco on Eastern. This place is big, two levels with plenty of seating and you'll want to spend some time here.  It has a nice ambiance with cool modern chandelier lighting and dark accents.  It's a surprise that their tacos are still only 2.25!?! 
We sat at the bar waiting for friends.  We had some happy hour beers and the bartenders were super nice.  Once we got around to eating, we went through the taco bar.  I had 3 tacos: one al pastor, a carne and a carnitas.  My fave of the 3 was the carnitas.  I wasn't overly impressed by the al pastor.  I've definitely had better.  My gf had tripa, lengua and an al pastor.  She seemed to enjoy them and had the same feelings about the al pastor. This is definitely a great spot for something quick, something slow and some late night dining.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials at this place between 5 and 7 you can get great nachos. Then you can walk next door and have ice cream. What a healthy All-American meal. The only negative here is the ordering process which is so ridiculous unless you know exactly where to go. That's why I gave it 5 stars for the happy hour special but I know exactly where to go. If I order anything different because I'm going to have to  the stars for the ordering process. Good luck"}
{"text":"Good food, lots of different items with deep, rich flavors. Great staff, prices are a bit steep, but it's location in a trendy Henderson strip mall with lots of eating options almost forces their prices to be higher. Good bar selection, lots of seating. Can get crowded during lunch and dinner hours and the individual lines for different menu items doesn't help the matter. Tacos el Gordo is my preference, but this place holds up fairly well."}
{"text":"The food was good prices were great. But customer service mediocre. You wait is several lines for you food depending on what type of tacos/burritos you want so if you like  a variety your in for waiting in line. We waited in two different lines which was about 25 mins so when we sat to eat our food it was cold. The chips were anything but authentic!! Tacos were great but would have been better hot. I won't be back unless I am getting to go and don't care if my food is cold"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, upstairs seating and a salsa bar. Fresh meat cooked right before your eyes and they even have vegetarian options. Try the fish tacos there to die for. Make sure you get them loaded. Fresh corn on the cob street cart style and a cold beer to wash it all down. YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, small portions, pricey, confusing ordering system on the first visit."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food is fresh and great tasting. 
Made right before your eyes, with real ingredients."}
{"text":"Did not know where to go order until a friend pointed out the individual stations.  So many different types of meat you can chose for your tacos!  I got the al pastor and tripas tacos and they were delicious.  Carne asada fries were good and not too oily.  They tasted fine the next day as well.  Salsa bar was clean and abundant, however the salsas were not labeled.  I'm used to spicy condiments (the hotter the better) and like surprises, but some of my friends cannot handle spicy salsa.  I would return for the tacos."}
{"text":"Most of the time the tacos are great, good attention to detail. Then once in a while it'll just be sloppy and unbalanced ingredients. Stay away from the bowls and burrito, not enough to justify the price."}
{"text":"When my husband I got married we celebrated with a small party at our home, which was catered by Taco y Taco. We placed the order a few weeks in advance, paid for it, and received a confirmation email from them. The food was to be delivered at 5:00 (which is also the time the party started, since I didn't want to serve my guests cold food). At 5:00 my husband calls just to make sure they were on their way or close to it. When he calls, they tell him that they forgot the order all together and that it would be a little late. There was no apology or effort to make up for the fact that we had a house full of guests waiting for food which they forgot to make. We had no choice but to wait for them as the food had already been paid for and it was too late for alternative arrangements. They managed to get the food to us around 5:45, and it all tasted just fine. In their rush to get the order filled, they didn't bring the right amount of tortillas and they left out a salsa. The day after the party I called to speak with someone about what had happened. I felt like more of an effort should have been made to apologize and make up for their mistake. They offered us 1 free meal. This requires us to visit their establishment and to pay for a second meal. In my opinion this did not make up for the fact that they completely forgot about our order. We asked to speak to the manager and they refused. We asked to speak to the owner, and the woman I spoke to said the owner wouldn't be in for a few days and that he would say the same thing anyway. I continued to call over the next few days to try to get a hold of a manager or owner. They continued to give me the run around. They were rude and unprofessional. I have waited a few weeks to write this review to give them an opportunity to make it right, but I'm tired of calling them. It's unfortunate that they don't care about customer service. We used to eat there all the time, but will no longer be visiting their establishment, along with all of the guests at are party who witnessed firsthand their unprofessionalism.  

Long story short: Poor customer service, too unorganized to properly run a catering service."}
{"text":"Great food! Al Pastor, carne asada, carnitas = delicious. Great salsa bar, always fresh and tasty. Food is prepared fresh in front of you. Their ordering system could be fine tuned but overall the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"First time trying the place after repeatedly passing it, and happy I stopped in! The ordering process was a little bit awkward but the food made up for it. I got chicken tacos and my boyfriend got adobada and carne asada tacos, which all tasted authentic. The only reason for the four stars is because of the ordering process and the live mariachi band was a romantic touch- just a little too loud. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here with 2 friends las t night and I was very impressed. I loved the order lines that they had blessed on what type of meant you wanted for your tacos. Prices were also very good! They also have a full bar with 8 different beers I tap which is amazing for a beer lover like myself. I had the care asada tacos which were 2$ a piece. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious tacos and wonderful atmosphere.  Our waiter was great, and we loved that there was a DJ! We enjoyed our girls night out and stopping here was a great idea!"}
{"text":"Ughh why are all the amazing taco places so far from my house? Why must I live on the West side???

This place is further from my place than even Tacos el Gordo, but it's more spacious and less crowded - though that doesn't mean the food sucks. No my dear children - the meat is wonderful. You know how some Mexican taco joints--actually, ALMOST ALL OF THEM-- use cilantro and onion (salsa sometimes too) to mask the flavor of an otherwise unremarkably cooked meat by piling that stuff on? And that when they do that, you're basically eating a cilantro and onion taco with meat filler? Not here. I mean, yes, they have those toppings but for once, you can actually taste tender rich meat. 

I'm always looking for a place that has great lengua. I'm not sure how lots of places seem to fuck it up, but they do - barely cooked, tough, absolutely lacking flavor, barely any meatiness, or all of the above. Tacos el Gordo has amazing lengua, and so does this place. Their suadero and al pastor is also top notch. And don't worry vegetarians, they got you covered - finally a place that serves soyrizo!! My boyfriend is a (cheating) vegan and loves their soyrizo. 

Their salsa bar is a welcome sight for so many of us who are rather tired of choosing between just roja vs verde. It's a salsa lover's dream. Their limes are also good quality - again, sometimes taco places just throw out crappy limes out there to sit on ice all day, or barely even any at all. Haven't tried their jamaica drink yet but their horchata is well-spiced and not watered down.

I'd also urge any future visitors to this place to READ THE SIGNS ON THE TRASH BINS. There's two that specifically state they're not for garbage but for glass bottles, and I've seen people dump their trash in there anyway. 

It might be a good thing this place is so far or else I'd be blowing my money here every few days if I could."}
{"text":"Came here once, out of corn. 2nd time I came, still out of corn. Service is slow, but at least the food was fresh and made to order. Would prefer Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"A demotion to 3 stars for mere lack of good service and the overall way the place is set up. I received no greeting. There are no signs anywhere for where to order. Come to discover, that you order here for 1 thing, there for another, there for another. Its very confusing. I am not a stupid person. I can even understand and speak Spanish enough to get by if I was dropped in the middle of Spain. But, after nearing about 10 minutes of trying to be acknowledged I literally had to almost shout \"I would like to order when someone is ready to take it!\" 

Then I ordered Carnitas Tacos & Chicken Tacos... But, received Carne Asada Tacos & Chicken Tacos. That's OK though, because I do like both.  

Aside from that, the food was actually very very good. It's worth trying, but they need to tighten up their operation a bit."}
{"text":"This place has the best authentic tacos and I think it might be a sister company to Tacos el Gordo and Tacos Tijuana in Las Vegas. If you want AMAZING authentic tacos that are a little on the small size you need to visit one of those taco places. I order at least 3 tacos each time I visit because their tacos are small."}
{"text":"Menu/ ordering is confusing, there isn't really signs to tell you what to do if you are a first time customer. But the staff is very friendly and the food is amazing! The carne Asada tacos are the best! Great new place for real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I've had the luxury of having my first meal from this location. I've picked it based on the reviews and the photos I've saw. Since I'm trying to find a good burrito that reminds me of what I've had in LA for years, I'm trying many locations. I went here for a simple asada burrito.

While it was good, it was also pretty generic. It reminded me of what I was able to get inside a Chipotle but for more expensive. I paid almost $9 for a small burrito and all the toppings & taste were the same. This is not bad but for what you pay, you expect something to knock you out of the park. That did not happen here.

I'm sure other food might taste better but my review is based only on the one burrito I had. It was very clean inside and had a somewhat easy way to place an order."}
{"text":"This place is great. They have all the authentic Mexican food dishes and Hispanic cooks however, the food taste American. There is very little flavor to the food, but it's still good don't get me wrong. I'm just saying if I wanted Mexican \"American\" food I would go to Chipotle! The street corn is awesome and I love their many selections of salsa."}
{"text":"I could live here. Quality mexican food that never dissapoints and great hospitality and layout. Best mexican food I've ever had."}
{"text":"The high quality fresh ingredients, plus the  Mexican preparation style of combining simple fresh and authentic ingredients (cheeses used for toppings, for ex.) for mouthfuls of complex deliciousness make this place. I had 5 different taco varieties and found the meat of each cooked very well, tasty, and the taco toppings perfect combinations. The mole of the mole fries dish was surprisingly good. The guac is unadulterated with chemical additives (of good enough to fool me). The corn on the cob was authentically prepared with typical toppings. I'm so over Roberto's. Other authentic taquerias aren't as refined in the cooking and delivery of the dishes."}
{"text":"This margarita is the best part of my whole meal! So happy to be able to have a drink. I was surprised to see kind of a buffet line. The salsa has my tongue still burnin!"}
{"text":"Amazing place in vegas that is very unique and rare and dont find to much of in vegas. Very unique and eye catching. There food is amazing and the owner is a very mello fun cool guy!"}
{"text":"This was the saltiest food I have ever eaten!!! I wasn't very impressed with the way the place is set up to start with. I felt like I was in line at an amusement park. The different stations are confusing. We thought we would try something simple- tacos. I took one bite and threw my carne asada taco in the trash because it had no flavor or seasoning other than salt. My partner ordered 2 tacos, one carne asada and one al pastor and it was the same thing with the al pastor, no flavor other than salt. She tried to eat them because she was starving but ended up throwing away over half her food. The restaurant was also not clean, the table was sticky and the salsa bar was a mess. I would definitely not recommend eating here unless you have no tastebuds. I will never go back!!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch this afternoon for the first time. Absolutely loved the decor, but that was about it. The set up for ordering makes no sense. Customer service is seriously lacking. Everyone we came in contact with was pretty rude. The food was nothing special. I could get better carne asada from Roberto's for a lot cheaper. I've had a lot of people tell me how good this place was, but I have to say, not impressed"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in a week and both times my stomach and wallet left filled and happy. 

Great customer service and great food. 

Al pastor, al pastor, al pastor. 
 
They have been hooking it up and have a GRAND OPENING coming up on Saturday  Feb 16 with Live Mariachi Music and FREE MEAT Samples."}
{"text":"Im super picky when it comes to burritos & tacos i hadnt found a place in vegas with legit alpastor meat...... we came here on a friday night my hubby , son, & i hubby wantd burgers but i was craving the al pastor burrito after seeing all the great reviews.. goin in we where super confused the ordering process took long & workers ignored us & we just stood there confused like for 5 mins until a lady finally askd from her station & let us know how the whole process worked.... the al pastor meat was already cut and i was eyeballing the one cooking on the rotissere but where told it wasnt done we had to wait 5 more mins & since toddlers are not very cooperative we couldnt wait.... but overall it was very good much like a chipotle but better with more authentic food but really pricy 2.15 a taco & 5 something a burrito that honestly isnt that big"}
{"text":"If your looking for inexpensive authentic Mexican food this is your place!  I recommend the carnita vampiro and Mexican corn on the cob!"}
{"text":"Took my granddaughter to taco y taco around a week ago. We decided to give it a shot after being disappointed by most of the restaurants in the shopping center. Food was good and moderately priced. The place seemed clean. One of the better Mexican restaurants in our area."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian selection! Three filing options for tacos: queso fresco, sautéed mushrooms or soyrizo."}
{"text":"First time I tried Taco y Taco,  I had two shrimp tacos W/ guacamole... I was pleasantly surprised. Chips and salsa too!

The food was fresh and the restaurant was clean!  Please keep it that way!......... And I will be back.

 Do you have a menu online?   Or do I have to wing it whenever I wonder in there?"}
{"text":"I came here when it was fairly new, and I must compare it to Tacos El Gordo. I ended up getting a pork adobada taco, an asada taco, and pork adobada fries. I found this place rather mediocre compared to El Gordo. Their fries were super soggy and, the adobada seemed like it was sitting out for a bit. I honestly can't remember what the tacos tasted like either... Two super pluses is that their sauce bar contains a lot of variety, and their workers are extremely friendly and helpful (At El Gordo, they don't even acknowledge you)."}
{"text":"Everyone just shut up and listen to me for a minute!

:::::Soy chorizo burritos in Las Vegas:::::

Ok, so maybe you don't find this news as exciting as I do but you cannot believe the excitement I have for Taco Taco and their love of vegetarians like me.

Until recently, trying to find veg-friendly, authentic, good Mexican food in this town was like going on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth.  It just didn't exist.  Sure, there were places that list \"vegetarian\" items on their menus, only to tell you that it's full of lard and chicken broth.  Then there are the tex-mex chain restaurants that are veg-friendly but about as authentic as this Italian-Hungarian girl making a burrito.  Taco Taco is The Fountain of Youth.

You have your choice of burritos, tacos, bowls, and salads.  Soy chorizo is available, but for more health-conscious vegetarians you can just stick with beans and veggies.  Speaking of beans, they aren't cooked in lard or pork!  Woot!

The burritos are large and can be stuffed with tons of ingredients.  The tacos have house-made tortillas that are cooked up the second you order them.  Now here comes a dilemma: do you get the burrito that fits tons of extras like rice and beans or do you go for the tacos with their delicious tortillas?  Life can be so cruel.

They also have some special items like soy chorizo tacos that have been grilled (crunchy like a taquito) and topped with spicy salsa and cheese.  Or there are breakfast burritos with potatoes.  Then there's the horchata and Jarritos among the many beverage options.  And did I mention they offer a salsa bar with radishes, pickled veggies, beans, and eight types of salsa??  

Don't you worry, meat-eaters, there are plenty of options for you and I'm sure they are just as good as my soy chorizo.

Just a heads-up, if you follow them on social media you can stay up to date with specials they will throw from time to time, like 2-for-1 tacos on a random Saturday afternoon or a free corn for checking in.

The owners and all the employees are super friendly and helpful.  Despite being on the opposite side of town, I've managed to make the trip out here far too many times.  Rumor has it they are looking for a second location which can be bad news for me if it's near my all my downtown drinking establishments.  Expect me to be 50 pounds heavier if that's the case.

Check this place out! And if you're vegetarian, make sure to tell them thanks for thinking about us!"}
{"text":"Delicious veggie Mexican options, including the mole fries. I'd suggest sitting at the bar during happy hour from 5-7. Their bar manager Christopher is great and can serve you drinks and food there."}
{"text":"So, um...WOW! Okay, they have a limited amount of vegan options, but there is a lot of ways you can order one thing. The gran taco, for example, can have different things on it. I had two gran tacos with soyrizo, black beans, onion, cilantro, pico de gallo and guacamole. 

Listen! This sh*t is finger-licking good. Eat with your hands! They have a little sauce bar by the self-serve fountain drinks - go get you some lime slices and some of them sautéed jalapeños! 

My mouth is watering as I type this. I gave this place four stars only because they don't have many options for vegans, but the options they do have are BOMB AF! 

Anyway, the vegan menu at the top over hanging the shorter end of they bar. Just ask where the vegan menu is just in case they change the place around :) they are nice there, and YES they speak both Spanish and English. 

Have fun! Peace, love, and happy eating"}
{"text":"Taco y taco is a tasty a la carte cafe style joint where you can order as much or as little as you like.  The carnitas (any style) is fantastic,  and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Just relocated from California to Nevada and was looking to go to Taco El Gordo but lines way too long! Found this jewel near my house and I was more than impressed! Guac was Amazeballs, the chicken, steak and al pastor tacos were to me better than el Gordo. The set up was similar with different lines for the meats but there was more variety. Carne Asada fries are my new fave!!! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"If you know good Vegas tacos, then you will know what I mean when I say this place is an awesome combination of Los Tacos and Chipotle.  But cheaper and just as good.  

My coworker and I decided to try this yesterday for lunch, on a whim.  We were a bit confused about where to start the order, but once we figured it out, it was fine.  We ordered the Grande Carne Asada taco, rice and beans, and chips and salsa.  All of it was goooood!   There is a salsa bar with about 6 different salsas to pick from. 

The tacos were big and full of meat.  The staff was super friendly and welcoming.  

Tacos don't get a lot of attention in this celebrity chef, fancy schmancy restaurant market.  But these tacos are good!!  

Why does it get 5 stars?  Because I would return tomorrow to try something else.  Or to order the exact same thing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The margaritas are phenomenal, the staff is super friendly and the food is always fresh. I'm not a huge fan of the mariachi band but it makes for a different atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place to everyone. It's perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"A little slow at times but everything was amazing the elote was great I'm glad I don't have drive into the city to get real Mexican food anymore!.... If only they had churros"}
{"text":"I have been living in Las Vegas now for 1.5 years. One thing that is very apparent is the competition in the trendy restaurant business. We have so many choices and the one thing they should all have a heightened awareness of is consistency, quality and outstanding, superior customer service.  Customer service is the one characteristic alone that we all know brings repeat business to a restaurant. This place certainly gives you a feeling of uncertainty.

  I never write reviews about restaurants but rather give my opinion by word of mouth.  To me it holds more value to personally tell someone an experience, there is a loss of interpretation from reading about it, however my experience at this place was totally beyond unacceptable.  So I had to create this account with YELP just so I could tell the public what a lousy, unfriendly, confusing experience I had.

1 )  First impression
After seeing the hand written sign in the window and waiting for months to try this place I am so disappointed I in my experience. When you walk in to the place there is no sense of direction as to where to start, where to order and no one to greet you or answer questions. Everyone is meandering around trying to figure out how to order their food, one customer asking another do I do?? If they wanted to convey the sense of wandering the streets of a foreign country with street vendors selling food; well they definitely accomplished their goal. I felt like I was at the Swap Meet in North Las Vegas. You have to be a leader and form your own line or be the one to tell everyone else what they have to do to order food, after 5 -10 minutes of deciphering the menu boards that are hung behind the cooks 

2)  The Food
 The tacos were below standard in taste. I had to try 2 of each and the flavors all blended together. There were no real distinct flavors between any of the meets except the Chorizo, it was ok but they are all very small.  I would have been much happier going to Super Burrito than to eat the greasy bland tacos at this place. .  A specialty dish Mole Smothered Fries was displayed with a 8x11 piece of paper, hand written with No Price, and no direction as to who takes the order. I inquired about the special to the closet server to the sign and he had to go ask someone else, he said What Special?? Finally a different server asks me what I needed so I had to repeat myself and he had to get someone else to get it. I did not have a good feeling about what I was going to get since they did not even know about the special. Needless to say it was the worst Mole I ever tasted and had enough salt in it to last me a month.
3) Customer Service & Price
So after eating some of the tacos and smothered fries I bought, I needed another beer. So I looked at my receipt and discovered I was charged $7.00 for a draft beer. I asked the cashier was there a mistake and she had to ask the bartender, he confirmed it was $7. he also said the bottle beer was $3.00 and it was happy hour. Well no one told me it was happy hour and it was not posted for anyone to see. But the one thing that was startling to me was that in the whole beer drinking world the normal Tap Beer  is served at happy hour prices.

So I ask for the manager and an insensitive young lady struts over to my table with an attitude and from her introduction has no manager or professional business skill to begin with.  I explained to her what the situation was and she walked away to reprint my receipt she returned only to reiterate what I already knew.  There was no apology for the lack of customer service from the cashiers not telling people it was happy hour and bottle beer was cheaper. There was no empathy but rather a unprofessional arrogant attitude. 

If I would have experienced one shred of concern or a slight sense or knowledge of customer service from anyone in that Tacos Y Tacos I probably never would have written this review. Yes it's fresh and it is grilled, but there is also Fresh and Crappy taste and service which this place exemplifies!!

 I am very familiar with excellent customer service and this place has failed to produce that quality and I will never go back, there is no value to what they serve."}
{"text":"Hmm well the ppl are all nice but my food was cold once i started eating it (my tortilla and meat)..."}
{"text":"I love this place, but it's way better to go when it's not that busy. It was kind of a s***show with the line. Overall great food. We had elotes and carne asada and pastor tacos. All delicious and they had a great salsa bar. Can't beat the margaritas either! They are delicious and everything is a great value especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal! Street tacos are incredible, burritos are solid and the corn is amazing. Gotta go for the al pastor, best meat by far. Street tacos come with a guacamole spread, cilantro, onion and pineapple. Highly reccomend this place, my favorite Mexican spot by far."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with some friends and we got there during a rush. Although it may work when they are not busy, the ordering process was chaotic and very slow. This place was expensive for what we got and I found a hair in one of my tacos."}
{"text":"Food is really really good...I'm just not a fan of the standing in line at each station for what you want to eat for dinner. One line for Al Pastor, then in another line for other types of tacos, and then another line for corn and mole fries and then yet another line to pay and get your drinks."}
{"text":"Pretty darn great!! Al pastor tacos...awesome! And the street corn was perfect. I'm looking forward to trying more kinds of tacos. The salsa bar is great but the topping on the tacos is legit. No need for any extras"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, interesting and fun.  I took my family of 5 in there just after they had opened.  Everyone left with happy, full bellies.  And I still had enough money in my wallet for a movie.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My tummy is singing show tunes! Yummy!! Delicious vegetarian options! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Overcharged me for my daughters bean & cheese burrito, and was rude about it when I asked why the burrito was $8.20. Reluctantly gave me 4 dollars back, took my receipt and ridiculed my family and I from the kitchen while we ate, assuming we didn't understand Spanish. Not much of a yelper but thought sharing this was necessary. It's a shame because the food has always been good there."}
{"text":"In town on business and wanted a good ol taco. Nothing wrong with casino food but I've never had a good taco at one, so I decided to try this place out. The decor is nice and so are the people, The tacos were great! Definitely hit the spot. I had \"Al pastor\" and \"Buche\" both were delicious, I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go in the Las Vegas area and the best Mexican food around. We go here often and no matter if its the middle of the afternoon, the middle of dinner rush or late night the staff is always on point and service is quick. Their serving layout works well and splits up different food items into different lines, very efficient if you know what you want and don't need to stare at a menu for awhile. Not as efficient when people don't read the signs(asking too much in today's society, paying attention and all) and go to the correct stations. 

The meat and taco selection is great and the house beer is very tasty. I usually come in close to or after midnight on my lunch break and its nice they are open late, not as many places in this '24hr town' are open. Salsa bar is very, very good."}
{"text":"I kept hearing the radio commercial on 96.7 and although kinda annoying I decided to give it a try if I ever find myself in that area. I was having some work done to my car a block away and decided to walk there for lunch.


The Good:
Friendly staff, very clean and fast service. I had a carne asada burrito and decided to try the al pastor tacos. It is the best al pastor I've had so far here in Vegas. I love Pepe's Tacos and Los Tacos Companita which have excellent al pastor. Taco Y Taco's al pastor blows them out of the water! The salsa bar is clean and a great variety of salsas. The tables were clean and the staff is constantly cleaning up after messy people that leave there trays on the table. Unlike Roberto's or Pepe's where its usually messy and the tables are filthy and the salsa bars are usually disgusting! I was very impressed how well they keep the dinning area. Taco Y Taco has fresh ingredigents and ordering at the windows is easy. Everything is made in front of you and the protions are good sized. 


The Bad:
I would give it 5 stars but for a total experience they lose 2 stars for the fact that they have a huge swap cooler in the dining area. Its loud and if you're not sitting where the air is blowing on you it's very hot inside. I hate sweating while I'm trying to eat. Next time I'll get it to go and eat in the car with the AC on.

Homeless and shady people hanging around the doors begging for money and cigarettes. I really hate this. The manager needs to run these shady folks away, call Metro or whatever get rid of them. My biggest peeve of any place I go is vagrants begging. 

Overall, great food, fast and friendly service. The food is 5 stars, the experience and no AC would put my total experience at 3.5- 4 stars."}
{"text":"Reminded me of Tacos el Gordo from my hometown in San Diego but this place is even better because it has a full bar, a dj, and chic atmosphere...loved it!"}
{"text":"So good! Made fresh. You can build your own tacos, burritos, quesadillas.... and vegetarian options!!!"}
{"text":"I was left waiting in line for five minutes while the worker was cleaning his taco station, but then a Spanish speaker comes along and orders twelve tacos from the other line. Awesome, so then I was waiting for ten minutes just to order two tacos that ended up being half-assed because they ran out of salsa as well as the other toppings. I also ordered al pastor fries, which were super greasy. The meat looked burnt and tasted super dry. It definitely wasn't just cut off of the rotisserie. Uhhh, I felt like it was meant to be thrown away and not served to anyone. Finally, when I asked about Taco Tuesday, the cashier rudely dismissed me without answering my question. I was there during the correct hours but okay... Why promote your specials if you aren't going to honor them? In the future, I'll just make the drive to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican Tacos, they do it all. Including Elotes ;) super convenient location (Trop. And Pecos by B of A)  If you haven't tried, stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I really enjoy their food. My only issue is when ordering the food. 

From my understanding, you have three different lines for tacos and depending on what type of meat you want, you would stand in that line. If you want a burrito, bowl, corn, etc, there would be another line for that. Then, you'd take whatever it is you ordered and go to another line to pay. When it's packed, the lines can get confusing.

Nonetheless, it's tasty and affordable for my budget."}
{"text":"So, I was raised in east Las Vegas, and the original, quaint Tropicana location is different in style and space, but both locations serve the same, authentic tacoria-style menu items...So get your feet wet on South Eastern before heading to the big leagues down ELV.

Two ways to go when ordering: either plan your attack...choose in advance from the menus while you wait in line, otherwise fire-from-the-hip, waiting until you front the line then order en espanol. You'll see a generous mixture of gringos y nationales in line....20-something hipsters filled this location pin the Saturday night we ate there.

Choices a relatively simple: choose your meat (pork, carne, etc.) choose the style (taco, tostada, etc.) then be prepared for the fixings (cilantro, onion, salsa, guac....)

I can whole-heartedly recommend the pollo, carnitas, and barbacoa...everything is soft and luscious like a night out, south of the border. Here's a tip - I suggest eating in courses of one set of tacos at a time, together with one or more rounds of their draft beers! Braving the ordering line isn't such a big deal once you get the hang of it.

If you have a big appetite, our simply want a handful of food, try the custom burrito bar, which works like other popular QSR burrito joints.

All in all, Taco Y Taco is an extremely authentic gem along the S Eastern foodie corridor, and is also available in a less-hipster wrapper along E Tropicana , you choose!"}
{"text":"Great food! Many lines. Excellent meat. Rolled in at 1 am after six redbulls and crushed a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"soooo good the salsa is king!!!!!!!!!!! come eat here now! its so good that your tastebuds will take off and shoot into other galaxies of flavor you never imagine possible do not refuse this restuarant it is the best ever ever"}
{"text":"Hit the spot perfectly. Been craving tacos the further into the states we got, and these were awesome. Had a gran taco, guac pico de gallo sour cream and soy chorizo. It was fantastic to see vegetarian options offered, and though I typically don't go for soy meat substitutes, this one was authentically tastey. Would wholeheartedly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is a whole other issue! I called to place a pick up order, the lady that answered was so busy.. she would start taking my order then kept telling me to hold. I had to literally repeat my order 4x. (That's fine she got busy I understand) but when we arrived guess what? Of course I should have known. MY ORDER WASN'T EVEN READY NOR STARTED! AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF SHE WROTE MY WHOLE ORDER COMPLETELY WRONG! Then when asking for cucumbers because they were so out, she made it seem like it was the end of the world to get more. They never have lids for their unknown salsas, as if the salsa Nazi was going to take it all! Not pleased!"}
{"text":"Ordering was a little confusing at first but the food was great. Was just in town a few days and wanted something away from the strip. When ordering you have to stand in line (which move quickly) for each family of meats you are ordering from. Was so good we drove back the next day with friends. Tried seven or eight different tacos over the two days. Beef was good but particularly liked the various pork tacos. Salsa bar has good variety to augment the flavors but didn't really need it."}
{"text":"We go here probably once a week and get the burrito bowls. We used to enjoy chipotle but once you go to taco y taco you will never wanna go back! The have Great service and a fun atmosphere! The al pastor (marinated pork) is do die for! True authentic Mexican cooked meat!"}
{"text":"First impression...place looks very clean. Sadly customer service was not good.  Staff not to friendly. Stood there for a good 5 minutes before I was acknowledged with a \"oh you want tacos\". Really???  Not feeling by thuis time. We sat down to eat. The meat was not tasty at all. Lacking seasoning/flavor.  My poor husband found a hair in my husbands taco plate. My daughter got food poisoning from the Agua de Horchata. Will NEVER go back to that place. You want good food, good FRIENDLY service...Tacos Tijuana on Flamingo. They were closed, is why we ended up at this nasty place."}
{"text":"I really love this place! When i'm craving tacos this is my go to place!!!!  Love it!!!! 
I always order the same ones.... cabeza, lengua, chicharron, chorizo! I can eat 8!!"}
{"text":"May I recommend the Mula and Vampiro with Al pastor meat. You will not regret it. The horchata is on point. Thick and full of flavor.
The restaurant is very large and always has some fun music playing in the evening. 
If you are looking for some good, authentic, street style food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Heading to Sam Boyd stadium in need of some food. Read the reviews for this taco place and we were all so glad we are here. The food was yum! Nice clean, quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"Authentic place, welcoming. Great service. You can tell they take pride in their food.Respect."}
{"text":"best Mexican food I've ever had. All the meats are high quality and not drowning in a weird liquid like cheap pulled beef. Very friendly staff, coke products instead of Pepsi products. I also have never written a review before. This place is so good I feel obligated, I'm not getting a free taco for it anything."}
{"text":"Yes please may I have some more. Al pastor is the must eat meat!  Who needs chipotle when you have this place down the street?"}
{"text":"Pretty good al pastor tacos. Tacos could be bigger for the price, but still pretty good. The best part of this place though, aside from the tacos, is their unlimited refills on horchata!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly people serving excellent food..a breath of fresh air for east Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible the lady was filling the bar, n knocked the tray out my daughters hands and they charged us for all the tacos, they made my daughter upset.   Never again will I go ..."}
{"text":"As a Hispanic this place is way too overpriced for tacos al pastor. The carne asada is a tad bit too salty and the portion of the carne asada nachos were small and the cheese was limited. Wasn't too fond of this place at all."}
{"text":"So far I've only tried the tacos and house Margaritas. Both were excellent. The day bartender was super nice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We travel to Mexico a lot.  Just got back from the tip of Baja.  These tacos taste like Baja tacos.  Great stuff!  Very clean and staff is nice.  Went 2 nights in a row."}
{"text":"Great food in a cafeteria style atmosphere.  Friendly staff and a great value.  I always bring my out of town friends here for tacos and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this place such a low rating because the food is great, however, their service is terrible. After waiting nearly fifteen minutes for my food I stood patiently waiting to pay. A woman was standing at the register with her back to me, at one point she glanced at me so I assumed she was helping the people in front of me. Another employee seemed to be helping them more than her, so I kept waiting. After a few more minutes she turned around and said hey. I replied with a very irritated sounding hey, she rang me up with the attitude of me inconveniencing her. At this point I felt as though no one deserved a tip because of the wait, and her rudeness. So when I signed their copy of the receipt I drew a line through the tip area. When I handed it back to her she showed it to another employee, to which he replied \"pendejo\". Now I don't speak Spanish, but I know enough to know what that meant  when I looked at her she had a snotty smile on her face, so I took my food and walked away. I refuse to eat here again simply because of her attitude and the unnecessary insult. Expect great food, but don't expect service with a smile. You might even get an insult with your meal too."}
{"text":"The perfect taco taco!!
My new favorite taco spot. 
Try one and see how good it can be. 
So happy they are close to me."}
{"text":"Love their mulas. Cleaner and fresher tasting than Tacos El Gordo. They had a nice staff. A tad pricey but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place, authentic, yummy and good service. The staff is always so overly friendly, jokes and actually carries conversation with you. Sometimes they give you little samples if the meat. The aplastic is one if my favorites. My roommate and I go here often. We were so happy when they opened this second location as it's down the street from our house. Full bar as well with beers on tap! Great way to end a stressful day at work."}
{"text":"To begin with,
Ive been to taco Y taco 3 times. The last visit was by far the worst. To begin with the restaurants layout is marginal at best.  It's confusing and has multiple lines, which would be a cool concept if other people had the same understanding. We waited in line for probably 10 minutes because everyone was just as confused as I was. Finally, we squeeze our way through to the front of the burrito line, and we were met with the absolute worst customer service my small brain could imagine. Being a restaurant connoisseur, I knew I wanted Al Pastor which was the meat for my burrito. She asked what I want, and I had to repeat myself 4 times before she interrupted saying that there was no Al Pastor. I saw it? But that didn't discourage me. Being a Good Samaritan, I kept going without a complaint. When I sat down to eat, the food was dry and bland, and tasted low quality. Me and my squad will never return to here. We are utterly hungry and pitifully disappointed. Chipotle Is two miles down the street."}
{"text":"When my husband and I are super hungry we come to this place! It's so yummy!! I usually order about 4 tacos and an horchata drink. I took out a star because they don't serve deserts. I also want to say that the radio commercial for this place is so funny!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is bomb! A little pricey but worth it for the clean and nice environment. We always have a great time here"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, bursting with flavor with an urban vibe and DJ spinning hip beats!  This will be my go to spot when I visit Vegas, just 15 mins from the strip!  A must visit off the strip! We tried their lengua taco, Barbacoa taco and pastor Vampire!  Their horchata was the best we''ve ever had. Wish they had a place like this in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco
My wife and I just moved here 7 days ago and have eaten hear three times.  My wife was born and raised in Mexico and has only been in the U.S. for 14 years and it is also her favorite. Nice selection and prompt service."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. The dining area was dirty and a bit run down. Burritos should have been double wrapped for their size - impossible to eat without creating a mess. The ingredients seemed fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing customer service! The music was on point, too! Definitely a high recommendation for locals and travelers alike."}
{"text":"This place is located at the heart of Eastern so it's always packed. Food is mediocre. Ordering is very confusing and there was no staff to ask or usher the guests in. With the music too loud, you actually have to shout to the food preparers what you want to order. Pricing was not too bad, though."}
{"text":"Came here out of curiosity after continuously hearing their awful commercials on the radio and was very pleased!

Super tasty tacos.  Friendly staff.  Abundant options. Clean restaurant.

Came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm and the place was fairly packed.  I had 9 tacos because I wanted to try all the different meats having never been there (which turned out bad the next day if you know what I mean), but all of them were very delicious!  They have a salsa bar with many different types of salsas and toppings, also tried almost all of them and they were great.

The staff was very courteous and helpful with the menu.  The place was extremely clean from the taco bar itself to the restroom.

Overall very pleased and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great tacos especially al pastor! The pineapple pieces really give it a nice kick of flavor"}
{"text":"Authentic street style tacos served up in seconds, in a clean stylish atmosphere.  Monday is mariachi night.  There is also a salsa bar, with house fired and then pickled jalapeno peppers.    The salsa barn also has pinto beans, which are done to perfection slightly firm not mushy, a little creamy.   They have a daily happy hour.  You order at the counter but I prefer to sit at the bar which only has four seats.  The tequila choices are varied and ones you will not find elsewhere the bartender is extremely knowledgeable about the history and origins of the various offerings.  My date enjoyed the corn on the cob cooked Mexican style; it is fire roasted and spices added.  I had chicharon, lingua, and buche.   My favorite is the Buche delicious and tender.   There are several fresh house made salsas including some made with habanero peppers my date loves that flavor, me not so much.   The food is great but the real hidden gem I have found on two visits is the quality of the drinks, fresh squeezed lime juice, and a house made tomato juice concoction to mix in with beer.  They also make two versions of sangrita, one sweet one savory sip a little while doing tequilla shots!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos in Vegas? Seriously?  Didn't see that one coming. 

I meant to hit a cheesesteak place (which has closed down) and something looked appealing about this place.  
Grew up in L.A. and Arizona so have had TONS of tacos and this place has suddenly rocketed on to my top 5. 
The tacos are the way to go. Great tortillas, good fresh salsa bar and some of the best taco meat (asada, al pastor, pollo) that I've ever had. The Gran taco has extra \"stuff\" on it and worth trying. 

Next time I'm trying the Vampiros and a few other different meats. For a place just opened 7 months, this place has figured it out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on popularity and high reviews, and was craving some tacos.
From the exterior, this place looked like an upscale sit-down restaurant, so we were surprised to walk in and see the order-at-the-counter layout. The lines are definitely difficult to understand, but luckily one of the workers there explained it to us. There is no explanation of taco menu items, so that was also difficult to order. 
We had gone around 6:30pm and the place was pretty crowded. It was very noisy, and there was a loud mariachi band playing as well, which wasn't very conducive to dinnertime conversation.
The tacos were just alright-- it was pretty sloppy and the flavors weren't anything to rave about.
Guacamole was good. 
I would try it again, now knowing the vibe and ordering system, but I would go during a less busy time."}
{"text":"Delicious Pastor Tacos! Also Can't go wrong with the Lengua tacos! Five pastor tacos and two Lengua tacos for $17. Big and clean place, salsa bar has many options, everything is clean! Pastor was perfect but I felt the pineapple addition made it a little too sweet. Would come back and ask for no pineapples."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the el pastor and the guy behind the counter seemed upset, annoyed and had an attitude that I even asked. It was amazing el pastor but I will check out more places in the area as we just moved here. Taco Bell has better service."}
{"text":"This location is bigger and better than the one on Tropicana and WAY better than Tacos El Gordo.

Food: I typically just get the al pastor. They put little pieces of pineapple on every order of al pastor and it's a nice touch. Other places do it too, but I really enjoy the flavor here of the al pastor with the pineapple and their avocado salsa. The tacos are delicious, but I also enjoy getting the vampiro or mulas (I'd recommend the vampiro if you want something crunchy). As for the other meats, I've tried some of them (lengua, carne asada, cabeza) and they're good too but I really prefer the al pastor. 

Location: This place is really spacious and pretty clean. They even have an upstairs! Don't think I've actually ever gone upstairs though because there are usually seats available downstairs. And besides, I don't want to walk up the stairs.. I want to devour that al pastor ASAP! 

Service: It can be a little annoying having to go to the different windows to get different meats and sides, but once you know what you're doing, it's not too bad. The staff is friendly and help direct you to the correct window if you need help. I really enjoy the condiments and salsa bar too. Always getting a nice helping of the grilled onions and peppers and extra salsa =)"}
{"text":"Yass! Delish and affordable!  We're headed back to Las Vegas early next year and will be stopping here."}
{"text":"Really good food, service is great, will definitely make this a regular place to eat. It's in a very nice location as well."}
{"text":"After a long morning of endless walks during a tour, my friends and I needed a pick-me-up.  Because we were \"hangry\", we came here for lunch.  I ordered the alpastor burrito and I was NOT disappointed.  The meat was flavorful and the servers load up with whatever vegetables you want.  There was also a salsa bar up in the front so we hit that area up like there's no tomorrow.  I definitely recommend this place...especially if you have the bad case of the \"hangries\"."}
{"text":"I never been there but today for a first time an I found a huge stone in the beans what a shame.."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is legit!  

This is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas, hands down.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best!  I come here every Vegas trip.  Al Pastor tacos are amazing.  I have not had a chance to try any other meats yet because the Al Pastor is so amazing and I only come once, maybe twice a year.  Super fresh tortillas.  Salsas and salsa bar are great also.  Nothing else to say really."}
{"text":"Well to start off it's great to have a authentic mexican taco shop on this side of town. I went with the mexican street style corn and El pastor tacos, both were perfect, It's been open for a week and I think it's going to do very well !"}
{"text":"Mexican food isn't usually my go-to when I'm hungry, but I truly enjoyed my experience with Taco Y Taco. I kept hearing the ads on the radio so I thought I'd give it a try when I was in the area. The service was friendly, the food was delicious, and the ingredients were super fresh! This is probably the only place in town I'll go to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Friendly employees and clean environment. Food is amazing. If you haven't tried their corn, you're missing out! Best taco place in town with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing! The al pastor is unreal. Also their elote is sooooo good. Best tacos in town hands down."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try with a group of friends during our lunchbreak. When you first walk in, the atmosphere of this spot oozes \"chill\" with high backed plush seating areas, family style tables and plenty of TVs covering all your mindless staring needs. 
When you approach the ordering area, there's a false impression of cafeteria style service. You actually have to take a moment to read the boards indicating the 3 different lines. I went for a lengua/barbacoa/chicharron plate of tacos, each prepared in various styles. There's a great salsa bar offering 6-8 different styles and garnishes. Also, black and pinto beans are available hot at the bar area gratis. No worries about remembering to order a \"side\".
I topped off my taco trifecta with a side of the house guacamole which had the perfect blend of shallots, avocado, tomato, lime and cumin that my tongue looks for. Next I side - stepped to the bar to finish my meal with a Michelada which are sold for $5 all day with your choice of beer. I had to go with my Dos Equis. In all, a great place to get your taco fix with every style of meat available you can think of."}
{"text":"Man o man I'm as Mexican as it gets and I know about real Mexican food and let me say this tacos are fucking bomb I ordered 16 tacos I had al pastor,chorizo,lengua,cabeza,pibil,carnitas, asada and tripas and they were all Hella good I'm definitely coming back to this place every time I'm in Vegas and the vibe from the restaurant is very cool"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Got chicken, barbacoa, and carnitas tacos. Wife got nachos. Food was a 6/10.  Tacos are miniature and I can get the same off the taco truck. 
For someone that's never been there it's totally confusing. The trays are at the end of the line at the register and the start of the line is labeled as station 4 instead of 1. Then the signage isn't good enough for the new customer to figure out how the whole thing works. Once you know how it works it's easy. There's not really a line, it's more a free for all to get your food and then get to the register and wait. 
Like most other people said, the register area is totally inefficient and slow. 
Super grossed out by the salsa bar. The ladle is WAY too big for the mini cups they provide, so you end up pouring it all over your fingers and then it drips back into the salsa. Saw this happen with almost every person before me. Passed on the salsa after I saw this."}
{"text":"Great fresh made tacos. Hand made tortillas.  The nachos were also awesome.  Great fresh food all around. Great salsa. Only minus would be that it's a little on the higher side as far as price is concerned but worth it"}
{"text":"One of my top Taco shops in the 702. Highly recommended if you like street style tacos. I haven't had Al Pastor this good, since the last time I was in Cancun. Ordering is simple, just get in line for what ever you want. Food is so delicious."}
{"text":"Rude disrespectful staff, dirty salsa bar/eating area, & the food wasn't great either! 
3 people out of our party of 6 got food poisoning! 
We definitely will NOT be going back! Don't waste your time coming here! 
If you want amazing tacos, great customer service, & a clean restaurant.... just go to the original \"TACOS EL GORDO\" at 1724 E Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas NV, 89104. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is \"okay\". The spicy pork is not fabulous and a bit of a letdown. The fresh salsa and guacamole are pretty good. The room is cool. Overall it's just okay."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST and FRESHEST Mexican food in Las Vegas!  Everything is made to order in front of your face.  Pricier than other Mexican fast food, but WELL WORTH IT!  I tried a VAMPIRO for the first time and I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now.   At first I loved it.  And then service and food got worse each time.  And trying other taco places and comparing prices.  They are a little overpriced for the size of the taco.  Extremely small not much filling.  I do like the al pastor tacos still.  But i will be trying new places from now on.  So many out there to experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always get my taco fix here. Once my tacos were not as good as usual. Not sure why, I was embarrassed but I took them back and they made them fresh. Love it here!!! Best chips and free salsa on the bar."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but I was charged $1.35 for peppers on my bowl when your menu CLEARLY displays it includes peppers! & if you are making people pay extra then you should have it displayed!!!! & I didn't even get a lot, I would have rather gone to the store and buy a WHOLE pepper for that much! Such bullshit & your staff have a stuck up attitude when I questioned why I was charged extra for something so little! I used to come here all the time but I no longer will because of the poor service I was shown!! Unexceptionable!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. They have a great al pastor and asada, as well as all sorts of specialty cuts (lengua, cabeza, etc). Burritos are tasty too, and it's easy to order a simple plate if you don't want to try something new. Some of the salsas are HOT! Cute set up now that they have got things up and running (we came right after they opened and it was still a mishmash with the bar bistro that was there before). 

Lots of seating and a good selection of beers if you want to have one with your meal. Authentic and pretty reasonably priced. Taco tuesday is where it's at for a deal!"}
{"text":"Best street race experience north of the border! Think Gus' in Cabo in a super clean space!"}
{"text":"A little bit of authentic Mexico in a very upscale atmosphere...this concept is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've visited Vegas so many time and in my past few trips I decided that checking out more local places is a must.  I just happened to find this place by browsing Yelp and it lives up to it's rating.  A friend of mine who was also with me on this trip said this place reminded her of great taco places she visited in Mexico while visiting family.  We ordered all kinds of tacos from carne asada, pollo asado, lengua, chicharron, buche, and tripa.  They were all delicious and we ended going twice in our 4-night stay in Vegas.  The salsa bar had 6 different salsas but the habanero salsa wasn't that hot which was a bummer.  Nevertheless, this place is great and I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Unorganized.  Wait in a line for Al Pastor tacos then if you want carne asada another line. Same goes for quesadillas etc. No corn  (elote) it was gonna be 1 hour wait. No thanks. Place dirty, seating booths torn up. Loud music Spent 30 bux for 1 sope, 1 quesadilla, 3 tacos a beer and a soda. Poor customer service. For a walk up and not served at a table. WAY OVERPRICED.  Thank you it was an adventure won't be back.  Were still hungry portions are small. Go to Chipotles gosh it's not real Mexican food there but its filling and better service. Oh and I speak Spanish and I know My comida Mexicana y esto no es. Buenos Noches. Ahuevo!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent here and there is a decent selection of tacos. It can be a little pricey at $2.25 a taco. Food is based around the type of meat you are planning to get and can range from regular tacos to getting them topped on fries. 

The place itself is usually very clean and there is no doubt on the quality of the food and restaurant practices. However the ordering system they have in place gets hectic when the place is busy."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place. Vampiro style is what I get every time. A little confusing with ordering at first with 2 different lines."}
{"text":"I feel like taquerias establish their authenticity by the number of ordering stations present - the more areas available for you to complicate your order, the more legitimate the place apparently is (i.e. Taco Bell with one cash register does not cut it).  

I showed up around 8p with my friend Adam M. to check this place out after having a sampling of Taco Taco at the Yelp 89XXXhibition Block Party last month. I went in already knowing what I wanted to get - one taco each of asada, lengua, cabeza, and al pastor (hey now, don't judge - they are TINY tacos!). Seeing that asada requests were in one station, lengua and cabeza in the next, and al pastor in the last, I started by waiting in the first line for asada. A senora swooped in next to me, but I figured she was getting items from the other stations, so I didn't think too much of it. Then she started to talk - ohhh boy. 

\"QUIERO TRES TACOS DE LENGUA, CUATRO DE CABEZA, TRES DE ASADA, CUATRO DE AL PASTOR - NO, SABES QUE? CUATRO DE ASADA. Y QUE DIJE, TRES DE LENGUA? NECESITO SEIS.\" Okay, for those of you who are asking yourselves, WTF is going on, essentially she was ordering for the entire Chivas soccer team as well as half of the Latin Grammy Awards production staff, except for some reason I only saw 4 people at her table, herself included. But what the heck! I'M waiting for asada, why is there no respect for the station and its signage!? 

So ordering is a little hectic. But once you can get beyond that, the service is super friendly, and the food is fantastic!  The al pastor is decorated with pineapple bits on top of the hefty chunks of pork, while the asada, lengua, and cabeza tacos are all very well seasoned, and when ordered \"con todo,\" (\"with everything\") there is onion, cilantro, and salsas sprinkled on to enhance - not overpower - the meats. All of the tacos have very generous helpings of meats that, after being well salsa-ed, sit on the strongest little corn tortillas I have ever seen. Speaking of salsas, they have an awesome salsa bar as well - everything ranging from mild to habanero HOT, with chunky and smooth options too. 

They offer a free corn on the cob with any type of social media check-in (e.g. Facebook, Four Square, etc.) but they were out the night I went :( But they did offer me a free taco instead. I'm not an idiot to say no to a free taco, so OK! I'd definitely recommend bringing cash - it seems like their credit card machine is touch and go, so save yourself the hassle of having to go out to the Bank of America just to get more dinero."}
{"text":"Very nice place, overpriced for basic self serve mexican food. Be prepared to spend 15.00 and leave still hungry. Stations and set up is confusing. Food is very good but overpriced for what it is. Small portions."}
{"text":"Product is amazing best tacos in the city. The line was very unorganized especially the bowls and gran taco ordering spot. If they could organize that ordering area I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yelp has never steered me wrong and this time was NO exception! 
Had the bowl amazing very flavorful! I could not even eat the whole thing, dinner for later."}
{"text":"WHAT A ZOO!  This place does not have defined lines for customers to wait in, but rather a mess of a crowd to fight through to get to the counter to order your food. 

My first few times here, I just dealt with their lack of system because I like the food. The most recent time, however, I actually walked out never having ordered and pissed off because after being offered assistance by the employee to make my food, I step up to the counter and then he says \"hold on\" and just helps someone else instead.  Really? 

I won't be returning until they figure out how to create proper lines for customers to approach the counter.  Until then, it's just too stressful to fight within a mob of people to try to order food."}
{"text":"Incredible overall experience! I could not believe the quality of the food! I had the alpastor vampiro tacos! TO DIE FOR! I can not express that enough. Amazing flavor, amazing meats, clean facilities and very friendly staff! 5 stars just isn't enough for this authentic taco joint."}
{"text":"Great food, very fresh.
I had the vegetarian burrito,  I must say that if they advertise as having vegetarian options, staff needs to know what vegetarian is exactly.  You cannot have the Spanish rice as they use chicken broth to prepare it. And the black beans have pork in the broth.  So you really need to ask a lot of questions.  But once you figure it all out,  the food is great! 
I noticed prices have gone up as well.  Mole' fries were $7 now they are $10. And the burritos were $6, now they are $9. 
All in all I still love the service and side bar,  so I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Really good and authentic tasting food. I love their burritos, nachos and tacos. Plus, they've got a great salsa bar selection, tastes fresh and homemade along with many different choices. They've got a nice environment, great music, spacious dining area, and nice decor."}
{"text":"I actually drove here in the mood for cheesesteak, planning to try Geri's Old Philadelphia Restaurant after reading about it on Yelp.  When I arrived, however, Geri's was closed today for some reason.  I looked around and saw Taco y Taco.  A quick check on Yelp, and I was suddenly in the mood for al pastor!  Their style is similar to Chipotle - building your order to taste, but sooooo much better! The burrito al pastor is monstrous, and the al pastor was some of the tastiest I've had!  Their \"Mexican corn\" (elote) is a must try, as well.  To top it all off, they have bomb horchata, and one of the most generous salsa bars I've seen!  I'll definitely be adding this to my list of regular spots."}
{"text":"Great street tacos - Also the Mexican street corn is the best.  Good people, fast service, good environment.  Sometimes you have hustle to work your way through the crowd of people lined up for service but in the big picture I would rather the place be packed than it being empty!!!!"}
{"text":"First time in I noticed it was extremely hot near the order window, but hey the food smelt good! I tried the Soyrizo Burrito. It was a damn good burrito. The guacamole was on point, though the burrito was a little expensive in my opinion. Their meat portions are well worth it from what I saw. Ordering in English wont get you very far, but this is an authentic place, so I expected some language barriers. (I just pointed to everything). Not the classiest place, but worth it if you're looking for an authentic Mexican meal. Oh, and their salsa bar is awesome! Many additions to choose from! Totally worth a try."}
{"text":"Will definitely go back ^_^ The only reason its a 3 star instead of 4 star is how unorganized the restaurant was.

FOOD:
Al Pastor Taco (Station #4) - Delicious!  good pork favor and the toppings made it just right

Al Pastor Vampiro (Station #2) - Really good however i didnt even know what a Vampiro was.. there was no signs to describe it and no one could tell me what it was.  Vampiro is pretty much of a sandwich made of 2 hard corn tortilla, cheese, meat selection, onions, and salsa.   

Lengua Taco (Station #3) - meh, it was okay.  The tongue lacked favored and need to have that seared crispy to make it really good. 

SERVICE: 
The layout of the open kitchen, signs, and where the food trays are is kind of deceptive.  When you walk in it seems similar to Chipotle/Subway, where you start at one end and make your way down to the cashier. 

There are actually 5 lines (Nachos/Burrito line, Station #2 Line, Station #3 Line, Station #4 Line, and the Cashier ).  However the food trays are located only next to Station 4 which makes everyone form a huge line.  You stand in line for whichever type of food you want and than you go to the cashier to pay.  

The staff is polite and some are friendly the only problem is that no one explains what anything is... like a Vampiro vs. Mula vs. Tostada.  All the meats are listed and there are some you know off the bat just due to seeing it your whole life... but there are some i've never seen before.  When i ordered the Al Pastor Taco, the guy asked me if i wanted everything on it, I asked what is \"everything\" and he just looked at me.  I ended up just getting it so i dont hold up the line."}
{"text":"Its confusing when you first walk in.  Where are you suppose to go to order your food? Is each line for something specific like a taco vs a bowl? 

They don't have what kind of meat it is in English on the menu and the employees were busy so I ended up looking up each word on my phone. 

The food is tasty and meat is moist. 

Lack of organization, dirty tables and trash was wanting to come out of the trash container. Bartenders were pretty slow. Good margaritas, but the two bartenders I went to at separate times made different types of margaritas.  I didn't question/complain to them about it, it was just a margarita."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome great tacos and awesome service. I would eat here every day if i could. Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"Had carne asada vampiros and mulas... long story short, they were so good I ate them all before I could get a picture. The atmosphere is pretty easygoing and there's upstairs seating so it was a fun place to eat at!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm tacos. I love the corn and al pastor. Before taco y taco I didn't know what street corn or al pastor was. Get some culture and yummy food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken vampiro and the chicken nachos. Everything was super delicious.  The cilantro sauce is so yummy and I always make sure I put it on my food every time. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food.  Absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"Best taco spot in Las Vegas way better then tacos el gordo the carne asada tacos are perfect and if u get a chance try the suadero tacos really good and u can't go wrong with alpastor tacos yummy stuff"}
{"text":"Such a fun place!  We went here for the first time today and were pleasantly surprised.  The whole multiple line thing is sort of daunting but the bartender picked up on our confusion and invited us to sit at the bar and she explained everything and took our orders so we did not need to do the line.  

The food was fresh and delicious.  I had tacos - carnitas and barbacoa- both very tasty.  My husband had carne asada burrito which he said was very good and he really liked the grilled tortilla...nice touch.

The bartender (I forgot to ask her name...she was super nice and helpful) brought us a sample of the el pastor and oh my goodness I can't wait to go back and have that!"}
{"text":"Walked in to a confusing layout / order system, and rude staff. After the ordeal of ordering and waiting completely too long for a burrito bowl. I ate, the food was average, not note worthy at all. The kicker to this all is the average, overpriced, and long waited food made me sick. 

In short if you want good food, good health, and a nice experience DO NOT EAT AT TACO Y TACO!"}
{"text":"Good food decent prices always good food and decent pricesGood food decent prices always good food and decent pricesGood food decent prices always good food and decent pricesGood food decent prices always good food and decent prices"}
{"text":"Well we came back ...
Perfect o this time Cristofer the bartender awesome. ....li juego e always ..
Good food nice people this time"}
{"text":"My final update for this place. Weakness for tacos brought me here once again. Mistake....I could not eat the atrocity they called a steak casadilla. When I asked for a refund of the item, they would not. Asked for the manager, he swore the food was made right. Asked for the owner, no call back. What a hassle when they make a mistake. Eat here at your own risk. Thank you, manager Tony M!"}
{"text":"This place is bar none one of the classiest, most delicious Mexican food spots I've ever been to. Food is awesome and the atmosphere is high class without the expensive price tag. Jose makes the best house margaritas made with fresh lime and pineapple juice,  agave and tanteo jalapeño infused teguila. Best margi I've had in awhile. Definitely recommend you go. You will be a regular."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place so my friend Jen and I decided to stop in during Happy Hour and give it a try.

I've seen some people comment on the lines and ordering. Now, when we were there, it wasn't too crazy so ordering was easy, but I could see how if there were a lot of people it would get confusing and nuts. Luckily, we didn't experience that.

We took advantage of the happy hour menu and had the three carnitas tacos and the chicken nachos, both of which were only $5 each! What a great value.

Not only was the food fantastic and yummy, they also have a salsa bar with all kinds of goodies, like black and pinto beans and the really good creamy green sauce. Everything on the salsa bar is included if you buy food so you could literally eat your weight in beans if you wanted. I weigh a little too much for that, but either way, it's worth mentioning.

I added a soda and Jen had water...bringing our grand total to $13.50 for a really good and filling dinner for two!

Note that the Chicken Nachos came with all the good stuff, like Guac and Sour Cream and Pico! SOOOO GOOOOOOD!! Also, the carnitas taco have a little kick to them, but overall the flavor was pretty dang good!!

I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"After living in San Diego for 12 years, I thought I had the best Mexican food available north of the border. I was wrong. The Carne Asada Tacos at Taco y Taco are not only the best in Las Vegas, but better than any I remember in San Diego. Just 2 miles off the strip, and well worth the drive from San Diego."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. The food is sooooooo good. Nothing like it in Las Vegas. MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Bombdotcom! Tried other taco joints in Vegas but this is by far the best! Love the alpastor tacos! Quick, friendly service! Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Ordering process confusing, staff less than friendly(exception being the cashier), luke warm, and in my option a little on the pricy side. I had just watched what looked like amazing nachos being constructed for the guy in front of me in line so I expected the almost $9 burrito I was about to order would be stuffed with ingredients but instead I watched as thin layers of components were added. Burrito was not even served to me hot enough for the cheese to melt inside; left me wondering why they bother to wrap it in foil then serve it to you on a styrofoam plate. At the soda machine I was interjected by a fellow diner who told me there's better spots to try on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Decent food. Ordering process is a nightmare. Not worth the hype and cattle call to get lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I loved the food I had here (bowl with carne asada, veggies and other great things). I liked the dipping sauces/salsas that are available. As others have mentioned, the ordering process leaves a little to be desired for any rookie entering the establishment. It is confusing."}
{"text":"Im not sure that people in Las Vegas no the differance between mediocre Mexican and great authentic food. But Taco y taco is not good let alone great. The carne asada is the cheapest beef they could buy, the ordering process is really really bad, and not planned or thought out very well, the food was dry. The salsa bar was the highlight of the restaurant, but food is not that impressive at all i would pass on this place. I get the whole idea behind trying to give people authentic mexican food  in and upscale setting (Henderson) but this place fails to impress a Cali boy who knows the differance between real Mexican and not so great food. I would rather make the drive over to El Panzon over on Sunset and Sandhill, its a hole in the wall, but you will get great food, or just go to Los Tacos, its much better than this crap."}
{"text":"The only criticism that I have is their ordering system. Very confusing but WORTH the frustration! The food was amazing! The al pastor is the best that I have had! Loved it!  Go NOW!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Seriously, if you like tacos look no further. Taco y taco is just off the charts good.  Been to both in town and they are both great. This place is a little more trendy, the Tropicana one is a little more authentic. But both have great street tacos.

The el pastor is so good."}
{"text":"Meh...Food was OK.  Chipotle or Zabas is better.  Environment is great and the patio was delightful.  But, I really do not like the \"station\" set-up.  I was so confused, and, didn't find it easy to navigate, at least for their quality of food.  If the food was to die for I would expend the energy necessary to figure out which line to stand in, get my food and then go stand in a second line to pay the cashier.  I really don't like that there isn't waitstaff, especially for drinks!  To go up to the cashier each time is a waste of a good buzz.

Maybe great for some, but, not for me..."}
{"text":"A real find off the strip.  This is the place to go for authentic street tacos.  The carnitas were cooked to perfection and the corn on the cob is to die for!  Clean restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Honestly, I used to like eating there but my most recent experience was so bad. I understand that it may be hard to hear behind the counter, but I had to constantly ask the employee what kind of meat it was. Eventually, she gave up trying to listen & gave us the most horrid attitude. She was rude and she made the rest of our order carelessly, not to mention, she picked the meat for us just because she was too irritated to talk to us anymore. Then later when we went to go pay, she went ahead & talked about us in a very rude way, in spanish, & I know this because I do, in fact, understand spanish, but she seemed like she didn't know that. This employee was named Bessy (I believe that's the name I saw on the name tag). She was honestly just so rude & I'm not sure if we all want to come back here if this is how the employees are going to treat the customers. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ATTITUDE."}
{"text":"Great meat! Great Salsa! Great Chips! Great Guacamole! Great Location! that pretty much sums it up. I love going here during Happy Hour and sitting at the bar. The bartender actually will serve you which is pretty perfect!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot, however my last visit it was quite dissapointing. The tacos were not good. The chorizo meat had no taste. Couldn't even taster chorizo and it was cold.  The Adob(just okay and cold), asada (okay), and chicken(eeeh) they say they just hand made tortillas but they use them from a package? I do give it to them. The mulas were delicious !"}
{"text":"Never again...I like the food that why they got 1 star.  Service is horrible, especially to go order or if you are not Hispanic.  They seems irritated when you mention to go.  I waited along time for my food.  I asked for some larger to go sauce cup they said to use the tiny tiny sauce cup that they have by the sauce.  I noticed a hispanic lady came up and spoke to them in spanish and she was given the large sauce cup.  I then ask for the top, they handed me TWO. This place is slow (work at their pace), unfriendly, (if you not Hispanic),  and stingy."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended my husband and I visit Taco y Taco. We were hesitant at first, but decided to give it a try the same day. We really liked the food! My husband now raves about the tacos and is always craving them. Our favorite is the Al Pastor tacos, the Vampiros, and the Mexican street style corn is good too! 

Both times we visited, there was no wait, everyone was very friendly. It can be a little confusing at first, but everyone there is fast to explain the different stations. 

We both ate for under $20, can't complain. I recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Taco y Taco for a few months now. It's our go to place for tacos and burritos. The tacos al pastor ($3) are the most authentic I've had outside of Mexico. The burritos ($5.50) are large, filling and a great value. The salsa and veggie bar is a can't miss too. Love those roasted peppers and onions!"}
{"text":"I've been stalking this location since I got word that they were taking over the Republic Kitchen. My husband and I love the original Taco y Taco, we'd fight traffic once a week for their delicious al pastor, guacamole, chips and salsa. The newest location is only minutes from our home... which might be dangerous, but we're thrilled to welcome TyT to the neighborhood.

We went opening day just before the dinner rush. We got our usual order and a couple modelos. They'll soon have a large draft selection available too. I was a little concerned it wouldn't be as tasty as the original location, but I had no need to worry. Everything was delicious!!

The new space is modern, large and clean. They can accommodate large groups and big crowds. I do wonder if ordering will get congested during peak times, like how the original location bottle necks, but this one is more open so it might be ok. Whatever the case, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am in love!!! authentic tacos! yes I am a huge fan of tacos el gordo but this place has the nicest people working there. They are all fluent in English very friendly. The place if very clean and has a very rustic décor. The food is absolutely AMAZING!!! They have many options (even vegetarian) but yet very delicious."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of replacing a more distant eatery for my \"Breakfast Burrito\".  Feeling like this beautiful establishment \"should\" be able to produce a more robust and scrumptious burrito, especially as it costs over $5.  My usual more distant eatery charges just under $4. They didn't even have eggs @ 10:25 a.m. and offered me a free beverage for my inconvenience as if I was poor and needed a drink.  All the fixings are behind glass in front of the patron for choice as in a Chipotle but I had absolutely no options or input as to what ingredients went into my burrito.  I was flying blind and dependent on the talents of the cook who I discovered needs a lesson from my old establishment.  Also, everyone who works there is busy feeding their own mouths.  Waiting for the eggs to arrive, all I saw were people chewing and holding plates under their faces while in their workstations.  My guess is, this restaurant had been an upscale eatery that didn't work out and the taco owner moved in for a song just to keep up appearances for the mall it's located in. Being that he's worked hard to get this far, he's not there to manage his mice while they're playing.  My mistake for thinking a place called \"Taco y Taco\" could make a burrito.  Next time I'm not taking any shortcuts and going the distance."}
{"text":"This place over charged me for my food and promised it would get credited back within a few days, but never happened."}
{"text":"Walked in and deafened by the loud music.  Let's say ordering food was a challenge.  We arrived just minutes before the lunch time rush began.  A very confusing process when ordering food.  Everyone was guessing where to begin.  Finally got our food and then proceeded to the salsa bar.  Now with the lunch time crowd piling in, getting to the salsa bar was impossible.  I would reccomend relocating it far from the confussing food ordering lines.  It became a mixed jumble of confusion and frustration for everyone.

I ordered 3 tacos and she ordered a salad, along with a couple of beers.  Very tasty, and the salsas were great.  Had to practically shout to converse, because of the music being pumped over the sound system.  They do not skimp on the guac, compared to Cafe Rio, where you get a tiny teaspoon scoop of guac.  Finished with the meal and a cold Stella, while watching and laughing in amazement at the other customers trying to figure out the maze of lines.  Would eat here again, but would advise to avoid the lunch time rush.

Place was clean and friendly service.  Food was authentic and tasty, but giving it 3 stars for the mass of confusion while ordering, and the overpowering thump of loud music.  This in turn.... caused every person in the joint to yell, just to converse.."}
{"text":"Best Taco I had since I left LA 6 years go!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the music was awesome.   I love the live DJ!!  My kids loved it too and wanted to make sure we checked out the \"cool\" bathrooms and went upstairs.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love the food but the ordering process of having to go to potentially 4 different lines and then the cashier if you have a varied order but the food is great, the people friendly"}
{"text":"Ohh street tacos. So tiny and delicious. And that is definitely the case at this taco shop meets bar meets restaurant. 

I've been here a few times now and each time I have a new item that wins me over. To really put the staff to the test, I recently visited on National Taco Day ($1 tacos!?!). The staff seemed prepared for the rush and were their usual efficient and friendly selves.  The tacos are so tasty and even though to get a true variety you need to wait in a couple lines, the wait isn't too bad for any one item. The tacos al pastor are sweet with an addictive kick, my favorite by far. Ingredients taste fresh and if tacos aren't your thing you can pick the meat or veggie of your dreams and throw it in a burrito, quesadilla, on nachos...the possibilities are almost endless. 

Keep any eye out for specials not on the menu, usually on a tiny sign on the counter. Once advertised were the Mole Fries...my life will never be the same. Sweet potato fries, meat of your choice (get the chicken), mole sauce and cheese. I warned you....

They have a full bar but I usually can't resist the horchata. 4 stars only because I always find it to be HOT in there. I know there's good food cooking but crank up the AC a bit for us guests. So many cravings satisfied in one cozy venue, a must have."}
{"text":"We got carne asada and pork tacos, and chicken nachos. 

Tacos: bomb. 
Nachos: meh. 
Music: way too loud."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable atmosphere. Crew was very friendly. Ordering feels a little awkward at first, due to its cafeteria-like style. 

The food was good. I would personally recommend the Barbacoa and carne asada tacos. Take advantage of their happy hour, $4 michelada 

Anyways great place. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Two days in a row I have had bad experiences. I won't be back to this location ever, drive down to the one on Tropicana, it's worth it.


Ordered our food. Mine came. I waited to eat with him. Waited 15 minutes for a burrito (yes it was picky but he is allergic), my food was cold (no big deal). Lost the ticket. That's ok, it happens I get it. Wait another 7 or so. Comes wrong, specifically asked for cheese. Asked again, didn't get it. I had to go to the lady and get it myself.


They have turned this place into a turn and burn. I get it. But I won't be back. Two bad experiences in two days. Done.

It's also way too loud."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour or Tuesday tacos. The best part about this place is you can sample any meat to assist in your decision making process."}
{"text":"Living in Mexico City for almost all my life, finding a good taco place has been essential. Definitely the best ones I've tried during our time living in the States. Best tacos ever! And service was also great. To bad they don't have anything like this where we live. This place will be our first stop coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wasnt thrilled with different lines for different items. If you want seafood and a carnitas taco you'll be on two lines while the food you ordered on the first line gets cold. For the price the food is good. I had two little carnitas tacos which were I believe $2.25 each. The meat wasnt really seasoned. Next time I'll get one of the beef tacos. The nachos looked good, too. One gripe is there are lots of choices but no descriptions. Another gripe is one line stands along the salsa bar. So youre either in someone's way or someone's in your way. Four lines is an ok concept for speed but not when you might have to get on different lines for different items. Pretty crowded on a Friday at 7 but thats good and probably because the meat is quality. Also, unlike a lot of mexican places you dont get free tortilla chips at this one. Just sayin."}
{"text":"OK food and prices, the service is okay but the kitchen staff does not communicate well. They only offer one size drink and at 2.50 thats too much to ask, but they do have free beans at the salsa bar thingy. I'd go again. Also they had a great cinco de mayo special."}
{"text":"Service was A+++ Omar was a great bartender and very attentive. Place was very clean. Food selection was good, would have liked to see a few more options. The tacos that we had were tasty and the salsa selection was very good!!! See you guys again real soon!!!"}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is a good tasting restaurant. Food is seasoned nicely and always looks and tastes fresh. I recommend the burritos they are perfect size and taste great! Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"I love the food here....

The food is order through stations. Their Street Corn is mouth watering. Their nachos are the bomb. Their tacos are so diverse. Their bowls are great. Their quesadillas with steak are addicting. Anything I've eating here is worth coming back for. That's why this place gets five stars, their food is fabulous!

Soooooo what's the problem....

Their service sucks! I always feel like they serve the spanish speakers with better service and respect than those who speak English. Every single time! If I ask for extra cheese or no avacado or anything to peronalize my dish, all I get are eye rolls and they ignore my requests. If I want my order togo, they suddenly become extremely rude. They are stingy with their sauce caps, they don't want to give me a togo bag. 

Overall....

Love the food, hate the service. So if you can ignore the rude attitude and enjoy your food. This place is perfect."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Very clean and well maintained. Love the tacos. In my opinion this is what they do best. I strongly suggest hitting the tip jar when you place your order. Just a couple of bucks goes a long way and will make your meal that much better - for sure.

Only two drawbacks:

With the exception of the cashiers there can be language barriers behind the counter. When this happens you need to speak slowly, clearly and toss in whatever Spanish you might possess. Not a big deal, but it can pose a challenge.  

The salsa bar - amazing taste, but no idea of what I'm getting. Is it hot? Maybe mild? Perhaps super spicy? You just gotta dive in and find out! Seriously, management needs to label the salsa choices."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating here.  I ordered 3 tacos. Asada, chorizo, and al pastor. Bleh.

An hour later I am puking and have nasty foul diarrhea that lasted the entire night and well into the next day.

Never ever again will I eat here.  

I think I will call Health Dept or Food inspection.

NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tacos el Gordo has nothing on it. The tacos are juicy big and freshly made in front of you. They even have nopalitos that they also make fresh. I love the extensive salsa bar it has like six different salsas. It has grilled onions jalapeños and black beans and pinto beans.. Love this place!! Highly Recommend! Best tacos place in VEGAS!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what the big hype is. I've had better Mexican food- and their portion sizes are just ridiculously small for what you pay. Bowl was about $6 and filled barely half of the plate (w/ a tiny scoop of rice). The Mexican corn was basically corn sitting in lukewarm water, lathered w/ margarine and sprinkled w/ parm and chili powder on it. NOT worth it. 
The 2nd time I went for just tacos (Al pastor) and they were decent but definitely not worth the price of 2.25/taco. It's a taco stand disguised as a \"nice sit down restaurant\" which it isn't."}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the original Taco Y Taco location countless times since 4 years ago when I first moved to Henderson. It's been great every time, and I highly recommend getting the al pastor meat added to any dish you try. I also get the al pastor on my burrito and have it made the way I want to. The other meats are also decent, the carne asada, lengua, and chicken are okay, but al pastor is the meat to get.

Sometimes they have a live dj playing indoors so it can get loud, but they have upstairs and outdoor seating if you want to lower the noise. They have a salsa cart after you pay where you can get all the sauces you want added to your meal. It's always a great time coming to Taco Y Taco because I know I'll leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"The food is so good. I had the Al Pastor and chicken tacos and they were packed with with guacamole, sour cream and all the fixings. They were delicious. I also tried the carne asada quesadilla, no fatty pieces and it tasted great. My favorite thing about this place, however, is the salsa bar... I don't know what kind of salsas they were in particular but the light and dark green salsas were AMAZING. All the others were great too, it also has grilled and raw chopped onions, grilled peppers and black AND pinto beans. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Great customer service  love the al pastor tacos the best around. So scrumptious and you must try all their salsas simply amazing. Must have every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food tasted delicious! My friend told me about places that had different lines (line 1,line 2, etc) for different meats or preparation so I was a little familiar with the process.  It was a little loud when ordering, but after getting the food it was easier to hear and have a conversation.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas! All the food is soooo good and I'm picky being from So Cal. Ordering can be a bit confusing but I'm thrilled with the new location so we can stop driving to the ghetto even though we did it because there is just no comparison.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were starving after cheer competitions and found this little spot. Can I say !!!Amazing!!! We devoured our tacos so quick no pictures were taken  sorry but delicious they were! Trendy taco shop great atmosphere, ordering was a bit confusing in the beginning as they have four stations where ordering is different at each one Alpastor orders in station one, station two consisted of various beef and pork meets, station three Asada and chicken"}
{"text":"I was amazed to find an amazing taco joint disguised more as a hol-in-the-wall. They have so much space and they keep it so clean. My Spanish is not very good, but they certainly understood my Spanglish and my parents' English. I had to try each salsa they offered and I got the carne asada taco and al pastor taco. They convinced me to get the al pastor after giving me a plate to taste it. So yummy. They even had pineapples on the al pastor taco. Such a lovely surprise. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Finally a good taco place in Las Vegas, gordo is a tourist trap. Growing up in San Diego I hold mexican food to a championship standard and this is as close to San Diego mexican food as I can get without a plane flight. Gotta say taco y taco is the place to be. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Go to Roberto's for nachos....Taco y Taco nachos were no bueno. Chicken tacos were alright. 
One star for the soda and one star for the flan."}
{"text":"This should be the most popular taco spot in town! And if you didn't know- now you do! Get on this!"}
{"text":"Went to taco y taco for lunch and it was the best. So friendly, clean and a great menu. Will go back for taco Tuesday during happy hour."}
{"text":"The food is good. But the ordering process takes forever.  They have it broken down to 3 lines, so you have to stand in line for everything you order and then wait for them to make it. I asked the cashier if it's normally like this and what causes the hold up and she responded, I don't know. I was wondering why it took so long."}
{"text":"When Yelpers start flooding a place, there's a good chance you will not be disappointed. I thought I was trying a new, hidden establishment on Tropicana and Pecos.  It's new, but it is not a secret--Yelpers will find good food! 

ORGANIZATION: The best thing about Taco Taco is the organization and service. Unlike so many taco spots in town where you may wait around in confusing \"lines\" shouting out jumbled orders, there are large signs directing hungry customers.You simply look up and find the item you want to order and head to that (well marked) line. Easy.

SERVICE: Better even than the signage is the service. Every employee is helpful and warm. I've been back a few times and each time the employees have greeted me with a smile and a warm disposition. It's funny how a smile goes a long a way. From the folks making the tacos to the cashiers, there is a professionalism about this place that I enjoy and respect. You don't have to break into side conversations or endure any annoyance from put upon employees here. Someone has done some training here; the attention to service gives this place an advantage over many others in town.

FOOD: The food is solid. The taco meat is well seasoned.  I had some minor quibbles with texture and depth of flavor, but the food offerings that I tried (tacos and vampiros) were good. 

ALL IN ALL: This place is clean and well lit. They've got a great corner spot in a quiet neighborhood strip mall and I will definitely be back. The food is good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely delicious eats! Al Pastor tacos. .. a must!!! Everything is a must to try twice... wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"On our family vacation we stayed in Las Vegas for a night at the Cancun Resort and as we were yelping for Mexican food near by, we came across Taco y Taco. Based on the reviews and ratings we decided to give it a try. There was 15 people in our party and luckily there was enough room for all of us. As we were checking out the menu, the owner (I think) came out and told us if we wanted to try any meat to ask the staff, which was great from her part. The food was AMAZING and the staff as well. It was so good that we went two days in a row and let me say this is going to be the spot we go to every time we are in Las Vegas. Thank you Taco y Taco....two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Henderson. Try the alpastor (marinated pork) tacos. They are the best and make sure to get the Mexican corn. Fair warning on Mondays they have a live mariachi band and it's very loud! And their chips are a little over cooked. Still worth it though!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out. I just opened a new nail salon on pecos and russell, so it was very convenient seeing as its only down the street and on my way home. 

It's comparable to \"tacos el gordo\" if you've ever been there. Set up is like they do in mexico. Walk and up order, they assemble right in front of u. Food was good. I personally like their chicken and Carne Asada. Their adobada or alpastor (red pork meat on the stick. Can't remember what it's called) is on the salty side. They give Flower tortillas for your tacos but u have to ask. They're bomb. Trust me. :) they also serve beer."}
{"text":"I lile their food and the fact that you can see is great. The employees are nice, however, their system disorganized. Ididnt know how to order and i didnt see the menu until i payed...i"}
{"text":"It's nice to have Taco Y Taco on Eastern. The restaurant is so clean and the service is good. The food is very fresh and I liked the ingredients they use. However, the portion size of the tacos are so tiny for the price. I sometimes go to Roberto's, and the tacos are packed with meat and ingredients for about the same price. I also found Roberto's taco's tastier because of the seasoning they use on the meat. However, I still like Taco Y Taco because they're tacos are a bit different from typical tacos and are very fresh."}
{"text":"Problem mainly with places like this is the amount of meat in your orders!  Even requesting more veggies, they load up on rice and beans!"}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down! The chicken is absolutely killer. I also really like the set up for ordering, you're in and out."}
{"text":"Good food, I also agree with a few others the ordering processes is a bit confusion and people (customers) get rude and push and cut in front of you.  This is not the problem of the store so I do not hold that against them.  Over all the workers are friendly and do what they can do to ensure your order is correct."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much. Went for nachos but got a burrito instead and man it was so good. I'm a vegetarian so usually I don't have a ton of options at Mexican food places which is fine but this place is like heaven w three or four different choices. Everything was good. Salsa, burrito, drinks. A+ top notch place."}
{"text":"I made my account just to tell you how horrible the food is. It is no way deserving of 4 stars. Best thing I had during my meal was the coke from the fountain machine. Terrible carne asada and at $13 a meal you're better off eating anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. When I havent had it for awhile, its amazing! When I've had it too much, its a miss. I am a regular though and quite a creature of habit. I do love their chiccharones tacos, those are addicting. I'd skip their seafood tacos (the shrimp is rubbery and a little slimy and tastes like it was just defrosted). My other favorite here is their carnitas tacos, those are pretty amazing! The salsa bar could be a little better. When you order chips and salsa, make sure you ask for fresh ones.... they tend to be hours old and stale- best to ask for a new batch. Great atmosphere, customer service is pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was good but the employees were rude. They made some extremely rude comments about my wife and I not expecting us to understand what they were saying. When I connected the manager I was told I would hear back from them and never did. So no matter how good the food was we will not be returning or sending any business that way."}
{"text":"In the area for a meeting mid-day , need some nourishment, still a little miffed Geri's cheesesteak is closed but hey, let's give Taco y Taco another try.

This time it's taco fest - 2 al pastor, one carnitas and finally asada.  I believe all were $2 each.  Wow, much better this time around.  large portions, just the right amount of pineapple in the pastor taco, geez, I think I ate all 4 in about 3 minutes ( felt that way ) - actually looked around to see if anyone noticed my piggy ways  as I was scrubbing off my face ... good stuff !!

I figure I can't push it up to 5 stars given my last visit until I have similar outcomes as this visit.  Yes, I'll be back !

{"text":"Great food, short wait, and above average salsa bar. I highly recommend their El Pastor tacos,  best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The tacos are excellent!  From the carne asada, to carnitas, to the various organ meats, everything is very tasty.  The nachos are very good as well.  You can get the nachos for only $5 during the daily happy hour as well as some other very good deals.  The salsa bar has a lot of options.  The only drawback is ordering the tacos can get very hectic and disorganized when they are busy.  The wait can get lengthy as well.  Their ordering system involves walking up to the counter and ordering directly from the preparer.  It can be fun and adds to the atmosphere, but if there are just a couple people in front of you, the wait can become quite long.  If they can ever figure out how to move their line faster, I wold rate them five stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Try the El pastor tacos! They are small but worth every cent! Very authentic!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and have gotten a stomach ache both times. The food is not that great! Way better places in town."}
{"text":"Our new go to place for tacos!  I like the atmosphere. There's a second story seating area that overlooks the main dining area, kitchen, and bar. There's tacos are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Totally confusing from the decor, to the ordering \"system\", to the menu, to the location of utensils, napkins.....the flow of the place is ridiculous. Food was OK.  Guess I dont appreciate stale, flavorless tortilla chips, brown (old) guacamole and peasant cuts of meat. I'll take Roberto's over this joint any day."}
{"text":"-great atmosphere
-friendly, fast service
-delicious salsa bar"}
{"text":"I always get the burrito al pastor. It's really good and around $6. The sides are also very tasty (veggies, pickles, salsa, etc). I like this place a lot. I wish I could keep going. The tacos seem a bit pricey--haven't tried them since the burrito is so good. Make sure to ask for some grilled veggies in there too."}
{"text":"SO happy I came across this place. Place is clean, staff is friendly. Food is amazing. Street tacos & their Mexican style corn on the cob is everything. Everything I've had is so fresh & delicious. Salsa bar is better than any other place I've been to. Would recommend 10/10."}
{"text":"So happy here! Perfect Sundays after church we tried Taco Y Taco in Henderson, and we love the decor and ambiance! The food is super ricoooooo and I suggest trying the Nachos and Vampiro along side the tacos!! Oscar was very pleasant and the manager checked on us on arrival and while we were eating! Very happy with this gem~"}
{"text":"I love coming here after service on Sundays. So far I've had the nachos and al pastor tacos. We'll definitely be back, I want to try the vampiro. The salsas are all homemade too."}
{"text":"Really good fresh taco! A variety of different meats. Decently priced. But keep in mind they are smaller taco most likely will need to order a couple. However ordering system is wonky, don't understand it. Luckily went there with no crowd so wasn't an issue. But there are multiple lines to order different things then you go pay. I'll go back for more tacos tho!"}
{"text":"Came and had lunch today...Delicious! The el pastor burito was out of this world amazing and the corn on the cob was authentic and yummy. Staff was super warm and friendly. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawaii - nothing even close to this on the island. Super delicious! I'm typically not a huge fan of Mexican food... but this place I would totally come back for! All the meats are super tasty and the tortillas are homemade! Also got their Mexican style corn - Delish! Chips and Guacamole was addicting! Ending the meal with a horchata - perfect sweetness. Really wish we had this in Hawaii...."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos!!  Mexican street corn is bomb!!  My new Las Vegas favorite place for tacos.  Salsa bar nice selection.  Open late 7 days a week.  They also have lots of good Vege only options like soy chorizo tacos if u are into that..."}
{"text":"Great food , great service , reasonable prices ! Best tacos I've tried so far this side of the 215 ! Oh my goodness,  if you haven't been here,  you need to , I highly recommend it ! Get the al Pastor tacos Yum in your Tum for sure !"}
{"text":"the al pastor pork was very flavorful. they put pineapple too--very good.  I love their salsa stion. plenty of sauces selection. the salsa was tasty.
Al pastor taco was $2.50..kind of expensive for small taco.."}
{"text":"Chaotic Friday night crowd. Literally, I had to elbow myself through the crowd to get to the order window only to find out that the meat I wanted was served at another window. Whaaaaattt!!! Where are the signs and the orderly queues? The atmosphere was obviously too authentic for this gringo: I ended up leaving since having to wait in the correct queue for another 10 minutes was too much for my starving family."}
{"text":"Went in around noon today for the first time. The restaurant was not busy and after being properly informed of the confusing ordering system we were directed to the order counter. Unfortunately the employees behind the counter were more interested in talking amongst themselves than helping customers. After waiting for a few minutes we finally left and ate somewhere else. You only get one chance to make a first impression and they failed miserably! We will not return."}
{"text":"If they would have not had a DJ blasting music at noon on a Saturday I would have given 5 stars. Pretty close to the Al Pastor tacos at Gordo's without the long lines."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Taco y Taco. Michael, our bartender, is patient and knowledgeable, taking the time to answer all of our novice questions about mezcal. He even offered tastes of several before I finally settled on one. Amazing guest service! I will return..."}
{"text":"This place is hands-down the BEST Mexican food I've ever had in my life! For years, I thought my hometown, Chicago had a great pool of some fantastic Mexican food, but no- Taco y Taco is mind-blowing good. It will make you swoon with every bite no matter what you order. Everything is fresh, from scratch and made before your eyes. Oh please come to Chicago, Taco y Taco because you've redefined the definition of great Mexican food and I can't hold off til my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My timing was perfect as My girlfriend and I stopped  by on a Sunday afternoon. We came in at 6 right before happy hour was over. We walked in and noticed there were a few different sections to order from. We decided to sit in the bar and just order the way we're used to ordering . I had a taco de carne asada, lengua and al pastor. She ordered a mexican style street corn. The bartender Eddie was very friendly and made the stop even more enjoyable! Now on to the food! The tacos were very tasty as was the corn according to my gf. The tacos came with everything and they were filling! I also enjoyed the salsa bar which contained multiple salsas, breaks,carrots and peppers. This place is pretty far from me but I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to some friends word on the street got out fast about this new place, and I'm passing it on. It's delicious. 

On Mondays from 6-7 they have a live mariachi band. Even though I had to yell for my order to be heard, I loved listening to them. I want to go back next week almost for that alone. 

I asked for recommendations from Ray, the duke of the other location and I'm so glad I did. 

He recommended starting with the tacos (but try everything). Also he explained how it works. You start at station 1 (el Pasteur tacos) then work your way around to the cashier. Also, bring some ones to tip these guys.
 
The food: amazing
Highly recommend the corn on the cob. So good, covered in butter and cheese. 5/5

I got the shrimp burrito. The grilled up the shrimp fresh, added whatever I wanted on the inside and grilled it. It was good but I thought some of their other food was better (read: get the tacos) 4/5 

Tacos 
3 el pasture delicious! Get it! 5/5

2 carnitas so tender and delicious (my fav) 5/5

3 carne asada good 4/5

My mother-in-law got the carnitas burrito bowl. Didn't try it but it looked good!

To drink: 
Happy hour Coronas 3 dollars!"}
{"text":"Great prices and ambiance. I really lined the tacos. Lots of selection and great service."}
{"text":"This place knows how to do tacos and nachos. Though it may be intimidating ordering food from this place (especially when it is super busy), it is all part of the experience. 

When first arriving, you have a choice of which line you want to join, according to the type of meat you want. Al Pastor is their most popular, but they have your regulars from Carne Asada, Pollo, Lengua, and more. My personal favorites are the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada. 

For the Al Pastor, I like it in tacos and the Mula with everything on it, which includes pineapple chunks, onions, and cilantro. The pork is slightly sweet and is tender, and the pineapple gives it an extra dimension of flavor and sweetness. The onions gave an extra crunch and helped offset the sweetness of the pork and pineapple. But for those who are wondering what Mula is, this is like a taco but instead of just using tortillas, they use tortillas that have cheese melted on them. If you have no idea what I am talking about, trust me and just try an Al Pastor Mula.

In addition, the Carne Asada tacos and nachos are amazing. The Carne Asada is tender and lightly seasoned so the natural flavors of the beef comes out. They were topped with a house made guacamole, which had slight chunks of avocado while still being smooth, cilantro, and chopped onions. The nachos were also very good, where it used a combination of shredded cheeses, cilantro, guacamole, and sour cream.

This is one of my favorite taco places, do yourself a favor and try it out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Feel like your really eating very good food from Mexico.  But a Bit challenging if your not familiar with the ordering process how to order.  So here is an easy way.  Look at the board ... there are three lines though they are not specifically shown to newbies as a line they are. So you order the food listed on that board for each line in each line.  So if someone jack rabbits in front of you don't be alarmed they may not be familiar with the process and start with line one and slide down cutting in front of line 2 and 3 accidentally thinking line moves from right to left not an individual line for each number.  Grab your patience with them and coach them like a pro.  You will find the ordeal of ordering worth it.  And If like me the first time there it didn't have descriptions on the board just the item name.  So if you want to know what your ordering as menu not at the individual lives go to cashier and they are right there where you order your beer or margarita. Great deal on happy hour for that too.  Or you could do the ordering the vary easiest way and order at the bar which is full service.  All the staff you meet there are wonderful and Monday night mariachi live music great.  Two thumbs because I don't have three :).  Great food, great price, great staff!"}
{"text":"Great food everything taste fresh and really good...a little confusing for someone new but figured it out"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in town! Absolutely love this place. Service is always good and food is always delicous."}
{"text":"Loved their tacos!!! 4 stars and not 5 because its a little confusing on where to order from and where you pay."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. We had the al pastor tacos, a chicken quesadilla, and a vampiro taco with horchata and elotes. Everything was delicious. Highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and both times have been amazing! You can't ever go wrong with the al pastor pork tacos, but their carne asada is fire also. Great smoky flavor to it! We ordered nachos both with carne asada and pork al pastor and they're sooo good with lots of like and avocado dip on top. 

The atmosphere in here is pretty spunky and not too loud either. Makes for a great experience."}
{"text":"I had been waiting so long to finally try out this restaurant. So when my mom said let's go, you know I was already waiting in the car. 
Walking in the place was very clean and the atmosphere was very chill. We were greeted right away and asked if we had ever been there before. The staff is very helpful and informative and even offered samples of any meat we wanted to try. I ordered the nachos with al pastor. WOW for a small it still came with a lot on it. The chips were nice and crispy and on top it came with shredded cheese, your choice or black/pinto beans and meat, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado cream and guacamole. It was delicious!!! I was very pleased and the salsa selection was great!!! I was not at all disappointed and I highly recommend it. I will definitely become a regular here!!"}
{"text":"King ...... Que??? And tacos el gordo que???? Those places have nothing on TACO Y TACO!!! This place is taco licking good!!! Amazed on how delicious these tacos are and i am not even big on tacos but I think I am hooked! Been back 2xs in 1 week!!!! Must try everyone!!! And see the bartender named Eric cool peps and easy going! Fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"I don't think my family and I will be going back here anytime soon. It was really expensive and the food was not that great. I got the tacos with black beans and the beans were definitely not cooked. The guacamole wasn't very tasty, really bland. Also, if you are trying to order for more than just you, total chaos! And everything extra, cost extra. The salsas were really spicy though, so that's awesome."}
{"text":"Imagine the best food truck tacos you have ever had and you get Taco Y Taco. I am a frequent customer. It can get busy so I try to go on the off times a little bit. There is another location on Trop, but I like this location a lot more.

They have a wide variety of meats for you tacos along with other dishes like mole nachos and Mexican corn. Tacos are $2-$3 each but they have a happy hour. There is also a bar and occasionally a DJ. 

Probably the best praise I can give is that I make sure to bring all my out of town guests here as part of their Las Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Food excellent.

I am picky about them not cleaning the surface or changing gloves. I am very sensitive to Pig products and the guy never changed his glove nor did he clean the surface 


Also, the cashier over charged me and when refunding she didn't return the taxes on the amount charged.

I think the cashier was dealing with personal issues though. She was very distracted.

She gave my co-worker two drink cups, when he pointed out she gave him two, she handed him a third.....he was only buying for himself...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taqueria! It has authentic Mexican tacos, vampiros, mulas, sopes, burritos, Mexican corn, & more! It's all delicious, I esp love the suadero mulas & al pastor tacos... And of course the corn! Their salsa bar is seriously impressive--from mild and tame to fiery hot. Their bar service is also great. The bartender always treats us right and has the best beer list I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant. They also have a legit cocktail menu. Everyone is always so nice here too--if you can't pronounce something because of your inherent whiteness (like me), they're super nice and nonjudgmental. They're just happy you're there to eat their delicious food. And delicious it is!"}
{"text":"1st timer! Has 3 separate lines for tacos depending on what kind of meat you want.

I love how quick it is and the atmosphere is nice, cool, and modern.

I got the corn, and three tacos and a beer - everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok you won't be disappointed if you check this place out. Best tacos I've had in my life and I eat A LOT of tacos. Cool atmosphere has an upstairs eating area. I am thinking I'll be here a lot since I love around the corner. OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"Central California born and raised & I love this place - authentic, clean, &. Pure eating! The margaritas are excellent as well! Get a vampiro- skip the chicharrones. & eat eat eat."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place. She said  its not that fake Mexican food. Talk about authentic and Oh so yummy!!! It's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Street style tacos,  al pastor,  chorizo,  lengua,  buche,  pollo,  nopal,  cesos, tripa,  all delicious minus the gawking men.  It's very female friendly.  I mean,  I love the flavors of tacos El gordo,  but I don't like the ambiance,  it's the  ghetto side of town,  the loud obnoxious music playing in the background,  and I don't like being starred at by men with mouths open and gawking eyes. 

Taco y taco is fun,  with a small bar,  where you can order mixed tequila Drinks, and beer. There is an upstairs area for larger parties or special occasions.  I would definitely come back and get my taco fix."}
{"text":"Consistently good food.
Good vegetarian options!

The soy chorizo is tasty if you're looking for a meat substitute. 

Personally, I think that the burrito with napoles is a more interesting choice. They Aren't out of a jar, like so many places. It's a slightly lighter and less oily option.

Of course, I then pack on the guacamole and cheese - but you could make it more healthy if you like.

At the condiments bar, I grab some pickled jalapeños,  limes, and a couple of different salsas.  

A side of cerveza, and I'm a happy guy.
Good food - lots of it - for not much dough.

A great choice!"}
{"text":"This place just slayed my whole life. Unique, fun and delicious. So happy my friend thought we should go and try it! Best tacos I've ever had and I got a happy hour margarita. So I'm just smitten. The ordering process can be a bit confusing if it's your first time but the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely happy to have us. I loved it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Are you looking for something out the realm of Roberto's? Something way more authentic & tasty than Lindo Michocan? Here's your spot! Delicious meats, salsa's, full bar, upstairs private seating, music."}
{"text":"The tacos de lengua and tripas were very good, however,  the tacos de cabeza and carnitas were very fatty,  it felt more like mush than meat. Laid back atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Environment: Clean, fun, and lively. Sometimes they have DJ's. Perfect for a quick dinner date with friends.

Food: Lots of options, fresh, well seasoned, and affordable.

Also there are free beans in the salsa bar. Whattttt?!"}
{"text":"I love this place! TJ style tacos, the place is clean and friendly, they have a DJ on the weekends. Al Pastor tacos are the best! The Taco y Taco beer was very tasty, glad I found this spot in Henderson no longer have to drive to Tacos el Gordo which is also deelish."}
{"text":"These tacos are the best street tacos I have ever had! Certainly the best I have had in Vegas! Every choice is fantastic and their condiment section is large. Beer is a buck too! Love this place and mom and pop gems like this!"}
{"text":"Tacos have great flavor, hand made tortillas and fresh salsas...I'm in! Had a Vampiro, mulita and a taco. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely come back and recommend the place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and had to come try the Al Pastor tacos. They did not disappoint and I had 2 along with a carnitas and carne asada taco. They were some of the best tacos I've ever had. They were on the smaller size and I brought an appetite so after having 4 and a Mexican corn on the cob I was full. The staff was so nice I just had to give a positive review. So the Al Pastor  taco and Mexican corn is a must try on your first visit."}
{"text":"I love the feel in here when there is a DJ! The bar is great and makes a great drink and a michelada! Great salsa and meats but the rice is a little dry like Americans do it haha so if ur an original Mexican who like grammas wet moist n mushy type of rice, this isn't it but it is good. It's a great place and wayyyyy better than the bland food you get at chipotle. Try their salad bowl if your a health freak! My favorite thing is the ambiance."}
{"text":"I think I'm with fellow yelper Suzy H....the \"lines\" are a bit confusing and irritating. We stood in 3 different lines just to get a couple tacos, mole fries and a quesadilla. Not to mention the line to pay in. Oh, then the salsa bar line. Ugh. 

I couldn't find the napkins either and that irritated me. We sat upstairs and waited 30 full minutes for them to get our mole fries to us. I am positive they forgot after 2 reminders even. I watched two guys get theirs with no problem. They consisted of sweet potato fries with a mole sauce, chicken, and cojita cheese. This was worth the 3 stars. The tacos were soaked in a weird sauce and the quesadilla was so plain I wanted to take it back. 

The decor was cute and hip. There is a full bar. They have \"patio\" seating but I can pass on that. It's 3 tables on the side of the building. 

I'm pretty sure we won't be back. Nothing impressed me there and it's not close to home anyway. :)"}
{"text":"This is an authentic taco shop real taquisa tacos , original mexican food i loved it finally idont have to drive across town to get some good tacos .I like faustos and chipotle but its not the same its not authentic so if that what you are craving this will  different experience for you . Over all great food employes are friendly big space down and up stairs music was a bit loud but didnt ruin my experience ."}
{"text":"Long time fan of this place until today. Got to go food and then decided to stay to eat inside the restaurant. Upon opening my carne asada tacos I find out they are ICE COLD, as if the meat was in the fridge. 

My wife politely brought this information up to the cashier. The cashier than said \" didn't you get these to go?\" 

My wife said \"yes but they are cold. We would like them to be warm\" neither of us realized that to go food was supposed to be served at a cold temp. Who knew? 

Then the woman came out from the back and said you ordered these to go over 10 minutes ago (it was 5 minutes max) and said there was nothing she could do about fixing the problem. 

So for the 3 $2.25 street tacos, they now lost us as customers. I am happy to also tell everyone about the shitty service and cashier that was working today 6/12/17 at 1pm.

If management or the owner of taco y taco reads this, I hope you get a better service staff or you will continue to lose customers for cold meat and a horrible staff."}
{"text":"Tripas (ask for deep fried) tastes like the best bacon you've ever eaten. Meaty, crispy morsels on a taco is the best thing on the menu. Pibil and carnitas are pretty much marinated pork shoulder, so it's very tender and flavorful and looks similar to brisket. I found the soyriza to be too salty, the al pastor is pretty tasty because of the sauces, and the street corn is great, but the standout for me will always be the tripas!"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. Major points for having Mexican corn on the cob, it was delicious! I've never found a place with that on the menu. Everything was tasty, the pineapple on the al pastor taco was a tasty touch. I would eat here again, no problem."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS!
One star is not low enough!
We were IGNORED by the entire staff at Taco y Taco.
Worst of all, the TACO's SUCKED.
If you like tacos, avoid this place at costs.
You'd be better off just finding a Taco Truck!
Cold Carne Asada, dry Carnitas.
Everything we had (8 Tacos) were horrible...
And for $25????????????????????????
No Gracia.

Yelp removed my original review, saying I was \"culturally insensitive\" to this business. I guess white people are supposed to patronize a business and be ignored by the entire staff, who were all of the same race, and not notice. 
Thanks YELP, for the PC BS you dish out.
That's Caca."}
{"text":"Food is good but overpriced. I've been here on two occasions, first time got a gran taco & corn on the cob which was good, 2nd time I got nachos which were just okay, they skimped on all the stuff for what they cost. They have a variety of salsas and beans you can get from the salsa bar also."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best tacos and great price. We visit here every time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ya know I thought the food was really decent. They have a good enough menu and the have napales which is a great option. Anyway... making our orders vegan we got a bowl and a burrito... and added avo. I got mine On top of my bowl and my someone got hers \"on the side\" as she didn't want it inside her burrito. Now, this very easy request to leave one ingredient off the veggie burrito on the side... this jacked the price up to 2.75 or something completely out of line. My added portion of avo however was only like 1.35 or something... still overpriced. We were in a rush and scarfed down the food, it was good. Like a better quality chipotle if you will. I digress... I just spent how much on some mashed avo!? So apparently because you've inconvenienced them to put the avo on the side it's triple the price. Or no no wait... it's cause the styrofoam foam waste product you put the avo in cost that much? You seriously could have slapped that spoon of avo on the side of the plate NEXT to the burrito and called it good. Nope. None of the reasons. It's a, \"just cause\" scenario and that will be the answer, and it will be given with a smile. I don't know if I would go again simply cause it's rice and beans and Panchos is across the street. So in short... food isn't that special, I could make it.. and therefore I'm not impressed.  But it's worth a try and it might just be the best thing at that moment. Just don't get anything on the side as there seems to be a hefty tax... which would have at least been their tip. Oh well. I hear they have 3 for 5 Avo at sprouts haha!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I was hoping for awesome Mexican food. The service is fast and the employees nice enough but the food isn't that good and is a little expensive for what it is. I'm sure Vegas has some good Mexican food somewhere but it's not here."}
{"text":"Fist timer havent bit into my carne asada burrito but the cook provided me with a little carne.to nibble on while my meal was being prepared must say it was tasty"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with some girlfriends and loved it.  I am a huge fan of El Pastor tacos!  I usually drive all the way to the other side of town for tacos el gordo.  I'm so happy this place is like 10 min from my house and is so much better!  They have more food variety - You can make bowls, burritos, street corn.... They have a huge full bar - the horchata rum drink and their house margarita were very tasty!  Their interior is super clean and chic decor.  This is not a little taco shop. Weekend evenings they have a DJ Upfront which we enjoyed while having our delicious drinks and chatting up over some tacos!  Great little spots I will be bringing all my clients for lunch"}
{"text":"Maybe it is not fair to throw up five stars over two tacos, but as the saying goes, \"All's fair in love and tacos.\" I had the al pastor (spicy pork) and buche (pig gut), and both were phenomenal. Taco Taco is a (brace yourself) taqueria. Sure, there are some other options (i.e. burritos, bowls), but tacos are at the crux of this business, and business is good. As per taqueria etiquette, you walk up to counter and order directly from the cooks. Feel free to try the various meats they offer (the cook I dealt with gave me a try of the al pastor unprompted) before making your decision. After grabbing your grub, Taco Taco has a large, clean, and no-frills dining area. My only knock is that there are not more tacos in the name. I would like to see them add a few and go with Taco Taco Taco Taco Taco in the future."}
{"text":"Great tacos but you might end up eating them cold! Their ordering system isn't very efficient. You can't order everything you want in one place, you have to go to different \"stations\" to order different items. Hence, by the time you get your quesadilla, your tacos are cold. God forbid you want something from yet a third station! 
Additionally, they don't have translations for what each of the meats are, only whether they are pork or beef. Careful, you could end up ordering beef brain and not even know it!
Yummy food, lousy set up."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Las Vegas for a casual bite or take out for vegetarian tacos. You will need need to get the attention of someone behind the counter to place your order. For me this has always been easy right next to the sign describing the vegetarian offerings. The salsa bar has pinto and black beans so you can load up your plate. I also visit the location on Pecos and Trop. Different atmosphere -- same good stuff!"}
{"text":"It's amazing the quaint little sports you find when you're out of town,  Looking for something different while we were in Vegas and came across this spot.  My husband loves Mexican food so we gave it a try.
While in line the gentleman in front of me said whatever you do you have to try the Pastor tacos.  So I tried them.  They were very delicious..  My husband and I both got burritos as well.  The food was seasoned well and the salsa bar was great.  (My husbands favorite thing)  The service was great and fast,  Everyone was super friendly. 
We ate upstairs and the ambience was nice.  I love that on this trip to Vegas we found so many cool spots to visit when we come back in September."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great locations. Very clean. They have an upstairs seating area as well. Local beer on tap. I recommend it to anyone in town!"}
{"text":"The food was great!! You form a line depending what meat you want. But the place was not clean at all. All the tables,floors and where you get the salsas and napkins was dirty!! They need to work on having the whole place more clean."}
{"text":"Yummy times infinity!! Love the tacos de lengua, their super soft and not overly salty. The Jamaica is tasty and fresh, I went on a Sunday when they were offering buy two get one taco free (I think it was only that night). I'm excited to try other stuff too, but so far hands down on the tacos de lengua, tacos de al pastor, and the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because of the radio.first time was great chicken  was made really good and moisty.and the steak was amazing between med to well.
I came today again to eat here and toke my friend with me-total disaster!!!!
Chicken was dry like hell I had to spit it out of my mouth 2 times for each taco(I order 3 of them) .the steak was very chewy !! 
That's all I done with this place !"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch alone prior to an appointment near by in green valley. This isn't the first time I had ate at taco y taco as the previous time we had someone run to the restaurant to pick up order and bring back to the hospital in Henderson so it wasn't exactly at its \"freshest\". 

This time I had came during lunch time on a Tuesday. To my surprise there was NO lines, and the guy was waiting for me before I even walked half-way through the restaurant. I'm a fan of eating lengua (beef tongue), buche (pig stomach) with possibly a choice between al pastor or carne asada. After I quickly received my tacos with everything, decided to try out their Elote (Mexican style street corn) as many have raved on how good it was. 

After paying and getting some sauces (medium and hot - habanero and green tomatillo) with some sliced radishes and limes, sat down and ate. 

None of the sauces were spicy, to my surprise. Even the so called habanero one wasn't all that spicy. The meats were flavored pretty well tho a little over tender for the buche and lengua. 

The elote was overly soft. I expected fresher cooked corn? Kind of reminds me of those ud get at fast food joints or buffets where its overly soft. Would have preferred more cheese and spice. Maybe I should try making this at home... HEHEHE"}
{"text":"Now that Tacos El Gordo closed down on the strip, I guess I will start coming here. Prices are pretty expensive for tacos. They serve the same things that El Gordos served. As long as they have lengua tacos, I'm happy. But for $2 and some change... that's quite expensive. They also have beer on tap here."}
{"text":"I found this place on unlokt and had to immediately drive out to try it!  I wrote in a recent review how I have been searching for a good Mexican place for a long time and can't seem to find one!  Well...the search is over!!!  I have now found one! 

When we arrived everyone greeted us and welcomed us. It made me chuckle to be enthusiastically welcomed to a Mexican spot...that usually only happens at Japanese restaurants, and even then sometimes they sound like they could care less that I just walked in. Lol. 

I told them it was my first time and the guy smiled and cracked a joke and winked at me. I didn't really understand it so I just laughed anyway lol.  He offered me a sample of this amazing pork they had, and so I tried it.  It was so good!!!!  I told him I wanted a burrito with that pork, and so he started making the pork....then he told me to try this amazing beef that they have and it was even MORE amazing!!!  I changed my mind and  told him to not give me any other samples or I'll keep changing my mind!  :) It was a fun ordering experience for sure.  

In my burrito I got lettuce, beans, a little bit of sour cream and lots of pico.  It was delicious!  I loved it.  Their salsa bar has a ton of salsas, the only thing I wish is that it had some type of description on their salsa bar so I knew what I was getting.  

The food was delicious, the service was awesome, and it is definitely my favorite mexican place right now!  I just wish I could go more often, but it's on the opposite side of town so it's a bit of a drive for me.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan....but they have become a PITA.  From the HUGE rips in their booth to the overcharging for guacamole on their tacos, to the 2oz cups they give you for water, to the attitude they give you for wanting fresh, not overcooked, sitting around meat...they are no longer a viable eatery for me in Henderson.  Go get customers that don't care, I'm sure there are a lot of them."}
{"text":"More than a taco joint. This place is special!  Nice layout & decor. You'd never know that from the outside!  They've got some fabulous favorites like Tacos Al Pastor, carne asada, chorizo and chicken with a curious assortment of the more authentic Mexican meats like tripas and lengua.  It would make your Mexican Nana proud!"}
{"text":"We are from upstate NY so we don't have anything like taco y taco. It was a bit confusing at first on how to order and pay but once we figured it out, it was a smooth process. We went to Taco Y Taco three times in a span of 1 week. This place is that good. The prices are much better than taco El Gordo and also less crazy (compared to the location on the strip). The Al pastor fries and Al pastor tacos are perfect. My wife loved her chicken taco and the chips/salsa. The food is so affordable but great quality, I am already looking forward to the next time I'm Vegas just so I can stop in and eat at Taco Y Taco."}
{"text":"One of the beat tacos in all of Las Vegas. I love this place it's clean and a great sit-down taco joint."}
{"text":"This is def. a Family favorite for us. being from L.A we are a bit biased when it comes to eating tacos. But if your seeking good food, and good customer service? This is it. Prices are a bit high but it's worth the trip. Street tacos al pastor are great !"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place so I was quite sure that I am going to love it! Finally went yesterday and I was not too impressed. This could be just me, but upon entering the place, I felt the heighten chaos and super loud music as an assault to my senses. We stood there confused for some time wondering how to order and where to go. We noticed a bunch of people with something like a line so we went and stood there... thankfully someone came to us and asked us if we knew about the ordering process. She explained how it works - you go in the line that you want something from (line 1, 2, or 3). But the problem is, for someone who does not know a lot of spanish terms, half of the items would not make sense unless they google it or ask what it means. I did not feel very comfortable asking about each and every item in such a chaotic rushed environment. I would have appreciated some kind of a hand-held menu with descriptions. There were a lot of people there who seemed to know what to do so again maybe I am the only one feeling the need for an explanation. 
Food was ok, I think I have had much more delicious tacos and tostadas in Las Vegas with much better ambience and presentation. Price was good but I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Sort of confusing right when we walked in, was right into the dining room, we had to turn the corner and go down the hallway to start ordering. Food was amazing! Everything is ala carte, they have so many different types of meat and a good selection of salsas at their salsa bar."}
{"text":"Real good, authentic Mexican food. Good vibe. I had the carne asada taco and mulas. I'm now a huge fan of mulas. Next time I'll order my drink first because by the time it was made, my food was cold. Still tasted great. I think the lights could be turned down inside just a little to give it a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great al pastor tacos! I love the happy hour too! Staff is always friendly! Best tacos and nachos in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I liked the idea, but the taco was not \"amazing\".  

For sure will try again if I am in the area and hungry for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Gotta  this place!!!!!
    Only my 2nd time here, my husband is a regular he ABSOLUTLY LUVS the El Pastor tacos, he raves about them.....,
     My fist visit I did indulge in taco y taco carnitas tacos & yes quite, quite good on the handmade corn tortillas and all fresh ingredients~this time I decided on a different route........almost went the Gran Taco however opted fo a burrito and MAN O MAN WAS IT DELISHHHHHJ~ again with the carnitas ( oh so good, juicy, flavorful, not to spicy for this Gringa! )  also LUV that they offer 2 different bean selections & 2 different guacamole options!!!!! She steamed my flour tortilla, added my options then rolled it and placed it in a grill so it was slightly crispy & warm~ just heavenly to me. 
    Another nice feature is the full bar , I ordered a margarita, accepted an upgraded tequila recommendation from the bartender and it was possibly the BEST margarita I have EVER had!!! REALLY & only $7 bucks a total DEAL, in my opinion  
    I also like the decor of Taco y Taco. Clearly it is a restaurant, however it does have a clubby vibe, as I believe it was some sort of nightclub in a previous life.
   If your on Eastern near 215 check Taco y Taco it will make you feel Muy Bueno"}
{"text":"The food is fresh made and absolutely delicious.

Food wise I'd say 4 to 5 only reason I'm going with 4 is that its shows approximate spend as $ meaning less than $10... I wouldn't consider myself a big eater, but little street tacos are $2.25 each. Between my husband and I we spent $30.... All tacos and 1 drink. But.....

I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos were good and cheap but on the night I went there was a 6 piece mariachi band complete with trumpets blasting away in the dining room.  Being it's a high ceiling the entire restaurant was echoing with these high pitched blasting trumpets; reminded me of high school band practice where everyone is warming up, that kid behind you decides to blast full force from his trumpet in the back of your head and you go \"AHH!\"

Anyway thank god for the outdoor patio.  After I sat down I realized I forgot to grab hot sauce but didn't dare to go back inside."}
{"text":"Clean. Amazing clean. It might be too clean for my liking.

The service is great. They got it lockdown. The homies for sure.

The food. I can't complain. I've had every protein. Top 3 goes lengua, tripa, and buche. Bomb dot com.

The mariachi band on Mondays is a nice addition. It automatically makes everything super authentic."}
{"text":"The Best meal I had the 3 days I was in Vegas. Nothing fancy, just delicious. It cost $17 for the both of us. It was definitely tastier than our bland Gordon Ramsey meal at Caesars palace."}
{"text":"Love their salsa bar with bean option.
Tacos aren't bad just they get cold rather quickly. I can order a carne Asada taco and then want a carnitas taco but the cook has to jump from one station to another to get it for me. 
Staffing seems limited ): 
Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite taco spot here in Vegas second to tacos el gordo. Their food and venue is on point. Can't go wrong with al pastor or the chicharron!"}
{"text":"Barbacoa tacos are yummo, rice is seasoned good! Meat Is tender and flavorful,  great salsa bar w free beans (black or pinto) with a cold beer and dinner is complete."}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada bowl with everything and the meat was TOO DAMN SALTY. But the elote, oh my word! It was fucking amazing!"}
{"text":"I love their tacos! The al pastor tacos in particular are delicious. We normally also get al pastor fries, as well, which are amazing.

It has a great space and tons of seating.

The biggest downside is the set up. Getting the tacos is the easiest part and the fastest but after that, the wait for anything else such as burritos, fries, nachos, etc., is pretty long. If they switched the setup, I think it would be way more efficient.

Price wise- it's pretty fair. About $2 a taco and about $7 for a burrito. So definitely nothing crazy!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been to this restaurant. First we didn't know what to do because there is like 4 lines to Stand in to get different items and know one really helps you. We order our food and then we order our sides separately. I got tacos and corn Mexican styled it was called. The food was ok. Reminding me of a food truck but only inside of a restaurant. It's had a bar area but it had like 4 seats at the bar. There was also a second floor for eating your food, we didn't go up there but I did see the stairway. Everything was ok. They don't use regular plates everything was paper and plastic. When you walk in, it looks like it's going to be a fancy place but it's not at all. It's sort of like a Mexican Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"It was slightly complicated to order food at Taco y Taco. However, The staff behind the counter will guide you to the right direction. 
It took me a good solid minute to make sure I was at Taco y Taco from outside of the restaurant. Because the sign was missing the Y! Maybe I am blind. 

So, I walk in proudly from the wrong side of entrance to the restaurant. AKA: EXIT! I felt like a dumb lost tourist on the strip, but anyway, I attempt to place an order for some tacos trying to pronounce the meat selections in spanish and they understood me. Whoo hooo!!! 

Burritos are awesome!! You can customize it like the Subway. Tacos are super tasty! Free grilled green onions and Jalapenos!!! And there is a freaking sink near the taco station!! Thats a big plus for me because I have OCD, very mild one, I just like to wash my hands before I eat. They have corns and Coronas are only $2.50!!!! Say what?!?!???
I am like give me a case of Coronas!! and take my money already!!

I really like this place! super clean and staff are extremely helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"A upscale taco shop, Has a bar, and beer always goes good with tacos. Very good Mexican street corn! Delicious tacos and there salsa' s are amazing."}
{"text":"BEST TACO PLACE IN VEGAS THUS FAR!

Yes, I think it's better than El Gordo's. It's the same concept, but cleaner and trendier. Lines are shorter, and the food is not as salty. So definitely better in every way shape and form.

First of all, I love the ambiance. It's young, hip, trendy, fun. Totally casual date worthy

Food is excellent!  You have to get in different lines for different meats but the lines are reasonable and service is efficient and friendly. It's also nice that the meat dudes all speak reasonable English since my Spanish isn't the best and it's nice to be able to ask questions. 

EVERYTHING I've had has been delicious. Personal favorites are al pastor with extra pineapples, and carne asada. and the MEXICAN CORN!!! LOVE.

This is my new favorite taco joint in town. Thanks Taco y Taco."}
{"text":"Great place to get some street tacos. I tried a beef, a pork, and a chicken taco. I would have to say the pork is the best meat they have there. Everything was tasty, the tortillas were fresh, they loaded up the tacos with plenty of juicy meat, and they topped the tacos off with fresh avocado and sauces."}
{"text":"I'm content. The food was perfect. No complaints from this guy. I wouldn't mind driving 30 min to eat here."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to my boyfriend and I.

We LOVE this place, we go every time we're in town.

The make everything by hand, everything you pick is put together right in front of you.
Tacos are to die for. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos, I hate the set up. We walked in and just deciding on what lines to order from because depending on what you want you have to order from 4 different lines. But as were standing looking at the menu we have three different guys yelling at us asking what we want. Clearly were staring at the menu to decide. Street tacos were fantastic but the seafood tacos I would pass on. Street corn was good but not hot. Average taco place."}
{"text":"Never been here before but after hearing the ads and reading the reviews we thought we would give it a try for lunch.

Three stars and that's only because it was quick and cheap but unmemorable. Walking in, the place was clean, semi-busy, no long lines at the cashier. Actually, there weren't any designated lines anywhere. So if it's your first time, look forward to finding your way around or asking a fellow customer how to maneuver around the restaurant. 

After we found out who to ask for food, we grabbed a tray and placed our order. Ordered a quesadilla, tacos and corn on the cob. Quesadilla was loaded with cheese, cut up and placed one on top of the other so I had to eat it with a fork and knife because they were too heavy and soggy to lift. Overall food lacked flavor and was unmemorable. 

Now that I know what to do, I'll give this place a second try, at night during one of their busy night events."}
{"text":"Food is very good, not your standard Mexican fast food like Chipotle in the taste department. A suggestion, several of the meats they have are strange, like intestines, cow head etc. they are all listed in Spanish, so I googled them.they have a great condiment counter, self served. I had a brisket bowl (Suadero) with rice,pinto beans, guacamole,and pico de gallo,  and marinated mushrooms, husband had tacos"}
{"text":"This place has the best authentic mexican food! Staff is friendly atmosphere great great priced food  el pastor taco mexican corn and asada taco is a must have!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I want to say that like my first visit, this place is not well organized and getting food takes longer than to eat. 

Again the food wasn't too bad, although the quesadilla was not my cup of tea. It could've been the fact that the lady dropped one of my quesadillas and made the second in a rush. I couldn't tell if it tasted weird because there was too much cheese, undercooked or maybe it was overcooked ...? 

My annoyance with the lines is probably enough to make me think twice before going again."}
{"text":"Real good tacos if you're in Vegas, and if you need your Taco fix.
Get the pollo, and carne asada tacos. The salsa is amazing. I love the red one, and it can be a little spicy. Mexican food is the best food on earth.

Who doesn't love Tacos? If you do, check out Taco Y Taco."}
{"text":"I think their al pastor tacos are really good, if not one of the best I've tried so far. I love that it has mangos in it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat at it is authentic Mexican food and done right came here yesterday in the evening with a friend of mine and her two kids she's been here before but this was my first time being here and I have to say that I like this place they have a station that you can stand at depending on what you want you tell the cook that's making it he makes it in front of you and your orders ready to go and you can go to the salsa area and choose what kind of toppings you want the people here are friendly it's very clean not sure about the bathrooms because I didn't go into the men's bathroom but judging by how they keep the restaurant clean I'm pretty sure it's the same overall I plan to make the trip here again the only negative about this place is it is pretty pricy especially when your coming with 4 people but that's my only gripe 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Taco y taco I've  heard a lot  about  this  place some  good  and  some bad. But I  like to make  my own  judgment. The service  was on point. The tacos were kinda  of mediocre the salsa bar was nice. The restaurant  was clean. But I was there for the tacos. Which like I said  b4 are kinda  blah, the meat had no seasonings which is  why  I'm giving  them  2 stars. Would I be back  yes after a couple of  beers and there was nothing  else  open."}
{"text":"7So I'm being charged $1.30c per taco with avocado even it doesn't expensify on their menu you are going to be charge extra for it so you are paying $2.25 yo per taco plus $1.30 if you want guacamole is just crazy.. and this is not the first time i come here but it is the first time im been charged again $1.30 per taco with guacamole... last time i eat or recommend this place!!! 


He venido a este lugar desde que llegue a vegas hace mas de 5 años es una lastima que los precios en los tacos como me gustan hayan aumentado tanto ridiculamente $1.30 por ponerle guacamole a cada taco encima de tu $2.25 por taco no dice nada al respecto en el menu y le dije al taquero llamado tony quien muy grosero respondio que no tenia que decir en ningun lado que el me estaba diciendo sobre ese cargo extra! Es una lastima despues de todo lo que he recomendado este lugar y visitadolo pero con empleados asi ya no regreso.."}
{"text":"Love this place, best tacos and the street corn is so good, can't go wrong here, also happy hour is great"}
{"text":"you guys need somebody to buss the tables every time i want to sit down they look like the trashcan"}
{"text":"Came here the day after they opened. The lay out is a little confusing, since this place is essentially a taco shop in a really fancy restaurant. But the staff was really nice explaining how everything worked. We even got samples of a  few different types of meat! 

After 20 minutes of indecision we went with Lengua(Tongue), Cabeza(Cheek meat), Al Pastor (Pork), and Asada tacos, along with an Al pastor bowl. We also tried all of their salsas and extras, and EVERYTHING was delicious! Their al pastor specifically was excellent, and the lengua and cabeza tacos were also great! We regretted not getting the mexican street corn since it seemed like everyone ordered it. 

Definitely coming back since it's delicious food at a reasonable price. This location is also much closer to us than all the other locations around Vegas."}
{"text":"The price and food were delicious. The atmosphere is out of this world. See photos!  Everything is fresh, made to order. The salsa & sides are delicious and plentiful. The beer selection is a little weak, imho. But this place is worth the visit. We had beef tacos. All four of us lived it. & the price is really reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! The meat melts in your mouth and nothing beats fresh corn tortillas! Took my daughter here today with her friends for a bday luncheon and everyone loved it! The elote was ok I still think the ones I buy off the street in LA for $1 are better but hey I'm not gonna complain! The staff are so helpful and since it was I first time there they explained and helped us through! They were all so very friendly! I will mos def be back. 

P.s they have a dj there that is awesome! I almost thought I was at a club on the strip mind u it was 1:30pm."}
{"text":"This is my go to taco place! The staff is super friendly. I always get the barbacoa taco's. Sometimes I stray and get chicken. They always put on a perfect amount of cilantro. Their avocado sauce is a must try!! The sope is also very tasty! We have brought many friends here who have also loved it. I can't wait to eat here again soon."}
{"text":"I went here looking for a good taco to rival one of my favorites a bit closer than the strip. The food was pretty good albeit a bit of a wait. The restaurant was not as clean as I would expect. Overall I will return but it is still not a favorite!"}
{"text":"The guys that make you encounter upon ordering and get your food from are always cool. So are the cashiers. 
My usual choices of food include the lengua tacos, but lately I've been hitting up their area for their carne asada fries. LOL. They fry those potatoes fresh, and they never come up greasy! Yum! Plus their toppings (ex. guacamole) is as fresh as can be. 
Nice bar with a variety to impress at a taco joint, and I always hear the bartenders talking it up with patrons in their area. Overall, nice space to eat at or get your food to go."}
{"text":"Henderson people stop in for the best TACOS (not kidding).   There is all types of meats, al pastor, carnitas, carne asada just a few I named on the top of my head.  You need to order the ELOTE fully loaded.  

Workers are friendly and they remember me when I go in. I feel like it gives it a personal touch when the staff remembers you and what you like.  

Must try the flan, fresh and it's taste so good.   We love going in for our taco fix and I am never disappointed as it is always great there!!"}
{"text":"great tacos. had one of each. carnitas, suadero, buche, cabeza and al pastor. never had buche before, (pig stomach) great flavor, salty but with a kick. cabeza was very moist, topped onions and cilantro. carnitas was served the same. suadero, had the same but also topped with chili verde sauce. the standout had to be al pastor. topped with the meat was a creamy guac sauce and pineapple. impressed with flavor. very friendly employees. and to wash it down, i had an iced coffee. different from what im used to getting. had a hint of cinammon i think. but definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is an alternative to tacos el gordo. Since this location is much closer to me. The location is in a pretty nice area with many other food choices but I always come to this area for tacos! The ordering system might be confusing at first but so is all the other taco shops in town. 

I always tend to order the same thing: al pastor tacos, elite and a michelada! They're all so good. I used to get other tacos but I prefer to stick with my usuals because they never fail me!

I highly recommend this place if you're in the area or craving some tacos but can't get to tacos el gordo!"}
{"text":"There are so many choices.  Just get the chips and guacamole and some tacos of your choice.  Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"oh my fucking god these tacos are so damn good!!! best ive ever had.  and the workers are so fucking nice. and i want to thank alex the cashier for being so helpful and courteous:)))  will definitely be back with the homies."}
{"text":"Don't venture away from the tacos or you will be sorely disappointed. Honestly, it is better than Taco Bell but falls short of Los Tacos and Tacos el Gordo by a long shot. Great seating and looks very clean but the meat was luke warm and the guacamole was flavorless, if not unappetizing. The Mexican street corn was pretty beat as well--Cattle corn boiled too long and again kept luke warm. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and this place has been disappointing both times I have come. The price point is also relatively high to other great taco restaurants. I gave them 2 stars purely for the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and customer service! Definitely have the pastor tacos and a michaleda!"}
{"text":"Great laid-back vibe, live music a few nights a week, friendly folks, and real authentic food. Brought a friend from Monterrey and after we devoured our tacos al pastor, carnitas, barbacoa, lengua and some rocking elote he declared, \"just like the best taco trucks in Monterrey, but clean!\" 

Not to mention I was pleasantly surprised by their beer selection - dead guy ale, rotating local beers, and more."}
{"text":"Chiiiiiiiihuuuooooouuuu 
*mexican whistle*

Best taco shop in Las Vegas 

I'm from San Diego where we keep the mexican food 1 hunnit A11 D4Y,And this is just as good.

They also have vegetarian options, so for the homies representing that xVEGx life \"come through\""}
{"text":"This place has a pretty nice vibe. It's kind of an upscale fast food taco shop. The ordering process was odd. This line for this and this line for that. Definitely not fast food taco prices. We had 2 bowls and 2 fountain drinks and it came to just under $30

I had a chicken bowl. The chicken was good but overall the food lacked flavor. You definitely have to add some from the salsa bar which had tons of options to choose from. 

It was very clean and the staff was friendly. They have a ton of seating downstairs and upstairs. I went early in the day during the week so it wasn't very busy. 

I noticed you could order adult beverages at their bar which would be awesome if I was going for dinner."}
{"text":"Always love my experience when I come! The cooks are always fun to talk to! And the lady on the register is always welcoming!!"}
{"text":"Please, please, please change your ordering process.  And please, please, please change your  ordering signage.  Every time I go there I get so confused and so frustrated that I never want to go back.

Apparently, you must get in line according to the type of meat you want but on the signs, the meat is in small letters. What if I want one chicken taco, one pork taco and one chorizo taco? Do I have to get in line 3 times? Then you must choose one of four types of tacos but there are no descriptions on the signs and no menus to read. What is a Vampiro?  What is mula?  And why are those choices in larger letters then meat choices when the line I choose must be by the meat I want?  The third line is for Al Pastor.  What the heck is Al Pastor?  There is no description on the sign. However there was a large spinning hunk of meat that looked pretty good so I chose that. Then I had to choose my type of taco. Not knowing what any of these taco choices were because there's no description on the sign I pleaded for a menu. All of them were corn tacos or corn tortillas. Because I do not like corn tortillas I asked for a flour tortilla. The employee told me I had to go to the other side of the room to order a flour tortilla even though I was in the right line for the meat I wanted.  With my frustration growing exponentially and my family getting annoyed at all of my questions, I settled for a corn tortilla just to get the ordering process over with and because I didn't want to start all over again and wait in line on the other side of the room.  

Although the ingredients tasted great, I hated my corn tortilla! Of course that ruined the whole taco.

Upon reading the five most recent reviews, everyone complained about being confused with the ordering process. Taco y Taco,  please change your ordering process. I don't think I could take another frustrating, annoying experience regardless of how good your food is. Thank you."}
{"text":"The barbacoa and carnitas tacos with everything are some of  the best tacos I have ever eaten. Be sure to order your tacos with everything to get the pico de gallo and guacamole. I can't wait to try the mole fries next time I am there."}
{"text":"Good bye Taco Bell and Roberto's. Taco Y Taco will be the only place I will ever get tacos or burritos at. I guess I'm a little late hopping onto the train but I'll give you some pointers before you go. You might feel like $2.50/taco is a little pricey but they do have the typical side items you find at Roberto's such as the salsas, cucumbers and what not and this location is just too fancy to have it be a fast food place. 

#1: Do your research. Look on yelp for pictures of the menu and learn what the Spanish words mean. With so many cow parts, pig parts to choose from, you really won't know which to get (or order one of each). However, of the ones I tried, the Al Pastor (pork) and the Tripas tacos were the best. 

#2: DO GET THE CORN. Sweet, juicy, covered in butter and parmesan cheese. Yum-O. 

#3: Get all 8 sauces/salsas. Don't question what the bright green, pale green, red, orange ones are. Just get them and dip everything in them. You'll eventually find your favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a group for their Taco Tuesday special during happy hour. Arrived before the rush around 5pm. Food was great. Service (bartender) was great for the most part but had to ask 3 times for them to wipe off a table that we wanted to sit at since it was still dirty from the previous diners. A customer shouldn't have to ask to get a table wiped off 3 times especially when the venue was not busy. 

Tried the following: 
Lengua Vamprio (Lengua: Beef tongue) Really enjoyed this. 
Taco Tuesday regular Chicken taco special. Onions or something on there was way too hot. 
Pibil: Marinated pork wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted. Really enjoyed this.

Will go back again during happy hour."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. I wouldn't say great but good. I don't know that I'd drive out of the way to eat here but if I was in the neighborhood & hungry I might."}
{"text":"Love my Quesadilla de pastor and the elote my boyfriend had 2 tacos and a burrito they were so good I will come back to this place."}
{"text":"When I crave tacos, this is my go to place! Great atmosphere, quick friendly service! And the Al Pastor is to die for! I tell everyone to try taco y taco, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place has some authentic Mexican tacos. Highly recommended! Will definitely come here again when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"A step above Robertos!

If you're looking for an authentic Mexican joint of tacos and burritos, this is not a bad place to try!

Tacos y tacos is located near Eastern and 215 in the same center as Cafe Zuppas, Smash Burger, and Twin Peaks.

Restaurant is roomy and clean. We went on a Friday night and they had a DJ which was pretty neat.

It was very crowded tonight and when we went up to order, it was so disorganized. This was a our first time coming here so we had no clue on how their ordering system went. We can see the different stations but we weren't sure as to who we place our order with etc etc.

We ordered the asada burrito, asada taco grande, asada nachos, and Elote (Mexican style corn).

Large portions for fairly cheap prices. Meat was a bit on the dry side. Definitely not healthy food so stay away if you're on a diet. 

I would recommend trying this place over Roberto's and if u want to venture out from Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great food. Menu can be a little confussing for us amateurs.  Love the radishes and great setting.  No worries, just ask those around you about their favorites."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. If you haven't been here your really not living. Check it out and tell me what you think."}
{"text":"Not really happy with the tacos , I think the whole point of  slow cook the pastor make's the difference .. Even they had it the served my tacos from a bowl , meat was cold and dried , I came from far away but got disappointed .."}
{"text":"My fave was the Mulas: 2 tortilla with cheese then some carved pork with pineapple, cilantro and onions $4
The other tacos were ok but nothing great. I got chicken and shrimp. 
Wish there were description of some of the items because I had no idea what was inside. I just saw a guy in front order the mula and it looked good so I asked for the same thing."}
{"text":"These tacos are unique. Not exactly the best thing my taste buds have experienced but they're ok. The service was good, I remember when this was the republic, they've totally redone the place and made it very unique. That seems like the only thing I can think of to describe this place. Very unique. My friend really enjoyed it so 4 stars to taco y taco"}
{"text":"This place is on the verge of five stars.  Here is what went right with the place: great tacos, taco stations were quick, salsa bar was good and plentiful, they had different creations (vampiros), and their nachos were spot on.
Here is what is wrong with the place: no fish tacos, the cashiers were horrible-they couldn't figure out the card machine and it took five of them crowding around the machine to figure out how to work it, and did I mention no fish tacos?  I feel like that is a must!

I will go back... But I hope they at least figure out the credit card machine before I do."}
{"text":"The carne asada fries were pretty good but no wow factor. Decent portion for the price though!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting 3 stars is because the corn was amazing! The burrito bowl I got was dry and old tasting. There was nothing exciting about it or had any developed flavors worth talking about. Very basic tasting Mexican food with a cool and hipster like interior of restaurant ."}
{"text":"I cannot stop thinking about the Al Pastor and the Elote (Mexican Corn) !!!

Hands down best Mexican food I've had so far! And so close to home!!! 

Their menu is huge!
You get to choose if you want burritos, tacos, nachos, fries, bowls.. Then they have 12 kinds of meat to choose from and they have veggie toppings, ie soyrizo (soy chorizo).. Variety of toppings.. And a big side and sauces bar.. I mean can you ask for more?!

I had the Al Pastor nachos with an Elote.
The meat was tender, toppings (guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, cheese) were fresh and homemade, and the nachos were crisp!
Meat to toppings to chips ratio was good!

I know it's just corn but their Elote was sooooo good !!! I don't know how such a simple thing can pack so much flavor!! 

I wish I would've gone for the $2 tacos to try different meats like the carne asada or carnitas .. but now this only means I HAVE to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican food but were in Henderson and there isn't many good taco shops. But taco y taco never disappointed us. I made my own taco bowl with a mix of asada and grilled shrimp. I was a little disappointed in the carne asada, It was shredded and didn't have much flavor. I opted for the Spanish rice but that too didn't have much flavor and didn't taste very authentic. The best part of the meal was the corn on the cob and beer!"}
{"text":"This is our Wednesday night ritual and has been for months now! Every time consistently amazing food from tacos to bowls to fries all so yummy and great service! The bartender even gave us a complimentary taste of a new cocktail he was working on! Can't wait til Wednesday to go back for more! My one year old eats Pastor tacos there and loves them! I would recommend pastor, suadero, and the chicharron tacos, only complaint is the chorizo could be better but with so many other options who cares!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in Las Vegas! Right as you step in you know you're getting a good meal. I had the el pastor and shrimp tacos. The shrimp was good but the el pastor was amazing. Not to mention the decor and the bar is outstanding. I fully recommend this place. Come for happy hour and get cheap drinks and tacos :)"}
{"text":"I had a very good Carne Asada and pollo Gran taco. They were very tasty and the staff was friendly. The tacos included beans, pico de gallo and guacamole, each was tasty. 2 were fairly filling, as they were  much larger than a street taco"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the reviews. We walked in and they were super friendly (We must have looked lost because they walked us through how to order. They also offered us a lot of samples of the different meats.  After trying 12 different ones (including cows tongue - which was really good until I found out what it was) we settled on the Asada Burrito and a couple of tacos. The shredded beef is awesome so is the Al Pastor (marinated pork). I found the salsa bar had some great variety and the ones I tried were really good.  I'll stop again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"A must every time I come to Vegas, I can't really find a place like this where the tacos are so well served in LA."}
{"text":"This place is completely disorganized their ordering system doesn't make sense. Why have people stand around in one line when the rest of the staff is doing nothing. There was too much pineapple (which I never asked for) in the tacos , more than meat. And who puts pineapples on a taco. For some reason there are no lids for the sauce containers, what do people do if they order to go like I did? They got my order wrong and had to buy it anyway, seems like you need to be fluent in Spanish to get what you want. Employees not speaking English doesn't make this place authentic."}
{"text":"Ok, I thought I loved this place when Molly and I would frequent it for our al pastor taco fix. But, a few days ago my co worker introduced me to al pastor breakfast burrito for $5.50. I was in love... with the burrito, not the co worker. The staff is always friendly and accommodating, there is a full salsa bar and the prices are beyond reasonable. I will drive out of my way for the breakfast burrito, it is THAT good."}
{"text":"Their tacos al pastor are absolutely amazing!  I landed in Vegas about a half hour ago and came straight here for a late dinner before heading to my hotel. This place is on my must-go list for every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My first few times here I loved the tacos. This last time was a let down. Nothing stood out and the ordering system is really annoying. Stand in one line get your taco, hold your tacos on a tray and they get cold while you wait in the next line, etc. There are a total of 4 lines plus a 5th to pay. That is a bit much if you want different things. 

The cashier was popping her pimples and then taking money and handing over cups. I don't know what other food items she touches, utensils? napkins? but I really wish people had a little more work ethic when it comes to working with food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place, he ordered a bowl for me and the rice was delicious. There are vegetarian and sea food options which I appreciated. The chips and guacamole are delicious, however the qua smile had a slight kick so be wary for your younger children. It is a bit loud and overwhelming with the chefs cutting the near but I got used to it. Overall I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"All time favorite for tacos - street style. Great options for vegetarians as well. They have specials during the week. Very clean and quick."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick, authentic mexican food, this is the place to go! It was so good I'm a little embarrassed to admit how much I ate...but all of it was delicious! The corn on the cob with the butter and seasonings was amazing. Try all of the complimentary salsa. Each taco is small, so I recommend getting a couple different kinds"}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars. But the reason i dont is because I've been there once a week for the past 4. The first time the tacos al pastor were excellent!  But they cant keep the consistency.  Today was lacking salt (and I usually eat low in salt).  
I'll give it a rest for now. 
The guys/girls working there are really nice by the way"}
{"text":"I had a client who insisted on eating here after closing on there first home. Not only did I ENJOY being a witness to there happiness but the food was DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"My new obsession! Tacos are amazing Home-Made chips & salsa bar so so good Plus they have a bar!"}
{"text":"Absolutely everything was delicious.  DJ in the background.... Nice place.  The different windows to order from gets getting used to.  But overall great!"}
{"text":"Love the Vampiros they are the BOMB!! The salsa bar is amazing!! They sell beer which is a plus for me with my MEXICAN FOOD. My kids love it here as well and they are picky eaters. My husband loves the pastor tacos. I have gone to the Eastern location as well it is pretty crowded in there but they have a second floor to eat and they have flat screens with a bar."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best PASTOR tacos ever! Had a chorizo sope too that was great. Yummy smothered fries. Elote, vegetarian options. Everything was delicious and fresh. I'm sad to leave it behind, and that's saying something cause I'm from L.A!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! Even better than Gordos! The extras are free, where normally most taquerias charge extra for, like the beans and the grilled chiles and green onions. They also have awesome fresh jugos (juices) for beverages, salsas, elotes (corn) and I think the tortillas for the tacos asada are home made. I have been here twice already and coming back for more.
There are 3 separate lines for different meats, so make sure to get your tray ready and tips in hand as they will hook it up! The 4th and final line is the check out line to pay for all the grub! 
I would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for my favorite taqueria back home, \"La Pasadita\" in Chicago IL."}
{"text":"I was torn with this place... 

We stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy so we were able to browse the menu and find seating without a problem.  There is one line for the al pastor tacos, another line for all other types of tacos and another station for nachos or bowls.  The al pastor looked really good as he was carving it off for my taco.  Honestly, it didn't have as much flavor as I hoped it would.  Don't get me wrong.  It was good... just not memorable.  The nachos were ok.  Again I had the al pastor for the meat topping.  Bummer.  Not so much flavor.  

I will definitely say their contemporary decor and a DJ spinning the tunes as I walk in was definitely a surprise.  I wish they would clean the tables a little more often upstairs though.  

I had high hopes and was disappointed."}
{"text":"The \"Y\"  inserted in \"Taco y Taco\" must stand for YUMMY right?? Because that's what they are! FINALLY I found a really good place for my taco fix!!

Not only do they have a variety choices of meats like Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Lengua,  Tripas, they also have vegetarian choices and the make a mean crunchy taco with soyrizo! (pic - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-y-taco-las-vegas?select=yC13HfZPcIaWAYI-_IZIGA#yC13HfZPcIaWAYI-_IZIGA) The seasonings worked well and I would order it even if it wasn't Meatless Monday!
 
The Go Tos - Al Pastor - rotating on a spit..well marinated. Every visit so far the slices I got have always been juicy and meat was never tough.
 
Lengua - My personal favorite! Meat is so tender and seasoned right!

Elote/Corn - Mexican street style is THE way to go! They roll it in creamy buttery mayo and sprinkle it with seasonings. So good!
 
Salsa Bar - the creamy looking green sauce is my favorite and apparently pretty popular because it's the one that always needs to be refilled. It's a mild salsa. (I cant handle too much heat)
 
All the meats sizzling on their grill, I was told by their employees come straight from the meat market Los Compadres, because the owners (Taco y Taco's) dad own that grocery store.
 
The Drill - Self Serve for dining or to go orders -  Walk up to each of the designated stations and they'll take and custom make your order, pay and order your drinks with the cashier at the end.  Salsa bar located in the dining room area.
  
The staff is cool people!! Friendly! First time we were there they were so helpful.  

The place is clean. The strip mall itself is clean. Parking is no problemo.
  
I like the set up of the dining area. Open and bright. Plenty of seating! Hmmm perfect for a UYF! (Unofficial Yelp FIESTA!)"}
{"text":"The food is great but get here early before any rushes. This place is like a typical Tacos El Gordo in TJ but with a more youthful modern flare. You walk into a line that's designated for the type of dish you want. If you want tacos al pastor, go here. If you want tacos adobada, then go here. Then you wait for a few minutes, sometimes longer when people are confused and start cutting into your line, you order your food and they prepare it right in front of you. You then place it on your tray and as you walk towards the register you pick up some elotes from the corn guy and maybe some chips. Then you pay, then walk to your table and blissfully scarf down that great adobada meat."}
{"text":"Only other place I could compare this to would be Tacos El Gordo....aaaaand I think they might have them beat! EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"I'm agitated by the time I sit down with my food. 

So many different eateries I go to, I understand the delivery system. Self-serve, buffet, seat yourself, order/pay at counter then take that thingamajig number to your table, and of course my favorite, full wait help service! But at Taco y Taco, I look at the menu board, see the different ordering stations, the cashier to the side, and I don't understand! I do understand, I just don't see how it's a good system. 

So if I wanted an Al Pastor taco, I stand and wait in that line, then if I want a quesadilla for my son, I wait in this other line, order, and wait for that.  Which line is to order the corn? Each station has a couple of guys back in that general area, but you don't know who takes what order, you just wait till someone asks you or make eye contact with one. So finally, I pile all my food onto a tray and make it to the cashier line, wait, pay, then wait at the salsa bar line. Yes, I'm serious. Hallelujah, I finally get to sit, only to realize I forgot my napkins. Where's the napkins line?

I've tried this location twice. I won't review the food, because I don't think I've tasted enough of these tacos elsewhere to know how good they are comparatively. Food was ok, I don't crave any to go back in a hurry. Plus, I've heard about their recent health demerits. 

I appreciate  the music and the vibe, and that they offer vegetarian options. I liked sitting upstairs and prices are reasonable. Will I be back? Probably not. I'm not on the Taco y Taco bandwagon, but I'm ok with that.  I'll go look for a taco shop where there's only one line."}
{"text":"Great location cool atmosphere inside 
Definitely a must when in the mood for really good authentic Mexican food...skip chipotle and try this place out. Service was great too! Alpastor was my favorite very unique flavors and not something you can order a lot of places in town."}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious cheap food! Very interesting fun decor. It's great for a late night snack or lunch. Staff is friendly and the options are great! Fast and easy. Their fries are really really good and huge size ! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"My coworker told me here as a good Tacos place.  I found it is nice, clean, friendly, but it was not-so-kind/confusing for a first comer. I had Tacos, which taste a bit too simple to me."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" experience here because all my Yelper friends are big fans of this establishment. Unfortunately it was just \"A-OK.\"

Coming into the restaurant, I was already intimidated because of the ordering process. After my first time anxiety passing over and giving myself time to read the menu, it was just any other ordinary taqueria ordering process. 

My boyfriend and I decided on carne aside and carnitas tacos and al pastor fries to share. The tacos were great; they were tasty and the meats were cooked tenderly. The al pastor fries though, could be better, to be honest. The fries came with guacamole, cheese, pico di gallo, crema and pineapples. The pineapples were actually a disappointment on the plate; I didn't think it paired well with the al pastor fries at all. The fries were also under done (I usually like my fries to be thick and crispy, but these fries with thick and soggy.)

One thing I really like though, is there self serve condiment station filled with goodies. Their hot sauces were great and the condiment bar was fully stocked.

3/5 stars, mainly because the price didn't justify their quality. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Easily my fav Tacos in Vegas. The quality of meat is top notch here, unlokt many other taco spots in Vegas that serve a very fatty chewy carne asada. Taco y Taco serves up super flavorful and perfectly charred and juicy carne asada. Theres also a full bar and an upstairs at this location. The tacos shine here, but the fries and vampiro were also very very good."}
{"text":"Ok I saw this place on Yelp, looked at the photos and since I saw corn on the cob Mexican style which I like and buy all the time from street vendors decided to hit this joint during my stay here in Vegas. 

The corn on the cob was good but not better than the usual street vendors that sell in Orange County , Ca - Anaheim. 

However I decided to try a taco el-pastor and I can tell you that it was the best taco I have ever had. 
I used to think that Pollo Locco had better food than Del Taco and Taco Bell. This place puts both of those so far behind that they seem equal. 
If you try the taco el pastor go to the salad at and dip it into their spicy red sauce!

The \"red sauce\" which is what they call it is AMAZING. 
If you know of better tacos than here throughout Vegas please let me know."}
{"text":"For a town that has so many places to get tacos,  this one is good but not amazing.  The atmosphere is like a mix between a \"dirty\"taco truck and a hip gastro pub which is neat,  but other than that,  the actual food was only ok.  I did like the selection of salsas and option fur street corn though."}
{"text":"What a tasty place! My friend brought me here for lunch and recommended the el pastor. The tacos may appear small but it is stuffed with whichever meat/veggies you choose. I got the el pastor and a fish taco. The sauces that came with the tacos were already delicious or you can go to the sauce and salsa bar and make your own if you wish. We also split the corn that was immersed in cheese. I recommend adding some lime juice on top."}
{"text":"This is a cool looking taco shop. The first thing you see I a massive cooking area behind a counter. 

Then it gets confusing: first you must magically know that it's a segment of stations that you stop and order from and not just one counter. So if you come in from the entrance overlooking pecos, you will be in the Section that servers the fish, and shrimp tacos, burritos, and Al Pastor Fries only. 

Second: unless you one just one thing, your food will get cold. You then have to go down the line with your fries getting cold, as you wait to order your next round of carnitas tacos or carne Asada tacos, and in the end you get the Al Pastor area, plus the line for drinks, cashier. 

Third: being different sometimes only works when it make sense: I know this is a popular way to have tacos in different places but I don't think it holds well here and makes the ordering process slow, clumsy and slow. 

Our first food order was literally cold by the time we got down the line to the Pastor section since we had a pileup on the carnitas Section, that comment is for a freeway not a taco shop! 

Fourth: Restrooms. The men's restroom was worse than a New York subway restroom. Graffiti can be cool but this was not. No hand soap! NO Hand soap ! What is everyone that works there washing their hands with of the restroom has no soap."}
{"text":"Excellent. I have been searching for a great street tacos since I moved to Vegas. Love it and will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is literal bullshit. I come here at 11 in the morning and ask for a chicken burrito. The people working tell me that they \"ran out\" of chicken and then 15 minutes later say that they'll have some in 30 minutes. First off it doesn't take 30 minutes to cook fucking chicken. As someone who only eats white meat and cooks chicken all the time this was bullshit. Not only did they not have chicken but their line system is stupid and unorganized as fuck. I will definitely not be recommending this place to any of my friends or anyone who asks me how this place is. If I could give a zero star review believe me I would."}
{"text":"Way too over priced. $2.75 per drink. Not very happy with service either. You sell tacos and bowls with meat but you don't have chicken? Super unhappy with this place. Its my first time here and I had high expectations. Its also too loud to where you can't here the servers or your family. Still baffles me that you don't have chicken.. ridiculous."}
{"text":"The food tasted delicious and was for a great price! The inside was well lit and has great spacious seating. The chicarron tacos are fabulous and the veggie burrito surprisingly has a lot of flavor. The flavors are fairly authentic and the Mexican street food style make this a nice place to sit down and eat with some friends."}
{"text":"Most of the authentic Mexican taco place are located in north LV area, but since Taco Y Taco opened on Eastern in Henderson, I do not have drive that far to cure my taco cravings. 

I stopped by this location to try their pastor tacos and their carne asada fries. This place is located in a very busy plaza next to smash burger and many other restaurants. Its very clean inside, if you are trying to eat in. I prefer to do a take out and so I did. The carne asada fries with their mole sauce and guacamole was delicious, but the tacos were on another level. The flavor was perfect and small sweetness from the pineapple made it more enjoyable. They also have very unique condiments, and I would highly recommend trying out the creamy cilantro sauce on you tacos. 

Overall (4/5) - great"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place fairly often. The last time I went will definitely be my last. I ordered nachos and a chicken quesadilla. After paying (almost $20), I asked for some cups for the salsa bar. I was given two cups and after walking away, I went back to ask for more cups. After all, the salsa bar selection was one of my favorite things about this place. I was told that I was only allowed to have two salsa cups and would not be given any more. Even when I offered to pay for them! It was a fun time being your customer since you opened, Taco y Taco. Sorry it had to this way."}
{"text":"There isn't many taco places that carry pretty much any type of meat that you desire! Taco y Taco carries the best tripas tacos on Las Vegas! The lines are split up by what you want to order so it can go a little faster if you like the less popular ones ! The prices are fairly high but you are paying for the quality ! Not an everyday thing because of the price but definitely a once in a while outing!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by the number of workers that looked up at me and continued to go about their business. No signage or friendly instruction to place order at wherever they take the order (Still don't know, as I simply left after a family of four came in and looked sheepishly at me as we all waited for a greeting, whatever. 

Lots of places in Las Vegas with far fewer, far friendlier staff, who would like to have the business. It's tacos, not rocket science, and lots of friendly places sell them in Henderson too."}
{"text":"The food is great, no complains there. Only complain is the ordering process, have to go on different lines to get tacos and burritos."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here a few days ago and we were happy with what we ordered. We came in to have a late lunch (2pm) and it was confusing at first to figure out how to order. 

There is separate stations to order different type of foods (al pastor station, taco station, etc). Then you eventually end up at the end to pay at the cashier. We ordered Al pastor and chicharones tacos, with mole fries. 

The food was good but since we were waiting to go through each station, by the time we paid our food was warm instead of hot. The food was delicious and the ingredients were fresh except we wished the chicharones was crispier. I'm assuming since we came in late the crispiness was gone over all.

There is seating everywhere. I'm not sure if this place has always been Taco Y Taco, but there is 2nd story seating."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and have always wanted to have tacos like they do in Mexico. These tacos are identical to the ones you get in Mexico. Can't wait to go again and again. I highly suggest you give them a try. You won't be disappointed. ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Buy one pork taco and split into 2! With all the free extras, by far, the cheapest and most delicious meal in Las Vegas!! Can't wait to enjoy the live music they offer. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I am a big critic when it comes to tacos. These tacos are AMAZING. They should have 5 stars!! The indoor seating is very spacious and nice and clean. A must visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"A decent taco place near our apartment! Though not the best tacos I've had (which clearly goes to Tacos El Gordo), It would still satisfy any taco fanatic's soft taco cravings. From pastor (adobada), tripa, lengua, or the usual carne asada, Taco taco is definitely a place to bring your friends and have some guilty pleasures. Just make sure to wash your hands after."}
{"text":"Great al pastor tacos.  Asada and barbacoa are also great.  I eat here every chance I get."}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times I've been here. It is officially my favorite taco spot. Yes, it is a little pricier than most -- these are not $1 street tacos. But, the quality of the food and salsas more than makes up for it. This place has ruined me for every other taco spot I've frequented in Vegas, LA or Boston. First off, the tacos are served on hand made tortillas - not the tortillas out of the bag like at other places. The carne asada is cooked in thin steaks on the grill, allowed to get just a little bit of that char flavor, then chopped up fresh for your tacos. Served with guacamole! The al pastor is still spinning on a spit with a pineapple chunk on top. Served with a hot salsa, and bits of pineapple. The chicharron is served both crispy and soaked in chile verde - I recommend getting both kinds in your taco. The lengua is chopped fresh for your taco, and cooked perfectly. It seriously puts to shame the lengua tacos I've had anywhere else. 

Also, this place gives you the types of options you'd see at Chipotle, but with more authentic flavors and ingredients. You can get your burritos, bowls, quesadillas, even nachos and mole fries! They even have the street-style elotes (corn on the cob). AND Happy Hour specials on tacos and beer! 

If you haven't been here, you really don't know what you are missing. Make it a point to drop in, here or at the Tropicana & Pecos location. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place has about the same setup as Tacos El Gordo. Three stations to order your food from. It is cleaner, roomier  and newer than El Gordo. As soon as i walked in, I saw a familiar face, it was so funny. Jose used to work at El Gordo and now is the manager here! We ordered one taco of each of the meat (pork, chicken, beef)available, intestines, tongues. I think we ended up with 14 because some meats are cooked differently. We also had two vampiros and two Jarritos soda (pineapple and lime). There is a free salsa and sauce bar. Try the creamy light green one, it cools off the spiciness from the tacos. Everything is delicious, I think everyone in Vegas should make a trip here. :) The cashier also told me that they will be opening up a new location on Eastern soon, can't wait! I saw quite a few locals ordering burritos wrapped in tin foil to go. Maybe I will try one next time."}
{"text":"Came here because it was the only place my little sister wanted to go on her birthday. The street tacos are honestly the best i've ever had in Vegas, and the corn was TO DIE FOR. I've been here before, but I was reminded of just how good it is today. I will definitely be coming back more often. I can't get enough of the Tacos Al Pastor."}
{"text":"So glad this place is close to me, we needed a good Mexican restaurant in this area. The food is so good and the prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and a diehard Chipotle fan... After eating here though, Chipotle can drop off the map for all I care!  These views are spot on!!  The food is very affordable and unbelievably good!! I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a little taste of home!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good tacos. Not better than Tijuana. But the next best thing for being in Las Vegas. A little confusing their ordering and paying. Your tacos are kind of cold by the time you sit down and eat. Nice staff and love the salsa bar. Except i want my onions asados to be hot not warm in its juice."}
{"text":"I'll start with, the food is pretty good. Just like the other location, except this is more of a cafeteria style and a bit less divey. 

I am not a fan of the setup for multiple reasons. 1. It's confusing. I have no idea where I am ordering, if I am paying first then going to the counter to pick my toppings. I don't know which area I am supposed to order what food from. It is all crazy and unorganized. 2. The staff doesn't really care to help you figure out what you are supposed to be doing. I asked where I should order a breakfast burrito from, and the man behind the counter pointed at a area. However when I went to that spot, that woman said I should pay first, then come back. 3. Once I did order, I didn't get to select what I wanted to do inside the breakfast burrito. I had to shout, as she was rolling it up, \"Can I have some avocado?\". It was just a sloppy mess of a system. Speaking of sloppy mess, there were no to-go lids for the salsa bar, so that was a fun experience in the car, each of us juggling our salsas all the way home. Clearly, we were desperate.

Bottom line is, I have no idea what to do here, and if the staff helped you figure out where to order, and what the process was, I think this place would be great. The food is good, sure! But in a city full of wonderful Mexican food it is not worth it to deal with the strife of eating here."}
{"text":"They have THE BEST margaritas in town and their tacos are delicious and inexpensive. I always come here!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience here. First walked in with an entire group that was very confused where the line was. So I veered away from them and went to the bar. They served me faster than the people in line. Tacos were a little small, I had to have about 3 to feel full. I had the beef ones and I noticed maybe some pork or uncooked meat was in mine. I couldn't tell, I don't eat pork but it was more red and definitely wasn't beef. This shocked me but I just took it out and continued eating. I eat all organic so this food didn't upset me. It was pretty tasty actually. Very clean and upscale location. Lady I was next to said there's one on tropicana and this one was clearly nicer. They also have a cool upstairs seating area!"}
{"text":"Yes awesome Mexican tacos ! If you are a real carnivore (like me) this is the best taco place on this side of town! Get the al pastor tacos & a michelada. So yummy"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times now and it's always been good, not fantastic, but not horrible. It's loud, sometimes crowded, but has a very fun atmosphere. Food is usually very good although today I had the barbacoa and it was mostly fat rather than meat which is extremely disappointing. The beans on the salsa bar were cold however the salsa bar was surprisingly clean."}
{"text":"This place is great! I was craving for some fish and shrimp tacos and this place hits the spot. The shrimp and fish were grilled and normally in food trucks they're fried. 
Everything here is made fresh!

The food is very healthy and spicy with lots of veggies and guacamole. The only thing I would change about this place is to upgrade the seats and tables. But overall this place feels like Mexico. I am coming back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in MD but whenever we go to Vegas/Henderson, this is our spot! Never a complete trip unless we stop at Taco y Taco at least once! We absolutely love tacos and have yet to find a better and more authentic spot with the exception of when we actually stumbled upon one in a random neighborhood in Mexico!! The menu may be a little confusing for those who aren't familiar with the different dishes but trust...everything is amazing! And don't forget to grab some elotes!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch and dinner.  The food is good.  I love the mushroom tacos and corn. They have a great salsa bar and cocktails  I have been here many times. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"I stopped her for lunch after going to Sam's Club based on the reviews on Yelp and my review is strictly on their burrito. I didn't get any tacos, and that was probably what I should've done. Anyway to sum it up ....$9.25 FOR A BURRITO?!!???...$9.25???? And this wasn't some gigantic burrito it was very average sized. The burrito was good, the al Pastor was pretty spot on but DEFINITELY not worth $9.25. Stop ripping people off!"}
{"text":"If you want an upscale-looking place with a taqueria-size price tag, bookmark this place. After hearing so much, it's hard to see how the reputation fits in with the reality. Coming from San Antonio, I'm used to quality taqueria fare, and though this place tries to do an upscale version, I'm not fully on board.

Between the line backup (there's not enough space for separate meat counters!) and the music being too loud for employees to hear my order (a live mariachi in a cavernous space?!), there is a disconnect between the concept and the actual facilitation of business. 
Salsa bar has ridiculously tiny cups (without lids) and upstairs seating area lacks any sort of napkin/utensil station, warranting multiple trips up and down the narrow stairs. I appreciated that there were grilled onions, though. 

Execution issues aside, the food was just okay. By the time I got my corn and paid, my tacos were cold. The lengua, asada, and barbacoa were all mushy to the point that I wasn't sure which meat was which, and they should all be distinct. As others have said, I didn't care for the pineapple salsa on the asada. The corn was tasty, but the chips tasted like they'd been sitting out. I've been happier spending $12 at a taco truck, but I'd come back here at someone else's request."}
{"text":"My favorite taco shop in Henderson. My favorites are the lengua, suadero, and chicharron. They have the same setup as most other taco shops, so if you're familiar with the different lines for different meats it shouldn't confuse you. If you are new to this concept, basically just line up in front of the sign with the meat that you want to order. The food is good, service is quick. They have a huge beer selection compared to most taco places, they have a full bar with custom cocktails. The bartenders are always awesome and can get your food for you if you're drinking at the bar so you don't need to wait in line. The place is nice and clean. They have a huge salsa bar with many different kinds to suit any palate. A must try in the area."}
{"text":"AMAZING! ! Awesome Al Pastor Tacos. The corn on the cob looked amazing. Everything was fresh. Great salsa bar! Prices were really really good."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem in Henderson. A friend recommended this place, glad I came here. Once we entered there was a DJ playing some house music, which went with the vibe of the place, open and very inviting. There are about 3 stations where you order your food. We got 3 chicken tacos and 3 Carne Asada tacos with everything on it! Yummmmmm is all I can say, everything is freshly prepared and made right in front of you! I tried the tacos vampiros for the first time, and let me tell you this is my favorite now! Crunchy, cheesy, delicious explosion of flavors in su boca! I'm definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is bomb but when I saw it had a C for the Health Department that grossed me out. you have to be really dirty to get a C. wouldn't go back til it's an A."}
{"text":"A place for taco lovers, they have 3 stations you can line up for depending on the type of meat you want, and then a 4th side line for street corn burrito and chips before you check out. You may need to line up in multiple lines to get everything you want, but would definitely recommend not skipping the al pastor line. Also one of the few places you can get mexican style street corn (covered in mayo?, spices, and cheese), and to top it off they have some really bomb horchatta at the drink station. As an added bonus they are also open late on weekends and serve a vareity of beer and liquor."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great beers, great food. Chicken is killer, al pastor excellent. This is my go-to when I want authentic Baja tacos. Salsa bar is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Good Mexican street tacos & sides. My favorite were the adobada mulas & adobada fries. It's clean & casual with lots of seating. A good variety of salsas at the serve yourself salsa bar with spicy carrots & radishes. The only downfall is the set up for ordering. It's an \"L\" shape with different stations so when it's busy it can get hectic. But the food, prices & cleanliness of the place is why it is one of my family's local eats."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The ordering is a little complicated at first but after the initial visit easy.   Tacos are small so order a few."}
{"text":"This place is literally sooo good, reminds me of Cali tacos every time I go! I've never had a bad experience with the staff or the food, their meat is absolutely to die for! Don't go off of just the name, they certainly have way more of a variety than just tacos. My only \"complaint\" is that they're super pricey"}
{"text":"5 for food...2 for ordering process and layout. I reluctantly forced myself to finally come back to the former site of Fado for the first time in a long time. The food did not disappoint at all, it's some of the best authentic Mexican food I've had here in Vegas. However, the venue is not big enough for the ridiculous ordering process. I can only imagine what it must be like when it's really busy, because it really wasn't when I was here, and was still very frustrating. Our food was mostly cold by the time the bartender finished with our 2 simple margaritas. Would be better served (even if at the expense of the \"authentic\"experience) as a sit-down place."}
{"text":"I'm going to state the obvious here: TYT has solid tacos. I especially like the lengua, though most people I know prefer their al pastor. They also offer soyrizo as a vegan/vegetarian option. I have yet to try their loaded fries or nachos, since I usually come here when I specifically want tacos, but it's only a matter of time. 

However. I really, really dislike their ordering system with different lines for different proteins. I don't care if it's traditional or authentic or whatever, it's inconvenient. If you come here with more than a couple of people, the lines back up and there's no room to queue up. If you want multiple proteins, your order will be cold by the time you're able to eat."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things to like about this place.  Ive only been once so far but I do plan on coming back to try other menu options.  When I was standing in line deciding what to order I saw the cooks making nachos for someone else, they looked good so I decided to order that.  I really like the way they prepare the nachos and really melting the cheese good.  Not too many toppings, really only cheese, beans (Black or Pinto), choice of meats, pico, sour cream, and guacamole...but the guacamole is really good and they gave me a huge amount of it.  They also have a salsa bar with lots of salsas to choose from, and even some beans and vegetables.  The price was great, less than 7 bucks.  I like that everything is being made fresh right in front of you.  You can watch them make the taco shells from scratch.  I really want to go back and try those tacos, they looked really really yummy.  It was good food, good service, a clean place so nothing really to complain about.  At the same time I wasn't blown away by anything either so 4 stars sounds about right."}
{"text":"Poorly put together food. The cooks have become rather arrogant & comfortable with the way food is being served;meaning half-ass burnt chicken (pollo),and almost frozen [ice cold watery]salsa to aid in cooling down the so called entree which in turn makes your taco utterly disgusting AND cold! I have been a supporting consumer for years at Taco Y Taco but I must say that today was bittersweet as it was my final goodbye to this place. 
P.S. The women hosts are very pleasant and remain humble. Of that,one can appreciate! Adios amigos"}
{"text":"My first trip to Taco y Taco was 2 days ago at the Pecos location. I decided to try out their new location today. So you know it's good.

Had an al pastor and shrimp burrito because I wanted to get crazy. The meat is so tender and juicy, the burrito fillings all hit the right spots and they melt the cheese on the tortilla before making the burrito. It's great. 

If you don't know any better you'd be confused by the ordering system, as there are different stations for different items. I'm sure they'll figure out a better way to do this, but there's not just not one big line, there's a crowd of ravenous humans grouped up trying to figure out which meat or taco station they're supposed to be at so they can fill their fat faces. 

The salsa bar, which houses 7 or 8 different sauces/salsas, is great. I'm a sauce kind of guy. I like to try many different salsas on my meal, so thank you for saucing me up. The salsa bar also houses cucumbers, pickled carrot/jalapeños, but my favorite part is the fact they have their grilled onions and jalapeños refilled here instead of ordering behind the counter.

Last but not least I also had elote which is the mexican street style corn on the cob, mayo, cotija cheese and chili pepper. I don't think I would come here and not order that. Although the other location when I went had the white corn(which I prefer), this location had yellow corn, but good nonetheless.

This location also has a bar. 
Aesthetically, this location could use some work, as I'm not sure what they're going for. By no means does it look bad, just needs work and nothing that can't easily be fixed. Ultimately, I don't go to places because they look cool, it's all about the food and Taco y Taco delivers. 

May take a nap."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Heard what's in a breakfast burrito (choice of meat, fries, and cheese?) did not sound healthy so I decided to go for the bowl. I got carnesada with pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole, Spanish rice, and black beans. Loved how they had a salsa bar with all these condiments! My fav! I will have to try this place out for taco Tuesday's. Also they let you taste all the different types of meat"}
{"text":"Nice option for This side of town. There aren't too many decent Mexican restaurants on the south side of lv so this is a nice treat. The Al pastor tacos come with pineapple, pico de gallo,  and their avocado sauce...I was pretty surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. The carne asada was great and so was the chicken. They have a ton of meat options and also offer a vegan and vegetarian menu including soyrizo! The staff was helpful it being our first time at their counter and offered samples for anything we wanted to try. Salsa bar has nice options too! When I don't feel like making my own tacos, they are definitely my go to shop"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here and very disappointed!! They had NO salsa bar, no one ordering food but it took about 10 min to have some one come and ask what i wanted. The counters were dirty like they caught something on fire and the ambers blew on to them. Ordered 3 Carne Asada Tacos and a Carne Asada burrito. Also chips and guacamole. It was $4.15 for chips and guacamole and it wasn't worth it. The chips were hard, stale and the guacamole was flavorless. The Carne Asada tasted like it wAs cooked with fish! Awful!! I was in love with the Carne Asada but now i have to rethink it. Customer service was not great all they cared about is sitting watching tv or talking about what there plans were in Spanish. Not satisfied!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food in town. My husband and I have wanted to try it for awhile but I was always a little scared because every review kept saying how different it was and I'm a bit of a picky eater. But OMG its freaking amazing. Get the Al Pastor, whatever style you want, but definitely chose the Al Pastor as your meat. We've been here twice now and have loved it both times. It's very clean, staff is very friendly and accommodating, food is amazing and they have a great salsa bar. What else can you really ask for?"}
{"text":"This will be the fanciest, street-style, taqueria you'll ever come across... oh did I mention great tasting as well?! Being a new Vegas resident coming from growing up in California, finding a solid taqueria with great food and prices that don't rip you off is hard to come by in Las Vegas. I've tried many but the only place here in Vegas that remains consistent in taste and doesn't hurt my wallet is Taco y Taco. The beautiful interior design is just a plus, and surprisingly enough, prices are great! 

Their Al Pastor is my FAVE. The rest of their meats are great with tender and flavor too, but if you're a Taco noob and wanna try something other than basic carne asada (their carne asada is amazing too), you must get their al Pastor. Whenever I come in the workers are very nice with a hospitable sense of humor and the place is well kept and clean! Love Taco y Taco!!!"}
{"text":"I have seen good and bad reviews, and for those who are conflicted as to why there are such varying scores, I hope to clarify. The meat and other items are super fresh, under-seasoned and appear to be health conscious like Stephanie A. said. The service is fast and friendly (even more if you speak spanish) and the salsa bar is huge. Here is the main issue, they lack seasoning all around. I first thought this was an issue, but then I realized...Its about the SALSAS! They are amazing and provide a myriad of flavor that the tender fresh meat supports. If you want street fresh healthy food with SALSA as the star, go to Taco y Taco. If you want salty or more flavorful meats I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch. My first time I almost walked out because there's no instruction on how they operate their lines. Also all the lines run into the other so you never know who is in what line. It's also SUPER loud so you can't hear what the cooks are saying to you. There's been a couple of times when I've missed heard the cook and they roll their eyes at me EVERY SINGLE TIME!  I believe in bad days and don't take it personally so I came back 2 more times and it has been the same way everytime. The food has no taste. The first time I just thought it was because it was fresh and not processed, well no their food just absolutely has NO taste. I say save your money and go to a taco truck. Even a run down taco truck would be better than this place."}
{"text":"Food is bad, the guys making the tacos are even worse. The one guy insults every single customer and makes you feel stupid meanwhile making minimum wage making tacos. Seriously stay away from this place unless you like bad service and shitty employees. I went there yesterday and got my normal chicharrone tacos and they were out of the meaty pieces, the two guys making them after I walked backed up to replace the tacos with something else cause they had 0 meat from lunch rush hour they told me \"no ! It's always been that way\" I said no it has not, I come here with my co workers often since they like it, he then got crazy on me. Shitty service and not to mention dirty as hell and gross."}
{"text":"I think this was one of the fancier Taco Y Taco's I've been to LOL. Everything was clean, there were couches to sit on, and there was even a second floor. I really liked how there was so much space, so I didn't feel cramped as I walked around compared to the other location.

However, there was one cashier that was really infuriating. My dad was telling her what we ordered, but I think there was a miscommunication and so we were double charged. I just showed her the receipt and the food we ordered, so we could get a refund. She rolled her eyes and snatched the receipt. I was super offended by her.

But otherwise the food itself is great! I always get the carne asada fries (which were perfectly crisp) and the lengua tacos. Besides that woman, I loved this place."}
{"text":"Great authentic food in a hip modern atmosphere. Staff is super chill and funny. Prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It is a very simple little cafe. It is like chipotle but more authentic. Simple burritos or bowls but very good. My co-workers and I go a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Y'all. I can't even with this place. The tacos are so good. The way you order is confusing. Makes no sense. Really, it's bad. But the food. Oh. My. Gaawwddd. It's amazing. I'm from Texas. I know good tacos. These, my friends, are good tacos. It's a melody of music in my mouth. I want to stand and clap after every bite. I'm not crying. You're crying. Damn these are good. If this taco fell on the ground, you bet your bottom I would lick it off the floor. It would be worth it. I ordered al pastor, pollo, and barbacoa. So. Good. I'm going to go back to eating now. May god bless you and my god bless Taco Y Taco."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is one of my go to favorites for tacos.  I usually get the lengua, tripas, and the always-delicious al pastor tacos.  That's it! Keep it simple.  Make sure to ask them to have the tripas extra extra crispy for that crunch that will immediately leave you wanting more.

Unfortunately, I do not know what has become of their burritos.  It used to a lot larger than it is today.  There are pictures here that show how large they used to be compared to what I have been getting from this location in recent times.  It used to be jam packed with favor and ingredients and now sometimes all I get out of a bite is layers of tortilla.  Save yourself the disappointment of a burrito and get the tacos!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about Taco Y Taco, I just flash back to those radio ads on 96.7 back in the day LOL.

This two-story taco heaven is one of my favorite taco joints in Las Vegas and it sucks that it's so far from where I live! To order, figure out which type of meat you'd like and line up under the corresponding sign. After you're done ordering, just go up to the cashier to pay.

My go to order is ALWAYS going to be Al Pastor tacos with everything on it (mexican-style pork tacos w/ cilantro, onions, + pineapples). If you've never had pineapples on your pork tacos, it's never too late. The sweetness of the fruit balances so well with the slight spice from the pork.

I recently craved elotes, so I decided to split one with my friend. Unfortunately we both felt like there was something missing from the flavor, so I wouldn't recommend it unless the crave is real. The same goes for the horchata since for some reason I always go back feeling like it tastes different compared to the last time I had their horchata. Either way, it still satisfies my random horchata cravings!

Don't forget to grab some sides and vegetables at the sauce bar. My go-to sauces are the guacamole sauce (non-spicy) and habañero (spicy) to mix it up between the tacos.

Even though the music is blasting, I like to head to the second floor to eat with my friends since people usually don't know that it exists. There is a happy hour from 5-7pm Sunday-Friday for $3 draft, $4 drinks, and $5 food/wine specials!

Overall, I'd give Taco Y Taco a 4.5... But I'm feelin' nice today. :)"}
{"text":"Man this place is so damn good.. \"Made me wanna slap my momma\"!!! 
lol.. Really though! I have been to a few taco spots in my day from L.A. street tacos off Pico, Whittier, East L.A... even found some gems in the Bay Area.. but hands down.. this is definitely one of the best spots I found in Vegas, if not anywhere. The Al Pastor tacos are BANGING and the Carne Asada Vampiros will do amazing things to your taste buds. All ingredients are fresh, made to order. Staff is awesome and the salsa bar is well stocked with a good variety of sides and flavors. Casual atmosphere with great music, great food, and affordable prices. A must try for all you taco-heads out there!

{"text":"GO HERE! Just do it! I stumbled across Taco Y Taco while in Vegas for a business trip - it's my go to place every time I'm there now. I'm a post Californian, living in the Seattle area now and I haven't run into such good, inexpensive Mexican as I have here. Just GO!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Food was good but it's very confusing! When you walk in you see a bunch of signs for the different meats. We stood in the middle of the room a little confused of where to start. The service is ok. Some stations the people working are nicer than others. I took a star off for the rude cashier and being snotty explaining how this works. It's also VERY loud! The biggest downside is if you want different meats your food is cold by the time you actually eat."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming our favorite fast food place. If we want a sit down full service experience, then it is Lindo Michocan. If it is fast food, then forget taco bell, del taco or chipotle, it is Taco y Taco. It  has a variety of meats and styles of  street foods that you would see in Mexico, at a reasonable price. Well we return? Of course it is close to the house and GOOD!"}
{"text":"Tried a variety of items here.  The ones that stood out were the chorizo nachos and the Pork Tacos.  Add a Carte Blanca beer to that and that's about as good as it gets.  The selling point here is the salsa bar with many varieties.  The Salsa verde is the best I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Tacos!!!  Have tried it all and the tacos are amazing.  Must try their corn on the cob, aka Elotes!  Try the elotes with everything on it.  Salsas are great as well.  
Friendly staff and tasty food."}
{"text":"Overall, I give it 4 because I wasn't absolutely in love with everything we ate, but if you order the al pastor tacos and Mexican street style corn on the cob (aka elote) 5 stars all the way!!! On a whim I ordered the mole fries with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries and chicken. Loved the fries, but the chicken was a little dry, so if I order them again I would either try another meat or skip the protein all together. Mariachi Monday (6-7pm) was a nice treat but be prepared not to be able to have a conversation. I will definitely be coming back! What a great treat to have near Henderson!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great Mexican street food.   Somewhat quirky ordering system, but very manageable once you get the hang of it.  Large menu and everything is made to order.  I especially like the tacos with carne asada or al pastor.   The bar is also a nice touch. It's tiny, but the bartenders are friendly and creative.  And they know tequila!   

Recommended."}
{"text":"Okay here's the just of it! And it's not good at all! Yes they have excellent food but at a fucked up price! Not that they are expensive at all!! But they look at white people like we have a sign  on are head like we are danm idiots to pay $1.00 for a to go box after i ordered 4 tacos a quesadilla to go!!?? First of all im Spaniard and im very fluent in spanish so hear the employees talking shit about your comment you can only imagine how i felt! very angry! i asked yo speak to the manager that was just there moments ago b4 i asked oh he's gone!! i said no it was a female ! oh she's gone too!! im telling you (public)  i will never return after the way they have treated me and my family! and i am a latina cohld you imagine how many others there treating like shit that don't understand the language? not right that they try to ripp the public off!! oh and do not dare saying that they got a order wrong. they will make you pay for there mistake!"}
{"text":"We finally visited this place for the first time the other day. It had been on my list literally since it opened. This is the spot that used to be another restaurant, and they did rather little to the interior and decor to alter it.

For first timers, the setup can be quite confusing. There is no signage or formed lines/barricades directing you (like at Cafe Rio or somewhere). And that left us frazzled and complaining from the start. Some rope and an \"order here\" sign would go a long way.

So here's how it works: There are 4 areas. One for al pastor, one for a bunch of other meats, one for carne asada, and one for nachos and all other items (in that order, from left to right). Approach what you want and order. Slide down with your tray and keep ordering until you are done and/or reach the cashier. You can get each meat as a taco, a mula, a vampiro, or a couple of other ways. Mulas and vampiros are essentially meat between two tortillas with cheese and other toppings. Mula = soft. Vampiro = crunchy.

Once we figured it out, after approaching the cashier and asking, we got in one of the lines, received a tray, and began placing our order. We had, honestly, never heard of mula or vampiro, so we had to have those explained to us - which was simply showing us a picture. Not particularly helpful, but we felt adventurous. We opted for an al pastor mula and al pastor vampiro. We then proceeded to order the mole fries - sweet potato fries with chicken, cheese, and mole sauce.

The mula and vampiro were good and reasonably priced. The al pastor was quite tasty and seasoned perfectly with loads of flavor. The mole fries were expensive and a left down. You got a lot of them, but they totally lacked flavor.

We also got an order of just chips so we could try out their salsa bar. They had several different salsas and all were tasty. The habanero was easily my favorite. None of the \"hot\" salsas were actually all that spicy.

All in all, it was an a-ok meal and experience. I think now that we know the process and what everything is, we will have a better experience if we return. In short, the al pastor was super tasty and authentic. The ambiance and experience was lacking."}
{"text":"So we went to this location for a celebration, we rented the upstairs area, and it was for a private event. The venue itself is a decent size, and we were having issues from the very beginning. Note- it was so hectic, i couldn't get any pictures! From the time my sisters got there, they had another event, so the original time of being able to decorate the food, was pushed back an hour. They claimed to have called my sister and let her Know in a voicemail. They never did. So we had to tell our guests to meet st 8, instead of 7. We got text to come at 7:30, complimentary chips and salsa for the inconvenience.... the catering package INCLUDES salsa, they only threw chips in. Then when we arrive, no one was available to help with the dinner. The steam tables were too hot, so we had issues opening the aluminum tops off the table, since no tongs or oven mits were provided. I went downstairs, and the restaurant itself was PACKED, so the food MUST BE GOOD! And I asked the cashiers, (1 on register, 1 with - tablet) if there was anyone available to assist us upstairs, and they said no....... so I was like, \"ok? So can you give me some serving utensils for the salsas for the food? My guests are using plastic spoons to serve themselves the salsas, the sauces, and grabbing the tortilla chips with their hands.\" (I am a catering manager. This is MY job, I know what to expect.) the cashier was so rude; she had NO clue what I wanted, she said they had nothing, what type of restaurant replies with there are NO serving utensils for salsas? And she brought me bulk cutlery SOUP SPOONS! So- naturally I'm aggravated and ask her, \"wait, you don't have backup utensils like what u have at this salsa bar?\" And she said, \"NO.\"  ok.... so she walks me with upstairs to complain to the actual person who was supposed to be helping us, but was on the tablet ringing people up to tell her this wasn't even her job, to tell me AGAIN, use the plastic spoons... (just imagine; per health code, if a foreign object were to fall in ur salsa; sauce, any food for that matter, it's considered contaminated)..... my baby sister who is 17, and a sweet person, tries to relieve me by asking her and the stupid cashier lady gives my baby sister an attitude- so bad she made her cry! So the lady comes around back all pissed off and showing it, with serving spoons, TO NOT EVEN LEAVE THE DAMN Spoons! She just came to huff and puff around us! We didn't get refills like they said, we ran out of tortillas, and the food wasn't even that good! The manager spoke to my sister, apologized, and gave her a discount. The experience you offer someone throwing a party should be decent, and your guests shouldn't have to worry about the tiny things! This place sucked! I wouldn't recommend my friends to rent this place out! I could have done a better job doing some food in my backyard! It's true what they say, 1 bad apple will ruin them all, that cashier they had was terrible! She ruined our night!!!"}
{"text":"Great \"street\" tacos. Pollo, Carnitas, Al Pastor...all great. Fresh homemade corn tortillas (of course). I even had a Mexican Coke - with pure cane sugar - none of that high fructose corn syrup poison American soft drinks have. 

Mole Fries were super. Sweet potato fries with Pollo, mole, cheese. Wow. 

Just watch out: easy to order and eat way too much."}
{"text":"Ehh... Foodwise, this place is okay.  But they're trying to be something I don't like.  They want to be a trendy place.  That's not what I want in a restaurant.

Upon entering, you're welcomed by one of the most confusing ordering set-ups ever.  You can't go to one person and order everything.  If you want tacos, go to the taco guy, burritos at the burrito guy, etc.  On top of that, the signage is terrible and confusing.  It's a terrible set-up.

Once you get your food and sit down, holding a conversation with others is nearly impossible.  They play techno and dance music at a volume where it makes it difficult to understand those with you.  Why do we need blaring techno?  Wouldn't some soft jazz or even quiet mariachi be more reasonable?  After all, this is a Mexican restaurant, not a night club.

The food was average at best.  There was nothing that stands out.  And no matter what anyone else says, it's NOT authentic. If you want authentic Mexican at a good price, check one of the Los Tacos locations. Real Mexican food in a nice atmosphere at a reasonable price.

As long as they keep their current concept, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Being that it was my first time here I, like most people was hit with confused stick! If you happen to go when it's packed and there are a hundred people standing around in a crowd in front of all the lines you might not know what to do. But when there's no one, it's kind of easy to make sense of it all. 

Ok here's how it works so there are 3 main lines but basically it's like one big line where you get to choose from a list of different meats in different style in each like. You let the guys know how much of what you want and how you want it. For instance the 1st line served up Alpastor right off of the spinner in a taco, tostada or vampiro style. The 2nd line has your more unique choices like chicharron chili or tripas (my favorite) and the 3rd line us your Asada, carnitas etc. and the main 4th line has everything you want to order, burritos, Asada fries, nachos quesadilla, Elote and more. 

They also have a full bar and on most days a live DJ spinning some top tunes or edm which makes for hanging out and eating great tacos fun and entertaining. There are 2 stories at this locations and a sweet open outdoor patio. The tacos are absolutely worth it. About $2.50 a taco the price can add up quick. Stick to the tacos. They are small and you can't go wrong with any choice of meat. I like the Vampiro style meaning(your choice of meat sandwich in between 2 fried tortilla with melted cheese and mango salsa) it's good but nothing beats the classic little soft corn tortilla with all the toppings. Just the way I like my street tacos with the cilantro, onions and whatever other goodness they top it with. 

I tried the Mole fries with regular not sweet potato fries and it wasn't my favorite I think it was the mole. Not bad just too sweet for me it was weird all around I think. They have this salsa bar with so much to choose from and plus they got cooked whole beans all for free. The chips were in house made chips for sure. They were crunchy, crispy salted and warm. The Elote was ok I lexpected a lot more flavor but it was just slightly sweeten and the mayo, cheese & chili didn't do much. But it was still pretty good. The tacos were all dreaming bomb dot com. Not crazy about the Alpastor Vampiro I got but the meat itself was juicy and fatty and full of flavor. 

Such good tacos such cool atmosphere and now that I know how to order I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. The ordering process is less than ideal but the food is amazing. If you want Mexican but something a little different than the regular...try this place. The mole fries are amazing. Everything is homemade and fresh. Huge draft beer selection. Good for picky kids, too."}
{"text":"Food is good. Their salsas could be better. A recommendation order your specialty items first (nachos, quesadillas, burritos) and your tacos last otherwise you will end up with cold tacos. The checkout should be faster too. By the time I sat down to eat my food was cold."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and amazing \"taqueros\" these guys are cheerful and enjoy what they do! 

Now if they could only work on customer service with their cashiers! Everytime I've gone (about 10 times) their cashiers seem to be uninterested, unfriendly and like they really hate being there.  

It's a really sad situation, being that everything else is really good.  So, if you don't mind someone cashing you out who feels they're doing YOU the customer a favor.. the tacos and other food items here are pretty good!"}
{"text":"First there was Pepe's Tacos, then there was Tacos El Gordo and now there's this!!  Best part is the restaurant being only a block away from where I live so I don't have to drive all the way up north for damn good tacos.  Located at the former Republic Kitchen & Bar establishment along South Eastern Blvd, this is definitely one of the better looking taco shops out there.  I like how the new occupants kept the same floor plan from the old bar and added few Latin modifications to suit their concept.  Plenty of seats downstairs, upstairs and even outside.  

This place has several stations for certain cuts of meats from which you can order any way you desire: taco, burrito, nachos, fries, bowl, and vampiro.  Salsa bar is also impressive with various sides and 8 different sauces!!  Thirsty? They have a full bar and an extensive list of beer on tap or in a bottle.  Happy hour is from 6-8 p.m. daily with live mariachi on Mondays and DJ spinning on weekends.

I always get tacos with cabeza (head), lengua (tough) and chicharron (skin) anywhere I go so I had to try them out from this place.  The first two were quite tasty and really tender.  As far as the chicharron, they actually add crispy pork rinds which was a first since other taquerias normally just serve the taco with soggy pork skins.  What also got me hyped up is the fact that they have elotes since I no longer have to track down this dude who sells them from a shopping cart!!

Overall, Taco Y Taco is one of the best Mexican joints in the valley.  I would give them six stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The wait in line is fucking ridiculous. They let people order from the bar and skip all the people that have been waiting in line"}
{"text":"Great little taco spot. They have a solid happy hour, nice little bar, and good beer. My girls love this place and it's always at the top of the list when I ask where they want to go."}
{"text":"I was shorted food on a large order for my daughters birthday party. I called Taco Y Taco upon discovering the shortage. They told me I would have to drive back to the restaurant to get the food that was missing, when I told them that I was unable to do that they said I was to far away for them to bring me the food so they took my cell # and name and promised me a 16 dollar credit upon my next visit. I come in today to redeem that credit only to find out they DON'T DO STORE CREDIT!!! So I was lied to just to get me off the phone the day of the mess up. Over 16 dollars they have LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER!! Make sure your orders are right or they will screw you as well."}
{"text":"This place is completely different from any taco place ive been to. I love how you are able to creat the taco of ur dreams by adding the ingredients you want. I got a steak taco and a vampiro. Steak tacos were great, meat was nice, tender and juicy. They also have mexican Corn on the Cobb which is awesome!!! Portions are kinda small but then again thats why its not expensive. They serve alcohol and even have a happy hour. This place is pretty wide and open, plenty of seating & its two floors. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm good. This was my second time here in 3 days so that must say something. The food is delicious the al pastor is perfect! Not greasy full of flavor and they add pineapple which I love! I've had the pastor on tacos, nachos and in a burrito and it did not fail me. FYI they don't put pineapple on the nachos or burritos but I'm sure if you asked it could be added. I've also tried the carne asada and pollo tacos which were equally as tasty. They have a great salsa bar with not only various salsas but beans, onions and other accompaniments for your meal. Make sure to try the light green sauce Im not sure what it is exactly but it's like an avocado sour cream or something and it's soooo good. Just get a big boat of it and thank me later. 

The reason I took off a star is because the ordering system is confusing. There are different stations for different things like one station is just for al pastor tacos and there is another station for carne asada or chicken tacos and another station for burritos/nachos/bowls etc. Also there is usually only one guy running the burrito/nacho/bowl station so the line can get a little backed up as they prepare everything to order. I waited about 10 minutes for a burrito as the lady in front of me ordered 3 nachos and a burrito.... Now I wouldn't normally mind waiting but the tacos I got from a different station were getting cold. I was tempted to eat them in line. All in all if you like tasty Mexican food you should check this place out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other location on Eastern which is excellent. The good news is the food here is just as good. Very authentic Mexican style street tacos. Lots of variety they have beef, chicken, and everybody's favorite good old El Pastor. So if you're close to the strip and you're craving tacos come down to Tropicana and Pecos. Delicious food, nice atmosphere, great prices."}
{"text":"Eating at Taco Y Taco is a gargantuan battle between quality vs. quantity.  If you prefer quality and you're willing to pay $2.25 for a dinky taco that tastes great but you can finish in two bites (maybe even one), this is your place.  If, however, you reasonably expect to have a full belly after spending $15 on food regardless if it's quality, then skip this place.

Have been there three times.  There probably won't be a fourth time.  The first two times I ordered four carne asada tacos and two chicken tacos, cost over $14.  They tasted great, but were so small I was still very hungry after I was done eating them.  It was like eating an appetizer and then wondering where the main course was.

Went there today for a third time, hoping for more.  Instead I got less.  Ordered the same items as before:  four carne asada tacos and two chicken tacos for $14+.  The carne asada tacos were so small I actually witnessed a co-worker pull the guy making my tacos aside to correct him about how little meat he was putting in the tacos.  Even after he corrected it, I still didn't get much meat.  Then when I went to the counter to pay and they said \"How is everything?\" I said I was disappointed in the amount of meat in my two chicken tacos and showed one to them, and they confirmed that was the proper amount of meat.  Which shocked me as the amount of meat wasn't enough to feed a small bird, let alone a human male.

Sure enough, I got home, ate all six of the tiny excuses for tacos I paid $14+ for, and am still hungry.  Third time I've been three, third time I didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  Even if the food tastes very good.  Doubtful I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is always delicious and affordable. The service is excellent.I have been looking for good Mexican food and finally found one. My boyfriend and I are regulars here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, until my last 2 visits. The food is pretty good, but the restaurant itself is FILTY.  The kitchen was so messy and disorderly. The patio and almost every single table had trays and leftover trash. The trash cans themselves were overflowing. The salsa bar counter was covered with sauce and the bathrooms were horrible. One of the stalls in the ladies bathroom was flooded, the other was covered in used toilet paper and the only working stall was the handicap one and it wouldn't flush properly.  The lack of cleanliness at this restaurant has become so bad, I can only imagine how they prep their food. Never again."}
{"text":"I recently heard about this place having vegan options from somebody's post on a social media group I follow. 
I was in the area today and decided to go there for lunch. I was really hungry so I was hoping that it would be good. 
My first impression as I stepped inside was that this is a pretty authentic place, I always  enjoy the  pickled carrots and onion, radishes, and authentic salsa bar . 
There was a strong smell of meat inside which at first made me a little queasy, but I asked the cashier where I go to order vegan options and she told me line 4. So I went over there and told the lady I'm vegan and asked her for some suggestions. I got one cactus taco and one mushroom taco. The lady making my tacos told me she was vegan, too, &  we talked about that a little bit while she made my tacos. 
I got a tamarind drink as well, my total bill was about seven dollars. Not bad at all for two tacos and a drink. 
I sat down at a table and ate my food. Both tacos were delicious! But I think I like the mushroom one a little bit better. 
Also, the guacamole here is delicious. 
It was nice and clean inside so I hung out for a little while and got some shelter from the crazy 110° weather outside. 
I will definitely be back here for tacos again! I also noticed they have veggie nachos, and I'd also like to try their bowls."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. It's refreshing to eat real Mexican food. Very clean, friendly staff, a bit pricey. I love it, but I feel weird paying 2.25 for a street taco. I usually order 6, so that's a lot of money for a quick lunch. I still visit every couple of weeks. If it was cheaper I would go few times a week."}
{"text":"This place is a train wreck!  The lines they have you stand in are a joke.  Wait in one line, then another, then another and even another.  No structure.  I have eaten here a few times and the food is ok if you are fortunate enough to eat while its hot.  I wont come back now because the last time I was there, they were out of chicken at 6pm on a Sunday.  Waited in line for no reason.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm out here in vegas working from out of town I happen to get lost and found this diamond in the rough.. first trip had a burrito of al pastor and it was very flavorful and inexpensive.. this time I bought tacos to take the different meats. Well all 6 tacos tasted GREAT! only thing is they were a bit pricey but I guess the flavor is worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful and delicious food!!! Salsas tastes like my mom's. The al pastor is perfect. They have the street corn that so yummy. The employees are very kind and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"hi I've been to this location a couple times during the day, awesome service, very clean. But today was the first time I've been here at night and it was completely different, horrible customer service, was really dirty and the food was not up to par didn't feel like the same place I go to eat lunch. 
It was the first time i took my girl here I was talking it up. made me feel really stupid I was saying it was better than tacos Gordo because of the great service during the day time hours I could not find a clean table to sit down ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"It is perfect. Food. Service. Just wow. This is my new favorite Italian restaurant. If you haven't been you absolutely need to go."}
{"text":"Love the soyrizo burritos! Generous portion. Full of flavor."}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and had to try it out! Walking in I had no idea it would be as big of a restaurant as it is. The people taking your order & making food were nice and helpful. I ordered carna asada & al pastor tacos (which had pineapple). Both were amazing!!! Very fresh and very flavorful! I enjoyed my visit and will defiantly check out the location on Eastern."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is authentic, fresh, flavorful & quality!! Service is excellent! And the restaurant is very nice, spacious and clean. Good music & great vibe. Tacos are my favorite. If you want Mexican food in Vegas come here without a doubt."}
{"text":"Great food. I just moved down the street,it's a stop for my family at least once a week."}
{"text":"Holy mother of Mexican food! You have not had GOOD Mexican food until you have had Taco y Taco! 

Came here on rec of a fellow Yelper (and an Elite at that) and she was 100% right- this place is like crack! You're greeted when you open the door by a line of cooks preparing their own fresh tortillas, and the sizzle of flat top grills charring veggies and meats for your taco, burrito or nachos. Their menu is small- doing a few things but doing them all right- tacos,  burritos, nachos, bowls and Mexican corn. However,  their diverse selection of meats and salsas is what makes this place amazing. 

I ordered the good old stand by- gran chicken taco- and picked up a real Mexican coke- yum! The fresh salsa bar had 6 types of salsas plus the standard carrots, cucumbers and green onions. I spied another customer's nachos in line to pay and decided instantly what I will order on my return visit. This place is what real taco lovers want in authentic tacos and the like- as opposed to the Americanized versions with drive thrus...

Thanks,  Taco y Taco, I shall return again and again!"}
{"text":"There are no words.... Just go....so good. El Pastor burrito is the best thing I've found"}
{"text":"Came here from Silverton Lodge based on Yelp. Arrived 15 minutes before opening only to discover they really open an hour later. What a joke. I depend on this site to provide accurate information on regards to local establishments all over the country. This situation is the first of its kind for me. Oh well."}
{"text":"Taco Taco is amazing. From the Al Pastor and Chorizo Tacos to the Nachos and Vampiro. Nothing has been disappointing so far. All of the tacos run about 2 bucks, very affordable and even the small Nachos running around 6 bucks is a steal. You get a mountain of them! I am officially making Taco Taco my favorite taco spot!"}
{"text":"This place is great, or at least the food is!  It is kind of a mess to order and can get pretty pricey, especially with how much I eat and how small their tacos are (I know they're street tacos...).  The flavors are amazing though and all of the free sides you can pick up to go on and around your food just adds to the greatness.  I want to go back and try everything on their menu and definitely will some day, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The ordering process was extremely disorganized. By the time I got through the line and paid, my tacos were cold. The employees behind the counter can't even hear you because it's way too loud. The food is sub-par, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service for NYE.  Under staffed. They had one man behind the counter for all three taco lines. Very unorganized. I had ton stand in line twice. It took 30 mins to have my order to go. A pastor burrito and two pastor tacos. I will definitely think twice about recommending and or dining there again. The holiday hours are open until 7pm and the staff seemed ready to go at 6:20pm when I walked in. They should have much better customer service considering there are so many more choices in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Ah so delicious. If you're looking for street tacos in a modern vibe restaurant- come here! We just moved here and went three times in the first two weeks we were there. Everything was delicious. I normally only eat chicken but the pastor was amazing.. Also- the Mexican corn was so delicious!"}
{"text":"2.25 for a taco. Not bad. Left when i saw they were 1/3rd the actual taco. Snack sized tacos.

Place near my house sells 3x the size for 2.70"}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos!! Coming from east LA I've had my share of some kick ass tacos and these rank right up there with the best! Tortillas are made fresh from a ball of masa as you order!! Meat is clean and flavorful!! Tacos come with all the fixings or you can fix them yourself at the salsa bar!! Best taco place in vegas hands down!! Ordering is a bit confusing at first but provides personal attention to your order as the different stations provide different meats and sides!!  Ponle Sal."}
{"text":"First things first. This place has some of the best tacos ever. Generally fast service. Amazing heat. Chopped to order meat. Even a gringo menu for those less adventurous. Overall it's a great meal and reasonably priced. 

That out of the way, what the actual feck is going on with the bar and the cashiers? Every time I order a beer the ladies at the register look like I'm speaking Mandarin. They ask the bartender. They never key in the right thing. It's a mess. Tonight I read the name of a beer off of the \"todays drafts\" list and the bartender looked like I asked for his dead puppy. They didn't have that beer. That was listed on the list of today's beers. 

I really love the food here. It's seriously a place I bring every visitor. This is my taco happy place. But y'all need to get your stuff together on the cash register and bar side. Make the overall experience as good as the food."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some tacos. The prices match most local taco trucks. There's lots of room at this location so it doesn't feel to packed. 

Although the live band isn't the best choice to have a tleast not the one that was playing tonight. The amount of profanity wasn't exactly inviting. I have 3 kids and I was a bit in shock when they started screaming F#ck. we will definitely be back for more. 

The corn is a must to get! Way better than Roberto's I'm glad they stay open later on the weekends!! Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because their flavor can be a bit better.  Having moved from LA, it's hard to find quality and flavor close to the restaurants there, and even Santee Alley, but Taco y Taco does come close!  They could also work on their customer service and smile more.  For a commercial spot, they're not bad at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack after driving by a million times and yes it is pretty dang good. Ordering is similar to Gordos, where there are certain stations for each kind of meat, but not nearly as busy--at least not when we went. We decided to share an al pastor burrito, and it had a pretty generous amount of meat. It came with a choice of type of rice and type of beans.

Salsa bar was in the seating area and had lots of choices. They even put out the two types of beans there so I guess you could really fill up on beans if you wanted to. And there were several kinds of onions too, grilled, raw, pickled, etc.

Would love to come back and try the cabeza and lengua. The only minus was the AC really wasn't working well."}
{"text":"As a first timer to Taco Y Taco, I must say I am quite impressed. 
The food was authentic street style tacos served quickly, inexpensively and courteously. 
The restaurant is clean and efficient and also serves beer for those who'd like a cold one with their authentic Mexican fare.
All around I would suggest Taco Y Taco to a friend and plan to visit again.
If Ericka Z. gave it 5 Stars, then it must be worthy!
And \"No\", I don't care if they take Apple Pay or if there is a PokeStop anywhere nearby."}
{"text":"We love this place. We live in Summerlin but we make the drive about once a week to eat here. The food is awesome. We ate there this afternoon about 3 pm because they advertised $1 carnitas & al pastor tacos. When we were done eating I looked at the receipt and saw a $100 service charge added to our $28 bill. I took it to the cashier who got a manager. They looked for my signed receipt but couldn't find it. That seems fishy to me; it had only been about 15 minutes since we paid and the receipts were all in a rubber band in the cash register. Somehow mine, with the extra $100 tip, is missing?  The manager didn't seem clear on how to fix it but said he did so I'll wait and see what comes through my account tomorrow. He technically said \"sorry\" but it didn't seem like a real apology to me. I realized on the way home that they also overcharged us for the carnitas tacos. 3/$5.50 is not $1/each. It's only $2.50 but they should know what their specials are and charge appropriately.  We'll most likely eat here again because we love the tacos, but I'll only pay cash from now on."}
{"text":"All of their meats are amazing. Love the vampiro---crunchy, cheesy. Great selection of beers on draft."}
{"text":"We checked this place out a few weeks ago after hearing all the hype and thought it was just fair.  We got a few different tacos and the nachos that were good, but nothing special.  I would pass on this place for other Mexican joints in the area.  It was also super loud with the band and really interrupted our dinner."}
{"text":"Great Al Pastor tacos :)   After trying multiple things on the menu, my family and I have pretty much settled on these!  The pork is tender and spicy, and the fresh pineapple cools off everything perfectly!  It's nice also to be able to sit inside a nice, clean environment and eat great Mexican street food.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try something new over my favorite place to go get a salad (cafe rio)

I had heard wonderful things about this place so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.

It was a Tuesday afternoon around 2:30 pm when we walked in. We had never been before and a lady immediately addressed us and asked if she could be of assistance. She explained how everything worked and then we got into our designated lines to order. 
We waited for 5 minutes before I asked her if anyone would be taking my order. She looked at me and told me the gentleman (who was on a phone call) would be able to help me when he was done.
I was a bit confused because her and 2 other people were standing around. He then got of the phone call 5 minutes later and apologized about the wait.

I wasn't sure if I wanted a chicken or carne bowl so he allowed me to try the meat.
I decided to go with the Carne bowl. Lettuce, white cilantro rice, bell peppers and onion, pico de gallo and pinto beans. 
My boyfriend got a Carne burrito. They were going to charge us $1.25 for a small container of guacamole but I think the gentleman just let it slide due to us having to wait.

We then went up to the second floor to eat. This was nice, however I would recommend placing a drink machine with utensils and maybe a small salsa bar up there as well. (we had to walk down to get refills and needed utensils)

We then bit into out food...
That has to be the worst carne I have ever eaten in my entire life!
It was so extremely salty that it made the whole meal unenjoyable. My boyfriend said the same for his burrito. 
I literally got a headache from how salty the food was about 2 hours later after leaving.

the 2 meals plus a drink were around $19.00 but honestly not worth it.
I don't think I will be trying this place out again."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! Would recommend the chicken, carne asada, or pastor tacos. The Mexican street corn was so tasty as was the steak nachos. Definitely an awesome place for lunch and the cost makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"Quick style food joint. The ordering process was not the best. I needed a moment to figure it all out so he skipped me. I basically had to wave him down to come back to me. For this, I have not gone back, but thinking about giving it another shot. Further, when I ordered the vegetarian option it was as if I were breaking some code. I actually thought it was awesome that they have cactus which is a wonderful vegetarian option. It took some time to prepare, but once I got my vegetarian taco, it was delicious. The chips were thick style homemade but extremely greasy. The guacamole was awesome! I'd give it an overall 3.5, mainly for service."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Slightly more expensive than my usual taco place but the extra cost covers the nice, clean facility. Definitely worth the visit for slightly upscale facility and slightly upscale tacos. Will go back to try more soon. Only 4 stars because they seemed to take a while to get 4 tacos prepared and didn't put the same guacamole on all tacos. 2 tacos got actual guacamole and 2 tacos got a light green sauce the call avocado sauce. Also, the menu lists all the foods improperly. It lists tripas (intestine) as beef as well as other non beef choices. Maybe they think gringos don't understand Espanol"}
{"text":"Don't get my 3 Star rating wrong, the food here is very good.  Everything is super fresh, but it is not what you or I would expect when ordering a normal taco or burrito from a Mexican Taco Shop.  It reminds me of a healthy taco shop.  You can tell that their tortillas are made with health rather than taste in mind, (you can also see  through them).  I don't know about you, but when I go to order a burrito I know it's not great for me. I just want to indulge in the moment of my deliciousness and feel bad about it after.  

** Salsa Bar ** - Somewhat okay, had 3-4 choices. None of them were spicy though. That bugs, big time.

-In conclusion: If you want the \"expected\" flavors of Mexican cuisine, please just go to your local Taco Shop down the road.  This place is good, but not that place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. 
Owned by the same people as Tacos El Gordo with a fraction of the crowds. 
Similar premise, though the lay out is a bit different. 
Grab a tray and head to the station that has your preferred fillings, be it cabeza, tripa, lenqua, barbacoa, etc. Tell the guy behind the counter how many of what you want (1 carnitas y 1 lengua taco por ejemplo), he'll chop it and plate it. Take your goods to the register, grab a drink, and then prepare to load up on salsas!

Seriously. Their salsa bar is STACKED! Dayumn guuurl. 
So much win.
The roasted jalapeños are especially awesome. 

Why not a 5-star rating? My carnitas were just ai'ight. Carnitas are my holy grail of porcine taco/burrito filling and they need to strike the right balance between crispy on the outside and juicy tender insides...these carnitas were a bit on the waterlogged side when I tried them. 

It'd be a 4.65 star rating if I could give partial stars, because everything else was great. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of their other options, like the tortas and burritos!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their service is super friendly and attentive; super clean for a taco joint! Unfortunately, when I got home to eat the food I ordered I found a curly black hair :( GROSS!!!! 
I still recommend this place for its service and reputation. A hair found in food happens to everyone and is something very common. Its not something horrendous like rats! It's a great place but I'm still very disgusted."}
{"text":"Just OK tacos, nothing special, classic Mexican tacos with the same Mexican taco truck ordering process. Food is good but nothing out of the ordinary.
Prices are decent for small tacos but the al pastor was on the salty side.

Definitely not the best tacos in town."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! But it's not what it used to be. The pastor tacos used to be shaved right off the hunk of meat nice and thin. Tonight they scooped up a bunch of chunks that were already cut off. The corn used to be amazing. Now it's just water logged and dried out. I used to love this place but no longer do. There were also multiple dirty tables and the napkin dispenser was dirty and grimy. They forgot where they came from and need to get back to their roots."}
{"text":"Their type of Ordering works in Tijuana Mexico and other parts of Baja, most folks get confused and start cutting in line and it gets really anoying.  They should Stick to Fast Food Style .

Food is Great especially the AL Pastor con trompo (shawarma ala mexican) the TRIPAS and BUCHE also are great Mystery Meats for the adventurous American folks that have Ventured out of the Hamburger World.

Carne Asada and Carnitas (steak and pulled pork) this are great choices, of meats if your on the vegetarian side, The seasonal grilled Veggies are great too.  Must Try the STREET SYLE CORN ON THE COBB. 
(Elote Preparado)

If you are worried about price, if you are o a tight budget, Stay away from ordering Tacos , they are a Rip Off ,they are small and Add up quick.

My Fave is the Burrito or BOWL.

why 3 Stars only???
The Place could be Cleaner and some of the Cashiers are Rude.
I took a picture of the wonderful Booth where we sat with DUCKTAPE.

Management needs to fix these detais."}
{"text":"If you like al pastor, get in your car and drive here now. 

While this location is notably smaller and less bougie than the Eastern one, it is 100% just as delicious. The ordering system goes like this: locate the protein you want, and stand in that line. The al pastor street tacos are  heaven, I like extra pineapple on mine.  I noticed after ordering that they had nachos and I need-not-want to try al pastor nachos. 

Corn, nachos, and vegetarian items are available at the far end counter. I didn't get the elote, but I've had it at their other store and it's spot on. Happy Hour is every day from 5-7, and has some great items - including the $5 chicken nachos. Best nachos in Vegas folks, I'm calling it right now. They are loaded with whatever toppings you want, and it's not just a couple pieces of chicken thrown on top, they LOAD them up. 

I love that they have an escabeche and salsa bar, their creamy tomatillo sauce is delicious. 

Our meal of an al pastor vampire, 4 tacos, and order of nachos, a fountain drink and a beer was around $25."}
{"text":"Good food, the meat was flavorful and the tacos were delicious! Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! This is the REAL DEAL for street tacos. Just GO!"}
{"text":"There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is the BEST location to get your street taco fix and more! This place is over achieving in every aspect. The inside is so nicely decorated you wouldn't find any other casual Mexican eatery like it! They have open seating everywhere, even a second floor or outside on a patio. 
As for their food, I've only so far tried their tacos and carne asada fries which were both fantastic. They have so many options atleast 8 and more that it can be overwhelming when ordering. Ofcourse, Al Pastor is a must SO DELICIOUS. Another favorite I recommend is their CHICHARON TACO! Along with the pork meat they include pork rind chips as a topping! They are so generous with their servings you're guaranteed a messy overstuffed flavored filled taco. They also have a self serve sauce bar annnnnd HAPPY HOUR! Which is 5-7pm and again 11-2am for their food and drinks! I can't rave enough about this place, its not overpriced at all, you get what you pay for and more in my opinion! Recommended for EVERYONE"}
{"text":"Want to have authentic street tacos, as good as those you can find on the best corner in LA? This place delivers!
Only been in LV for 1 month and have already been back a dozen times.  Needless to say, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! IMO, better than Tacos El Gordo - my old go to taco spot. This specific location is great too. It's in a really nice shopping center and the decor inside is neat. Totally looks like a bar or lounge rather than a taco restaurant. 

By far, I've tried two different meats for the tacos. The al pastor and tripas. I also tried both on flour and corn tortilla. I'm more of a flour tortilla person so my preference still lies there. Between the two meats, the tripas is probably my favorite. I like the al pastor but honestly think it's a little overrated. I also asked for everything BUT pineapples both times I went but somehow still ended up with pineapples on top. Meh. The tripas was amazing. If you get it, ask them to deep fry it a little. It comes out so crunchy and adds way more texture (since tripe has such a weird bite to begin with). 

I also had the mexican style corn. Yum yum yum! They make it right in front of you so you could ask for extra stuff if ya want. I like mine super cheesy! My friends also got the mole fries and al pastor fries. I wasn't a fan of the mole fries. The sauce was already sweet... drenched over sweet potato fries made it a bit too much. The al pastor fries were decent as well. Fries were chunky but a little soggy - probably because it was drenched in meat and other sauces. They were good but I probably would never order them for myself.

Another reason I love this place is the availability of seating! The place is huge! There's a seating area upstairs that accomodated myself and 8 other friends. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Great good and service.  Way better then Tacos El Gordo.  The only problem is that they're way too far from my house, but worth the drive"}
{"text":"Woohoo! Great spot for tacos, place is clean and spacious. Take out or dine-on you have to order at the counter. The cooks are quick and efficient and most everything is oh so tasty!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected! The hype was real for Taco Y Taco and honestly I prefer several different but similar places for numerous reasons. When you first walk in you are at a cafeteria style counter where they make your food and put it on a tray for you to bring to the register. You have to go to different spots at the counter to order different things. This is probably my least favorite set-up for ordering in any restaurant I have been to, tacos or otherwise. Having never been there myself, if I hadn't had a regular customer of theirs with me, I could see myself being very confused. 

After you get past the counter, the atmosphere is decent with large open windows and ample seating. Their horchata is to die for; I will give them that! It was probably the best I have tasted anywhere. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, a gran taco, and Mexican street style corn. For nearly seven dollars I expected the quesadilla to come loaded, but it only had meat and cheese. The taco was good, and corn was bomb.com. This is just a preference thing, but the tortillas were not greasy at all, and I want greasy tortilla when I eat Mexican deliciousness. 

My final verdict is that if I were on this side of town already, I would stop by for a horchata and Mexican street corn snack but I wouldn't drive down here to eat like some people I know. My boyfriend says this place has the best lengua in town, and he will make a special trip for it. So I am sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this spot!  Crave it on a weekly basis.  There is one other taco shop that I think tastes excellent here in vegas. However this one is super clean, especially in the kitchen.  There's also a good amount of food options.  

I love the carnitas tacos with flour tortillas and everything on it.   Very generous with the meat.  No burned or tough meat.  Cooked tender and yummy!  

Nachos are big and good for my boyfriend and I to share.   Perfect ratio of toppings to chips. Plenty of cheese!  

The corn!!!!   Mayo, cheese, seasoning!  Must order.  

Quesadillas were too cheesy for me. Will ask for less next time. Their generosity is a quality I do appreciate though. 

Everyone appreciated a bar... Drink away!  Would like to take advantage of the live entertainment sometime. 

The music plays loud.  I enjoy the variety. At times I find myself speaking loudly to overcome the volume.  And necessary to step outside to take a phone call."}
{"text":"Taco y taco is one of my favorite taco places. They have the adobada that comes on the spit. You can order the basics like carne asada and carnitas. Feeling adventurous? They have tripas (intestines) get them extra crispy for that crunch and they will fry them again for you before the put them in the taco. With the adobada get it with everything including the pineapple you wont regret it. I order 3-5 depending how hungry I am. The tacos may seem small but they are pretty filling. 

Also if you haven't tried the Mexican corn. You have to! So good! I'm not sure if they give you the cup option here but either way you can use a knife and cut it off the Cobb if you don't want to get it stuck in your teeth."}
{"text":"Tacos are decent.  They have DJ playing on Saturdays and I'm assuming other days of the week as well.  The ordering system is a little confusing with different lines when ordering specific tacos and a separate line ordering burritos.  Also a different line when paying your overall meal.  Overall, not a bad place when you have a crave for some street tacos."}
{"text":"K I tried to love this place but it has terrible deafening acoustics, the food is spicy but carne Asada was flavorless. Idk how spicy Mexican food can be bland but they manage. Ran out of corn. Long disorganized lines. One dude cooking most of the meat while other workers idled. Weird line set up. Basically, this place is an annoying noisy place to eat.  Not inclined to leave bad reviews but c'mon management, make this a good experience."}
{"text":"Food: Probably one of the best burritos I've ever tasted. Tried their soyrizo burrito, and it was fantastic. 

Decor: The place was nice and clean. Salsa bar and tables were tidy, although there wasn't many patrons there when I ate there.

Service: The employees were helpful in letting me know which station to order at. The cashier was nice and fast too."}
{"text":"Okay, Taco Y Taco wins. Gets better and better every time I go. The fresh salsa bar is just so impressive, too. Last time I went there were 8 different fresh salsas - all delicious as well (not like Rubio's?) and the hot bean bar and pickled sides bar that I want to keep all to myself!

Yes, the carnitas, pibil, lengua, al pastor, and asada tacos are all my favorites. But the true star at Taco Y Taco is their salsa, bean, and pickle bar. This magic bar is clearly made with love and care, and people are discovering it.

You may never go back to Tacos El Gordo or Los Tacos again after you see the Taco Y Taco light. That's what happened to me!"}
{"text":"I just had the pork tacos that were on the spit and their house beer. \

House beer was whatever... 
pork tacos had this cinnamon maybe mole flavor?

not bad and I liked how their salsa bar also included beans

next time i want to try their happy hour which seems like it will be a good deal!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. When you walk in it is very clean and has a really nice decor. They have different stations for meats burritos, etc. 

I tried several tacos the carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor. The best was the carne asada. We got a side of chips and guac which were plain and it turned brown pretty fast. We obviously had to try the street corn. I don't even like corn and it was sooooo good. cheesy and a little spice YUM YUM! 


There really isn't anything to comment about the service because they don't really wait on you after you leave the food stations. It is also pretty nice that they have a bar there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker about 1 week ago. I had never been. The place does have a large seating area which is nice. The food was good but overpriced in my opinion. $2.25 per taco which is the size of a street taco, so small. The elote was good but the fountain drink was overpriced too.
It's safe to say I won't be returning. 

This was my total.
2 Tacos $4.50
1 Elote $3.15
1 Soda $2.75
Tax $0.86

Total: $11.26

Too much for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is not cheap, but it is quality, authentic food. Everything has been very good and it is fresh!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas (Henderson to be exact) and I've already been here FOUR times. So many good restaurants to choose from but I keep coming back.

Ordering process is a little confusing at first. Basically they have stations for the tacos (according to meat) and a separate station for burrito/salad/chips. Their pork (pastor) is bomb as well as the rest of their meats. Definitely a fan of their burritos but tacos for variety. Also, try their shrimp!

Definitely one of my favorite places to dine and already a regular here."}
{"text":"Why are all these delicious taco eateries popping up with incredibly confusing ordering styles? Although this Taco Y Taco is surprisingly large and comfortable I walked in and felt like an idiot! There are four different lines depending on what you want to order, I guess? However, the lines are not orderly which makes it easy for people to mistakenly order ahead of you. It felt like the person who got to order was not next in line but the next person who got the cooks attention. 

I had a quesadilla here and it was good, but not amazing. I like the quesadilla at Frijoles more, to be honest."}
{"text":"This was a one & done one trip for us. Went last night (Monday). Service below mediocre. Ordered a veg bowl off the menu board. They were out of black beans. I was asked if I wanted veggies.  Maybe my bowl type wasn't heard? When paying for my order, no smiles, no thanks, but a yawn. I took it to go.  Saw trash on the floor and tables, salsa bar needing cleaning up. I live real close and food was barely warm. There are so many great places near here, unfortunately they don't rate."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with the family and have had great experiences both times.  When you walk in, the restaurant gives you a homey feel with couches and chairs, along with the standard tables for you to lounge and eat your meal.  Big screen tvs show the latest sporting event and a full service bar is available for those who wish to endulge.  A rep is there to greet newcomers to explain how the ordering works.  There are three different lines, depending on what you want - tacos, burritos, bowls or which meat you are interested in - al pastor, asada, etc...  Cooks carve your meat selection and assemble your order in front of you.  A salsa bar is available with a variety of salsas and pickled vegetables.  The taste is very authentic and flavorful.  Definitely worth returning!"}
{"text":"This is my new Burrito Palace! I happened by one day last week with my daughter and we were both in for a BIG surprise. 

Taco y Taco was a little overwhelming when we walked in the door because it was kind of confusing. You don't sit down at a table and wait for someone to take your order. They have several walk-up stations where you place your order. (I can live with that since the food was EXTREMELY tasty and made to order). 

The process was easy, pick your meat ... beef, chicken, pork and then decide if you want a taco, burrito, etc. I love the hand-made tortillas! The food was fresh and hot. My daughter had the Al Pastor tacos (pork) with everything (pineapple, onion and cilantro and a super burrito - just the way I like it :) We also tried the Elotes (Mexican street corn) - yummy!

They offer smashed avocado AND guacamole!That's a nice touch for people who love avocado but don't want the extra seasonings that come in guacamole.  I have to agree with Robin G and Richard C about the cashier. The young lady who rang up our order was upset with another staffer and didn't hesitate to argue a bit with him right in front of us. The cooks at the station were really nice. I'm happy to find a tasty restaurant that stays open past 10 pm. I'll be back! I talked about Taco y Taco on my morning show Sizzle.Vegas - You'll find the review at 5:30 on the timeline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rfs9mLR-Yg"}
{"text":"After eating at all the taco trucks, el gordo. Tijuana tacos... The only thing special about this place is the salsa bar. Their al pastor sucks."}
{"text":"I obviously have to go back...like tomorrow.  Yes it was that good. Granted I got there at 10:30 PM and was starving but if it was just ok, I'd say so.  I had a chicken, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos.  Each one I ate I said...I like this one best.  Their habanero hot salsa was HOT (thank you...finally I find a good hot sauce that doesn't come out of a jar).  And their tomatillo salsa was mild but not bland.  Service was great, prices great, ambiance cool (I think I might hang out there late night on weekends when I have nothing else to do.) 

And yes the ordering is a little weird but I've found a lot of places that become legendary usually have some quirks.  Get over it...learn your first time like I did by asking questions and owning that feeling of being an idiot. And then enjoy the BEST tacos I've had in Vegas bar none."}
{"text":"I have heard from my brother over the last couple months how great this place was and finally decided to try it.  I will start with saying that the food was okay.  Everyone keeps talking about how it's \"authentic\" Mexican food.  If authentic Mexican food is just cooked meat, then yes, that's correct.  But there is nothing special about it.  There was meat and salsa on small tortillas and one burnt tostada shell.  That's it.  Granted, I could have probably had them add other stuff to this, but unfortunately, as you have read in the other reviews, you have to stand in line for everything you want and that includes just wanting a little cheese.  After 5 minutes of the guy building some nachos and discussing family member and how great the restaurant was, I gave up and decided to forego the cheese.  Seriously, is this a challenge to see how many lines you can force me to stand in before I just give up?  They really need to read these reviews and make some adjustments or they are going to be like half the other restaurants on Eastern and be gone within a few months."}
{"text":"Crazy loud fun unusual authentic taco place of the Gods.  Literally my last Vegas meal before flying home, and walked in to live Mariachi band that were as perfect as you can get.  Little confusing cafeteria style ordering area with different stations for different tacos and sides, they need to setup a flowing single line to make that flow better and eliminate the confusion.  With that said, who can complain about fresh homemade corn tortillas and endless real Mexican meat choices from chicken to beef to pork to fresh garnishes of fresh lettuce onions cilantro etc.  Was sorry was in a rush as I have to go back to try the roasted corn, quesadillas etc.  My al pastor  tacos were delicious as was the amazing salsa bar with endless choices to dress your taco with.  Not the best I have had but pretty good."}
{"text":"I love coming here the tacos are the best !
The staff are so fun and outgoing.
Never had a problem once I waited for a whole for fish tacos and I was not charge because I waited like 15 minutes for two tacos ! So I guess I was happy 
But other than that the meat is alway fresh."}
{"text":"Imagine if the people at Tacos El Gordo told you how it worked. That's Taco Taco. Staff is very approachable despite having to scream over the radio. You can enjoy all the best parts of animals either smothered in cheese or in a taco. My favorite meats are lengua and cabeza. If you can't take it, look away when they cut your lengua out of the taste buds. Talk about a close connection to the food source. If they ask you what you want on it say EVERYTHING. I highly recommend the special, the VAMPIRO, it's like a taco sandwich between two burnt tortilla chips. I also recommend a mula. It's so cheesy and greasy. I usually eat two or three things. The salsa bar is a must pit stop. I personally load up on the green stuff. Lots of seating so don't sweat."}
{"text":"I love it here. If you know what to order and how to order (which I think is the MOST important) then you're in good shape. I've had their al pastor nachos, carne asada burrito, street corn, and their breakfast chorizo burrito. I love their salsa bar as well as the fact that it has both black and pinto beans at no additional charge. No, the workers are not the friendliest, but if you've ever been here during peak times, you'd kind of understand why they don't bother chatting it up, they have tacos to move!"}
{"text":"This is a local hidden jewel with amazing Al Pastor, which I order as a street taco. The street corn is fabulous and pretty much everything served here is low cost and high quality. If you're a horchata fan, there version is decent."}
{"text":"Really fresh food and friendly staff :) I recommend trying the carne asada fries and grand taco"}
{"text":"Amazing! The service, the food, and the atmosphere were all impressive!  We stopped by around lunch time on Sunday; we were quickly helped and the employees were pleasant and informative. The place was spotless and if I didn't already mention it, the food was amazing! I will definitely be back, a lot!"}
{"text":"Flavors are excellent but the organization of the restaurant absolutely detracts from the food. By the time we figured it all out and sat down, all of our food was cold and mushy. 

Also, with meats and fish this good, please stop putting so much sauce on things. You develop wonderful flavors, and then throw sauce all over them. It's like buying a Rembrandt painting and allowing a 3-year old to \"decorate\" it. 

Same for mole fries. Great sweet potato fries but with way too much mole sauce and cheese. It would have been the same as putting cheese and sauce on a wet paper towel. 

Service was hit or miss. Pork guy was nice, burrito/vegetarian guy was not, bartender was nice. 

Good for a quick bite but not a comfortable spot to eat slowly. And DO NOT DO TAKEOUT. IT'LL CERTAINLY BE COLD."}
{"text":"I have only had the beef and the chicken tacos from here because they are so good I haven't been able to change it up yet.  Super friendly service, amazing salsa bar and a wonderful vegitarian menu.  Go east side!  This place is a treasure!"}
{"text":"Yum yum! This place has me addicted to Al Pastor. I wish it was closer to my house. From lengua to carnitas, every type of meat I have put in my street tacos has been delicious. 

The restaurant itself is large and always clean. It is great place to grab a quick lunch. The first time I came here, I did have to have my friend explain the different lines to me as I was quite confused."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Las Vegas. Make sure to also try the corn on the cob."}
{"text":"Love this place! The elote corn is buttery, cheesy, spicy and definitely a mess but so delicious. The tacos are flavorful, the meat is soft and tender, this stuff is legit and the service is friendly and the staff are interactive with the customers. Love, love, love! Always on the list of stops when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. And I lived in So Cal for 9 years. So that makes me an authority on the subject. I tried chicken, carnitas and al pastor. I think my fav was the carnitas. I was planning on one. But I had to go back for two more! I never do that. I just couldn't help myself. There's a salsa verde in the salsa bar that's amazing too. It's the medium lightest green one. There are three green ones, and no names on them. But I think the darkest one is regular salsa verde, the next is a cilantro lime verde, and the lightest is a cilantro cream dressing. That middle one is INSANE on all tacos. Ahhh I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First off I'm mad, I'm mad that l had lived in the area for almost 7 years, moved away to another part of town, and now there are more restaurants in this area going up.  I am MAD. haha.  So I knew there were 2 new taco spots in the area and I wanted to try both of them. 

When I first pulled up I thought, oh cool a nice little corner shop.  After I parked and walked over to the corner shop I saw the other half of the business and thought, YES! It has a big dining area and multiple stations but when I came in on a Thursday night there was no customers except me and another customer it might be a sign. Anyways I just tried them because it looked nice enough and I was already here. As with every business I first venture to I must explore the menu before ordering, trying to remember things I can include in the review, I must've looked a little curious because one of the girl workers, I think she was a hostess, approached me and we started having a friendly conversation.  I don't remember what we talked about but it eventually ended up with me getting a plate of meat samples, SCORE, and ordering some lengua tacos, I'm sure I must have said \"How's the tongue?\" and \"I would like some tongue\" in our conversation, not \"I want some beef tongue tacos.\"

I went with two tacos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-taco-mexican-eatery-las-vegas?select=YjOw4JLUEZ36X9O5BYS6hw#G6-xTt9g3-Q3DAQ_84_c7w  The al pastor and lengua tacos, both were delicious. The al pastor meat was layers upon layers of awesome tasting pork meat cooking in it's own juice with other spices on a spit.  Request for the meat in the middle or lower section of the spit, a lot more juicier and not as dried up as the top.  The top section is still good too it's crispy and pineapple tasting.  Once in the tortilla it was topped with onion, cilantro, pieces of pineapple, and a green sauce.  The lengua meat was tender and topped with onion, cilantro, and a green salsa.  

I'm a sauce guy and I love that there's various sauces and complimentary ingredients you can add to even enhance my food. Hook it up with some of that habanero sauce please. Their condiments bar have everything from grilled, or was it fried, green onions and peppers, various sauces/salsas, limes, radish, and carrots. I might be forgetting a few other items. This might be my favorite place because they variety on their menu.  I mean you can select from tacos, burritos, bowls, nachos, fries, etc.  There's like 12 different meats you can put.  If you're vegetarian, they have something for you.  I wonder if they sell alcohol, if they do I'M NEVER GONNA LEAVE. I'd hang out here cause they also have a TV and those various Vegas Weekly and Seven magazines, which I always pick up and look through.

The customer service here was awesome.  Very friendly and their ordering system is easy to follow.  You're not going to get overwhelmed here or seem hurried.  They have a bell hanging on the wall that I think you're suppose to ring if you liked it, GO crazy and ring the damn bell if you like it.

They're located in the North East corner of Pecos and Tropicana, where there's a Bank of America.  It shares the same building as BOA but on the North, opposite end, of the building.  There's a few nice shops between BOA and TT, just make up an excuse that you have to stop at the bank then come here before or after. Also at night the area is well light outside and it's not in a bad area.  They have a website that you can order from, nice flyers, and a nice interior so it seems like some money has been put into the business.

Oh yea it's just a bus ride out from UNLV or if your in the Tropicana or Pecos route.

And they now serve beer!!!

And during lunch it gets busy."}
{"text":"Finally there's a place serving good street tacos south of Tropicana Ave to bad it's not on the West.

Well I gave the original location a 5 star cause I loved it so Im gonna give this location an extra star cause I love it even more. Yes an extra star, 6 stars, so what its a 5 star rating system. When they decide to open one near me I'll probably give them another star too LOL. It's the same awesome food as the original location, maybe a few more options on the menu, but in a larger, fancier, and better place.

There's lots of meat choices. If you're having trouble selecting which meat you want just ask they'll gladly explain or let you sample, free food sample them all haha. A must is Al Pastor with everything on it and extra pineapple. Al Pastor is a spicy marinated pork that's been roasting on a spit, take it like how they serve it or let them know how you like it, I like a little more crunchy then normal. There's 12 different meats :) I've had them all at the other location but one that I didn't see  was the cochinita pibil so I had to sample it, delicious I need to have it again. The meats can be put in a taco, burrito, bowl, fries, nachos, and as a vampiro then you can go to their condiments area and load up on their various sauces and sides. Warning the sauces aren't labeled but if its like the original location there's a habanero sauce in the mix its probably orange, try them all and buy a drink. Ask for fried green onions and peppers if there aren't any at the condiment area.

There's a vegetarian menu also which you can put in a taco, burrito, bowl, or the other options like the meats. There's the Seta which is a mushroom and chile pasilla mix with queso fresco, the Soyrizo which is a soy chorizo, the Queso Fresco which is a smooth pasteurized cheese, and the Vegetables which is fajita mixed style with green and yellow bell peppers and purple onions. Reading of the menu.

I got the Al Pastor, Lengua (tongue), and Carnintas (shoulder) tacos and even an Al Pastor fries with everything on all of it. Everything was very delicious as I remembered from the original location. 

There's a lot of dining room both downstairs and upstairs, it seems more private upstairs and with a view of downstairs. They serve cocktails and beers. Happy Hour is 6pm-8pm daily, Brunch 11am-3pm Sat and Sun, Live Mariachi 6pm-7pm Mon, and DJ Fri-Sun. I don't know what the deals or menus are but noticed them on a flyer on my way out.

OK I'll comply to the 5 stars rating system for now. Still the best in town just saying."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic tacos! I always get the al pastor, it is packed with flavor! They also have a couple of local beers! In all a great place!"}
{"text":"The only reason I go to Taco y Taco Is because Tacos El Gordo is too far and too packed.

FOOD:  3/5.  Their food looks like Tacos El Gordo, but something is missing.  It's not bad I suppose.  They do have probably the best salsa bar I've ever seen.

SERVICE: 1/5.  Those lines suck and can start arguments amongst patrons.

AMBIENCE:  3/5.  It's a little more elegant than most fast food joints.

Ill check out this place every so often."}
{"text":"Solid taqueria for all of your taco needs. I've only had al pastor and chicken (without onions), but my SO has ordered it all and loves everything. Only bad thing I can say is that one time I went to order al pastor (pregnancy cravings, man!) and they didn't have pineapple! Only happened once, but still not cool. I love the fresh avocado they serve and I like to take limes from the salsa bar and squeeze them onto my tacos. Mmm!

A lot of people come into the restaurant only for the bathroom; enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Everything is so GOOD! Anything Al Pastor is to die for. The line is a little confusing for a first-timer, but I don't even care anymore. Just as long as I can get some tacos and vampiros, I'm good!"}
{"text":"I visited this place while I was in town. First of all, VERY CONFUSING FOR A FIRST TIMER. So basically they have different lines for the different types of food they have e.g. a burrito line, a taco line, etc... My girlfriend and I are vegetarians so we went to the veggie line and we both ordered soyrizo burritos. The burrito size was a bit bigger than chipotle size and we got chips and guac when we paid. It was a big pricey but alright. The soyrizo was a bit spicer than other soyrizos but very tasty! We decided to sit upstairs since downstairs was so packed. I loved the food but I was very confused by the decorations/environment. I feel like the decorations and environment give off a more bar/club vibe that is 21+ only. It doesn't fit in that this place is a family restaurant. I will definitely visit again when in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos made fresh in front of you. Love the cabeza and lengua especially.  The corn on the Cobb might be the best version of corn you'll ever eat. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall it was not a good experience and we felt we wasted our food and dinner time at this place.

Nothing to write home about.  Over priced. Food not good & it was cold.  Everything was too spicy.  My family did not eat more than two bites of their food. We got Fish tacos, lingua, cabeza tacos and chicken quesadilla.  Menu ordering is not clear.  You have to wait in different lines to get different food items.  By the the time you are getting the second and third item from a different line, your first few items are cold already and you have waited more than you'd normally wait in a line to order your food all at the same time!  The nachos chips were greasy.

For the prices they are charging they're serving the food in paper plates and plasticware?!!  Better mex restaurants out there and less expensive.  

Not worth it."}
{"text":"They had a dj playing way too loud.  First time and was confused by the ordering process,  the lady explaining was very nice but her accent with the loud music was very hard to understand.  The food was good,  a little expensive for what you got."}
{"text":"So I finally got to try this location (Eastern/Richmar) after eating plenty of times at their other location on Tropicana.  Upon walking in my husband and I thought...\"oh they did a nice job with the remodel inside\"...until we sat down and really got a chance to look around.

We sat facing the stairs (right in front of what appeared to be their booths) so this enabled us to see the upstairs.  The curtain appeared to have fallen off.  The front area looked odd...was it a place where people can eat or is it a sort of lobby/waiting area?  Maybe If the place was packed with people it wouldn't look so empty?  The bar area only seats about 4 people...and we thought it was suppose to be somewhat of a bar/restaurant?  The ambience just didn't fit well with the type of food they serve. 

Now the kitchen...they did a great job with the remodel of the kitchen as the restaurant before did not have all that kitchen equipment.  It started to make more sense to us once we saw the kitchen...as a lot of money went into getting all that equipment so I'm sure the owners just wanted to open the doors to start recouping some of that money.  

Now the food...we were disappointed as it just didn't taste like their other location.  We love the Al Pastor tacos; however, their Al Pastor seemed to be heavily spiced with cinnamon that it over powered even their salsa that they put right on top.  We also had their Barbacoa tacos and the meat was on the chewy side rather than what we're used to with the meat just falling apart easily.  We overheard a lot of new customers confused at where they are suppose to order.  Now I read the other reviews from other yelpers and you'd think they would put up some directions by now as to not upset new customers...but they haven't.  Maybe that will come when they start focusing on the dining areas...

Sorry for the 2 stars...as I do like your tacos (at least the once we had at Tropicana).  I will wait until you all settle in...to try it ince again."}
{"text":"To be fair we have visited this place again and have got a lot better result, while i still don't really know why there is a DJ at times however the food has been really good, everything seems to have come together nicely and we will absolutely be back, the tacos are very good!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I've been a long time customer and I come here often with co workers and have never had an issues. My only complaint is the service. I ordered a corn on the cob which is $3.15 and I asked them to cut it in half for me and they told it was a $2 charge. This absolutely ridiculous. I was asking just to cut in half not to place in a cup or anything tedious. I would also
understand if it was busy but it was not. Plenty of staff. Logically I don't see the $2 charge to cut the corn in half."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. The food is good, always fresh and reasonably priced. It can be a bit loud at times and when it gets busy things seem hectic, but don't let that stop you from going, its worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!  Must try the tacos of Pibil!  Very friendly service!  Not your ordinary taco stand... Modern day taco bar!!"}
{"text":"If you like salt, this place is for you.  I know Mexican cuisine can be salty as it is, but sampling of different tacos, rice, etc we ordered were all on salt overload.  Outside of the salt, taste was amazing!  Good selection of beers and FULL bar.  Ordering as everyone else mentions is confusing at best."}
{"text":"I rate all taco joints against the Mexico City standards. This place by far, comes the closest to the real thing than any other place. Even the famous taco spots in LA don't compare. I can't speak for the other menu items. The tacos are authentic and delicious. The carne asada tacos are cooked over mesquite coals while the other meat offerings are cooked to perfection in a pool of goodness. I recommend the Suadero tacos. You will not find this cut of meat mastered to perfection outside of Mexico City. Good thing this place is so far away from home or else I would be in serious trouble."}
{"text":"Came here excited to try the food and experience this location given the fact that it evolved into quite a few businesses from a seafood restaurant all the way to an Irish pub, but anyhoo, here it goes.

The place looks very nice inside, they have a dj, sitting area, a bar, and an upstairs seating area. I ordered a soy chorizo burrito and a couple of mushroom tacos. Both were meh. They honestly didn't have that much flavor and the portion sized when it came to the burrito were quite stingy. Even Chipotle isn't that stingy, but I don't eat there often anyway. I tried my bf's al pastor tacos which were very good. He had a long island which had no alcohol and was charged $9 (never again). 

Overall, the food was good but not really for most of the portion sizes versus what you pay."}
{"text":"Four Stars... Not for the tacos themselves... But for the SALSA BAR!!! 
I still think TACOS EL GORDO has THE best tacos but this place wasnt bad. 
They have ADOBADA too but I guess it is called AL PASTOR here. I just didnt feel like it was as flavorful at El Gordo.
The salsa bar is the shizzznit though! Nom nom. Like six different kinds of salsa, i could just eat them with a spoon! 
Good prices on everything and they have A LOT more food options like burritos, rice bowls, tacos, corn... My first time having Mexican Style corn too! The corn was cooked perfectly! Crunchy yet sweet, not mushy... As for the flavorings it was MEH. It could have used MORE flavor but I would still order this again just cuz!"}
{"text":"we just moved here from San Diego, and we're happy that we could find some old-school carne asada street tacos - great price, great cantina atmosphere. Tasty tasty tasty fresh and fast! They have all sorts of different tacos, tostadas, burritos - a pretty huge selection of stuff to choose from. Also have beer and a bar, and sometimes, a DJ. Lots of seating (small patio, downstairs indoor and upstairs seating)."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical about trying this place because I kept reading all of the negative reviews about how bad the customer service is, and yada yada but I'm so glad I decided to!!! I Thought the days of enjoying taco shops with my hubby were over, but this place brought me back to taco heaven. On our trips to Vegas my fiancé loves visiting tacos el Gordo, but they aren't veggie friendly so I decided to do some Yelp research on taco shops in the Vegas area and came accross this one. As soon as I seen that they offered vegetarian options and the regular meat tacos both looked bomb I knew I had to try it. Yea the ordering process is a little confusing but we got lucky because nobody else was in line so we just walked right up and the cooks were super helpful, and really funny- cracking jokes with us while we were ordering. My fiancé ordered the lengua, pastor, asada and loved them all. He said they were comparable or even better than that other place I mentioned. I ordered 3 of the soyrizo tacos and they were AMAZING. They don't skimp on the \"meat\" and they were topped with Guac, it really doesn't get any better than that for a vegetarian. They filled me up for sure. Their salsa bar is also ON POINT, I got the creamy green looking one and poured it all over my tacos and they tasted even better. As far as cleanliness of the place, it looked fine to me. I was enjoying my tacos so much everything else didn't even matter to me. As far as the lady at the register, she was fine, I didn't get any bad vibes from her. This is definitely my go-to for tacos whenever I come back to Vegas. Not too far from the strip and just all around worth it. The veggie lover and the meat eater were both 100% satisfied. Now if only they can open a location in SoCal, that would be awesome. Thank you Taco Y Taco for having an option for everyone when most other taco shops could care less. You da real MVP."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and my go to Taco Tuesday spot! They cut the Al Pastor right in front of you. I got the that in a taco & vampiro (hard shell tostada sandwich) along with a carnitas and carne asada taco. You also gotta try the Mexican style corn on the cob...You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Fresh meats cooked right in front of you. The salsas were very delicious as well"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Taco y Taco you are missing out.  Everything about this place is delicious.  It's completely authentic...and you get  LOT OF food for a small amount of money.  I love the salsa bar...and I am a huge fan of the horchata....try it, you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Didn't even bother to order anything. Nothing looked appetizing. Especially the animal parts boiling/floating in a vat of liquid."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Henderson!! huge variety of dishes. Excellent service and great ambience!! You won't be desapointed."}
{"text":"Took the girls basketball team for dinner. We ordered before to get a table and buffet style for the team. The food was amazing and service was great."}
{"text":"This place has really taken a turn for the worst. I remember when this location first opened and everyone was so nice it was lively and fun....not anymore. EXTREMELY disappointed with the customer service here. The lady who rung us up was also working the \"bar\" (the bar has only 5 chairs). She right of the bat had an attitude rolling her eyes and sighing because she had to ring us up. Then this place had NO LIMES what taco place has no freaken limes!! We asked her if she had any limes and she said no and we asked her why and she's rolled her eyes again and rudely said i don't know. What made matters worse is I saw people with beers in the facility that had limes in it. We don't need 100 limes but someone with good customer service would offered 2 or 3 from the bar. Then my boyfriend signed the bill she immediately picked up the receipt looked at it and rolled her eyes again because we didn't tip. Just awful don't waste your time here go to the other location or better yet go to Tacos el Gordo!!! The only reason I gave them even 1 star was the portion size, the guys give you a heaping amount of meat on your tacos!"}
{"text":"Another fantastically authentic hole-in-the-wall kind of place. I never knew you could have a cactus burrito (napoles) but I'm glad TYT was there to introduce me to it. Glass bottle coke is not particularly rare in Mexican fast food joints, but if they have it, it's a good litmus test as to how much effort they put into their business. Also, the el pastor pork was pretty solid."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and I have to say the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was for a couple of little things during the dining process yet overall it was fantastic. What I will say that I loved most was that no matter if your a carnivore like my husband or vegan/ vegetarian such as my self they had tacos, burritos, and anything many options for you. Unlike some places these vegetarian or vegan options only consist or tofu, well thank your lucky stars people....we have finally found a place that serves us real tacos without tofu as the only option!!! There are 4 options actually, one that's a mushroom and grilled onion blend that I tried and loved...it doesn't come topped with cilantro and onions so I added it but, you can add the topping you prefer. Also a grilled veggie, which I also had which is topped with cilantro, onion, Pico, and guacamole, it's absolutely fantastic as well. They had two other options as well but, I don't remember off hand, that I didn't try and will save untill next time. The only reason I dropped a star in this area was because, though my tacos were fantastic and the person making was knowledgeable and helpful. I had no idea what was going on when I first arrived. I literally was waiting in the same line with my husband looking at the three menus trying to compare to see if I just ask them to make mine with those options. I was clueless as to what I was to do at first. The guy behind the meat counter not helping my husband offered me no help what so ever. It wasn't until my husband told me where to order that I finally placed my meal. We also decided on buying chips, though they have some in a pan with a heat lamp and we came on a night when not to busy, we received the ones prepared in the togo box cold and stale. Other than those two things, I highly recommend coming and trying this little street taco place in Henderson, especially if your vegetarian or vegan. Oh by the way my husband says the meat tacos were delicious as well! Recommend the pork over the carne asada though....yet, both were fabulous! On another note so was the salsa bar! Thanks Taco Y Taco!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big carne asada fan just because they mostly, with the exception of a few places,  all taste the same  so I order tripas and al pastor. Hands down the best al pastor and tripas that I've tried here in Vegas, especially the Al pastor. Tripas have always been my favorite but now I think it's met it's match.  Love the fresh salsa bar.  The mole fries were unique but not a big fan of them. They have a beer bar which I think is amazing. All the meat is cooked and cut right in front of you. All fresh ingredients are used as well as the meat and that's another thing besides the flavor of the food that sets Taco y Taco apart from every other Taco shop. Can't get enough of this place! Now maybe we can get one on the Westside huh?"}
{"text":"Overall excellent food. The service and cleanliness cost it a star but otherwise incredible. The people at the food line were incredibly friendly and helpful but once we got to the cashier, we asked if they had any sides (hoping they had corn on the cob), and she said \"just chips.\" We later saw guests with other options so we were a little confused as to why she told us she only had chips. The garbages throughout the entire restaurant were overflowing and pretty gross, but otherwise not horrible for the area as far as cleanliness goes. Tacos were excellent, we got a variety of 6 and shared and wasn't disappointed with any of them. We will probably be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, loud and live. Four stars for food, service was mediocre and the cashier was inattentive. Somewhat confusing how to order from the menus. We still don't know how to order and staff was not very helpful. Salsa bar is good, and we ordered 4 different kinds of tacos and corn on the cob they were all good! Plenty of food for $24"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were good. Salsa bar was nice with 6 different kinds."}
{"text":"The food here is Da Bomb!!!!
We tried all the tacos, they were all great!  My fav was the Al Pastor, the meat was a little crunchy and very flavorful. A must!!!!
The chorizo taco was also slammin!  
They have great micheladas, and an extensive tequila menu. 
Oh, I almost forgot the Mexican corn on the cob, order this!!!!!!  The corn on the cob was so freakin good, great amounts of cheese and spice.  
The best part was our friendly bartender, he was so cool and friendly. I was at the bar alone with him for a bit and he was attentive and knowledgeable about tequila and cocktails. I love great service and friendly servers. They make the meal sometimes. And he made my time at this place memorable. 
This place is gonna be my \"go to\" spot for tacos!"}
{"text":"Delicious !! My boyfriend and I always make it must to stop in and eat when we are in the area. Never been dissapointed. Our favorites are the al pastor and carnitas, they have a great selection of beers as well!!"}
{"text":"I give 5 stars to the food, al pastor, carne asada, the corn!!! barbacoa, the tacos and salsa are some of the best in Vegas.  

I need to take off a star for the lines.  This place is chaotic if it's busy.  The lines all mesh together, first time people have no idea where to stand.  I feel like you gotta work to get your food here."}
{"text":"I love this place, the best al pastor I've found in Henderson/Vegas! Their tacos are delicious & their street corn is amazing! I come here every taco Tuesday for $2 tacos & the fact that they have a bar is what keeps me coming back  friendly staff, confusing ordering but basically you stand in a separate line for different entrees/meats. Never have been let down"}
{"text":"Don't!!! Cater from here!! we got there 15 mins after we requested our food to be ready and then had to wait an additional 30 'mins for our food.. the staff was apologetic but the owner was soo rude and didn't seem to care that I had a party at home waiting for food."}
{"text":"Great concept (no table service here - each person on his/her own). Fast and fresh. Chaotic and confusing.

You get all of that here. There are signs posted above the food stations, but no one directing newbies in how to place an order nor are there distinct lines for people to wait in. If it's busy, you just wait in a lump of people hoping you're not cutting someone off and that you're in the right line. 

Stand behind the sign where you want to order that particular item. If you want to order a carne asada street taco and a burrito, yes, you have to stand and wait in two separate lines.

Besides the chaos, the food service was impressive. They make the food right in front of you on a hot grill. The street corn on a stick was generously buttered and seasoned, and the burritos were as big as Chipotle's. They expedite your order so you don't have to wait too long. The salsa station has a good variety of mild, medium, and hot sauces.

There is plenty of seating throughout. So elbow your way to the front of the line, grab your food, then grab a seat and enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here and would come back. Clean restaurant with plenty of seating. Ordered a couple chicken tacos with everything on them and an Al Pastor taco with everything. To drink I ordered a lime Jarritos. Tacos are quite small but very delicious and cost $2.25 each. I could have eaten 5-6 of them. After you pay, there is a salsa bar where you can get more toppings. I grabbed a few limes, hot sauce and some green creamy sauce hat was great atop the tacos.

Friendly employees who make your tacos fresh in front of your eyes. Proper tacos for a good lunch with friends. 

Muchas Gracias Taco Y Taco, can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The atmosphere was awesome and the service was nice and fast. The food was amazing and the portions were great. They even have a salsa bar with beans, salsa & veggies. The Mexican street corn was good. The highlight was the el pastor meat taco with the pineapple salsa. AMAZING!!! I really look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Its not Tacos El Gordo!! I came to this location twice, first time it was good enough for us not to make the drive to Tacos El Gordo for a fix. But the second time (which was on the same week) just failed. The lady at the burrito area was talking crap in spanish calling us stupid and mentally slow. Now this is all due to a warmed up tortilla that she had to throw away. We ordered two burritos, when she was done making the first i politely asked to change the order to carne asada fries. Thats when she started talking crap and didn't realize i understood her. So everyone was laughing at us and then i ordered two tacos, one seso and one cabeza. The guy tells me just pay your order and ill get it to you. Both tacos smelled rancid and tasted old. I didn't touch it after that. 

Whats really terrible about this is that it all started by that this older lady at the burrito area named Veronica who had to throw away a warmed up tortilla and the fact that it only took a thrown warmed tortilla too intentionally try to give you food poisoning. 

This experience is at the Tropicana location. Well were never coming here again. Unfortunately, we wont even try the other location."}
{"text":"Stopped in during the lunch rush today, and it was packed! Seems word got out pretty quickly. However, the line moves fast, so you don't wait long. You start over on the opposite end of the cash register, order your tacos, move over and order your sides, bowls, etc., then pay. It's a fast and easy system.

Their salsa bar is awesome, with salsas and condiments to fit any taste. My only recommendation would be to put labels somehow on the salsas for those who don't know salsas and accidently dump the wrong kind on their food. For those of us who can tell them apart, you'll be fine.

Their beer taps aren't turned on yet, so if you want beer, they have bottles. You can also get mixed drinks later in the day (their manager said the bartender didn't come in until later).

The tacos are tasty, and if you don't like cilantro, onions and guacamole on them, tell them in advance. I wish they put a little more meat in them, but for $2.25 a taco, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by someone at my doctor's office. They said they had some of the best tacos in town and she was right! Love the pork tacos on the spit. Also had great carne asada tacos as well as many other great choices! Ambience is very different than any traditional Mexican restaurant as it has a modern feel and look to it. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco seems a little more upscale than your ordinary Hispanic food joint and by that I mean, no drive thru, just dine in and it has two floors. The place looked very nice overall, even from the outside. 

I like their food but it doesn't seem any different than if I were to order it from a fast food restaurant. In fact, I think their servings are smaller here and a little more on the pricey side. I'm a fan of al pastor tacos but these were not the best I've had. I would give it a 3/5 for the food. 

I do like that they have a good variety of sauces you can grab yourself to add more flavor to their dishes and the full alcohol bar they offer. Something that other places lack.

The music sets the right aura for the place but was a bit too loud for my taste. I felt like I had to yell a little when talking to my friend sitting across from me. 

I'm willing to give his place another chance only because my brother seems to like coming here but if the experience is the same, I would probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite place for tacos in the las vegas area its in Henderson nevada which is a 15 minute drive from the strip but worth the drive.they have a location by the strip but haven't gone . The cooks are extremly nice attentive and genorous with the meat portions in the tacos. They also offer you to taste a sample if you'd like and the (sazon) seasoning is spectacular. I do not eat spicy so the salsa bar was perfect for me but they do have chiles toreados for those of you with a spicy palet. The atmosphere is great for both children or adults they have a a full bar and patio and dj on friday sat sun and mariachis on mondays and regular music during the week. We are visiting from Texas so we know a good taco when i eat one all in all the place is nice clean good tasting well organized and relaxed thanks had a great dinner with the fam."}
{"text":"Very good!  The tacos al pastor were the best and everything tastes pretty authentic.  The service okay too.  It's nice to have a cart to load up your tacos and this location has a great one.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. Love that it's not as packed as this other popular place in town but maybe because it's not as big yet. Equally great tacos. The only issue is that the taqueros are asleep. Good music too."}
{"text":"We had just arrived in LV following an early morning flight and were happy to see Taco Y Taco was open at 10:30 AM. As others have mentioned the ordering system is certainly unique but once you \"get it\" it's rather straightforward. The counter staff's friendly explanation helped as well. Our order consisted of two burritos (carne asada for me and pollo for my wife, both with the guacamole add-on), chips, and a fountain pop. The burritos were fantastic and well-built; delicious and tender meat, tasty guac, and just the right proportions of ingredients. The chips were also very enjoyable as they were light and crisp without any residual oil. We tried the mild red, tomatillo, hot habanero, and avocado salsas from the self-serve salsa bar, and all of them were tasty with the mild red and avocado being our favorites. Altogether it was a fantastic, fulfilling meal in a friendly and cool atmosphere for less than $26."}
{"text":"Nice and clean inside. Tacos are small..expected more. Corn was delicious."}
{"text":"Two words Pastor taco! This is a must try if you love crushing taco's. The fact that they have beer is a plus. The salsa bar hits the spot. Don't forget to get the elote!
The Mariachi Monday is a bit too loud but entertaining. I sit with the kids while the wife fights through the multiple lines so its a win win for me, all the good food none of the aggravation"}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos!!!! Salsa bar is best I have seen in Las Vegas including beans and veggies! They also have vegetarian tacos! Perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I got the carne asada fries and they were decent. The meat was fresh and juicy but the fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting for awhile. That's disappointing since there were only about 3 or 4 other customers there so they weren't super busy. They have beans at the salsa bar which were pretty bomb though! My friend ordered the tacos and he enjoyed them. 

If you're going to try this place, I say stick with the name and go with the tacos."}
{"text":"AMAZE! So happy there are now two locations in town. Tacos are so juicy, tasty and only fresh ingredients. Soyrizo breakfast burrito is delicious! Carne Asada fries are perfect. Love the hibiscus tea. The veggie and sauce bar is loaded, the best in any mexi restaurant, as long as they keep it stocked LOL Mexi corn scrumdeliumpcious!"}
{"text":"Food is great!! I get a crane asada or a loaded up burrito.  The corn (Mexican style) is so freaking good


The lines are very confusing and chaotic.  Gets frustrating

5 stars food / 3 stars lay out. Literally so annoying."}
{"text":"My husband is crazy about the lengua tacos here and the condiments offered. Clean and organize."}
{"text":"As you have probably heard you MUST try the El Pastor taco, holy crap it's so good! The cafeteria style is lackluster but efficient. I love that they sell pineapple soda, it's my wife's favorite. The Mexican street corn is also very tasty!"}
{"text":"Yum Status!

I just moved to the area so I thought I would check this place out. I was greeted by a lady that explained the whole ordering process since it way my first time and she was very nice and helpful.

But skip to the food...
OMG YUM!!! I was a huge fan of Taco El Gordo and when they shut down the location on the strip I was very sad. BUT, this place to me, is better! It's more fresh and the home made tortillas are delicious. 

Expect me to be a regular. Best tacos EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming a lot and I can't get enough of those tacos! 

It's a great place to go to if you want to eat late at night in Henderson. Their fries, corn, tacos, and burritos are really delicious.

I don't recommend coming here on live Mariachi band night if you like to eat in serene....because it's so loud! I can't hear myself even thinking!"}
{"text":"Best tacos is town. The staff is super nice. If I could live here I would. Lol And the bowls and to die for.

 My parents live out of town but when they get off the plane this is the first and last place they have to eat."}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas and authentic tasting food! Salsa bar is great! Taste of authentic street tacos with a nice , clean restaurant, fun ambiance and great music! Def a new go-to place now. (A little pricier than if expect for tacos but overall good food)"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Taco Y Taco, and would not be the last. Totally love exploring new places and Taco Y Taco had impressed me by their own taco season. Everything is fresh and the best part of this great experience is that you get to see them making your own food!!!!! And the reason why I give them 4 instead of 5 is because it was no tables available to seat down after getting the meal."}
{"text":"The tacos here are pretty delicious! The place is clean and they have a nice ordering fashion goon on! There's different lines for different types of tacos and they're a tad bit on the expensive side about 2.50/taco but I think it's worth it. 

These tacos are like the small street tacos or taco truck sizes. Once you order them, you can walk to a different line to get your toppings like cheese or whatever on it. That line is also for other stuff like nachos, fries or burritos and other stuff. They can definitely hook you up on them fries and nachos! Just a tip, if you want cheese, specify which type because they have like 4 kinda. My husband asked for cheese and they gave him the shredded Kraft Mexican style cheese. I say that because I'm used to getting queso fresco or cojita cheese on my tacos so just be aware :).

Once you're done, they also have a fresh salsa bar as well with a variety of sauces, radishes, limes and fresh veggies like cilantro and onions!!! A do it yourself kinda place is the best place!

All in all, we're coming back for sure because this place is delicious AND it's off the strip!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican taco spot like ever!!!! I lived all over and I just love their variety and the people are so nice !! It's so clean and well designed. I love love lingua and the shrimp tacos .... oh oh and the corn"}
{"text":"Omg this place is delicious! Tacos al pastor all the way! Their salsa bar ! Don't get me started, I love their salsa bar. I hate it when other taco places hog their salsa in the back and make you ask for extra and then give you the tiniest plastic containers! Not here! Open salsa bar for everyone ! Lol their quesadillas are awesome , I wish I lived across the street i'd come here way more!"}
{"text":"Over priced, except for the plain street tacos.,bathroom door always locked and only one of them. What ? I gotta hunt down someone to get the key ? If the neighborhood is that bad of a slum where you have to get security to unlock the one toilet in the place for a guy, then screw it. There are way better , cheaper places to buy a lousy taco. It's ghetto food, not fancy French . Cheaper and better are somewhere else ."}
{"text":"My favorite street tacos.  They are the best tacos in Henderson.  We take all
Our out of town visitors here for a good time and some delicious authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food on the southeast side of town! Nothing fancy, just delicious food!
Love this place. So much to choose from and I would love to try more if I would stop ordering the al Pastor tostadas every time I go. 
Street corn is great, bowls are good. All the meats are tasty whether its in a taco, tostada, vampire and more. They are then topped with fresh salsas that compliment the meat perfectly. 
Their side bar is great! More salsas, black beans, pinto beans, grilled onions & peppers, pickled jalapeno carrots and more at no charge. 
The down side is ordering. You walk up to the counter where there are 3 different lines along with another side counter to order other items. Confusing for those who are new to the place and can be a cluster. 
If you can get past that, great food, great price."}
{"text":"Great little taco joint. Carnitas, Al pastor, pollo, quesadillas... All off the chain. A half dozen salsas, pickled jalapeños, carrots, radishes, grilled onions & peppers, pintos & black beans at the salsa bar. Happy hour 3 Al pastor for $5. 
If you get confused on how to order
 (4 \"stations\" each handling a different item, i.e. Quesadillas, tacos, sopes etc.) just point... Lol
Their staff is friendly & will figure it out.. 

Cold beer & street tacos, life is good. Recommend you stop in, good stuff."}
{"text":"It might just be me, I didn't think that the food was very good.

I got a bowl and my husband got the burrito. If I had to choose, I don't think it was better than Chipotle or Café Rio. The al pastor meat (pork) was unique for sure, but it's not so good that I would go here for it.

On a positive note, they didn't serve the food in Styrofoam containers, there is a fountain drink station, and the veggies were fresh.

I may give this place another chance only due to the fact that I didn't try their most unique items and tried to stay safe, but for just a bowl or or burrito I would just rather eat at Chipotle and plus it would be cheaper."}
{"text":"WORSSSSST.... SERVICE EVER.. so unorganized the lines  are bad I stood in like for 25 mins...got to the line for the burrito ask for a burrito Asada she said they didnt have much cause they have a huge order of idk what..... greaaaaaat. Thanks .......sauce bar completely empty when I got to the cashier asked the girl if they would refill the guac sauce she said they don't have any it's noon so you guys only have one batch of sauce?  I would rather drive down to LV strip tacos el gordo better choice faster liner better quality."}
{"text":"Been here once before and i thought it was a mediocre chipotle wanabe. Just tried the mole fries and this place jumped to the top of my \"best fast mexican food spot\" list. Thank you taco y taco for bringing something completely different!"}
{"text":"Like one reviewer said... its like tacos el gordo and chipotle had a child and named it Tacos y Tacos.

This place is fantastic with my only complaint being that unlike its mother chipotle it does not have ICED TEA!!! Perfect otherwise, great salsa bar with FREE BEANS!!! Extremely fresh and clean yet authentic feel.  Yes the servers speak english but this is a good thing! You dont have to feel like you are in the third world to enjoy great mexican food.  The fish tacos are better than what I used to get in San Quentin when I  lived there in Baja Norte.

UPDATE: Their Eastern location DOES have \"ICED TEA\" but it is not brewed there it is some horrible concoction they bring out in plastic bags.  Again other than the lack of quality Iced T this place is 100% awesome."}
{"text":"I'll come out and say it, it's been gringofied a bit.  I'm going to compare iit to Tacos El Gordo because similar formula.  It has a full bar and beers on tap so it got my fourth star.  Major issue, huge sign at beginning of order line that says al pastor but they were out.  Wtf?  So I ordered the carnitas and tripas.  Tripas were good but not as crunchy as I'd like and are smaller than the tacos at Tacos El Gordo.  The carnitas were boring and texturally not exactly what I want in carnitas.   They do have a salsa bar with various salsas that are good so that edges El Gordo.  Overall, not bad but if I was on this side of town but I'll stick to Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"My current food obsession! I probably come here at least 5 times a week at this point for their carne asada tacos and I usually drench each taco with one sauce cup of their hottest sauce.

The only reason I wouldn't give them a 5 star review is their staff. All the cooks are extremely nice however one and/or some of their cashiers are a bit grouchy. An older, shorter hispanic lady rang me up and didn't even acknowledge me. No eye contact, didn't even verbally give me my total, absolutely nothing but grabbing payment. I tried to ask for sauce lids since it was a to-go order and she immediately walked away. So much animosity as if I ran over her dog when I've never even seen her before. The younger cashiers and the really tall one are great tho! BUT cashiers are always the last impression before a customer leaves.

Anyways, this place gets four stars for their amazing food! :D"}
{"text":"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: I can definitely sink my teeth into their vampiros again but everything we ate had a \"but\".  It was good, but...

THE MEAT: The restaurant space is large and yellow and very clean, greeting you with yummy aromas and shoulder bopping Mexican music.  They have an open kitchen and a veggie/salsa bar too.  We had the large Lengua Taco (the tongue was cooked perfectly, BUT it was bland, and it came with beans and equally bland guacamole so the whole thing was bland), the Nachos with Chorizo (this was good, BUT the guacamole was bland and the nachos itself were fried/very greasy) and finally, the Al Pastor Vampiros (this was VERY good but the meat was a little dry. Still, this was almost perfect, try it with another meat).  I regret not ordering the corn!  We were too full by the time I remembered. Sniff.  Will we go back?  Maybe for the corn and vampiros.

I'M STILL DIGESTING... that bland guac.  It needed onion, tomatoes, acid, salt and a lot of love.

WANT TO SEE SOME FOOD PORN? :-)

{"text":"Review Update:

Taco y Taco is back to its greatness. The al pastor tacos are no longer dripping in fat disgusting grease. 

I come here almost weekly and it's not on purpose either. I always get one carne asada taco and one al pastor. Boyfriend gets two al pastor tacos. And then we share chips and salsa. 

Their elotes are as amazing as people describe them to be."}
{"text":"A great local taco place! The al pastor is flavorful and prepared to order. The restaurant is spacious and nice, compared to Tacos El Gordo. Flavor wise, I would say it's a little under Tacos El Gordo but it is still tasty!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely went downhill. NOT TOO BAD but it sure has. When I first started eating here it was 5 stars since then they raised there prices and I just dont get that wow factor anymore. I still come for taco Tuesdays though lol"}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco could possibly be one of the best taco places in the city. The el pastor is amazing and juicy. If you feel like Frenching the cow, try the lengua tacos (beef tongue); it's tender and delicious. The ordering method is a little confusing but you should get it after your second visit. If you're in the mood for something a little different you can try the Vampiro taco, which consists of two fried corn tortillas with melted cheese and the meat of your choice. It's kind of like a nacho sandwich. Would have EASILY given this place 5 stars but they don't serve ranch."}
{"text":"Is supposed to be fresh make tortillas and what I  have cold tortillas .the cane asada Supposed to be cook at the time of the order And I was cold"}
{"text":"This food was complete crap, I do not understand any of the complimentary reviews on Yelp. First of all, when I walked in, two ladies that came in together were equally as confused as to how to order, their system is very confusing. The service was terrible, the manager, a pretty hispanic woman and the cashier who both spoke English, conversed in Spanish as I waited to pay my bill (HOW FRIGGIN RUDE IS THAT?) I could have easily walked out without paying due to their confusing, unorganized system and had I known how horrble the food was going to be, I probably should have not paid.
Now, for the food, I had an over priced burrito that consisted of  dry and tasteless chicken and the tortilla was not fresh. The portions for 6 dollars is terrible, if I did not purchase nacho chips with this meal, I would have still been hungry. The only good part of my meal was the salsa, they were all tasty.  Then, as I was leaving, there is literature in the entry way telling customers to have an open mind when eating this food and that it is authentic Mexican Food. I have eaten all over the world and this is far from authentic. It is over priced crap food, terrible service and it is rude to speak Spanish in front of customers when you know damn well the customer doesn't understand you. RUDE, RUDE, RUDE, RUDE, I HAVE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THIS STORY AND TO NOT EVER EAT THERE. BY THE WAY, AS I WAS LEAVING, I RAN INTO A FAMILY MEMEBER WHO WORKS AT A HAIR SALON IN THIS STRIP MALL, SHE AGREED THAT THE FOOD WAS CRAP AND NOBODY AT HER SHOP LIKES THE FOOD."}
{"text":"I ordered the al pastor tacos because it is a favorite of mine. The flavor was different than the norm but I loved them. The meat seemed a tad bit too salty but the tasty pineapple salsa balanced it out.  
Service was also nice, salsa bar very extensive and fresh.  I also loved seeing my food prepared.  I can't wait to try everything else on the menu.
Another review I read said the prices were high, they must have changed because the tacos are only $2 now, yay!!!! Great prices, great food, great service, nice atmosphere and music is a good mix. I will probably go back tomorrow for round two."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco never disappoints. The meat is always juicy and tortillas soft. Very authentic street style tacos. There is a large variety of salsa/chile to choose from. 
Also, free frijoles on the side! A bit pricey but worth it. The restaurant is impeccable when it comes to being clean as well!"}
{"text":"Some of the best street mexican food ever. Street style corn and pastor vampiro tacos are legit!"}
{"text":"Yelp told me to go here.  Yelp said I would like it.  Yelp was right.  

First of all the space that housed this restaurant was very clean and very large.  In fact, there was a 2nd floor with more tables that overlook the entire area.  The decor was nice.  The staff greets you when you walk in and the staff behind the counters were also very friendly. 

There were separate aisles or stations if you may call it that where you order your food.  We had the vampiro al pastor which was pretty much pork with all the toppings, sandwiched between two crunchy corn tortillas.   My wife described the taste of the pork as if eating sweet bbq sparerib meat.  I can go with that.  

We also had standard tacos, filled wither either chicken or steak.  While okay on its own, their amazing toppings bar brought the tacos up a few notches.   Imagine Roberto's but with 3 x more stuff.  So many types of hot sauces, grilled onions, beans, etc.   I really liked their options here.

Their carne asada fries were a bit underwhelming and a bit over priced.  That was probably the only miss about this place.

To top it all off, we ordered one of their elotes.  It was seasoned in chili powder, butter, and cheese.  Loved it.

Satisfied with this joint, Taco y taco will be my go to when I want some authentic tasting Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I think i have been to this place about 7 times in the last 3 weeks since i tried it for the first time after reading reviews. I love how fresh everything is, the corn tortillas are handmade in house and are awesome. I use to have to go down to EL GORDOS but now i dont have to travel 20 min to get my taco fix. Thank you Taco y Taco for providing quality food at affordable prices. I will be a frequent customer i promise. I actually met one of the owners the other day when i was there and was able to tell her how much i liked the place. Everything i have tried so far has been great well maybe except the burrito I will prob still go to chipotle for that. The flour tortillas there are just way better. But everything else has been the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome.  The food here was seriously legit.  Loved all the flavors, the salsas and the smells.  I was seriously impressed with the food and cannot wait to go back again and try some different things!

The place was very clean, the staff very helpful and the salsa bar was on point.  Great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"I love their tacos, the burritos are okay, but the tacos are the best! Chicken. Steak. Al pastor. Each one, every time alway great. Whenever I get the chance I try to go. My boyfriend loves their quesadilla. The hibiscus juice is my favorite, they are definitely better than Pepe's. The only thing that Pepe's beat them is they offer pineapple juice along with hibiscus, but other than that this place is great. Good customer service too. The condiments station is pretty good too. I choose this place over taco el gordo because they don't have any long lines and if they do the workers are pretty swift!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the seating available. The decor was also very nice, but the music the DJ played was so loud!!! I couldn't even talk to my boyfriend because he didn't even know what I was saying! Also the ordering is kind of strange too. Even though there was an assembly line set up, the food we ordered took 10 minutes to cook and we didn't know if they were going to bring the food to us or if we had to pick it up because there are no waiters and there were no numbers being given for each meal.... Anyway the food was still delicious. And they have free elote at a certain time everyday or weekday I believe."}
{"text":"If you're a person that loves fries with whatever type of meat, DO NOT GET THEM HERE! I could have made better fries at home. The adobada, pretty good!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the place is a mess.

On Friday through Sunday, there is a live dj blasting any song from the last 5 years. The current dj doesn't stick to a song for more than ten seconds.

I will come back for the fresh meats and veggies, but the dining experience is merely tolerable."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I'd definitely classify this joint as white-people Mexican food. The servers are Latino, but speak English well. Other nationalities other than Latinos eating there. Really clean space. Meat: not too fatty. See, white-people Mexican food! 

Loved their fries; not a soggy one in the bunch. Covered w/ pico de gallo, cheese, guac, & crema, I had to stop myself from eating the entire portion & making myself sick. So sad that guac doesn't hold up well in leftovers *yucky face* 

Order first, pay after you get your food. I got scolded for paying while I was waiting for my food...reason for 3 stars instead of 4. Don't get your panties in a twist, homie. It was my first time here (& it'll probably be my last), cut me some slack. other strikes: i didn't see Orange Bang in the soda machine & carne asada was a bit bland."}
{"text":"I grew up in the dusty plains of Arizona, which while there wasn't much to do, there was at least good tacos that were never more than a stone's throw away. I grew up with good tacos. You think tacos are your ally? I was born in them, molded by them. I didn't see a burger until I was already a man. 

Okay, maybe I exaggerate a bit but you get the idea. After college I moved to NYC for 4 years for work, the food capital of the world right? Yeah! You would be right except there are NO GOOD TACOS IN ALL OF NEW YORK. I am convinced by this fact. I tried everything to no avail, I resigned myself to my fate of eating asian fusion tacos (bulgogi tacos, kimchi tacos, it was good but... you know).

You can imagine when I moved to Vegas I was excited about being close to my home food again, and it didn't take long for me to stumble on this delectable spot. The tacos here are bomb diggity, especially the al pastor and the shrimp, 2 of my favorites. They have authentic chicharonnes as well as chorizo and any other protein options you can think of. They also have delicious mexican street corn! As others have mentioned, the salsa bar is by far and large the biggest draw, just go easy on the roasted jalapenos :) 

The only drawback is its a bit on the expensive side in my opinion. The food quality is outstanding and the service is superb. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area (or even if you're not!)"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the whole vegas Valley people are missing out. Pastor is killer here not to mention i love ther habanero salsa. I live in Henderson i don't mind taking a trip down here for sum tacos."}
{"text":"Cheap, authentic & delicious food!  I thought I was back in LA for a minute!  The street tacos are made to order & $2.25 each. We came on a Thursday around 9:30pm & they had live music, well kind of. It's one guy signing & playing keyboard. Full bar, plenty of seating down or upstairs."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! I love tacos and all Mexican food! There's is delicious! You can pick out whatever you want and it is extremely fast! It is also really fresh!!! It isn't some cheap taco place like Roberto's! It's delicious! I love coming here"}
{"text":"We have driven 30 minutes to eat here, several times. We love(ed) it. 

Two weeks ago we made the drive to take a friend that was visiting to taste their amazing food... Or so we thought. I've NEVER had such a terrible customer service experience with a place, especially when the staff they send to the table tells you their manager is in the wrong! We ordered tacos, street corn and carne asada fries. Everything was great, except the carne asada fries. Now please understand my husband is the type that will eat a wrong or bad meal before complaining, and we aren't the types to ever send food back. But our fries showed up the table NOT COOKED. Literally they were cold, mushy, and white. When's the last time you got served white fries? 

My husband took them back to the counter and asked if they could please remake them. Over 10 minutes later they brought THE SAME box of fries back and this is what the waitress told us... \"I'm sorry, but my manager said this is how are fries are made and they will be the same if we remake them. He said to tell you that we just changed the oil two days ago so even if we cooked them for 30 minutes, they'd still be the same color\". I told her I'm really sorry, but your manager is wrong, and clearly doesn't know what he or she is talking about, and not to mention this is terrible customer service. I told her I wanted new fries or our money back as those were not edible. 

She took them back and about five minutes later a really nice young man walked up. I fully expected him to be the manager, but he was a cashier. He told us he'd get us a refund, apologized for the poor service and agreed we were correct and the manager was wrong! Another ten minutes, a conversation at the cash register about our fries amongst staff and we finally got our money back. I told the nice young man to let his manager know I'd be calling THEIR boss. He very sweetly gave me the number to call and said please do. I've not called yet, but I plan to. I'm a business owner and if one of my staff treated a customer that way, they would be promptly unemployed. While the customer may not always be right, your fries should never be white... Shame shame Taco Y Taco. Not worth the drive to be served undercooked food and treated TERRIBLY"}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere, whenever I have family or friends visit I bring them here for dinner, lots of seating ( 2 floors ) good lighting and great food tons of options on the menu although I always order a gran taco. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"In the non-Yelp world Taco Y Taco deserves a 4+, not 5 stars. However, since 4 stars is the new 3 stars, I guess 5 is the new 4. 

These guys have got it down. While I haven't explored everything in the menu, I can attest to the following all being outstanding;
- Pork tacos
- Chicken Burrito
- Vegetarian Burrito (with that Soy stuff)
- Great sauces
- and much more

Environment is good, not great, but certainly not a hole in the wall. 

Service is speedy and mostly friendly. 

We go at least 2X a month."}
{"text":"I like their new 2nd location in Henderson better. Always lively and packed it seems like. Great handmade Mexican food. I really love the carne asada grand tacos. The nachos are good too but I wish they made homemade chips. They make fresh corn tortillas and that would be perfect"}
{"text":"I've been to the Taco y Taco on Tropicana and the service was great, unfortunately I didn't get the same service here at Eastern location. The men serving the food were great that's why I gave a 3 start. The cashier lady was super rude and impatient with us when we were trying to giver her the money (no one else was in line) and as well we wanted some bean and this other lady gives us a cup. The food was great but still didn't enjoy the customer service..."}
{"text":"If you live or used to live in California, you wouldn't give this place a 4 or 5 stars.. King taco baby!! Hehe.. 
This is probably the nicest and modern taco place I've eaten.. It's a very hip and good place to hang out place.. 
This restaurant is very spacious and wide selection of salsa bar.  But the taco is NOT good .. I have high expectation for this place since reading so many good reviews but disappointed in every way.
I love when taco places marinate their pastor(pork) on the rotating stand but this one have a weird flavor and was wayyy too salty..
Carne Asada taco was bland and cold.. The guy took the already cook beef out of the contianer and just chop it up.. I don't like that, I want my meat to be hot the it suppose to be.
I think the tortillas are housemade, good but too thick.. I won't be coming back here again.. Try it once and never again!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town period!!!! Cool atmosphere and great food. Lots of seating, and a nice bean bar and salsa stand. Great service and food! Best spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco was not my favorite Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to the tacos were small and didn't have a whole lot of taste was my impression I got several types because I wanted to give it a shot and give it a fair shake and the chicken and pork neither of them made me happy about getting tacos there and Tacos in their name I was really excited about going at first because I love me some tacos but unfortunately I would rather go to a local spot like Don tortaco or something else but I'm not going to go out of my way - I wouldn't even go back to Taco Y taco let alone go out of my way. The service was good and I thought that was nice so that's the 2 Star but there was no one in the restaurant and that should have been as sign to me that it'd not great."}
{"text":"I suddenly had a Cabo flashback! Never tried them before this location opened. Amazing food. The place is set up in a cafeteria station style with seating outside and inside with two floors. They have Happy Hour everyday from 6-8pm and a Mariachi Band every Monday 6-7pm. A lot of the staff doesn't speak English well, so that could be a problem for some but what a good way to practice your Spanish! The service was a little slow and disorganized at the counter but the staff was friendly and the bartender Christopher was great and made a great margarita. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the techno music welcomes you into the door. I don't think you can go wrong with anything here but there is s reason the pastor gets its own line. Bomb. Spicy mango salsa and delicious pork. Get the chicharron and you won't be sad. Crunchy and delicious. After my first bite I had to set it down just to savor the flavor. It's super good in case you wondered. Roll in here and get some tacos if you know what's good for you."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and helpful, they have amazing yummy food!! They have a large area for guests, are open late, have several special events each week. Check them out, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"That lengua taco will literally melt in your mouth, while the chorizo explodes like a flavour bomb."}
{"text":"Ok , I had to make a second trip here before I decided to do this review because the first time around I had a Carne Asada bowl. Since they are aptly named Taco Y Taco, this time around I made sure to try their tacos.

So this second time around, me and the wifey decided to try different stuff aside from tacos.  We ordered  2 tacos. 1 Al Pastor and 1 Carnitas. We also got  a Carne Asada Quesadilla and a couple of Elotes.

The Al Pastor Taco was ok. Flavorwise, I have had better. The plus was that they had a little more meat than others. The Carnitas Taco was even better than the pastor. The meat was tender and had good flavor to it. Both tacos were ok. I wasn't really blown away by it. What stood out for me about them was the price. It was 3.50 for just 1 taco while most places sell it for only 2 bucks a pop. I guess that's why they're called Taco Y Taco because it's almost twice as much as other places? :P

The Carne Asada Quesadilla was really good! Besides the good meat and cheese, they put a little bit of guacamole and pico de gallo in there. I asked for sour cream on the side for no extra charge. Now this was worthy of the 5 dollar pricetag they had for it. 

Last but not least, the 2 Elotes we got were pretty good. For 2.25 each, you can get it normal or \"Street Style\" meaning they throw butter and spices on it. If you have ever seen Nacho Libre, those very same Elotes you see in that movie are what you can get here.

Service is decent. You order what you want, grab a tray, and slide on down the counter where they put the finished product on your tray. Since they have employees at different stations, you get your food faster because they can concentrate on those things they are assigned to make.

The place itself is very spacious and can accommodate large groups at a time. Good job on keeping a place this size pretty clean.

Before I go, let me mention the salsa bar they have set up. You have a total of 8 different sauces ranging from pico de gallo, to salsa verde, to extra spicy habanero! Besides that, they have the basic pickled veggies and sauteed peppers/onions that you would find in a fajita. So to me this is another plus because of all the unlimited variety of topping choices you can add to your meal.

So in closing, I would  come back here from time to time, especially for the Elotes because not every Mexican place has them. I just wished they didn't charge so much for 1 little taco. This is what subtracts the 1 star. Still, they get a solid 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I lived in cancun for a year and since coming back, 2 years ago, we haven't been able to find Mexican food comparable to what we had down there-until taco y taco came into our life. The al pastor is EXACTLY like sitting street side in Mexico and not very expensive either. Getting tacos, burritos, and bowls; lots to choose from. All of their ingredients and salsas are really fresh! If I had to choose a quick Mexican dinner, I'd choose here.  

The decor is so clean and modern. There is so much space inside and lots of tables for seating. On Saturdays they have a live DJ which is fun. 

If I had to choose a quick Mexican dinner, I'd choose here"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a couple weeks ago and now I am hooked. Best Carne Asada Nachos in town. Very friendly. Great resturant! Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! You get to try things you won't get anywhere else like cow brain, head, and pig tripe. The tacos are so addicting and I love the line and how you get them. They have an amazing bar for limes and salsas. Amazing happy hour when the beers are $3
Who wouldn't love this place? I know who. People who aren't fun at parties that's who."}
{"text":"Like most reviewers (I now read), I too was confused as how to get my food. There were multiple lines and if you don't know what you're doing, you get lost in the shuffle. I would hope they would read some of these and perhaps have a greeter or at least have the employees say \"Have you been here before?\" and if a customer says no, they can explain what's going on. So, nobody helped me and I stood confused and reading signs, which are mostly in Spanish, trying to figure out what I wanted to eat and how to get it. When I finally did get my turn I was in the wrong line so I had to scoot over two lines and get in the taco line. I got the two carne asada tacos and scooted over to the area to order nachos. The man said the machine they use to make nacho cheese is not working, so even though there is a big pile of yummy looking chips, no nachos today. I took my two lonely tacos over to the cashier, grabbed a fountain beverage cup and paid. I walked around the super crowded dining area only to find many un-bussed tables and a tiny spill on the floor. Walking ever so carefully I found a seat at the end of a long bench that had other patrons on the other side. Needless to say, it better get good real soon. I walked over to get my drink and next to the fountains was a totally full trash can that was so full it was opened with trash hanging out of it. On top of the trash can was more trash, and beer bottles and trays. Just wow. Long story short, the food was SUPER GOOD. The taco meat was so juicy and seasoned so nicely it had an awesome twang to it. The cheese was strong and tasty and the sour cream, so fresh and the perfect addition. Service was terrible. Nobody talked to me, nobody explained anything to me, nobody cleaned the dining room, nobody said goodbye. I will go back and give it another try, some day, I would like to try the nachos because they have a lot of good looking toppings. Maybe their nacho cheese warmer upper will be fixed by then (don't you have an oven or a microwave?) thanks!"}
{"text":"Meh. I ordered two tacos al pastor and an elote. The elote had a decent flavor, but they shouldn't have gone so easy on the toppings. The al pastor didn't have very much flavor, so I was disappointed. 

I'd go again to give this place a chance to redeem itself, but that's about it. 

On a positive note, the place is copacetic and spacious. Nice interior."}
{"text":"Update: my boyfriend and i used to love to come here, not anymore! The woman making our burritos was so beyond rude and acted as if we were an inconvenience to her! Grilled one of our burritos and didnt offer to grill the other... we also got carne asada tacos and normally they come with guacamole but the guy said he was out even though i got some on my burrito.... when we got the cashier the price was way more than we normally pay and we always get the same thing. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 2 years now and it always satisfies me!! I love coming here and inviting my friends to try it out. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants a good Mexican street style taco!"}
{"text":"The location is really good and the ambience is nice, but the food is mediocre. The food truck tacos are better and cheaper. I dont recommend this place."}
{"text":"He tacos here are bomb, there's no doubt about it. However it's on the pricier end of things. They even charge more than king taco in California. 4 star because the interior is always dope and relatively clean. They could use a little training on their customer service if they're a brand. Some of the guys working there can be a bit off putting. Kind of like they don't want you there lol. Other than that, the tacos make it worth dealing with their attitude"}
{"text":"I came here three times in 10 days. That should say something! Not your typical Americanized Mexican-type food. Very authentic, and their carnitas and carne asada grande tacos are fantastic! I also got the carne asada burrito bowl with no rice. The red and green sauce here is far better than many of the other Mexican restaurants I have attended.

The best thing here is that they appreciate individuals who observe lent by offering grilled fish and shrimp in taco, burrito, and bowl form(s)! Their jalapenos are the best! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so decided to check it out. I ordered a chicken burrito, since it's hard to screw up. It wasn't bad but the guy making my burrito didn't put that much chicken in it. For $8.25, I guess I expected a little more. I'll give the place two stars, but that's being generous..."}
{"text":"A fancier Tacos El Gordo! I'm loving the feel of this place. Although I think Tacos El Gordo is pretty darn delicious, this place seems way more sanitary! There's so much to choose from! I'd probably come here over Gordos! It's pretty spacious too! There's even an upstairs you can go to dine. 

Last visit I got -- Corizo taco, carne tostada, and El Pastor taco. My favorite was the Corizo. It had just the right amount of heat to it where I didn't even have to put extra salsa. But of course I did anyways because I  just love the heat! Lol the Carne tostada was my least favorite. The crunch the tostada had had a burnt taste to it that I didn't like. It was kind of hard to eat. BUT, the carne was cooked to perfection. The el pastor was pretty amazing too although next time I'm gonna have to ask for no pineapple! YUCK! I hate anything sweet when I'm eating something savory! My taste palette doesn't know what to do! 

HH isn't really that great. $2 tacos and $1 off their beer and house wines. Barely missed HH but oh well."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as I wanted it to be :(
Got the el pastor & carnitas tacos .. no flavor on the meat .. so disappointed . Even sauces didn't help .. I guess back to Robertos!!"}
{"text":"Save your money and go to Roberto's or chipotle. Went to happy hour and they ran out of margarita's stating they could not give me a pitcher.  Made margaritas wrong adding salt when I said no salt. Then just dumped them into a new cup.  I tasted salt.  Food isn't horrible but it's nothing to talk about. Cooks are nice.  Bartenders lacking."}
{"text":"My friends like this place i do not.  The ordering system is jacked up and confusing.  The mariachi band waaaay too loud.  Price too high for what you get. Tacos have pretty good taste though. Street corn is yummy too.  I just don't like the experience there."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE Tacos El Gordo, but I'd have to say that Taco y Taco has meat that is just as delicious, but also provides you with a more relaxed and well dressed environment.

What do I mean by that? The decor is fun and friendly unlike that of other taco shops that are just tables and seats, white walls, and a place for the kitchen/taco preps.

The selections of taco meats are vast just like those of other taco places, however they do have a bar area here with beer and liquor to satisfy your tequila or beer drinking selves, and they have extras that most other places don't serve; Spanish rice, corn street style, Etc. 

This is now going to be my go to spot for tacos. The Location is much closer to us Henderson residents, definitely great food, clean seating, and fun atmosphere. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is freaking amazing!  The ordering can be a little cluster-f$&k!  Must get the tongue and the chicharrones!  And ALWAYS gotta get an elote!  Tacos are 2 biters... order 5.

The salsa bar is legit, but they just need bigger plastic containers to put them in... each cup is like half an ounce, so you need 4 hands just to grab 2 ounces of salsa!  The tables don't turn fast enough, and when they do, they're dirty."}
{"text":"Quick service and food smelled amazing as soon as we entered. The atmosphere is super chill and there is plenty of seating. The prices are definitely fair considering the quality of the food. I can see myself coming back for sure. 

I started with a few street tacos with different meats just to get a taste. I instantly ordered fries with 2 meats after tasting the carne asada and el pastor... The meat was super soft and flavorful.


** Here's a little YELP tip...try the horchata, you will not be disappointed**"}
{"text":"Went there on Wednesday 12/28/16 received a pretty decent food poisoning. Saturday 3 days later I'm finally feeling a little bit better. Symptoms came on about 1 hour after eating here. I ate two Pastore tacos and one barbacoa Vampiro.  Pretty positive it's in the Barbacoa not sure but definitely was from this restaurant because I had ate earlier in the day but a different restaurant and shared something with someone and they did not get sick and I felt fine after eating. This will be the third time I've ever been food poisoned and it's very similar. If you also got food poisoning here we should chat"}
{"text":"Came here for $2 tacos on Taco Tuesday. Seems like they only have select options of meat to qualify for $2, which was chicken and al pastor when I went.

The lines are set up like Tacos El Gordo, and if you've never been there, then you just line up at the place where you want your meat. Divided mostly by asada / lengua / al pastor. I usually get everything on my tacos. 

The bowl is also really good. Tastes better than Chipotle, except they only offer asada and chicken for the meat (sorry al pastor!)

The restaurant itself is nice. They have an upstairs for additional seating and also seats outside. It can definitely get busy though. You can order your tacos to go and they will wrap the plate with tinfoil."}
{"text":"I think I am giving up on this place the food is good but the ordering process is to chaotic. 

They really need to simplify the multiple lines. It's really confusing. 

I went with 3 other people. All of  us agreed that  it really wasn't worth the wait. 

Plus their salsa bar was mostly bare and was not replenished during our entire excruciatingly long visit."}
{"text":"This place rivals tacos el gordo... what stands out for me is the menu.  It has more of a variety that most taco shops and the condiment bars is pretty darn good too.  Both establishment met expectations and both serve BEER!!! They have elotes too... that a plus for me.  Check it out might like it!!!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place my coconut Mexican friend would create. He was loving the decor and loud music...not the type of music though, he wanted club stuff but I was pleased to listen to Peter Bjorn and John playing :-) I really like the look of the place very yuppie gringo. The tables are clean and so was the salsa bar. There was even a upstairs area which I didn't even realize until I left the restaurant and saw the stairs in the window. 

I had to try the Alpastor since that's my favorite and serves as a good bench mark. I had two with all the fixings, pineapple and all. I liked the pineapple on it but the sauce was so spicy I couldn't get the flavor of the Alpastor. I'll probably come back and try it again without the sauce but most likely go to the E. Tropicana location to see how they do it, word on the streets is their food is slightly better. Maybe it's all the gringo ambiance at this location, lack of authentic feel created a perception that effected my taste buds this wasn't the biz. Most likely it was the way too hot of sauce though :-/ 

Taco El Gordo still reign supreme ;-) but I'll come here for the cool music."}
{"text":"The best!! I was in Vegas for five weeks and ate here three or four times. The way you order takes a little getting used to but all the employees were very helpful! Having these burritos once a week and now having to go back to Chipotle is painful. If you are lucky enough to live close, this is a MUST try! Also, ?make sure you get custard from right next door."}
{"text":"This is for the eastern location. I love the one on Tropicana but the eastern one is terrible. It is a mess of a line and the service is awful! They advertised a special of buy 2 tacos get one free. Not only did they fail to honor there deal but than they messed up on my order. Go to the one on Tropicana the food and service is top notch and they treat the customer right. The one on eastern feels like a different restaurant entirely and not in a good. way."}
{"text":"One of my top taco spots in Vegas.
Super fresh,  you see them cooking the meats right in front of you. 
Get in a line,  choose what you want... enjoy!
A place to get all the sauces, too.
They have beer and sodas, too.
Cool decor, often busy but you still get in and eating in minutes. 
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place pretty much kicks major ass, and I'm thinking driving out there right now.   

Thanks to Jamie W advice, Taco Taco was a major bookmark for the week, and it's only a hop, skip,  jump from Henderson.    Well, not a that short of a trip, but it's closer than driving to Charleston for a few real tacos.

Located at the northeast corner of Tropicana and Peco at the north end of the strip center, Taco Taco stands out pretty good because of the very bright lighting inside.   Also, the place look huge from the outside, but it's kind of narrow when you walk in.   Seeing the set up of the ordering area, I could see some problem in the future when they start getting busy.   Thankfully, I got there late on Sunday night, and in the dining room  was kind of packed, but everyone was already eating.  

The place is set up like El Gordo, and you make your order at set stations for your order.   Unlike El Gordo, this places has more selection on the menu board, which was nice to see.     I ended up ordering two Asada, two Al Pastor, and a Mexican corn on a cob.

As I was placing my order, one of the cooks were making corn tortillas from scratch.   I was very please to see this, because when bite into my first bite I could tell a total difference between Taco Taco and other places like like them.    My toritilla wasn't soaked in oil, like another place famous for this, and I was very pleased with the taste of  the meat.   I would put them on par with El Gordo, but they put way more meat than them, and had the killer salsa bar.    I was stunned to see the multiple  selection, and they even had pinto and black beans as a selection inside of the bar.

I almost feel like giving this place a five star, and I should but.....I'm going to visit them a few times before giving them that award.    BTW, that Mexican corn was KILLER!"}
{"text":"The food is good but some of the staff is rude. If you're having a bad day, don't go here...it will make it worse. The menu is confusing as well and the staff acts like they're irritated to explain how it works, if you don't like your job get a new one."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco experience I've ever had and this is coming from someone that's born and raised in Los Angeles. Anyone outside of Vegas visiting needs to come here as it is worth the drive off the strip! Asada, barbacoa and carnitas were ridiculously moist with loads of flavor! Can't go wrong with tacos or a burrito but you're better off getting tacos as you can try more than one meat to find your weapon of choice.  And save room for an Elote/corn on the cob!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had my share of Mexican food.  This place is one of the best!  Try the el pastor mula. Try everything! It's a cant go wrong kind of place.  Please open a west side location!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian soyrizo is the way to go.  Also a fully loaded elote.  Good sized space.  It can be noisy.  Vegetarians can skip the lines and go straight to the counter on the left."}
{"text":"Yum!  I think the ordering process is a little confusing at first, but once you've been there, it's easy.

I'm a HUGE nacho person; theirs are just okay.  I felt like they didn't have enough cheese, and the cheese that was on there was hardly melted. 

BUT, the tacos are great!  I love the carnitas, but my favorite were the vampiro!  I had never had one before, but it was outstanding!  The cheese was caramelized and crispy.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This is across town for me, so we won't go often, but when a taco craving strikes, for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boo for a quick dinner. He said it's set up similar to tacos el Gordo, just a bit fancier. The set up and the overall restaurant is pretty cool. The lines they had for certain meats were interesting, they didn't have too many people working but the service was great and very friendly. 

Honestly honestly, I wanted to really like this place but I didn't really like the meat at all... I had carneasada and chorizo and it just didn't taste like authentic meat. The chorizo was very fluffy and weird like an egg tofu like texture. It looked like soy chorizo or something. And it didn't have much flavor at all. It didn't have that like oil and flavor that chorizo usually has. The Asada didn't even taste like Asada it tasted like shredded roast beef or something. Authentic Mexican Asada is like that thick ranchero meat. That's the good stuff. And if your paying $2.25 a taco they should be using the good genuine stuff. I don't care about the guacamole and stuff they put on it, the meat is what I care about.

They use handmade tortillas but it's not the masa kind but they use the kal (yellow) kind. And it didn't taste bad but it wasn't like they freshly made them. They were pre made hand made tortillas. 

My boyfriend had the al pastor tacos and a mula. He enjoyed it, he especially liked the pineapple on it. 

They have a really amazing salsa bar, fresh limes and carrots and grilled onions there as well. It is a very clean and put together restaurant. Very beautiful layout and atmosphere. Great place to hang out, just wasn't a fan of their food :/"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food. Good people. Love the fact they have real tacos in a very unpretentious place....go there and u won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great tacos (over priced, but yummy) but the whole window sitch based one what your ordering is not ideal. Once someone that has never been there bf forms the line incorrectly complete disarray happens. I don't think that they don't give an itemized receipt. How can I be sure I'm not being over charged.."}
{"text":"We have been to a lot of taco places here in town, but this one is our favorite! Great flavor and quality!"}
{"text":"For me I loved it here definitely coming back friendly fast and good also great prices gonna check out happy hour for sure"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food was awesome!
And the space has a great vibe!

One of my besties just moved to this area and asked me to meet him there for dinner. -YUM!!!

Ordered a couple Al Pastor tacos, shaved, sauced and served with a little pineapple an the top. Don't miss these! WOWZA!

Also ordered Lengua and it was SO, SO TENDER!! 
Shrimp Tacos, shockingly one of the less interesting, but still totally great!

And of course Elote - The corn was a TINY bit over cooked, but the flavor made up for it!

Last, and definitely not least....The jamaica for a drink. Quite possible the best I have ever had!!! 

Everything made with love! I can't wait to go back!!
SO good!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed! Brought my family in for the second time and seems like everytime we come they are out of some sort of fountain drink. Last time was Horchata...This time is was the coke. Who runs out of coke? Or are they too lazy to change the syrup & tank?
Ordered carne asada tacos which the hubby liked. Also ordered carne asada nachos...chips were so hard, meat tasted like beef jerky and lack of.  An al pastor mula... Seriously where is the meat? Sure just cover up with onions, cilantro & pineapple. One good thing is the salsa bar with pinto beans & roasted chilies with onion. And they must of ran out of limes...there was only lemons... Probably won't be back..."}
{"text":"Bomb! Go here for the Langua tacos. Sauce is excellent and has some spice. Burritos are Really good and the Guac.... Lets just say it pretty damn good, especially if you like lime. 
I have only been here once though, so I hope this place stays consistent."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. The al pastor and al carbon are excellent. I would go there all the time for the food but the ordering system always confuses me. With no standard menu and no system in place to direct you where to go it's a little confusing of you're not used to it. But the food is worth the wait/confusion."}
{"text":"Taco Me Taco!

The fact that I have never written a review for Taco Y Taco still blows me away. I've been here a number of times and maybe I've just been taco wasted on vampiro and carnitas? 

My most recent visit here was on Taco Tuesday and the place was packed, all the taco lines were full and the burrito area was starting to fill up as well. I have to hand it to Taco Y Taco; they emptied the lines very quick and sent everyone on their way to taco happiness. I was not partaking in the taco fiesta today, nope, chicken mole fries were in my future. 

Shredded chicken, creamy mole sauce, shredded cheese and cotija cheese all on top of a mound of sweet potato fries. The sweet crispy fries mixed with the savory sweet mole sauce is amazing, then you add super tender marinated chicken to the food fiesta and all bets are off. 

Mole Fries is a cure all meal; hangovers, gone!, hunger pains, gone!, the mixed feeling of angry and hungry or, \"Hangry\" as I like to call it, all gone! Besides the moles fries, Taco Y Taco has... amazing tacos, duh. Cooked old school like I used to see when I would visit TJ when I lived in San Diego. The meat is simmered for hours and then chopped in front of you and placed on a handmade tortilla. 

TYT also offers a full bar, I recommend getting a Red Beer. Great compliment to some amazing authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Clean place and great service. I over ordered and could not eat it all. Miguel went out of his way to accommodate some special requests. A little spendy but I would go back."}
{"text":"the best taco place in las vegas in my opinion.  i been to many taco places and since i found this place , we come here now . Service is fast , no huge lines.  Plenty of seating . Great customer service . The environment is family friendly ."}
{"text":"I guess after 10 check-ins I should review this place lol. However, this review is seriously on only 3 menu items. Everytime I try to make myself get something new, I talk myself out of it and get the Al Pastor tacos. Super flavorful and not soggy tortillas (big pet peeve) and pineapple!  Yum! I've tried the elote once before but didn't get it again because I was too full to eat my tacos afterwards and just because im not really a fan of elote in general. Lol good flavor, and really sweet corn. Next, the only drink I get is horchata! Not too sweet or grainy, it's perfect!
In my opinion, this place is better than Tacos El Gordo, Pepe's, Roberto's, Fauto's, Las Gorditas, Jalisco Cantina, Imperial Tacos & Beer, and Taco Tijuana. I'm no expert on tacos or anything lol I just reaaaally like them. I could live off tacos haha. They are fresher, bigger portions, bigger flavor, better sauces, more seating (especially their location on Eastern) and faster. I've yet to try the rest of their menu but they have lengua, asada, barbacoa, carnitas, tripas and lots of other meat options, plus some nonmeat options like soy chorizo, veggies, and panela. They also offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls (definitely need to try this ), vampiros, tostadas. Their salsa bar is also pretty expansive. Favorite tacos in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good..fresh food. Pleasant and helpful service. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. Alcoholic drinks could hav been better. Luv the choice of sauces...the hot ones weren't really hot but very tasty."}
{"text":"$1 Corn today! Hola!! Best street corn and tacos al pastor in town!!! Great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"They've taken over the Republic Kitchen space and did a little bit of re-formatting but if you remember what RK looked like... it hasn't changed a lot in terms of space and feel.  

They did convert most of the bar area into walk-up, taco order stations.  There are a couple different stations which are not clearly identified so you'll just need to walk up, hail someone working and ask for what you want and they'll tell you where you need to order.  To me.... this isn't really all that convenient because you could be standing in the wrong area only to find out you need to order what you want 2 feet to your left which may or may not have a line.  And the line situation is just whoever speaks up first because the \"line\" isn't all that defined.

And then there's the cashier.  I don't know if she was new or just confused.  She rang us up, my husband ordered a beer which requires a totally separate transaction and then when I ordered my soft drink she said she had already processed our order and had to ring up my drink separately from everything else.  Why would you finish ringing up an order before asking if we wanted another beverage or anything else?  Not the best experience.

The taste of the food was really good and had great flavor.

But the service and the way the whole place is set up just turns me off so I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came to enjoy Mexican food for Cinco de Mayo with my boyfriend, only to be in an unorganized line. Understandable that the line was long due to it being Cinco de Mayo, but that was not the case at all for the line with Elotes/seafood. They had 2 employees working the line and one of which was filling up the containers (when they were already full) to avoid helping other customers, making the line longer and clearly preventable. The man who took my order was trying to multi task but I eventually got tired of waiting for my tacos so just purchased my elote. As I am with the cashier, I see the gentleman who took my order (has glasses and a California state tattoo on his neck) pointing at me, clearly being unprofessional to top off my 40 minutes wasted in line. This was my second time coming here and will not be returning. Poor customer service and terrible organization. Will not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great Food. Big taco portions, and the salsa bar is a plus! Must check out if nearby."}
{"text":"ELOTES. Yassss. 
Best elotes in town, hands down!
This place is super far from me or i'd go all the time. It's worth the drive though 
I'm vegetarian and there's not a whole lot of options out there for veggie tacos, usually just boring quesadillas and stuff, but this place has soyrizo, a soy taco meat and it's bomb! Seasoned really well, and tastes great with cilantro. 
I love their house beer on draft. It's all about the flavore.
The vibe of this place is great as well! There 2 floors to sit and eat. They have happy hour and music too. 
All in all, a really cool place to go to eat"}

{"text":"Easy 4 stars! And had the experience not been confusing, it would be 5! YES- believe the hype, tacos el Gordo don't have nothin' on this Al Pastor! 
We entered through the back of the restaurant but there is no way of telling that from the outside. There weren't specific instructions on where or how to order, just a bunch of taco stations. Each station offered something different. I am still not sure if you order at the station, or at the person up front explaining things. 
What I do know is this was some of the best taco meat I've had, ever, in life. 
I went with 2 al pastors and one carne. They were all exceptional, but the al pastor took the cake. I could eat 5 of these, and will FOR SURE opt for the grande size taco on my next visit. 
The salsa bar had 6 salsas, carrots, onions, radishes, jalapeños, cucumbers and limes. Did I mention besides all the awesome selections it was extremely clean?!! 
I'm hoping the confusing part will fade as they figure out how to run things because I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day for lunch, I was alone & was not sure if I would get it to go or eat there. The place is clean & you can watch everything going on as they cook! To my surprise they had a bar area so I ordered my food & sat there had a beer, corn on the cob (MX style) yum & a taco! Everything was tasty & I felt comfortable being alone the staff were very nice! I left full & content!"}
{"text":"Vegan options at a street taco joint? Yep! They have soyrizo, veggies, cactus and more that you can make into tacos, a burrito, nachos.... they have really tasty guacamole as well. There is a complimentary salsa bar that has a few different salsas, roasted Serrano peppers, pickles carrots and onions, black and pinto beans. You can load up on all that and beer or a cocktail for a nice inexpensive meal with some tacos. 

For my meat eating friends, they have a couple meat options. Al pastor is a crowd favorite. They also offer tostadas, sopes and more. Street corn and breakfast burritos are also on the menu. This place is delicious and the decor is really nice looking."}
{"text":"Don't get there bowls, rice taste terrible, meat is hard,simply disappointing. tacos are pretty good when given hot, I've came here a few times, food is inconsistent. This will definitely be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! This concept is great the energy is high the vibe is fun the food is fantastic. And I just had the best breakfast burrito of my life!"}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but amazing things about this place so I was excited when finally I got the chance to try it out. When I walked in call me stupid but it is set up very differently which can be kind of confusing. I walk up to the first guy am say that I've never been there and I wasn't sure how I go about ordering, he clearly didn't speak English and started yelling \"oh NACHOS NACHOS\" pointing to another man who just stared at me. I was made so uncomfortable that I walked out and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"First time here, very confusing,I wish one of the people behind the counter would have given us an idea how it works. The young guy that prepared my beef tostado was friendly and put me ease. The food was very authentic tasting, very good."}
{"text":"What a hot mess of a place. 
The outside facade and the entry way are one design. Then you walk in to what reminds me of a college cafeteria- salsa bar, soda fountain, and random loud music blaring. And I mean RANDOM- from Ginuwine's Pony, to Coldplay, to Tejano. 
The lines to order were a bit confusing for a first timer even with the signs. It was hard to hear the servers with the enormously deep counters. And the counters were so tall that I had to stand on my tippy toes and yell and point at the food that I wanted to order. 
The bar is so tiny and it holds like 4 stools. Not a place to sit and unwind with your friends.
The total for my 2 gran tacos and a water was $12. Now that is not a good deal in my opinion. 
It was just too much for too little. Not my ideal spot for a meal."}
{"text":"I appreciate the liberal use of cheese and the fact that I can get mole. The ordering system is different, but it doesn't seem like a hard and fast rule. I dig the gran tacos and the fact that I can get Coke in a medio litro. There are lots of salsas to choose from too. Solid place. I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Taco y taco is the best!  

Standouts include the Al pastor , vampires, chicken tacos, and the street corn

Full bar and heat food. Great place to grab a bite late. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with some other reviewers. Just meh. Ordered a burrito bowl, fresh ingredients, guacamole was pretty good. Went to pay and the price listed on the menu is wrong, the price they charge is more expensive. Overall, you can get a better meal at chipotle or get your money's worth over at cafe rio. Expensive for mediocre food, will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"OK here's the deal.. before entering, you have to take a deep breath, relax, and tell yourself \"Its worth it.. just go to your happy place in your head during the ordering process\".

The ordering process is bizarre. They have a line for each type of item. So if you want a pork taco, you wait in the pork line. If you want chicken, you wait in the chicken line. The chicken line might be a 20 min wait while the pork guy is sitting around staring at the crowd, but that's how they do it.  The guy who takes your order is behind a counter and then behind a chopping table , so he's around 8 feet away. It's a loud place, so he wont be able to hear you unless you yell your order. Everyone I have ever ordered from doesn't speak English as their first language, so there's usually a confusing back and forth where they don't understand my order and I don't understand what they are saying. Sometimes they have flour tortillas. Sometimes I ask for flour tortillas and they look at me like I just ordered a nuclear reactor. I just take whatever they are happy to give me. 

Why go through the stress of ordering this way? Cuz they make the best damn tacos in Vegas! Give them a try and you will see why its worth it."}
{"text":"Yummy meats n street corn restaurant style..i love that the meats come from the restaurant's family owned carniceria!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm best michelada/ red beer in town! Happy hour menu rocks! And as a basic white girl, it's nice to be able to communicate what I want with the waiter lol two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos! Yum! The initial visit is a bit overwhelming as the service system is unique. Speak Spanish? Great! If not, you will undoubtedly be able to ask a fellow patron for advice. Once you know what KIND of taco you want it's easy, walk up to the corresponding number and the chef will prepare it for you, made to order. My husband and I are vegetarian and we had lots of options. We chose soy chorizo & cactus. We each had a taco and shared nachos. The salsa bar is amazing! To top off our delicious meal, 2 cervezas mas finas."}
{"text":"I love the tripe & adobada tacos & quesadillas!!! Ask for real guacamole and tip the guy! Goes well with A Michelada yummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of variety but the ordering process is a little confusing.  People always seem to jump ahead of me in line and that is annoying.  I have been here 3 times and tried something different each time.  Worth a try because it is not expensive."}
{"text":"Walking into this place I was definitely skeptical whether the tacos would taste like authentic Mexican tacos. As a Mexican, living here in henderson I'd always have to drive all the way across town just to get some decent tacos. So one day me and my girlfriend heard there silly commercial on the radio, which I think the guy talking is hilarious! We end up going, first impression of the place was definitlely interesting, there was a Dj playing, tons of young hip people eating, and I liked it. Then came the real test, I ordered 2 tacos al pastor, and 2 of carnitas. All I have to say was that I was amazed, I have finally found some real authentic tacos that within 3 miles of my home. Highly recommend this taco place to anybody who loves and knows what real tacos should taste like."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always delicious. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. The concept of the food is great, although figuring out which line to go to is a little confusing. All together this is a great Mexican Restaurant, will confidently recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Yes it's comparable to tacos el gordo but don't let everyone know that! Prices are about the same, toppings are the same, but ... lines are shorter, to go containers for sauces are super tiny, they offer ELOTES!!! (Mexican corn) and meat is kind of not as good. 

Try taco y taco if you don't to deal with an hour wait  at tacos el gordo. They have quite a few seats and the salsa bar is fresh and offers the same items you would see at other taco places. 

Their tacos come with onions, cilantro, salsa and guacamole and they don't skimp on the meat! Also, the carne Asada fries here are 100xs better than Tacos el gordo. 

I almost forgot to mention that they have Hapoy hour EVERYDAY from 5-7 pm. I saw chicken nachos or 3 carnitas tacos and a few other items for $5 each."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I love the al pastor tacos and vampiro. So yummy. But no meal here is complete with out a an elote and some horchata."}
{"text":"What does a taco place and a live DJ have in common at 11:00 am on a Sunday? Absolutely nothing. And the ordering process looks like Terminal D at McCarran."}
{"text":"It's places like these that make me realize Yelp is full shit. I've been here twice, first I went vegetarian simply because I don't trust the meat at a lot of places, I got a rice bowl, with beans, some weird mushroom mixture, rice, salsa and lettuce. It was flavorless and stomach churning. Got chips and guacamole, again flavorless.  I decided, it's just another shitty mexican joint that I will drive past and ignore, like most. 

A couple months go by, I hear they are opening multiple locations, I decided I must have missed something, so I went back for lunch this last weekend.  My wife and I got 2 Street corn on the cobs with \"butter\", chili powder and lime. Butter has quotes around it cause what they use, that shit is not butter. I got a pastor burrito and my wife got a rice bowl. We also got chips and guacamole and I got a coke. 

First, the corn was forgettable, makes you appreciate the dude selling it on the street. My burrito was God awful, the pork tastes like it's seasoned with kool-aid packets, I took 2 bite and lost 100% of my appetite. One of the worst meals I had ever had. Chips were stale and guacamole taste like it was left over from last time I was there. No salsa bar. My wife's bowl was nothing more than OK. My coke was spectacular. 

As I said, my food was terrible, but also, their ordering system is terrible, welcome to America, learn our procedures. With a normal ordering system you might be able to cut down on the 3 extra employees standing around checking their Facebook. 

Did I mention the temperature, oh ya, it was unbelievable hot in the dining area, my wife actually stood up and lowered the thermostat, it didn't help. We both left dripping with sweat and our clothes stretched out, my wife considered taking her pants off for the ride home to air out. It was disgusting. The temperature, not my wife taking her pants off. 

Lastly, this place clearly has a corrupted Yelp, don't believe any of the reviews. I wish you could give zero stars."}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly. The facility is very clean. The food is always amazing. What more do I need to say? If you like great mexican food at a great price, go there!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Went back again... Loved it!!

Too many delicious things to choose from. 

The condiment bar is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had such an amazing dinner chowing down on the Azteca Gran Taco. A great atmosphere and awesome street tacos! I can't wait to come back! There are so many options I wanted them all!"}
{"text":"Everything what is expected 
From a good taco place clean
Fast service I had al pastor 
There's a salsa bar"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Try the  VAMPIRO !!! Sooooo Good!!! The corn is delish! Great atmosphere and decor. Clean and organize. Order your food watch how the customize your order !"}
{"text":"I have been to both locations now and I can say this is a pretty cool taco spot. Although I will admit that for a first timer, the ordering is a little different at both places. Depending on what meat you prefer is where you order from. I came with some friends of the family who don't exactly frequent places like this and the salsa that was added to their tacos without being asked was pretty spicy, even to my standards and I love spicy foods! They remade them no problem. I'd say the staff is mostly Spanish speaking but you are still able to communicate just fine. I don't eat meat anymore so I love when places offer vegan/ vegetarian options and I was surprised to see it at a place like this. The chorizo and mushroom tacos with everything on them were amazing. These are a just try if you are interested in skipping meat. Just make sure to order 2! One of each! I've been twice now and will be back when I have a craving for these tacos!"}
{"text":"Here's the scenario...
You're hungry
You're on the way to a BBQ
Host of said BBQ is going to be 20 min late...
What do you do? What. Do. You. Do?

You say screw the BBQ and pick up a burrito at Taco Taco! Done deal. I had heard about this place during a late night Yelp menu reading session (it's a problem) and when I saw I was in the area, there was no turning back. 

Upon walking in you're greeted with the biggest taco shop dining room you've ever seen. Soccer playing on the TV, salsa bar to the right. Perfect. Problem? It was at least 100 degrees in the place. With griddles fired up in the open kitchen, you need that AC popping! I was forced to take this meal to-go. 

The menu is fairly simple. Burrito, taco, bowl, gran taco (taco with extra toppings). Fill with toppings and meats. Done. I rocked a burrito filled with al pastor (which you can see marinating in the corner), cheese, guac, pico, black beans, lettuce, hot salsa and a bit of rice. $7. Size? Perfect. A single meal wrapped up. Not a small baby or an app. Taste. WOW. Easily the best burrito I've ever had. The tender, moist spiced meat mixed with all the ingredients well and there was no 'filler bites' of rice or toppings. There was so much flavor, I barely used the salsa I took with me. Typically, I wouldn't give a place 5 stars based on one menu item, but considering the while menu is what I ate wrapped in different shells, I think it's OK. Skip the BBQ. Grab the burrito. Everyone will understand."}
{"text":"TyT still serves a g*d d*amn, m*ther f*ckin good burrito.... but not as good as the other location. My go-to, the al pastor burrito, didn't knock my socks off as it usually does. I'm gonna say it's bc you order 'ritos from a good 30 ft from the spit, so they cut of slices and keep it in a container, which dries out the meat, but really, I have no clue what the problem was. Beyond that, the salsa counter is still amazing (8 different salsas and a number of sides) and the digs, whoa, MAJOR upgrade to from the other location. High ceilings, interesting furniture... well done! Other props go to the fact that a side of guac is monstrous. That NEVER happens. 

Bottom line, is it as good at the one on Trop? No. Is it still a solid place to go for a good burrito? Yessir.  

Protip: full bar in this mamma jamma"}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at Taco Taco as my office is not far away.

First off - I'll say that the place is very very clean.  In addition to it being clean - it's an open kitchen so you can see the food being cooked and prepared in front of you.  Right in front of where you place your order - there is a hand washing station.  Guests can use it as well as employees if they are out on the floor.  Their refrigerator unit is behind the cashier and it's glass so you can clearly see inside of it.

I ordered a small carne asada fries which was $4.95.  It was packed with meat, cheese, pico, guac and your choice of black or refried beans.  I opted for the black beans.Quite honestly -I can't imagine what the full size order for $9.25 is because this small order would more than suffice.

In addition - I ordered carne asada tacos - these, too were amazing but I asked them to hold the guac and it turns out they put it on there anyway.  That's the only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars.

Everyone was helpful and for the price - you really can't beat it."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've had in awhile! Their al pastor meat is on point! Didn't have room for the mole fries but those are on my list for my next run here"}
{"text":"Decent place for variety of tacos. Little contemporary/hipster interior.  I like it in general for casual tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Home made tortillas and everything is very tasty! My new favorite taco spot."}
{"text":"Love this place  el pastor is amazing !! Staff is awesome  super friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"This place has amazing and delicious tacos! I am very pleased. My fiance and I tried the barbacoa and a corn. They were great! The line/ ordering system is a little confusing and the establishment would benefit from more staff. Yet, if you are looking for great Street style tacos this place is a must. Their eastern location is great as well."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Las Vegas. The al pastor tacos cannot be duplicated. The ordering system is a little intimidating the first time you go but don't let that stop you! And don't be afraid to branch out and try some of the less popular meats. They are ALL good here. I also love the lengua and tripa and my kids request it too! They have a great salsa bar complete with beans and all the traditional taco bar things you want from a taco joint. Nice bar, good music, great drinks and the food is seriously amazing. Staff is also great and always willing to answer questions and make suggestions."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok. Just as good as tacos el gordo. I think I like the pecos location a little more."}
{"text":"I have been to Taco Y Taco 12 times according to my Yelp check ins. I used to feel pretty good about spending my money for some of their delicious tacos. NOT ANYMORE.
Taco Y Taco will not get another cent of my hard earned money. In fact, if someone offered to treat me to tacos at their restaurant, i would decline the offer.
Consistently poor service is the reason for my denying them my future patronage.
From the cashier to the taco cooks, there are no smiles at all. The sign does not say, but I suspect smiles would happen if I placed a tip in the jar. Hello, it doesn't work that way... you have to treat me nice first! 
My recent and last visit was an interaction with the taco cook that was rude to say the least. I ordered the happy hour street tacos and he looked over my shoulder at the clock (it was 6:15 pm) and he gazed at said clock for what seemed like a solid minute. Then, he doesn't make the tacos. I wait and order a quesadilla from the quesadilla area (again, no smile there either). I go back to the taco area (where there are now 2 other customers ordering tacos. Still no tacos. I stare at the taco guy and he looks back at me and I say, tacos??? He looks at me and says tacos. I said remember, I ordered street tacos. He gives the other customers a look and then looks back at me. I should have walked out but did not.
Flash forward to the cashier and she rings up my $13 order and I ask to add one drink. Total comes to $23+. I say that is too much and read off what I have on my tray. She said no, that is the total. She reads off to me what I have on my tray and I ask how that adds up to $23+??? She tells me it does and I am done with the back and forth so I pay and ask for the receipt. The receipt shows nachos and I tell her that I do not have nachos. She points to my container and says nachos and I tell her that is chips and guacamole (also on the receipt) and she tells me she thought it was both chips/guacamole and nachos. All in one container???

Yep, Taco Y Taco, I am done with you and your rude service. Clearly the customer is never right... or appreciated."}
{"text":"Scouted this place out on instagram & yelp before our trip to Vegas and was very pleased that the reviews seemed accurate. Came in and the place was quiet with only a handful of people already eating. Service was prompt. You order at the counter and theres a selection of ingredients/toppings to build your menu choice with (I ordered nachos no meat) Came in especially looking forward to trying the elote; which was good. My husband enjoyed his tacos and said the meat was tender and had good flavor. The salsa bar was also a nice feature because I practically drink salsa."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I got really nervous about the ordering process. It's a bit confusing with the separate lines for different meats but just look above the stations and order there. I wouldn't say Taco Y Taco is THAT much better than other taco shops in the area, but I do love one thing no one else has: Vampiro tacos. It's basically two hard tortillas sandwiching whatever meat and fillings would normally come in a taco. It's a little more difficult to eat, but it's crunchy and super filling. Other than that, the tacos are better than other shops in that the meat isn't super fatty and the quality of the fillings is great (guacamole!). I've also had the cheese quesadilla but I didn't really like the taste of the cheese and there was a bit too much of it. This is also the best option for dining in because the space is huge and has a salsa and condiment bar."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Everything is super fresh. Asada is real good and the Al Pastor is even better.

My only complaint is the way this location is set up, it can be a little confusing for first timers. 

Regardless, awesome spot for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! After years of searching for tacos for years with my boyfriend that I would actually enjoy eating and not push aside like I always do , I found this amazing place!! Better then tacos el Gordo an I will let everyone know ."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but a very confusing ordering system. If you're not careful, your meal can be very small. It's almost like tapas, you have to order multiple things. When you ask for help, you can barely understand them. The food is delicious though."}
{"text":"Currently have the absolute biggest craving ever for some el Pastor from this place. I need these tacos in my life again! Everything is very fresh. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I'm not a fan of the \"check out\" system... by the time you sit down, the majority of your food is cold. First, you stand in line, then it's cafeteria tray style & you get your food, but this is where it allows time for your food to get cold. Also, it is a tad bit pricey for some tacos, they are an average of $2.50 each. I ate 4 of them & left a bit hungry still. Regardless,... this place is so worth it, and I highly recommend giving it a try. Better than Tacos El Gordo, but same kind of concept!!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place!  Amazing tacos and very, very affordable!   The service was spot on, though a long line the cook was very patient with my questions...."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is incredible and priced well! Although, upon first visit, one might need some guidance through the ordering process. The lines are set up in stations that are separated by meat choice. 

I recommend the fish, chorizo and Barbacoa tacos.

This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Always good vibes when I come in.

MICHELADA.. get their michelada it's the best one I have found in town. I come here once a week for it.

Happy hour deals are great and filling. Also, happy hour is EVERYDAY! 5pm- 7pm  Theeee best!"}
{"text":"Very similar to Tacos El Gordo. Nice set up, a lot of tables and there is an upstairs dining as well. Prices are average. The pastor is amazing as well as the vampira style.
I love how they have elotes, especially the Mexican street style. Their salsa bar is amazing so many options to choose from. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Heard of this place a while back. Finally made my way out there. I didn't get too fancy. 2 carne Asada tacos and 1 chicharron taco. For starters the carne Asada tacos were good. Definitely a million times better than Robertos and tacos Mexico.. personally I found chicharron taco way better the texture was on point. Adding the crunch to it made it great. Definitely my new taco for whenever I get the cravings. Too funny it's 15 miles away from home. I highly recommend this spot. The worker was super cool too. Told him it was my first time, dude was super cool to show me what was up and how to order. Cool spot."}
{"text":"The tacos were really good! You have to get a few of them to fill you up though. My favorite was the carneasada taco. I also got guacamole and that was a must try. The Tripp tacos were not as good as I thought they would be. All and all it's a good experience and a good place to go if you want tacos."}
{"text":"The salsa bar had some great variety of salsa. The el pastor tacos are some of the best in town. I had 2 give it 3 stars because the quality of the steak tacos were not good.  The meat was fatty n not well season ed. The service was friendly however it's really loud with the band playing."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican tacos compared to what can be found in L.A.!!!  They load them up with meat too.  I tried the al pastor and cabeza tacos.  The meat in the al pastor is much leaner than the ones at Tacos El Gordo, which is good if you're planning to eat a lot of them.

Friendly staff that does their part to keep the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this place today while we were in town, and wow! The building, the people that work there and the food were all amazing! This place was immaculately clean, the salsa bar was fresh and well stocked, and the tacos were spot on. We will so be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"My tacos got cold from waiting in line :(
Its ok that they went around Las Vegas picking and copying other taquerias best sellers, but why also copy tacos el gordo bullshit service counter idea???? I gave them 2 chances the the same result, cold food by the time We got to our table.
The service nothing good, it's like Pepes Tacos"}
{"text":"got to get just a lil taste of the Taco Taco goodness at a yelp event tonight and im a huge fan already! I tried the al pastor sample taco and it was amazing! and i got a comp coupon to try their street corn on cob so ill be stopping in to get a real meal!"}
{"text":"Confession Time. Authentic Mexican food places intimidate me. I am very interested in trying out new things but rarely do because of the language barrier. The staff at Taco Taco are the nicest most helpful staff I have ever had at an 'over the counter' restaurant. My first time in they took the time to explain the entire menu and let me sample all the different meats. It was a great experience. I settled on soyrizo.

The food is excellent. As a confused white guy I think of Taco Taco as a chipotle style establishment with real Mexican tastes. I make a point to stop by and try something new whenever I am on the east side."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with 2 of 3 items we ordered! The third was good.
The carne asada taco was dry and very little flavor in meat.
The al pastor burrito had flavorless white beans and oddly flavored meat.
The only decent item was the buche taco. Good flavor on the meat.
The service was minimal until the cashier-- she was pleasant.
Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"the tacos were really good....they have several different meats to try.  The Al Pastor was by far the best...it came with mango salsa....yum!  The corn on the cob was also really good.  What got me was the price of a fountain soda...$2.50...for a styrofoam cup that you fill your self....that is outrageous...can only imagine what they charge for beer or a mixed drink.   We will go back for the tacos....but will pass on the drinks!"}
{"text":"Great variety and very well done food. The gordo tacos are awesome and their el pastor is perfect.
They actually create their own well crafted food. No short cuts just very high quality, delicious Mexican taqueria food."}
{"text":"Just as good as the location on Tropicana.

I suggest that you take some of the sauces and mix them. I like adding that green sour  cream guacamole with the red roasted peppers salsa."}
{"text":"Omg what just happened? So much flavor! I wasn't expecting that!

I had carnitas taco, al pastor gran taco and a mexican style corn.

The carnitas taco was amazing, but i'm not sure if it was the taco itself the sauces i added from the salsa bar! Either way it was amazing.

The mexican style corn was delicious."}
{"text":"This might be the best mexican resturant in las vegas. They have a great selection of meats and vegan opitions.  They also have awesome side and a huge selection of salsas.  I love that they have mole, elote and horchata!  Its good for groups and kids.  Its spacious, nicely decorated, and they have friendly staff!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food that is impossible to order.  The lines are confusing but the prices are high for a hand full of ingredients. Don't know why this place is rated so high, but I know I'm not coming back especially since Cafe Rio is so close. There I can get a lot more, better tasting and at better prices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! By far the best taco place in LV! The tortillas are made fresh! The team out here is so nice! The place is clean! Best ever!"}
{"text":"YUM-O!!! The tacos are absolutely ridiculous!!! Try the Barbacoa and the El Pastor tacos.... Slow roasted Pork and tortillas made from scratch right infrint of you'"}
{"text":"Good food. The line ISNT that confusing once you walk in and know what kind of meat you want, but other people have told me they find it to be confusing. I think the prices are a little high personally, especially if you want a few (or more tacos) they have your basic salsa and sauce side station as well."}
{"text":"Since this was my first time I was totally confused by their ordering process.  The staff was helpful but I am amazed at the poor ordering set up.  Cafe Rio could teach the management how to properly set up ordering. 
   I was craving some Tijuana tacos and I must say they satisfied the craving.  I had the Carne Asada tacos and they were delicious. The pork was also perfect.  I was literally transported to the streets of Tijuana during my moment of zen while devouring these great tacos.  
   The salsa bar has a great selection but to add to the confusion the lids are only given to you after payment.  Wasn't impressed with controlled salsa bar.  
   I will be back as the Tijuana tacos are very good but will eat in next time.  They have some unique food not found in the standard Mexican places."}
{"text":"I went last night for dinner with friends -- however the mariachi band was playing, and was super loud (so if you're wanting to talk and have conversation with your fellow dinees, don't go on Mondays between 6-7pm).  Thankfully they only played for the first 20 minutes of our outing and we were all able to catch up! 
My first impression was a fancier Tacos El Gordo (still my number 1) with smaller portions.  The food overall was a tad salty for my liking, but then again I like sodium in low doses. 

I ordered two chicken tortas with everything (this included onions, pico de gallo, and guacamole - which was amazing).  They were small but delicious and reasonably priced.  With this I ordered a side of chips and guacamole (because you can never have too much guac) and the serving was a large quantity and every one at the table was able to enjoy -- although, like mentioned before, a tad too salty for me. 

Overall, I enjoyed the venue (modern, artsty) and the ambiance was nice.  I'll probably be back but this won't become a regular spot. 

PS. I wish they didn't use paper and Styrofoam cases and plates....so bad for the environment and I don't think they recycle. ):"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ended up spending $19 for some pretty basic tasting Mexican food. There is nothing authentic about this place just over priced Mexican food. The food I could handle but the customer service was the worst I have experienced in a while. The girl working the register was sucking down her boba tea while ringing me up then wanted to complain when I made a comment about the price when she said $19!!! She even went as far as saying she canceled the food cause it's \"too much\" I will never be back for this over priced Mexican food with the rudest customer service in the shopping center"}
{"text":"The Al Pastor had the perfect balance of sweet and heat. I will definitely have it again probably two! I also had the corn, Mexican street style, the paprika made the corn seem even sweeter. The staff was friendly and accommodating...I guess they just needed to see a smiling face to prompt them to offer assistance. Taco Y Taco will be on my lunch list favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.  I had gone to this place a few months back and it was great. This weekend we decided to get a quick bite and ended up here for a couple tacos and some corn. 
The guy cutting the Barbacoa picked up my meat with his bare hands, no gloves. And it was just a straight piece of fat in the Barbacoa tacos. I had to ask if they can give me new meat and they looked at me like I was crazy. 
My only advice is watch them when they make your tacos oh and the employees must have not realized I understood Spanish. ? smh. I heard a few choice words aimed at my request for new meat but I won't sweat the small stuff!"}
{"text":"The tacos el pastor is good! Tacos here will never taste like the ones in Mexico but these come close enough!"}
{"text":"ELOTE ELOTE ELOTE! 

I will have to say it was empty when we came in on a Monday dinner time & the setting is interesting. The staff was nice... although the al pastor guy station was a little grumpy... hahaha he was cursing in Spanish when I asked for flour tortilla on my MULA instead of corn, but they should have asked instead of assuming... plus I can understand Spanish so it was a bit =\ 
Other than that everything was good.

I would have to say this place is almost as AWESOME as tacos El gordo... but they do have their perks w/ the BOMB elote that they wonderfully COVER the ENTIRE corn w/ a loving amount of cheese. They also have the SALSA station which I LOVE!!! Their fresh Pico de gayo & jalapeno salsa is the Best. 

This place is definitely on the top of my list for taco places. This LOCATION I must say... also possibly tastes a bit better than the eastern location."}
{"text":"MARIACHI BAND!! 

Twas my first time hearing a real mariachi band live which was exciting!! Monday night & it felt like it was a weekend party Fiesta ahahhaahah.... came here with an infant which was probably not a good idea because it scared the crap out of the little one... they are quite loud so Mommys maybe bring some ear muffs for them or something. 

The interior had high ceilings & everything seemed very spacious lyrics spread out for seating with booths towards the entrance & hightops on the sides with tables in the center.
There are different stations to order your food from which reminds me of cafeteria style. Clean & neat salsa condiment bar in the center of the room.

All the employees were very helpful.... especially when we looked like lost 9th graders that enter a high school cafeteria for the first time! 
Each station is labeled with different kinds of items such as mulas & tacos... burritos & seafood.... gran tacos & sides
The service here is fast & everything is made before your eyes then you slide to the next station or the register if you are done receiving your food.

MULAS - pretty much a taco sandwich made from flour tortilla instead of corn. I like it with the extra cheesyness  & the softness of the flour tortilla.

CARNE ASADA TACO - this is a small taco like two bites & done 

QUESO FRESCO GRAN TACO - vegetarian selection, but the Gran Taco is the typical taco size with the cheese melted between the 2 tortillas 

CORN ON A STICK - that mexican street corn lathered in the butter & drenched with cheese... they are definately not shy with the cheese which I believe is the best part of mexican food!

CHIPS & GUACAMOLE - love the chips since they are made there & the guacamole full of flavor

JIMAICA DRINK - this is HONESTLY the best JIMAICA juice that comes closest to the ones that my BOH kitchen coworkers used to make it when they brought the dried plant back from mexico! Dark colored and BLAST of flavor!

The salsa bar is one major thing that will probably keep me coming back over & over ahahaha"}
{"text":"After all the hype my husband and I and our two friends finally tried this place. Now we see what everyone was talking about! The ordering was a little confusing but the cook explained everything to us and even let us sample a few meats. I ordered a couple tacos, rice, and corn...and oh my it was delicious! I meant to take a picture but it looked so yummy I totally forgot! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Solid tacos, quick service & authentic vibes! Tacos were on point, I'd definitely recommend the al pastor & pollo. The chorizo tasted a little funny, so that didn't meet my expectations. But the rest were great! Nice, simple taco shop - gets the job done and quick service."}
{"text":"Killer Tacos from Outer space! Not really Outer space. Just Pecos and Tropicana. The tacos are killer though.

I'm intrigued by Taco Taco because:

MUSIC: It's really loud and goes from Red Hot Chili Peppers to some hardcore Mexicana shit that brought back memories of a booze cruise in Cabo wih ten professional surfers, jungle juice bong and wrestling masks. GOOD TIMES.(Donkey were not present on the booze cruise.)

CASHIER: She is a darker version of Shakira, dresses really stylish and either wears a jewel or has a flippin piercing in her forehead. Whatever the case I think she looks like a gypsy and it's awesome!

SALSA BAR: Yes, this salsa bar wins and then wins again when the other salsa bars are checking their smart phones for tips on how to win. The salsa bar has over eight different salsas, carrot/onion mix, peppers, limes and other shit I know is there, but didn't reach for. It's always clean and well stocked.

FOOD: It's all about the tacos. I've only done the carne asada and it's pretty bomb. They don't destroy it by slopping on a fist full of guac. either like another taco shop on E. Charleston across from the old Macayo Vegas. Tacos are $2 a pop and full of meat. It's a deal. The burrito? Not so much. I swear it was $6 for the carne asada burrito and it had more rice and beans nonsense than meat. Stick with the tacos, add chips for $1.25 and head on over to the buffet of salsa. 

Overall Taco Taco is a solid taco option for people near this area. The staff is friendly and fast and the restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating and the tacos are the best in the neighborhood. Ideal spot for a quick lunch or a long romantic one with your special whorechatta or lil' bambinos."}
{"text":"This place is the best tacos place I've had in the US. No competition.
They have tons of meat options as well as a salsa bar. This place is amazing and you just have to try it."}
{"text":"This place is probably my new favorite taco shop in Vegas. Everything I've had was tasty. Even the vegetarian options are full of flavor. Everything is prepared fresh in front of your face!! The staff is super helpful and go out of their way to make sure you're getting good food. The al pastor tacos I had were overstuffed!!! If you like funky cuts of meat, this place is for you. They have brains, tripe, beef head, and a few others I forget. But not your usual taco fillings for sure. I'm not adventurous enough to try a brain taco, but maybe you are. :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their soyrizo tacos. It's very vegetarian friendly and you can grab a beer too. Tons of salsas to chose from and you can help yourself to black beans and limes etc. Fast friendly service is almost guarenteed!"}
{"text":"Tacos are excellent. Elote's toppings were good, but the corn was soggy. The salsa bar is nice, great offerings...just wish it was located away from the lines. It's a bit confusing to understand where you stand for what you want to order if it is your first time. I enjoyed carnitas and barbacoa tacos, both meats were well seasoned. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered catering from here for a friends baby shower... Three separate people found HAIR in the guacamole... They were all 3 short straight black hair... And as it was a shower with all women... All of who had long hair... It was definitely not any of ours! Have tried contacting with no response back as of yet! DISGUSTING!!"}
{"text":"Last night instead of going to Taco Bell we opted for something a little more civilized. We both had the corn on the cob Mexican street style this is a must if you're coming to this establishment. Next we had a burrito each, mine with barbacoa and hers with carne asada. If you're not extremely hungry two people could easily split one burrito and then grabbing your corn on the cobb and you'll be just fine. The salsa bar here is really good. They have roasted, sliced jalapenos which are not for the faint of heart and the avocado cream sauce goes well on just about everything. We got ours to go but on my next trip I definitely want to try the Margaritas here the ambience  is quite nice and I love the shopping plaza that it's located in because it's convenient to everything."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is amazing! Fish tacos to die for; grilled cactus is awesome; the Asada and Carnitas delectable and the Al Pastor is mouth-watering! Handmade tortillas,too!! Staff is awesome!

12/30/17 - try the Mushroom tacos! They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town hands down. I've been to lots of taco spots but this one takes the cake. It's a really spacious restaurant, it gets super hectic on weekends but the line always moves fast and I've never had trouble finding a place to sit. 
My go to tacos are al pastor, the fresh pineapple on top and avocado crema is out of this world. I always get elote as well, you can never have too much queso fresco. I've actually never had a bad taco from here. If you're feeling adventurous the lengua and beef stomach tacos are amazing. 
For drinks I either get horchata or a margarita. There's nothing special about the margarita, drink service is fast. Their horchata is really good but I can't drink more than a glass because of how sweet it is. 
Their salsa bar has a wide selection of salsas, as well as having black and pinto beans and fresh veggies. I always load up on radishes and cucumbers."}
{"text":"Al Pastor tacos were good but the Pollo and shrimp were extremely salty. The elote is definitely a must-try! We went on a Monday evening and they had live music. That was a plus! It got your hips moving a bit. ;)"}
{"text":"I've tried all the meats and the meat I thought I wasn't going to like as much ended up being my favorite one. Crispy tripas tacos! Don't knock it til you try it my friend. crunchy meat with all the dressings with a ice cold beer. Winner winner chicken dinner all day long. staff was very friendly too and helpful with all my questions. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointing with food and service! As we were ordering the cooks obviously we're talking bad about us, I don't speak Spanish so they continued to talk with each other and then looking at us and laughing. The food was burnt, corn on the cob had black parts in it, all of it didn't  taste good. The cashier roller her eyes because I told her there was a spill on the floor. The music is very loud, difficult to even speak. Over priced, and a waste of $30 on 7 small tacos, 2 burnt  tostada and bad corn on the cob...  I don't recommend this place to eat!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and service! Got two steak tacos for under $5. Good price, good food. First time here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time, maybe ever. Smells like death when you walk in. Crowded with not enough seating. Horrible customer service. Lines all over the place without any direction as to where you're supposed to stand, so that people end up cutting in front of you and you stand there waiting forever without getting served. The cooks take forever. Basically the place is my worst nightmare. Never again. Just awful all around."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing Al Pastor tacos! Slow roast pork sliced onto handmade, freshly grilled tortillas, topped with cilantro, onions, guacamole sauce and a bit of pineapples.... YUM!

It's a cool hipster, cafeteria-style restaurant so head over to the right side and grab a tray. Then order whatever you desire at each specific stations (al pastor station, tacos station etc.). Proceed down the line and you'll come to a salad counter where you can order other fixings like mexican street style corn! When you get to the cashier, that's the end of the line.

Don't miss the fine stuff in the salsa salad bar. Their hot sauces are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I was initially planning on taking my gf to tacos el gordo on the strip, but she didn't want to drive that far out for lunch. 

After looking around on Yelp, I came across tacos y tacos and I am glad that I did. When we got here, we found it to be extremely clean and well decorated. It is located in a huge plaza with tons of parking space and tables for seating. 

As far as the food goes, the carne asada fries/nachos were alright. The tacos were much better with the al pastor taco being my favorite. My next favorite was the pollo tacos and then carne asada tacos. In comparison to tacos el gordo, it is not quite as good, but it's definitely a good second. 

I would definitely recommend this place to people who don't want to deal with the hassles of tacos el gordo, which is further away, has longer lines, and has limited seating. This location has a salsa bar with a wide variety of salsas and sauces. It is kept fairly clean by the staff... I may have accidentally dribbled some sauce on the counter... I'm sorry!"}
{"text":"The best part of my day: after my job is eat three or four Tacos De asada and one Beer in Taco y Taco !!!! OMG 100% make me happy!!!"}
{"text":"Two story taco palace serving up some pretty decent Mexican fare. 

It was Tuesday and I was obligated to eat some tacos which led me to TyT. Upon coming in I was quite impressed by the restaurant itself. Very nice two story building with high end finishes featuring a market style set-up and a upper level dedicated to large parties with plenty of seating. 

While the restaurant is much nicer than one would expect, the tacos are pretty average. I had the al pastor and the carne asada  I felt that both meats were lacking flavor. They have a large salsa bar which is probably there to compensate for the bland fillings. Even for street tacos I found the portions to be really small. I could easily have eaten 5 of them and at $2+ a pop, the $ adds up. Not a bad spot but I'm probably gonna have to find a new taco Tuesday spot."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with these tacos, especially the Al Pastor. It is always good. The value is very good, three tacos for about $8."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco in Hendo is truly the Best!! Put it on your list of \"Must Try's\" 
Once you walk in the door you step into a cozy \"front polar\" choice of seating ranges from arm chairs to tables and chairs 
As you head toward the main restaurant, aromas of beef chicken and spices swirl together with Latin music in a wonderful combination 
Join the line of happy foodies as you absorb the decor and you realize that the menu and setup is like a \"taco truck\" venue Each line is designated for a specific meat choice 
Must Tries: authentic corn on the Cobb w/ mayo cheese chile lime \"the works\" 
Any taco - made your way 
When they have live Mariachis Also anything from the bar; Pitcher of beer or Margaritas, Shot of tequila You name it 
You will notice the staff is hard at work making sure your dining experience is a great one 
Make sure your ready to chat with the owner once your settled She is beautiful and friendly and gives you the most warming invitation to join her again soon 
Try it!!!! You'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Have ordered carnitas, al pastor, asada, barbacoa tacos and all have been delicious. They are other meats I'd like to explore. I ordered buche but the Ordering process is confusing that after i paid and sat down I realized I didn't get the buche taco that I wanted. Service has been good. Tacos have been the most authentic I have found around here.  The corn on the cob \"Mexican style\" is super delicious (a must have). 

I would give it 5 stars but I think they need a better ordering process besides these stations."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour 5pm -7pm daily $5 for 3 carnitas taco. Chicken nachos. It actually tastes good. $3 corona light,  $4 house margarita and $5 house wine. 

Regular menu looks good too. They have this street corn and Vampiro!!! Friendly staff and bartender. I like it here."}
{"text":"From L.A. and these tacos we worth the trip off the strip. My recommendation, Carne Asada and Al Pastor. Authentic Mexican food. Salsa Bar gets 5 stars too!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, the initial thought was that it was nicely decorated and had a cool concept...went downhill from there.  There were no definitive system for customers to line up in and the employees were far from being friendly...they were unfriendly and rude - no greetings or even a 'how can I help you?'.  Yes, the signs do say 'line 1 al pastor', 'line 2 carnitas...', and so forth but customers around us didn't have a clue hat the process was, line formation interferes with the salsa bar, and if you're up - you proceed to the 'line' that is open even if you don't want the meat that is in that line and can't proceed to said line to order a different meat from a different line.  I specifically ordered al pastor tacos with onion and cilantro ONLY - I got everything on it and the employee proceeded to tell me it is what I wanted pushing the plate towards me and rudely told me if I don't want it he can probably make it again...  I just told him no as it felt like I was already inconveniencing him, he proceeded to wrap my plate up while talking about me to another employee in Spanish.  One, I understand Spanish and two, even if I didn't, it's obvious when someone is talking badly about someone else.  Paying for our food, was not a different story either.  $2.25 for a taco about half the size of an appetizer paper plate is still expensive.  Two stars, for concept, decor, bar option, food item varieties, and flavor of food."}
{"text":"Best Al Pastor tacos in town! (even better than El Gordo!) always ask for pineapple slices!

Chicken, Chorizo & Carne Asada are all amazing as well. if you are not sure which one you like best ask for a sample!

I have been here 3 times! this place is legit. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I would have never heard of this place had it not been for Yelp and my Yelp mentor. The reviews were favorable, so we gave it a shot. We entered through the back door which was a little confusing, as I had never been there and was a little turned around. Enter from the Pecos side and you are golden. I got the carne asada nachos loaded with everything. The small was plenty for me and I can usually pack it away. The meat was tasty and all the other ingredients were fresh. The guacamole was good and they have a nice salsa bar. I would rate Taco y Taco three and a half stars, but have no problem rounding up, as half stars aren't an option. The staff was friendly and offered samples of different meats and the warm cinnamon and milk drink with the funny name."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Everything tastes fresh and authentic. I love the carnita tacos with pineapple, horchata, carne asada, and the elote (Mexican corn). Ordering is a little confusing. There are different stations for each meat so it can be a little chaotic but just grab a tray and get in a line. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. Especially when it's Real Mexican food and this place is great. Been to a place similar so we tried the al pastor tacos and burrito. So good! All the salsas were great and spicy, also got the Mexican style corn and my boyfriend inhaled it! Can't wait to try the quesadilla , bowl and vampiro , it's far but worth it !"}
{"text":"Taco y taco is good.... i still prefer taco el gordo.... but lets start with the menu.. the tripa tacos very delicious.. the chicharon tacos man that got me all pissed off i thought it was real deep fried chicharron.. not the chicharron that i can go to mexican store and buy in a Styrofoam  container..... come on you could have had a 5 star but dont offer the simple chicharron.. make your own give it some flavor... every thing ealse was good.. place is clean and well taken care of...

Health wise please put a cover on top of soda machine.. i see you put ice and over pack it .. i dont have a problem with that.. my problem is that ita right under a vent so what ever blows down goes straight into the ice...."}
{"text":"Another point for the EASTCYDE! I had to check this place out because of all the positive reviews. I'm now a familiar face at Taco Taco Mexican Eatery.

This place has a very similar setup like Tacos El Gordo, but has a little more variety on the menu, a nice salsa station, and is much more spacious. 

I like the fact that you can order rice bowls, burritos, and grandes tacos from their menu. I tried their rice bowl with the al pastor. I was hoping to get the al pastor straight from the roasting spit, but it was taken from a container from that station. The rice bowl was okay, but I know it could've tasted better if the al pastor was freshly cut off of that beautiful stack of heavenly marinated pork. The al pastor burrito was alright also. It had pinto beans and I think rice. I can't say that I was a fan. My all time favorites are still the regular $2 al pastor tacos topped with pineapple. While waiting for my order, I'm checking out the tripas just chillen in the next station. The homie cuts me a few samples. MMMMMM grimey. I ended up ordering a couple of tripas tacos also. Soon after getting your order, you will find yourself at the salsa station. There is quite a variety of sauces to choose from. Their pico de gallo combo'ed with their other hot sauces is the winner. Don't forget to get some onions and peppers at the salsa station. I was hoping to see an Orange Bang on tap in the establishment. They didn't have my favorite drank whenever I'm eating tacos. They did however carry the Mexican bottled Coca Cola. Sugar sweatened Coca Cola tastes just like how it used to taste like when I was a kid. 

All in all, I really enjoyed stuffing my face at Taco Taco. Another great brick and mortar taco shop to spend my money at. SATISFIED!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas filled with flavor they pack in the meat and guacamole onions are on point definitely try their corn salsa is great too little kick this is a must try

Kitchen is open so you can see everything lots of meats to choose everything looked clean"}
{"text":"I would give it 5, but the quality/style changes depending on who works.  

I like to get either a rice bowl or a burrito.
The meats we choose are Carnitas, Al Pastor, Lengua.
They also have a delicious vegetarian mushroom type option I get if I am not feeling up to anything at all greasy.

I love the steamed corn.  They have a Mexican version I haven't tried with mayonnaise and cheese, but  I just don't want to know if I like anything that adds the calories up even more.

Good and Bad:    The tortilla is good quality, large, and the burrito is plentiful.
I have to ask for it the way I like.  Cheese melted on it first then the other ingredients.  if you don't ask it may come a different way each time.

Issues:  I have gotten Lengua 3 times.  Once was lean and perfect.  Two other times it seemed almost like the skin was left on or it was way overcooked with chewy tough edges and was inedible.  I had to pull the meat out.  So, I just don't order this anymore.  Not worth the chance of receiving the bad version.  I guess you could ask to taste it before they add it.

The carnitas is different depending on who works too.  Sometimes it is GREAT meaty bits with a delicious flavor and other times it includes large globs of FAT with NO MEAT attached.  I mean come on.  Totally gross and puts you off the food.  Now I try to ask for lean.  Didn't seem to make a difference last time.  Had to pull the fat out of a burrito.  So now I have been ordering it as a rice bowl more often to make it easier.  Very very sad that I have to even think about this.

The Al pastor has been good each time.  It is best when they cut it up into smaller pieces.  

All the other items are good quality.  I never see any old looking items or even avocado that has turned colors even.  Nice job.  Let's work on the meat consistency and trim the fat off please.  
I love the fresh bar with cucumbers, peppers, and all the salsa choices.  Yummy."}
{"text":"I think this is around the same price as Tacos El Gordo. I also think it tastes the same but Taco Y Taco might be a little spicier. I'm not a big fan of spicy foods but I can still tolerate the spice level. 
We went here before heading to the movies on a Friday night, and there was hardly a line which is great because if we went to tacos el gordo, there would've been at least a 30 minute wait in line! We went went for a second round."}
{"text":"Street tacos...but inside!

Best tacos ever? Yeah I have to say so. They have every type of meat and style that I can think of. 

Ok, so the store is laid out in stations for different types of tacos/food. Start near the entrance furthest from the dining area and start loading up your tray with anything that looks good.

I recommend to get the mexican style street corn, a vampiro if you've never had one, and definitely the al pastor (pork on rotating spit) tacos. One of the guys there even gave me a slice of beef tongue (lengua) to try and it was awesome. I would probably get this on a taco or even a vampiro next time I go. 

The only downside is that the tacos tend to get pricey because you want so many. But it was worth it. Thanks to Suzanne O. for showing me this place!"}
{"text":"Taco y Taco I lurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrve you! I was skeptical when I saw you were in a strip mall in what looks like an old Smith & Wollensky. I apologize for misjudging you. OMG breakfast burrito I've ever had and omg the lengua and the salsa bar, and omggggggggggg I want to swim in the horchata! 

I grew up in Denver but live in New York and I never get real Mexican food anymore. It's like you knew exactly what was missing in my life!! 

Even though I am far away I promise never to forget you and to visit you whenever I can! xoxo"}
{"text":"We love this place so much. It is right up the street from us . We are from San Diego so ofcourse we are very picky when it comes to our Mexican food. This place has become our go to place. The food is so fresh and absolutely amazing. The carne asada tacos are one of my family's favourites. The food is so Good that we had an out of town guest stay with us from San Diego and he literally ate there every day ,and declared it the best Mexican food he has ever had. So there you go if you want exceptional Mexican food Taco y Taco is the place to go."}
{"text":"4.5 stars: TACOS! Came here as an alternative to Tacos El Gordo and the line went much faster - went on a Saturday night around 8 and had my food in front of me in seven minutes. Highly recommend getting a vampiro - it was my first time having one and the crispy shells are so satisfying - and also a sleeper hit was the fish tacos, which is light and fresh grilled whitefish.

The al pastor is the real star and you should hit up that line repeatedly and often. I also had the buche, which wasn't as tender as I've had before and also quite salty, and the suadero (always pleased to get brisket) tacos. I wish they had horchata or an agua de fresco on site but the grapefruit Jarritos went down easy, and you can get craft beers! Nice atmosphere, a little sterile than I'm used to for tacos, but that's not a bad thing as you really do feel like you can linger and get some more tacos without worrying about parking or crowds."}
{"text":"I came in with my family because the location is convenient and they advertise a lot. The ordering process is too confusing. The staff did little to help me understand how to order, so we walked out. There are far too many taco places and restaurants in Las Vegas to be confused while hungry. Especially since there are great restaurants all around this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, they seriously have the best elote I've ever bought at a restaurant, it was juicy and delicious, not dry like most other places. The asada taco was delicious, there could have been more asada on my asada fries, and the line is kinda long to wait in. But they have a great variety of toppings and sauces. Normally I can't get avocado because it's always mixed with tomatoes and onions, which I hate, but here you have the option to just add the avocado. The design is amazing, doesn't look anything like a taco place. And they have modelo on draught. Awesome place."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the customer service. It's HORRIBLE! I use to come here often because I liked the food, it was close by etc. after not coming here for awhile when I finally did go back, the guy who is usually in the area of the fries, bowls, burritos station is always just RUDE! The first time it happened I let it go, figured he just had a bad day but I really didn't appreciate his eye rolls. The second time I came back which was months later, same thing but this time every time he said something to me it was with an attitude. Today, he was practically yelling at me because I didn't understand Spanish!!!!! I knew beans when he asked it in Spanish but the rest I was like what does that mean and he just yelled LETTUCE and rolled his eyes and shook his head. It pissed me off because the people before me he asked what they wanted in their bowls all in English. Rice, black or pinto beans, lettuce etc. I know I won't be going to this location again, especially after that nasty attitude. Tacos aren't great. I mainly just come for the chicken fries."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had... But I have to update from my last review. It actually makes me sad to do this but my experience last night must be put out there. Here we go...

Came here last night around 7pm to grab some shrimp tacos (3 to be exact) and 1 shrimp burrito. The guy who took my order didn't speak a word of English, which is to be expected but not understanding the sentence \"3 shrimp tacos on corn tortilla\" isn't acceptable. 
So he starts the shrimp on the grill grabs one tortilla and says \"what it\". I remind him it's 3 tacos. He looks confused and had to ask someone what I was saying. He says ok gets three tortillas. He had to remake the first one 3 times because he kept putting the wrong thing on them. The shrimp is done and he puts exactly two shrimp pieces on each taco. When I've been here in the past there was always at least 6-7 pieces. When I try to ask him about this he shrugged. I decided to try and talk to someone else. He then proceeds to mess up the buritto as well by putting guac on it which I said no to. I get to the cashier and it got worse...
I walk up and attempt to explain my situation to her, I even show her the amount of shrimp on my tacos. She laughs, snatches my debit card out of my hand and charges me right away. It was $20. She charged me for the tacos he messed up and the guac on the buritto. Now the money is not the issue here, it's the fact she laughed and literally took my debit card from me without my permission. I did not sign the receipt so I will be filling a statement with my bank. 
This was unexceptable. I have never been treated like this as a passing customer and I will never return."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for the excellent bar staff. I've been here a few times since opening. My friend absolutely loves this place  like ranting & raving about them... Until this visit I thought they were ok, about 3-4 stars.... But they just secured that final star and I'm so glad I waited to review. 

First my only real complaint from the first few visits was that it was really difficult to find out what kind of meat I was getting on my tacos. I'm allergic to pork, I know, I know The Horror! Anyway, my pork allergy puts me on edge when I don't feel confident the cooks understand what I mean by \"I do not want any pork!\" 

I had been complaining to my bf that if only they could update the signs to show what kind of meat.... And low and behold they did! Yay! It is was less stressful for me to order and try new things now. 

We decided to sit at the bar, and what a treat! The bar is small so if you ever get the opportunity, I say grab it! The bartender (completely forgot his name - cute young, hipsterish kinda guy) is awesome. He's fun, friendly and very funny. He made me this delicious pumpkin pie shot... Yum! Consider me converted."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst. Not because of their food, which smells amazing by the way, but for their ridiculous lack of service. I'm legally blind, and going in here was a cruel tease. I wanted to eat here so badly, but the logistics were unclear and not disability friendly whatsoever. I was so clearly in need of help that a patron, not an employee, offered to help me. I was so frustrated at that point I just had to get out of there before I made a scene. (Sorry, friendly stranger.) Let's be clear, even without a disability, the process for getting tacos here is absurd. There are three lines, and depending on the taco you want, you stand in that line. So if I want one from each line, I'm standing in three separate lines to complete my order, not counting the register. I hate that it was so obvious how lost I was, that a customer, a Good Samaritan, had to show pity on me and offer assistance. I'll never be back, you guys really disappointed me today."}
{"text":"Kinda like Tacos El Gordo, but cleaner and better!! Go for the Happy Hour and get 5$ Chicken Nachos and 4$ Margaritas (which were both amazing) The Al Pastor tacos were delicious, Lengua and Cabeza were yummy as well. Such a great bargain for those looking to save some money while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok, I understand that going to a Mexican restaurant on cinco de mayo is going to be busy, but for the love of God, do not serve raw pork (nacho/ burrito line) to your customers! Also when a customer is waiting 20 minutes in line for a taco, make the extra effort to take the customers order not just send said customer to a different line to wait another 20 minutes for food. Kind of sad when a customer has to walk out and drive to the nearest del taco to get some food at a reasonable time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. 

The ordering lines are a bit confusing. I had the Al Pastor taco and burrito so I had to stand in Lines 1 and 4.  Reminds me of the DMV hahah."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos honestly anything you get is really good i love the pastor tacos the best. The salsa bar is great. There corn is so good and there guacamole is so good you won't be able to put it down. It's hard not coming all the time"}
{"text":"This place is basically like a higher end Tacos El Gordo. Super tastey food, nice selection of things you can add to your tacos in the center of the restaurant, and everything! The best part? No long lines, tons of seating, and (for whatever reason) less than half the amount of people that fill up Tacos El Gordo at night. 

This place is a far from me, so I won't be able to come here often, but whenever I'm in the area and hungry for tacos, this will be my place to go to!"}
{"text":"It's about time I write a review for my favorite taco place in all of Vegas. I've been cutting out red meat but I always cheat here. The al pastor street tacos are the best thing, seriously get them. I get them with everything on it and two does the trick for me. Mexican corn and the rice are also favorites of mine."}
{"text":"The Good: 
Taco Y Taco is like a Mexican Subway. You tell them what you want on your burrito and they make it in front of you. My absolute favorite aspect of this place is that they offer vegetarian (soy based) chorizo. The food is bomb with huge portions and is relatively inexpensive.

The bad: 
At the time we went, AFTER they made our food and we went to the cashier station, they said they don't accept credit/debit cards -_- We actually had to leave our food to get cold and go find a bank so that I could take out cash. It was a huge inconvenience and it really pissed me off that they couldn't warn the customers with a sign on the door or something. Or at least have the customers pay before they make the damn food. I will say, the cashier was very nice and apologetic about it, and I appreciated that. 

The Ugly:
The way the restaurant is set up, aesthetically makes no sense at all. It's a really weird, slightly uncomfortable environment. The 'decor', if you want to call it that, is an atrocity and again, makes no sense. They seem to be pretty busy and are doing well for themselves, why not spend a little money updating the look of the place to make it palatable. I understand it's supposed to be authentic Mexican, which usually doesn't look too nice inside. But this is Las Vegas, we get tons of tourists from all over the world, and a place that looks like that would not keep tourist coming back to this establishment.

Just my brutally honest opinion. The food is very good but it's hard to get over everything else. Next time I will definitely order for pick up instead of eating there."}
{"text":"I was trying to find a place that I can say is way better than Gordo's when it comes to their Al Pastor.  It came close, but not close enough.  I order their Al Pastor and Vampiro Al Pastor. I liked everything but the mango that was on top.  It could be just me but I felt it didn't complement the taco.  The mango flavor was good, but for my taste, I didn't feel it complemented well.  I liked the Vampiro with the cheese/Pastor.  My favorite minus the mango.  I also ordered the Elote which hit the spot.  Mexican corn with the fixing is always delicious. 

With that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"Im great customer since they open few years ago. I will never complained about their great food. However, lack of customer service employee Loza work as Food Preparer is very Rude. Also whispered as A Manager. Yelled what would we like to order. As a customer we waited for him to finished preparing the pastor. In my restaurant experience of 10 years. Rudeness is not tolerated no matter what level of work positions you are in. I brought many family and friends to enjoy great food. Colleagues in business industry in Las Vegas visits this restaurant. I'm a Californian native and Henderson is my 2nd home. I'm sure will no longer bring customers in this restaurant. It's sad for someone thinks this is funny. It's not and obviously don't value their work."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the interior. It doesn't look or feel like a typical Mexican joint. It's also a lot bigger than I was expecting!! A friend of mine, who is Hispanic, told me that this place was better than Tacos El Gordo. SWEET, I'm always down to trying places especially if people say it's better than some other place. Well sorry to disappoint it was mediocre at best. 

So we'll start off with food. I got the Carne Asada Fries and Al Pastor tacos. The tacos were pretty decent and I'd say would be on par with Tacos El Gordo, if it was a little spicier. That was a little disappointment to me. The carne asada fries were completely disappointing. The meat was pre-cooked and put in storage containers on the side for the Fries station. So the meat wasn't even hot at all. It was luke warm, maybe. Maybe the fries were not enough to make it luke warm. I'm not to sure. The overall taste of it was very disappointing!! 

I was too hungry to remember to take pictures =[ oops. I'll definitely come back to try the other tacos, but definitely skipping the fries. 

Oh, it was pretty dirty. Which is really a big no no for me, hopefully they clean up. The fans looked like there were years of dust on it....yes I said years. Maybe it was a few months, but it looked pretty bad and gross to me. 

I did like the condiment bar, lots to choose from which was nice! 

The soda.....skip it, most of it was flat or tasted weird =\ ugh I hate flat soda! But the horchata was really good! 

So yup, overall it was mediocre. I'll come back again in a few weeks and see how it fairs. I always say give a place three tries before you completely throw it out."}
{"text":"The meat here is so good! The past few times we have gone we have ordered the \"mula\" which is two tortillas on top of one another with cheese (essentially a quesadilla) and they add which ever meat you want with all the dressings you want. Really good!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, fresh and tasty. Service was fast and friendly. It was late and we had a jones for tacos. THIS is the right spot! Will go again on our next late night of gambling."}
{"text":"Although I only enjoy eating the corn on the cob dish. I seriously think that taco y taco deserves some credit for how fast their service is, as well as how friendly they are. I get my food right when I order it & the environment is positive! Good place for groups & families def a wonderful place to try! 

& the only thing that set me down a notch with their rating was due to how poorly they had their signs marked on where to go. Of coarse a gentleman escorted me right to the back where I needed to order after he noticed it was my first time in there. But I recommend that they clarify that a lot better for future customers (:"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp search.....I would eat here every day if I lived in Vegas.  Fast food atmosphere but food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Following my husband's doctor appt in The Henderson area, we decided to have dinner in the area since he hardly ever comes out this way. While trying to decide on where to eat on Eastern, he remembered eating at Taco y Taco a while back. Great choice as I've always wanted to check it out. 

From the outside, it looks like a cute little restaurant but once you walk through those doors, it looks pretty amazing. Definitely not your typical Mexican restaurant with what looks more like a contemporary Italian kitchen. But still very charming. 

I liked that there were different stations you could order from. My husband is a meat eater. Since my last fish taco experience was amazing, I chose fish taco and soyrizo. 

I thought my fish taco was just okay but my soyrizo was very good. Haven't had a bad experience yet with soyrizo. 


Overall, this was a great experience - great service, great atmosphere, great prices, good food."}
{"text":"Good beer selection on tap. That alone is a reason for me to go. As a lower calorie option, you can get the tacos plain, and they still taste great. Allows you to really enjoy the taste of the meat without all the toppings interfering. The meat tastes great on its own, and you get a very good amount with every taco."}
{"text":"Went here a couple months ago and forgot to write my review! 
I ordered the al pastor which they gave me a sample of first ( omg soooo good!)
They also have my favorite thing ever here.

A SALSA bar! 
All the tacos I had were amazing. The staff was incredibly helpful ( and deserved a good tip )
If this place wasn't so far from me I'd be back every week! 
Open more locations just like this one on the southwest side of town please! 
:)"}
{"text":"Definitely more high-end appearing than other taco joints in town, but still serving pretty authentic Mexican street tacos. Prices are not too high overall for food, but probably a little pricey for tacos.

Nonetheless, the flavors are excellent and there is quite an extensive offering. Get into the various different lines to order various different foods. Everything is assembled to order.

There is also a complimentary sauce/condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite large and has additional seating upstairs.

Order at the counter, so no table service, though workers will come by to clear things off your table.

I'll definitely return when I'm craving tacos, especially since this place is so close to my house!"}
{"text":"I can't complain.  My new favorite Mexican food restaurant!  Everything is delicious!  Carne Asada, chicken and al pastor meats are delicious.  Price to add guacamole is stupid, $2+ & they are shady with the guacamole.   Its a thin layer, for $2 it should be a hefty scoop.  
Anyways, whatever you get...its good.  

I worked in the tip industry and when I didn't get a tip I would be quick to dish out a sarcastic thank you.  The cooks do the same...LOL!   

Salsa bar is awesome!  

They should give out some chips like they do at Pepes when you order in.

The owner is pleasant on the eyes."}
{"text":"This place is good but they're shady on the ingredients.  I'm a business owner, and giving a little extra to a buying customer is nothing compared to a bad customer experience.  The guacamole is $2 extra and they give you a tablespoon.  Really?  Wtf is that?  A whole avocado isn't $2.  I swear employees can be so retarded at times. 
The taco guy touched tortillas with his bare hands and then puts on gloves to cut the al pastor with a knife.  Are you dumb bro?  Put your gloves on before you touch the food.
I understand Mexicans are hard workers but their common sense lacks like a possum.

Might as well go to chipotle next time.  Their portions are bigger and ingredients taste better.  Plus the service is better.  
 
The only person smiling here was the broad cleaning tables."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable Mexican food that gives its competitors a run for their money. 

You can customize most of the food on the menu. Begin by choosing an item that you want to order and then choose your meat and fillings. Some of the meat options include  are alpastor, carne asada, lengua, and cabeza. If you don't eat meat, no worries. There's a soyrizo option. I have yet to try this, but I've heard positive things from friends who did. 

On this visit, I got the bowl and chose alpastor as my meaty filling along with pinto beans, lettuce, shredded cheese, and pico de gallo. Guacamole is $1 more, but I'd suggest getting a side of chips an guac for a few bucks because you will receive a generous amount of guacamole that might be enough for both chips and your entree. Back to my order, I thought the meat was good and surprisingly not salty. I say that because most Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas add too much salt to their food -- or not enough. Kick your food up a notch by hitting up the salsa bar. The extra hot habanero sauce is a good choice; made me perspire a bit.

Not only is the food good, but the service is decent. The restaurant is CLEAN, especially the salsa station; the staff really maintains the cleanliness of that area."}
{"text":"Was my favorite place but have gone down so much sign on the door says they open at 10 didn't open until 11 then we went inside asked for 3 different meats none were ready minimum 15 min wait for it to cook. So nothing was ready before opening will never go back there again"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite taco spot in town! I have tried over 15 taco joints (el gordo, tacos Mexico, los tacos, etc), and this place continuously exceeds the rest in service, organization, flavor, and quality of the food. 

Their meats are fresh, and since they have such a busy restaurant, the turnover is so quick! They don't double their tortillas,so you get a ton of meat and delicious stuffings per taco, well worth the $2.25. 

I have only tried their carne asada, chicken, and barbacoa. Their barbacoa puts all my beef recipes to shame!!!  delicioso!!!!

Their salsa station includes 8 different kinds of salsas, beans, veggies, and of course, limes."}
{"text":"Your average taco place. The reason I am giving it so many stars is because they have the BEST staff. They are all so nice and friendly. Another plus is the fact that they give you the option to get as much extra sauce as you want with no extra charge. All of the sauces, limes, salsas, and even beans are on a bar where you can get whatever you want. This is a HUGE plus for me because I LOVE their green avocado sauce. The only tacos I get are the pork. I will say I don't LOVE them like I do tacos el gordo but they are honestly so close."}
{"text":"Located in a sketchy strip mall location with really easy parking sits taco y taco. The yellow sign with the black VEGETARIAN lettering is what we were looking for. 
 Veggie Nachos and Veggie Burrito is what we ordered up. So amazing due to its freshness and the open kitchen was cool. Probably the first time I've ever had a veggie burrito that wasn't sitting in a pool of liquid. The mushrooms were almost meaty and really flavorful. Literally everything was tasty and fresh. I think I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Really good place to enjoy tacos. It's was a little confusing on where to go when you walk in especially if you never been, but the food was great and the corn on the cob was best it's a must try !"}
{"text":"Love the tacos here. They are amazing for a low price. Also a nice atmosphere, good food, lots of varieties to choose from."}
{"text":"Nice chill place, very clean and welcoming. Though the food was not great. Meats were flavorless, sauces too."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my taco life? I just tried some tacos at the Yelp 88xxxihibition event. They were amazing!!! I was raised on the border, and these are as authentic as they get. The tacos al pastor were...my mouth is literally watering right now. Apparently everyone else thought they were awesome, too. The line to get a taco was 15 persons deep when I was waiting for taco number two. Thank you, Yelp, for introducing me to them. I'm excited to visit the restaurant and will report back!"}
{"text":"Public service announcement! This is pronounced \"Taco eee taco\" not \"taco why taco\"... thanks. I know we're in the USA and all, but since when does being an American give you the license to be dumb?... well... OK lets not get into that. 

This is a great spot. The tacos here are traditional \"street food\" style Mexican tacos... they are simple, quick, cheap, and really tasty. Overall a very authentic feel to it all. If you have ever been to the iconic \"Tacos el Gordo\" this place is much like it, but perhaps with a bit less charm (maybe not the right word...) since the feel is a bit more upscale and less like you are in downtown Tijuana (as is the case with Tacos el Gordo). 

During popular times there is a DJ in here and they really go for a hip/party type atmosphere (full bar too - with Corona on tap... which seemed rare to me, but maybe I don't frequent enough Mexican joints)... which for me means I try to grab a spot in the other corner, because I'm just trying to get my taco on, not jam out. 

Been here a few times, and will definitely keep coming back. An outdoor patio would maybe put this place over the top for me, but it's in an already overcrowded strip mall unfortunately, so I think they have limited space to work with."}
{"text":"My first time going there and I waited for a while just to be helped. The place was pretty much empty and its like they did not see me until I walked to the front. I ordered carne asada fries from them all excited because I have never gone wrong by ordering them. I asked the lady if she can add nacho cheese on them and I would pay for the difference and she said no that they're only for the nachos, I asked once more why she can't just add it for an extra charge and she gave me the impression that the cheese is already poured on the nachos and made me wonder why would they do that? I gave up and paid $12 for the plate which in the end I was so DISAPPOINTED! it tasted like nothing, the meat was not seasoned at all and neither was the fries, all I tasted was the guacamole and the sour cream. $12 for nothing good"}
{"text":"This was exactly what I expected. I lived in south Florida for a while and they had places similar to this. I liked the different ordering stations. They were busy but people were waiting for food that was being cooked. It's made fresh to order, and it's as quick as if you were making yourself. I had the quesodilla. It was delicious. You can get sides of guacamole and pico. I'm not sure if they charge you. I also got the grilled corn on the cob. I love that. Smothered in whatever that is. With queso....me likey. I think they corn should have been boiled in salted water. It needed some salt and I think some chili powder. I liked it, but it could have been better. 
The guys working the counters were friendly and helpful. The food was quick, delicious and cheap. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"3 words.....AL PASTOR TACO'S

That's all you need to know. That's all I care about. That's all they should make.

SO GOOD. I mean, seriously, they are out of this world. I always get a flour tortilla (corn ones are gross to me) and extra pineapple.

Top that off with a cold beer, and the salad bar and man, you are in for some damn good eats.

AL PASTOR TACO'S       AL PASTOR TACO'S 
     *I am daydreaming about them now*

I have nothing left to say except, message me if you know a place that makes them as good or better. Seriously."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more stars, I would! Some friends introduced me to this place a year ago and haven't stopped coming since. I get their carne asada tacos and i'm pleased with them every single time. Cleanliness of the venue and staff's attitudes could be a smidgen better but other than that, good place."}
{"text":"Soooooo glad to get an authentic taco place in Henderson. Usually I have to go all the way to north town! The place is really nice and upscaled compared to original taco shops, but the customers here are different and prominently white so I didn't expect an authentic and rustic looking taco place. Plus it wouldn't fit in the neighborhood it is in. Personally I love that the place is modern but the food is authentic. It's clean and a great place to go eat. Prices are a tiny bit higher than in the north but that was expected. Thankful that I can go 10 minutes down the street instead of half an hour across town. If only we had an authentic Mexican grocery store near so my mom can get all her needed ingredients she drives across town for. Get on it people!! Haha"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome if you're craving quick, Mexican food for a reasonable price. I saw some reviews complaining about the line/ordering system, but I thought it was efficient. They have different lines depending on what you want to order. They also have signs letting you know which line is which. 

My husband and I split a carne asada burrito. It hit the spot. I definitely will be coming back to try some of their other items. 

The location is kinda sketchy, but inside it's nice. The person making our food was incredibly friendly, too. I recommend it if you're passing through the area!"}
{"text":"After my boyfriend was raving about this place for months he took me here for lunch today. We walked in and I immediately noticed how dirty the dining area was. There was food on the tables, food on the floor and food on the chairs and I mean like someone had a food fight with some beans! There was an employee eating a burrito in the middle of the dining area and another tending to the soda fountain so I'm sure they noticed but not one person cleaned a table the entire time we were there. The employees were super nice who made the food and were very helpful while ordering. I ordered 2 pastor tacos and the corn Mexican style. Dude I was excited for the corn because elote is my fave but it was flavorless. The salsa bar was impressive with more choices I had ever seen. There was like 8 salsas, all kinds of veggies, cooked onions, 2 types if beans and more. One of my tacos the pastor was super dry and the other straight burnt black. Sometimes you're hungry enough that it doesn't matter but this time I left half my food for the trash can, bummer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome with options for non-meat eaters and meat eaters alike!!! Unfortunately, for me, I was condemned with coming in on cinco de mayo! This place was packed... lines on lines on lines. It was a mess... challenge accepted. I had to feed 9 hungrayyy gals, ready to get lit (we're not in Vegas for sightseeing). The food was still amazing. The workers worked as fast as they could. They've got so many vegetarian options... Mexican vegetarian heaven... or pretty close. They've got salsas, pickled jalapeños, all the good fixings - self serve. I would say, 4 burritos, 10 tacos, 4 elotes, 1 burrito bowl later, we were stuffed and happy. So so happy. I can't wait to come back. Gracias from California!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Taco Taco I suggested it for dinner this last weekend. We made the drive across town and arrived around 9 pm. I could see as I was opening up to the door that nobody else was in line so I was a little nervous but with all of the hoopla and the drive over we wanted to give Taco Taco a shot. 

The signs above easily direct you to the line you want to order from. I knew I had to try the \"Al Pastor Tacos\" so I ordered 2 of those. I asked for pineapple but the worker said they didn't have any. I have seen other pictures with pineapple so they must have just been out for the day. I then made my way over to where hubby was at and I ordered a \"Cheese Quesadilla\" and a \"Asada Taco\". Hubby had already ordered a \"Asada Burrito\". You can choose corn or flour tortillas and they do make them right in front of you. By the time we finished ordering the place had filled up so we beat the rush! We grabbed our food and headed towards the back and found a pretty nicely sized dining area. There was a salsa bar with a variety of stuff. I didn't get anything from the salsa bar so I can't comment on if it was good or not. I can however comment on the following:

Cheese Quesadilla - This was priced at $2.25 and very good! It was filled with the perfect amount of cheese and wasn't really greasy. I would order this again.

Al Pastor - Priced at $2.00 each these didn't blow my socks off. It was missing the pineapple I love so much and just lacked the flavor I have had at other places. This is usually my favorite thing to order but not so much here. I will probably give it another try on a different day to see if something is different but if not I wouldn't order it again.

Asada Tacos - These were amazing. Such good flavor! I wish I had gotten more of these than the al pastor but I will know for next time. 

Asada Burrito - I didn't like this. Hubby gave me some to try and it just didn't have the same flavor as the asada in the tacos. They did pull the asada meat for the burrito from a different place then the asada that was on the grill for the tacos so I don't know if they make them different but I will personally stick to the asada tacos instead of the burrito.

They offer rice bowls and have vegetarian options. I can't say I will make the effort to drive across town just to eat at Taco Taco but when I am in the area I will stop in for sure since it is a cheap and good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.   Everything tastes terrific and is authentic.  I have tried almost everything on the menu from Al Pastor tacos to carne asada nachos.  The best part of taco y taco is the portions.  You can get a quick snack or a crazy big meal for a great price!"}
{"text":"We went for first time, tacos al pastor are delicious the same as the salsas. 
The tortillas are made in the restaurant. I felt I was back in Mexico City.
They have Corn with mayo and cheese but is the yellow no white.
staff are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable Mexican fast food in Vegas! My friends took me here today for lunch. We got soooo much food for about $40. Couldn't finish everything. This includes unlimited horchata. Say whaaaat?!!!! I had the chicken muarta and the shrimp tostada. Also ordered chips and guacamole on the side. They also have an unlimited salsa bar. My friend also got the Mexican street corn that looks amazing. I think my other friend also got carne asada fries. I can't wait to move to Vegas! There's yummy affordable food everywhere!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after my second (and last) visit. I'm from SF, so pardon me for expecting authentic street Mexican tacos & burritos. The first burrito I got from them was late at night on the way home from driving back from SF... perhaps it was close to closing time, so the reason the food was so salty and dry was because it was late and it had been sitting? The burrito was salty as hell, with no real freshness to any of the flavors. My second visit, I was on my way driving out to SF, around noon. I ordered a burrito again (easier to eat in the car). I ordered pork as the meat (which - btw the meat options for burritos are not clearly laid out on the menus - if you want a meat option they offer for the tacos, you have to look over at the taco line menus and specifically ask for it)... they offer \"cilantro-style\" rice (which - if I wanted that, I'd just patronize Chipotle) and Spanish style rice, and all the other standard burrito ingredients... but I'm pretty sure every single ingredient they have, rice, guac, pico, beans, meat, all have added salt in each. I could practically feel my skin shrivel in the desert dryness and my blood pressure rise to 180/90 about half way through my burrito. The worst part: the pork was so dehydrated and dead, they might as well have thrown shredded beef jerky in there and called it a day. Also, the burrito was pinner, and it was TEN BUCKS."}
{"text":"Kept on hearing I had to try this place!  Many kept on comparing to another taco place that is very popular  in Vegas.  Yes , yes , \" Tacos el Fatty\" !  Where to start ? I walked in and never as busy as the comparison  and the staff was to busy talking to each other instead of helping the few customers they did have.  I almost left, but another customer walked over and asked if it was my first time. (Probably my confused look) I Said yes and he explained how it all works.  Your typical taco place where you go order what you want from where you want it.   Tortillas smelled good and they taste home made.  The tacos were good, but nothing out of this world.  I would not compare as they hold their own, but  will admit the way they are prepared is very untraditional !  I've seen the local and the traditional  taquero who prepare a taco with passion and ensures it's delicious. These were more of Taco Bell style where they know they need to add this and that because somebody told them that is what it should have .  Making a good tacos is an art... Believe it or not!   The tacos de Asada were good and will admit better than tacos el fatty.  However then we come to al pastor !! I stand that Tacos El gordo has the best al pastor. The meat , the seasoning , and that green sauce makes the taco Amazing and Taco y Taco was good as the pineapple in top adds flavor  but the meat was a little cold and lacked flavor compared to others.   In closing if you are hungry and want tacos Al pastor and can't wait or don't feel like driving then yes this is your place.  However if you want a great tacos al pastor this would not be the place .  Also the place was not as clean as it could have been.  In my opinion  with the amount of employees present floors should have been spotless , fountain drink area should have been clean and salsa bar should have been up kept.  Oh not all was that bad .. The corn on the Cobb with all the fixing was amazing and I would go back just for that!!"}
{"text":"Everyone, please calm down!!! This is NOT a fancier Tacos El Gordo. Relax. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth....I know we're all excited Henderson/Silverado Ranch finally got a legit Mexican joint but this is not Gordo so stop comparing! Sorry to break the news guys. 

Yes-this is the best thing that has happened to Henderson and Republic Kitchen and look forward to strolling my hungover a** in here in my stilettos for some late night tacos...so yay to this! 

Had the Al pastor, Barbacoa, & Asada-pretty darn good! Noticed they had quite the selection in meats...can't wait to try them all. The salsa bar is fully-loaded, the restaurant was very clean and borderline fancy. (let's see how long that lasts) 

Tossing out 4 stars because the food was delicious, and would hate to see this place go anytime soon....with that said; this does not come close to TEG! (Tacos El Gordo) 

Keep it classy, peeps!"}
{"text":"This is real authentic Mexican food. The location is nice and the actual cooks are nice. I did have an issue though, the girls at the register are always rude and seem like they hate their job. Another issue, they run out of corn every time I order it."}
{"text":"Great food and workers. They are very polite and always make sure you are satisfied. Food may get messy but satisfies the stomach. Carlos helped us out and made sure we were able to get a sample before purchasing. The employees seem really great and are always helpful."}
{"text":"its good authentic Mexican food very good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is hands down the best chicken taco I have had outside of Mexico. The set up when you walk into this place is a little confusing but holy shit is it worth it!!!! For 2$ and some change you get the most packed with meat taco on a fresh made corn tortilla. The lady was literally pressing out and cooking fresh off the grill tortillas for all the people in line. Makes a huge difference in the taste compared to pre made shitty corn tortillas. I got the regular taco which is just your choice of meat, salsa, onions, and cilantro. Simple yet delicious!! Personally I like them more simple (street taco style) If you want the beans and guac and sour cream and all the other shit ,you should probably just get a burrito. If you are one to like a little more flavor they also offer a salsa bar with a large variety of salsas to add. Another perk of this place is the street corn or elotes. Not a lot of taco spots in town offer it. It's not the best I've had here but it's pretty good. The best I've had was out of the back of a van in a parking Lott. Sketchy and delicious. So in conclusion If you are in the mood for some tacos that taste like they came out of a taco shack in Mexico this is your place. If your looking for some fancy Tex mex or Americanized taco fusion or whatever else is out there you probably won't be happy with the simple deliciousness of this place. Either way try it. You probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food really is all that it's hyped up to be. Glad I read some reviews before going in because the ordering process is indeed a little confusing at first. Like everyone else explains, you simply get in the line of the type of food you want. But when it gets busy, this type of ordering process gets pretty chaotic because their space isn't conducive to long lines. 

The vibe of the place is cool and good for groups and families. They could use more help on keeping the tables and floors clean--it was messy everywhere.

Will definitely be back for the yummy food though!"}
{"text":"This place is great I love the vibe. My dads a taco caterer I know what good and authentic tacos look and taste like; these are awesome. I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place on the radio, thought it was all hype. But I was wrong! !! This place is awesome,  the atmosphere is great with good music. The al pastor nachos is what I had and let me say the al pastor is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Mexigoodness!! 

I love this place. I come here a few times a month and never have a bad meal or a bad experience. The guys behind the counter are always friendly, the food is made to order and whatever you order is always flavorful. Last night I went in and a Mariachi band was playing!! They were awesome! 

The Vampiro is one of their specials and is always a good idea. Carnitas and fresh pineapple squished into cheesy fried tortilla goodness.They have tons of vegetarian options including the soyrizo tacos. I always order them with everything on them. Delicious!! I love the Mexican corn which is sweet corn with crema, cotija cheese and chili powder. So good. The salsas are all at a help yourself area and offer a variety of mild, medium and hot choices along with beans, veggies including marinated onions and fresh radish and lime. 

I always get the horchata with my meal. By far, the best I have ever had. The sweet cinnamon milky drink helps cool down the spicy flavors of your tacos or burrito. I'm not even embarrassed to admit I usually down three cup fulls. 

Try this place out, you'll love it."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be an Irish pub but is now a street taco restaurant. It's a trendy environment with really good Mexican food. 

You stand in 1/3 lines and pick your tacos. All of them are amazing! Also try the Mexican street corn. It's so good!"}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos are friggin amazing!! Mango chutney is perfect on them. Seriously amazing tacos. The street-style corn on the cob is amazing...add a Modelo and its one of the best lunches out there! 

The building is beautiful and the atmosphere is lively."}
{"text":"first time there and didn't know what to expect, the al pastor tacos were good, the carnitas taco was just a bit dry , the meat was tender but dry even with the sauces. it's really out of our way to eat there since we live by the Red Rock, we'd go back if we're in the area.. 
We ordered the fries with the meat since some of the reviews were high on that particular dish and I have to say NO, next time I'd rather order the nachos..... everything was fine other than that.... but like I said, it's out of our way...."}
{"text":"A decent option for the east side of town. I went twice in one week. The chicken and carnitas are pretty good but the show stopper is the Al Pastor. The beautiful marinated meat gets carved as you order an topped with all the good street Taco ingredients.
Friendly and helpful staff. The music is loud and flows through the place. Sweet new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Food: definitely great. Tried tacos, vampiros, elote, and nachos.
Place: mediocre.
Staff: the taco makers were good, but the ladies in front are somewhat rude.
Price: over priced esp the elites are $3.15???! In Cali, it's $1"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(142/365) \"The Place With That Stupid Song!\"

The first and last time I remember stepping in here was at our Black and White Elite Event back in 2011 when it was Republic.

The folks at Taco y Taco have transformed this spot into the hippest looking taqueria  you'll ever step foot in. I think what attracts people here are cleanliness. location, and convenience. Taste is first and foremost to me, and when it comes down to flavor, it's just okay for me. Having Al Pastor'd and Tripa'd well over 100 times, these are my go-to fillings when it's taco time,as well as cabeza and lengua. I will say that the guys putting together your order are very helpful and will ham it up when you snap a picture!

Other good things I've seen here...the asada is done over an open flame, their tasty horchata is made from scratch and not the nasty packaged mix(free refills too!) and I like the offerings at the salsa bar. Not much of a fan of the cafeteria style ordering though, because from the time you hit up the al pastor guy, then the vampiro guy, get your burrito and street corn from the next station, then pay, then get your sides, salsas and drinks, your food will be stone cold like Steve Austin, whereas at a vendor, you order from one person, the cooks get your order out quickly, and you can enjoy your order hot, and all on one plate. To each his own...I guess...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Good food, decent prices. Salsas aren't the best but luckily the meat has good flavor. Got the carne asada bowl and was surprised by how much meat they put in there. It's worth checking out if you're having a taco craving."}
{"text":"I'm with Mike and Debra on this one....it started out good, and ended up A-OK....

Yes, they have a wide variety of things, yes, its clean and spacious, and their condiment bar is pretty cool, etc. but when we arrived here on a Friday night, I was expecting tables to be packed since there are many highly rated reviews. We had an empty dining room with only one other table.

We entered through the back and the ladies were pretty nice and helpful, and we ordered an Elote(Corn on the cob) from her. The order system is similar to Gordo's
so its not difficult navigating your way down the line. While the ladies were nice, no service with a smile from the guys, and we kept repeating our order at lest 3-4 times because the music was too loud and they had a hard time remembering what we ordered. We ordered some Nopales(Cactus) and three tacos-Al Pastor, Tripa, and Cabeza.

We liked the corn and the cactus was pretty good with the beans, but the tacos were okay. The Cabeza was pretty bland, I always request Tripa extra crispy, but this was still chewy on the inside. The best of the three was the Al Pastor. Good flavor, but pretty skimpy on the meat. Glad I tried this place though. Its okay, But you have a much better option just up a few blocks from here....ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Had the Adobada, Tripas, and Carne Asada!  All superb!  The service was excellent. Atmosphere's refreshing. Ownership is gracious. Definitely need to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"It is a neat experience.  The ordering process is fairly complicated, which is actually fun! It's an authentic style of ordering, according to someone I know who lived in Mexico. Some lines are for one kind of food, and other lines are for another kind of food, and so on. You pay at the end. The view of the cooking process is fascinating and fun, almost like you are in a movie, or viewing one. The food itself is fine. The carnitas taco was really good, and the other tacos were fine. The tortillas are a little dry, but that's okay. The atmosphere is one of neighborhood families, and not tourists, but all will feel welcome.  I really like the Mexican corrido music playing!"}
{"text":"When it comes to good ol Mexican fast food this place has managed to GLORIFY the experience. Flavor is excellent, menu has variety, staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is very much appreciated. The fact that they have a legitimate bar just makes the place go from good to awesome. I'm used to going to Robertos, Pepes, Tacos El Gordo etc. These places have been put on notice. Hopefully taco y taco can come to Southwest Las Vegas, because I love this place! Highly recommend you go... The elote and shrimp tacos were my favorite thing, but then again I haven't tried everything."}
{"text":"The concept and decore are something different to offer guest. They use the freshest ingredients possible and the salsa bar gives you access to endless types of different flavors.  I gave Taco y Taco 3 stars.  To my disappointment all 3 items we order were extremely over seasoned with salt. \"Guys, let the natural ingredients speak for themself, salt is a flavor enhancer not a DOMINANT flavor.\" In addition, 80% of the cheese on our carne asada fries was unmelted. I look forward to eating here again in about 6 months. To give them time to workout all the bugs. ALSO, no need to tip they add a service charge to all bills!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are great.  Drinks very good.  Ordering and paying is dysfunctional and annoying, worse for alcohol.  They are ruining their own experience...I hope they survive

Oh, by the way, when I called to look into holding a birthday party, no one answers the phone...."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican food in town ! 
Tuesday's are taco Tuesday $2.00 tacos. FAT chicken tacos too ! 
Awesome atmosphere.
Friendly staff. LOVE LOVE this place !"}
{"text":"All around good Mexican food, the interior is upscale for this kind of store. The food comes out quick and is consistently good. Mucho gracias taco y taco"}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice authentic Mexican food! Its perfect! And the happy hour chicken nachos for just $5 what more can you ask for?? 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I could not get past the corn on the cob that was soaking in warm water for God knows how long.  It was tasteless and soggy.  The other stuff was okay, but I'd rather go across the street to Rio... authentic or not, it was just not worth the money."}
{"text":"I love trying new taco places but this restaurant was literally the worst taco restaurant i've been too! First off we got 9 tacos (al pastor, carne asada, & cactus) a horchata and a soda. To each their own preference but this place has terrible service and food. Their instagram pictures looks NOTHING like their actual food as well. I recommend checking out real reviews and pictures on yelp first before going anywhere new. They also didn't honor the tuesday tacos like advertised as well. ($2 tacos) 

Their lines to get the tacos are pretty cool, you grab a tray and get in line for the workers to make your tacos in front of you. But for my opinion, i highly dislike this because you have to wait 3-4 different lines to get your order which really takes more time and it gets confusing. I wish it was a simple ordering system, order and pay. It's nice they have a good option of taco meat and vegetarian options as well. (Cactus and Soyrizo) The workers here weren't the nicest but they weren't bad so nothing to really complain. When we finished ordering it came out to like almost $30 for 9 tacos and 2 drinks which isn't really cheap. I feel like for that price i could've ordered from another place and had a more enjoyable experience and tacos. But that's the beauty of trying new restaurants. I REALLY wanted to try this taco restaurant because of their beautiful instagram pictures but to be honest that's probably just at the other location not tropicana because their tacos looks NOTHING like their pictures. :( 

This location is huge, not many decor but they do have the classic bar with condiments. (Almost empty though)

My tacos were mediocre but it's soooo OILY. My Al Pastor was dripping in oil and my tortilla was soaking wet. It made my stomach so upset after finishing only 2 of those tacos. We also had the Carne Asada tacos which was flavorful but def wasn't the best and those cactus taco is a NO GO. I think cactus is more of a acquired taste and it was so crunchy and slimy and flavorless.. i don't know how i feel about this. I think i just hated it because my taste buds probably expected meat not flavorless plants lol. But it's still nice they have veggie options for people! Lastly i wanted to talk about horchata because i LOVE it but the horchata here is SUPER SWEET like i barely could taste the drink and it was like drinking warm sugar.. it was also so unsanitary because i watched her scoop my drink with a ladle from a white dirty bucket.. yeah i'm not sure if this is a place i'd like to come back to. 

I don't like writing bad reviews because i feel all restaurant have their good and bad days but this place wasn't clean, and the food wasn't good quality whatsoever. The service was passable but i'm not
coming back. I drove 30 mins to here and i won't come back there's sooo many other amazing taco trucks and places out there to go to. 

Be safe about what you put into your stomach, some
places can cause food poisoning this place was just waaay too unsanitary and food quality was super low. Check some other taco places out on yelp!"}
{"text":"Steak tacos were pretty good. Layout of the restaurant is a little confusing.  Jarritos was warm but at least they gave me ice."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this review by saying I thought I didn't like tacos or Mexican food in general. Now I know I just didn't like bad/subpar tacos. Which shouldn't surprise anyone since I tend to be drawn to the finer things in life but that's a discussion for another day. The crazy thing is this place is cheap, I would easily pay more for what we order. 

My favorites are the carne asado vampiro which can be described as a crispy grilled taco. The barbacoa taco with all it's accompaniments and the mexican corn. It's bad for my waistline so I usually convince someone to share it with me. 
The burrito- hands down the best I have ever had. 

I love the location, music and overall vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Great authentic taco place. Some items not commonly found in other Mexican restaurants. Far from my home but still make the trip. The different lines for different tacos idea is confusing but I realize this is a common method in Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and fresh. Lots of options. Had a great chicken burrito. I think there is a bar upstairs which I plan on hanging out in one of these days!"}
{"text":"OMG, reminds me of home in Chicago where you can find great food in small neighborhood locations of Pilsen or Humbolt Park. Great well flavored food served simply. The prices are super reasonable"}
{"text":"Although a bit overpriced the food itself is pretty flavorful. I didn't care for the burrito I got thought it lacked flavor but I did really enjoy the chicken tacos. Nice that is comes with guacamole without an additional charge. Also had the chicken nachos. Only thing I didn't care about that is they just sprinkle shredded cheese & warm it up. Thought they could have done better with the cheese but when everything else was added on the nachos it was quite flavorful. I like the carne asada & chicken. Horchata taste like cupcakes to me lol."}
{"text":"best el pastor tacos ever (reminds me of when I was kid and the family would go to rosarita) and corn!! want to try the vampiro :D"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 2 stars because the food was good. The Al Pastor tacos were good.  
Ordered nachos and the oven was broken, so they gave us nachos with chicken and chips. No cheese. Had to come home, add cheese and heat them up. 
Ordered multiple burritos and also tacos.  Asked for lids for salsa and she asked how many tacos we ordered. They only would give us 5 lids. These are not the normal size salsa containers, they are the small ones that hold approximately 1 tablespoon of salsa. 
Very disappointed in the customer service. Referrals are the number one thing that bring in new customers. Horrible service is never acceptable in business. 
I don't write bad reviews unless the service or the food was well below acceptable and the service in his establishment was."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful location in a great central area,however my experiences here have not been positive at all. Today was the 3rd time in a week I have came here for Elotes,not a very hard menu item at all to have available throughout the day. The first time I came at around 7pm and was told they've been out for awhile. This EXCUSE was just that an excuse. To cook whole corn takes. It a few minutes and is an extremely simple task that even the most novice cook can do. The second time was just the next day at around Noon and then I was told that they hadn't prepared the corn yet and it would be awhile before it was ready and that I could go to another of their locations. This was both rude and horrible customer service at the same time. The third time was just a matter of minutes ago. This morning I went in at 10:16 pm. I thought to myself that they possibly may not have it ready since they only opened at 10am,but I obviously was wrong in assuming that this establishment was staffed by proper chefs/cooks/or managers who were skilled and knowledgeable in food prep and having the entire menu ready before the establishment opens. Instead of being told this morning that they were out I was instead told \"The night shift didn't leave us any prepared corn\" so am I correct in assuming that if cooked food weather it be corn in this case or let's say meat of some sort of not used the day before is re-used again the next day?. If so then I really would question the food safety."}
{"text":"FINALLY. My fave taco spot is closer to my house AND THEY HAVE A FULL BAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, floor.

Cannot believe this is even a taco spot considering all the chandeliers, 2nd floor loft, and décor reminiscent of Honey Salt's brick walls.

I would write more about Taco y Taco but, nothing beats writing about it than eating it....BYE, GIRL BYE....driving there now for some al pastor and eloteeeeeeeeeeee =) weeeee weeee weeeeeeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Hubby and son loooovvveee it here!

Hahha... late night tacos for my baybay! #grub  #dgFoodie #dgChronicles #dgdayout #dg #deirdra #dsms #Tacos"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the food is really great and full of flavor! There was so much to choose from for a gluten free vegetarian. I wanted to try everything on the menu! Ordering is soooo confusing though. I think without the confusing ordering and changing to a traditional restaurant, this place would be 5-stars easy! 

There's also a small space for patio seating, and we liked that for our kids so they wouldn't bug everyone. Haha."}
{"text":"When you come here your life is officially complete. Fo'real!  Crazy good vibe, even better people, and yes you guessed it... Even better food. Bar has a great selection of beer/cocktails. And when you come here (its a case of when, not if) stay to the right and go straight to the Al Pastor line . Then grab chorizo. And then shrimp. Then street corn. Then beer. Eat... Drink. And you'll forget all about Donald Trump's crappy hair \"thing.\""}
{"text":"The worst tacos ever.  Got barbacoa and al pastor.  The pineapple was cut up pineapple core, no good. . The handmade  tortillas were hard and not good at all.  Had the mezcal  margarita and was only ice and no margarita.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"$12.00 plus for 4 tiny palm size tacos left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would have to eat 10 of those little mini tacos to feel somewhat satisfied. Nothing to see here folks, move along."}
{"text":"Best elote ever made. Their food is out of this world. The bar has many different salsas; all of which were fantastic. Every bite I ate of my carne asada burrito, I tried a different salsa. It was like having a different burrito in each bite. Lots of sides at the bar to choose from as well. Traditional veggies like cucumber, onions (grilled and uncooked). Black beans, etc. I can't say enough about the elote. It was off the hook!!! Great menu all around. A must if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so clean!!! I've never been to a taco shop this clean. Oh and the food is amazing and the salsa bar is the best I've seen. Must try their shoulder meat tacos. Mmmmmmmm. They also have the best burritos!! Made to order any way you want it! All the fresh ingredients are right in front of you. All the hype is about tacos el gordo but I think taco y taco is much better and CLEANER!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying this place.  I will say that first off portions could be a bit more considering and comparing to competition in the same field.  We ordered takeout for the following:  Burrito for my son who ordered just carne asada and cheese on a flour tortilla.  The flavor of the carne asada is excellent has authentic carbon flavor that you look for.  Cheese was a perfect amount but the homemade flavor of the flour tortilla was lacking.  My grandmother would have criticized this tortilla lol as she would have said, \"no ay no falta sabor\" meaning it lacks flavor.  I agree.  My wife ordered the asada street tacos.  To be authentic street tacos, it should come with TWO tortillas, here they serve them with one.  They are good in size, packed with flavor overall good but needs that second tortilla that I am used to seeing.  I ordered the salad, while it does come in a big black bowl like serving container, it was 1/2 filled.  The gentleman who served was, \"PINCHE\" Spanish for tightwad with the servings.  Mine was served with pinto beans, good overall flavor.  Spanish rice, lacking way lacking in the chicken Knorr flavor that I was looking for and the serving was like 1/2 a serving at best.  Chicken, again VERY PINCHE in the serving probably got 1/8 of a cup in my salad bowl, pico de gallo and lettuce.  I would give this flavor a 4 outta five stars but in portion compared to the $8 ticket price 1.5 stars at best.  Overall I probably will not come back as I can see this restaurant is trying to \"SQUEEZE\" every penny of profit from one customer than to make the volume of customers if they were to either do 1 of 2 things.  Lower the price and keep the portion servings OR Keep the pricing but ante up in portions.  Your competition does way better in this department.  I have to say 2 stars overall for this place.  Flavor is NOT everything if it only last 2-3 bites and your meal is gone.  So a burrito and large drink will set you back around $11-$12 so if you are on a budget, which we all are, this can set you back for $45-$50 for a family of four.  Adios, Taco y taco!!!!  Chipotle is cheaper and portions are bigger and Café Rio across the street on Easter is about the same in price but bigger in portions.  Café Rio does have the \"authentic\" taste in their flour tortillas that I look for and was raised on.  Happy Eating!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to call this a great taco shop even though it's much more.  They have mariachi bands every Monday.  The staff are nice and accommodating if you are new to their style of ordering.  A they have a great bar as well."}
{"text":"Def one of my favorite joints in town! :) The Eastern location is on par with the original on Tropicana, except this one has a full bar and a gorgeous interior decoration. In other words: a major upgrade!

It's about 3-4x the size of the first restaurant and includes an upstairs dining area, which is great for larger parties. The menu is the same (with the exception of the drink menu, of course) and service is still stationary, where you approach separate counters for different things, but is just as friendly. Don't be afraid to ask questions!

On special occasions, like Cinco De Mayo, they have live mariachi music & awesome specials. They also run sweet deals during their daily 5-7 PM Happy Hour and every Tuesday, aka TACO TUESDAY! Which has $2 al pastor or chicken street tacos, $2 cheese quesadillas, & cheap drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in town!

I usually order their carne asada tacos & elote - both of which are DIVINE - but occasionally, I'll mix it up & order a few carne asada vampiros instead. Paired with a glass bottle of Coke & some flan, you can't go wrong.

With several people working the grills & other stations, service is always quick & easy - as long as you know what you want before approaching the counter. I highly recommend stopping by - whether it be at the Tropicana location or the one on Eastern, which has a full bar & a larger dining area."}
{"text":"This place rivals Gordo, but is less crowded.  The carne asada mulas, and the carnitas mulas are amazing!  My friends like the corn on the cob also!"}
{"text":"From my guess, this place seems pretty authentic. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but you get the hang of it.   Stand in front of the type of vessel you want....taco, burrito, nachos, etc. and choose your meat.  So many types that I hadn't heard of before but don't be swayed if you aren't familiar. The people behind the counter are very helpful and friendly.  Just ask ;-)  We tried the cabeza, another beef, carnitas and carne asada.  All were yummy.  Next time we will try the corn and al pastor!  The salsa bar has pinto and black beans! Not to mention all the veggies and different salsas!  They serve cold beer as well :)"}
{"text":"For the past year I have been living in Las Vegas I have suffered from serve authentic Mexican foot withdrawals...then finally my savior came in the form of a gran taco. Taco Taco ahh where to I start? The taco bar?? Loaded with spicy carrots, cucumbers, all types of salsa and even beans, you can have full meal from that alone! I go to Taco Taco about twice a week and I have gotten the Gran Tacos pretty much every time, the Al Pastor is out of this world no more of this Robertos BS!. I really happy this place isn't too close to my residence or I would be there every day!. Staff is friendly even was treated to free tacos on time. Soccer on the TV, great tunes bumpin on the stereo good vibes all around hard to beat this place!"}
{"text":"This is a LEGIT Mexican food establishment.  I mean, I took 5 years of Spanish living in San Diego, so I can kinda get by, but this is a place where all the workers speak Espanol to each other and I couldn't keep up!  And when I ordered in English, I felt very much like a Gringo!  Damn, I wish I had practiced that Spanish more after high school!

Anyway, let's get to the food.  They have burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and bowls, but I went for the little street tacos!  I got one asada, one carnitas, and one al pastor.

Asada: Meat was very flavorful and juicy.  Sometimes when you get asada at other places, it can by dry and tough.  This stuff was delicioso.

Carnitas: They were ok, not my favorite of the three.

Al Pastor: WINNER WINNER WINNER!!!!!  This meat was INSANE.  Such good flavor, and the sauce they put on top of it was great!  Only thing I didn't like was the chunk of pineapple they put on top (I really hate pineapple), but it was ok cuz I just gave it to my husband.

Tortillas: I have a big problem with corn tortillas because they always split in the middle when you try to pick up the taco and all your innards get everywhere, but NOT HERE.  These tortillas held it together and were nicely toasted.

Salsa Bar: 1 salsa? 2 salsas?  No. SIX salsas!!!  And there was a smoky spicy one that's the kind that's so spicy, but you can't stop eating it because if you stop your lips will burn so you just have to keep eating it!!  A good burn.  Also, there were carrots and even beans at the salsa bar.

Ambiance: The restaurant is very large, very clean, and they even had live entertainment singing.

Too bad this place is on the East Side, a good 30 minutes from my house!  I want that al pastor meat every day!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that giving star ratings gives me headaches? Like I don't know how many stars they deserve! There should be like an alternative rating.. Like love it, like it, gotta try it?! Lol

I'm not sure what happened, but I'm going to have to say that my friends over hyped this place for me. I went with my friend Ryan, and let me tell you know that Ryan is very particular with food. He's a hospitality major, so customer service is also on Ryan's priority list. 

Tacos were okay. Don't get al pastor/adobada. Don't waste your time. It's nasty. A good side was that there carnitas is on point. Try it on a mula (quesadilla like with extra goodies inside and your choice of meat!) $4 but pretty tasty. 

Okay.. Biggest disappointment.. The vampiro. It was supposed to be the deal breaker from the recommendations I got. Yeah, no. Totally burnt tasting. Why? Cause they burnt it! 

Ryan and I were thinking.. Maybe it was an off day..? But then we thought, tacos el Gordo doesn't have off days. So we decided it was their fault, in which it rightly is. 

Oh, the salsa bar is pretty sweet. One problem. No labels. Thanks for the mystery taste adventure, but if someone is allergic to one of those sauces .. It won't look good later... Unless you're bored or don't have enough gas to get to tacos el Gordo.. Then walk or take the bus.. Skip this place if possible!"}
{"text":"This place is located on the left (north) part of the lot and this is probably one of the most heavily trafficked lots in Henderson.  If it is I'm sure this restaurant is one of the main reasons. It's 7pm on Saturday and its a PACKED HOUSE. Don't worry you'll get a seat upstairs or downstairs. There's even a party of about 20 celebrating something. It would be cool to sit near the railing to look down on the chaos. 

Yes its chaotic here. The inside is as huge as the outside lets off. There are about 4 separate lines for things I have never heard of. I had to ask a couple of regulars what was what so I knew where to stand. It looked like one line but I guess one line was just real popular.  This is where I deduct a star. It could be better managed. Maybe have a greeter direct newbies or good signage but definitely a better system of ordering. I was waiting along the salsa bar the whole time I waited and inevitability was in someone's way haha. The lines or the salsa bar need to be rearranged. I suggest it be put against a wall but I couldn't tell you where.  It definitely looks like mass confusion.  When it came time for me to get my salsa there was someone in line in MY way lol. For anybody that cares it's colder upstairs then it is downstairs and they carry liquor. 

They have Barbacoa but not just that. There's like 3 or 4 types of beef I've never heard of lol. There's also like 3 or so types of pork.  I guess I'm saying you'll have meat options.  The place definitely gives off a factory vibe where they are pushing out tons of product. I do have to say they are efficient with the food.  The food is definitely good and the salsa bar is also good but both aren't excellent and could be improved.  My wife thought the Carnitas were flavorless but the Barbacoa had plenty of spice.  The value is excellent and the choices are OK.  Overall I would say this is a good place to eat and with a few tweaks here or there it could definitely earn five stars from me and I'm sure others as well. 

OK I'll shut up now"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Docked 1 star just because they usually do not have great service. Some of the cashiers are not friendly and they talked to each other a lot and does not acknowledge the customer right away. 

If it's your first time here do not be confuse! You basically walk up to the station of which meat you want in your tacos or go straight to the other station that they have (I seriously thought you had to go through each station until you reach the cashier but one of the staff told me you don't have to, so don't be like me. lol) 

Everything is good and the portion is great. They do not skimp out on the meat and everything is just so flavorful. My favorite to get are carne asada tacos, al pastor tacos and elote. I also love that they have a self serve sauce bar in the middle of the restaurant. I usually bring friends or relatives visiting from out of state or country and they like this place as well. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Decided to go with some coworkers and finally try this place. The moment I opened the door I could smell the meat and spices (mouth watered). From there I got in line, if you have never been here there are separate lines based on what you're going to order. For instance, carne asada, chicken, burritos tacos etc.

Overall the food was great. Each of us got different items and share. Thhe meat had great flavor, the salsa bar had a lot of variety and it looks like we may be back for Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I was really sad when Republic closed because it was a place I would frequent often for brunch. However, I will go on record to say Taco Y Taco is worth no longer having Republic. I love Mexican food in every form of the word and I am never disappointed when I come here. The street corn and Al Pastor are my favorite by far. My only wish would be that they would give the place a makeover because their attempt at decor is just cheesy. The space has great bones and the potential to be a very chic place. But for now as long as the food stays how it is I will absolutely come back, time and time again."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I tasted your tacos... it was at an event. It was outdoor, so even after a couple hours the tacos and sides were still warm aand tasted freshly made. I later found you were in Henderson ! Not your typical white walled cafeteria looking taco spot , which is a nice change , and you.still.have the same kind.of prices but better.taste ! the meats are juicy, toppings fresh, I particularly recommend.the barbacoa and carnitas . The bar is what I'll try  for my next trip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Fresh, authentic and delicious.The atmosphere is different than other Mexican restaurants and it's refreshing. The staff was helpful and excited for us to try it out too. My coworkers and I definitely have a new lunch place and I will be trying their catering this week as well :)"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in Las Vegas if I could give them more stars I would. Fresh ingredients they have the best cabeza tacos in the world I would highly recommend trying them"}
{"text":"Grande taco shrimp is the best.  I recommend this authentic Mexican destination to all of my friends and family.  Huge Returant with many places to sit.  Great salsa bar."}
{"text":"Always awesome and always a good idea! Incredible draft beer selection as well. The micheladas are homemade and amazing. This place is ALWAYS a good idea!"}
{"text":"One emoji to describe this place: 

The tacos de al pastor were amazing, as were the Agustin frecas."}
{"text":"Such a great place. I highly recommend the Tacos al Pastor and street corn. The environment is great and the drinks are fantastic.

The line system is tricky. But don't let it deter you. Just line up in front of whatever you would like and then take it to the cashier."}
{"text":"The sopes are off the hook!! 

I couldn't find some Mexican food that would taste like something I would buy in LA but, this place is bomb!  It's like the true Mexican chipotle lol"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy and so pretty! I had 2 al pastor tacos with pineapple and my boyfriend had a huge burrito al pastor as well! Both were delicious! We both also had the Mexican style corn on the cob with mayonnaise, cheese, and powdered chili! I had a michelada (cause they also have a bar) very spicy but super good I loved it all! Customer service was superb  all the workers make conversation and are so smiley which makes it seem like they're happy you are there and there's nothing better than that! I recommend this place 100%!"}
{"text":"My friend SWEEEAAARSS on taco y taco and how Tacos el Gordo is crap compared to this place. I thought it was just alright.

When I came to try Taco y Taco it was on a Sunday before we headed back to California. It was empty and we were the only ones in the restaurant. This is what I liked about Taco y Taco over Tacos El Gordo, no lines! They have the same line set up as Tacos El Gordo, except it was only 1 person working all the stations. 

I ordered a couple of tacos, asada and al pastor. I also ordered the vampiro which was really greasy but I enjoyed that over the tacos. The asada was dry and the al pastor was just alright. There was plenty of tables and seats to settle down in. The salsa bar was fully equipped and stocked! 

This isn't a place I would write home to and probably wouldn't come back to because it's kinda out of the way. Overall, I'm not sure how I should trust my friend's taste in tacos."}
{"text":"Great food reminiscent of the street vendors, taco trucks, and little \"holes-in-the-wall\" that are so good!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Las Vegas about 6 years ago I have tried out so many Mexican restaurants ranging from chained ones Roberto's,Fausto's, and Don Tortaco off the strip to ones on the strip like Javier's,Cabo Wabo, and Pink Taco.I have been to some of the best Mexican in Southern California that it has to offer to the best of Phoenix and San Antonio.I have tried out many Mexican food on wheels in a trailer all over as well but Taco Y Taco is right up there at the top with the best.

Tonight I went in and tried out many of the different meats and for a second I thought I was in heaven just like the first time I tried out Texas De Brazil. The El Pastor is very good and delicious so I had to order 2 tacos to go of that meat. The next meat I tried was the Pibil and I was just blown away with the flavor so I got me 2 of those tacos to go as well. Lastly I wanted to test out the chips so I ordered me some Nachos with those 2 meats tried out.They have a huge salsa bar which has many flavors from mild to very hot but just a great variety.

When I got home and tried out everything I ordered I can say I was very pleased and impressed with how everything tasted.Anyone who loves good Mexican food will appreciate this restaurant and needs to give it a try.I will go out on a limb here and say this place beats many of the restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Don't sleep on this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Taco Taco Taco Taco Mexican Eatery. That's what this place should be called as I would like to eat that many tacos here. 

I have been a couple times now--once getting tacos and once getting a burrito bowl. Both times I had the scrumptious al pastor--I would steal that thing and eat it on the curb like a corn on the cob. Actually I know that's gross but I still would. 

The salsa bar is where it's really at, though. There are about six different flavors that I would drizzle on cereal for chrissakes, but the real winner is the green with the little bits of avocado in it. It makes everything taste better. Are you having a horrible day? Eat the green salsa with the little bits of avocado in it. Did you just get dumped? Eat the green salsa with the little bits of avocado in it. The first time I went with Dana S. there was a woman who was literally stealing the salsas and saving them for later. She was asked to leave. Hey, I'd steal the salsas too."}
{"text":"The tacos here are truly heavenly. So much flavor, especially the al pastor tacos. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The worse service ever. The meat was literally swimming in a pool of grease, cooks weren't wearing gloves when preparing the food, drink station was all torn apart and the salsa bar was a complete disaster. As we entered the front door there was a terrible odor like someone vomited all over the place. Outside garbage everywhere and even some cupcakes laying on the floor. Stood in line 10 minutes without being acknowledged. Will never step foot there again"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home and I'm glad we did. The ordering process is a little daunting but you get the hang of it after ordering your 5th taco  My husband, sister and mom loved all the meats and way they were cooked, I asked for veggie tacos and the lady piled them high (grilled onion and bell peppers) along with guac, cilantro and raw onions. They also have Mexican street corn and they did not disappoint; it's basically sweet corn, mayo and parm with paprika. Love LOVE this place! Also the people are SUPER SWEET! They noticed it was our first time and helped with ordering. Thanks Taco y Taco staff for a wonderful breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food:  4
Eastern's Taco Y Taco is the exact opposite of Tropicana'sTaco Y Taco and not in a very good way.  Although they serve the exact same food and the same price, Eastern's serving/portion sizes are substantially less than Tropicana's.  The staff here are less friendlier too.  Snotty is a more appropriate characterization.  Customer service sucks worse than an inoperable vacuum cleaner.  I've been here twice and my second visit was worse than the first time.  Although Eastern is way closer to me than Tropicana's, I'd rather drive to Tropicana's to really enjoy all that is best from Taco Y Taco.  Suffice to say, the 2 star is for the staff and the customer service.  This Taco y Taco spot took over what was once Republiq that took over another establishment whose name I don't remember.  All the previous occupants were short termers and didnt last, and  Eastern Taco Y Taco is deemed/doomed to follow the same fate!"}
{"text":"One of the local taco joints in Vegas. However, they're overpriced and struggle with cleanliness issues. Their ordering system needs some better organization as well. 3 stars for the decor and al pastor."}
{"text":"I love the lungua tacos but I've had them all its delicious plus the  corn is  great on the cob I've never ate in but always had it to go with all the salsa and fixings really awesome food must try."}
{"text":"Legit Taco Time! This place does super great tacos. I would say it's the best tacos joint on the east side. It can get pretty packed at peak hours but that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Really like this place as it's different to other Mexican places in this area. They offer a wider range of menu items and the staff are very friendly and helpful. My favorite has to be vampiro style (I probably spelt it wrong lol) but it's really unique. I highly recommend going here for brunch with friends. It has a great ambience and everyone seems to be welcoming. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Came in one day to try the place as recommended by a friend.   Perfect combination of fresh, cheap, and tasty Mexican food.  It has become one of my favorite restaurants in town. 
PS
The lengua is a must have."}
{"text":"Taco y taco...more like no bueno y mas no bueno!

I've never been so disappointed in street tacos before.  I've heard so much good about this place I decided to try it. The corn tortilla was too tough to start with.  I got 3 different cuts of meat to get a good taste for the place. Carne Asada, Lengua, and Barbacoa.  The carne asada was super tough, not juicy at all.  The barbacoa was super fatty.  And the lengua was just eh.  Not a fan of any of it.  The salsa bar was ok but when I asked which salsa was they hottest the worker didn't even know.  I don't know if I went on a bad day or a bad time but the fact that there was only 1 table in there at 6:30pm should have been a sign.  

Pretty safe to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of two places I go for el pastor! Amazing grace. We frequent here for the tacos, burritos, nachos and mexi corn. The service has been on point!"}
{"text":"Over priced not the best tacos and they charged $2.00 to cut a corn in half. But I guess that's what you get for getting tacos in Silverado Ranch."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place and when I went everything looked good. It was busy and people were enjoying their food. I went at about 8pm, I want to say. I ordered carne Asada fries. The guy cutting the carne asada was wearing a black hat, glasses and had a beard. He was cooking raw carne asada and a customer asked if he was going to wash his hands before putting his chicken tacos together. Well he went to the sink, wiped his hands off with paper towels. He did not wash them. And put on gloves. Then he finished making a chicken taco. Yes he put on gloves but he still handled the outside of those gloves prior to putting them on. I would not recommend this place to anyone. On the bright side, the bartender had great customer service and was polite. (My 2 cents, I think this place needs stricter policies and a strict supervisor.)

Ps the lady behind the counter at line 4 who does the salsa and sour cream is not very attentive or nice."}
{"text":"The tortilla chips are the best I have ever had! The guac and salsas are good, too. The mild salsa isn't so mild in my opinion but I really like it! My fav thing to get is the al pastor pork vampiro. I love it! The sauces on it are good as is the crunch of the tostadas. I have had it with and without the pineapple and I like it both ways. I tried the chorizo taco and it wasn't for me. The horchata drink is good - a refreshing quench after some hot salsa. I will be coming back! 

Mmmm chips and salsa....."}
{"text":"Comparable to Tacos El Gordo? Definitely a yes! Great customer service and friendly staff. Try their sweet potato fries with chicken - absolutely amazing. And their Al Pastor tacos with pineapple salsa - to die for. I'm glad a great taco spot opened up on this side of town. It's about time! Also their horchata tastes like Christmas in your mouth."}
{"text":"These are my favorite tacos/tostadas in the LV Valley. Authentic LA style street food at its best. The ordering lines are confusing and a bit chaotic but once you have your food, it's well worth it. Love the chicken Vampira tostadas best, crunchy & flavor packed goodness. Excellent salsa bar with both black and pinto beans for you to serve yourself which makes it reasonably priced to me. No meat added to the beans is a big plus. Rustic & so delicious, not to be missed if you're a fan of this type fare. Quesadilla was the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"The best taco joint in Vegas!  Awesome salsa bar. The food here is seriously legit.  Loved all the flavors, the salsas and the smells. Impressed with the food and cannot wait to go back again and try some different things!

The place was very clean, the staff very helpful and the salsa bar was on point.  Great atmosphere and great food!

I love it!!! 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has awesome authentic street Mexican food. The location is perfect and the atmosphere inside is great for conversation and they have bands and happy hours as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great vegetarian options and delicious food. Pretty authentic, but not your typical style mexican restaurant. Kind of trendy, you order at the counter everything a la carte. Pretty nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I honestly had to write this review, this place totally deserves it. First of all the food was amazing,  customer service is the best. I came earlier today with my girlfriend and had forgot my ring in the ladies room, the girl (Janet) went and searched for it 3 times till she found it and kept it for me .. ring wasn't valuable but was an important souvenir.  Anyways, I got here and they welcomed me again and gave me these corona rings and sunglasses and they were very extremely friendly... this is the new spot for me.. thank you very much"}
{"text":"Always love this place only downfall is there isn't one by my house smfh lol and too far from me but I love there food pretty close to tacos in mexico..."}
{"text":"Incredible tacos, great people, they will help newbies if you are unclear about whats going on and will let you sample the different kinds of meat. Sit at one of the 5 stools at the bar and they will bring you food! The mixologist (Omar) is incredible and the spicy margarita it too good to be true! Definitely the best street tacos, and an authentic Mariachi Band on Monday evenings 6-7pm."}
{"text":"I've tried over 30 taco restaurants and trucks all over Los Angeles and San Diego plus three awful places in New York City and NOTHING tops Taco y Taco in taste. The prices were $2 at the Tropicana location 2 years ago but increased to $2.15 last year and meow $2.25 this year however the inflation in prices is more than reasonable. You will not find a nicer taco restaurant in America. The bathrooms have automatic towels and marble sinks with nice flooring. The venue has high ceilings and very spacious plus a full bar with numerous beers on tap, liquor and unique beer bottles. The other location is also clean and spacious. Plenty of salsa, lime, radish, onions and peppers to add on."}
{"text":"Compared to other reviews, I've had better luck with service at the counter or maybe my expectations weren't as high as others. It IS a very casual dining experience, people! This restaurant is very chill and the experience is the food. Every time I eat here, service improves. 

There are two separate counters; one for just tacos and one for everything else. If you are ordering nachos, don't wait at the taco counter because you'll be wasting your time. The taco counter is the first one you see when you enter. 

I think this is the best Mexican food in Henderson!!! How they prepare and cook their meats are authentic as you can get. They have the typical meats, like carne asada and barbacoa, but if you are a foodie-type person I highly recommend tasting the chicharron (pig skin) and lengua (beef tongue). You must get their Mexican-style corn on the cob too! My boyfriend loves their barbacoa nachos."}
{"text":"These street style tacos are delicious! The pastor with pineapple and carne asada w/ guac and handmade tortillas are my favorite. They have a little bar area and a set up for a lounge type at night, but I have only been there for lunch. The setup is a bit confusing since you have to go to different stations depending on what type of taco you want, but the staff is helpful. I think tuesdays they have taco specials."}
{"text":"This my new favorite place for Mexican food. Very authentic. The pastor is their specialty and it's amazing. The Mexican style corn on the cob was a mind blower too."}
{"text":"I love this place. We ate there for the first time and was blown away. Very authentic food. The pastor and carne asada were unbelievably good. The have a full bar which is cool too. The ordering procedure is a little different - you order dishes at individual stations and then it is prepared while you wait. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"OH these are good tacos!   Freshly made tortillas, corn on the cob on a stick, el pastor, yum yum yum!  It is comparable to Tacos El Gordo, except not in the ghetto!  Yay!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican Street corn and Lengua tacos. Carnitas were OK. I went late at night with my family (10pm) on a Sunday night. Relatively empty, but good food. Hot and fresh tasting. But and all the salsas you serve yourself were empty... luckily if you ask they do give them to you. But for some reason it's really hard to get limes. Like the first time I asked, a guy went into the back to chop some up for me and gave me 1 lime. But then my mom wanted one and then they said they were all out... uhhhh no you're not out of limes sorry haha"}
{"text":"Good food and good customer service. What more could you ask for? Why are you still reading this? Get over there and see for yourself. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So glad my boyfriend found this place! Everything is fresh and made to order. Having never been before I was confused on ordering but the nice lady behind the counter directed me that each station has different items and you go to the ones you want. Mexican street corn so yummy! Everything is delicious but my favorite is tacos al pastor. Also they have homemade horchata and hibiscus drinks! This location is very clean, just look behind the cashier counter and you will see what I mean. Also I tip each person at the stations I go to!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! It was my first time here. We a sat at the bar, had a couple cocktails, and then ordered two rounds of tacos. Loved the carnitas and chicharron (pork skin) and marinated pork with pineapple salsa was my favorite. The corn on the cobb was a great ending to our meal...yum!!! Eddie took great care of us! He was patient and took the time out to explain the menu to us. Thank you for making my first experience a great one! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was awesome and friendly. Foods were great and so was the drinks. It gets really packed on a Friday afternoon which i am right now.."}
{"text":"The tacos are a real treat, especially the al pastor chicken tacos. The beer menu is a bit slim but still palette pleasing. Don't skip on the salsa side station. There's some good stuff going on there. The service was great, very very helpful in explaining everything. All in all I will be coming back again and again...and I'll be bringing more people along with me."}
{"text":"Al Pastor is much better than the carne asada for sure. I didn't venture out and try any other meats. 

4 stars for a few reasons:
-carne asada was just OK. Maybe 3 stars. It wasn't very flavorful and was a little tough. 
-corn was really undercooked. I've had better corn at the fair. 

Pluses:
-horchata was nice
-parking wasn't terrible
-clean inside
-avocado sauce is  
-free beans!"}
{"text":"This is no tacos El Gordo sorry pathetic ass soggy tacos al pastor subpar with more pineapple than meat if you want the real deal go to the real place and skip the train wreck called tacos y tacos"}
{"text":"Mmmmm.....delicioso!!!! I come here pretty often and it's always the same. Great, fast, simple, and delicious! Just some bomb a** Mexican food and beer. Al pastor vampiros are the best. The asada tacos, well I bet you can't just have one! I always get the elote with everything, and you must try one of their micheladas. Oh and be careful cause they are spicy!! Also make sure you try the grilled onions and peppers they have at the bar with all the hot sauces. I would also say try every taco. I think they are all good. Love that it's quick and cheap too! They have a full bar and have a Dj on some nights! Cool spot to hang. They have an upstairs seating area as well as outside seating. Definitely a spot to try."}
{"text":"Well I am from the Texas and this kind of food is popular there and taste very different. I have to say I was not impressed by the food. I think there is a few things they could do to make it better, but hey everyone had different taste right! Well I had the asada tacos and a Mexican corn. I just don't think there was enough flavor. Service was excellent. The prices are good for what they have. I liked it but I wouldn't brag about it. They do have a wide selection of taco meat. You be the judge!!!!"}
{"text":"I must say that I was really disappointed!

I have eaten at many Mexican food establishments over the years!

I thought the ordering system in place was very difficult to understand without asking many questions.   It made both me and my friend feel stupid!   

I ordered 3 tacos and extras and they were bite size and I felt like I was eating hors d'oeuvres / appetizer!

As we were eating, I looked at my friend and asked where is the main course?  He said, you are eating it.  LOL  I said, I will need more food for dinner, I'm a beefy Italian.  LOL

For the price of the food, and the bite size main course, I do not recommend to go."}
{"text":"I was heading out of town to drive to AZ, and hadn't had breakfast or lunch, yet. Didn't want a sit down heavy meal, so I was going to go to Einstein's. But I saw Taco Y Taco come up on my Yelp searched, so I popped in to check it out.

The place looks visually clean and awesome. The opposite of all the hole in the wall Mexican places I was brought up on in San Diego. But another Yelper said it was the best tacos in Vegas. So I had to give it a shot.

The guy that helped me was super friendly, letting me sample three of their meats even after I had already ordered the 2 he recommended. Great customer service.

The tacos weren't very big and were $2.25 each, so they're about double what I want them to be priced at. I almost gave them 4 stars due to the price, but they were so friendly I have to give them 5.

Oh, and there was a DJ spinning in the restaurant when I was there. Only in Vegas, amIright?"}
{"text":"Delicious food but it can be chaotic and confusing for your first time. There's multiple stations to order from, it can be really loud during peak times, and most of the menu is in Spanish. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Other than that, love the Gran Tacos, Barbacoa street tacos, and the Corn on the cob served Mexican Street style is the best!"}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars due to the food being delicious and the employees being very nice BUT the way you must order your food is highly confusing.  If you order tacos - you order in this line - but if the tacos are vegetarian - you order over here.  Burritos get ordered over there and if you want nachos - you go over here.  Very strange way to order.

They also need to come up with a different plan on cooling their venue.  Their a/c does not cool the room enough to make it a comfortable experience.  I would go back though just for the food!"}
{"text":"Just aye okay in my proverbial book. And honestly just barely that. 

My book that already tried the adobada, asada, camarón*, carnitas, pollo and the horchata at Taco Y Taco. 

*Dollar up-charge means it will be 50% than a regular taco

Maybe I am getting too old, and less hip, and more intolerant for tomfuckery. 

Ordering model is fucking ridiculous. All restaurants I have experienced in Mejico were sit-down, so I am uncertain if doing it in such a chaotic way is keeping it authentic. If it is, they should stop. If it is not, they should definitely abandon it. (Make it historical.)

To add an anecdotal regarding ordering:
I asked this female employee for a camarón taco. It was in her section. Then, the dude that was preparing some of my other tacos in another section asked her. When I reached her a second time (Note: no one else was ordering from her at the time), she had not made it, or thought about making it, and imagined she would be making it in the near-future. I had to practically plead with her a third/fourth fucking time to prepare me a goddamn taco. Seriously?

How one orders is not the only absurdity at Taco Y Taco. The music is blaring so goddamn loud -- not to mention their choice of what to play is obnoxious -- one would think that one was at the food village of a fucking major music festival and not a restaurant in Henderson. Nevada. (Turn that shit down.)

And the food: it is merely \"A.OK.\" Vastly overrated by the looks of the average rating for this place. 

Rating: \"A-OK[,]\" although barely that."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great salsa choices and wow vegetarian food. Definite bang for the bucks and the food does not specifically says gluten free, one can select options to avoid gluten...
Very fun Management with energetic atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Horrible Concept! That is unless you like standing in up-to FIVE different lines to get & pay for your food which inevitably gets cold while you wait. Service sucked to the point that we were ready to walk out. 

Food was good (Pastor was best) but the tacos are tiny.
No chips & salsa for the table.
I don't mind paying a little extra if it's really good but unfortunately Taco Y Taco doesn't live up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Walked into a vibrantly decorated space and was greeted with a smile saying how can we help you. Ordered a Mexican corn, chips, and two Al Pastor tacos. The Mexican corn was wiped down with mayonnaise, rolled in cheese, and the dusted with paprika. Wow, tasted amazing! There was a choice of eight different salsas to choose from. Was a great addition to accompany the chips. The tacos Al Pastor had great flavors and the meat was mostly meat and not fat like some other taco places in town. Tried the Hibiscus fruit drink that had a tickling sour punch to it. The manager showed me around and offered suggestions. Great customer service that created a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Holy crap. We are from Los Angeles, We were looking for a good taco spot and we found It! This place is amazing. It's busy and yes a bit messy, but I cleaned my table and ate away!!!! We were a party of 16 and everyone was pleased. Definitely coming back when we return to sin city!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for Mexican food. Love the fact that they have different choices for the tacos. My favorites being chicaron and al pastor. The nachos here are also really good. Portions here are great and they even got elote to top it off."}
{"text":"Really good tacos!! Al Pastor is really tasty!!! They shave it off right in front of you to make your tacos. The guac is bomb and tastes just like mine when I make it at home. The elote is also bomb. Venture off of the strip and check this place out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great deals on the tacos, quesadillas are especially great. Love coming here and i'll always be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend during lunch. There was a bit of a line on a Wednesday afternoon. Clearly, a lot of businesses come here to grab a quick bite to eat. Now, I have heard about this place from other people. I've seen the beautiful pictures of elote (corn smothered in butter, cheese and spices). But sadly, the food did not taste as good as it looked in the photos. 

FOOD: We had the chorizo taco, carne asada taco and elote. The chorizo taco was extremely salty, so I do not recommend this for anyone. The carne asada was dry, did not taste fresh at all. Even adding some sauces to the mix did not make the tacos tastier. The elote was okay. They smothered it in butter mix, sprinkled some cheese on it and chili powder. There was something missing in the elote, For sure it was the best thing in my meal, but I would not come back to try again. 

PRICE: I felt like it was overpriced for the quality of food I got. For two people, it came out to $25. I should've driven farther to enjoy El Gordo's instead or even Roberto's. 

SERVICE: Service was okay. The people were nice and they gave me what I ordered within a timely manner. 

I give this place a 2-star. If you come here, I would recommend getting the elote, but don't expect a life-changing experience. 

Happy Dining, 

J Tran"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best taco ever had in my life! I'm a vegetarian so it's hard to find a good taco but here they have a soy version of chorizo and it is amazing! They also have a wonderful tequila selection. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had in my life.  The tacos are absolutely wonderful.  I have tried all of the different meats on the tacos and you can't go wrong.

The corn on the cob dish is absolutely delicious.  I get it every time I go now.  Best Mexican place in town and has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Man I love this place! Went for the first time the other day and I will definitely be back.. ALOT lol. Plenty of choices, flavorful items and a great atmosphere! Oh and my favorite part, free refills on horchata which was soooooo good."}
{"text":"The food was good and so were the prices. 2 tacos for about $2.25? Of course I'm buying! 

The exterior and interior of the place is classy. White walls with dark brown accents separates taco y taco from other regular Mexican places. It's very spacious. They have an upstair where you can overlook the restaurant.

The only thing I didn't like was the service. I couldn't hear the workers when they were talking to me and I waited for 20mins to order the corn, only to find out that they ran out. Sucks right?!

 Running out of food should never be an option in a restaurant; hopefully they have already fixed that problem. I long for better customer service, also."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when I saw the place from the outside, but wanted to trust the Yelp ratings. You people are right, this taco joint here was great. Tons of choices in meats, tortillas are made there, tons of toppings, and the guys in the back making the tacos just seem to enjoy life and their jobs."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night and I was lucky enough to meet two friends in the parking lot.  They led me through the process and made it easy for a Taco y Taco newbie to order what I wanted.

The staff was super friendly and I soon had two tacos--one al pastor and one of their Vampiro.  I also got an elote--the first time I've had this at a Mexican restaurant.  I am a fan of this street food for sure.

The tacos were good.  I got everything on the al pastor and the pineapple tends to overwhelm the rest of the taco.  I also dumped a fair amount of their hottest salsa on, so tasting for details wasn't too much of an option.  I got the Vampiro with carnitas.  The server grabbed a large piece of pork that was simmering in some nice juices and sliced away to put in the Vampiro.  This was very tasty and I'm glad I got it.  As for the elote, I really am a fan.  The cotija and then dusting with Mexican chili powder make for a great taste combination.

Last night was Mariachi Monday and there was a Mariachi band playing in the foyer and just inside the restaurant for about the first hour I was there.  It did make conversation a bit difficult but it added to the atmosphere.

The restaurant has a partial second floor which gives you more options for sitting.  However, when you forget something, like getting a drink and some plastic utensils, it's down the steps and back up again.  Better to get your hunger on a bit more.

As I said before, the staff was really great!  They'll ham it up and pose for any photo op you want and they are helpful in answering any questions.  The ladies at thew register were just the same.

This really was a good stop for tacos."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for quality Mexican tacos! I recommend this place to everyone! My husband and I have LUNCH dates here! we love how big the place is & it's never crowded or too loud like other restaurants! You walk in and get in the line you'd like to order from. Each line has different meats all fresh off the grill cut & chopped before your eyes! Tortillas are fresh & hand made! If you don't want soft tortillas they have tostadas instead! Their is a build your own burrito/nacho/salad station and street style corn!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, homemade tortillas, fresh salsas and elote. Nice people and great deals on beer buckets during the games. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I got a sever headache for hours after eating here which leads me to believe they must have a lot of preservatives in the food. I've had this similar reaction in Asian restaurants where they still use MSG, which is a preservative. I suspect there are preservatives, but I could wrong, but I'll never eat here again because it's just not worth a pounding headache if you react to food preservatives."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas. For sure. Get the Chicken tacos. And ask for flour tortilla. Not about that corn life."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Henderson Location on Eastern so when I started getting hungry and the nearest vegan eatery was already closed, I decided to give this location a try.  

I was sorely disappointed.  The front staff were not helpful when I asked about Vegan options So I proceeded to order the veggie burritto.  She made a comment under her breath about not having many vegetables, but I had no idea, they had been around some time!!   Instead of telling me the veggies were not fresh , she put them in my burritto.   The onions were chewy and completely dried out and the burrito was slightly warm when it was served.  I was treating my niece for lunch and hers was also just OK and slightly warm.  Since these were not edible as is, we took them home and  proceeded to add a few more fresh ingredients and pulled out the dried veggies and threw it to broil.  After a bit of doctoring it was much better.  
I totally wasted $20 bucks for lunch...I hate to waste food, but  on second thought I really should not have eaten it and made my own lunch from scratch.  
Will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"My girl friend referred me to this place.  Thanks Woman!  They had me at Al Pastor street tacos.  Yummy!  Love that on the spinning roaster thingy, shaved to order, and the fresh chopped pineapple touches.  There's also a salsa bar with extra fixings.  To the owner... Can you please open another one in So Cal?  Thank you"}
{"text":"Besides the amazing food, the customer services is also great. Every person I've brought here loves the food and later asks for the name of the restaurant & cross streets so that they can come back again."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. Fresh food. Everything comes right off the grill. Excellent customer service. Full bar. Live music and nice decor. Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great food. Very confusing for a first timer on where you order but really authentic food"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero I would.  I was so looking forward to eating here and it was tragically bad, the al pastor tacos disgusting with a capital D and why was there pineapple? Seriously? Then the shredded chicken was so tasteless Taco Bell makes better ones.  I won't even describe the al pastor burrito no words can.  the nachos looked so good but then it wasn't good not even my son who literally eats anything would eat it.  Makes me so sad when you pay good money for food that should have been thrown away what a waste and we are still hungry!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The thing that is a bummer is their customer service. Border line rude. I've been there a couple of times and after the first time I had a bad customer service I wanted to give them the a second chance. I was thinking the guy could have had a bad day or something, turns out the guy is just plain rude. Won't be going back. A lot of people I work with have had the same experience. Too bad about their poor customer service."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Close to where I live #1. The pastor was so flavorful along with all the different salsa options. The mole sweet potato fries were amazing, and paired perfectly with the margarita de casa. The margarita was so tasty that I had to get a second one, and could've sat there drinking them all night. I love the fact that they get all their meats and tortillas from Los Compadres which is one of my favorite carnicerias in town. This will definitely be my new taco spot."}
{"text":"This place is consistently awesome. The service is great, the staff is friendly, the food is to die for and the craft cocktails are something to write home about. I've ordered almost everything from the menu and have yet to be let down. I would highly recommend al pastor anything--bowl, taco, vampiro, you can't go wrong. The suadero is also pretty incredible. And they have a great beer and craft cocktail list. Next on my list to try is the Beach Better Have My Money but today, a Bloody Maria fit the bill. What a work of art and ay carumba this was spicy! Enjoy Taco Y Taco early and often!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time from a friends'  recommendation. We tried a little bit of everything since we live no where near here. Not sure what this place used to be. Very nice, clean atmosphere. You seat yourself. They have a self service soda station and salsa bar. 
Some of the things we ordered were the Carne asada Vampiro and tacos. I was not a fan of the Carne asada. That is my only complaint with this place. The meat had a very smokey flavor to it. I know some people enjoy that, I'm not one of them. Especially with Mexican food. Smoked meat flavors are for BBQ. 
My favorite was the Al Pastor! OMG that's a MUST! I've gotta say probably the best Al Pastor I've ever had. I wish I would have gotten that in my Vampiro instead of the Carne asada. They have all of the regular Mexican dishes. Nachos, burritos, tacos, etc. I've never seen the Vampiro before. It was two mini tortillas with cheese,your choice of meat and cilantro. Think of a mini tostada sandwich. I uploaded a pic too.
Ordered a chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. They put guacamole, sour cream and cilantro in it with the chicken & cheese. 
The CORN. Oh my yum, the CORN! 
On a stick, mayo, Parmesan and paprika. Don't knock it till you try it if you've never had it. 
Chips and guacamole were ok. I like fresh guacamole. Theirs is pre-made and portioned in the fridge, ready to go. 
I liked all of the different salsas they have.had to get an order of chips to try them all.
 They also have pinto and black beans at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"The asada tacos you can't go wrong with. Salsas are too watered down, no taste and not spicy whatsoever. All the other tacos like pastor and suadero aren't all that great."}
{"text":"The most Authentic carne al pastor tacos in Vegas.  Fresh, juicy and so tasty. If you like Mexican food then you'll really like TACO TACO.

 Great staff, extremely clean place and quick service!"}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco is a hidden secret. If you like Mexican it is the place to be right now there are dollar street tacos today. It is amazing place. Has live music great food and it is spotless. I would come back anyway. Come check it out."}
{"text":"Awesome, best taco place in my experiences!  Anything there with pork is money.  Ordering was a bit tricky as a newbie, but the staff was super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"By nature we usually compare new things we try to our favorites. 

I think my comparison for Taco Taco is definitely Gordo's! 

Upon seeing the lay out it does scream copycat, but looks are deceiving because I think their offerings are better than Gordo's the only point ill give to Gordo's is their adobada. Taco Taco wins in everything else.

I love Gordo's, but its always so busy! I know dumb reason to knock them, but I am happy to have discovered Taco Taco from friends.

I'd also say it's like a chipotle mixed with a Gordo's. There's a large seating area. It's always clean. The salsa bar is legit! It really is an awesome thing to have for your customers especially when you're not dining in. A label for each sauce would be good.

My first visit was during a lunch break.

I was the only person ordering and it took awhile for my food to get to me. Considering the large staff I just didn't see how it was possible. 

I can't knock them for my making my food fresh, but Gordo's is quick.

Whenever I try a new place I always go crazy ordering new things so I can get a real taste for their food. 

This is my final conclusion on their food.

I had their al pastor gran tacos which were yummy. I think the flavor is too salty, but still good. They are like a \"supreme\" taco of sorts. It's larger than their regular tacos and are packed with meat. I've also had their carne asada tacos which are good. Their fries come in full and half sizes and they also carry nachos in both sizes. You can get any meat on either. I had a bowl today that was also really good. You get a lot of choices on what you can have on the tacos. 

One disappointment was when I had a language taco their was no sauce on it. Since the salsa bar has so many salsas this shouldn't be a problem, but maybe a suggestion for which sauce pairs best with each meat? 

Overall it's a hit for me.

My only gripe with the place is that I don't like their ordering system. The staff is nice in that they don't send you to a different area they'll just tell the order to the \"correct\" person. If they found a good ordering system and a way to translate it to their customers it would make it easier for them to take orders, easier for them to serve customers, and they'd make more money in return. 

They have shrimp on the weekends, but they have run out the three times I've been. I can't wait to try them though."}
{"text":"I just moved offices and finally checked out the fancier version of Taco y Taco! I have to say that the bar and restaurant itself is such a beautiful space. Their salsa bar is also just awesome. It puts all the other salsa bars in town to shame. All of their salads also taste great by the way!

Anyways.. Taco Y Taco is a Mexican restaurant that specializes in tacos. Some of their other dishes are quesadillas, mulas, and fries! I have to say they make some pretty tasty food. Everything is always cooked well and flavorful.

My recommendations are adobada and lengua in any form. They have some of my favorite tongue in the city. Tongue on fried is awesome.

I recommend asking for extra salsa and their grilled green onions. So good!

I still stand by their sub par service and their disorganization. It's just so confusing for their customers. They need to fix that. They'd make more money and have better customer satisfaction. 

I'd still give them the okay for some solid tacos."}
{"text":"This place is a GREAT alternative to Tacos El Gordo. In fact, I think this place is much better than Tacos El Gordo. First, the actual venue is very nice. It is very clean, open and hip. I love how they have a line to separate the different meats you want in your tacos/burritos/quesadillas.  Closer to the cash register, is a bar and another line to order fries, nachos, corn, etc... 

The food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates. 

The venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food. 

Lastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is good, just like the original. Specifically, I really enjoy the al pastor and the fried fish. And the carnitas. Bonus points to this new location for the atmosphere. It's hip, but it's still \"fast-casual\" aaaand they have a full bar. Prices are very affordable ($2.50/taco, complimentary beans, $5 for a good selection of drafts), foods good, it's in my neighborhood....I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good stuff.
All the meat, beans, and tortillas are made fresh and all are good.
They have a very wide selection of meats from your standard carne asada/carnitas/shrimp to the more exotic cabeza/lengua/3 things I never even heard of! On top of all those meats they even have soyrizo for you veggie types and I overheard somebody say the beans are prepared vegetarian as well.
The ingredients all seem really fresh, and I liked the setup of different stations for the different meats (although nobody seemed to be following directions the day we were there). 
One complaint: while delicious, the 'gran taco' is definitely overpriced at ~$4.50 for fish or shrimp.
It's not super close to my house, but when I'm feeling a taco, I would definitely go out of my way for taco taco."}
{"text":"I don't about this place.. My Al Pastor tasted like deli meat.  I had three or four order of it and i still couldn't get over the idea why it reminded me of a cold cut.  I've even tried to experiment with the salsa bar and even that didn't work.  I just couldn't mask that idea out of my head.  

At least the chorizo was fantastic.  Not greasy like your average sausage.  Just the right amount of crumble, chunks, and mMmmm.  

Service was great, and staff were friendly.  Spacious and clean.

After my encounter with the Al Pastor here it is highly unlikely i'll ever return unless they offer some type of bread, then maybe.  Even the salsa bar did nothing for me.  It was just underwhelming

*They didn't specify, but you get a free mexican corn with check in.  How about some wheat toast dry instead???"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good taco shop since the day I moved out here and I finally found it here at Taco y Taco. It's only my third visit here and I can already say that Taco y Taco is \"as good as it gets\" when it comes to their tacos. At Taco y Taco, you place your order at different stations.  Tacos, burritos, bowls, corn on the cob, quesadillas...yes, they got them all that here.  I've had their nachos and quesadillas in the past and thought that they were pretty good.  But it's all about their tacos and I have them as plain as can be. Chicken taco with nothing on it.  Asada taco with nada on it.  They're so good that I don't need anything on them to satisfy me. These tacos are fresh, tasty, and very, very good.  And on top of that, they hook it up and their restaurant is clean.  If you haven't been here, then you're missing out."}
{"text":"Sweet mercy...! Please move this to the west side..!  Outstanding tacos...  We ordered one of each and chowed down.  A very impressive flavor and fresh taste. 

The chips and guacamole were very good, and don't forget the carrots and onion. 

Well worth the drive to Henderson."}
{"text":"Them tacos!!!!!!! Wow! Go get you some of them tacos! My friends and I got there 30 minutes to closing and they were super helpful and willing to serve us. And everything we got, a group of 6 people, was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Good fun and super clean.  Stoped in while getting a oil Change next door.  The breakfast burrito was really tasty and good size"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I have ever had!!!!! I recommend the Pastor Tacos!!!!! If you can get away from the Strip this is your place!!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos anywhere I've been! 
Definitely a must when I'm Vegas...
Tacos, mulas, elotes"}
{"text":"First time I came it was great but the second time my chicken taco tasted and smelt like fish and I found 2 bones in my taco, the inside is not very clean either. Won't be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"My GF and myself were looking to grab a bite to eat somewhere cheap and in the neighborhood so we gave it a shot. We both got 6 dollar burritos (chicken for her and al pastor for me). With gaucomole, we were both very happy and would come back again. The pastor was my first here in LV and I'm pretty impressed. Very clean and nice dining areea and pretty quick service a little bit of confusion due to the language barrier but I suppose that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Good tacos with lots of flavor. As a first timer I had no idea what the order process was. Very confined and staff was not very helpful. Too far away to hear a word they said. I would recommend it and would recommend the management to rethink the ordering proceds"}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I'm always on the lookout for a breakfast burrito that is worth. Well, I think I found it. They also serve soyrizo for vegetarians. Simply wonderful, the salsa bar is awesome, salsa is tasty and it seemed to transport me home. I like it, will be back without a doubt! Nummy"}
{"text":"So happy to find this awesome mexican restaurant near me in vegas. The al pastor is probably the best I've ever had. Extremely fast service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Vampiros Pastor taco is so insanely good.  Trust me.  Probably one of the best  Cheap Eat bites I've had in Vegas - ever..."}
{"text":"I've have been going here for a while. This spot is bye far one of the best spots in town. It never gets old and is always quality. El Pastor is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Unlike other taco places they aren't stingy with the meat. Our go to taco place!"}
{"text":"Was at tis establishment on 4/26/2017 about 5p.  Staff friendly.. ordered a Chicken Nacho.. at 5p the price is suppose to be $5:00.  Cashier charged me regular price of $!0:00.  Had to tell what the correct price should be. Food was average in taste.  Would help if management would employ staff who are comprehensive in the English language.  Shouldn't have to speak in Spanish  to place a food order.  Geez, really?"}
{"text":"Favorite spot for taco Tuesday! The space has an authentic cantina character. The food is delicious with the freshest ingredients and the staff is friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"This place has great flavors but, I question the freshness of the food plus every time I have eaten here by the time I get to sit down after going thru the lines and paying for everything my food is cold. It would get 4 stars if they could figure out a quicker way to get the food to you and check you out quicker. Terrible layout. It was originally a bar layout not a restaurant. It's definitely not laid out to be a grab and go food service."}
{"text":"Even though it's so close to my side of town, I never bothered to get out here until today. It's actually not all that hard to find after you turn from Tropicana on to Pecos, If it's your first time, enter from the street side to start at the front of the line and read the overhead signs to see what you can order. Go around the corner for the taco stations and try to line up roughly near a sign with something that you want, and just try to get in your full order.

Shelling out $2 per taco isn't terribly expensive for the morsels of goodness that I managed to obtain, and being able to use my credit card was a pleasant surprise. I went for the al pastor, having heard so much about it, as well as the lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head meat) because those just sound good. The al pastor had a great combination of heat and sweet, the lengua was very good aside from one overly chewy bit, and the cabeza pretty much melted in my mouth in a very good way.

This is a great spot that I plan to visit several more times so that I can fully dive into their menu. Stamp of approval... stamped."}
{"text":"I decided to celebrate \"National Taco Day\" with a tasting of sorts at Taco y Taco. Unfortunately, the results were decidedly mixed.

October 4th is one of those so-called holidays dedicated to a specific food, and this restaurant decided to celebrate it by offering all non-seafood tacos for $1.00 (normal price $2.25). Having eaten a lot of tacos at other places since my previous review, I approached this as an opportunity to try a multitude of the meats available here. The lone exception was the reasonably tasty carnitas (tender pork) because I'd eaten my fair share of those on their Mexican Independence Day celebration at the OG Taco y Taco. I would have skipped the al pastor also if my friend hadn't gotten too full too quickly.

I actually went here for both lunch and dinner, which was necessary for me to have the stomach space for everything. I was going to describe the two meals separately, but I'll list what I ate from the best to the worst (with line breaks to separate tiers). Note that not all of the options will be appealing to all palates.

==========

- Buche (pork stomach): probably the best rendition that I've eaten, bursting with flavor and juices.

- Tripas (beef intestine): about as strongly flavored as any tripas I've had here or anywhere else.
- Barbacoa (tender beef): I wonder if this has the fatty bits that are normally served with cabeza. It was pretty good overall, and I'd order it again.
- Al pastor (marinated pork): flavorful, but still not as good as one particular local taco stand. It's still pretty good, although the pineapple was a bit too acidic.
- Cesos (beef brain): distinguished by the almost creamy texture, and no sign of prions so far.

- Cochinita pibil (roasted/marinated pork): tasty marinade, but too chewy.
- Chicharron (pork rinds): this actually lacked the crunchy stuff that my friend reports usually getting when ordering it, so it was just a rather spicy, marinated, and overall intensely flavored pork. It packs a punch that I'm not that interested in.

- Pollo (chicken): surprisingly good, but chicken isn't that unique naturally, there wasn't a special marinade to lend any flavor, and most people go to taco places for beef and pork, not chicken.
- Carne asada (grilled/marinated beef steak): pretty good, but not as impressive as what I've had elsewhere in Vegas.
- Chorizo (pork sausage): served as finely ground meat instead of as a cut sausage, so the texture was disappointing. The flavor was average at best.

- Lengua (beef tongue): significantly tougher to chew than it should be, suggesting that it's been overcooked or wasn't cut properly.
- Cabeza (head meat): boring compared to past experiences with this meat, seemed to lack all the fatty bits that provide flavor and typically make it a can't-miss option.
- Suadero (a beef cut from near the udder): the one I was served was simply too dry and chewy.

==========

In addition to the unfortunate issues in various meats, I found another problem. By the time I had seated myself and readied myself to eat the tacos, I found that the tacos as a whole were merely warm and approaching lukewarm. Yep, on both visits.

I think this happened because of the inherently flawed ordering/paying system: they'll prep the food first, then you'll most likely have to wait to pay (I did wait, twice), then you'll spend more time filling beverages and obtaining lime wedges, salsas, etc., and finally you get to sit down and start to eat. My currently preferred taco joints in town ask you to pay first, then allow you to do other things while waiting for the tacos. When the tacos are ready at these places, you'll be done with all of the other time-consuming tasks, so the tacos won't be too cold. As with most foods, tacos simply don't taste as good after they've cooled down.

By the way, I'm still not cool with the prices for the standard meats being that higher than the standard $2.00. What's next, a bump to $2.50? Let's hope not.

I saw too many flaws today. I'm no longer comfortable with giving Taco y Taco anything more than a 3-star rating. I've already been reluctant to return, and based on my observations, I'll continue to limit my visits here to sales (holiday promos, happy hours or Taco Tuesdays) and occasional invitations by friends."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant may have an identity crisis, I'm not sure if it wants to be a Chipotle or a Faustos/Robertos of sorts. Either way it fails miserably. While sitting here at my table I have watched the cashier touch the sour cream bottles multiple times while the person on the line is touching them while making the food, a guy making street tacos dip something in a sauce bare handed and eat it and the bartender call a girl \"big booty hoe\" I quote. Now that I told you about the show lets talk about the food..........oh yeah nothing special there. It taste like well nothing. Nothing stood out from the burrito, the nachos or the corn."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price! The atmosphere is great. For two tacos, corn with everything, and a drink I believe I spent around $7? Our party was obsessed with \"mulas\" Lol! This is definitely a spot I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the al pastor as it's sliced to order with fresh pina and salsas! The staff are always so friendly and warm to me. I also like that the salsa bar has so many choices of salsas, pickles, frijoles and roasted veggies!"}
{"text":"I read good reviews about this restaurant on Yelp before going there - and I'm so glad that I did! I thought the food was delicious! The burrito bowl was pretty good, but what really shined were the following: el pastor tacos, guacamole, jamaica, and horchata. Best I've ever tasted. 

I brought a group of friends here to try it with me, and it was a big hit with all of us. I will definitely be going back there multiple times a month. Thank you, yelp!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best quick Mexican food around. The cook everything right in front of you and it always tastes really fresh. The blow their competition out of the water. They only have a couple locations unfortunately, but I hope they continue to grow their chain. I've lived by it for four years and hardly noticed it. It's in a plaza kind of tucked away, but I found it earlier this year and cannot stand other places now. My husband loves their al pastor burrito and tacos. I'm a huge fan of the carne asada fries and gran taco! Super delicious. Staff is always very friendly and quick! Prices are good as well. $5-10 for a meal."}
{"text":"Holy tacos al pastor. Must try. Super delicious. I love the atmosphere, prices, and everything I tried. I will visit often."}
{"text":"Before eating less meat, I'd alwaaaays come here for their Al Pastor tacos. They are absolutely amazing, especially with extra pineapples! The carne asada one is good as well, but it is definitely not my favorite. And I also enjoyed the lengua tacos. The meat was flavorful and chewy - but a good kind of chewy!

BUT A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR MEEEE, I came here because it was a Tuesday, duhhh. And I am dipping my foot into the pescatarian life. I ordered their shrimp taco, fish taco, and soyrizzo. All three of them were with pineapple, guacamole, and cilantro. I really enjoyed the shrimp and fish taco. It came with a good portion of shrimp and fish. The soyrizzo was rather salty, which weren't my favorite. 

I also ordered their elote; which I always order! It's not the best imo, but I am always coming back for it :-) I love this place because the bar has a lot of sauces and toppings for free - avocado sauce, salsa verde, three hot sauces, beans, limes, carrots, jalapeños, radish, etc. it is amazing!

Side note: their micheladas are either good or really good lol it's not always consistent. Other than that, I love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been here now several times and they never disappoint. The food is excellent. The also make a great Michulada (don't know if I spelled that correctly). Best damn tacos and street corn EVER!! Go!!"}
{"text":"The lengua is awesome,  and the elote is on point.  Also,  they serve the al pastor with pina, so good. I like the salsa bar too, the avocado dip is my fave"}
{"text":"This place rivals most OG taco joints and carts.  I guarantee you it's pretty authentic and has a flavor of it's own.  One of the few places you can get Pastor, Buche, and Lengua.  Some people find it gross.  I find it delicious.  I can't say it's for everybody but if you ever get a itch for tongue.  It's very delicious here and it's priced right."}
{"text":"This reminds me of the authentic tacos we get in California! Their Al Pastor and Elotes are amazing and I'd drive from anywhere to get these two things! Try the vampires and the tostada al pastor. The mango in the tacos complete the taste of the al pastor!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. It offers a full bar as well as happy hour specials. A lot of...um...unique taco meats to choose from as well as sides like nachos and a traditional mexican street sweet corn on the cob deal. A truly great place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Visited this place while I was in Vegas! 
 
I definitely don't eat tacos on the daily but this place is beyond good. Their tacos are super flavorful. I've tried so many of them, and I can't tell you which one is my favorite. They are all different, and each of them blossom with delicious flavors. If I lived closer, I'd definitely be a regular customer at this taco place. If you love tacos, this is the place to go. If you're new to tacos, this is the place to go. They have different types of tacos, and burritos, and bowls! I'm sure they are all delicious as my stomach isn't big enough to eat it all. I would if I could. 

Anyways, good, fairly cheap tacos! I loved them."}
{"text":"I had the al pastor tacos. They were okay. Not quite as authentic as I thought they were going to be from all the reviews. My husband had carne asada tacos which he enjoyed. We also had chips and guac. I won't ever order those again. The chips were overly salted and the guacamole was chunks of tomatoes and onion with lime and barely any avocado. 

Ordering is confusing if you've never been. There are individual lines but there are people everywhere so it's hard to tell who's waiting for what. 

The customer service was terrible. When we got to the line to check out. The lady just looked at me and then goes well what did you get? It's not hard to see. They are plainly in front of her. Not one thing was hidden. Then she rang it up and handed me the receipt, I signed and gave it back, and she just took it and didn't even say thank you. She just stared at me. Just because of this interaction I will most likely not go back. She was incredibly rude."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I think I was hoping to find a hole in the wall gem, but I didn't. 

I had three tacos and some chips and salsa. overall total was around 10 bucks. All the salsa was fresh and had I had many choices. The taco's were just okay. I have had better and I have had worst. Being that I think there are better options in the same price range I will prob go to them the next time I am looking for this type of food."}
{"text":"If you want fresh , flavorful meats this is the place for you ! Their carnitas and al pastor are amazing !! They also have a great Mexican style street corn , that is prepared to order ( as all their offerings are ) . They have a pretty big salsa bar with many fresh offerings as well ! Would have 5 stars but their ordering process is pretty confusing , as different meats and offerings have different stations and if you hit one , there is a tip jar at each one , which you kinda feel obligated to tip each one , ( I asked the guy ,he said they don't share ? ) but after you pass all the meat stations , you get to the cashier and guess what ? there is another tip jar there too!' Wtf ? Don't they pay these people ?? For food I would give 5 stars , value(about 13$ for a burrito ,corn and drink ) 3 stars and ordering 2 stars !"}
{"text":"I tried their other location and it wasn't all that great but I was recovering from being sick so I decided to give it another try. I wasn't impressed. Their ordering process is horrible and confusing. I didn't know who was in line and who was before and after me. 

The chicken taco was actually really good. The chicken was flavorful. I did not like the carne asada taco at all. Got a huge piece of gristle on my first bite and that killed it for me. Husband got the al pastor but didn't like it either. Lacked flavor. 

The Mexican corn was good but cold by the time it made it to my tray. It cost 35 dollars for two adults and four small kids (10 and under). Pricey and not that good."}
{"text":"Super cool decor and interior. I like the open order stand and variety. However, the chicken tacos were SO salty and the pastor was okay, but I lived in Mexico City for 3 years and this was nothing like the pastor there or in places like Cancun or Acapulco.  The staff was very nice though, very friendly!"}
{"text":"I would have to say I enjoy this taco y taco location over the other. It looks nice on the outside as well as the inside. There's plenty of seating with the downstairs and upstairs area combined. I love the decor and how bright and open it is. I wasn't quite sure about the DJ booth, but I guess it's hip and cool huh. I also liked the bar they offered although I don't usually partake in alcohol consumption that early in the day.

My one complaint is that they stuck the salsa bar right in front of the taco lines. Of course we were there when it was busy so everyone was trying to form around it. It was a mess and nobody knew where each line was going. My second complaint would have to be the tea. After selecting the unsweetened ice tea and running upstairs to eat we discovered that it was raspberry instead. Someone made an oopsie. 

After we stood in multiple lines to get an array of tasty tacos we headed upstairs to chow down. And boy was it delicious! The Al pastor was flavorful and we also tried vampiro which we had to ask a friend exactly what that was. But in the end I think the vampiro won me over and is now my favorite. We also had elote which my son devoured before I could get two bites. Ha ha.

All in all I enjoyed it and I would definitely choose this one over the other location."}
{"text":"Very unique experience.  Not sure if it's authentic Mexican but sure feels like it.  The Al Pastor tacos are great!

You just go up to anywhere and order, no real line or semblance or a line.  The tacos are a little over $2 a piece and are small, so the price adds up quickly if you get 4 or more.

This used to be an Irish Pub, then a night club and now a Mexican joint.  The cool thing is that it kind of feels like all 3 elements are combined.  You eat Mexican soft tacos while sitting in a night club with Gaelic style woodworking."}
{"text":"Since the hyped diminished Tacos El Gordo's quality and service, we decided to give Taco y Taco a try. 

We are hooked! 

First there are so many options that tacos el gordo's doesn't have. They have bowls, burritos, and real quesadillas. We got tacos which were very good. The meat portion was great and the taste of the meat was also great as well. 

The salsa bar was great. They had many salsas to choose from and you could get as much as you want. They also offer you black or pinto beans that you could get yourself. My favorite is that they have grilled onions right there for you to just grab. 

This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Good simple street-style tacos.  Better atmosphere than Taco Tijuana and has alcohol too!  Good place for happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Yum! So many options and at reasonable prices you can try more than one type of taco. The burritos are huge so maybe one will be enough... if not, I won't judge :)

super clean, super friendly can't beat it :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever (manager at a retail store btw, so you would think that giving good service would be a priority to all their guests like in all stores but guess not). Don't ever throw an event here, they will not keep up with you, inconsistencies from the beginning , broken promises, catering \"managers\" will not keep in charge of nothing; making you worry about simple things that a person throwing a party at a VENUE should not be worrying about. One of the cashiers that are supposedly supposed to be helping get annoyed with little requests that you wouldn't think you would have to ask for from them, but give you attitude because they say they \"don't have them.\" Which doesn't make sense because they end up bringing them 2 minutes later with a huge attitude. Don't recommend to anyone. Catering here will be a horrible experience! They will push your party back without a care in the world & without even letting the person know!!!! Trust me this place is not organized whatsoever& will ruin your night like it did with ours ."}
{"text":"The food here has always been fresh and hot. The kitchen is open, so you can see everything being made right in front of you. 

There is a nice salsa bar. Radishes, roasted peppers, pinto and black beans as well. The food has always been great, my favorite being the tacos pastor with fresh bits of pineapple. 

Even there there are separate lines for different tacos and burritos, we have always been lucky enough to simply place or order without needing the lines. 

Today our cashier was there waiting for us, and we paid quickly. This is not always the case. In the past we have stood there waiting for someone to ring us up before our food gets cold. I was rather surprised today to realize that 3 tacos (2 pastor 1 carne Asada) was $6.75, while a fountain drink was $2.75! Wow. But the food here is really good. Great deal on the tacos, not so much on the soda."}
{"text":"Still willing to drive to tacos el gordo after eating here. Super slow service. And the guy making our tacos kept dropping meat and couldn't stablized a damn taco. Then the cashier was having a beer. And the two guys mopping were counting their tips out on the floor. When they were done they didn't wash their hands, put gloves on, and went back to plating food. If that's the case then I'll go to the ghetto and gett better food for faster service. At least I  know what im getting myself into. The food itself was not bad, I like that they actually season (salt and pepper) food well. As an overall experience it was not very good."}
{"text":"Food is good. 
Ordering system is completely dysfunctional. There is no clear way to order, which I believe is by design. For example; I ordered some Carne Asada Tacos and asked for cheese, which I was charged for, my wife simply waited to ask for cheese from the toppings bar and it was free.
I understand \"upselling\" and have no problem with it, JUST DISCLOSE IT, AND MAKE IT CLEAR.  They run a \"smoke and mirror operation\" and end up nickel and diming you, totally unnecessary, most customers will pay for it, just be upfront. Did you think I wouldn't notice that my Tacos went from $2.50 each to $6.00??..please..!
I mentioned it to the cashier, and to their credit they said oh sorry...and my tacos went back to $3. I said \"hey I'm not asking for anything free, I just don't understand your system\". Unfortunately neither did the cashier, because after she explained it I was more confused than ever. 
DJ up front bumpin music, making all the seating near him virtually unusable.
Business is in complete identity crisis...Is it a bar, fast food, taco place, night club..or just over priced street tacos???

But...the tacos were good..however, I never met a street taco that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Fantastic establishment! Extremely tasty tacos, freshly served street-style in front of you.

Clean restaurant with plenty of seating. During busy times always staff on the floor cleaning up and ensuring the garbage doesn't pile up, and the tables are clear and ready to go.

Best Horchata in town, can't wait to go back at earliest convenience."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best deal on Mexican food in Las Vegas. Maybe even the best-tasting, too. The freshness of the ingredients is ridiculous. The salsa bar is HUGE and always well-stocked. They are extremely generous with the meats and fish. I ordered a delicious shrimp burrito for $6.50 with an enormous helping of fresh shrimp, and a big box of warm chips for $1.

There is no better place for quick and tasty Mexican in this town."}
{"text":"Move over El Gordo's. 

Taco's are $2 each, with burritos under $6. Nothing is overpriced here! I went here at first because of their Jelli radio ad, but from that time, I was hooked. I often bring friends from out-of-town here and they rave that they cannot find anything like that back home. 

One meat beats all other: Al Pastor. I can order four of those bad boys and still eat more. Their asada meat is also okay, but rather dry. I can spend $8 here and be so full I would not eat lunch the next day. If you're in a group (because this is the only way to avoid single person gluttony), get the fries with al pastor meat. Comes with cheese, lots of guac, and other fixings. I would recommend only ordering the half size because that was enough to feed four people and then some.

Everyone is really nice -- even when they heard my order wrong, they still fixed it and delivered it to our table. The salsa bar is immaculate, with six different types of sauces. The space is always very clean and they play a variety of songs. I enjoy watching Telemundo variety shows, though. 

Their customer service is also amazing -- we came in one day after EDC and they were running a special. Proof of attendance = 1 chorizo taco. 

PRO TIP: Check in via FB/Yelp and receive a corn on the cob -- they've seasoned it with hot pepper and buttahhh. I never knew until the cashier mentioned it."}
{"text":"The pinto beans and grilled onions on the salsa bar are excellent! I had the sofritas bowl.  Very good.   Not as good as Chipotle sofritas, but still very good!"}
{"text":"3rd or 4th time coming here are the food never disappoints  We always sit at the bar (they will take your order there instead of getting in line) have a tasty margarita carefully crafted by Yemily?  Love the smaller street tacos  means I can taste more right? Everything looks good   Give it a try"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! They have so many options. And the employees are very helpful and friendly! I got a burrito bowl and tasty street corn but next time would opt for the tacos. They have all those crazy (to me) meats like brains, stomach, tongue, etc etc! I wish they had adobada tho :( but a very nice salsa bar. I really love the decor and ambiance, they have upstairs seating as well. And a full bar!! Mas tacos y tacos por favor!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco has my favorite al pastor tacos in town. The meat is always flavorful and and tender, and it's topped off with sweet, juicy pineapple, crisp onions, fresh cilantro, and a light and creamy avocado sauce. I also like their Carne asada. I've only ever ordered their tacos, but their menu is vast, so one of these days I may be tempted to try one of their burritos, salads, or elote. I recommend a liter of Coca Cola or a bottle of cerveza with your tacos - they have a huge selection, including my favorites Bohemia and Negra Modelo. 

The customer service is always quick and friendly, their prices are comparable, the tables and dining area is larger than many taquerias in town, and their salsa bar is so stocked, it even has beans on it! Twice we've been there for lunch when La Buena 101.9 FM was doing a live remote, and one time my husband won a pair of tickets to Ricardo Arjona at Planet Hollywood. (Swoon!) Those floor tix would've cost us over $250 - we were flabbergasted! Best lunch date (and free fancy date night) ever!"}
{"text":"We are really happy we found this place. The ordering process was a little confusing but the people were nice and let us try a few things. I got the al pastor mulas and it was amazing. My husband got a burrito with Carne Asada and he said the beef was just amazing. There is a little salsa bar which is fun. We got the corn Mexican street style which is  on on the cob with mayo   cheese and Mexican spices. Fun to try but not amazing.  All in all we really like this place and will go back."}
{"text":"I went in Tuesday for the first time to try some tacos.  I ordered 4 chicken to go. The line situation is kind of confusing. They don't have someone at each station.  

The tacos did taste good so that's why they get a four star.  I like the salsa bar and taco toppings.  I think next time I will have to eat there.  When I paid I thought it was pricey.  I did not not notice until I left I was charged for six tacos.  I called and returned for a refund for the extra charge. 

I do not eat pork so I thought it was so disgusting seeing the cooked pig intestines at the next station. 

I will definitely try them again and hopefully it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating tacos in Vegas. What a great experience! The tacos are small but very delicious. The place is excellent value. You can even grab a nice cold beer while you eat. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"At first I was confused by the ordering stations but the employees were helpful.  Love it how you can customize by choosing the meat you want on your desired menu item.  We got Carnitas Nachos and they don't go cheap on the meat or toppings.  Also got a Carne Asada Burrito.  Both meats were flavorful and juicy.  Chips are freshly fried.  Nice salsa bar with lots of choices.  Restaurant is very clean.  Will definitely return when we are in Vegas next time!  Please bring Tacos y Tacos to Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't all that great the food didn't have any good flavor to it, wouldn't go back. I'll stick with taco El Gordo that's where u get fantastic tacos."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good. Wait time was a bit long when I ordered. I would call in advance if you're not planning to eat there."}
{"text":"Very disappointingly 'eh' experience.

The tacos are excellent, let's get that out of the way. The guys pitching you the tacos are friendly and do a great job.

The front-end staff though pretty much kills it for me. They took forever to get us rung up and even so they rung us up incorrectly (there were four of us it's not like there were 20)... As such, the line was long and when I didn't get something I paid for and tried to go up front to get it they wanted to take a freaking inventory of my meal to ensure I wasn't scamming them for chips.  

Additionally the pricing just wasn't there for me for a walk-up place like this. I was hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Had the chicken, shrimp and asada tacos, all were great! Also had a couple of Micheladas/Preparadas and they were delicious, just like homemade. I don't care much for the ordering system, but I definitely reccomend this place."}
{"text":"If you're familiar with the format of Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Taco Taco.

Walking in, you start off with a choice of food (tacos, burritos, bowls, etc.), along with the individual ingredients like meat, beans, and salsa that go into your order. The great thing about this place is their extensive selection of meats, ranging from the familiar carne asada,  to even some vegetarian options like soyrizo.

For my first visit, I went with an al pastor bowl. Everything was fresh and tasty. Their approach to food is a lot less greasy than the typical taquerias around town, which made it so I didn't waddle out of the restaurant with deep sighs of caloric regret. This is something I really appreciate, especially when I keep an eye out for a regular lunch spot. 

All in all, staff was very welcoming, prices are reasonable and food was definitely on point. Mark Taco Taco for another great new addition to east Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I love taco y taco! We've brought family and friends here and they love it too! Better than Tacos El Gordo! Tacos taste awesome! Great Mexican tasting tacos! Hand made tortillas for the carne asada tacos! The carne asada is actually asada (grilled beef) like it's supposed to be and not cooked in oil, so has that great carne asada taste. My husband likes the al pastor [or adobada] (pork) here cuz it's cooked on a vertical spit just like in Mexico, he says it gives it a certain taste. Here they top it off with pineapple pieces when they serve you al pastor, if you don't want them, just let them know. They have other meats here too, I like the cabeza. They have corn on the cob! They also make fries topped with any meat, you can choose what you want or don't want on them. They make burritos or bowls if you want more of an American chipotle style meal too, you choose what goes on it as well. They do make quesadillas and mulitas too. They also have Jamaica and Horchata drinks, which aren't the home made ones but they're actually not too sweet. There's 4 different lines: one alongside the left  is for the burritos, nachos, bowls, quesadillas, and corn on the cob. The next one says station #1 is the carne asada and chicken line, the following station #2 is cabeza, carnitas, buche, etc, and the last one, station #3 is al pastor... for each line there's a list of what they serve on top so common sense to which line you go to to get what you want (i.e. you can not get a carne asada taco in the al pastor line)"}
{"text":"Sweet heavenly tacos! A little confusing when trying to order but the staff is very helpful if you need the help. All the ingredients are fresh and there are loads of variations of tacos. I highly recommend the nachos...you'll never be the same again! They are out-of-this-world delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing... best and only al pastor I'll ever eat. Only thing that sucked is there are different lines for different items and you don't know until you order from the wrong line. But other than that.. wow.. my mouth and stomach were sooooo pleased!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting. Food is great but today we encountered a very rude and pushy lady behind the bowl counter. We felt rushed to order and choose our food and she snapped when asked about toppings. Don't know if we'll come back."}
{"text":"Great environment, much more friendly and cleanly than similar establishments. Ordering might be intimidating the first time around, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. Good spot to grab a quick lunch or sit and relax after work with a margarita."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Mexican places to choose from in vegas, but of all I've tried Taco Taco is the best. You hear their ads on the radio all the time and even though the ads are annoying, the food is great. The prices are very reasonable and there are a whole lot of options. The Asada tacos cannot be beaten by any spot in vegas."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! This is exactly the type of taco shop I have been searching for. Moving from San Diego where there is an abundance of delicious Authentic Mexican food, to Vegas where the authenticity seems sparse, I was thrilled to find a nice place to call my new go to Mexican food restaurant. 

My first experience here couldn't have been  any better. The staff was friendly and attentive and offered us various samples of their succulent meats. The Cochinita Pibil tacos...mah-gawd!! Absolutely superb...you must try it!! The meat was seasoned to perfection and left me salivating for more. Another must try is there elote; a traditional Mexican corn on the cob slathered in butter, parmesan cheese and chili. I seriously could eat this every day. 

The ambience is nice and clean, very modern and cozy. They have a full bar and large selection of beers (I went with my traditional Corona). The menu also extends to include various salads, burritos, and sides. 

I definitely can't wait until my next Taco y Taco experience and the million more visits I plan to make!! Ayayayay!!

Pro Tip: Ordering may be confusing for a newbie. You basically stand in which ever line or area you want to order food at and then get rung up at the register."}
{"text":"I'm a lil bias cuz I like wine and music with my Mexican food XD. This place is great the food is pretty delicious and if you want Mexican food but wanna break away from chipotle, this is a great choice to eat out.  Like a cross from an authentic taco shop up in north or central Vegas, except they have DJs happy hours and events"}
{"text":"Amazing little place for lunch or day drinking. Tons of taco options, always fresh. They also have several Mexican beers on tap and make some fun cocktails. Come hungry. You'll want to sample everything from the Carne Asada to the Suadero to amazing Pibil. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I grew up in LA where hole in the wall taco shops were everywhere. Eating here reminds me of when I got out of school and all of us broke kids would pull our money together and buy as many tacos as we could afford. And although I've come a long way from that, I do still know where I came from. 

The menu is super simple. It's divided up into stations depending on what you want to order. You just tell them what you want and they make it right in front of you. Hot and fresh!!!! Like I said, get pineapples with the al pastor tacos. Mind f***ing blowing!! Meat is tender and melt in your mouth. And when you add the pineapple, salt and sweet together, boom!!!! You just can't eat at Roberto's anymore. The most I could eat right now is 4, but I'm sure when my appetite is back to where it was, I can scarf down 10 with no problems. 

Their condiment station is ridiculous. All the extras (cucumbers, radishes, carrots, etc) are always fresh and don't look like they've been sitting out for hours. There are multiple sauces to meet everyone's taste preferences! So good I came back the next day for seconds just to double check if it was really that good. And it was :)

Now here's my reason for the 4 stars and not 5. I ordered the Mexican corn (elote) and it was just eh. I'm used to the the guy honking the horn with his cart, walking the neighborhood streets in LA. That's my comparison and it didn't meet it. Even after the mayo, Parmesan cheese and chili powder, it was still bland. Guess I need to take a trip back to Inglewood just for the elote guy. Second, the line to pay can be a pain. You're standing there waiting and your food is getting cold. Boo!!! And the horchata is way to sweet. Had to add water to drink it. 

But that's enough of the negatives. That's not enough to make me stop coming here. Now I don't have to drive to the other side of town for good eats. Now get your butt up and get some! Did you not see my pictures?!?! GO!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, I can't give them 5 stars anymore. This is just another fancy shmancy Americanized taco place. My parents love this place for some reason. Yet again they do not like to venture out of their comfort zones, so it's not like they know any better. We come here quite often and here are my reasons for dropping stars. 

1. The last 3 times, we've arrived during lunch time and the beans in the salsa area have not been ready. I understand beans take a long time to cook, but maybe come in earlier to get them started? Or maybe get an Instant Pot for the opening batch?Just a suggestion, you know I'm nothing but a paying customer after all. 
2. They've given us burnt meat in our al pastor tacos, like it's been sitting out for hours. How is this possible when we arrive an hour after opening? 
3. The portions have gotten a lot smaller. 
4. Presentation of the food is so sloppy now. Our last visit, my dad brought the food back to the table and my response was \"wtf is that?!\" 
5. They really need to have someone come out once in a while to clean the tables. One time, I offered wet wipes from my diaper bag to a couple so they could wipe down the dirty table next to us. 
6. The employees just aren't friendly. I get it that they get overwhelmed and busy, but you could at least try and smile. I asked the lady if I could have a side of beans from their burrito making station so my son could eat something, and she rolled her eyes. She did end up giving me the beans, but only after I stated that the beans at the salsa station were not ready and so my son could have something to munch on. 

I used to love their food a few years ago. Now the only reason I still set foot in here is because my parents love this place and I get a free meal. I would never spend my own money here since there are better taco places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love to try different places to eat and was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a run of the mill taco place. They had many options for meat as well as many vegetarian options which is good because I'm married to a vegetarian. The meat was flavorful and the prices were very reasonable. It came off very Chipotle like at first but this ain't no Chipotle. It's much much more! There is also a bar inside as well as a salsa table set up. They were very friendly and efficient. We did not know what to do or how to order at first and the guy at one of the stations walked us though it. We will return!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were my favorite, but I don't think you could go wrong here! Amazing tortillas and very fast service!"}
{"text":"This spot is great if your looking for an authentic Mexican spot without having to compromise a little bit of the chillax time. This place has some really good Tacos. I had the Al Pastor, Buche and Tripas. Great price without compromising the authenticity and flavor of tacos being made in Motherland Mexico. Great music the environment is great. Highly recommend this place. The taqueros we're on point when putting in your order.oh yes before I forget, I broke my diet today. SIGH!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!!! I keep saying I'm going to try their burritos but I keep ordering the same tacos. Very fast. Great service and a really good DJ that's not too loud and plays good music. My new weekend thing to do"}
{"text":"Should seriously reinvent the ordering process. Absolutely horrible & inefficient. Foods delicious but this process could keep me from returning. What if you ordered your drinks first & they were being made while you were standing in line waiting for your tacos? Maybe that could work?"}
{"text":"First time here and i will go back. The ordering system is weird but i can get used to it. You order the food first then pay. I like that you can sample the meats and watch them make the food. I got carnitas tacos and carne asada. Its a little pricey for me, 2.25 for a small taco about 13 bucks for 5 which is what i got. They both were tasty. But greasy as hell lol. I ordered to go but the inside looks pretty decent and chill."}
{"text":"I walk into taco y taco and immediately like the concept of an upscale taco restaurant with full service alcohol bar, salsa bar, and live mariachi, however I feel their tacos are not that great. The restaurant feels full of promise with experience but falls short on the food in my opinion. The tacos are not as flavorful as I had anticipated. They use a similar concept to tacos el Gordo where there are different lines for different styles of tacos. The only problem I have at locations with this concept is your first set of tacos are cold by the time you are done getting other tacos- or for that matter anything else. Same idea if you order burritos or other hot items you order it at counter and stand around for quite a while waiting for your food to be ready. The only item I order there is carne Asada fries."}
{"text":"We were a little confused by the separate lines. Lol. Finally figured it out. The food was really awesome. The michelada was yummy. Imagine a gourmet taco truck with seating. Street fare with flare. Don't go expecting some 4 star sit down experience. Don't be a snob. Love the mulas and tacos, on fresh tortillas. As for the PMS case on here, who downgraded the place because of the music, get bent. It's Mexican food, and therefore, Mexican music. I'm so sorry you had to get back into your SUV to hear Journey or Justin Beiber. If there is a band or DJ, expect it to be loud."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed T Y T before and looked forward to a great lunch.  And everything seemed like it would be good as usual....except everything came out cold.  cold tortillas, luke warm meat and room temperature corn.  Food came from 3 different stations and all failed.

When we arrived no one was ready for our order and the food looked old.

The only good thing was the foods (at least on initial bites), had good flavored...

We should have returned the food or walked out..,,"}
{"text":"It sucks having to drive all the way to charleston and etc... for mexican street tacos but I usually suck it up and just do it. Taco y taco gives me that option to avoid driving down to the east side but taste and price is at a compromise. 

There is a paper disclaimer in the small walkway to the restaurant warning people that this place is open to foodies with an open mind and some of the options they have will make people turn around. Honestly though... those options are worth the risk. 

Interior: BIG, so big that there is a second floor to eat tacos. Some days they have a dj spinning edm sort of music otherwise it's popular mexican songs. Clean for the most part and they have someone rounding all the tables to wipe up.

Food: Your standard taco joint options with the addition of burritos, and street corn. I always go for the al pastor (spicy pork on a pineapple spit) or the lengua (tongue) always tender with no foul odor. The street corn is just like the ones you'd get from the carts, cheesy with mayo and a slight kick from the tajin. Their burritos are a hit or miss, miss in the sense that the white rice will be mushy and ruin the burrito. Otherwise it's on point and make sure you ask for the cotijas (mexican parmesan cheese) it goes great.

Price: a bit higher than your regular mexican restaurant but not by much.

Overall: a nice option to get authentic mexican tacos in henderson but places like tacos el gordo is still better"}
{"text":"The reviewers giving this place 2-3 stars are morons. Why are you complaining about the noise levels WHEN IT SAYS ON THE DOOR THERE IS LIVE MUSIC certain nights?! WTF? As for the rest of the time, they aren't 'blasting club music' all the time at all, they will play a wide variety of music and on soccer/NFL days they will switch to the audio feed so you can enjoy the game. In addition, if you can't figure out how to order, or if you don't know what something is, ASK! The staff is very nice and accommodating, even thought the lines leave a little to be desired, admittedly. Must try the al pastor tacos, don't be afraid to try the cabeza, lengua, or tripas also. Corn on the cob street-style is delicious as well. 
If you're expecting Taco-Bell and are going to order a quesadilla and a chicken taco, save a few bucks and a yelp review complaining about something you don't know and just get your Taco Bell. If you're into trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone, this is a place for you. 
With seats at the bar almost always available and the managers/owners(?) always around, this is a new favorite place to frequent. Happy Hour is nice, but you don't need to break the bank to eat here even during regular hours. 
Must visit!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped to have dinner in our way home to SoCal. The tacos al pastor were delicious and so was the corn on the cob. A must stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Omg the pastor tacos are amazingggggg I can't wait to eat here again before I go home to la.  It's sooooo good you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was not impressed. I don't know if this place is too hyped up on good reviews or what but the food to me didn't hit the spot. I was disappointed with this place since I heard so many good things. The tacos were bland and the salsa bar was either way too spicy or salty."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Gran tacos are a must have. The salsa bar is almost like salad bar. They offer several different salsas, cucumbers, seasoned carrots, radishes, limes, peppers, and even beans!  

Each time I am here, I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in town!  We stumbled upon this spot after a grueling yoga class.  It was just what we wanted-just the right amount of spice!  I had a chicken vampiro taco and a carne asada tostada with a side of pinto beans.  My friend tried the street corn!  Everything was excellent.  This is the only location in Las Vegas, which is about an hour from me.  It's worth every minute of the drive.  I wish they'd consider opening one on the NW side of town!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who ALWAYS goes with what is safe, which is chicken, I am definitely starting to try different things I normally would say NO! But oh my, this al pastor has stolen my heart.. love at first bite! This place is LIFE & I'm so upset I did not try it sooner considering I know one of the owners. Please TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK! These tacos are addicting. I went here 3 days in a row last week after trying the al pastor smh I have a problem. & the guacamole!! I do NOT like avacados... wow this place has me in LOVE with all the things I never cared for too much."}
{"text":"Over all this Taco spot is great. 

 I really think they need to figure a better way to order your food or they need to make lines or maybe someone to guide their customers. First time going there and it was a bit confusing."}
{"text":"I enjoy the tacos here. My favorite would be the pork tacos. I tried several different meats for my tacos. I tried the beef, tripe, and pork. I also love their corn here. I get it with the stuff in it. They have a condiment station where there are limes, sauces, and toppings to go with tacos. Their mild sauce is pretty spicy so be careful if you can't eat spicy. It's a kick! They need to remodel their sitting area with the booth because there was a bunch of duct tape and stuff in it so we sat near the booth. If I'm craving tacos I would go here."}
{"text":"Great tacos, dope atmosphere. The pricing of the menu is respectable. Came with friends and had to come back the next day."}
{"text":"Love this place! The make to order right in front of you.
They have all the meats, a great Mexican place should...asada, pastor, carnitas, pollo, cabeza, lengua, cesos ....ect.

At about $2 a taco, it's a great fast meal.

They also do burritos, bowls, nachos and more..."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me, four and half stars. First thing we noticed, there was no A/C in this place by the way it was 110 outside. Then we ordered one burrito and two tacos. Al pastor and Carne asada meats were real bad but buche was OK. 

I am not sure who writes the other reviews but for sure I will never come back to this place even for free."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time earlier today. Tacos were awesome but the system can be confusing if you aren't familiar. Basically there are \"stations\" with the available taco meat options listed in each station. It was a good thing I went at a time that it wasn't busy so I was just able to switch over. I only got my tacos to go, but I definitely want I to come back with friends and try out their happy hour."}
{"text":"Located where The Republic Kitchen used to be. This place is a little slice of heaven, and this review is not for the faint of heart. I went on full Andrew Zimmern, I had the brains, intestines and tongue, thats right I said brains, intestines and tongue! This was the first time I have ever had brains, not quite what I expected but very good. Tongue I have had many times and I am a big fan! I have never had intestines before,these were so good that I am not sure but I think I dropped an audible F bomb. I say stop by and try some of the more exotic items on the menu. Save the chicken for you second visit! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, filling. These three words describe Taco Taco perfectly. You order at the front, then move along to the different stations based on what you order. You can get your tacos customized to your tastes and watch them make it in front of you. Props for the open kitchen! I had the cabeza, carne asada and al pastor. My friend got the buche and carne asada \"gran taco\" style, which means it comes stuffed with cheese, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and salsa in addition to the meat. I liked the cabeza the best, soft and with the right amount of spice.

There was only one cashier at the time I went, and she was busy cleaning tables for ~10 minutes, so my tacos were getting cold unfortunately. But they still tasted good! I really liked the condiment bar once you get into the dining area. So many salsas! And they had beans!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian tacos. That is all. 


Just kidding. But seriously, if you're a veggie lover and have a craving for tacos, this is your place!! They offer so many options of meatless Mexican eats that I try to bring people with me each time so that we can try them all. Whatever your flavor - soy chorizo, mushrooms, cacti, vegetables, or just cheese - Taco y Taco has got you covered. Eat it on tortillas grilled with cheese, on fries or chips, or as a bowl. For veggie options, order at the back of the restaurant. 

Don't forget the green sauce at the salsa bar!!"}
{"text":"As a first time customer it was a little overwhelming as they have a few different lines where you order different types of meat for your tacos. However, the staff was great and they clued us in on how everything worked and we began to get in the lines for what we wanted. Food looked and smelled awesome. We paid ($36) for a family of four and took our seats. Excellent food. Not a single person in our party had anything negative to say about the food. The handmade tortillas were amazing! Had to go back for a few more tacos after I finished my first three. Great atmosphere (a little loud but if you sit closer to the door it seems to be quieter), very clean, and fun place to have a casual dinner. Also, because today was Mother's Day, all moms received a free drink (Mimosa, glass of wine, Horchata, or soda). I'll be back for sure as there is many more items I want to try!"}
{"text":"I want to let everybody know that there are 4 lines!!! There are four different menus which means there are four different lines.

I usually only get the alpastor tacos. The alpastor line is the last on to the left. The preparer cuts the pastor meat right in front of you. The toppings they put on it are pineapple, onions,  cilantro, and this advocado sauce. 

The taco itself is VERY moist. The meat is not dry at all and it combines perfectly with the toppings. The advocado sauce is SPICY. So if you don't like spice I recommend getting your sauce at the sauce/salsa bar.

This place is very clean and they have a full bar. There are two levels of indoor seating and patio seating is also available. 

Pricing is not bad. It's $2.25 per taco and I heard they also have specials on taco Tuesday. 

If you're in the area and want tacos. This is the place to try."}
{"text":"First off the inside is very nice and it has a great atmosphere. Service was good. I had a carnitas burrito and enjoyed it, I also tried the pastro taco which I've never been a fan of so I won't judge it (I guess), but I will judge the carne asada fries which I felt were okay just a little dry."}
{"text":"Decent food, but a horrible ordering system that outweighs the decent food.

We ordered a variety of menu items. My husband had a Chorizo Breakfast Burrito and that was his favorite item we tried. The burrito was large and would be plenty of food on its own. I ordered a Chicken Taco, a Carnitas Taco, Mexican Corn, and a Chorizo Mula. We also shared Chips & Guacamole. The chicken taco was decent, the carnitas didn't have enough flavor, and I loved the chorizo mula. The meats overall weren't as well flavored as other tacos I've had. The Mexican corn was not as good as I expected and didn't have a ton of flavor. The chips and guacamole were great. I liked all of the salsas I tried from the salsa bar.

My pet peeve is when a restaurant can make good food, but can't run a business. Taco Y Taco is the epitome of this. Listen to your customers and do something to improve your ordering system. I've heard people comment that other taco spots in town have the same ordering system. Guess what? Just because something has always been done a certain way isn't a legitimate reason to continue doing it poorly. 

Here's how the ordering could be improved. Offer paper order sheets where customers mark what and how many items they want. Customers then hand the order form at the start of the cafeteria line and meet their order at the register at the end. Let the staff sort the separate meat areas in the back, stop making it the customer's problem.

The inside of the restaurant was a mess. I didn't see the staff clean a single table the entire time we were dining. It was fend for yourself at the least dirty table you could find. Silverware, condiments, and napkins are located on top of the trash cans next to dirty trays and whatever else people leave on top of the trash can. This needs to be moved to its own sanitary location.

It took us four years to give this spot a second try and it'll probably be at least that long before we visit again."}
{"text":"Love love the food so good just that when ordering the food was really confusing wasn't very organized.."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best authentic Mexican food I have had in a long time!!  The staff was very welcoming as well. Don't be worried ask questions they will explain the food is and it's very affordable!! Such an awesome place to check out if you wanna venture a little bit pay the strip!!"}
{"text":"If Chipotle and Taco's El Gordo had a baby, it would be Taco Taco.

The set up of the restaurant is a little confusing.  The doors facing the shopping center is actually the back door where you'll find the tables and salsa bar.  Instead, enter from the entrance nearest Pecos and it will bring you to the ordering stations.  

There are two ordering stations.  The one you see when you first enter is where you can order bowls, burritos, nachos, fries, and elotes.  The station with numbers on the side is where you order your tacos 

I love how friendly the staff here are.  They've always started a conversation with me while I'm ordering and helpd me change up my order. Did I mention the portions here are huge!!  So far everything I've tried, I couldn't finish.  

Al Pastor is my favorite choice of meat, but I find it to be too greasy and not as flavorful as my favorite taco shop.  The carne asada is really good though and I had a sample of their soyrizo and it was tasty! 

*free elote with check in!  If you've never had it, OMG TRY IT NOW! ITS HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH.  Corn topped with mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder.  If they dont offer it for free anymore... I'd still say you should try it.  $2 may seem like a steep price for corn, but I realized the cart lady at my park sells it for the SAME PRICE."}
{"text":"I came in to taco y taco with my girlfriend and some friends and I was quite disappointed. The environment is pretty cool. But I ordered the fries and the guy who made it was pretty rude. I was standing there wandering what's going on for 5 mins while others were getting served finally the fries came out and I didn't even get to choose ANYTHING. He just put some beef on it and pineapple and all these things I was thinking to myself don't I get to choose? At the end I asked for mild salsa and he said it was extra. I've never heard of a place charging extra for mild salsa. Anyhow it was a real disappointment I didn't like I what I got and the man who made the food was just rushing and real rude"}
{"text":"My cousin was raving to me about Taco y Taco and when I finally got to try it, it totally lived up to the hype! 

The place is huge. So much seating! Very clean & modern feel. 

You get in line for tacos based on what kind of meat you want. They have everything! Al pastor, carnitas, pollo, barbacoa, carne asada, and more (even tongue if that's your thing!). Street style tacos with everything - onions, cilantro, and salsa are where it's at! Although you can get burritos, tostadas, too. 

I went for carnitas, my favorite, and they did not disappoint! Juicy, crispy on the outside, and packed full of flavor. 

And let's have a moment of silence for the Mexican street style corn. ............. Get it, squeeze with fresh lime, stuff yo face, be happy. 

Salsa bar, thick crispy chips, cheap (2 tacos and corn for under $10!), and you can find me at Taco y Taco every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I visit Taco y Taco for lunch very often and sue to the large selection I change it up every time. If you love authentic Mexican street tacos, this is the place. I have a taste for what many qualify as the weird stuff on the menu but I encourage every one of you to be adventurous and try at least the tongue/lengua or tripe/trippas tacos. I highly recommend this Vegas gem! I am not a drinker but they do have an enormous full bar as well."}
{"text":"The food there was delicious and affordable. I didn't have to wait in a huge line either everything was made fresh and fast. You have got to try the corn on cob( Mexican street style) you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I am truly baffled that this place has any good reviews at all. My fiancée and I want here because I had a restaurant.com certificate. As soon as we walked in we saw a sign that said that these are not accepted, which I've come to recognize as a red flag that businesses resort to when they sign up for restaurant.com and then don't like not getting as much money as they want to for a transaction. So we should have walked out but stupidly didn't. Their ordering system is incredibly chaotic so it is almost impossible to order and have your order understood. It is also insanely expensive. One burrito (soggy and undercooked), a coke (their soda machine was broken), three street tacos and mole fries was $28. I have had much better food in greater quantity at Del Taco for $5. When the DJ (?) started setting up we couldn't get out fast enough. Please save yourself the hassle."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the ordering system and setup made no sense and was definitely not worth what I paid. The lady that made my food was a sweetheart, but the guy that took may money was kind of a jerk. I will not be back, too many other options in this town!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try! Not so bad for a saturday night. Let me start off  by saying they have happy hour from 5pm-7pm and then again at 11pm-2am (food and drinks) Today we tried the carne asada street tacos, pollo tacos, chicken nachos (huge portion) and mexican style corn.. YUMM! And also a margarita from their happy hour menu. Its a good place to hang with friends! Had a great time tonight, we definitely be back!! Thanks so much for the good customer service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We've heard about this legendary taco place on East Tropicana and was excited to see that one was being opened here in this location. Having been in the building when Republic was, we knew what to expect in terms of floor plan. When we walked in, everyone (I mean everyone) was uber friendly and much brighter than before. 

At first, it was confusing, they have stations, then one of the beautiful girls came over and gave us a tour and told us how it all worked. The cooks were offering samples so that definitely helped us decide what to have. We finally decided on the chorizo, carne, al pastor taco, and street style corn on the cob. I must say, if that is what they eat in Mexico, I'm moving to Mexico!! The chorizo was so damn delicious, I had to get up and get a second round. The salsa bar was an awesome touch along with the bar, they've got a decent selection of draft and bottled beer. 

Taco y Taco, although sit down style, is a an upgrade from their first location but certainly a wonderful addition to the Silverado Ranch area. The building is perfect, the food is pretty epic for the value, and is a definite hot spot for a late night 'I need a quick buzz kill'. 

Go check it out!! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, true Mexican flare and totally worth the trip down Tropicana! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good tacos. Guys, you need to try taco with mushrooms and cheese. Its something! Such a good stuff. 5"}
{"text":"We arrived and it was 3 minutes until closing and they treated us amazingly.   They did not close the door on us and they insisted we come in and order and waited for us until we were done.   Customer service is not dead at this place.   In addition, the food was amazingly good.   Tacos al carbon were delicious.  The corn was spicy but good.   I will be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food and it's fast and fresh!! I'm so glad they opened up Taco Taco in my neighborhood. Everything I've tried is super tasty. I love nachos and I think theirs are especially good and they aren't a soggy mess, the chips stay crunchy and the toppings are yummy! One of my favorite things about Taco Taco is the salsa bar! I believe they have 8 different kinds of salsas to add to any of their delicious items."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, decor is cute and staff is really nice. The most important thing is that the food is BOMB. I got a buche taco, al pastor taco, and Mexican corn on the cob. The al pastor taco was the best out of all of them, with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?). Buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad. The corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit. The mole fries are AMAZING. Ten out of ten will come back for them."}
{"text":"Make sure to order a Gran Taco! one of my favorites! such a BEAST taco! I dont hesitate to drive across town for some amazing food! Seriously one of the few taco restaurants where you can take a date! she will thank you later ;) if you know what i mean!! :D"}
{"text":"My second review.

Taco Taco has become a weekly tradition for me. I come after work on Fridays as a gift to myself for all my good behavior of not dining out and not buying food during my work week I end my Friday by hitting up Taco Taco. 

I have come to love their burritos and although I am a fan of tacos I have always been more of a fan of burritos. Upon first coming here I ordered tacos, because well, the name. But after returning a few times I branched out. Believe me, everything here is good, not just the tacos.

Many have compared this place to kind-of-sort-of Chipotle. I sort of agree. The burritos here are made in the same fashion - pick your meat, pick your other ingredients. I LOVE their pollo here. It has such an amazing flavor and the rice has a rich flavor as well. Beans are on spot and the tortillas are perfect - not too thin, not too thick. 

Needless to say I love this place. I just want to tell the (Yelp) world!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. The lines are quick, food is amazing and the salsa bar is to die for."}
{"text":"Great spot kinda close to the strip, al pastor is amazing and adding pineapple to tacos sounds crazy but I was proven wrong. Nachos were bomb. Totally recommend this spot to anyone who visits Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan of their Al Pastor taco.  I get it loaded up with everything except pina...don't like sweets on my taco...and I go at it!  Fresh meats and hand made tortilla are the game changer here.  Service is good too.  Lot of times the guys joke around and engage in a brief conversation when you are ordering, which is always nice.  They took over the old Republic Kitchen which took over the old Fado so the ambiance is really nice for a taco concept.   I think the Sansone group has a long term tenant with these guys."}
{"text":"First of all, the line arrangement may seem professional but it's not. Why complicate things? Just have 1 person check out orders instead of 1 person per certain meats? Secondly, customer service is inefficient and unprofessional. Coming in confused I asked how things worked and the dude with a tattoo on his left eyebrow told me and my girlfriend \"to make things easy on us, he won't make tacos for us\" if I didn't want tacos I wouldn't have yelped there. Lost appetite and won't come back. He even commented to \"not come back\" and he's not \"tripping \" started to laugh with his other ghetto looking bald Mexican looking coworker while he laughed along too. As a professional business man specializing in Medical Equipment and IT Services in hospital environments this is unprofessional. Will let all my friends and family in Vegas and Los Angeles county know not to bother. You get better service for street tacos instead."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! I really enjoyed this place. The staff was very pleasant and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I go here every time I go to Vegas, I recently introduced my friends here and they always want to come back. We always get the carne asada tacos & fries. The meat is so juicy and the flavors just go so great together. My boyfriend likes to her a burrito and best believe they load it up with a lot of everything! So so good, I love their horchata and street style corn too! Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  The staff is VERY stingy with the lids to there salsa.  I bought 25 dollars worth of take out and they would only let me have 3 salsa lids so each person getting food barely had any salsa.  I asked them to buy more and they would not.  It was really disappointing because the food was so good.  I won't be going back because I like salsa with my food.  If you don't like salsa then your fine. Not giving enough lids Really cheapens this place.  They have lots of customers you would assume they can afford to give you salsa.  I think over time they will really get hurt by this."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Try the pork tacos with everything  even the pineapple. Trust me. It's amazing!! :) get your booty down there!!! The 2 times I went there the place was popping and the music was way way up!! Wish there was coupons or special deals could have been a few dollars cheaper. But I am happy I went! Super yummy!!"}
{"text":"Subpar. I ordered a al pastor bowl - very bland. Place opens at 10:00am, by 11:00am, the black beans were not done - still hard so the only option was pinto beans....bleh. The salsa bar doesn't say what is what so it's a lot of waste trying to find out which ones are mild, medium, spicy or pure lava. At 11am they were out of the creamy cilantro lime dressing which I heard was the best. The guac is from a store bought container - not fresh. Overall, it wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. Just meh. Probably won't go back, but I did hear the tacos, nachos, and quesadillas are a kit better than the bowls so...."}
{"text":"Went in on Halloween day with my husband and got so extremely sick within an hour of leaving.  Had a burrito bowl with salsa and ended up with severe food poisoning.  Wanted to try this spot as I pass it all the time.  First red flag was an employee emptying container after container of store bought guacamole in a container to serve as their own.  Second red flag was the cleanliness of the salsa bar.  Bummer to miss Halloween but happy I'm alive.  Hopefully this was an isolated incident.  I definitely won't return....EVER!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great customer service! We will be back! Awesome authentic Mexican food! Very clean!"}
{"text":"This only gets three stars cause the food is amazing! Other then great tasting food, place is very confusing. When you walk in there is a line that no one has any idea what line they are in. The first two are for tacos, but if you want a burrito or fish tacos you have to go to another line.  They tell you to go there but then you pass 10 people and I feel like I'm cutting everyone in line.

Everyone stood and looked at each and was  like what line are we in? Once you get to that line your suppose to be in, they don't speak English.  I ordered a carne asade burrito, and they tried to give it to someone else. I told them that's mine and he said ohhhh, and had to open it, but looked at me weird cause he did not speak English!

I would give them a 1 star but the food is amazing! Great prices too! Just really confusing.  We also came on a Tuesday night and damn if there wasent 50 kids running around up and down making a ton of noise!"}
{"text":"Food and staff were great differently my new spot for tacos!"}
{"text":"We ordered from postmates the charge is supposed to be 3.99 when we checked out the fee matched our order that was 12.00 they added some fees with no breakdown. Total rip off when it is advertised at 3.99"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! The minute I walked in I knew I liked it. With four or five taco stations, people manning each station making your taco to order with fresh ingredients was fantastic fun and an eating delight. Don't hesitate to ask questions they are very accommodating with their explanation of how the meats  are prepared and their tastes.  I really liked watching how cheese is fried onto a tortilla. Everyone working there was top-notch accommodating and friendly; pushing my rating to a full five star."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty tacos. 

Plenty of upstairs/downstairs seating. Booths and tables laid out on the restaurant floor. 

You order and immediately receive your food before paying. 

Carnitas and lengua are to die for."}
{"text":"Los mejores tacos de Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I frequently go to the other location on Eastern, but I was in the neighborhood, so I decided to try this location. The food was just as delicious as my regular location (especially the al pastor). The location itself.....lets just say that the premise matched the neighborhood (as does the other location). It wasn't enough to make me sick them a star from my review of the other place, just don't come here expecting a swanky atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's like a less organized Chipotle, but with better food. Loved the al pastor! I got mine in a bowl, but next time I'll probably get it in tacos. Lots of options, but the ordering was a little googly."}
{"text":"i love the food here. the food is made to order. everything is so tasty!!!! my to go to place for mexican food! the burritos,tacos and fries and nachos with meat are all amazing! a must try spot! i recommend you try this place if your looking for authentic mexican food ,,, its sooo good! ;) chava always cooks the best and provides awesome customer service! he holds it down here."}
{"text":"Never seems to disappoint.  The bartenders are very warm, friendly and make amazing drinks.  You are not just a customer here, they want you to feel like family.  The food is good however, not everyone that works here speaks and understands English.  

I came with a group and one of the people in our group is allergic to raw tomatoes and we had a real hard time explaining this to them.  One guy had no idea what she was saying and called over another guy who somewhat understood but was still confused.  The girl making the tortillas had no idea what was being said but glad to say she got some AMAZING tacos with no tomatoes of any kind on them.

There is nothing on the menu I can say is bad here however some of the items were very salty.  One person in the group go a Chorizo taco and was way too salty for her.  She gave it to me and even I could tell it was very salty but that was the first time I tried the chorizo here so I do not have another experience to compare it to.

The Al Pastor is Amazing, the Pollo tacos, burritos amazing.  The Mexican Corn on the Cob, WOW that is some good stuff.  The Mole Fries, sweet potato fries with cheese, mole, chicken, is your mouth watering yet....get a margarita to wash it down and you will be in heaven.

The owners were here again on this visit which I mentioned in my last review...They were busy but I need to address something here. 

They are young, beautiful, successful women who have a place that makes amazing food and has a great atmosphere.  I did get a response to my last review where I mentioned the owners did not seem real friendly to the customers, they basically ignored everyone instead of saying hi and see how things were going.  The response was that they used to do this but some people took offense to this and thought they were flitting with people when they came to your table.

First off, they can flirt with me anytime...Second, this is their business and it shows a lot of Pride and Satisfaction in an owner who walks around, welcomes you and thanks you for coming into their business.  If anyone takes offense to this, then go eat somewhere else.  NEVER NEVER NEVER put an owner of an establishment down or say they are flirting with you or someone you are with when all they are doing is QUALITY CHECKING the Satisfaction of the Customer.  You SHOULD ONLY BE SO LUCKY IF THEY WERE TO FLIRT WITH YOU!!!

This place has great food as stated above and everyone should try this place."}
{"text":"I apologize to my fellow Yelper's but this place has unfortunately really gotten cheap. The nachos are a good size but the chips tasted like they were fried in old oil.  

The tostada is not even close to what a tostada should be.  They don't have refried beans, really?  What happened to the authenticity?

 The burrito is a good size but the chicken was dry and they guy forgot about it once he put in on the oven press.  He gave me the nachos and walked away.  I stood there & when he came back he looked at me and asked me what else I needed?  I looked at him, I pointed to the oven press and said my burrito?  Needless to say it came out burnt.  

The dining room had a lot of empty tables all dirty and the entire place just felt less then impressive.

I ordered a house margarita with salt, not only was it in a very small glass which I have never seen here before, there was no salt on the rim and to charge $9 for that is way more then it was worth.

This is not the first bad experience I have had here but I can say it will probably be my last as this is an experience we did not enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Could be wayyyyy better with a bigger bar and TVs above the cooking stations. PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tacos I've had in a while.  I had the suadero and carnitas.  Both were tender and delicious on freshly made corn tortillas.  You must try an elote, Mexican style corn on the cob.  It was perfect and flavorful, buttery, cheesy, limey, and spicy. They also have authentic and perfect Guacamole. The salsa bar is one of the best: salad and vegetable accompaniments, hot black and pinto beans, and a tasty array of salsas.  The service was perfect; these people are so kind and helpful and treated us like family. The place was immaculately clean.  Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby was craving a late night snack. This place is close to where we live and I'd heard good things. So I drove over and got a selection to bring home. 

I asked which meats were best to try and went with all of their suggestions. I thought I ordered about six tacos, but some how ended up with eight...I couldn't even tell you what they all were (I know Barbados, carnitas, chorizo and lengua were among them). I also got some loaded fries and stopped at the topping station for two spicy salsas and what I assume was some kind of creamy avocado sauce. 

Over all, everything was extremely bland. The loaded fries - there wasn't enough cheese, the cheese wasn't melted, flavorless guacamole, and the fries were some of the worst fries I've ever had  in my entire life. The chorizo was too spicy for my tastes and every other meat tasted the same  - they all blended together. Very disappointing. Even worse that it all gave me a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, and quick! What else could you ask for? Walk up to the taco counter, choose your meat, and what kind of carb you want it nestled in. Boom...donezos! Couldn't be easier! The Al Pastor (the adobada marinated meat on a swirling spit) is pretty popular and rightly so. Nothing but tasty goodness. I asked what the differences were in a few different pork preparations: pibil, buche, and carnitas and the guy gave us a sampling of each. All different cuts of meat marinated in various ways and each just as tasty as the one before it. Seriously, can't go wrong here. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I recently came here with some friends to catch up and grab some tacos. I was really surprised by how big this place was and the set up with nice and organized too. You order your food at three different stations and there's even a bar on the side.

Food wise I ended up getting one al pastor and one buche taco along with a street corn. I thought the tacos were very good and liked that there was a salsa bar to grab my own limes and avocado cream sauce. The corn was good too, but it had a little too much cheese for my liking. Oh yeah and I can't forget my michelada, probably my favorite part of the meal. It was just the right amount of spice and deliciousness and only $5 during happy hour.

I can't wait to come back here again to try some different tacos. The margaritas looked great too!"}
{"text":"Yeah the ordering is stupid. So what, you'll figure it out and then have a delicious meal. The al pastor is amazing. The meats are juicy and the staff was very friendly. Sure any moron could come up with a better ordering system. Again, so what? 

Mmmmmm, tacos."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a long time and finally made it today. They have street tacos of all kinds of meat, burritos, nachos, tostadas etc. We had tacos el pastor, asada fries, carnitas taco, and tostadas de buche. Loved the tacos el pastor! They had great flavor. Also liked that we could order beers or whatever. If u like authentic street tacos then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had in Vegas and I've been here a decade. Super fresh ingredients kept simple and delicious.  Fast and friendly service and very reasonably priced.  The Mexican Corn and Carne asada or carnitas vampiros were outrageous. The salsa bar?  It's a 10. 

I've seen some crazy complaints on here and I'm super confused. The ordering process is pretty straightforward if you have the ability to look up AND the ability to read. It's like a casino buffet in that you go to separate counters to order different items and then hit the cash register. 

And the atmosphere is fantastic. Super casual,  a lot of seating and yes there was a DJ playing music. So if you're looking for a place to bring your Nana who's hard of hearing or a place to propose to your beloved,  this would not be a good choice. Also if you're the dick who likes to talk on your phone so the rest of the restaurant is forced to listen to a one sided conversation,  blissfully this place is also not for you. 

Perfect place for friends and family to chow down on delicious, affordable grub in a fun atmosphere with great extended hours.  Love me some Taco y Taco!"}
{"text":"I felt very scatter brain when I was in here. 

I was obviously lost in the mix because I had someone come up to me and ask me if I needed assistance.  My hubs had been here before and said his co workers like to frequent this place.  I love me some mexican food so I was down to try it.  

Me, I totally thought it was a Chaotic environment.  You know how you order food back in high school, pick a line of the food you want to purchase?  Well that's exactly how they do it here.  My hubs said that's how they ordered back in Cabo, but I've never been.  HINT JESSE N.  This place is very hip and they have been featured in some of Las Vegas' foodie magazines.  So yes, you still should give it a whirl.  

I like variety, so if I have to stand in several different lines to get my variety, I know my food will be cold.  That is part of the reason why I gave my 3 star score.  I also still left hungry after eating 3 tacos and a corn.  hahaha, this small girl has a big appetite."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Al Pastor tacos, this is the place to go! Hands down the best in town. The other tacos aren't too shabby either, but if you don't get the adobada (al pastor) you are wasting your time here. And that is the reason that you see my four stars: the other tacos are just ok and the burritos are just mediocre. I have not tried their other offerings so my four stars are based on the tacos and burritos. But honestly, why would you go to a place called Taco y Taco if you aren't getting tacos..."}
{"text":"Very flavorful tacos and meats. Not much skiing the ones if she items. If you aren't familiar with where to live up for different meats, it's confusing and also annoying if you want to go in multiple lines and it's crowded."}
{"text":"Great place to tame a craving for authentic street tacos and so much more!! A variety of tacos to choose from: carne asada, al pastor, grilled chicken, carnitas, and even buche. If tacos is not what you're craving...fear not!! They offer burritos, nachos, quesadillas, vampiros, Mexican street style corn on the cob and even a full bar!! Speaking of bar, hit the salsa bar and make sure to try the black beans & grilled onions...very flavorful indeed!!! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Al Pastor tacos are the best!!  The pineapple adds so much - yes pineapple, are you curious?!!   We've been to both locations for lunch and dinner as well as had them cater to our office.  Both catering appointments they were on time.  You might catch a line now at then at the restaurant, but they move quickly and the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Open late, near my humble abode, on the way back from the airport...perfect!  I work closer to the original location but was thrilled to have Taco y Taco join the hood.  It was very fancy inside but had everything we could want after traveling from Islip to Baltimore to Raleigh to Vegas with snow, delays, wind, and no food.  Open late every night (til 11 Sundays), this was the perfect place for Eric R.'s taco craving and my desire to eat lengua!

There was a lady dressed in sequins helping me understand how to navigate the new layout, and she was very nice!  I asked her a few questions about menu items since I typically just get tacos.  I ended up getting one lengua taco and one vampiro - 2 tostadas with melted cheese stuffed with lengua, onion, cilantro, and salsa...sooooo goooood.  We also got a side of guac to share.  Eric R. got the barbacoa burrito, but he thinks he got carne asada instead.  The salsa bar was fully stocked and we munched our way into oblivion...okay I mean happiness.

Overall, for affordable late night eats, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole!
Eat your heart out, La Comida.  Your tiny $11 guac had nothing on my 3x the size guac with chips for $2.05 here!

Randal R. and I went as first timers today for lunch.  We walked in through the seating area and found our way to the other side to look at the menu.  I ordered a grilled shrimp taco and 2 lengua tacos to start.  Randal R. ordered 5 different ones (carne asada, al pastor, lengua, buche, and the May special chicharron with pickled onions).  He got Mexican Pepsi, I got Mexican coke.

We were given a freshly roasted plate of green onions and jalapeno, but were chased by a cook with a steaming plate of grilled onions which were amazing with a squeeze of lime.  The salsa bar was stocked with radishes, limes, cucumbers, steaming hot beans, and 8 salsas.  I started off by grabbing the 3 green salsas.  I love green anything (except celery) so this was great, a trifecta!

I had the shrimp first - stuffed with grilled shrimp, avocado, lettuce - sooo tasty.  Then, the lengua - it had tomatillo salsa on it along with cilantro and diced onion.  I added a squeeze of lime and some of the fresh bright green salsa too.  Perfection.  Juicy, tender, zingy...thank goodness I had 2!

Then we decided we needed to do a salsa tasting - I got an order of chips and guac on the cheap and then got all 8 salsas lined up.  My fave was definitely the bright deep green one.  The habanero salsa had a warning but was not very spicy to me.  I really liked my meal and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some sweet tacos, look no further.  I finally have found a taco joint here in the valley that makes authentic Tacos al Pastor.  They have a decent selection of taco styles but I chose to go with the Al Pastor and the Mexican Street Corn on the Cob.  Needless to say, the food was delicious, and I will definitely be back for another round of amazing.  The only confusing thing is walking in the door you kind of get lost as it is first come first serve seating and the lines have no real direction.  So as soon as you walk in, get to the counter ASAP!  Regardless, this is my new favorite taco spot!  Thanks Taco y Taco, can you start up a Burrito y Burrito?"}
{"text":"The food here is always really good and I always get the same thing. The reason for the two stars is I'm never charged consistently. Every time I order my soyrizo breakfast burrito the price is always different. Half the time it is the $5.25 and the other half they say it's a specialty burrito and then it's $8.25. (There was another instance where I ordered a carne asana breakfast burrito and I was told that because I wanted carne asada it would be 8.25). I always question why I always get charged different prices and I'm always told the person before did it wrong and what they are doing is the correct way. I still love the food and I wouldn't stop coming here based on this issue alone, but I wish everyone would be on the same page with what meats (or nonmeats) are considered \"specialty\" when it comes to certain burritos."}
{"text":"I love this place! Located in such a convenient little plaza. As soon as you walk in you see how spacious it is and all the wonderful smells drift to your nose! Their pastor tacos with pineapple are my hands down favorite and their elote is also delicious! They have a full bar so you can sip on a nice beer to go with your meal!"}
{"text":"$2.25 a taco is a bit expensive! Not the greatest tacos. I can only think of coming here if it were after the club hella hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the meat quality here is unparalleled in Vegas. Many places have their meats already chopped so it's drying out all day and they try to reconstitute it after you order. Not this place, the meat stays whole in their original (muscle or organ) size until you order, at which time it's chopped for your taco. This makes a huge difference in the freshness and juiciness. And extra credit for having 2 types of hot beans at the cold salsa bar for you to 'load up'!"}
{"text":"We visit here once a week at least. We love the atmosphere. It took a little to get used to the line system. But after the first time we're good to go.

I can't really say what is my favorite item cuz I like everything. But our go to foods is Al pastor nachos with everything including pineapple trust me its tasty. Al pastor tacos are excellent but my kids love the quesadillas. They put guac and sourcream inside, so its basically a big taco with cheese.

This place never disappoints, We try to go and catch a football game. Tacos, nachos, beer, football? What more can I ask for!"}
{"text":"This eatery is located on the outer area of the Las Vegas main strip.


This eatery is located within a shopping center which is fairly large so parking should not be a problem.


Our group came into the eatery about fifteen minutes before they were closing, but still staff stated they'd stay open later for our group of about twelve people. 


Their ordering process is cafeteria style where you stand in line based on the type of meat you want for your tacos. 


Once you know the meat you want, the staffer in that area of your meat or meats will cut up your meat and make your tacos. 


After your tacos are made, you go into another area to meet with the cashier to pay.


The eatery offers tacos of carne Asada, Adobada, el pastor, chicken, cabeza and much more. Tacos come with onions, tomato, cilantro and guacamole.


The presentation of the tacos looked great, the smell was good too according to another groupie. 


The eatery also offers a wide selection of salsa's to serve onto your tacos with limes and onions or tomatoes on the side salsa bar if desired. 


The meat was tender in each bite, flavorful al pastor, chicken and carne Asada. I highly recommend their tacos and a visit for tasty, tender meat and good customer service.
Their salsa selection is also flavorful especially the Orange one.


Tacos are priced at $2.25 each. Note that they also make mullitas, burritos and carne Asada fries or nachos for your pleasure."}
{"text":"I did the math for how much I spend here a month it's close to $250. Ridiculous on my behalf, that's how much I pay for my cell phone family plan. The service from the taco guys is superb. They're always busy but always so kind and helpful 5stars for them! The food is pretty good actually and the prices are a little high for tacos but I understand quality over quantity. So I don't mind, the price 4stars. BUT the check out service is AWFUL. My mistake is tipping for bad service. I don't like not tipping because I like beer money too. The cashiers and the lady that helps at the corn section get 1 star because 0 isn't an option. I have NEVER had such awful service. The front counter is my least favorite they're always rude and act as if they hate their jobs you can hear it, see it, AND feel it. I've been in food for 10years I know service can get hard and frustrating I get it we have bad days. I've kept going because for the most part it's a decent experience. After the last time though I will definitely start looking for a new spot. It's just to bad because I love the taco guys!"}
{"text":"I looooove this place, I come here all the time with the fam. But you can notice right away that the owners take care of the Henderson location first rather than the Tropicana location. The times I go to Henderson they have everything in stock....but when I go to Tropicana they always run out of avocado , you would think after running out so many times you would have a good idea of what you need in the store . Still love this place no matter what.... Just wish owners took care of their own ."}
{"text":"Really good food usually. I get the street Grilled chicken tacos and sometimes they're good and sometimes the chicken is really burnt but it's cheap. Workers are very rude, yell at customers and toss their food to them. really horrible customer service without a manger in site"}
{"text":"One of the bombest quesadillas I have ever had ! The carne asada was succulent and the guacamole was flavored to a tee ! On top of that the service was excellent the girl at the cash register was so sweet to me and my boyfriend ! Shout out to her :))) thanks girl for making my night !! I hope you guys see this ! The facility is clean and neat and there is plenty of parking ! Had such a fun time here !"}
{"text":"This place can be a little intimidating if you've never been. Four different lines and a ton of options. Try the Alpastor taco (amazing) and a vampiro (basically a crunchy quesadilla w/meat). If you get a little lost ask someone for help and they'll happily guide you through the menu and they let you sample any of the meats (if your feeling adventurous)."}
{"text":"Best Mexica Food in Las Vegas
When I was growing up my family has 3 taqueria in Mexico, this tacos are so good that really bring me back memories.
The place is clean, good customer service too.
If you really want to taste Real Mexican tacos, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: would be a cool concept if it was maintained. We went on taco Tuesday around 8:15pm and I thought it would have been busier but there were still plenty of tables.

Service: no service at all. You waits in lines, which don't make sense. Different lines for different items instead of just ordering. 

Food: was decent. Wouldn't say it's the best Mexican food in town.

Price: comparable to a chipotle or don tortaco.

Cleanliness: not very clean at all. Tables were dirty. Floor was dirty.

From the outside the place looks cool. Then you get inside and having to line up like a school lunch line was a bit strange for the type of atmosphere the decor on the inside has."}
{"text":"Just go. Just eat. It is awesome. Stop reading.... just go! Best tacos in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, delicious and authentic tacos!! This place has quite the verity of meats to choose from for your street taco, burrito or nachos. Need a quick snack or wanted a whole meal this place delivers!!"}
{"text":"I had a really good vegetarian burrito here, my only complaint was that when I ordered it and was asked what I wanted on it, I said everything--cheese, sour cream, salsa, guac--and apparently the plain mashed avocado is included in a veggie burrito but not guacamole--which is silly because the only difference is that the guacamole had tomatoes in it which is the same as my getting the free salsa. The girl did not tell me guacamole was extra, and thus when I got to the register my vegetarian burrito cost me $10 which is pretty ridiculous. Coming from pricey San Francisco where I can get a vegetarian burrito for $5, makes me not want to pay double in Henderson."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted how to write this review so I'll start with this-- I love Taco Y Taco!  The food is amazing, the prices are reasonable and I go there all the time!  I just want management/corporate to see this review because I'll NEVER GO AGAIN ON CINCO DE MAYO.  The way you order food here is **already confusing enough** with a separate line for each type of food.  And god-forbid you want more than one type of taco/meat you have to stand in each separate line and once you wait in every line, there's ANOTHER line to the cashier.  Add 300+ people crammed in the room, nobody had any idea what they were waiting in line for.  People were cutting and being rude.  There was about 25 mins from when we got our tacos and street corn to when we made it to pay.  By the time we sat down everything was COLD and not as good.  This is simply an infrastructure failure on the manager's part to not anticipate and control the flow of the crowd.  They could have made cones or ropes and directed the line in a way that could have gotten everybody fed and happy.  Instead it was CHAOS.  Honestly we would have walked out the door had it not been for the nice girl at the entrance handing out free Coronas, which calmed me down enough to wait.  Epic fail by management.  Great tacos!!  For some reason Yelp won't let me attach a picture but I have one of my girlfriend practically being TRAMPLED  and holding up her phone with a cartoon picture of \"HELL\"."}
{"text":"Think of this as a mediocre version of Tacos El Gordo, but in Henderson and less authentic. I had the al pastor fries, which were decent. The meat came from a metal tin like they would do at Chipotle. Al pastor meat only comes straight off the spit when ordering a taco. I didn't try any of the tacos, so I'll have those next time and maybe this place can earn a higher rating."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! It's a fancy little taco joint. The tacos were great, the asado fries not so great.  The meat was overlooked for sure.  I was almost wondering if they just threw the leftovers scraps from the taco stove onto the fries.  The corn was good. Doesn't beat the cart flavor! The horchata was as expected.  They had a Mexican dance performance since it was cinco de mayo weekend.  The first 3 min was cool.. After 10 min it became annoying cause it was so loud you could not enjoy your food.  I disliked having to fall inline at each stand depending on your meat choice.  Overall ok, ok place."}
{"text":"I was craving legit tacos al pastor from the Mexican Riviera and Taco y Taco definitely came through for us! The tacos al pastor were delicious. We also had the Mexican street corn, a novelty - but equally as good! The salsa bar had tons of variety including two tours of ridiculously yummy beans, at least half a dozen salsas, roasted peppers, pickled & fresh veggies. Top it all off with a fully stocked bar and I am sold. We will be coming back for all of our authentic Mexican food fixes. At their low prices, that will be often!"}
{"text":"Tacos are decent priced and the asade tacos are sooo good. I tried the pork also and it was okay. In addition, I bought a cup of beer with my tacos, and the beer was refreshing. Quick and efficient service. I will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's really nice. You go in and you order it's kinda like a line system. You know the ones back when you where in school lol. They serve you quickly, their friendly, it's just a good place!"}
{"text":"A fairly authentic Mexican street taco outfit, in the vein of Tacos el Gordo, but with a polished enough decor to appeal to most Henderson gringos. I doubt the average gringo will order cabeza, sesos or tripa but it's still cool that you can find these delicacies in this part of town. To stay on the safer side, I suggest the Al Pastor which I think is their best offering along with an elote (street corn). Try a mushroom quesadilla: simple yet delicious. Overall a great place for a good Mexican fix without having to set foot in an abomination like Chipotle or Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  Ordering is a lil weird but oh well.  Had shrimp tacos, it was pretty good but kinda skimpy on the shrimp. Pico was outstanding probably the highlight of meal.  This place is worth a once over.  Might go back......Eastern Ave got a crapload of places to eat so it may be awhile."}
{"text":"At first glance, the restaurant looks really fancy. There are different ordering \"stations\" for the type of tacos and taco meat that you order. Confusing and there are no signs that explain anything. The food was alright, could have had more flavor but they at least have a good variety of different kinds of meat. The eating areas don't seem to be cleaned often"}
{"text":"Taco Taco. From my last review almost 5 months ago to now the only thing that's changed is the price. I spend 40 cents more for lunch than I used to. But I'll gladly pay it for an Al Pastor burrito that is unlike anything else I've ever had. The chips are made fresh every day. And over the past few months and many visits I've only seen the salsa bar run low on salsa once....and they took care of it fast. The Mexican Coke is ice cold and service is fast and friendly. 

The 5 Stars I gave out months ago is still just as valid today as it was then. When I have family come in from out of state, this is where I bring them. Everyone in my family loves this place, so much so that social media checkins prompt a round of I wish I was there comments every time. 

5 Stars, and a bump to my Best of Las Vegas and Failsafe Food lists. Again all of it earned. They just celebrated their 1st Anniversary and with food this good, it certainly won't be their last celebration."}
{"text":"Once again we headed to this location for a lite lunch.  My wife and I each settled on a pair of al pastor street tacos while sharing a diet coke.  The meat was sliced to order and topped with crema, onions, cilantro and canned pineapple that I supplemented with sides of salsa, beans, and grilled onions from the expanded salsa bar.  The one negative note was the taco shells were heated on the same grill as the al pastor so they were a bit messy."}
{"text":"We needed a light lunch before attending an early afternoon show so we drove to this nearby restaurant.  Once again my wife and I each ordered a pair of al pastor street tacos.  I was surprised, read disappointed, to discover the meat had already been sliced and was chopped prior to adding it to our taco shells.  Also, in addition to crema, onions and cilantro, they are now adding canned pineapple. The salsa bar remains a positive, but I think we will be visiting a different restaurant in the future when we are in the mood for street tacos."}
{"text":"I ate there with my wife and we ordered 6 different meats of tacos and a mula. We added sour cream and cheese to our tacos. Mules are $4, and for those who don't know, it's basically a taco that gets topped with a 2nd tortilla. The tacos are 2.25. They are your typical small street size. That price isn't bad, but the tiny amount of sour cream was $1.50 for each taco. Cheese was also an extra charge. None of the meats were particularly good. The tacos weren't bad, but they also weren't great, very average. They just ended up being twice as expensive as they should have been.  The food was not worth the price, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here tonight after another taco shop had a line out the door. Not crowded, very friendly staff. The el pastor was delicious and definitely a must have item! Fountain soda prices for 4 was $11, a little steep considering how much they actually pay for the soda. Will come back again but will most likely just ask for a water."}
{"text":"This place would be better if they had more than 4 seats at the bar! They are always taken and I like ordering a couple of tacos at a time and have a few drinks.....not just piling a ton of tacos on my tray and grabbing one beer....then have to go stand in line again if I want more."}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco is one of the best taco shops I've tried in Vegas. I like them better than the always crowded and overrated Tacos El Gordo.

My two favorite meats for tacos are carne asada and al pastor, and they do both very well here. The asada is grilled over fire and then chopped, which gives it that great charred flavor. The pastor is shaved off of a rotisserie, and it is always juicy and perfectly seasoned. They have a huge selection of other meats to, and though I haven't tried them all, I do know they have excellent chicken and barbocoa. They also have vegan tacos, though I haven't tried them.

In addition to tacos you can get tostadas and other mexican dishes. One of my favorites is the vampiro, which is like two crispy quesadillas with meat in the middle like a sandwich. If you like crispy, meaty and cheesy you should try one.

The salsa bar could be a bit better and they could have some hotter offerings. The salsas are decent though and the addition of pinto beans at the bar more than makes up for it. I have rarely seen bean dip at a salsa bar but Taco Y Taco is the only place I have ever seen with whole beans at their bar. A very good accompaniment for your tacos.

The prices are about typical for a taco shop, with tacos at $2.50. Their taco size is also typical, so if you have a big appetite your going to spend a little money to get full.

If your a taco lover, this place should be on your list of places to try."}
{"text":"Move over Tacos El Gordo, hello Taco Y Taco!  Hands down the best tacos I've ever had.  I want to say they're authentic, but I'm a white-boy from NYC so I have no clue what authentic tacos are like.  However, I hear that many of the items on the list are quite authentic.  

The meats are all of top quality and juicy.  I love the sauce and beans bar.  The only item I wish I could have tried is the corn.  I'm not sure how I feel about mayo on corn, so I was a little apprehensive.  

The only negative that made me not give it five stars was the ordering process.  I was quite confused as to whether or not you order at one window and just move down the line or if you had to get behind each individual line for the different meat sections.  I want to eat my food hot and not have to stand three long lines.  In fact everyone seemed quit confused.  I had my two friends stand in each line so we can have our tacos hot and not have them go cold by waiting in each line."}
{"text":"I love coming here because the food is always amazing! I'm not Mexican, so getting to taste authentic Mexican tacos is an awesome experience to me! My favorites are the Al Pastor tacos and the Tripas (Fried beef entrails; don't knock em until you try em because they are really delicious!). 

They have basic chicken, pork, and beef tacos, as well as specialty tacos, such as the Al pastor, Tripas, and carnitas. They also have some veg options. My girlfriend is vegan so she gets the Azteca, which is cactus with cilantro, onions, avocado, just no cheese. The bar is huge as well so if you'd like a cocktail or a few shots with your food, you're in a good place. 

The restaurant itself is absolutely huge, you have a huge floor of tables and they also have upstairs seating with a view of the whole restaurant. The staff is also very nice and make every experience a good one. I love coming here and I will continue to come here for great tacos in a great atmosphere! I recommend all of you craving a taco come here and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in Vegas hands down. Their food is authentic and the employees are always friendly and enthusiastic. Typically I go to tacos el gordo but it's so far away from me, and it's always crowded no matter what time I go. When I heard about this I was so excited. And I was not disappointed at all. They even have elote!! Everything here is so bomb and fresh, and the ambience and set up is so up beat I love it."}
{"text":"Finally found a Mexican taco shop that had a variety of options for vegetarians. Nopales (cactus), sautéed mushrooms, sorizo and black beans not cooked in lard were just a few of the taco options. We also tried the Mexican elote (corn on the cob). It was delicious! 
Service was great and the guy who cooked our food was friendly. You order at the counter and then seat yourself. 
The only down side is that the seating area was dirty. Table were not wiped down and floor was dirty as well. 
Overall great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Yum! I had a craving for tacos and figured since Taco is in their name I would give it a try. I was amazed at how GOOD their tacos were! I had their Carne Asada and Shrimp Tacos and I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I love this taco spot! Im here all the time! Get tye el pastor! People are always friendly and the food is always on point! My gf loves the chicken tacos and they are one of the few on the area that serve chicken and el pastor."}
{"text":"Both locations have outstanding service. Both locations greet you with a friendly smile from the moment you walk in and they offer samples and such. 

Salsa bar is always FRESH and CLEAN. 
The food is always made to perfection. They have many options besides tacos and it's great. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Omg I can not get enough of this place. Everytime I come to Vegas I must visit this taco place. They have the absolute best tacos, bowls and burritos ever. I have been to many taco place but this one is the best!! The have amazing flavoring and seasoned to perfection. The ladies are so great and very friendly. The owners are sisters and have a few other locations. They're restaurant is a cute little spot with an upstairs. It's a very cut setting. It's a must try if your in Vegas!!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Talk about confusing, as someone stepping in here for the first time i wasn't sure where to go. Think it should be described a little better and be more clear as I wasn't ordering tacos so I passed that line since I just wanted nachos, but then others ordering tacos and going to the bowls and nachos area got in front of me? The food was great, but I did not enjoy the layout. Maybe at least the people working there can redirect you, as they didn't seem to care.

Update: I've come here several times after my initial visit and now I got the flow of how to order. This place is great."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. Best elotes. Best horchata. This place is my new fave taco spot and I'm coming here every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"First time. Got five different tacos each had a distinct combination and flavor so that was nice. Street corn is good but the hype via Yelp is overrated. Guess I've been to too many cities who serve real street corn and it's grilled. The cooks behind the counters were cool and helped me decide. However either girl at the cashier didn't say a peep to me which was really awkward. We just rang up my food, I tipped them, asked them for to go tops on the pickled carrots and all without one sound coming from them...weird. Lol. Nevertheless I might come back."}
{"text":"You must trust me when I say. Sit at the bar. Relax. Order a cocktail with 2 al pastor vampiros with everything. All I can say is.,.... Your welcome."}
{"text":"These tacos are phenomenal oh my god!!!!! So amazing and the sauce bar in the middle is great. The inside is so cute and it's just a great place."}
{"text":"Clean and fresh! This place looks like a hotel lobby but serves up some of the best Mexican food I've enjoyed in a long time. Was at first worried about how fancy the place looked...I prefer my tacos from a more grimy or dingy looking spot...gives it flavor I feel. Ordered the breakfast burrito, ended up with what appeared to be a massive meal that could have easily been shared and kept me full all day, and less than $7! Fresh meat right off the grill, made to order. They'll serve you up some samples if simply ask. They have it all...a wide variety of meats (everything from nose to tail it seems like) and veggies. The salsa bar is easily the most impressive I've ever seen...fresh made salsas, fresh cut veggies, grilled veggies still steaming, and boiling beans. The homemade horchata was unbelievable. Service was a little slow, which is fine considering that they basically build your meal from scratch. Looking forward to going back for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for our co-workers, the total came to $180. We only received half of the order on paper plates with aluminum foil on top. When we called in to have it rectified, they told us to come into the restaurant because they are not going to deliver it. 
When we asked to speak with a manager, they told us to call back tomorrow morning, a Sunday....

Taco y Taco... please get your shit together."}
{"text":"I love that they have a vegetarian option for me. This is hands down my favorite Taco shop ever. :)"}
{"text":"I come from the east coast and I've never had street tacos like theirs out there. They are so good, and the fact that they put diced pineapple on them."}
{"text":"I thought the food was just okay. I would not go out of my way to go there again. The lines sucks but i underdtand why it's that way."}
{"text":"Place is clean and inviting. Great customer service and the food was very delicious. I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is awesome alpastor is AMAZINGGGGGGG. But the dude behind the bar CAN NOT pour a beer it honestly brings a tear to my eye for all the anchor steam he wasted while pouring ONE BEER, I wanted to jump behind the bar and show him how to pour a beer or put my mouth under the tap."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me. It is an interesting concept and layout. Staff was nice and the place seemed clean. Food was good, but could use some seasoning. Lots of choices for different types of tacos, in addition to other favorites (burritos, nachos, etc). Overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and of course love the food! Truly authentic Mexican food! I've had pretty much everything on their menu and I've never been disappointed, they make their salsas in-house! The food is always so fresh and of course delicious!"}
{"text":"The only time I was there the guy didn't help me. He literally called on the people behind me tohelp them even though I was next in line. Management if you read this if your employees treat paying customers like this I'm actually surprised you're still in business."}
{"text":"Worst Service . We ordered a party platter & they refused to give plates . Extremely rude service . Will not return ."}
{"text":"KILLER FOOD!!!

I love their tacos. Fresh, really good meat and great ingredients. I love the chicken, carnitas and al pastor tacos. The toppings are yummy. 

Come get some!!!"}
{"text":"The first time we went it was excellent. This last time the meat was a little dry and the veggies were bitter (cucumber and radish) :( ."}
{"text":"Left the strip to show my company  of  of 8 that there is great food over at Taco Y Taco by our home, got there about 12:45 and we went there because they close at 2:00 am.Great food! Only thing that the bean and salsa bar was unavailable because the manager said they were ready to close! At least an hour early! Wow!"}
{"text":"Who's up for Mexican Food? I am!! 

We parked, entered the place and tried to figure their ordering system. Basically, it's a food court. Get your food, then pay. 
I've had their famous el vampiro (my friends and i didnt really care for this. It's like corn tortilla quesadilla and taco had a baby), al pastor (meat was flavorful and tender, but I got distracted how the sauce looked like. It seemed like alien green, contrasted by the red meat and yellow pineapples), carne asada (it was ok) buche (so moist and yummy) lengua and crispy intestines (i picked on the intestines and didnt eat the taco) 

Extra salsa, limes, pickled veggies are in the middle if you care for them.

Anyhow... I am a regular because this place makes mean ELOTES!! Yes, elote con mayonesa, con queso y chile!!! It feels like I'm almost home (I lived in a bordertown in Texas). I dream about eating its goodness!"}
{"text":"Love their food, hate their ordering process. Just discovered their Gran Taco!! Yum! Friendly service and cool ambiance. You can't go wrong! Just have patience with their ordering system."}
{"text":"Oh my gawd!!!!! These tacos are incredible! And the venue is pretty sweet too. Everyone who works here is friendly. The Al Pastor tacos.... mmmmm....."}
{"text":"I LOVE tacos. This taco y taco location is clean and has a bunch of options. My personal favorite is the suadero (beef) and elote (corn). 

The layout here is a little disorganized and you sometimes have to fight your way through to the front, but its totally worth it. Taco Y Taco (this location and the one on Tropicana) is by far the cleanest taqueria/mexican restaurant I've been to. Great happy hour deals M-F too!"}
{"text":"Yelpers, you haven't lived if you haven't been to taco y taco.

You know you've eaten somewhere fabulous when you're itching to write a review while your man is driving you home after such a great meal! 

Tacos y tacos is a clean, authentic taco shop that offers a variety of meats including the typical carne asada and al pastor to the tripas, lengua, and cabeza. 

The staff here is REALLY friendly and everything is made to order - including the corn tortillas. Be sure to tip the jar at each station because they are very patient and helpful to the new folks. 

I'll have to come back to review the other items they offer but I'm sure they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!!!  This is a new favorite for me.  I had the al pastor tacos with everything and they were amazing!! I also had the barbacoa tacos...also fantastic. My boyfriend really liked it too.
The service was quick and friendly and the restaurant was clean.  This is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"All the stories of deliciousness I've heard about Taco Y Taco were true! The tacos taste amazing & they have a ton of meat options. My favs were al pastor & chicharrones w/ everything on top. The elote (Mexican street corn) is fantastic & the atmosphere is cool too. Thankfully it wasn't super busy when I went in, so I didn't have any issues but I here that it can be hectic ordering sometimes when it gets packed. Busy or not the food would be worth the wait to me."}
{"text":"The staff makes me smile which is always awesome. Ordering here is a little awkward, not your average place. They can cut the meat in front of you and you can order whatever you like then walk up to the register. It's kind of like a buffet but a served buffet. Different. 

They have a little bar, seating on a first and second floor. Everyone seemed relaxed and willing to help. I ordered a carne quesadilla and there was just a tad too much cheese for my taste. No big deal I can ask for less next time.

I will return!"}
{"text":"Well run place with REAL Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Move over tacos el gordo.Found my new taco spot..and they serve beer..whaatt!! Would have taken a picture of the vampiro,nachos, or shrimp burrito, I ordered, but all that was left was my modelo bottle and guilt."}
{"text":"I love this place and everyone I take here loves this place. The food is so good I quickly forget about it being a bit over priced."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to come eat and have a good drink! Everyone is always so nice, and the food never disappoints! The price is fair too! Love when they have a DJ too gives such a fun experience!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy my meals here which is why when I'm on this side of town I try to stop in well tonight was the absolute worst Mexican food experience of my life. I asked the lady what do you recommend the shredded beef or the carne asada..she said shredded beef..ok I'll have that with the lime cilantro rice. Wait a few minutes here comes my burrito which btw was just sitting there. They have no way of calling a number or a name I was asked for neither anyways got a few things from the salsa bar which looked pretty nasty. Anyways I bite into the burrito and the rice is so stale I thought I broke a tooth on it..so I go back and ask them to remake it which they do..this time with Spanish rice..again they give me carne asada when I asked for shredded beef..anyways I take like 3 or 4 bites and every piece of meat is disgusting gristle infested with arteries it was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten..so I'm spitting out bite after bite finally I was like this is bs...i go back to the counter and tell the girl  I want my money back then she makes me wait while she tries to get her owner on the phone..There is NO MANAGER on duty to resolve a simple case of them serving over priced garbage..she saw me throw away 3/4 of the other burrito and then she says call this number  to speak to the owner..then she says try and reach her on Instagram? Wtf? You try her on instagram...ridiculous! Serving me over priced and poor quality food and I don't get a refund? This is a very simple case and should have been handled right there..i told her forget it and told her I would not return. To me they did nothing but steal from me...very poor customer service..next time I wanna eat like this ill skip the restaurant and head straight to the dumpster....shame on you !"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a pretty picky food eater but a huge nacho fan so decide to go try their nachos based off the awesome reviews this place has had. 

I also got for my friend an asada taco, an asada vampiro and some Mexican corn. 

This place is a little hard to find, I literally drove by it twice and finally had to get directions from Siri. I walk in and the place is pretty clean, am greeted by a few employees working the stations and make my way to the nacho one. Being my first time here I was a little confused but the guy behind the counter explained he would take care of a few of the items and to go to the other window for the asada stuff. This place is very well organized which I can appreciate. So after he's done making my food he goes to the other person I ordered from gets the rest of my order an walks it up front. Talk about good service. Everyone was smiling and I was in and outta there in less then 5 minutes. 

So the food:
I may or may not have accidentally (okay no accident at all) ate my friends asada taco on the way home. I mean, they did still have the vampiro and I immediately wante to go back and get like, 5 more (though i figured id save that for another trip).They were amazing just the right amount of flavor.

The nachos didnt impress me look wise, they kinda seemed pretty bland but as soon as I bit into them I quickly changed my mind. They were awesome. Not the best chicken I've ever had but not the worst and the guacamole could use some more flavor but overall you get more then your money's worth.

The corn is standard Mexican corn. It was okay though I don't recommend getting it to go...it loses most of its flavor in the foil they wrap it in and u just end up with mayo corn.

The vampiro...if u haven't tried it, do. I had a bite of my friends and also amazing. Meat was cooked just right, had a great flavor and only around $3. 

So would I recommend this place? Definitely. Under $15 for all that stuff means the price is right and the food is more then worth it. Some other places have worse nachos for the same price as this whole meal for 2. Ill be back next week if it can wait that long since fortunately/unfortunately this place is just down the street from me. I wouldn't mind trying their asada fries or quesadillas but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be disappointed with anything you order."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great food, great staff, always clean.  DJ spinning, and margaritas are AMAZING. Worth the visit. We enjoy stopping by for a light lunch after church on the way home."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas: I'm a psuedo regular, and there at the very least bi-weekly if not weekly.

It occupies that perfect space between Tacos el Gordo- authentic, gloriously affordable real non-tex-mex tacos you can't really get outside of the southwest, and Mercadito- fancier riffs on said authentic glory for a premium price. 

The tacos there are SO good, and SO cheap...its easy to justify coming back again and again and again. And the fun, clean atmosphere make it easy to lure your \"Chipotle only\" friends and family into experiencing real mexican.

If you come here for the first time, do yourself a huge favor. Grow a pair. Be adventurous. Don't order the chicken. Try lengua, or suadero! You will be amazed at what you have been missing out on. The carnitas and Al pastor are pretty goddamn amazing, if you need a comfort blanket, but try something from window 2 you're not sure you'll like. At worst, you waste 2 bucks.  

At best you open up a Wide and Wonderful World of Offal... 

Oh, and lest I forget; Delerium Tremens on tap (you heard me, tap.) and a house Margarita that features jalapeno infused tequila. And corn! Get the corn! And the Guacamole---oh hell just go. Often."}
{"text":"Holy Guacamole.


Everything about Taco y Taco is JUST RIGHT.

This place is always good. There are so many options for just one place-- and as a vegan, you will never run out of creative things to try!

I got the soyrizo tostada, and then I went ALL OUT at the Salsa bar in the middle-- with amazing beans, salsas, radishes, and onions. 

My biggest recommendation, is to go here when you are REALLY REALLY HUNGRY- & you will leave happy."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine who was once a local of the area told me to try this spot out because he said the tacos are really good. So I took his word and decided to try out all the different tacos they had among 4 people including my self.
  The Al pastor was too good. It really had an interesting mixture of veggies and the salsa they used to make it there own identity. The 4 stars goes  entirely to the Al pastor it's self.
   All the other tacos was bit too salty. I wouldn't order any of the other tacos again.
I highly recommend the Al pastor, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall, I would give this place 4 stars but there was a lady working today that was extremely rude. I was getting a to go order for someone in my household that couldnt leave the house and I didn't know what she wanted. The lady behind the counter looked at me frustrated even though no one was in line behind me and then she had the audacity to say \"next time have your order ready.\" It was a last minute order and I didn't know what she wanted. It was completely uncalled for. So 3 stars because of rude wait staff."}
{"text":"Thanks for the hook-up, Yelp!  This place rocks.  I had three small tacos, chips & salsa, and a drink for under $10.  The carnitas were tender, the carne asada was great, and the pastor was intensely seasoned (the way I like it.)  Second time I got the azteca special taco with nopales, and a pastor burrito.  Again, with chips, guac, and a drink for under $10.  Buying chips for a dollar is a great bargain with that huge salsa bar.  And unlimited fountain drink refills with Coke Zero -- high five!!  The seating area is huge, and clean, and the music is blaring -- which isn't awesome for intimate discussions, but entertaining nonetheless.  The order system is definitely confusing, I never know who to ask for what -- they all talk to you while you're looking at the menu, so you feel like you can order from anybody, but I guess you're supposed to order the items at the station they're assigned?  *Shrug*"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas, hands down. Al Pastor tacos with Mexican style corn on the cob will have your mouth watering for more."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, really well done, freshly made in front of you. Sure the ordering process is a little confusing at first and the vegetarian options aren't very well advertised. Also I find the the increasingly small water cups to be a little annoying as I can only get a sip of water. Not sure how having tiny water cups saves much more then a few cents. Also the salsa bar while huge offering a wide selection the new containers for salsa are tiny. Good quality food though, you can't underestimate a great taco. Five stars for quality!"}
{"text":"My nephews and niece wanted Mexican for dinner and they mentioned this place.  I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it. I'm assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn't.  Qualify of meat gets a C.  Flavor gets a D.  Service gets an F.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"All meats are worth trying: Chicken, beef tongue and pork were good, especially beef. They have good vegetarian options too. Soy imitation meat is above average but not great. Sautéed mushroom tacos were great. Both corn and flour taco shells are very fresh and soft. Street corn looked tempting while they were being prepared, I will try them next time. Plenty of salsa and sauce options. Ordering process left me confused for a while."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. Food is authentic and they have a wide variety of meat selection. Great location, very spacious and clean. Their Al pastor and corn are to die for. Great salsa selection. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best place to get tacos in Las Vegas! My favorite by far is the al pastor. So tasty I could eat them everyday! I also love their Mexican corn. I usually also order guac and chips as well. They also have a variety of other tacos you can choose from. Reasonable prices and everyone there is friendly. You may have to wait in line depending on what time you go there because it can be busy around lunch and dinner. A must try for any taco lover."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite taco shop in Vegas!

I remember I tried this place right when it had opened. Their service was slow and so disorganized that by the time I got my food I was so annoyed and swearing that I'd never come back again. That was until I took my first bite of the Al pastor taco that I ordered. As soon as I tasted the food, all those thoughts immediately went away. The tacos here are authentic and delicious and so worth the trouble!

My go to is the Al pastor tacos and second in line are the carne asada. 

Good quality meats, freshly made, oily tortillas, nice and spicy salsas. 

To drink I like their Jamaica (hibiscus tea) , it tastes real unlike some places that use the bland fountain version. 

A few ago I was craving tacos and I seriously drove 18 miles across town to eat here LOL. 
3 tacos later, I left so happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place easily beats TEG!!  Try the Vampiro style tacos.  Vampiro is like a tostada that is smothered in cheese, carne asada and avacado.  So good!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have eaten since living in Las Vegas and the corn-on-the-cob is to die for."}
{"text":"Ask for a shrimp quesadilla and they tell me they have no shrimp.  Really shocking because the woman ahead and the gentlemen behind me ordered shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever had Mexican food I didn't enjoy eating, but this was nothing stand-out special. They have an a la carte- type ordering system.. & it's also backwards.. so it's kinda confusing, but they do have decent prices & occasional specials. You can also find live music here on select nights."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but the service and ordering system is so awful that it drives me away. Every time I have gone in, the staff is just not paying attention. They are just chatting and goofing off behind the counter, they get my order wrong, they ignore me, etc. It is just annoying. 

Then they make you stand under the \"meat\" type sign to place your order. So if you want chicken, stand where the chicken sign is, but then if you want something with pork, you have to go wait over by that sign now. I just want to order everything in one place, because each time I have come and ordered different items, the staff just gets confused.

The food is good, the price is a bit much for what it is, and the service is awful. I might try the other location, because it has potential."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite taco place in Vegas.  The barbacoa, carnitas and buche tacos were all awesome.  Where most similar places are kind of greasy; this place was not.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried it after co-workers raved about it. Have to say that the set up is a little confusing and you have to hurry and place your order in because people have no common sense and cut in front of you knowing you were standing there trying to place an order. 
Anywho....besides that the food was actually really good. I got a chicken bowl with black beans, peppers, lettuce,  guacamole , and a little cheese. The chicken has so much flavor. I was craving more! My boyfriend ordered 3 carnitas tacos and said it was actually really good. Will we go there again. Yes. But not during rush hour."}
{"text":"Anytime we drive to Las Vegas, our first stop is Taco Y Taco! It has become our favorite taco spot in LV! Before we leave back to Cali, we stop by Taco Y Taco again.
Great food and it is very affordable!"}
{"text":"Pretty great hole in the wall  had the carne Asada vampira  yummy. Also the guacamole and chips were great. Fabulous coke machine. Wished I would of had the corn on the cob. Fir sure next time in Henderson"}
{"text":"Finally tried Taco &Y Taco and glad we did.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were confused.  We had no idea where to go to place our order; there are multiple lines....  

Hubby had three baracoa tacos, I had two fish tacos (I ordered one, but there was a communication oops) and an ear of corn.  We ordered chips and guacamole, as well as two glasses of Model Negra on draft.  Cost was $32.

The corn was great; will definitely order it again.  The chips weren't special, hot or salty.  The guacamole was just okay.  My fish tacos were surprisingly spicy but I didn't see or taste any fish.  Hubby liked his baracoa tacos.

We'll definitely be back and assume that we will eventually figure out the protocol for placing our orders."}
{"text":"Eastern is such a nice facility & the staff is Friendly. A huge salsa bar. Good prices!"}
{"text":"Without a double Cinco Estrellas!  How can this not be?

a. Authentic - My god. I have not been to any Mexican place so far in Las Vegas, where you can get mini tacos like you do in Mexico City or Guadalajara. I was immediately fascinated!

b.  Types of Food

- Buritto and large tacos (gran taco

- All that in a  bowl if you don't want the tortilla

- Small Tacos - Yes!  Simply elegant.

- The meats asada, pollo, tripas, barbacoa, al pastor (right off the rotisserie), suadero, trompa, canitas, buche, lengua, chorizo, cabeza, cesos, chicharron.  Man, if you like types of meat that are not normal, this is the place. I had the lengua (tongue), Cesos (brain) and tripas (tripe).  It was all so tasty, tender and subtle in flavor.  Amazing and delicate at same time.

c.  Vegetarians - Yep, they serve vegetarians here and have some very nice alternatives for you.  I did not try any of them as I was devouring the odd / weird meat tacos.

d.  Location - Easy to find in an oblong store on Trop and Pecos.  Decent space for seating.

e.  Extras - Nice salsa bar, although I had a hard time to ID what was spicy.  Soda Fountain and plenty of seating.

f.  Get ready for lines, and know that if you want buritto or a large taco, to stand at the main line.  However, if you wan other small tacos, they have three other lines where depending on you meat, there is a specific line for you.  So, there are actually 4 lines, but it is not easy to know this...

GK says, for some seriously authentic tacos, try out this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow, another Taco Y Taco and this one in Henderson.  Love it.  I am a huge fan of really authentic tacos and I love the selection.  Here are some hints:

a. If your idea or Mexican food is Cafe Rio, Nacho Daddy, Del Taco, Taco Bell, or having a burrito or chips and salsa, it is best for you to stay at those restaurants, because this is NOT going to match your idea of Mexican Food.

b.  The meat here is absolutely fantastic:

-Buche - Pork Stomach
-Carnitas - Braised Pork
-Suedero - Beef from the upper leg / lower belly
-Cesos - The thinking part of the cow
-Lengua - Tongue
-Cabeza - Meet from the head of the cow, so it has many things, as you can imagine.
-Pibil - Slow Roasted Pork
-Al Pastor - Love it, they shave the meat directly from the spit.
-Taco Asada - Grilled Beef
-Chorizo - Pork Sausage
-Mulas - I guess you can say this is a \"slider\" but more like a taco mini quesadilla.

c.  Prices are all about 2.25 per taco.  they also had other items here, breakfast burritos, and some other items other than tacos.

d. Salsa Bar has great hot and mild sauces as well as fresh salsa.  This was very tasty.

e.  The ambiance is the same exact set up from when this place was a pub called The Republic.  This means all the decor and details are not too authentic.

f.  Music - They have a great set up to play loud music.  I felt it was too loud.

g.  Be careful - going during normal hours, the long lines her overwhelming.

GK says, try this place out."}
{"text":"Authentic street tacos. So much flavor! I love all of the different sauces that you can try and they add even more flavor to the tacos. All of the green ones were my favorite. Can't wait to go back and try something else there."}
{"text":"I love how they offer vegetarian options for none meat eaters. I tried the soy-rizo taco and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Order tacos at the right bar and everything else at the left. Then slide on over to the cashier to pay. Pretty confusing layout since the cashier protrudes out closest to the entrance.

Everything is customizable as you go along the food bar when they prepare your food and they have many additional options of salsa and add-ons at their salsa bar. Had delicious lengua tacos, but my carne asada taco was way too salty that I barely even touched it. Chicken nachos were also very good and only $5 for for decently large sized portion during their happy hour. The other drink and food items on their happy hour also looked very enticing. 

Pretty nice atmosphere, especially when compared to LA for street-style Mexican food."}
{"text":"I never give 5 to most places. But this place high quality ingredients, good service, good beverage selection too.  We were full but couldn't stop eating!  I'm Hispanic and my company has a pacific island-Portuguese-French-Spanish-Asian pallet. Highly recommend it, suggest you try the mulas but the soft tacos were amazing."}
{"text":"We love this place, but the lines are so incredibly dumb. If this place is busy forget about it! They need to make it one line and get what you need from each station. Instead I have to wait in multiple lines and your food gets cold and people in lines next to you are coughing and breathing all over your tray. I will never understand why this place has three separate lines for different foods and then a checkout line. If they fixed that I would be in here every week! And make a kids menu!! Bean burritos and quesadillas at the least!  I hate paying $8 for each of kids to have a bean burrito! Food is great though, just don't go during a busy time or you will leave there so annoyed!"}

I am never disappointed whenever I come here. Whether it is during lunch or dinner, this place never disapppoints. I am glad that this place is open so that I do not have to have a drunken night on the strip and stop off at Tacos El Gordo.

The establishment is clean and the staff always nice. Need to stop off one of these days and just plop down at the bar and drink with tacos in hand! Haha.

Don't let the size of the tacos fool you. 2 will fill you. 3 it gets a little too tight. 4 would be an overkill and be prepared to throw the towel in. So with that said, I got the chicharon, lengua, tripas, and carnitas. Also got an elotes.

Suffice it to say, I got my #tacotuesday fix"}
{"text":"I have eaten her a few times .. and they are very delicious .. so many items to choose from. Restaurant  looks clean and workers are friendly"}
{"text":"This is yet another place decently close to me that I should have visited a lot sooner.  As it were, once I finally went, I went 3 times in less than a week....

The first time, I had 2 gran tacos and a side of street corn.  The gran tacos are BIG, $3.50 each and fully loaded with cheese, meat, fresh pico, and avocado.  They are fantastic.  You pay $1.00 upcharge for seafood, which I did because I tried the shrimp.  They are loaded, in fact a couple of shrimp fell out and I still had shrimp in every bite.  The shrimp and carne asada are heavily seasoned, but not overly so.  The wife had shrimp and chicken, and I tried a bit of the chicken.  This may be the best flavored chicken I've ever had at a taco joint.  It had spice, but didn't turn my wife off, as she doesn't like heat as much as I do.  The street corn was fantastic, but messy.  So, I would recommend eating this while sitting down or next to a roll of paper towels.  

The salsa bar is maybe the best I've seen at a taco place.  8 different sauces, pickled veggies, and a pepper onion mix that they could sell for $3.00 and it would be a bargain.  You can really dress them how you like.  

I then tried a chorizo breakfast burrito (the next morning).  Probably the best breakfast burrito I've had in Las Vegas, which puts it in the running for best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  Only $3.99 and huge.  Packed with eggs, cheese, potatoes, meat and flavor.  The entire burrito was wrapped in foil which kept it piping hot.  I tried the bacon one on the next trip, but didn't like it as much.  Don't get me wrong, it was excellent, but the chorizo is where it's at breakfast wise.

I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and the kitchen.  The kitchen appeared to be very organized, and the employees are friendly and helpful.  This is a fantastic place all around, can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open!! So glad I found out it was open and went there for lunch. Now I'm not much of a meat eater so I can't tell you about that but what I can tell you is that the food is fresh. 

We had the carne asada fries, I ordered it without the meat. Fries covered in shredded cheese, guacamole and tomatoes. The lady taking my order had the cook come over so I could tell him exactly what I wanted. He was very nice and made it just the way I asked. My Mom had a carne asada taco and she said it was good, but they fry the tortilla and she said it was greasy. My favorite thing is the salsa bar they have. So many things to choose from. We had all of this and 2 drinks plus chips for $15! Awesome!

It's really cute inside, the staff are friendly and the food is great. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. It is self serve and had a salsa bar. Reasonable prices and authentic Mexican food.. Will eat here again"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I went there last night. I ordered 8 carne asada tacos, the meat was not cooked all the way,  no seasoning was added, and the guacamole was brown!"}
{"text":"I was invited with friends to try this place and now it is one of my favorite places to go! I love it here. The food is absolutely amazing. It's also very affordable too. I give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. I am only docking a star because the lines are super confusing. The first time we went, we were in line over 20 minutes because people kept getting in front of where we were supposed to go. We have finally figured it out, I think?

I like that they have vegetarian options for tacos. I don't eat much meat, so I was especially happy about this. I like the queso fresco one. My husband likes the carne asada tacos, and my son likes the carne asada burrito. I LOVE the Mexican street corn. This is actually the first time in my life I have ever had it, and I was impressed. Yum!

They do have a beer selection, and also Jurritos to drink. Or you can get regular soda. The seating is pretty spread out. You can sit up or downstairs. They have a cart with things like salsa and spicy carrots, like Robertos. 

Overall, a little pricey. The lady last night also charged me an extra $2 for a bottled water that we didn't order. Good food though!"}
{"text":"Very often locals tend to judge picky but with the mexican eatery that seats 40 plus comfortably Taco y Taco is making its way in the ranks as one of the powers in classic hand rolled tacos in Las Vegas.  Bring you're appetite and challenge the crew to make the best taco you can experience, wonderfully capable cooks who only know hard work and great flavor."}
{"text":"I'm upset because I came in at like 11:20 am and was told \"give me seven minutes\". Which has never happened to me before. So I went outside and walked around for a minute and came back and now there are 15 people in line before me. That's why I came early ... To beat the lunch crowd! Then, two guys come to the front of the line from sitting down and order like ten tacos by giving hand signals to the employees. I'm like, uh, let me in on that. Turns out, the al pastor isn't even ready. So I left. The lack of communication, lack of preparedness, and the cutting. Can't handle it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Their al pastor is the best I have ever experienced. I usually stick to the tacos but this time I ventured and ordered the gran taco and wow was that a great choice. I hear a lot of feedback about the confusion of ordering. We have sat at the bar and learned that it's just easier to order from the bartender, Eddie is the best!! Even great to talk with, I learned a lot about tequila and mezcal because that's his specialty."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and an amazing atmosphere. Ordering here can be very intimidating especially during peak times.  So please make sure you are in the line for the item or meat choice you'ld like to eat.

  I've only had the tacos the several times I've been here and typically start in the line for the Pastor,  then move over the Lengua which is in another line so if you go in with friends you can cut down on your wait time.  Street corn is also available and makes a very tasty compliment to your order. 

 Beverage choices range from Coca Cola in the  bottle to fountain drinks as well as several local beers and the traditional mexican beers as well (Pacifico, Corona, Dos XX's) 

Seating on the side patio is typically empty and where I prefer on busy nights as most patrons are waiting and scrambing for seating inside and upstairs.

Enjoy and make everyday a Taco y Taco day!"}
{"text":"Yum! Love the pastor! Everything is very good! Plus $3 corona draft for happy hour can't be beat with your favorite tacos."}
{"text":"First time here. Was in the mood for a burrito so we ordered ONE arne asada burrito and we're given many options for what we wanted to add - 2 types of rice, 2 types of beans, grilled veggies, 2 types of cheese,  several salsas, plain mashed avocado or guacamole, and more! The burrito is REALLY BIG!! Plenty for two people especially since there are many sides and appetizers to go with. Not in love with the texture of the beef so next time we come we will probably order an assortment of \"street\" tacos. They look really good! They offer a wide variety of proteins (5 different types of beef including tripe, tongue, \"cabeza\", BBQ & Carne asada; al pastor prepped pork as well as chorizo, carnitas, buche, and chicharon; chicken and beef; grilled fish and shrimp; they also offer multiple vegetarian options.  In addition to the aforementioned tacos and burritos they offer bowls and \"granny tacos\". They have a nice salsa bar with 6 different salsas, grilled and pickled vegetables. At 2 in the afternoon the place was \"lunchtime\" busy, on the noisy side with recorded music overhead and an upstairs dining room. Finally,  for drinks they offer fountain sodas, Mexican bottled sodas and have a FULL bar. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Tasty affordable Mexican in a nicer than usual space.  The carnitas was delicious and the lengua had that lengua tang.  The habanero salsa is a perfect blend of heat and flavor.  

My only complaint is that the portions are huge.  I'm ready for a nap."}
{"text":"This was a tough one.  I'd give the food four or maybe even five stars, but the loud music makes it a horrible experience.

They make great food, or at least they used to, but their stupid, loud DJ is killing their business.  Because of the loud music, we despise eating there, no matter how great the food is.  Too bad. Otherwise the Mrs. and I would probably eat there every week -- Or we would if the food is still as good as it was the last time we went, which was was last spring.  As it is, we just won't go there anymore  We went a couple times last spring, but we won't be back.

Ambience is kind of like a Wendy's, but with really loud music.

Really bad management decision.  They had good food and could have been a success, but ruined their business with that loud DJ.  Must be an investor's nephew or something.

UPDATE MAY 2015: 

I went again last week.  The food was as good as ever.  The al pastor tacos are amazing.  The atmosphere is still awful.  But the food is amazing.  Changing review to four stars.  Four stars is generous considering how awful the atmosphere is, but the food, the food . . . it's so GOOD!

UPDATE MARCH 2016

DJ was there last week, but he was much quieter, which was nice.  You could have a conversation in the restaurant now.

Food is still stupendous, and now they have stupendous microbrews on tap -- Try the Red's Rye PA or the Toaster Pastry.  The Al Pastor tacos and the mexican street corn are da' bomb.  Loving this place.

If they could just get the ambience less cafeteria-like -- Maybe have a bigger bar, for starters..  Oh, but the food and the beer is so, so GOOD!"}
{"text":"Great  trendy looking  place. Love their  tacos, corn on the cob and nachos!  Definitely  recommend"}
{"text":"First time in this location, got in line for el pastor an a Brazilian guy was serving ( he was covering for the taco man) , then went to the carne asada lane and a Mexican guy was there, walk to the salad lane and an American guy (I believed) was working the salads it was United Nations in one place they were nice  but when I got to the register , the girl was on the phone and had me waiting there the whole conversation without telling me to hold on or acknowledged I was there , after she just rang me up I ask some questions and her answers were very blunt like she wasn't there, at the salsa bar I Looked for plastic containers for my to go order and ask the girl in the salsa bar and she said she didn't know that she was new, so I go back to the register and ask the cashier (I thought she was) where do I put the salsa and she said is there and I said no covers? And then she said oh take this ones and hand me to go plastic containers but I guess she forgot to put them in the bag., I'm assuming.  When I was leaving I noticed that she moved to the bar area so I'm assuming she was the bartender, I did wait to get her attention while she was on the phone so of course by the time I got home my food was cold, I live super close and still I had to reheat all the food , the guacamole was already brownish ( I did noticed it was a bit brown when the taquero was serving me) so that was my fault for not telling him to give me new one, the al pastor Mula was extremely greasy, I literally have stomach pain, it was really bad, never coming back,  for the taqueros super nice but the food and the service at the register killed it completely, hoping owners look at this and take action and either train them better and show them the meaning of customer service and urgency."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this taco place. I've been to their Tropicana location and this one is much nicer with Uber hipster vibes. My favorite is the al pastor (grilled pork) so I usually just get all al pastor tacos. It comes with pineapple salsa avocado salsa cilantro and onions. It's not the best tacos I've ever had. The meat could be a little more flavorful but the salsa and crispy ness of the meat makes up for that.  Overall I think it's delicious. 

Their corn on the cob is also super good. Comes with mayo Parmesan cheese and pepper. Get it when corn is in season so it's super juicy and not overly dry. 

I also love that this place has a salsa bar. They have a variety of salsas and toppings including grilled onions, jalapeños and carrots and radishes.  Henderson is a little out of my way but I can see myself making the trip again for these tacos!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this taco place.  If you come Tuesdays the chicken and al pastor tacos are $2 bucks each.  The tacos are relatively small but they do give a decent amount of meat.  What I love the most is their salsa bar.  Salsa bars always get me.  The variety of condiments and colorful salsas all laid out always sings to my heart.  I loved the flavor of my al pastor tacos.  I think its comparable to tacos el gordo.  The meat was flavorful and tender and compliments well with the green salsa.  

I also ordered the jamaica drink.  Its not that sweet which I like, and it has this tart pruney flavor.  Beware though cause it stains your teeth, tongue, hands, clothes, basically anything it comes in contact with."}
{"text":"I went get a few months ago and I'm sure glad I did.  It is so yummy.  I had the spicy meat taco and it was good.  Came back a few weeks later and got a burrito, it was so good and much better than Chipolte.  
My only complaint is that they need to explain what the meat it. Majority of it I have never heard of and maybe get a wider range of soda or add tea to drink.  
Overall a great and inexpensive place to eat yummy tacos or burritos and street corn. Open late"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the experience. At first it is a little confusing as to how to order but once you figure it all out it is all well worth it. The price was not great but the great food and the unique atmosphere made up for that."}
{"text":"Yoooooooooo. Okay so tacos el gordo is my love, but my best friend literally raved about this place so of course I had to try. Wow let me sayyyyyy move over tacos el gordo!!! There's an incentive to go here, because there's seafood tacos :) 
The only complaint was that their elote was lacking in flavor.
Anyway.... Pretty good stuff peeps!! Try it!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Taco Taco!!!! This is my absolute favorite place to come with the hubby for my favorite vegetarian burrito, street corn, and fish tacos. My boyfriend absolutely loves the al pastor tacos with the pineapple on top. All the workers here are so friendly and I have never had a bad experience. The prices are very reasonable and I have had a great time at both locations. It's surprising this place is in a bad area and the other location is very luxurious. I will be back for you Taco Y Taco :) thank you for the amazing food and incredible service!!"}
{"text":"I've heard things about Taco y Taco, but I'm never quite near a location. We decided to grab a quick lunch here to seize the opportunity. 

We settled on getting tacos - 

Al Pastor -  it was on the sweeter side of marinades and a bit leaner meat. That can be a pro/con depending what you are into, but I happened to enjoy it. 

Cabeza - this was really good, they chopped it up well so that you get a even distribution of the meat and fatty bits. 

Lengua - If you aren't sure about lengua bits, this version may be easier to swallow as it was shredded up. 

The one thing I wasn't expected was it was gonna be dressed with salsa already. I mean, I suppose that's not a bad thing except I saw there were other sauces at the condiment bar that I wanted to try. Just FYI in case you are one who is spice sensitive (al pastor salsa had kick) or want to try various sauce that \"everything\" on it meant that. 

Prices weren't bad at $2.25, but are definitely higher than street tacos as they gotta pay rent on this large space. 

I enjoyed their horchata. It wasn't the usual Bang brand mix, but seems homemade! Lovely creaminess and just the right amount of spices...Yum! 

I did enjoy the tacos so I would be back, but only if it's not busy. I absolutely hate this style of ordering at stations when it's busy as it just gets to be a confusing and everyone getting in each others way."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! Came here for the first time on Cinco de Mayo, and it was jam packed. 

My friend and I found a place at the bar to enjoy, and we definitely did. I got 1 al pastor & 1 pork belly. So delicious!! Came back here today for lunch with some friends and the experience was pretty much the same. Great food, jam packed with people. This time I tried the elote (corn on the cob). Make sure to get it with everything on it! The al pastor too - the pineapple counter acts the heat and makes it so good!

The lines seem to confuse everyone though. At each window, you find a different kind of taco/food. So just pay attention otherwise you'll be in the wrong line.

If it was closer to me, I'd definitely be here all the time. I'd for sure recommend this to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Wow I don't know what was wrong with this visit... in the past the tacos were good but this time I had a chicken burrito & it tasted like a salt bath... Taco Y Taco needs to cut down on the salt"}
{"text":"This place has great tacos, in a very cool environment.  Walk up to counter, order food, and sit, but still restaurant quality!  They have a cool club vibe going on inside-very cool place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhh myyyyy God!!! I don't know if I was hungry or what but by far this has to be one of my favorite places I've gone for tacos and it was my first time haha. I went with a number of friends and got the opportunity to try a number of their entries. I loved how you can get your own salsa and condiments, because usually other places limit you on condiments and the food doesn't taste the same. I live in Cali and I'm torn that they don't have one near me :("}
{"text":"This place is so good! I have it 4 out of 5 because I have only had one thing here which were the mexican style corn on the cob; that i have only seen in taco trucks! Authentic mexican food here! AND great prices! Nice staff, Always busy. Which is a good sign! Always recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but alas, food could have been great but wasn't.  Had a few tacos and all were cold, particularly the tortillas.  Stuff is made to order so how much trouble is it to prep?  Also, hard to order as staff behind counter had trouble understanding our order (language barrier made it difficult to communicate what we were asking for).  Bathrooms were a mess, with broken soap and towel dispensers and overall appearance was run down.  Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place and frequent it often. I would have gave 5 stars but sometimes some of the workers there are not very friendly or attentive. 
I have tried nachos, fries, tacos and today after seeing it on instagram a vampiro. I have enjoyed everything I have eaten so far and can't wait to try the mula next. They have happy hour starting at 5 and that's great for some $5 margaritas but if you make it here before 5 go for the pitcher of margarita it's a better deal 
It is a fast food restaurant so you stand in line and clean up after yourself. I definitely recommend giving it a try if your in the mood for some tacos"}
{"text":"When I crave tacos I come here. They have the best gran tacos. Two tortillas topped with beans and cheese topped with your choice of meat and guac sour cream and salsa. Like a Mexican flag. Their carne asada fries are some of my favorite I've tried. The fries are crispy and it really makes a difference. They have al pastor which is cooked and cut straight from the spit. Meat spinning cooking device. I actually just looked that up and yes that's what's it's called. Lol. They have another location low on Silverado but I've never been there. This is the oh location and I'll stick to it. Fresh salsa bar with plenty to choose from the staff is always friendly and their horchata is the best hands down. Love me some Taco Y taco."}
{"text":"Having eaten at the other Taco Y taco several times I was pleasantly surprised at the decor and size of this location. It has ample searing including an upstairs area that's a chill dimly light area to hang with friends and grab some drinks. 

Ordering can be kind of
Tricky since there's different lines for different menu items. We came on a Tuesday and had no idea about happy hour. They offer $5 chicken nachos and tacos 3 for $2 carnitas tacos no substitutions. They also have specials on drinks and have a bar area to order drinks and a limited seating area. I love the gran tacos so I ordered one of those nachos to share and tacos for my friend. The nachos are fully loaded and they don't skimp on anything. I've sampled most of the menu items from the other location. Al pastor if you're a fan is very good it's joy a favorite of mine but it is good. Also the tripas are good and the carne Asada fries have to be my favorite in town hands down. What makes them the best is that the fries are super crispy the guacamole is freshly made (not premade) and they actually grill their carne over an open flame giving the meat more flavor. Just make sure you have some horchata with your meals it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"So I decided to go back.  I got the carna taco's this is it!  This is what I like from here.  OMG, this was great.  My husband loves Mexican food, he usually goes to NLV.  I think he's really going to like this place.  He was skeptical about checking it out.  He hates it when he dosn't like something.  
So I decided to bring him here for dinner.  (yes, I went 2 times today, Don't judge me)  So I tried to tell my husband to get the tacos, but he went for the burrito.   I got tacos, and there mexican rice.  That rice.........I love rice, almost any kind of rice if it's good, and that rice was good!   So hubby really liked the burrito, but he said he should have listened to me and got the tacos.  So all was good.  We met the owner on the way out, she was super cool, and hella young!  

Hubby had surgery, and after he wanted tacos from here.  So I go and get tacos!  Now I really like this place, but it's not very to go friendly!  The girl at the register gave me a plastic bag to put pinto beans in it ( ok, just think about that for a min) really, you don't have a container!  Next time I will bring my own to go container.  I had issues with that!  So I guess, if I'm not going to eat there they my loose some business, because they make it to difficult for me to get what I want to go."}
{"text":"Upsetting I didn't get to try anything here. 
Had never been here before, we walked in and were slightly confused by how the lines were suppose to work. We made our way up to what we think was the front and the lady just stared at us. I greeted her and told her it was our first time here, I figured that would be enough of a hint for her to be slightly more patient with us. \"What do you want?\" was all I got, so I just blurted out tacos and she walked away. Wait, do I get to pick what kind of tacos? How many? Hello? I looked at the other worker at the front for help and she just stared at me in a daze. Is everyone here on drugs?
Apparently only to us, right after that another customer walked in, and she snapped out of it and proceeded to take her order, which she completed in full and moved her on down the line to pay for her meal. After continually being ignored for 2 minutes, we made our way to the cashier too, hoping they could give us some insight. Same random blank stare and they mumbled something to us about our food being almost ready. Why was the other customer run through so speedly but no one can figure out where my supposed order went?
Getting anxious from the mass confusion and awkwardness of the staff, I just walked out. Major communication issues here that I've never had at any place I've been new to. On the avoid list."}
{"text":"So apparently, I happen to go during the busiest time around 6:30-7. Minus one star for a disorganized line system.  I knew what I wanted and waited in the \"burrito/nacho/fries\" line right off the bat.  My friends wanted tacos and waited in that line.  It was so busy that I could see how this would be a problem for others who are not used to ordering from the counter this way.

This is what my friends & I ordered:
- Al pastor fries
- Carne asada nachos
- Al pastor tacos
- Carne asada tacos
- Beef burrito
- Chicharron taco
- Corn on the cob (mexican street style)

Everything was a hit and tasted delicious and flavorful.  The only \"miss\" was the chicharron taco.  My friend thought it might be the crispy pork skin version, but ended up to be chewy.  Yuck! We weren't very adventurous, but they do offer a variety of meat options and body parts.  Besides meat, there is of course vegetarian options.  The salad/sauce bar was good, but none of the sauces were labeled.

The new location is very spacious and looks like an upscale taco joint.  The food though, stays true to authenticity. There are also extra seating upstairs.Happy hour daily during 6-8pm ($1 off beer).

Overall, great food & location.  For about $10 you can get a satisfying meal.  Whether it is 3 tacos + drink, or fries + corn."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2/100***

Ok lemme me just say that this place is pretty legit, but coming from Los Angeles it's pretty hard to top King Taco and the likes. I have yet to find a place here that even comes close to the carne asada they have in LA. With that being said, the Al pastor tacos they have are very flavorful often times with pieces that legitimately taste like bacon. And their elotes are ohhhh so good, it takes me back to afternoons in LA when we munch on those suckers after we pick up our son from school. Food is a solid 3 (although one time I mistakenly ordered the chicharon taco thinking it was going to be a crunch fest and all I got was fatty soggy pork skin, I was mortified but the gentleman who helped me put the crunchy chicharon I was expecting on top to make up for it) plus 1 star for the awesome and friendly people that work here. We'll definitely be back as this is the hubby's go to place for tacos now that we've moved back into town."}
{"text":"Visited Taco y taco for the first time today,  living here it's hard to find authentic Mexican food.  It was awesome! Went during my lunch hour wasn't too busy. Had the Corn on the cob and the carne asada tacos... everything was delish. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I tried the al pastor, barbacoa and asada tacos. The flavor of the meats were good but not great. I've had tacos that were half the price and tasted much better. I'm not saying that these tacos are expensive - I was just expecting these tacos to wow me or have a more authentic flavor. 

Their salsa bar is clean and the ingredients are fresh. The staff is also friendly and welcoming. It's a good option for the area if you're craving tacos."}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco: because I'm an equal opportunity carnivore and will happily nom down all parts of the cow, not just the \"normal\" meats.

I may be picky sometimes, but when it comes to meats, I try to be an adventurous eater, particularly when visiting one close friend of mine in Vegas who is like.... Andrew Zimmern status. We had been debating between going to Taco Y Taco or Tacos El Gordo (which I have been to, many years ago) this visit, but Taco Y Taco was the obvious choice when it was decided I needed to try the cabeza tacos.

We arrived around 5:30-6 on a late Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. Lots of reviewers have complained about how confusing and complicated the ordering system is with the three lines, and I do see that when it's busy, but since there were no others in line when we went, it was a breeze. We went to the one line we needed, but while there, the guy making our tacos asked if we wanted anything from either of the other two lines while we were there.

My friend ordered 6 tacos - 3 cabeza (head) and 3 tripas. Get the tripas crispy! It makes it the texture of super light, crispy fried chicken skin! Normally, when found in pho or at Korean bbq, i hate tripe, but my friend had be try a piece and crispy in these tacos, I loved it.

I got 3 tacos for myself - cabeza, suadero (meat from between the cow's belly and leg) and lengua (tongue).

The cabeza was great, but the pieces of meat were shredded so, so tiny, it was hard to get a real meaty flavor amidst the onions and cliantro in the taco. This was the one meat that I added some salsa to, but it complimented it perfectly. SIDEBAR: the salsa bar is huge! I'm a big baby for spicy stuff so I only tried one mild salsa, the chunkiest one on the end closest to the taco lines) and it was really great with the cabeza. I also didn't want to get much salsa since I wanted to really just savor the flavor of the meats I was eating.

I had never had nor tried suadero before walking into Taco Y Taco. I was curious as to what it was, and upon seeing where in the cow it was from, I knew I had to try it. I love fish bellies and pork belly, why wouidn't I like cow belly? It was tender and sweet and flavorful. I could have easily had a few suadero tacos. No salsa necessary.

Lengua, sweet, sweet lengua, meat of my dreams. Beef tongue is one of my favorite meats at any Korean bbq (when it's available) and lengua tacos are probably my favorite street tacos. Lengua is such a smooth, melt in your mouth meat that I just want to feed it to all my friends (without telling them what it is first so that they aren't scared). Next time I'm here I'll get at least 3 of these :)

I can't wait to come back to Taco Y Taco the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Authentic and clean eating. I ordered 3 carne asada & 2 chicken tacos w/corn tortillas for our little family of 3. My son had 1 carne asada and my each had 1 of each.

This place is great for kids because you choose everything you want on it and everything is a-la-cart. I added guacamole and pico de gallo to mine and my sons was dry. 

The meat is REAL! Not from a can or frozen. They have a large salsa station, fountain drink dispenser and Mexican sodas you can purchase. 

Its a little confusing when you come in but here is how it works: 

1. Walk in and walk towards the meat station. Here there are 3 lines, this is where you choose your meal and your meat choice. 

2. Walk to your left and proceed to add anything you want to your order. Add an ear of corn and all the trimmings (like the \"elote man\" from the park in the hood). 

3. Pay 

4. Add your salsa fixings from the salsa station and load up on the limes  

5. Sit anywhere you want. Grab a high chair for the kids while you dispense your soda and fially.. 

6. Enjoy! 

If you need to use the restroom, you can find them on the right of the restaurant. 

NOTE: There is not a changing table in the womans or mens bathroom so make sure you bring something to lay on the floor to change your child or just go out to the car and do it there.

I highly recommend this place for your family to eat out at."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and it was AMAZING! You can taste the freshness of the food and homemade tortillas and chips. I had the barbecoa tacos with a side of chips and pico de gallo. Definately going back for more. The only aspect I didnt like was the ordering process. You stand in different lines to order what you want. You want tacos, you stand in one line. You want a quesadilla, you have to go to a different line to order. All in all, friendly staff, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco offers one of the best of the taco off the strip.

They have a full range of different meats and tortilla combinations from gourmet gut busters to the simple but scrumptious three-bite street tacos. Plus, lots of different salsas to choose from.

My favorite taco's are:
Mulas - Two soft tortillas with melted cheese and the meat and toppings of your choice sandwiched in the middle.
Vampiro - Two crisp tortillas with melted cheese and the meat and toppings of your choice sandwiched in the middle.

Dining experience is cool and unexpected considering this is taco shop. 
They have a decent lounge area setup, you can order drinks and relax.  

It's worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  This was our first time here and we're favorably impressed.  Busy for a Sunday lunch (which was a good thing).  Ordering was different, so if you're confused just ask one of the friendly staff for help.  They will also give you samples if you'd like to try something you haven't had before.  Even the music reminds me of my many trips to Mexico. We'll be back and I'll bring my Nana."}
{"text":"We yelped this place earlier today and so glad I found a legit authentic awesome vibe Mexican place! What can I say, the street tacos are super delicious and just enough spice where you don't even need some salsa. 

My wife is Mexican and yeah, it's up to par with her food haha :D  

You gotta try out the Vampiro with everything on it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty dang good!! All I got to say is elote!  We live in a neighborhood where they do not allow street vendors to come in and sell they way they do in North Town. I grew up there and miss the elote man so much.  Now I have a place to come and buy it!!! Love this!!"}
{"text":"Delicious meat. All of it. Breakfast burrito is great, too. Some seriously excellent Mexican street food, but made comparatively meticulously. If you're on a hunt for a great taco, come here. You won't be disappointed."}

{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     16/100

I RARELY give 1 star reviews. 

I love Mexican food and surprisingly I have never been here till last night. Well........... lucky me, I found out why... 

I was craving Mexican food and my friend suggested this place. She said she liked the tacos here. 

It's an upscale taco joint. 2 floors and large open spaces with lots of tables and a bar. Great for big parties. 

There must have been something in the air here, because as soon as we got in line...someone in front of us was complaining about something and it held up the line about 10 minutes. The way it's set up, there's a taco counter and an everything else counter (elote, burrito, nachos, etc.) There was one guy serving at each counter. And two of them, was helping her for 10 minutes. Three other guys in the back cooking and two at the cash register. They were fully staffed but no organization or management. 

There was already a line of people complaining and asking, \"are you guys in line? is this the line?\" Apparently, they aren't organized. Other places, they could have a line out the door and the service would still be faster than this place. 

I was craving for a burrito, but I wanted to try the Al Pastor tacos. I wanted to see how it compares to other places. I got three with everything on it. About $8.  $2.25 each taco + tax. Pricey for a taco. Most places are a dollar something. 

When I ordered, the guy had an attitude and was obviously pissed with the customer he just dealt with...and I was doing my best to be kind, smile and be understanding... but I got pissed when he just threw the tacos on my tray. It splattered and left a mess. W.T.F. 

And up next, we had to wait in another line just to get an elote (Mexican street style corn on a stick). that took another 10 minutes. Because there was only one guy working that counter... he was on point and had great service, the only one that had great customer service. 

The tacos were Bland, flavorless, lifeless... in the al pastor meat and sauce. And the pineapple doesn't taste like pineapple. The toppings didn't make it any better.

I was disappointed. So very disappointed with the food and service. I should've just went to Roberto's, Cafe Rio, or Fausto's near by. And at $2.25 a taco... it was so not worth the $8. 

Before we left, we asked for a takeout box. 
Turns out they are charging $1 for a takeout box. So my friend ended up getting a foil and a bag. Cashier was rude about it as well. Attitude problem. 

That pissed me off because every other restaurant anywhere... takeout boxes are FREE. 

I will not be back again. The food is pricey, tasteless and service sucks. 

I'd rather drive all the way to the Strip or north side for Tacos El Gordo than eat here again."}
{"text":"Great craft beer menu, one of the better selections I've seen. Great food. Every taco is unique and it's fun to order several different tacos as a meal. Their cocktails are given special attention with homemade mixes and infused sweeteners like Serrano honey. Definitely a \"I want to go back\" kind of place."}
{"text":"The food is awesome so is give that a 5 but the ordering process sort of confusing and intimidating at first :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! You can't go wrong with any of them. I had the Carne Asada and Al Pastor and they were delicious. Their rice and beans are also very good! I was in Vegas a week and ate there twice!!!
Lots of add ins and their sauces are the bomb!
Next time i am in town I'll be heading over for tacos for sure!"}
{"text":"Favorite Place in Vegas for tacos!! My goodness the best Chicharron tacos ever!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.

So yum!! First of all, the food is DELICIOUS! And its reasonably priced! I've had tacos and al pastor fries (the small size is HUGE) and was so happy with both.

Place is large and brightly lit, workers are friendly and salsa bar is great!! SO many salsas to choose from and a good selection of spicy ones!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed that they were not doing take out anymore, however, we came in today and i was extremely impressed with their food AND customer service. They really made the ordering process super easy."}
{"text":"It felt kind of too upscale for what the food is. It was like an upscale Tacos el gordo where I feel like my car wont get broken into but the food is just....close but no cigar. I'll come here for the corn... and when I need a taco fix and dont feel like driving downtown.... but nothing compares to the awesomeness that is the adobada at Tacos el Gordo."}
{"text":"Still in search for the best Al Pastor in town!

Taco Taco fairs well but average IMO! The al pastor was good, but not above the rest. They were completely out of Lengua and Chorizo, so I wasn't able to try them! The Asada was also average in my opinion.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-taco-mexican-eatery-las-vegas?select=GHocOcTO-lY_e310BQcHFA#GHocOcTO-lY_e310BQcHFA

I usually don't order Tripas, but I decided to break from the norm and give it a go since they were out of most everything else. It was crispy, flavorful, and good!

I really like their salsa bar here...8 different salsas, beans, veggies, etc! Way more expansive than any other I have ran into so far, and it keeps it fun and interesting!  It was a little odd adding salsa to tacos that already had salsa though, so this is more for people that ask for plain?  Probably for burrito orders and misc too.

But since I am still searching for the best, I have to move on to the next!  Who else do I have to try??  Message me!"}
{"text":"I just came across this place by chance and it turned out to be one of my favorite Taqueria's I've ever been to the food quality the ambience the entertainment I am so happy"}
{"text":"This is def as good as it gets in Vegas... Came here for the first time with my bff last night and we loved it! Great food, good service, cool and clean atmosphere! I am in love with the Al Pastor tacos. Also tried their horchata, Barbacoa taco and elote... Everything was indeed yummy. Got some to go for my husband: lengua, asada, barbacoa and al pastor tacos and he was feeling em too! Interested in trying out their burritos next time. This is seriously our new spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this gold mine while visiting my brother. The food is fantastic. It's fresh, delicious and authentic Mexican food. There is an amazing salsa bar inside and a full bar. I wish this place was in California. I look for to coming back. Also, the staff was kind, courteous and very welcoming. I felt like part of the family."}
{"text":"If I had a choice, I'd go to Taco y Taco over Tacos el Gordo. The Al Pastor is MUCH better and less greasy. The decor is obviously lightyears ahead of any Tacos el Gordo locations, but I suppose that's part of it's charm... Never the less, I'd prefer to sit in a comfy, padded booth with my 5 year old vs the hard plastic ones in el Gordo.

They also do burrito bowls and the fries are never soggy here. Salsa bar is a given and a must try."}
{"text":"Food was alright, but the ordering process was so confusing I wouldn't go back. The Mexican corn was really good. There was almost no description of any of of the food, so you just have to know what you like. For instance, there are 6 different types of beef, but no descriptions about how they're different. Guacamole is bland, had to add a bit bunch of lime and salt to it. My husband really enjoyed his al pastor taco and carne asada vampira. A small but interesting selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"A mess....unorganized no line control...sad, made it to line 1, two tacos on our tray...and left cause we could not take the unnecessary chaos just to procure a quick lunch"}
{"text":"I personally love this place but I think more for the decor than the actual food. and it is part of the reason why I'm being nice for the review so really 3.4/5 stars. you come in and you feel like oh this is definitely not Robertos! lol btw

we loved the whole different lines they had it was a cool cafeteria concept. we ended up going with

al pastor tacos (3.5/5)- watching them slice the meat in your taco gave it a special homemade feel to it. as far as the meat itself loved the texture, it was juicy but it had either too much cinnamon or something but maybe that's authentic for them I dunno.

chicharon tacos (4/5)-these were my personal fave because it was sliced pork belly and they put the crispy chicharons on to to give it that texture and obvious with the garnishes it made this so good!

street corn (2/5) I'm sorry but the version they have brought here does not taste anything like the lady pushing the cart in your neighborhood. it had too much cheese and the flavors were not authentic.I think they need some work in this particular dish.

If you ask me if I might come back to this place but then again I probably would come with a lot more people I think this place had charm because the space can accommodate a lot of people. I could see eating here after a night of drinking and just taking with your friends and hanging out while enjoying some cheap tacos! oh btw I love the salsa bar...so many different kinds can't wait to try some more."}
{"text":"The picture comparing the burrito to an arm is a lie! My burrito wasn't half the size of my girlfriends arm! :(

Anyways... below mediocre burrito but their taco's are comparable to taco el gordo.

The place is located on tropicana & pecos in a pretty big plaza. The interior of the place is super clean and spacious. Along with a well stocked sauce bar.

Walking in I was a bit confused on where to order but soon realized it was laid out like tacos el gordo. Order what you want at a specific window. And the ordering process for a burrito is similar to that of chipotle. Have an empty tortilla and fill it up with your own personal preferences. 

In the end I ordered the asada burrito & pork taco. Burrito was pretty lack luster since I couldn't even taste any of what I was eating. Taco on the other hand was suppppppperrrr juicy. UNFFFF. 

Pro tip: You can get free elote if you vote for them on best of vegas :o"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff (their English isn't always the best, but don't let that deter you).  We usually get the tacos, but the burritos are amazing, too!  Try their carnitas or barbacoa.  If you're wanting to try something new, they have cow tongue and pig snout as well, which is actually surprisingly good (may not be everyone's cup of tea though)."}
{"text":"Ate there twice this week for the first time. Excellent.  We had different tacos both night. All quite good. And at $2.25 per taco, it was a cheap dinner. 

The chips and guacamole portion was generous. Guacamole was a bit watery the second night but ok. 

The street corn was very tasty. 

We'll be back soon to try more."}
{"text":"It's soooo good. These tacos are the best in my opinion! Definitely recommend- I like this location better because it's cleaner though."}
{"text":"I've always heard of this place on the radio so I was looking forward to coming. When you walk in its not very inviting. When trying to order no one acknowledges you. When you finally have someone helping you, you have to repeat your order about three times. The place on where they cook and cut the meat is disgustingly dirty. I ask for my tacos with cilantro and onion. I get my tacos with just onion because they didn't want to cut up fresh cilantro. Overall very disappointed with the service and food. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp we decided to try this place. It's super cute with nice decor. They had a live Dj playing while enjoying our tacos. I tried the cabeza taco & the chicharrón con salsa verde. The chicharrón taco was my favorite. Super tasty. The adobada tacos were pretty good too. I'm only giving them 4 stars because we are from San Diego & tacos do not compare to our Tj tacos but they were tasty. You walk up and order from different stations similar to Tacos El Gordo in SD. Give this place a try if your in the neighborhood. Staff is friendly. My advice would be to order fast because the tacos get cold quick."}
{"text":"Vegetarian/Vegan options a huge plus! One of the better authentic quick serve Mexican places in E Vegas that has veg options. I love me some authentic Mexican, not that crappy Vegas touristy crap that is along the strip and in that area. 

I got a burrito. You can choose from black or pinto beans, Mexican or cilantro rice. You can add in guacamole, peppers, onions, lettuce and your salsa options. I also got a plain elotes on the side. The salsa bar offers a variety and all taste flavorful ranging from mild to hot. I do think they could up the heat a bit for their hot salsas and their green tomatillo. 

The only ding I have to give them is their burrito tortillas are grocery store bought (like Old Mission) and taste just that; factory made. I didn't like it, tasted off to me. I would rather have had a fresher or homemade tortilla. Only non authentic thing. I would eat here again and try the tacos."}
{"text":"Really great spot, especially for al pastor tacos. Freshly carved off the spit, the meat has so much flavor - goes excellent with everything on their tacos - cilantro, avocado cream and pineapple. Street Corn also delicious, solid guacamole and salsa options are decent. The place could use a bit of a clean up however, multiple times I go in there and there aren't too many clean tables and the garbages are overflowing. However, some of the best tacos around here in my opinion. 4.25/5"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum  & YUM! Ordering is quite neat. Setup is similar to a cafeteria although you stand in a particular line to order certain items on the menu. I ordered carne Assad's fries and man were they out of this world! Delicious and possibly the best I tasted in this city.

Drink selections are widespread. There's bottled drinks, alcohol, and tap drinks. I got a tap drink, because I wanted unlimited refills. Everything is self serve. Get your own food. Make your own sauces.  Refill your own drinks.

No WiFi I could. It's located near a lot of businesses and you don't have to venture too far from the highway to get there. Good location.

Decor felt original and vibrant. Good feels and lots of positive energy. I had a blast! My experience was a good one."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant today, even though I live down the street.  Great tacos, clean restaurant, DJ spinning great music on a Friday night and Eddie the bartender was awesome.  Very friendly and knowledge in all of their tequila!  HH is from 5-7pm daily and I'll make sure to back. Def recommend."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on the strength of other yelpers and it was close to home!!  We were very pleasantly surprised upon entering from the back that it is a large and very clean restaurant.  We went up to the front and told Juan that this was our first time and he instantly began explaining the process and getting some samples ready for us to try.  We got some al pastor, carnitas and steak samples.  I went with the al pastor tacos and the bf got a tripas burrito.  He can be very picky about food and loved the monster burrito they made.  Service was fast, the food so fresh and so many choices available that I can't wait to go here again.  The prices are very reasonable and we were more than satisfied with the experience.  They have a large selection of meats and vegetarian choices.  This will be my go to place for tacos from now on!!"}
{"text":"Add this to your taco list immediately! If you don't have a taco list, start one immediately, and put Taco Taco on it twice. What I love most about this double the name, double the delicious eatery, is that based on my limited knowledge, it appears to be authentic but is easy enough for a gal like I myself to navigate without feeling completely clueless. Big signs help. 

There are different stations for different meats. Just saunter up and let the cook know how many you'd like of your preferred meat. They'll whip them up fresh, plate them hot and push them over the counter to you. They have a large selection of meats, including lengua. They even have vegetarian chorizo, aka soyrizo. The tortillas are made fresh in house, and each meat comes with a different selection of toppings and salsa. If you want to avoid carbs, they do bowls as well, and if you want a bigger bite, burritos are available. The variety is incredible. 

I am a sucker for pastor with pineapple, so as soon as I saw that beauty spinning with a hunk of pineapple on top, I said, \"Give me two!\" Unfortunately, I thought it was too salty, and thereby violated a sacred taco shop rule: On the first visit, just order one of each so you can decide which one you really like. Here, it was the carnitas that I should have doubled up on! I should have known when I saw the simmering pot of juicy pork bits. 

Every taco is super generous with the meat. It's definitely a $2.00 pile of goodness. The service is super friendly. The place is big and clean. 

I may or may not make a special trip over to the east side just for these tacos, but if I am in the hood, it will definitely be my go-to!"}
{"text":"UGH TODAY WAS MY FIRST TIME TRYING IT , the best tacos at a low price , corn is BOMB. Horchata is just right and was in and out fast."}
{"text":"Confusing set-up for ordering and paying. Love the food and portions."}
{"text":"The convenient part of Taco Y Taco is that they're open late night especially around the location that it is in where there are barely eating spots available. So it's nice to not travel as far as the strip or China town to get food. There are 4 stations for different items but during late nights there's only one person running the three Taco stations. The 4th station, next to the register is where you'd let the person know you'd want things like a burrito or carne asada fries for example. Then you'd pay at the register and sit and wait for your food to come out once it's ready. I got four tacos, a breakfast burrito, and carne asada fries for $25.09 w/ tax. We waited about ten minutes for our carne asada fries and breakfast burrito. While we waited we packed some sauces from their condiment bar where you could pack limes, mild sauce, habanero sauce, etc. Customer service was great, I really liked how patient the cashier was with us with it being our first time but the only issue was the guy at the 4th station was cleaning AND serving food with the same gloves on. You could see him taking a cleaning rag and wiping down spilt food, taking dirty dishes back and forth to the dishwashing station, and then coming back to his station rolling up a burrito with the same gloves, no changing it or washing it. So I'm not sure if I ever want to come back just because of that, they were slow anyways so he had the opportunity to wash his hands and change his gloves after cleaning. Aside from that the food was awesome! It's a bittersweet feeling for me, I love the taste of their food but thinking of how it's prepared with the same cleaning gloves worries me. Two stars for the cashier's customer service and their food."}
{"text":"Edit. I came back after several months and the cuisine is yummy.  Try their vampiro is really yummy. Check the Smith's receipt for a complimentary chip order with order."}
{"text":"Drove from LA and got an Airbnb about a mile from this place. I yelped the nearest tacos and found that this place had some great reviews. So there we go, and I got some tacos de asada and the meat wasn't even cut finely. There were some big chunks that were chewy that bothered me while I was eating them. My mom ordered the chicken tacos and they never mentioned how spicy the meat was. My mom was only able to have one taco and couldn't finish the rest. My husband had his favorite type of meat, tacos al pastor, and he got excited cuz they added real pineapples but he said the taste wasn't there and didn't enjoy them. We also got aguas de horchata and Jamaica and they had no flavor... they tasted watered down, like no sugar. The cashier lady was sweet but the food wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere,  great food,  great drinks!  The staff is amazing,  friendly and knowledgeable.  I love the carne asada bowls and the street corn."}
{"text":"If your going to eat Taco y Taco, make sure u go to Eastern location. This Tropicana/Pecos is disgusting. Bathrooms are horribly maintained and our food tastes like the meat has just been sitting for hours. Not clean, owners should pay attention and maintain BOTH locations and not just one. NEVER coming to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I have at here a few times before. It's a Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. But, I do know this place does get busy.  While there is no direction on where a line starts (can lead to confusion), I believe part of the experience is like ordering street tacos. You walk up an order what you want. I know it's a little unconventional, but I hope this review helps a person who may not be aware. 

You do have a nice selection of meats. I tend to order a chicken bowl and sometimes a taco. The food is delicious. In the middle, they have salsas, radishes, limes and other toppings. 

I do like the interior. It's got a vintage-like feel to it, high ceilings, and upstairs, and very open seating. This place looks like good cater for an event. It's got the space for it. If you don't feel like staying to eat in, no biggie. Just order what you want and you can take it to go.

By the way, the street corn is delicious."}
{"text":"Finally, I had time to stop by the new location!
I LOVE the original Taco y Taco on Trop and Pecos.  I knew I'd love it here, and let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed!

I haven't been to this building since it was Fado's, about 5 years ago.  
I absolutely love what they've done with the space!!  

The main room is very open, with plenty of space, which is good.  This place was PACKED at lunch time!  I even ran into Shirley B!

The setup is the same as the old spot:  different stations for what kind of tacos/meats that you want.  
This time, I had an al pastor (duh), a chorizo taco, and a chorizo mulas.  My friend and I also tried tripas for the first time, which was surprisingly good. :)

Same quality food, more space, and it feels more like a modern bar/eatery than a cantina.  I really like it.  My only sad point is that its a bit far for me to drive.  Luckily, I have the original spot whenever I'm not in Henderson. 

Great job, Taco y Taco crew!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Taco y Taco.  

Of course, we've been back in several times over the 2 1/5 years since my last review, its just taken some time for me to remember to update.

My most recent visit was last night, for the 3 year anniversary, where all tacos (except seafood) were $1.  

It was so busy...busier than I'd ever seen the place, but everyone remained super friendly, and helpful.  

Last night, I had 3 vegetarian tacos: the Seta (mushrooms), Soyrizo, and Fajita tacos.  
They were all delicious, but the soyrizo was my favorite. Mildly spicy, and a lot of \"meat.\"  
The girl who made my tacos was very nice, and made sure that I didn't have any avocado near my plate. (I'm allergic.)

A few times ago, I tried the sesos tacos, which are beef brains.  
If you're adventurous, try it!  Its actually really delicious.  

I love everything I've ever eaten here, and it remains a favorite place."}
{"text":"Came here because the rating was 4+ and it did not disappoint. Delicious tacos (tried the al pastor) and friendly staff. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"WOW great tacos we had Lengua, al Pastor and Carnitas all very good and the street corn was delicious, Staff was very nice and service was very good. Give them a try we will be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"Omg.

This is my spot since moving to CA. I love tacos, as being from LA, we love our tacos. I was devastated when I learned I would be moving to Las Vegas and leaving good Mexican food behind. 

Fast forward to trying out this place- it's far from where I stay, but I'll live. I love every single meat option (have had them all in a taco form each time I come) and have never been disappointed. I just recently ventured on the unbeaten path and had a burrito and bowl from here. The burrito is amazing as well- and the bowl is an adjustment from chipotles size and flavor.  But I'm not complaining. 

I also want to recommend the margaritas with a sugar rim; they are delicious and strong, but sweet, so the buzz sneaks up on you (just the way I like it!). 

Go there now!"}
{"text":"They have like  9+ salsas or sauces (all amazing) and EVERY type of meat  you would find at a great street taco stand. Pastor, saudero, asada, pollo, cabeza, cesos,lengua, carnitas, buche, chicharron, chorizo etc.  They do corn two ways, but elote mexicano with  Mayo, parmesan  and Chile  is the best.

 It is like if a taco stand  and chipotle had a child. BEST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE HAD IN PAST  15 YEARS. I grew up in Hatch NM and So CA so I know good mexican food and this is IT !

Vampiro Taco was great, no salsa so it traveled well on a to-go order, some pastor tacos, chicken nachos and an elote mexicano estilo. Great Dinner!"}
{"text":"I usually drive down to the restaurant, but today I was being lazy and ordered through postmates. I called the restaurant to verify that the sauce I wanted would be with my order and Catherine who answered the phone was extremely rude, stating they do not work with post mates and have no business with them, I again stated I only wanted to make sure the sauce would be with order, and she was quite rude, her attitude has steered me away from not only never ordering to go again, but stepping a foot in the restaurant again. By the way, you do actually have something to do with postmates because my money went to you for the order, hence you doing business with post mates and as well the person who orders the food, Catherine."}
{"text":"Al Pastor was my favorite! This was my first time. I'll definitely come back. It's like a Chipotle meets Roberto's. Nice atmosphere and good service. Price was pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Don't have the words to express how disappointing this first and last visit was for me.

Most of the food we ordered was very light on meat.
The pastor burrito was small compared to other restaurants and had a cloves after taste, carnitas also tasteless, very unusual as was the rest of the food. The pics on here are deceiving. 
The flavors were mild to tasteless, not a typical taco stand. I think this place caters to the UNLV crowd, enough said.
Not a good value for the money.
Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"One word. VAMPIRO.

Every since my sister introduced me to Taco Y Taco, I make it my mission to go get their vampiro every time I'm in Vegas. Forget the tacos, burritos, fries, and everything else- do yourself a favor and get their carnitas vampiro!

It is to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The salsa is the best I've had in Vegas and only bested by a few ever.  Great vegetarian menu including soy riso and the prices are super affordable.  This place is now part of my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Good food but the order and menu line was so confusing for your first time. Cooks in the back will yell for your order as you walk up to the counter. Please organize your kitchen and cashier. While I was there I overheard others saying how confusing it was as well. Food is also way overpriced to what seemed like street style Mexican food. Then again it seemed like a place for hipsters."}
{"text":"Food was good . Confusing ordering system if you are a first timer. Nachos are average. Would prefer nacho daddy's nachos   Good atmosphere    Serve beer"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! Definitely recommend this place for authentic Mexican food and great customer service."}
{"text":"The ordering process was a little intimidating initially but after I got past line 1 I got the hang of it. I like all of the different meat and options available. I had a very tasty beef lengua taco, chicken taco and beef mulas. 
The atmosphere was cozy and I enjoyed the music played over the speaker. It wasn't so loud that I couldn't hear our party talking. 
I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place, Awesome Bartenders, And Food is delicious!

-1 star rating: Unorganized ordering service, patio seating is boring, and no combo menus"}
{"text":"So, I love Tacos El Gordo (doesn't everyone?!), and I decided to try their partner in crime. I learned that both places have the same owner so I figured Taco Y Taco would be just as tasty. And it was!!!

This place has a few more meat choices than Tacos El Gordo. If you want asada, you must go here since Tacos El Gordo doesn't offer asada. For you gringos and non speaky Spanish people, asada = beef. There are also few other options like asada fries, but be forewarned that they no longer have mole' fries"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Tripas, Pibil, Carne Asada Tacos
Al Pastor Vampiro

Now with two local locations, the first on East Tropicana with a larger and more upscale space in Henderson on South Eastern, Taco Y Taco is said by many to offer some of the best Mexican street food in all of Las Vegas, a Saturday lunch showing the original to offer a fairly good bargain as well.

Located in one of streets various retail centers, an elevated space with backdoor and dining room accessed by the parking lot while the counter at which one orders is best approached by foot from the street, Taco Y Taco is not the sort of place to splurge on décor or creature comforts, the focus squarely on the food and matter-of-fact customer service, an argument taking place on arrival as customer argued with the cook about why he could not add eggs to an item.

Featuring various \"Lines,\" though none really seemed to matter too much provided the order was straightforward and ready to go, it was with Chicharrons not yet available that a three Taco late, plus one \"Vampiro\" was assembled - the affirmative answer to \"with everything?\" adding cilantro, onions and housemade salsa with additional options for customization available at a tiny salsa bar.

Playing traditional music loudly overhead, soccer on the TV with the view out the windows facing a Plasma Donation Center, a look at the food shows a lot of time spent in preparing various meats from which the Pibil was tender, though slightly underflavored while the Carne Asada featured a robust bit of char to the tender beef with a slightly spicy linger.

Serving Beef Tripe from a small steamer basket, but happy to toss it back on the griddle when requested crispy, the Taco Tripa was undeniably unctuous with a good mix of crunch and creaminess playing well off the toppings while the crispy Tortilla griddled around melted Cheese and Pork Al Pastor was every bit deserving of the praise heaped upon it - the marinated meat almost sweet in beneath the exterior layer of caramelization and good enough that a second trip to the counter was justified for one more.

THREEE AND A HALF STARS:  Certainly no expert on Tacos or Street Food, but knowledgeable enough to know well made food and a deal, Taco Y Taco is a worthwhile stop for their signatures, though the under-seasoned Pibil and lack of a menu item at 11:00 show room for improvement."}
{"text":"For Vegas standards, Taco y Taco is very authentic. I've been there for lunch twice and it's never crowded. Pork is not my thing, but their steak and chicken tacos are both seasoned to perfection. On Taco Tuesday, they offer a happy hour in the afternoon with tacos for only a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I've been to the one in Henderson and this place looks like the ugly stepchild that no one likes. I come in and automatically get stared down by two lazy women sitting on the tall chairs gossiping like always. Then I proceeded to go order the people there take forever for 2 tacos and while waiting it got cold. I go to ask for guacamole and chips and the idiot making my boyfriends fries was busy talking to some guy and not once did she stop talking to him. Absolutely unacceptable. This ghetto place puts the one in green valley to shame everything from the decor to the customer service and food. Never will I give me money to this place again worst $33 dollars spent and I'm in this place as I type that's how bad the service is I had to write it instantly. Terrible"}
{"text":"Good stuff! We tried this for lunch one day, then went back for dinner. It's big and clean. Order at the counter, pay the cashier and seat yourself. Employees are friendly. Great fish tacos, great carne asada tacos, yummy elote. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"I was a little thrown off when I walked in and saw this place had a line to order at the counter and then take your food to your table, but you know it's really good food.  Every staff member I came in contact with was happy, helpful and seemed to enjoy their job.  Here's a good tip: sit at the bar and you can order there without standing in lines.  See if Omar is working - he's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos at around $2 apiece, friendly staff, and a pretty impressive rotating beer selection for a taco joint! Everyone in here is always very nice. The only complaint might be that they're a bit of a one trick pony without much variety to their menu, but they're good at what they do and always pretty busy, so don't mess up a good thing, right? Open till 2am on the weekends which might save you from making a mistake at a place like Roberto's. Fill your drunk belly up with some tacos and maybe one more beer instead. Tacos al pastor with all the fixings (which includes pineapple) that's where it's at! Yum!"}
{"text":"Simple. Food is great and....they have a great selection of craft beer. What finally got me in the door was a friend said they had a beer from a company called Evel Twin on tap- name of the beer itself is --Today is Yesterday's Tomorrow---in a style called New England IPA....food and beer stunning...and thanks for throwing a little love to the beer geeks in town..."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Traditional meat options.  The ordering can be a little confusing upon coming in. Different windows for different items. There's alcohol served. Lots of seating plus upstairs seating! The street style corn is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The food is wonderful! They have many options to choose from. There were a couple of vegan options- i ordered the burrito bowl! The drinks are great; They even have alcoholic beverages!  available. *hint* *hint* And the pricing is very reasonable.

I have two main criticisms: 

The lines are very unorganized. I stood in, what looked like to be the vegan line, only to find out I was in the wrong line. So I stood in the other \"line\" for about 10 minutes until I was served my food. The other line was more of a cluster of people, and it had no particular order. By the time my food was ready, the rest of my party had already been waiting for 20 minutes. I would recommend labeling each line very clearly. 

The other criticism is the cleanliness. When I visited, I had to track down a table and wipe it down before eating. I understand Taco Y Taco gets busy, but please make time to clean up between rushes.

Other than that I had a wonderful experience! The food was tasty and filling. The atmosphere is very fun and busy! The bathrooms are well-stocked and clean. I will be back soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian so my options are limited when I want tacos. This place has a \"soyrizo\" taco/burrito that is made out of tofu but tastes just like churizo. It's amazing. I loooooove this place."}
{"text":"Clean facilities. Great taste. Fun atmosphere. 

I'm a taco person. My favorites include the carne asada, al pastor, and cabeza. Chips and (street style) corn on the cob are my side preferences. 

Each item is relatively low in price, but can add up quickly. Fortunately, to me, the cost is worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'm a taco fanatic. I've been on Burrito/Taco Quest for the dankest Grindz in Vegas for a long, long time. I've read review after review and had this place bookmarked for quite some time. 

I found myself on the East side recently and stopped into this taqueria. Once I walked in I was shocked at how large and clean this place is. Usually taco shops in Vegas are dimly lot and kind of dirty. 

There are several different stations, all with different kinds of meats. TyT offered burritos, tacos, nachos, bowls, fries, and Mexican corn. The menu is much more limited than most taco shops around town, but I don't mind. Why do 50 things okay when you can do everything on the menu superbly? 

The Mexican street corn is a must! Fresh corn on the cob, lightly brushed with mayo, coated with cheese, and some spices. (It is not hot, just seasoning perfection!)

Next I ordered an al pastor taco and a lengua taco. Both were melt in your mouth goodness. The meat was perfectly seasoned and succulent. Tender and juicy. Topped with opinions and cilantro. 

Another stand out is the salsa bar. There are 8 salsas. All of which are tasty and fresh. Usually when I am at a Roberto's or the like, the salsa is just gross. Either red and fiery or green and watery and flavorless. There is a green creamy salsa here that is off the charts. No only are there the premium salsas, there are black beans and pinto beans, cucumbers, limes, the spicy carrots and onions, and grilled jalapeños and onions.

My sister and I dined here for under $12 combined. This place is cheap! Too cheap in my opinion, but I can't complain.

Taco y Taco houses the best tacos I've had in Vegas to date. It's totally worth the trip across town for me. I can't wait to go back and introduce more people to this street flair."}
{"text":"LOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE.
I fell in love with Taco el Gordo, but it is so far from where I live. This place is much closer from where I live! And it's basically the same!!! I love their condiment stand. I saw like 8 different salsas and sauces. Their limes were fresh. I'll definitely be comin back to this place more often!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos!  

First off this place is 2 stories and has a house dj.  So great armosphere. Clean and modern inside.

Tacos are so delish! Faves are the al pastor and carnitas.  Mexican corn was so sweet and salty and creamy.  

It's a little confusing when u enter because they are different lines for each item or meat.  Which I don't like bc we ordered the al pastor then got in line for corn and by the time we sat down it was a little cold.  I wish they had a wait staff to take your order lol.

But on the plus side they have a full bar!  Blue moon por favor."}
{"text":"Nice size restaurant with plenty of seating. Full bar and delicious food options. Very quick and friendly service. Ask the bartender to make you a white russian with horchata!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco stops around but they can improve with how messy they make the food. Impossible to eat with your hands. All around good otherwise."}
{"text":"We went to taco y taco based on Yelp reviews and thought it was good.  Worth the trip over but maybe wouldn't make an out of the way trip again.  Staff was very friendly and they assisted during the ordering process.  I had chicken and shrimp;  chicken was really good.  Shrimp was bland.  Salsa bar had 8 to choose from. 

Overall pretty solid."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos and burritos! For  meat eater or vegetarians."}
{"text":"I think this one ends up getting between a 3 and a 4 star (if only I could do half-stars here) from me, and here's why...

Pros: the food is delicious!  And with plenty of options (I'm vegetarian), there's a lot of tasty options to choose from.  They'll also let you sample something if you've never tried it.  I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.

Cons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).

All that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.  If you're visiting Vegas, don't go to Taco Bell.  Please don't go to Taco Bell.  Go to Taco Y Taco, instead."}
{"text":"If daily taco consumption did not lead to obesity, you would find me here every single day of the week. Honesty, I have never had an unsatisfying meal here after a few years of coming here. 

Location - This is located conveniently on Eastern, South of the 215. It's in the most poppin' food plaza in Henderson (in my opinion) next to Sushi Hiro, Smash Burger, and Cafe Zupas. There's plenty of parking AND seating. The restaurant is two stories and even on National Taco Day, there were open seats. 

Food - THERE ARE SO MANY TYPES OF FOODS HERE. If your heart desires quesadilla, they have it. Mexican corn? Got it. So many choices of meat and toppings and they even have alcoholic beverages! I usually opt for the Chicken Quesadilla w/ guacamole and sour cream or three chicken tacos. If I'm feeling extra \"yolo\", I order the chicken fries (which are like nachos but with french fries instead of tortilla chips). All of the meat are chopped as you order it and the items are made freshly right in front of you. There's also a complimentary bar with salsa and toppings. 

Service - As hectic as it gets, everyone tries their best to accommodate to everyone while remaining friendly. It's kind of a weird system where you get into different lines to order certain food items, but it's efficient (when other customers aren't scattered and cutting). 

I would highly, highly recommend coming here to fulfill your Mexican food needs. I always leave with a happy tummy!"}
{"text":"Location is really great, and the place itself is gorgeous. 
The food does not waiver and the flavors are great. Its really hard to find a place with authentic menu items and familiar flavors. This place rocks."}
{"text":"These tacos are toooooooooooo bomb!!!! I don't know what it is about the tacos but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the tacos! No matter what meat I put in that shell it is still good!!! The nachos are not really all that, haven't tried the burritos yet but that is next on my list..

CONS-

2.25 for a street taco is really expensive in my eyes (but they are so damn good!! :)

If your eating there bring your own fan because I was sweating more then a 2 dollar hooker in church within the first 5 minutes of me sitting down!! So hot!!! 

That's all the cons for me!!! Love the tacos!"}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the ordering system, 4 lines for different meats, be patient! Think of it like you're in lines at a cafeteria with the best tacos of your life.  Seriously...just hang out, try not to get mad at people cutting you, the tacos are worth it!! Complimentary salsa bar, sometimes with beans. Lengua and chicharon were great today."}
{"text":"I love this place, tacos,nachos , elote. All amazing my fav is the carne Assada fries!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  We popped in on Friday night after one of my clients couldn't stop raving about this place. It was my very, very picky three year old, almost two year old, my husband and myself. We walked in and immediately my kids starting dancing! The music and atmosphere was so fun and inviting. We made our way over to the counters and they could tell we were lost. An employee came out to the front where we were standing and walked us through the different areas and how we ordered food. 

My kiddos BOTH ate the burritos which was a big victory for us since my three year old is so darn picky. Our food was also delicious. The kids had a great time dancing around and eating their supper which made for a successful dinner out in public (parents, you feel me!). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I USED to love Taco Y Taco when they first established, but every time I keep coming, the quality and atmosphere gets worse and worse. :(

I thought I would get used to the ordering process, but it's not organized at all and it frustrates me. It gets confusing when there's a long line for line 1, and you want to order from line 3, but you don't want to cut anybody and make them (h)angry.

Particularly this past Friday night June 12th, 2015, it was hot and smelly inside. The AC wasn't on, and it reeked of garbage and wet dog in the area next to the staircase. It was seriously uncomfortable eating inside, and I regret choosing not to just eat at home.

I ate 2 al pastor tacos (which I usually get) and the al pastor was not juicy like I had remembered. It was overcooked and not flavorful. It's just difficult because I used to be obsessed with their al pastor, and that night I was utterly disappointed (I take my food seriously, especially when I come to LOVE it haha).

Maybe I just came at a bad night. I give them 2 stars instead of 1 because I remember how they used to be. I'm sad that I was actually disappointed with my experience that night."}
{"text":"Went to Taco Y Taco and had the most amazing bar experience. I feel like I learned so much about certain craft beers, and mezcal. It rivaled my favorite bar Oak & Ivy. I will be back to try their interesting beers, to go along with my fantastic tacos."}
{"text":"First time here. Saw this place of Instagram so had to check it out. It was delicious! It's like an indoor food truck - my personal opinion. The only thing that was confusing was how to order. Different sections for things you want. But other than that, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Honestly? I didn't care for this place. I get they're trying to be authentic to mexican style of ordering tacos, but we're in America, and it's confusing. 

I speak spanish and I asked for salsa, dude looked at me like I was an alien, they don't speak English so I don't know what was hard to understand.

Prices are too high, flies, meh service, confusing setup. Needless to say we haven't been back."}
{"text":"This was a trendy looking place with a full bar.  You order, get your food an then pay.  The vampiro was my favorite it was a crisp tortilla with the meat inside almost like the tostada without cheese.  
The al pastor was so yummy yum yum, the carnitas you can still see it in the oil when they take it our.  They have all kinds if meat and seafood too.  The salsa bar is impressive if you like all the condiments.  It was super clean and easy to get to.  The ordering process is kind of confusing they have lines to order but not sure why.  
The green salsa they have behind the counter is super hot compared to the tomatillo sauce at the salsa bar.  
I ordered the carnitas and al pastor.  They aren't skimpy with meat.  I liked this place and have it a five even though I usually would give it a 4 because it is pricy for 4.00 but the one can be made into two if you want."}
{"text":"It's just ehhh. For street tacos the meat should really shine. Don't expect to be noticed or spoken to first if you don't know Spanish. The staff just looks right through you. They will smile and laugh with each other, but treat you like you are bothersome. 

The atmosphere is cool, much like a Tex-mex style restaurant you would find in Texas. Clean place and the tv's are a nice touch. Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Great fast Mexican food in a great upscale atmosphere close to home!! Great service!! Great people!!"}
{"text":"Some may say that this location is no match for the original. I could agree in some sense. You definitely cannot beat the beer prices over at the original. Yet the new location does have some attributes that are more favorable than the original. One; They have beers on draft. Two; They have liquor. Three: Lines are quick. 

My list is going to make it seem like I'm an alcoholic. That is only half true. The real reason why I go to Taco Y Taco is for their food. The al pastor is one of my favorites. They have that charred crisp on the outside that stands up to the slathering of everything. Ask for the grilled pineapple, too. It just makes the meal better. I have tried almost every single taco and I cannot see anything to complain about. The lengua, cabeza, and carnitas are all delicious. If they do not put on everything that you wanted, do not fret, their salsa bar is unreal, too. I'm used to the cold bar being filled with a few varying degrees of spice, radishes, limes, and the pickled veggies. Theirs has a hot section as well. Grilled onions and jalapenos just taste better when they are kept warm for you.

Although I do not mind to drive to the old location. I can rest at ease knowing that this location is a viable solution to my taco needs."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is so good and usually fresh off the grill which is what makes it so good. It does get super busy and the lines get confusing but it's worth the craziness. We usually get chicken or asada tacos and it comes with cilantro/onion, guacamole, and pico. The pico is a little spicy but still good. We also get the asada nachos with everything on them. They have a little salsa bar And the green sauce is very good. This place also has some the best horchata I've had from a \"fast food\" place. The tacos are $2.50 a taco and the nachos are like $8-9. Its averages out to about the same price of Roberto's but for more and better tasting food. I highly recommend trying this place it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's been forever since I was at a Taco y Taco. I have never been to this location. Looking for something to eat, I noticed they had an outside patio,  (we had our dog with us) so that settled things.
I ordered steak nachos and Doug got Al Pastor tacos. He was happy, I wasn't...my nachos were so bland, even with some of their salsa added, it didn't help. Luckily the dog doesn't mind bland.
Our other problem was with the outside patio, there were 2 doors on the patio but we couldn't use them to get into the restaurant, so every time we needed something we had to go around to the front door. All of the tables were dirty. 
My husband said he didn't like the ordering system, where you have to get in a different line for something. I agree, someone is gonna have cold food.
I am not planning on returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Street-style tacos in an incongruously upscale location. Great, friendly, attentive staff and great carne asada and al pastor tacos  AND it's close to home. Will be back soon to try the other offerings. May not have to drive all the way to Tacos el Gordo anymore :)"}
{"text":"Delishhhhh 
Identical to Tacos el Gordon only cleaner, Friendly, and English speaking!"}
{"text":"Holy crap on a cracker!!!! How have I waited so long to try this place out?! This place is really good and unique! The tacos are fresh and the combination of flavors is to die for! The staff was really nice. I got the el pastor tacos with everything and street style corn on the cob, and my boyfriend and i shared the carne asada nachos. I was stuffed!!! I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I looooove tacos. Especially the Al Pastor tacos with extra pineapples. Yum, yum, yum! 

Based on my current experience, Taco Y Taco is one the best places to get those authentic street tacos. It's like a fancier, more upscale Tacos El Gordo. It's very clean and there's a lot of seating, even a second floor and outside patio (both of which I've never sat at but would like to eventually). 

Ordering is simple: you stand in the line that corresponds to the type of meat you want. It's about $2 to $2.50 for a taco. Then move down the line if you want anything extra like chips & guac, a burrito, elotes (yummy, yummy street corn), or carne asada fries! 

You get your drinks at the register. They have an abundance of drinks in a bottle from the bar, cans of soda, or just the fountain drinks. 

They also have a sauce bar with a non-spicy avocado sauce, hot habanero or hot pastor, and about three other sauces. So many options, all delicious. 

I love coming here for tacos and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place had quality tacos and a fun and easygoing atmosphere. We have had a couple large group gatherings here and the staff was very accommodating.

However, seating was limited and we were not informed that there would be an issue. Additionally, the environment was a bit excessively loud and it was not due to our group...

Overall; customer service was great, food was delicious, environment was loud."}
{"text":"A hidden Taco gem. Down the street from work and craving for some Mexican food, Taco Y Taco, can't go wrong with that. Order a Barbocoa burrito which is a behemoth of a size comparable to Chipotle's burritos. Added guacamole which they do not skimp on. I will say the Barbocoa is a bit on the salty side, but that will not deter me from coming back. The burritos were not on the light side of lunch for me, should have eaten half. The salsa bar has a great selection of salsa, limes, with two choices of beans. Next visit will be the el pastor or the gran taco."}
{"text":"2 star because the food is actually good, but be warned, you may wanna pay attention to the total they ring up. Twice I have been charged incorrectly, one of which didn't even occur till I saw my bank statement. Added a tip I didn't authorize or something of that nature. Their menus are misleading as well. Vampiros are clearly listed on a menu with a price tag of 2.15 (my memory is foggy, but it's for sure listed as under 3 dollars), however when asking the lady at the register, she laughed and said no. Turns out their almost 4 bucks. If shady business practices don't discourage you, the food is actually good. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, great food! Vibe here is very different than the Tropicana location, very hip, there's often a live DJ playing here, almost a food truck/foodie vibe, definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"My brother on the east side turned me on to this place.  I'm on the west side of Vegas and don't get over to his side to explore the restaurant scene as much as I'd like.  We are both Mexican food junkies and suckers for good Al Pastor.  The place is larger than you might think.  The flow of the restaurant is a little off, and ordering is a bit confusing.  You would think everyone would get a tray and start at station 1, but it didn't seem to work that way.  Folks were \"cutting in line\" at other stations and it seemed to slow things up.  Station1 was the Al Pastor, and I tried two of them.  Watching the prep told you how authentic it was and how awesome it was going to taste.  Station 2 was other proteins/preparations, like Carne Asada and Carnitas. I tried one of the Carnitas.  The prep cook pulled a nice chunk out of a bath of juice, chopped it up and piled it high.  On to station 3, where you could get burrito bowls, Mexican corn and other side.  One Mexican corn for me.  Oh, and beer on tap and in the bottle.  One cold bottle of Modelo.  Does this sound like a feast or what?  On to the salsa bar, which includes warm beans.  I wanted a better selection of salsa, and larger cups to put it into.  The tacos were wonderful.  The tortillas were perfect, with just a few seconds on the grill.  The meat was so flavorful.  The corn was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The prices were right.  This is the real deal.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Since the place is called Taco and Taco I figured I'd try out their tacos. They have 3 lines for ordering. If you want to have INSANELY good Tacos Al Pastor go to line 1 and ask for everything on them. 
Sometimes I don't like all the adds and sauces place put on their food, but this was amazing. 
Aside from having great tacos the restaurant is clean and has a great look. 
I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos and burritos. They have at least 12 kinds of meats to choose from, and they prepare it fresh to order. You order your burrito and they melt cheese on it before they add ingredients! Amazing. After you create your burrito, you can head over to the street taco stations where you have fresh tacos made to order. The salsa bar is super extensive and they have a huge variety of fresh salsas.
Everyone here is super friendly, and they even gave us some samples of some of their meats since we told them it was our first time there. Everything we ordered was delicious, so you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have a nice vegetarian menu, which is pretty awesome. This is my favorite authentic mexican food in Vegas."}
{"text":"When Taco Y Taco opened I really loved it. It seems that the cleanliness at both locations has really gone on the back burner. The salsa bar could use much more attention as far as keeping it looking fresh and appetizing. The tables never seem to get wiped down throughly. 
  As far as food options burritos,street tacos, quesadillas,tostadas etc. all authentic style Mexican fare. Oh and Mexican Street corn as well. For the non meat eaters they have veggie options as well as a Soyrizo offering. I find the Soyrizo slightly too salty for my taste. They offer all the meats including carne asada, chicken, al pastor, carnitas etc. 
 They have a couple bottle beer options at Tropicana location and drafts and liquor at the Eastern location. Full soda bar and those tasty Mexican sodas \"Jarritos\", love those."}
{"text":"This place is horrible . Dropping meat on the floor and still serving it . Not to mention the crazy food lines . I left without even ordering . Never going back I'll just settle for some Taco Bell"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food was not too bad. The service is not the greatest though. When I walk up to make an order, most times the staff seem like they dont want to be bothered. No smiles or greetings then when it was time to pay, I was the last one in line and the woman walked away from the register and went in the back for a few minutes, came out and said she will be with me shortly but walked away again and then did not come back for what had to be 4-5 minutes and by then, the line was long again. 

The food is ok, I have only have the Nachos and carne asada fries and elote which I was not a big fan of. It tastes better in California. I couldn't give more stars strictly because of the service, it doesn't make me want to come back so quickly especially when there are so many other Mexican food places to try in the area."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Mexican street tacos. I have to show some restraint every time I come here. On multiple occasions I've put away double digit tacos. If you're able, coming here at non peak times is your best bet, because it can get crowded in the parking lot and in the restaurant lines. Having some taco eating partners to stand in separate lines and order will also make life a little easier for you.

If you'd like to get away from the standard chicken and carne asada (which is still good also), this is the place to do it. There are so many different types of meat that are sliced fresh and put onto your corn tortilla and topped with mainly onion, cilantro, and guacamole. With the pineapple, the al pastor is great and not found in every taco shop. I also like the lengua, cabeza, chorizo, and adobada. If you need a little crunch, you can sandwich the meat and cheese between two tortillas to make a vampiro.

The salsa station and the bar is what sets Taco Y Taco apart from the others. There are so many side items and salsa and you're sure to find a combination that works for you. You name it, spicy, mild, radishes, beans, pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc. And what goes best with your tacos? How about a Modelo or a margarita? There's plenty of room in the restaurant including tables upstairs once you get your food.

Each taco will set you back two dollars and change. They also have a pretty decent happy hour. Don't give up on the place if you get frustrated, because once you get the ordering down, there's so much to discover and try."}
{"text":"Taco Y Taco is great authentic Mexican food spot in Las Vegas. I find it nicer than Tacos El Gordo. They have a cleaner presentation of food handling and the ambiance is nice. It used to be a American restaurant, but it was shut down.

This is a great location and a good spot especially on a busy business shopping area. They have amazing food choices and you can see the way the food is prepared through the windows and if you want Elote they make it right in front of you. I've ordered the carne asada fries and tacos and I say they are both great especially with all the sauces you can put together. 

If you want a great inexpensive Mexican food place, Taco y Taco is a place to go!"}
{"text":"The size of the asada burrito in the first photo is very misleading. I ordered one and it was rather small in comparison to the picture, probably 1/2 the size, and much smaller than your typical Roberto's type place.

However, the carne had great flavor and the quality of the ingredients were quite good as well. So, definite plus on the flavor.

Staff we're friendly and speaking Spanglish was definitely a plus on getting my order placed. Salsa bar has a good variety but nothing is labeled and can be confusing.

If the quantity matched the quality they would've gained another star."}
{"text":"I love this place super amazing Mexican food they have the best street tacos and the have corn on the cob they have a very small bar and we love there salsa bar amazing staff is always very nice must have."}
{"text":"The staff needs a lesson on what \"any social media\" means.  It doesn't mean just Facebook.  I mention this because there is a posted sign by where you order a burrito, in which any social media check-in gives a free elote.  I luckily had Facebook, but my girlfriend disabled hers awhile back and when she showed her Yelp check-in nearly everyone in the kitchen was yelling, \"Facebook only!\"  The younger cashier understood the clearly marked sign and offered to deliver 2 rightfully earned elotes to our table.  I guess the cashier forgot, so we asked her about our corn, which she said she would bring right out after apologizing to us.  We overheard the kitchen staff loudly asking her in Spanish why two elotes were being given to us...  Sigh, we each got an elote in the end thanks to the cashier's diligence and reading comprehension.

Another thing, the price of burritos has gone up.  Our usual order of 2 burritos used to be $16 something and now it is $19 and some change.  I will be looking elsewhere for Mexican food when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome taco's! Delicious and so great how fresh and how you can watch them cut up your choosing of meat. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I recommend everything on the menu. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the music. It's always waaaaay to loud. I'm fine with noise, but I feel like I'm screaming when I'm talking. Turn it down a smidge."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Found it on yelp. Not much more to add that these reviews don't have covered already. And hey, the pinball hall of fame is right down the street!!!!"}
{"text":"I love taco y taco!! My favorite place to relax after a long day and get some great food. Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"It's a sad story, really. Used to LOVE this place.

On my last visit to this establishment, I decided to try something new, than what I usually would go for. Decided to try a vampiro, which, of course, has melted cheese. I follow the guy making my order, only to notice that some of the melted cheese dripped onto his APRON... What does he do with that melted goodness, you ask me? He SCOOPS it up and dumps it onto my Vampiro (he did not notice me watching him, or did he?) like nothing happened. 

I, of course, brought it to the fellow cook's attention, who saw it all go down, who shrugged I off and asked if I wanted them to make a new one. NO I DON'T!

I complained to the manager who about this whole ordeal who was able to offer a half assed apology. That's it? I was about to eat off this fuck's stomach. Adios!"}
{"text":"This place can be sort of confusing if it's your first time. Basically, you go to where there are signs saying the type of meat and just wait in line and tell the cook what you want. After getting everything that you wanted, walk over to the cashier and pay. Right in the middle of all this is the condiments bar with a variety of sauces, limes, and etc.

The cashier forgot to ask if I wanted anything to drink ( I had forgotten to even get a drink) before I paid and she decided to ask me after I was walking away. I didn't feel like putting everything down and pulling out my wallet again so no thanks. 

The place is 2 stories so if the lower level is full, you can always go upstairs for extra seating. I also noticed it was quite hot in there - maybe their a/c went out.

I went with 3 lengua tacos with everything and that was around $7-8. It was pretty good but didn't fill me up. I might come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Originally chose to eat here for the Elotes, but sadly they didn't have any corn that day. Incredibly sad. We did end up ordering Al Pastor and Asada tacos with an Asada Burrito and chorizo nachos. It was my last day in Vegas and the boyfriend wanted to make sure I was incredibly full for the mere 1 hour plane ride home. Ha. Their side bar was fully stocked with beans, sauces, and veggies. There was definitely something for everyone. I admit, we demolished the food and was left with a quarter of the burrito. As we walked...more like waddled to the car, we were hit with the painful reminder to not stuff our faces till we puke. Otherwise, it was some pretty good food and such a spacious restaurant. I was to see the Banda was about to play as we were leaving. Oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is my favorite taco place in Las Vegas/Henderson, specifically the one on Eastern. My friends usually go to the Taco y Taco that is close to UNLV, but I thought that location was quite ghetto due to its location and interior. The Taco y Taco at UNLV is not as clean as the one on Eastern. I really enjoy this Taco y Taco because of its modern vibe as well as the chance to listen to a live mariachi band play from time to time.

Taco y Taco has the best al pastor tacos that you can find in Vegas! Their al pastor tacos are very flavorful, and the toppings are definitely on point. Something I also really enjoy are their elotes! Their elotes are the best elotes I have ever eaten because they are not overpowered with tajin, and they have the perfect flavor.

Something that you should be prepared for is the wait. Since this place is very popular within this neighborhood as well as across the valley, there will be long lines even on days where the live mariachi band is not playing and on days when it is not taco Tuesdays. However, the wait is definitely worth it since the food is really good!"}
{"text":"Fisrt time here and let me put it like this, I felt I was  \"helped\" by zombies. Creatures with no facial expression and absolutely no manners. Tacos are ok but I know where to find same flavor or better ones somewhere else...so....I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We came here after a wedding reception that took place in the same shopping complex and was not impressed at all. The guy who made the tacos was rude and I'm sorry but the price for their tacos are ridiculous. My boyfriend got the Vampiro and the miniature tostadas were burn and not worth the $4. I had a taco de lengua and i had a nasty after taste left in my mouth from it and I've had many of these tacos before and never had a bad after taste from it. Also, another customer came in and one of the guys was rude to her because they were getting ready to close and he didn't want to make her To Go order. Maybe next time, turn off your OPEN sign and lock the door if it's that big of deal. I've worked in food service and I get it, it's annoying but you still need to maintain good customer service regardless. And there's no need to be throwing a fit and slamming pots and pans when you have customers sitting down eating there food!!!!!! Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Tacos de Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Cabeza, Chicharron were great. 

There are 8 kinds of salsas on the Salsa Bar along with beans (Peruanos and black), carrots, cucumbers and onions/ jalapeños. 

Place is SUPER clean and great customer service. 

Definitely coming back next trip!

Or tomorrow !!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and i became hooked since they opened, staff was really friendly and food was great, freshly made with great authentic taste. Owners opened up another location Eastern and 215 great for them but now they have increased prices, cut down portions, taken out items that made it great, friendly staff just a bit, not like it use to be."}
{"text":"I'm never going back to this location. I was in line at the al pastor station and I ordered 4 tacos, I saw the cook put the old al pastor meat that was sitting on the grill on a plate and set it aside (I figured he was going to slice fresh meat for my tacos and get rid of the old meat). Then a guy behind me who spoke spanish ordered 4 al pastor tacos and the cook sliced off fresh al pastor and gave him his tacos first and then used the old al pastor meat to make my tacos.  I would recommend Tacos El Gordo over this place any day."}
{"text":"It pains me to say this because I love this place and have been coming here for along time. Unfortunately this is my third bad experience aim 2 days. The first of which was when I showed up the other day at 11 to grab lunch. There were already several people there before me. I say this because was no pastor ready (it was still cooking), there was one person working all the lines while the rest of the staff was talking and fooling around in the back. Needless to say I waited for 30 min to get my food. The second and third  instances happened on the same day. I ordered 2 burritos and after getting them realize that there was no hair sauce etc. I went to my table to put  things down and to ask if there was any hot sauce. In then the time it took do do that the items were gone.  What upsets me the most is that the owner/managing partner didn't seem to care about either situation and carried on with her conversation while the dining room literally became over ran with spills, over filled trash cans and dirty tables. Ultimately, items can be replaced, but it's hard to change perceptions once you've had repeated bad experiences from a place you admired and love going too."}
{"text":"Dang, what happened to this place? I feel like the place has aged a lot since our last visit. So much duct tape In the booth seats. We came to eat a late dinner when we got to Vegas our first night. Thankfully the place was empty, so there weren't crazy, wayward lines of people to fight off to get to the counter, lol. The guy making quesadillas, burritos, and street corn was the nicest and most helpful. Sadly the street corn and horchata was just alright, nothing special like I remembered."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely won't be the last!  The chicken burrito was the best I've had in a long time!  Ordering process was weird at first, but will know where to go next time.

Ok, was so excited about how great the food was,  I took my daughters the next day to get the same burrito. I was completely disappointed. How does a taco restaurant run out of chicken, black beans and peppers/onion mix??  All my favorites that make a burrito.  Not sure if my daughters would ever give it a 2nd chance :("}
{"text":"These are by far the best tacos in Las Vegas! Even better than TEG my previous reference and I believe the inspiration for Taco Taco, methinks the student has surpassed his master. I had the Great Bandini trifecta: Asada, Carnitas, and Pastor, all the meats had tremendous flavor and the servings were generous. The Pastor may be the best I've ever had even better than TEG in Tijuana.

Please go NOW to Taco Taco, the work they are doing is wildly important, they deserve our support."}
{"text":"Essentially I compare every Mexican place to Tacos El Gordo....

Pros:
1. Mexican street corn with cotija/mayo/chili powder is amazing here (not offered at Gordo)  
2. Vampiros, which is essentially a tostada sandwich and delicious and packed with meat. (2 of these will make you full)
3. Good selection at the salsa bar and extra veggies available.

Cons: 
1.  Tacos al pastor was way too salty
2.  Seemed pricier than tacos el gordo...either that or the cashier overcharged us

Overall, I still prefer Tacos El Gordo for the flavor of the al pastor.  But if you go here you must try the elote (mexican corn), I could eat this all day!"}
{"text":"Ordinarily I would never review a restaurant where I had eaten on its first day of operation.

But I'm going to make an exception for Taco Taco, because this place is LEGIT.

The standard by which I judge all other tacos in Las Vegas is Tacos El Gordo, and specifically the adobada that they roast all day long on a spit.

Well, taco fans, I can tell you that the pastor here ranks right up there. It's a little bit less spicy and a little more cumin flavor than the pork at El Gordo. I can't say it's better than the best but it's right up there. And like El Gordo, they make their own tortillas fresh right behind the counter.

The pollo taco (an option absent from the TEG menu, incidentally) was flavorful as well, and the asada was savory and tender but the real standout was the soyrizo taco.

You heard me. Soyrizo.

Vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants typically make me feel like I'm missing something. But not with this. The flavorful, spicy fauxsage comes out topped with black beans - the perfect complement.

Best of all? You can pimp out your meal with your choice of eight salsas and two kinds of beans, plus jalapenos and cebollitas.

On the whole I'd describe Taco Taco as a hybrid of the authenticity of TEG and the attention to ingredients and health consciousness that you find at places like Zabas or Chipotle.

I don't often find myself on the east side these days but it's good to know an awesome taco spot is there when I do make it over."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco dethroned Tacos el Gordo as my favorite taco in Vegas, for a variety of reasons, most of which having to do with a bigger menu.

1) Chicken
2) Fajita vegetables
3) Salsa bar
4) Nachos
5) Vegetarian options
6) Burritos

Like El Gordo, and like the original, less upscale Taco y Taco location, you queue up at different stations for different meats in your taco. I've found the carne asada and pollo to be phenomenal. The adobada is on a par with el Gordo.

Taco y Taco also has a full bar with happy hour specials, music and a large dining room. But I mostly just come here for the chicken fajita burritos, which are as good as any I've eaten."}
{"text":"Lets talk tacos for a moment... Alpastor, yes please. cut right off onto my freshly grilled tortillas topped with some onion and cilantro a little sauce and some pineapple... It was great. We also picked up some corn in one of the many lines to choose from when you go up to order and we decided to get it mexican street style, now not to downplay the alpastor tacos but the Mexican street style corn was the highlight, perfectly cooked sweet corn with all the fixins is enough to make you come back for more. The salsa bar also had some great options and I would definitely recommend the habanero salsa.

Now, lets get to the few things I was not see excited about.

1.) Pick a line any line- If you want an alpastor taco and a carnita taco it is in two separate lines and then if you need to pick up some corn you have to get in another line.

2.) Pay for your meal- Yes it is another line, It really reminded me of a college cafeteria, walk the line get what you want and then the dude in the hairnet at the end will ring you up.

3.) Cleanliness- most of the tables in the dining area had not been wiped down or cleaned and it just made the entire place seem dirty. 

Overall, Yeah i will probably end up here a time or few again but I don't know know that I will be making it my go to taco spot."}
{"text":"Without a doubt some of the most delicious Mexican food I have ever eaten. It's kind of like Roberto's for people who somewhat care about their health and aren't housed out of their minds at 4:00 in morning. Their tacos are small, but tasty. The nachos aren't deep-fried and are loaded with fresh meat of your choice (I prefer chicken) and other equally fresh ingredients (only I wish they'd use less sour cream sometimes). The only drawback is they are not open 24/7. Still, go here if you want to save yourself money as well as calories. Also, they serve Mexican beer which is always nice to have with a meal."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab authentic and fresh tacos somewhat fast food style. Huge selection and freshly made. They have several lines where you can order the style of taco & food you want, pay and then seat yourself. They have some beers on tap which is pretty cool. Chill vibes & overall great food."}
{"text":"I had the al pastor, carnitas, and shrimp tacos with everything on them. They were really fresh and tasty, although the carnitas was not the best I've had. Next time I'll just go for the al pastor and shrimp gran tacos. They're not cheap, but then again I'm basing the price off of LA tacos. I had a taste of the carne asada meat from my son's burrito. It was ok. He liked his burrito though so it was all good.  Mom enjoyed her chicken tacos as well. We'll be back next time we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love that this place has authentic Mexican & Latin meats for your taco. Very tasty & reasonable for your money.  Salsas are spot on.  I really enjoyed this place :-)"}
{"text":"if you're coming to eat here, you have to try the Vampiro (it's not as scary as it sounds) and the El Pastor tacos. They're something you can sink your teeth into. LOL"}
{"text":"Food is great, the ordering is pretty simple the only thing that bothered me was the lady working at the bowl and burrito station shortly after ordering she mentioned something about tipping then she scooted the tip jar closer to me! Me working in the food and beverage industry would never do that, made me feel uncomfortable and awkward."}
{"text":"I had the nachos, nothing special but it's massive. The barbacoa meat is good! Will be my fave the next time I come back. Oh on Saturday night they have a DJ which creates a fun ambience"}
{"text":"This place has really good tacos. They have street corn which you don't see too often in taco shops. They also have FREE beans at the condiment bar. The place is decorated really cute and they sometimes have a DJ."}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is becoming an addiction. I have started to crave it. Terrible, yet SO good! 
If its your first time, the process can be a bit confusing compared to the normal sit down restaurant. The food is setup into stations, each serving different specialties. Start at the front and work your way to the cashier. Once you decide on your beverage of choice and pay, I suggest finding a place to sit and heading straight back to the complimentary salsa bar! 
As for the food, I don't think you can go wrong. Ordering fresh chips (under 2$) to share with your table is never a bad idea! They're thick, crunchy, and help you taste test the entire salsa bar! The only meat I have ordered thus far has been the al pastor (the addiction), and it is amazing in both the tacos and vampiros (pretty much a tostada sandwich). 
The cooks are helpful too, even if you are as confused as I was the first time ordering!"}
{"text":"This place definitely hits the spot when I have a craving for authentic street tacos. 

Like a lot of Yelpers have mentioned, their ordering system is pretty confusing when you first enter, and none of the staff really helped clarify. So far, I've just gone to the \"line\" directly next to the cashier, ordered all the tacos I want that day- regardless of my meat preference- and no one has directed me to go to any different \"line.\"

Their service is prompt, their tacos are amazing, and I can't get enough of their horchata."}
{"text":"Food is so good! Best tacos in town! The salsa bar is awesome. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"First expect to be confused and frustrated... I was warned, and read the reviews, so I was prepared... I can't imagine how it would be during peak hours. The way you order and pay in separate lines for different items is wacky!!
The music is loud... 
Suck it up, your not here for service, or to feel especially welcome. Your here for tacos, and that's what they deliver. 
I only had two (plus nachos, waste of time).
The pastor was great, a little heavy handed with the pineapple salsa. But I won't ask them to change a thing for me.
The carnitas tacos were dressed entirely different than the pastor, and just as bold and delicious.
The salsa bar may take me 5 more vists to really get into, cause the tacos are so right, I don't need any salsa. The pickled veggies in several varieties is worth a run.
The nachos were ok.. If the tacos weren't so good, I'd have liked them more. I realized i cheated myself out of an additional taco by having them. 
Short version:
Definitely coming back. 
It will be loud, ordering won't make sense; the staff will try (in vein) to make it seem that this all makes sense to them, but I won't care. I'm not here for order, or quiet.
Keep your eye on the prize...
I'm here for the tacos.
Taco y Taco"}
{"text":"Very good tacos and great customer service.  I was in Las Vegas with a bunch of relatives.  We decided to order something for eating in and tacos were the only thing that every one of us were able to agree on.  Because it took my family so long to decide on food, the lunch hour was upon us.  We tried to place an order via phone, but no one picked up so we decided to chance it and go directly to the restaurant to place our order of 50+ items (mostly street tacos)!  They were shocked but very accommodating.  It was actually just past 11am on a weekday so there wasn't a lunch time rush yet.  They were able to fulfill our order in under 30 minutes.  I felt bad for the lady who had to pour out the batter and make the tortilla for each of the tacos we ordered, but it was nice to know that everything is made fresh.  A generous tip was left!  

We tried the carne asada fries, carne asada tacos, al pastor tacos, and barbacoa tacos... all were delicious and a couple of burritos.  For the tacos, they also put the toppings and sauce on the side so that we could dress them as we pleased (which was great for some of my picky eaters)."}
{"text":"After watching everyone check in here, I had to try it for myself. This is not your typical american mexican restaurant but rather it is designed to be an authentic taqueria.  Set up with stations where you can get al pastor, tacos, burritos, and specialty items, you get your tray, pick your items, some are warmed up right in front of you, and then pay per item.  The items are reasonably priced with the average taco priced around $2.25.  It is served up cafeteria style, meaning the food is already preprepared and only a little warming up on the griddle is necessary.  I expected the food to be dried out having been premade but it was surprisingly tender and moist.
There are TV's around the room so you don't miss the big game.  There is a small bar as well.  The staff is friendly but to be honest, I could barely understand what the servers were offering me.  It is a good idea to know what the different foods names are before you go in, or speak spanish.

Still, I enjoyed everything I tried and will be back."}
{"text":"The food is super delicious!  It even beats the yumminess I would get when I lived in San Diego.  If pork is your thing, do not miss out on the al pastor fries.  Elote corn is also available and is delicious!

Service is great and prices are even better!  Full service bar stocked with all the fixings for your favorite drinks.  If you live in the Henderson area, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Very good place, the closest thing in Mexican tacos, the very good sauces and the quality service at an affordable price"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this small establishment.  However, today came in and there was a line to order tacos.  As we waited and ordered from the Al Pastor line there was a quick serve, when it was my turn to order a carnitas and lengua taco I was  told to go to the next server.  4 people cut ahead and were being served.  At this time my boyfriend asked if we could be served and the server became rude and told us to calm down.  I could not believe how we were being addressed.  Being Mexican myself I was just embarrassed of his tone and the impression he was leaving with the rest of the guests in line.  We were told they were short handed but this does not excuse the taquero to treat us in such a rude way.  
Hopefully after reading this Taco y Taco will address this concern and treat all their customers kindly and without excuses.
The food is delicious as always but the service is what draws customers back as well!"}
{"text":"Good setup of customizing your own taco or burrito where they make it in front of you.

The carnitas was pretty tasty! I would come back for more."}
{"text":"Tacos and corn and horchata oh my! Seriously some of the best tacos I've had in Vegas. From traditional tacos like lengua to the more mellow kinds for those of us who aren't that adventurous like asada. Extremely friendly staff who's definitely willing to let you taste test if you just aren't sure. Sometime there's a little slacking when it comes to refilling the drink machines or the salsa bar but overall everything seems in order."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on 5/15. This Mexican joint reminded me of Mexico but just cleaner. There are separate lines depending on what you want to order. I ordered nachos and my husband ordered a carne asada burrito and a couple tacos de pastor. The lady making my nachos was very nice. She steamed my chips with the cheese on it and the cheese became melty goodness. The guacamole was actual fresh guacamole. None of that nasty store bought guac. The carne asada had too much fat on it. That was my only problem with my order. The parts that didn't have fat did taste good though. My husband enjoyed his burrito and tacos. No complaints from him. The corn tortillas are hand made. The jamaica was yummy and refreshing. Free refills. This place has a salsa bar but in the salsa bar you could also get black beans or refried beans :) This place was good and it's as close as you can get to Mexico."}
{"text":"Already a fan of the location on East Tropicana, I was excited when Tia Shirley B. informed me that a new Taco y Taco would be opening in this part of Henderson, close to where I work, work out often, and have many friends who live in the area (including Shirley B.).  A friend and I headed here last Saturday after a long training ride, ready to get our taco on.
     Just after opening at 11:00am, we walked in to find a spacious restaurant complete with bright lighting, high ceilings, a bar, and staff that greeted us heartily; this used to be the Republic Kitchen & Bar restaurant, so it may be the nicest taco place I've visited. I was quite surprised to see a DJ mixing tunes at that time of day, but not a bad thing. There were a couple of other customers already eating and the place got progressively busier during our visit.
      Set up like the other location, there are stations where you can order tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.
     Meat choices: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).   There's a salsa bar with lots of options for you to add to your order.
    I had two al pastor tacos with pineapple, a carnitas vampiro (two crispy tortillas with the meat and cheese inside), and Mexican street corn on the cob (elote) with the works (mayo, cheese, and chili powder)--I was hungry one minute and then full the next.  My friend had never been to Taco y Taco before and he gobbled up his food before I finished.   
   This Taco y Taco gets five stars from me for the location, the tasty food, and the service; I'll definitely be here a lot.  BTW, for those fellow Yeeps who've been missing Tia Shirley B. while she's been off Yelp, she's been here almost every day since they opened so you may see her when you visit!  Buen provecho, mis amigos--la vida es demasiada corta para ser descontento o comer comida mala."}
{"text":"Me gusta mucho.
 After a disappointing taco experience a week ago, I wanted to erase that memory with someplace better.  Taco y Taco definitely fit the bill.  Making last minute plans with the b/f and BFF, the three of us met up for dinner around 7:00pm on a Thursday night. 

MENU SUMMARY:
 Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.  I don't know what a mula is, but we found out that a vampiro is made up of two crispy tortillas with cheese and your choice of meat in the middle.
 The meats: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).  

 We were offered a sample of their al pastor when we first approached the counter; this is what it's supposed to taste like!  Whatever I had last week did not compare to this flavorful meat.  I ultimately opted for two asada tacos and the elote, Mexican street style.  Those choices cost less than $7.  There is a salsa bar available so you can jazz things up if you want, as well.  I had my tacos made simply, with onions, cilantro, and salsa and they were both delicious.  The mere fact that they offer elote alone will keep me coming back:  I love that stuff.  For $2, I got a very large ear of corn on a stick with everything, which means mayo (yes, mayo), cheese, and chili powder:  fabuloso!  
 The place is spacious and clean and the staff is very personable.  We stayed for over 2.5 hours, enjoying their food and our conversation.  Definitely look forward to another visit soon;  barato y delicioso!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  I like the salsa bar they had , but the service was a little slow.  If I had a choice I would still go to Chipotle, but may I give this place another shot.   Also more expensive than chipotle."}
{"text":"I love love love Taco Y Taco. My favorite is the vampiro. The carne asada is delicious but I have to say the best thing is the corn. The counter ordering  is a bit awkward but once you've been a few times you get the system down."}
{"text":"Ordering here is really complicated but the staff is friendly and didn't mind explaining how it worked multiple times. I'm glad the ordering process didn't turn me off because the food is fantastic. Not only is it authentic, this place is really clean! I tried pretty much everything, burrito, nachos, tacos, horchata! The meats were super tender and flavorful. The portions aren't huge but they are generous enough. The salsa bar was also great!!"}
{"text":"We went for my husbands birthday and it was perfect. The food was great and they let us use the upstairs so that we could all sit together."}
{"text":"Wow, this is the real deal. Tried the carnitas, pibil and barbacoa tacos. All excellent. Hard to say which one I liked the most. It was late so they ran out of al pastor so will have to return soon. This is a must try. Better than Tacos el Gordo."}
{"text":"First Time at Taco Y Taco.  Not sure what I was expecting when I walked in the door.  But I know it wasn't not that lol.  Place looks upscale for a fast food Mexican place.

I will say the way they have their ordering system is confusing and seems alittle anti customer service for me.  They have 4 different lines.  1 For Al Pastor tacos 1 for Carne asada chicken and chorizo tacos 1 for tacos with one of the other 8 items.  Then another line for everything else.  And if that's not bad enough then there's another line to pay.   Not sure why for the life of me only 1 register was open out of 2.  At one point there was 9 to 10 people in line to pay.

Now for the food..  Oh my it was good.  We has a Carntas Bowl.  Mexical street corn.  And Carne Asada, Carnitas, Al Pastor, Barbacoa and Chorizo
 Tacos.  It was all flavorful and great.  Corn could have used a bit more mayo on it but it was good.

Best part you can enjoy a drink from the bar.  We had some beers.

Over all this place is great.  Turn offs happy hours doesn't start till 5pm.  And just poor ordering system.

I say try it out.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a bad experience with the food. Place is nice, ok customer service but the FOOD deserves an F. The meat did not have flavor (Asada), cold and not a good presentation view from the customer side. Tortillas were cold and overall no flavor. This place has potential because is located inside a busy shopping center. In addition the restaurant has an hacienda look and feeling but sad to say the food was not good. The guacamole was dark instead of fresh and green. See the picture. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"All I can say is omfg!!! I've been looking for the perfect taco place. You know the place that has the perfectly marinated and so tender carne asada, and fresh delicious tasty chicken! This is my new favorite restaurant. I'm in love. I'm from California and it made me feel like I was back home, the food is so perfect. I ordered three corns, six tacos, a burrito, and a side of rice and beans. For my husband, my daughter, and myself. We almost never finish our food, but we ate it all!! When I took my first bite I could not stop saying omg omg omg. Soooo delicious, I'm so happy, I finally found the perfect taco spot. The salsas are all amazing, the prices are great! I will literally never waste my money at Roberto's or Pepe's tacos ever again."}
{"text":"This place is for the taco conoseiur... They have it all: beef, pork, fish, chicken, and shrimp. You line up in line, order your tacos, and they make them right in front of you. The tacos are small - street style - but pack a serious amount of flavor!

Hubby ordered the chicken and carne asada tacos. I ordered the shrimp and fish tacos. They also sell Mexican street corn, too, but beware - if you want it cut off of the cob they charge you an extra $2 just for that.

The tacos were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The meat was nicely accompanied by lettuce, pico, and a spicy sauce (chipotle maybe). So for 8 tacos, Mexican corn, and a coke, it came to about $35. Kind of steep, but you get what you pay for here. I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's okay the other location is way better. Decent meat decent service. Rather make the drive down to Henderson. 4 stars"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Taco y Taco, I question whether I'm actually at a taco joint or a cafe in New Orleans that has live jazz on Wednesday nights. The decor and style of the place definitely doesn't match the food they sell, that's for sure.

There are 3 different ordering stations, a cash register, and a condiment bar. At the ordering stations, meat is carved and prepared in whatever fashion you prefer (tacos, tostadas, fries, etc.). You can then head over to the cash register and possibly order an elotes (Mexican corn). The condiment bar features 6-8 sauces of varying spice levels, fresh radish, grilled onion, pickled onion and peppers, and white or black beans. That's pretty rad.

I usually get the tacos, elotes, and horchata. To be frank, I don't find any of their food all that amazing. It's pretty good but there's just something missing in terms of flavor. The tortillas aren't my favorite, the tripas is never crispy, among other things. However, the marriage between the al pastor and pineapple chunks is pretty on point. The horchata is sometimes too sweet/thick as well. The elotes looks bomb but is actually pretty bland.

The convenient hours, location, and consistent food and plentiful condiment bar will keep me coming back every now and then."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for $1 National Taco Day 10/4/15. We bought 10 tacos over 3 transactions. 

Al Pastor - very good
Barbacoa - good
Cabeza - bad*
Carnitas - good
Lengua - good
Tripa - very good 

Best part: they take cards and with no minimum!
Worst part: lots of dirty tables that needed bussed.

You need very minimal Spanish to order. But, \"no cilantro\" is the same in English and Spanish, yet Brian P. was given a generous heap of cilantro on his carnitas despite saying it 3 times.

*I threw up immediately after exiting the car on the ride home. I felt immediately nauseous after eating this taco."}
{"text":"Very yummy. If you aren't open minded about trying different yet authentic mexican food, this place ain't the place for you. Taco Bell is always down the street for you. Otherwise, the tacos are delicious. They are street tacos. (Ever been to Tacos El Gordo? Yeah their tacos are like that but way fresher and more flavor.) I got the tacos al pastor and lengua which was delicious. They had a cool salsa bar with of course, fresh mild to spicy salsa. I had a drink of their horchata which was also delicious. The only downfall is that I live all the way in Mountain's Edge and it is quite a drive to get here, but it is worth it. I will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Taco y Taco is right around the corner from my house and I have been meaning to try it. A friend went there and said it was OK, but other places were better, so it wasn't on the priority list. Our favorite taco shop was closed last night, so we figured Taco y Taco was worth giving a try.

They were fairly busy when we walked in, as the fancily dressed manager lady was helping to maintain the dining area's appearance. 

We were greeted with smiles as we ordered our food. When I saw how they heated up the burrito tortillas, I knew I was going to have issues. I am not, and never have been, a fan of warming up tortillas in steam. This makes them sticky and gooey. 

Anyway, I made my burrito, and the wife had her burrito bowl made up before us. Looking at the menu, she wanted chips and guac.
Side of chips: 1.05
Side of Guac: 1.25
Chips & Guac: 2.95

WTF? So, she ordered a side of guac and I ordered a side of chips. Making our way down the line of taco options, we opted to just give one dish a try for the evening. When we were giving details of our order to the cashier, the wife said what her bowl was, and a side of guac. I gave info on my burrito plus a side of chips. The cashier gave us a smirk and said she was going to ring them up separate, since it is cheaper that way. We replied by informing her that's why we ordered it as we did.

The soda machine, for the one flavor the wife wanted, was broke, they were kind enough to just give her a bottled soda.

Sitting down to eat, the burrito was the length of a plastic fork (see photos) and had less circumference than a can of soda. 

Picking up my chicken burrito, it was already cold (partially due to the pile of sour cream I had included, I am sure). Oh well, I wasn't shied away by that fact. The stickiness of the tortilla was tough to get over. I prefer a crispy burrito to a soggy, sticky one.

Flavor-wise, it was good. Nothing to write home about, but it was good. 

Their chips were great. I don't know what they do different to them, but they were very tasty, nice crunch and fresh.

If the standard places we prefer to go are closed, or we just don't feel like driving that far, Taco y Taco may get a second chance. Otherwise, we'll stick with Baja Bar & Grill, Chipotle or Zabas."}
{"text":"All the tacos were amazing and in order of awesomeness would be: Al pastor; lengua; carnitas; pollo; chorizo and carne asada. Good value for money and nice setting. They need 2 lines for Al pastor as it's a long wait because of its popularity."}
{"text":"YUM!!!

This place has been on my list of bookmarks forever. I wasn't able to \"dine in\" during this visit, so this review is strictly for take-out.

First of all, I really dislike places with small/tight parking lots.  And this is one is super small. It's always packed in the lot and I feel like there are accidents just waiting to happen...

I was here on a weekday, around 1pm. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in, but was pleasantly surprised.  The décor is cute and I like the vibe, it's like someone took a taco shop and covered it in glitter (just kidding, there is no glitter)!

The ordering process is a little bit confusing if you aren't familiar, but the staff was super friendly and when I tried to order at the wrong window, the gentleman sent me to the right place.

I ordered an Al Pastor burrito for a coworker.  I thought $8.25 was a bit pricey, but she said that it was REALLY good, so I suppose it was worth it.  Everything is made to order - when building my burrito, the young lady asked if I preferred black beans or pintos, white rice or Spanish rice, etc.  It's like a truly authentic version of Chipotle, and with much better food.

For myself I ordered the chips and guacamole.  What a steal for $3.25 - they gave you a big thing of chips and I may have to say that this was he best guacamole I've ever had.  It was seriously so delicious! I shared with some coworkers who immediately wanted more.  The chips were also homemade (as they should be), and really awesome.

The cashier was very friendly and when I mentioned that the order was to-go, she gave me lids so I could take salsa with me.  The salsa bar had a great selection, with some hot sauces I had never even heard of!

I look forward to returning soon, so I can sit down and enjoy a meal in the restaurant.  They also have a bar, which is awesome!

I love a good taco shop, and this is no exception. Do yourself a favor and stop by if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Moondo the bartender is really cool guy. Went in this afternoon. Made us very at home. He is a very good bartender."}
{"text":"Dinner at Taco Y Taco tonight with my friend. I've been about 3 times, but her first. Food is fantastic, very authentic. I had a Barbacoa burritos and she had soft, open-faced tacos, and we shared chips and guacamole. She loved it! Great atmosphere, dining tables upstairs if you want more privacy. Also a full bar! Went on a Wednesday night and the place got busier and busier as the night went on.  One of my favorite places!  They also have entertainment on certain nights."}
{"text":"It's a little confusing when you enter the restaurant  to find how the ordering process works. We had someone cut us in line at the bowl/burrito ordering station bc the taco lines lead right up to it. I can see their lines getting unorganized during their busy times. 

Seating is first come first serve. Order your food at the counter, find a table and retrieve your own drinks and utensils. 

As I'm writing this, I am also thinking about how delicious their lengua tacos were and that I may go back again today. I also ordered their bowl with carne asada (guac is extra) and it lived up to my expectations. Best Mexican food I've found in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"I think I was hasty in my previous review. Ive had a change of heart. This is an astounding taco place! The food and service is always great :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good vegetarian options. But pretty pricey, have to spend like 18$ to get full at this place."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Reminded me of the street tacos in Cancun! I didn't give 5 stars because the bar  is so little.. with all the space you guys should really invest in a bigger bar area, my husband and I would have liked to have stayed and enjoyed ourselves a little while longer. Also the michelada was a little bland it tasted like regular modelo on tap with a hint of the michelada blend."}
{"text":"Their pork tacos are amazing ! The street tacos are small enough that you can try several different meats. They have an open salsa bar and full alcohol bar. Great little place for some awesome Mexican food !"}
{"text":"Such a great place to have some great taco's, a beer and enjoy the surroundings with live music. You have to try the El Pastor...YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Love Taco Y Taco. Prices super affordable and food so good. Last time we were here my friend said, \"this place just keeps getting better and better.\" I personally go for carne and Barbacoa tacos and my friend is obsessed with the mushroom taco. Tried half of one and can confirm it is also delicious. Love their extensive salsa bar which also includes free pinto or black beans. Great taco spot I keep craving."}
{"text":"Let's taco about how much I like this place.  It's nacho average mexican joint. 

Went on Sunday 3-20-16 at about 7pm cuz' I had a hankering for some al pastor tacos.  This restaurant is located on Tropicana & Pecos in the north-east corner in a small shopping center.  We probably come here about once a month or so.  It's my go-to place for \"authentic\" tacos. 

They have separate lines for each thing that you want.  My husband and I split up and I get the tacos and he stands in a line for the rest of the items.  

It was $13.25 for three al pastor tacos and two drinks.   They have a condiment bar with a lot of different salsas, radishes, picked carrots, fresh limes, black beans, pinto beans....but no cucumbers :( 

The guy making the al pastor tacos for me shaved off some meat from the spit, threw it on the grill for a bit, sprinkled a bit of juicy meat fats on it, then warmed up the fresh tortillas on the grill.  He shoveled all that porky goodness into the warm tortillas and topped it with cilantro (ewww), onions, a couple different sauces, and pineapple.  The pineapple is what takes it from yum to OMG.  

It's not particularly clean, it smells kinda funny inside, but DAYUMMMM can they make a good taco!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful tacos yummy yummy! Love the music and the fish tacos were the best I ever had in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Had 3 al pastor and a carne asada. So good. My wife had a bowl and it was huge. 2 servings easy. Best horchata I've ever had also. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"I was so excit d to try out this place... Cute inside and love their salsa bar but their food in my opinion doesn't live up to all the hype .. Paying 2.25 for el Pastor taco the size if my palm with about 3pieces of meat in it wasn't worth it in my opinion... Not bursting with flavor it's just average... Won't be back unfortunately:(  staff is friendly though and helpful and the place is clean ..three stars"}
{"text":"Delicious food, a bar and such a friendly staff! Can't wait to make this a regular Taco Tuesday spot!"}
{"text":"Just tried last week for the first time. Delicious carne asada tacos, very good chips and guacamole. Love the decor. The only thing I don't like are the various lines for ordering,  it's confusing and you end up standing around and then shuffling around other people who are in different lines, separated from your party and then you end up waiting again to pay. Kind of a cluster&$%@."}
{"text":"I lived in this area for many years until my husband and I moved to another side of town several months ago.  Taco Y Taco was one of our favorite spots to frequent, as it was close to home and we loved a lot of their menu offerings, especially the tacos.  It is my understanding that the family who owns and operates this restaurant was also in the butcher business, which makes sense... there was something different about the meat here.  It WAS good.

The other night, we happened to be  in our old stomping grounds and were too excited to have the tacos we missed so much.  But we were disappointed.  Not sure if it was just an off night, but the meat lacked flavor, and didn't have the nice charred flavor of a grill that we remembered.  It instead tasted steamed or boiled even.  

The place always seems unnecessarily chaotic, and we never minded it.  We can tolerate a less than stellar atmosphere if the food is great.  However, the fact that they missed the mark with our order had us wanting to leave quickly.  

Not sure if we will be back again."}
{"text":"I order a burrito, quesadilla, with meat and plain cheese it was delicious. The price is decent. Went around 11pm it was busy. Neat, clean."}
{"text":"First off, I came here three days in a row for lunch. They're not slow during this time but not particularly unbearable in terms of traffic. I got bowls and their $2.15 tacos. I gotta say, I'm not a fan of their Al Pastor but their Carnitas aren't too shabby. I prefer them over the al pastor. Between the two, I recommend trying the different tacos. $2.15 isn't too bad, for me, at least. :b

There are different stations. There's a bowl/burritos/everything else station and then there's stations for tacos so make sure you're aware of that. I was wondering why I didn't see plain ole tacos on the menu and then I actually noticed the tacos stations later, hah. *facepalm*

Their dining area is pretty spacious and right next to the drink station has all the sauces and lime and stuff. Also, beans, if you really want some more."}
{"text":"Deliciousness best tacos I have had this side of the border authentic taste and homemade tortillas great salsa. Great service very friendly and excellent food."}
{"text":"I consider myself a taco expert I've been eating tacos since I was 1 year old I grew up in Tijuana Mexico the taco mecca of the world my dad even own a taco shop at one point  I've live in Vegas for 12 years since day 1 I've always been looking for a good taco shop and I found it
TACO y TACO is the place I was looking for 
for authentic tacos."}
{"text":"What happened?
Tacos just to be so good right here and now there just like every other taco place or worse 

The meat is tasteless ( all meats)

I guess I have to look for a good taco place again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place.  This place could be a little confusing for first-timers.  There are several lines that you can order food from.  The menu is above the line you would wait to order your food.  The Al Pastor tacos are awesome!!! Order it with everything!!! It's the last line on the right-hand side. They cut the meat right from the rotisserie.  It's pork if you're wondering what it is. I'm not a huge pork eater but I promise you it'll be the best thing ever eaten."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but with integrity I can barely give this place 1 star. I got the vegetarian bowl and I must say the veggie meat was like hamburger helper mush. I'm not biased because my husband ordered a bowl also with meat and was equally dissatisfied! Sorry ambience was great food was horrible!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome.

Consistently the best 'street taco' meals we have had since leaving Los Angeles. The staff are genuinely friendly (they'll let you sample the whole damn menu), and they sell Mexican Coke...score.

If you're in a super-big hurry maybe go to TacoBell or something - this place is always busy, always fully-staffed...and usually a little slower than fast food. It's worth waiting for.

Hubby would walk a mile for the carnitas.
The Al Pastor and Asada are great, too.
And they do a bowl of mole fries that'll knock your socks off."}
{"text":"How does Taco y Taco only have 4 stars? This is hands down my favorite taco spot in Vegas. Even more than Tacos El Gordo, which is a controversial opinion among my friends and colleagues. Taco y Taco tacos use higher quality meat, and their tacos are way less greasy than Tacos El Gordo, which is delicious but I feel the regret with every bite. Their al pastor tacos are to die for, and I could probably eat 10 of them in one sitting. Mexican street corn is also delicious and they cover it in a generous amount of cheese. Another big win for Taco y Taco is its large salsa bar, which includes a few different options to make sure your tacos are topped exactly how you want them. Service has always been friendly and prompt and I've appreciated the short waits I've had every time I've gone to eat here. The space on Tropicana is also very large, so finding a table is never a problem. They also have a really large selection of drinks including beer, horchata and soda. Nothing could be better about Taco y Taco on Tropicana!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I went to the al pastor line. The guy was busy so I waited to for him to asked me what I wanted. Instead the teal led at me in front of every one. Come on dude!!! I was waiting for you to finished I did not wanted to interrupt. No way to treat a customer."}
{"text":"This place is great. Was a lil confused on the ordering style. But ended up getting a few tacos and a sope. Those were some of the best tacos I've ever had. You can taste the authentic mexican flavors deep within the meat. The dj was pretty cool. Will definitely be back and it's opposite from where I live."}
{"text":"First time going was last night. The chorizo taco I had was amazing. The bowl was amazing"}
{"text":"Great food and Excellent customer service.  Mundo is a great bartender and conversationalist. The staff is quick and ready to help."}
{"text":"I hated the experience. It is chaotic. There is no organization and you stand there trying to figure out where to go and where to pay. The food was ok at best and I don't understand the people who rave about it. If you want to feel panic go eat there."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this location. Parking lot always packed here. On the weekends they have live music so it's a cool place to go have tacos and beers with friends. The salsa bar is my favorite thing about this place. Mexican food is pretty much oily food so if you looking for healthy meal avoid meat and go with corn on Cobb or salad with salsa :) and they're offer seafood such as shrimp and white fish."}
{"text":"Always awesome finding a Mexican joint with vegetarian and vegan options.  The nopales burrito and the sourizo quesadilla were fantastic.  You can never go wrong with the elote!"}
{"text":"This place is great for vegetarians! My favorite was the mushroom one, but I tried them all except for the cactus one, and they were all good. The salsa bar was also amazing, I would highly recommend trying the green sauce !"}
{"text":"I really like the meat selection at taco y taco.   Surprisingly enough my favorite tacos are suadero, cabeza, and lengua and they do a pretty good job at making these meats.  The flavors are really great and shine through the fat (which I'll admit there is a lot of.)

I like the little salsa bar because I feel like I'm getting a good amount of other stuff for free.  There's not just salsa and pickled and roasted jalapenos but there are two kinds of beans (usually) as well.  The tacos themselves aren't that expensive starting at $2.25 for it's a very reasonable deal.

The one major major major gripe I have with this place is that I hate how you order especially if it's busy.  You stand in different lines for different kinds of tacos and then you stand in line to pay.  By the time you sit down your taco is cold and soggy. 

But they still get a 4 based on how tasty these tacos are and how much I like coming to this location (lots of seating and always clean. )"}
{"text":"Nice clean and great smiling service...had a family outing and loved that they had the space for 13 of us to sit together comfortably. Food was delicious and fast!"}
{"text":"The carne asada nachos were soooo good!! Only thing thats not good is the price of the beer!"}
{"text":"This place has the most awesome tacos, it was my first time going and I had a nice dinner, hope people come here, its the best! I hope to come again soon, its not too far from where I live :)"}
{"text":"It was alright, it felt like an over price robertos or a taco truck. Bland flavors didn't make up for the hefty price tag of each item. Was expecting more but still enjoyed it. One and done type of place for me and my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy. Tacos Al Pastor are the best thing there. Followed closely by something called a \"pompito\", it's not on the menu but is basically steak mashed between corn tortillas that have been fries with cheese on each side the guacamole and salsa. 

For the negative reviewers who's big complaint is they can't figure out how to order, buy mine and I'll meet you there and show you how to go through the line... Or just ask, they're very friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas! I had a chicken taco, a carnitas taco, and a pastor taco. All of these were arguably the best street tacos I've ever had! The salsa bar is not just loaded with amazing fresh salsas, limes, and radish like you would expect, but it also has fried jalapenos in two different types of hot beans which really allows you to make a meal of a few tacos. Don't forget about their burritos, salads, and the Mexican corn! Oh god the Mexican corn!"}
{"text":"Super tasty Mexican place. 

This is just like Tacos El Gordo, just more upscale. 

The reason why Im giving it a 4 star is 
1. Their system of ordering is time consuming
2. They are not always neat. They should have someone on the floor ensuring the restaurant is clean. 
3. Big 2 story restaurant yet, they dont always open 2nd floor so its crowded af in 1st floor. One job, only one job you have Taco y Taco. Tssss. 

PROS:

They have everything from tacos, nachos, bowls, sopes, & mulas (like a taco quesadilla, tortilla is thick, like a sope, greasy af but good af too) 

What I really love the most about this place is that they also have vegetarian options. Their is just so much variety. 

Prices are affordable. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"A solid five stars! The food is excellent, the staff was extremely helpful, knowledgable and fun to talk to. The bartender rocked with lots of different specialty drinks. Ask him about Bitters! This place is just an all around cool stop off. Only down is the ordering area and condiments bar is very close together and created a bottle neck."}
{"text":"The al pastor is where it's at! Tender, moist and a bit spicy! I had both an al pastor taco and vampiro, and both were delicious! This was my first ever vampiro and I'm definitely a fan. For those of you who've never had one, it's two cripsy tortillas with meat and melty cheese inside, almost like a sandwich. I also had a carnitas taco and the street style corn- both very good. The salsa bar was also great with lots of options. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed by my beloved taco y taco today. I frequent the original location on Tropicana, but this was my first visit to the new place. While the food is still 5 stars, management really needs to step it up on service and organization. 

I saw the advertisement on facebook about the buy 2 tacos get 1 free for Cinco de Mayo for both the 4th and 5th. The advertisement said for the Eastern location only so I thought it would be a perfect time to check out the new digs. When the girl at the register told me the price, I thought it was a little high and asked if she applied the deal. She informed me that the deal was only for the Tropicana location! I told her that's not what the ad said, and I guess a lot of people came in under the same assumption, but she was still not willing to apply the discount. As soon as I got home I checked out facebook again, and they recently posted a new ad listing the Tropicana location, and deleted the old one (clearly trying to cover their tracks). But those tricksters forgot to delete the twitter one that still said Eastern. Good try, but I caught you! Overall, things just aren't running as smoothly at this location as the original, but it's still early so I'll give them some time to work out the kinks.  But like I said, management really needs to get things in order. 

Despite my frustration, I can't deny the tacos. Between the 2 locations, I've tried the al pastor, lengua, tripas, carnitas and asada. The al pastor is definitely my favorite, followed by the carnitas and lengua. The asada is just ok, and the tripas was good but they didn't make it extra crispy as I requested. 

I'll be back, but I'll probably stick to the Tropicana location for a few more months and give the new place some more time to hopefully get things running more smoothly."}
{"text":"When you walk in it is very confusing.The cashier tells you to go to each sign to order.You must wait in line for pork taco.Very small open faced $2.50 per each.the go to next line for beef taco,than another line for corn on cob,vegs ect.....By the time you have gotten your last item your 1st items are cold....Than you have to go to salsa bar....They need a different plan.....We had 6 SMALL tacos 2 sodas $20.00....Also salsa bar not marked,mild?hot,ect.I guess you have to figure it out on your own.These are small street like tacos....Not worth $2.25 a piece....Taco El Gordo on the Strip charges $2.00 per taco......We won't be back......Not a fan of cafeteria style...."}
{"text":"This is by far the best taco place in Vegas.  My husband and I live 20 min away and we drive all the way here just for the food! Great salsas, choices, and atmosphere at both locations."}
{"text":"This is my fav mex food place in all of Las Vegas. It's a little pricey for tacos but totally worth it.  I just had a chicken burrito and I asked to have fried pork rinds in it.  Yumm-o!  My son also had a burrito but his was al pastor and looked fabulous.  It can be a bit intimidating ordering and the lines can be somewhat chaotic but totally worth the anxiety.  Highly recommend this delicious music filled taco place"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and have had a decent experience. My first thoughts is the ordering system is a bit wonky, hence the 3 stars. There's four different lines and it can get a bit convoluted. I stood in line 3 for some carne asada street tacos for quite a while before I was finally acknowledged. There were two guys manning all three lines which were long due to it being \"Taco Tuesday\". Once I got my tacos I went to the fourth line for some elote (which I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu). I was happy that I no longer have to go to north town to find the old lady pushing the grocery basket - that was a win! I also got the cilantro white rice as a side which was bland & not tasty. I ended up throwing it away. My husband had gone straight to the fourth line to get a burrito bowl with al pastor (which was awesome and hand carved which gave it a nice touch). The guy serving the fourth line was personable and cracking jokes - which helped break up the stress from the ordering process. 

Check out was easy and they have a huge self-service salsa bar which was well-maintained. Prices are decent...$2.25 per taco and $3 for the elote. They do have a taco happy hour as well. There's a soda machine and a full service bar. Seating is available both upstairs and downstairs and they have a patio for when the weather is nice. 

Overall good tacos, great tasting meat, frustrating ordering process. We'll be back though to give it another go."}
{"text":"Just when I gave up hope for any good Mexican food or tacos in vegas, Taco y Taco saved my day. Or possibly, my life. 

Since Tacos el Gordo (one of the most popular) was a disappointment for me, I had given up half a year ago. IT's been a while, yeah. 

I think this place has hands down the BEST Al Pastor Tacos. OH MY GOSH. I don't even really like Al pastor tacos, and prefer carne asada, but it was a smashing hit for me here, surpassing the other tacos available. 

Al pastor tacos- 7/5 stars. 
Carne asada tacos- 4/5 stars. 
Shrimp tacos- 5/5 stars. 
Mexican hot cocoa- 2/5 stars. It was chunky, had strange bits in it, and it tasted almost like they used lard or a different type of fat instead of milk.

This place will be my go-to tacos spot in vegas until I find something better."}
{"text":"Service was great and so was the food, i heard about this place from many people in my classes at UNLV, lived up to my expectations. loved the tacos!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! Service is AWESOME, workers are cool, they even do little tricks here and there, they have a great sense of humor. The food taste authentic and definitely satisfies my craving for REAL Hispanic food. P.s. Best horchata  and street style corn I've ever had! So delicious and flavorful."}
{"text":"Food is good, pricing is a little too high for me. 4 tacos de asada y una bebida por $12.  The service is alright but you basically have to hop in line at a station and order what you want."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  One time my friend ate the cashiers quesadilla and we all laughed about it.  I go all the time and have never had an experience that was less than delicious."}
{"text":"So far the best taco place in town, they have an amazing  staff... it feels like home ."}
{"text":"Awesome place to try out! I was slightly overwhelmed when I walked in because of the cafeteria style line, but next one will be prepared. I had the muleta, vampiro, street corn, and chips and guac and they were all excellent! I was surprised by the format in this building because I had been to republics which it was previously. It ended up being a great change of pace and the food was great. A fun group outing as well."}
{"text":"The food is better than any average Mexican food joint in Las Vegas but at the same time I do think the food is slightly over priced and it was disappointing that the person making my burrito remembered to tell the cashier to charge for guacamole but he himself didn't remember to put it in. It's a little hard to communicate with the workers there since they don't really speak English well and whenever you want to ask them a question they only say no or yes when I specifically asked what kind of cheese they have, twice. 

But don't get me wrong, the food is better than the average so just try it. I ordered a burrito with guac and extra meat and it came out to 15-17 dollars. I, myself, didn't think it was worth it since it was a rather small burrito, smaller than a 6 dollar burrito you can get at robertos."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!! Vampiro tacos are bomb. Love tells fish , shrimp and vegan option. So so good."}
{"text":"The el pastor vampiro's might be one of my favorite things to eat here ever!

If you are with out the kids, try to grab a seat at their bar. The two guys that work on Saturday nights really have some great recommendations and can whip up a mean cocktail!! Be patient, their master pieces need a little time since they actually muddle real fruit and mix their own seasonings."}
{"text":"Food here is truly amazing! Low prices, nice set up with seating down stairs and up stairs, quick service, this place is always busy for lunch and dinner, lines can get alittle confusing"}
{"text":"Very good taco restaurant! They don't over season the meat and they have different stations depending on what you would like. Tons of variety! We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is subpar. But really this is about service. I came in on a Friday when they were kind of busy. Keep in mind they have separate lines for different things that you want. 

I ordered my al pastor tacos.. Then proceeded to the corn line.. This line was the longest. I was in line for 15 minutes, and then was told they had no corn. MAYBE PUT UP A SIGN?! Then proceeded to the line to pay.. Waited another 15 minutes.. Because only one register was being manned while employees were standing right there goofing around. 

Got to paying.. AFTER almost 30 minutes ! My tacos got cold.. So I asked for fresh ones.. And the manager or supervisor or whoever he was proceeded to tell me, that I shouldn't have done that and that next time I should have multiple people stand in lines, so food doesn't get cold.. LOL what a joke. All the employees gave me a look and I felt uncomfortable. CARLOS, the man cooking the Al Pastor meat, was very rude saying \"This is the only time we're doing this.. And don't expect it again.\" 
They need to be more organized because the ordering process is ridiculous.. 
WILL NEVER BE EATING HERE AGAIN AND WILL BE CONTACTING MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review. I've been here a few times after my first experience. I will say their turn around rate is very high. Always different people when I come in here. Even with supervised training, there are mistakes. I'm not sure where the disconnect is but there's just not good customer service here. Not coming back here. Not to mention the seating area is always trashed. No one ever smiles, doesn't feel good to be here."}
{"text":"Me. Hi I will take a vegetable bowl.
Them. What kind of meat 
Me. Just vegetables please 
Them ok
At register - they ring me up for extra charge of guacamole (a vegetable) 
Me. It is a vegetable bowl - never charged me before
Them. Well it is extra
Me. Ok last time I will eat here

Are you kidding me???? Extra for wanting vegetables only! Rip off!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Greatest hidden Gem in Vegas! Awesome service and authentic food! Try the Corn.....OMG! The menu is a little confusing but they are willing to help you order. The Salsa bar is amazing as well. The only criticism I would give is they need Queso and chips. So, if your reading.....bring the Queso!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my sisters birthday. This location is much nicer than the one on Trop, to host a party for a larger group. 

This particular night we got the whole up stairs to ourselves and it was amazing! 
On one tab, we were able to get whatever we wanted 

The food was great! Very authentic! But not like tacos on the street authentic. 
CLEAN, authentic, modern... Need I say more ?! 

Their set up reminds me of Tacos El Gordo. 
You go straight up to the area of where you'd like something from and order right there!

The best part is that since I'm Vegetarian and most of the group isn't, there was STILL plenty of variety for both: meat-eaters & non-meat-eaters alike! (This of course was my favorite part)

Also, you've got so many toppings and salsas to choose from as well. This made building the Tacos extra fun 

Aside from the food, the place is really nice inside and out. The ordering area where the food is at, the bar area, upstairs, the patio and the bathrooms. Everything was kept up with and running smoothly. 

I'd absolutely come back again, especially for a bigger group!

Thanks Taco y Taco for a great night! 
Your restaurant is appreciated"}
{"text":"When this place opened, I just had to try it. They've really expanded their menu since then and it reminds me a lot of Chipotle, but more authentic. They're a little bit pricey, and it's kind of hard to order because it's so loud in there. It's also a little bit confusing to order. I prefer other taco shops, more authentic and cheaper."}
{"text":"Ordered party trays and elotes for work function and service was extremely slow even though I ordered 3 days in advance. Overall food was good but the corn was over cooked and the carne Asada was dry with little to no seasoning. Maybe will try again if I eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for just a snack and ordered two chicken tacos. They were good but a lil too pricey for street tacos."}
{"text":"This place has some delicious tacos and burritos. It is a little above average as far a pricing but you are playing for  he quality which is great !"}
{"text":"Just an ok place. Ordering system is kinda weird and annoying. Food was good but not great and over priced."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on yelp. I made it a mission to come here with my toddler and a mission it was. This place is pretty big on seatings (lots of tables and chairs), I believe there might have been an upstairs as well,  but i am not sure ( didnt have time to explore) I did see someone coming downstair with their child, so I am not sure if it was an employee. This place is pretty loud and i am not sure what mind of music was playing (not a good place to have conversations). But it had a pretty fast beat to it.  At times I felt like I wanted to throw my taco on the floor and just dance (should be called Club Taco y Taco). But at $2.25 each, I decided it be best to just devour it instead. Now upond arrival, I was a bit confused. I didnt inderstand the concept of ordering, they have three different lines set up at the taco side, you pretty much wait in each line, depending on your choice of meat to order your taco. So yeah, that was a bummer we had to wait in two lines and wait an again at the bar to order our nachos. So if this place is packed, you will be waiting for a good amount of time. Now on to the meats, I ordered carne asada and carnitas. I basically was not impressed, I ve had better street tacos at hole in the wall places. But at least the tomatillo salsa was able to redeemed it in the  flavor catergory. 
Overall the only thing I was impressed with was the homemade tortillas, (the kind abuela made with masa) i could literally eat these tortillas all day. 
So if you dont mind waiting then this place might be for you, if your okay with bland meat then this is your place.
I might have to give this place another chance.  just to try out there fish tacos and take some homade tortillas home."}
{"text":"I've always driven passed their sign but finally got to try them out! Don't let the outside fool you, it's pretty spacious and clean on the inside. 

I like to get the al pastor tacos, for $2.25 each you can't go wrong. It's freshly cut off of a spinning bar. I like to add extra pineapples to mine and squeeze some limes for extra taste. 

You order first and then pay. Weird system but somehow it works. Whenever I'm craving tacos I usually think about taco y taco. 

Next time I gotta try their elote!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I have had Taco Y Taco bookmarked for quite a while and finally had time to go today for lunch. It was not crowded at all and after telling the cashier it was our first time she was happy to explain how the ordering worked. I knew I wanted the al pastor (roasted pork) after reading all of the great reviews. As others have mentioned it is sliced right in front of you on a spit, just like gyro meat.  

Stepping up to to the line #2 I was greeted by two very friendly employees. I ordered 2 gran tacos al pastor. The gran tacos come with 2 soft corn tortillas that have melted monterey jack cheese between them, then the al pastor, black beans, pico, avocado and sour cream. Aboslutely delicious! It was definately one of the best tacos I have ever eaten.

We also ordered a side of chips and guac which at $3.75 was a steal. These are real chips, you can tell made in house and guac was delicious. While waiting for our food we hit the amazing salsa bar. It has everything you can imagine! 8 different salsa's, fresh limes, radishes, pickled carrots and peppers and grilled onions & peppers. The grilled onions were so sweet and yummy. 

The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I even got a \"thank you\" when I put a tip in the tip jar which is nice. I am definately returning to try the mole fries and the grilled cactus. Thank you Taco Y Taco for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"If you love Chipotle and love almost authentic Hispanic food, then this is the place for you.

So I wanted to give this place a two because I read the reviews and was excited to try the place. I drive past it daily on my commute to and from work, so it was inevitable that I would try this place.

What anyone failed to me is that is a Mexican version of chipotle. So I am telling you. Yes, they have a salsa bar, yes they have more meat options. 

I tried the al pastor bowl and it was decent. I was slightly disappointed because it had mozzarella cheese instead of authentic Mexican cheese. 

We also tried a chicken burrito and it was good, solid eats. But nothing to rave about.

If you are in the mood for Mexican, then definitely try this place out. You just might love it. I just expected something else.

I probably would have been better off if I stuck with the tacos. I would go back just to try that but not sure anything else."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN, Best Al Pastor Tacos out there. Even better than al pastor tacos that I had in D.F. Also elote is super fresh. Bomb.   I personally like visiting the og location on Tropicana for its authentic vibes, but for a more upbeat environment, the one on Eastern is perfect."}
{"text":"Really swanky setup. Staff were pleasant. I wanted Barbadian but they didn't have any, so I got chicken instead. It was ok. I also had a horchata which was really sweet, but hit the spot. This was better than other Mexican spots in the area, so I would most likely return."}
{"text":"Came here this evening for the first time for their 3 year anniversary dollar taco promo. Thanks Chris V for helping spreading the news via social media.  

The restaurant was poppin!  How poppin was it?  We accidentally came in from the dining room area, saw the balloons at each table and the mariachi band performing before noticing this was the back end of the restaurant.  So we walked towards the line of people patiently waiting their turn to just order trying to find the end, and literally had to walk out the front door to wait behind a few customers that were out there at the official end of the line. That poppin!  By the time we got to the lines to order the tacos, it was almost 50 minutes later.  But the tacos were great, they didn't skimp or make it smaller, just So crazy packed and wildly successful!

I have to say that due to the massive crowd of customers that came out for $1 beer and tacos, if you were not already a pro at ordering different tacos at different stations, the ordering system can and was definitely confusing and frustrating for me.  A slip of paper to mark down what you want to order, so you can get exactly what you want without having to go wait in the back of the long line again to complete your order would have been helpful, especially on days of their super promotions.

But the tacos were tasty. Fair amount of protein on each one. I initially wanted 12 tacos, but only ended up order 7 and a Horchata, and I was full.  And the staff worked their butt off trying to make the fresh tortillas, cooking and grilling the meat fresh, and expertly assembling each tacos to order. Everyone in line can see how hard they worked and not a single person complained about the wait. 

The Al Pastor (Spicy Pork) is noticeably spicier than the other places, but so good. Maybe I was closer to feeling famished after an hour of waiting in line, or their grilled chicken tacos was just that good, but 3 of them quickly disappeared after I squeezed some fresh lime juice on it. 

Good food, good prices (even without their anniversary or National Taco Day promotion) and I know I will be making another trip to the other side of Las Vegas soon for some more great street tacos."}
{"text":"Loved the Mulas here!! Food was fresh & Salsa's were tasty! As close as Tijuana Mexico tacos I have tasted in the US! Highly recommend!  
Horchata was bomb also! 

Update- took my Husband he was not too impressed with the adobada mula, he should have asked for NO pineapple on it! (Who wants pineapple in their taco anyway!)  but he did agree that the carne asada mula was  really tasty! The chorizo one was not too good :("}
{"text":"For those not in the know, I'm a bit of a taco lover, so of course taco taco is a place I found myself attracted to. The setup is pretty straightforward, there's the taco lines, depending in what meat you want, and then there's the side where you order grande tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Ive never been tempted to try the burritos here, but I have gone thru the entire meat spectrum  their strong points are suadero and al pastor, and I felt their cabeza was a bit lacking. Their carnitas was a very welcome surprise due to the fact that there are a lot of places that don't do it right.   The dining room is pretty spacious if you're choosing to eat in, they have a TV. It's nothing special but it's great if you have a nice group of friends and you guys are just hanging out. 
Overall it's a nice taco shop with good food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I like this place... for multiple reasons. 

Lively and trendy(without being hipster thank god). Reasonable prices($2.25 a taco--the extra change I'm not used to I'll chalk up to the ambiance and alcohol). Having a DJ on the weekends are cool if you want to hang out. Multiple TV's to watch sports are always a plus. Quick service. GREAT salsa bar. Can do small parties upstairs.

Last time I was here they accidentally gave my chicken nachos instead of carne asada.. The guy asked if we didn't mind just piling on the proper meat instead of remaking it. Haaaayyyyy.. the more the merrier. 

Only qualms so far: 
1. They ran out of limes and served lemons(umm.. what?)
2. Not a fan of their house ale.. but to each their own."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, taco joints are abundant so you can say I've tried my fair share of tacos. I tried this place expecting it to blow my taste buds. At best, it tastes O-K. Nothing to drive all the way out for, nothing to wait in line for and nothing to really get excited about. It doesn't come close to Gordo's. Their hibiscus drink however was very good! We ended up making an Armando Palmero mixing half of hibiscus and the lemonade."}
{"text":"I went during a slow time so ordering wasn't terrible, but I can see how it would be annoying if it was packed. I ordered a shrimp taco and a chicken taco. In my opinion they were okay. Not great, not bad. I've had much better authentic tacos out here. I doubt I'll be back... I was just a little underwhelmed with all the hype. :("}
{"text":"The tacos are too oily asada was the only thing I liked the rest of the tacos were too too oily orchat was hot the salsas are good. It's a copycat of Tacos el Gordo but el Gordo is way way better then this place in my opinion"}
{"text":"Favorite things to order: mushroom & soyrizo tacos, elote (street corn), and horchata!

I love hip places that have a variety of vegetarian/vegan options. These tacos are so yummy. The mushroom ones come with cheese and grilled mushrooms and have these savory greasy (in a good way!) flavor and sauce that runs out when your eating. 

The soyrizo is spicy and \"meaty\" and you can add whatever other toppings to make it how you like. 
The avocado sauce at the free salsa it creamy and tops off the spicy dishes. 

The corn here is the best I've ever had, no nonsense and just done right. Same goes for the horchata which is creamy and sweet and tastes homemade not like the bottled version you can get at other places."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican food place.!!!

After going the first time and being confused with the way you order this in the different areas, we go there at least once a week. I haven't had a bad experienced yet. 

Food is always amazing. I could live off their elote. The carne Asada is delicious and thinly cut. The al pastor was a switch up for me and it was literally amazing. I don't normally like spicy food but I will suck it up for anything they have there. My husband and I fight over the carne Asada fries or nachos. 

I love the decor. The white brick the tin ceiling, it's all amazing. I love that they have upstairs seating, especially now having a baby it makes dining easier I can just go up there and not worry the baby will ruin others dining experience if she cries. 

It's usually a go to even when everyone's drunk and a much more satisfying option than Roberto's."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. 

Super great location, a mile from our house. I love that they have a full, and I do mean FULL, bar. Their tequila selection is impressive, to say the least!! Our bar tender, Jose, was incredible! Very attentive, gave us all kinds of samples, really friendly!! Their food, also incredible!! We tried the al pastor taco (meat, onions, cilantro and pineapple)...not a huge pork fan, but it was super tasty! Also tried one of their carne Asada bowls, yummy!! The one downside of the bowl was the cheese. It was pretty much the Kraft shredded fiesta mix you can buy at the grocery store. The carne Asada was great though!! Not fatty and very flavorful. My girlfriend got the chips and guacamole. Not a huge fan myself, but was definitely impressed. The guacamole was filled with cilantro and chunks of tomato. The chips were homemade and warm when they came out.

Overall, was very impressed and can't wait to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great hang out for friends or large groups. Authentic Mexican food. I had a carne asada burrito with everything except rice, so delicious. The meat was grilled and not boiled like many other Mexican fast food places. I will be coming here again soon. The jimica was fresh and not watered down either. A must try new restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Even though they are on the other side of town from where I live, I find myself driving across town to eat here. It is one of my favorite taco places in Las Vegas. I strongly recommend the el pastor! The corn is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Been hearing ads on the radio for this place for the last few months and finally got around to getting there this weekend.  I was expecting a small hole in the wall of a restaurant, but it is a very nice building in a strip mall.  Very nice and clean place.

Now on to the food.  It's great.  I had the carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas taco and they were great.  My friend tried the tripas, chicharron, and not sure what the third taco was.  The chicharron taco was good, but very spicy, so spicy he was sweating.  The horchata is some of the best I have ever had, nice and creamy and not too sweet.  Good selections on salsas and beers on tap.  

After reading some other reviews, there is no way I'd rather eat at Chipotle than Taco y Taco.  A note on the lines.  There are 3 lines in the back and they are clearly marked as to what meats you can order in each line.  I have been to other taquerias that have the same set up, and I have never found it confusing but that's just me.  Just look at the monitors above the counters and see what meat is served in that line and move from line to line if you want different items.  

Be definitely coming back again for more."}
{"text":"My favorite Taco joint in town. $2.25 all day every day. All house butchered meats from los compadres. Fresh, fresh and fresh. Great service and I've not been let down yet. Come by and try them out. Can't beat a two buck chuck."}
{"text":"I was already in love with the food from Taco Y Taco, I didn't think it could get any better. With the addition if this new location, they proved me wrong. It's definitely better. Same great food, but add a bar and a snazzy interior, this location is a whole new experience. 

The restaurant is the same set up as the original location. Ordering stations based on the type of meat you will be ordering. They have the same great salsa bar and menu items, so I'm excited. The al pastor is still my favorite but I have to branch out next time. Elote is also a must. 

If only they would open a location on my side of town, but until then I will be making the drive to their Trop and Eastern locations in the time being."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout to try one of my bookmarked spots for lunch and I decided to give this place a try when I was having a major elote craving. 

I arrived around 12:30 and the place was pretty busy but not too packed. I decided on some Mexican corn and two tacos al pastor. Everything looked really fresh and handmade and it all smelled so good. While I was paying I chatted with the cashier who asked how I heard about them. I told her about Yelp and she was glad the word was spreading about them so well. All the employees were really nice and friendly. Before I left with my goodies I had to stop at the famous salsa bar to get some delicious toppings. They really keep everything very clean, which makes me happy and they have so many salsa options which is nice. They have a really and clean dining area and everything is super cheap.

I enjoyed my tacos right away and they were amazing! Some of the best I've ever had. They were so juicy and had amazing flavor. I was absolutely in love after the first bite and it just got better and better as I ate. I finished my two tacos and was sad that they were over. On to my corn. This was really great. Very typical Mexican corn. I liked that they kept it a little more on the crunchy side, which I prefer. 

Everything here was fabulous and I am already planning my return really soon!"}
{"text":"Eh this place is ok. Good margaritas. Both times I've come super long wait for seafood. I finally got the shrimp tacos and the shrimp was not cooked. Slimy.  I also tasted the chicken and the meat was bad. Turned me off so I got a veggie quesadilla was ok. 1 star for food, 4 for service. They need to come up with a better plan here and the fact you have to buy a while box of chips when I only want one serving. Like 5 bucks. Come on ridiculous and the fact they charged me after I wasn't even going to eat was a little annoying(for the chips)i mean come on i came for dinner right after The gym. I needed protein. The bartender was rude but the lady handling the register was super nice. Thanks probably won't be back. 3rd time trying them out. Hey I gave it a chance"}
{"text":"What a fabulous find, and in a section of town that sorely needs new and delicious food! I heard about this place just recently, and went today.  The place is huge! The menu is smaller than average, but there are several protein and salsa choices! 

I had the vegetarian soy chorizo and it was terrific! Guacamole was very flavorful, amazing and fresh. Even though I didn't try it, the roasted corn looked great- next time. I'd post a photo, but I was too excited to eat everything before I thought to take a picture :)"}
{"text":"First of all, they were really close to getting a  fourth star from me but I just couldn't do it. The tacos were delicious, but I'm an atmosphere and experience person and those just did not deliver for me. 

Food: I got the Gran Tacos with no meat. Vegetarian options here are great (soyrizo, sautéed mushrooms), but I wasn't feeling super adventurous at the time. The salsa was my favorite. Not too spicy, but super flavorful. I also had black beans, cheese, and guacamole on mine, and they really were excellent. They melt the cheese right on the tortilla, and then you can get more on top. My friend got the Mexican street style corn on the cob, which was amazing. Definitely will go back for that alone.

Atmosphere: I feel like the layout is all wrong, almost backwards or something. They explain to you the different lines that are available for different items that you order, but the area isn't big enough and the lines sort of all run together, and I witnessed multiple people think they were being cut in line, and wonder what the hell was going on. Not to mention the burrito/bowl/fries line runs the other way, right into the street taco line.. Not laid out very well at all. The topping bar is also kind of in the way of these lines. Not sure how that will work during a big lunch rush...

If customers can get past the clusterfuck of a layout, taco y taco will be successful. But if customers get frustrated/confused like we were today, they could easily walk out and go to any other restaurant in the plaza. I know it's a brand new place so maybe they are still just working out the kinks! (I hope!)"}
{"text":"Food is always good here. They also offer a variety of amazing tequilas and a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"3 cheers for happy hour pricing on beers! 

Like many others have said, this restaurant is set up like a fancy Tacos el Gordo. Except the patrons and ambiance are a lot more wannabe hipster and lot less Mexican. 

The food is good. Flavorful, if a little bit on the saucy / soggy side. The Mexican street corn is really delicious and they really don't skimp on the meat and cheese on the carne asada fries. 

My main dislike is how freaking loud it is in here. During happy hour they have a live DJ, which is fine because it's like, \"whoo party tiiime,\" but even during regular hours they BLAST the club music. It is unnecessary for the music to be so loud, and it distracts from the food and conversation. 

My second dislike is sort of related to the set up. I understand they're trying to do it like tacos el gordo with separate meat stations, and that works only if they move FAST and at similar speeds. However, the burrito / fish & shrimp taco / fries, nachos & corn station is significantly slower than the meat stations. That means that if you want carne asada fries AND an al pastor taco, even if you order the fries first, go order the al pastor taco, and come back for the fries, by the time the fries come out your taco is cold. Even if you order carne asada fries and a shrimp taco (same station), they come out so far apart from each other that one is inevitably cold and soggy by the time the other comes out. So the only way to have all hot items is to order only meat items and no sides.

Update:
They are obsessed with the vampiro right now. My friend ordered an al pastor taco, out came a vampiro. I ordered 1 pibil taco and 1 chicharron taco, out came 1 taco and 1 vampiro...."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing! Even though the ordering process was a little confusing. I didn't however appreciate the fact that the staff doesn't really engage with their clientele. I was waiting a whole 8 mins with no one else behind me before I had to approach the gentlemen to order. But he was respectful after I got his attention."}
{"text":"If you have not tried Mexican corn.. You just have to! It's so good! I'm not sure if they give you the cup option here, but you can use a knife anyway and cut it. 

I have been here several times and the food was not too bad. There are different lines for different meats, but the wait isn't ever too long unless there's a special going on.

The service is not the best though. When I walk to place an order, most of the time the staff seems to not want it to bother them. There were no smiles or greetings when it was time to pay, I was the last in line."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't have the 4 star experience I was expecting based on the reviews I read. That being said, I don't see what the hype is all about. I think people may have quantity confused with quality, because variety is just about the only thing this place has to offer. The line system was non-existent and employees walked around sweeping, yet didn't offer help to new customers that were clearly clueless. The music (techno & house) was blaring and not at all in tune with the supposed authentic Mexican experience the numerous signs claim you are said to encounter. And then there's the food, which was really just...blah. All in all it was a huge dissapointment unworthy of a follow up visit, which is a bummer because I'd been looking forward to eating here for quite some time."}
{"text":"I used to love this place for the food, the enthusiastic employees and the overall cleanliness. As I've been coming recently though, it has been declining in service and cleanliness. I have to ask the employees for a rag to wipe my own table if I care to dine in. The employees are less enthusiastic about their job and dont bother to suggest any items or help stock the salsa bar. 
I think I will start to not refer anyone here or just stop coming here all together..."}
{"text":"Food is over priced , menu is confusing , they charge you for chips and salsa , zero customer service , the reality of it is this is an overpriced taqueria . The atmosphere is blah , had to check it out because I love Mexican food but def won't be going back"}
