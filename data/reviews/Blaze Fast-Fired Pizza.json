{"text":"Very disappointing, you would think pizza cooked in a flame oven at several hundred degrees would be crispy right? Wrong, pick it up and watch it flop. Far from what I what call \"good\" pizza. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Went there this weekend and was less than impressed. Food was overpriced and the music was very loud. The drinks tasted watered down. The pizza itself was just okay nothing special. We ordered two specialty pizzas and one simple pie. I have to say out of all of them the only one I would order again is the simple pie! Pizza Fire is far superior to Blaze."}
{"text":"We have tried the other two fast-fired pizza chains in the west valley. Even though they are all identical in concept, in our opinion Blaze is by far the best of them. Their spicy red sauce actually IS spicy, & it's also a lot thicker than the other chains' red sauces. It really made the pizza much more flavorful. They are also very generous with their toppings when you ask for extra. The cheese was good & not greasy, & the crust was very tasty. If you use their app for ordering, you can earn one Flame per pizza & 10 pies get you a free one. Who doesn't appreciate a loyalty program?"}
{"text":"Got there at 11:35 p.m. and was greeted by a very eager helpful staff. Explained everything really well, made pizza quickly and we got them within 5 to 8 minutes start to finish. This is a thin crust pizza fresh ingredients totally customizable. Nice addition to the mentor area! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My daughter and three children ate at Blaze yesterday..we will not go back..our experience was awful...first off the music is SO loud and the accustics are horrible..the counter workers had to yell so we could hear. The children we had with us, ages 6,7 and 8 were pressured to give their requests and pushed along the line..they didn't understand what sauce or cheese to order..they wanted a pizza!  When we reached our table, there was no small talk, to noisey and yelling was not an option..we didn't want the table beside us to hear our conversation..the kids liked their pizza, the adults didn't.  The adults had a salad also that was fair...Bottom line we felt like cattle being prodded along and the whole experience as I said was awful.  I'm sure we won't be back."}
{"text":"Being the 'pizza freak' that I am, there's no doubt in my mind that Pizza Roto in Madison is much better. I would seriously drive to Madison before going back to Blaze."}
{"text":"Not good. Music too loud, slow lines, no choice of what you want on the salads, BURNT PIZZA, and jeez, when you hand out the pizza put it on something other than a scorching hot pan. I almost dropped the pizza as it was so hot. I like the place in Madison much better. Friendlier staff too.   Hopefully they can run this place right as another abandoned shop in mentor is not what we need."}
{"text":"FAST and delicious, personal, oven-baked pizzas with your choice of  toppings for a super affordable price! 

Blaze's unlimited pizza options, and 40+ fresh ingredients make for a new (and delicious) experience every time! And it helps that the staff members are super patient (because I can never decide what I want on my pizza...) and they're all very enthusiastic and seem genuinely happy to work there. The restaurant itself is clean and modern but it's pretty small (there are probably 10 tables) with the addition of outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Walked in with no real expectations, I redeemed our free pizza voucher & ordered a second pizza. pepperoni for the kids & the BBQ chicken on the high-rise dough for the wife & myself. While the gentleman that was making my first pizza I asked if I could change my order and instead the get Red Vine instead. Since it wasn't made yet it was no big deal & the gentleman gladly changed my order. We took them home & both tasted pretty good; nothing spectacular, but it wasn't terrible. I am a fan of the classic red sauce, not too garlicky or spicy. We'll probably go back & try it again and see what the other pizza's taste like. For the price you really can't beat it. Granted I went around 4 PM so I can't speak for dinner rushes or weekends, but it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and baked to perfection! Love the char marks on the crust. The toppings were fresh and the red sauce (usually nothing to comment about at other places) was actually flavorful! The ricotta cheese was soooo creamy and delicious. I would definitely recommend this location, as it's not extremely busy as of yet!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. I like it way better than MOD pizza. l got the Link in minus the onions green and red bell peppers, delicious. My husband gets the meat lovers and that one is pretty tasty.  Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed depending the time of day your order pizza determine? how burnt the bottom gets. Not my favorite kind of pizza place buy they do have several options for pizza."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Great sauce with a bit of spice. Fresh cheese, crust is just a tad thicker than thin crust and crispy!

You order your individual pizza with whatever toppings you want and wait just a few minutes for your hot out of the oven pizza.

Right after we ordered the line went out the door so it was kind of loud the rest of our time here and it's not that big of a place.

So overall, tasty sauce with a great crispy crust and plenty of toppings.  This will definitely be a go to pizza place for me."}
{"text":"I would have to say my blaze pizza is one the better pizza places of this style I had the veggie  Good amount of veggies on it I did like the sauce it was a little sweet very well balance I  Wish I woulda had them cook the pizza more cause it was a little under cook but over all pretty good The people behind the counter were great was able to explain things very easily over a pretty good experience with deafening go back and I think I'm Monday's it's cheaper"}
{"text":"My wife and stopped here for some gluten free pizza.  We ordered a sausage, meatball and pepperoni gluten free pizza. This a thin crust pizza.  I didn't see any pepperoni or meatball on the pizza.
The pizza was made quickly and was good for a gluten free pizza.  There were no plates available, only brown napkins.  This is a bare bones pizzeria.  It is not bad, but I wouldn't rate it as a just go to restaurant.  
We didn't order anything to drink either, although from my quick review of their offerings, I would not have gotten anything.
We tried there pizza, and I don't think I will be going back there anytime soon.
You get what you pay for.  The pizza was inexpensive and good, although not what we ordered. 
If you want an inexpensive no frills pizza, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Here 15 minutes before close, but the fire is still going and Adrienne made me 2 pizzas to go with a smile. Thanks for taking care of this night owl."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Saturday for lunch. Their Pizza's tasted fresh and on point. Very tasty. I was very impressed when I saw them make my crust right in front of me. The service at Blaze was also a pleasant surprize. SUPER DUPER nice and friendly, very clean restaurant, & great pizza. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tasty pizzas. Very quick and made to order. Think of it like a sub shop where you build your order. Same thing here. Very cool."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and it was packed, expected it to be, so we thought it would be worth waiting in line for, until the one of the workers asked us to stand outside, yeah that wasn't going to happen with 3 kids and     about 105 outside, it was manageable inside, people were able to navigate to where they wanted to get too, do you ever see any other places where they make you wait in line OUTSIDE, yeah it can't be that good to stand in the heat for!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Blaze for the first time. Staff was helpful and fully explained the pizza options. Pizzas are a good size with plenty of topping options for the price. Tradition soft drinks are available, but the Aqua Fresica drink options were a pleasant surprise.  We will surely be back."}
{"text":"Not the greatest pizza. Really no good taste to the pizza . The wait time for ordering is ridiculous. The wait time for the cooked pizza is twice as ridiculous. Been there twice. They were out of salads & the pop machine both times were out of Diet Coke.  Just doesn't seem very organized. Some staff aren't the brightest , & very slow. Heard this was LeBron James' baby, kinda wonder if he even knows what's going on. It's back to Madison's Roto Pizza, Rt I90 & Rt 528 for better pizza."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and they weren't very busy. We stood for several minutes while the staff just joked around and had no sense of urgency to even help anyone.  A lot of the toppings were not filled and looked old. The pizza was pretty average for the price. Not worth coming back for. 

What really makes us not willing to come back is the attitude of the employees and watching them just joke around and laugh with each other instead of helping people or acting like they cared. The giant garbage can in the corner was overflowing and mounded with garbage as the employees did nothing. 

The employees will have this place out of business within a year!"}
{"text":"Sold burned black bottom cheese pizza for our child.  We didn't notice until we got home. No way you could not see the bottom was totally black on the bottom. What a lazy service attitude employees must have to think it is acceptable to serve and charge customers for black bottom pizza.  Shouldn't employees notice this kind of thing? How many black burnt bottom pizzas are served daily? Thank you Blaze employees for letting us waste money on an inedible pile of burnt food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pizza to go this weekend and we're pleasantly surprised by how amazing the thin crust pizza was. The owners were extremely friendly and the food was amazing.  Maybe the best Pizza in the area that we've found and the nicest management around."}
{"text":"The bottom of my cheese pizza was burned  pretty bad and was all I could taste. Service was good besides that."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out, and finally got the chance to stop by with a friend tonight. We decided to opt for the build your own pizza option. Note: the pizzas are intended for one individual, however they are 12' in size and big enough for two people to share. The pizza toppings are all fresh and the price of the pizza was as reasonable as it gets for a fast food pizza joint (About $8 for a specialty pizza). 

The only thing I was less than impressed by was the salad, we decided to share a ceaser salad and it tasted a bit outdated. The croutons were challenging to bite into, and the lettuce overall seemed drier than expected (we did not end up finishing it). 

Otherwise, would definitely come here again! Make sure to try the strawberry agua fresca, it was really refreshing."}
{"text":"Service is terrible and very very very painfully SLOW.  Not organized at all. They need to hire and train a better staff team if they are going to survive in this location. Do not come here if you are on a lunch hour."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant via Yelp - excellent discovery! This restaurant is a part of a chain started in California in 2012 AD. As of this writing they are expanding rapidly; they have over 200 locations.

The concept is quite similar to MOD Pizza, except, they don't serve beer and they have three different crusts you can choose from. We ordered the thin crust and it was perfect!

The inside of the restaurant was clean; the staff was helpful and friendly. The price was decent and the portions were ample.

I would recommend this place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"They have soooo many toppings and they're choice of drinks is amazing. They have strawberry and mango aqua frescas and I wanted to take a huge hug home with me. The pizza has that really great brick oven taste. My boyfriend is not a fan of pizza and he loves this place, that says a lot!"}
{"text":"First off, we went on a Friday night, so maybe it's our fault, but we waited an hour to order and 30 minutes after that to get the pizzas. So maybe don't go on a Friday. But once we move past that, the pizza is really good. Husband got the hi-riser dough, because he likes thicker crust. I got the regular crust. Then you customize your toppings, from sauces to veggies to meats and a drizzle on top. There are 4 sauces to choose from, tons of cheeses, lots of meats, and a plethora of veggies. Once it cooks, you can get any of the 6 or so drizzles on top. 
We got our pizzas and a salad to go. And we liked everything! The only food issue we had was there was no dressing on the salad. They didn't offer any either. 

Be prepared to wait. Be prepared to be bored because there is nothing to look at except people eating good looking pizza and other people waiting to eat said pizza. But it was pretty worth it.

ALSO: order online. Do. Not. Wait in that line. That's the problem (the web orders jump in the store orders whenever you get there to pick up, thus causing the store orders to be backed up) but the solution is to join that line. It will be faster. 

We decided that we'd return for this pizza on a non-weekend night because we can each get what we want for a decent price."}
{"text":"Great food at a fair price.  Would be a 4 or 5 star rating,  but couple of issues.  1. Cook dropped long pizza flipper on floor by oven and Manager. No one cared,  he hung it up,  went in back,  came back and used it.  2. It got busy twice while there.  Manager never helped and service was slow. Instead,  manager would hide by making boxes and adding to t the stack.  

Food and drinks great.  Just don't go when in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I've been super impressed with their food and service. Their menu is just super easy, get a 11\" pizza for one price with any number of toppings you want. It's that simple. They have a awesome oven. It's not one of those conveyer belt ones but an old school brick oven looking thing. The pizzas are cooked in 3 minutes. Once your pizza is done you can choice of additional drizzles or garnishing. I always go with the buffalo sauce. 

I have to say, the employees here are super efficient. They get you in and get your food to you ASAP. You can hear the employees encouraging each other while they work. It's a great atmosphere. You can tell they take pride in their work.

They are located in a good area. Easy access with a lot of parking around.

I highly recommend this place. It's one of the best!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, choose your own ingredients, and hot pizza at fast food prices.  I love Blaze Pizza and have been a fan for many years.  Did you know Lebron James is an investor and the Wetzel Pretzel owners are behind the creation of Blaze. 

A welcomed edition to the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Pizza is FIRE! Plenty of toppings! They even have beer and wine! Check it out for sure - plus hey have awesome customer service, too."}
{"text":"Sucks sucks sucks look if it was not for Labron James this place would be out of business. Walked in the people were not friendly at all the place was dirty and and the workers were touching their face with gloves then the food,so gross and. Is the pizza under cooked chewy bland confusion of a mess SAVE YOUR MONEY"}
{"text":"Had the BYO pizza with vegan cheese. Usually not a fan of vegan cheese but it was pretty good. I have gone back several times. The customer service is always on point too."}
{"text":"Their story (posted on Yahoo news) reads better than their eats. The pizza was a real disappointment. It started with a mediocre crust that's not hand thrown, just pressed. And it winds up being baked in a gas-fired oven. The best pizzas are made in coal or wood-fired ovens. 

Their spicy sauce tasted a bit weird. No anchovies were available for a topping; the original pizza in Naples always featured them. The riccota cheese was the worst; dry and sour in taste. The Italian sausage was the only decent tasting topping. 

Drinks? The blueberry fresca was too sweet by far. Their cute signage and helpful staff didn't quite make up for the food. Other major pizza chains turn out tastier pies.

The worst news arrived six hours after I ate my only meal of the day there, in the form of severe bowel distress. I suspect it was caused by food poisoning. From the cheeses or sausage? Who knows. 

Needless to say, never again..."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a takeout pizza. The place was super busy. Put my order came out fast. The people behind the line are friendly and cheerful. 
I order a custom pizza with white sauce and two pepperoni pizzas, all of them are delicious and only $28 with taxes. I also tried their agua fresca, so yummy. I noticed in the drink station they have three all natural sodas. Plus the place has vegan/gluten options. Quick easy and kind of healthy  Yay!!!"}
{"text":"So we have given this restaurant two chances now and both were average at best. The veggie toppings were not fresh and the crust burned. We both felt a bit ill after the first visit and figured out it had to be the squash which they didn't have the second time around. It's disappointing as we loved the East Bell Road location we tried but will visit other wood fired pizza places in the future."}
{"text":"Simple, easy and fast. This place is much like Fired Pie. I think the pizza crust is way good. They have an option to order a 1-topping or specialty pizzas or create your own. Fun, interaction with building the pizza the way you want it. Plus you can't go wrong pizza made in a  oven!"}
{"text":"Awesome food I love the whole niche concept restaurant idea. Anyways I like these guys a lot . the dough they use is fantastic and then list of available is quite extensive. Overall it was a great experience and I plan on eating here a lot more often. One side note tho sometimes they put a little too much sea salt on the pie and it can ruin it so I recommend skipping that part the pizza doesn't need it anyways ."}
{"text":"Great concept, TERRIBLE execution. There is ONE employee working every \"station\" so one person simply takes your name, one person places balls of dough into a press (which only makes one at a time), one person tops the pizza, one person works the cash register, and one person pulls the pizza from the oven. This easily creates a buildup of customers (that on most days wraps around the inside of the restaurant). I got a carry out pizza, which they CLAIM are done in 180 seconds. I left the restaurant with my CARRY OUT pizza 40 minutes later. The pizza most definitely takes longer than 180 seconds to cook, and the single oven can't handle many pizzas at a time, and neither can the SINGLE employee who manages the pizzas in said oven. After all of this hassle, the pizza is just mediocre. Here's a suggestion: go to ANY other pizza restaurant and wait half the time for the pizza to be made fresh and by a team of cooks with equipment that can accomodate more than one task at a time. Lebron better think again about slapping his name on this complete embarrassment of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great ingredients, great selection, great service, and i LOVE their lemonades.  

This is on the top of my \"order at the counter to order\" pizza places."}
{"text":"I have read all the reviews of this place and have to say that this place is amazing!

First, we have been here twice and both times the service was exceptional. This last time, we lost a ring in the garbage and they helped get it out. 

Second, the toppings are very fresh with great variety. We only wish they had broccoli but they have so many more than we would have expected. 

Third, their gluten free thin crust is great.  Wonderful flavor, just ask if you add a lot of toppings to have the crust well done. 

I have traveled around the country and internationally and this chain is actually one of the best. It's rare to say that but if you are looking for a thin crust pizza, come here.  

And yes it is fast, don't expect plates. That's what the pie plate is."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight.  Wasn't impressed with selection of toppings.  Pizza wasn't very crisp.  Service was awesome, though!  Employees were very courteous and engaging while we waited for our pizzas."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Pizzaroto is a lot better in my opinion. The employees are very slow as well"}
{"text":"I've seen this place driving by and like the fast casual, made your way pizza concept. 

The staff there was really friendly and the restaurant was clean. 

We took our three kids for dinner and got 2 pizzas. They do offer GF which is a plus for me. The kids said their pizza wasn't too spicy (sauce wise) which as any parent know can lead to a battle, which usually ends in wiping off all the sauce with a napkin. They said the sausage was a little spicy though so they picked them all off. 
The sauce was a little too tomato pasty (sweet) for me but it was still enjoyable. 

There isn't a very big seating area and only two larger booths for larger parties. The kids said it was also \"really cold\" and halfway through our meal ended up under some blankets we keep in the car for soccer games."}
{"text":"Love this place for pizza. The create your own option is the best. Only you can mess up your pizza. The reason I didn't give Blaze 5 stars is because they can be light handed on the toppings. However if you ask they will put a little more on when asked. The customer service is always great and the employees seem to like being there. Also $5 pizzas on Monday is the way to go!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take out twice now. I think the pizzas are the perfect size and you can tell it's all from scratch. You can order online from yelp and then pick up which makes it easy. I give 3 stars because 2 people in my home are dairy free and wheat free so having allergy options was the main reason we ordered here. You pay a surcharge for vegan cheese and gluten free crust which is completely understandable - but only 1 of the 3 pizzas had enough cheese to be categorized as a pizza. My kids were super upset they had to eat basically a tomato sauce pizza and we were on the road so didn't have vegan cheese at home to add on and didn't have time to turn around to have it made right. So seems like a nice place but don't appreciate paying extra money for something they short you on and end up making dinner frustrating in my home."}
{"text":"I hate to be he person who goes into restaurants super late because I know the feeling but I got of work really late tonight and ended up getting there at 9:55 and they still were happy to make my pizzas! The night crew at the Blaze at Arrowhead are amazing and the pizzas are always to die for; I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan! I love Fired Pie so I had to try this out. It was my first trip so I can't speak to consistency or anything like that BUT so far, I actually prefer it to Fired Pie. Their Red Sauce is excellent. They have some nice in-house sodas and lemonades too. The gentleman who made our pizza's today and checked us out was super friendly. All in all, an excellent experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast! Awesome pizza and great salad. 
Also love the deserts. 
I like that you wait go it and can see it being made"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The service was very fast and friendly - they did a great job explaining their process.  Everything was ready in about 10 after placing the order.  They also didn't nickel and dime me about adding extra toppings - which was fantastic!  Things to know going in - it's a personal sized pizza, but very filling!  This place is a definite must try!!"}
{"text":"I am SOOOOO happy that they put a blaze pizza near me! Have only seen them on the east valley and is pretty close compared to Fired Pie! I love how you can build your own pizza with as little or as much toppings as you want (like me I love double on everything I get lol) and it's under 10.00! Plus, the service is great every time I come in! My only recommendation is that I wish they would have fresh diced green apples as a topping because I LOVE LOVE LOVE apples on my pizza! Nevertheless, this place is clean and inviting!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Not. Typicaly not a Fan of thin crust but their pizza is amazing.  Better than modern pizza.  Great sauce and toppings."}
{"text":"I moved to an apartment right off of bell and 83rd and have a huge selection of places to est within walking distance. Blaze pizza really sticks out because it has great tasting pizza that has quality ingredients and also tastes great. The menu has some great pizzas that you can pick and choose to your tastes or you can be creative with your own design. I loved the quick service and short wait for affordable and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I just love Blaze sooooo much. They have great pizza and great service. Thanks to Hannah, the pizza was well developed and speedy. Definitely would recommend Hannah makes your pizza. Thanks Blaze for a great pizza!"}
{"text":"The only way I can describe this place is very average. 
We liked the idea of unlimited toppings on your pizza. The staff was very friend and very helpful since it was our first time in. 
My husband and I got the caeser salad, I did a build-your-own,  and he got the white pizza. 
The caeser salad tasted like it was frozen. It was odd and most of the lettuce looked old and wilted. 
On my pizza I got pepperoni, banana peppers, roasted garlic and roasted red peppers. It was probably one of the most bland tasting pizzas I've had. The only thing I could really taste was that garlic! And the pizza needed more cheese. They measured out the cheese to put on it and it didn't cover hardly any of it. I had to ask for more. 
The white pizza, my husband thought, tasted like fish. It wasn't his favorite. 
I feel like there are a ton of other pizza places around that have better flavor. But I will say, the staff was great!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is amazing here, and I love that they can get you through so quickly. This location is also very clean as well. 

Blaze has a vegan cheese option, and in general are very vegan-friendly. In my opinion the build-your-own option is a great deal as I usually pile on the veggies. 

Overall, I love it and will likely be back frequently in the future."}
{"text":"This was a very nice experience being able to design my pizza my way without getting charged for each and everything. I even got extra
Cheese my favorite! The people working here were very welcoming and helpful. This was our first time and they explained the process and were patient. The pizza was delicious the perfect crisp with chewy inside on the crust. We ordered double crust that's like a normal pizza instead of thin crust. The tables and chairs made you want to eat inside they were clean and modern. Very nice you see pizzas being made right in front of you. The price was super reasonable and they even do military discount. Thanks what a pleasurable experience"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is the best if you want a good pizza blaze pizza is the place to go there's so much choises"}
{"text":"Pizza is pizza, I went thinking it was going to be some great experience but left with just another pizza. No game changer there. I'd rather eat healthy and have a beer!"}
{"text":"Was my first time here today. I was greeted with a smile and a \"guide\" on how to order.. amazing customer service and amazing pizza. Came on a lunch break and made it back with plenty of time."}
{"text":"Very good red sauce and the pizza was actually crispy and not soggy with grease.  Will be stopping by again to try out some of their unique specialty pizzas"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I'm a thin crust pizza fan. This crust is almost too thin, in a cracker kinda way. Prefer the crust at Fired Pie. Similar setting and toppings as Fired Pie. Friendly staff. 1 kid wasn't a fan of the traditional tomato sauce. Would eat it again but would stop at Barros or Fired Pie first."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, all around great place! The staff was extremely friendly and inviting upon arrival. The food came out fast but was fresh and tasted great! Would definitely recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant tonight for take out. The girl who was helping us in the beginning was so nice and explained the menu to us as this was our first time to Blaze. My fiancé and I both decided to get the build your own so we could get all the different toppings we wanted. The girl continued to help me and was so nice and helpful. Daniel was helping my fiancé and WAS AWFUL. He would make a negative comments about every topping my fiancé got and then when my fiancé asked for a little more cheese he said \"I don't like when people mess with the cheese, that effects my food cost and also my bonus\"..... ummm... what? We didn't even know how to react. The pizza was good and we probably would have gone back if it wasn't for Daniel and his ridiculous comment. Sorry dude, I don't care about your food cost or your bonus. I care about getting what I want when I'm paying close to $10 for a pizza. I sure hope he doesn't do this or say this to many people because I'm sure this would cause others to not return and really effect his precious bonus."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as MOD pizza nearby and Fired Pie.
Choose the toppings you want and they make it for you there to eat."}
{"text":"Had to give it a try again this time we dined in. It wss like night & day from taking it home & dining in, the experience of ordering it was easy & simple reminds me of Subway concept & that's fine, I just wish when I asked for extra cheese add more than just a sprinkle more than the usual scoop. 

    I like how you can customize it to your likings, I had almost all meat except for sausage, I didn't realize they had salami which I've would've had asked for it, I had them drizzled bbq sauce on half of it the sauce was ok I like my BBQ sauce spicy this was more on the sweeter side. I definitely would go back..."}
{"text":"This location just recently opened within the last couple months, and at this point, I am not impressed. Surely the customer service is fantastic and friendly, however, the problem lies amongst the pizza preparation. They are extremely slow at merely writing your name down, which leads into their pizza making process. Be prepared to have to repeatedly ask for more cheese because they barely get any shreds on the pizza - they don't even fully fill up the measuring spoon that is provided. On the other hand, the employees are fairly speedy at making and cooking your pizza, so don't expect there to be a long wait. The location doesn't seem to be too busy around lunch time, which is nice considering that there isn't a ton of space inside. All in all, I will come back to this location, however, I would rather make the drive over to Fired Pie - I will update my review if I feel differently about it in the future."}
{"text":"Very fast and very delicious. They have tons of really great lemonade and unique sodas to choose from. Also they have goat cheese for a cheese option. Love it"}
{"text":"It's up at the top and I'll be visiting many more times I am sure.  The pricing is right on, almost everything I see offered is top quality and much thought was given to the menu selection top to bottom.  From healthier or less-bad for you drinks to fresh ingredients and a quality dough, it's tough to beat.  I can't for the life of me understand why people by crap pizza (the ones advertised every day on the tube).  

The crust was perfect- slightly crunchy and perfectly chewy, almost sourdough-ish.  The sauce was the one place I was not thrilled, but that's only because I like an almost tangy sauce where this was more to the sweet side of the scale.  You may love it.  The cheese was terrific- whole milk instead of that \"part-skim\" garbage.  Points off though for some canola and soybean oil presence- that is crap oil and not the least bit healthy.  Still, took home 4 pies including a Margherita to sample.  Good ol' pepperoni was a hit.

The drinks they make in house are pretty tasty, and the other offerings are carefully selected.  The one pizza that still reigns in my heart is Char, but you'll pay a couple dollars more.

Great place- could be off the charts, but great still."}
{"text":"I was so amazed with this place. I went there for the first time yesterday with dear friends of mine. I loved the gluten free pizza. My friends have been raving about this place and it did not disappoint. On top of that the service was absolutely amazing. I will most definitely be back. Totally worthy of the five stars when I go to a restaurant it was exactly what I expected and more. Added note, on point with that Olive oil and garlic roasted mix."}
{"text":"This has become a total favorite.   First time and I am hooked.   Great people working here.   The crust is amazing.   Will definitely be coming again and again.  Build your own.  How neat is that.   Give it a try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza I have ever had. First I didn't get everything that was suppose to be on it. While waiting they burnt a pizza and tried to cut the charcoal pieces off and was actually going to serve it to a customer. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"The pizzas were very good. Better than any papa johns or dominos in my opinion. It's like a personal pan size pizza and you can have the crust cooked to your taste. The toppings were fresh, and you can load your pizza up with whatever you wanted. The only downside was the eating areas were not clean and you had to clean your spot before sitting down. But once the lines went down the tables were cleaned promptly. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"First time I have been here & we LOVED it! We waited in line on a busy Saturday afternoon for about 15min, once we paid & sat down, it only took 5-8min til our pizzas were all 3 ready for us! We ordered a red vine pizza, a Lincoln & pepperoni & meatball...all with a balsamic drizzle! The crust was light & crispy just the way we like it, and NO stinginess with the toppings! I had the blood orange lemonade, my grandson the mango agua....soooo awesome! We tried all their custom drinks, but my favorite was that tangy Delish Blood Orange lemonade!!! Even took some to go!! For sure we will be back and will recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Two young girls working the line were clueless and slow as a sloth. Messed up my order twice and folded it over when they put it in the oven so had to trash it. At least they said sorry"}
{"text":"Waited in line for over 30minutes ... add 15 minutes to that and then tell us they lost our pizza.... how does that happen!!! Then they put a second one in and that one disappears as well. It would not let me process with no stars that's the reason I had to put one star here . New , inexperienced employees .  We are going to pizza Roto in Madison !!"}
{"text":"We got the BBQ Chicken & the Artichoke Combo.  Both were yummy.  For pizza lovers this might not be the place to satisfy your palate since the pizza is not covered in cheese.  However, if you like a thin crust, almost cracker like, with lighter, healthier toppings then you'll like this place.
Fast & friendly service was a bonus.  This would be a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"This pizza was fantastic we're definitely making all our pizza stops here! Fast service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I went in last weekend not knowing how to order and this girl I believe name was Emily, and she explained the menu really well and helped me decide what I wanted to get. Amazing consumer service, with great pizza."}
{"text":"Dear Mentor Blaze owners: I love Blaze. The pizza is fantastic. But omg please turn down the music for the love of ears and small talk with customers, get the assembly line organized (stop losing pizzas), put the \"fast\" in blaze fast-fired pizza, put a cap on online orders, and have a separate register for online orders! Y'all are new, I get it, but I've been part of a popular chain restaurant opening before and this place should be running more smoothly by now. And seriously - the music - I wish so much that Blaze would go with a more relaxed vibe and turn that crap down. Can't even hear myself speak to the workers. 

That said... the pizza is delicious and I'll be going back even if I have to wait a million years to be served a second pizza after the first was lost or burned. Until things are more organized, I can only give 2 stars."}
{"text":"Gave this a shot as there was no line and I was hungry. My friends had pizza and said that it was decent but no better or different than other fast order pizzas. I ordered an entree salad and was surprised to hear I couldn't alter it. Ok I can live with that, but the size was very disappointing. I thought I received a side salad but it was the entree size. Spent 7.65 to leave hungry. Sad!"}
{"text":"Jeremy is absolutely amazing! He is very personable and he goes above and beyond in his customer service. He made our first experience at blaze memorable and we will be back. The pizza was fresh and you could taste all the different flavors. We will be back to visit Jeremy! Hopefully this week!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I wrote a review to you saying that your service was terrible after waiting almost 2 hours for food enough for getting it. You had asked me to contact you so I did and you mail me free pizza coupons. 

Well, I tried to use them tonight for not being able to eat all day, I went into your location that is new in our area AGAIB and it took me over 40 minutes to get my food! With one person in line ahead of me. When I got to the end I told the manager that I would appreciate the pizza to be comped because it took so long. She started laughing at me and told me that they don't just give out free pizzas. I got upset and told her that that just didn't seem fair because it took so long while her staff was goofing around and it's took so long again with only one person ahead of me. She told me it wasn't her problem that she was under staffed. So it's mine!!? I told her that it didn't matter because I had a free pizza voucher, From when they messed up the last time. I handed it to her and gave the other one to the other person in line behind me as I stated I would never be back. She laughed at me and I asked for my pizza so I can leave. After that, she ended up comping the girl behind me pizza for no reason! And she had two pizzas! I do not understand that at all, when she just told me they don't give out free food. I asked about it and she said because she wasn't upset with her. That made no sense!! I grabbed my food and walked out and as I was leaving the staff was laughing at me and making snickering jokes behind my back! I cannot believe the amount of disrespect and poor customer service this restaurant has not only did I give them a second chance but they blew it the second time just as bad as the first. I work with people and I will be making sure that no one goes to this location, And I walked also be contacting the Better Business Bureau tomorrow and corporate to let them know what a terrible terrible place this is!"}
{"text":"Four stars on my first visit but probably be five stars after the second visit. I primarily eat as carb free as I can but occasionally have to have a piece if pizza. 
This place is very similar to many of the new pizza places. You can order from a menu with pizza that come with specific toppings or you can tailor make your pizza to your liking. Mine was excellent. I like a thin crust and that is what they have. Most of my toppings was meat. What I liked most was your options. While most places have many options they charge per topping. This was also an option here but the option I chose was for a set price you could choose as many toppings as you wanted. 
This is why I will come back many times. One price load your pizza. 
The service was good and pizza was ready quick. Also great helpful employees."}
{"text":"Their drink options are the main reason they're getting 5 stars. They sell the best lemonades!!! The blood orange one is $2 here with refills and at Wildflower is non-refillable for $6. So it is nice that it's so cheap here. 

The pizza is good and they have a TON of cheese options. They even have vegan cheese and goat ricotta! Definitely worth trying!"}
