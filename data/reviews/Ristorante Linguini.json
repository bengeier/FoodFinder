{"text":"If I could give zero stars for last night's pizza I would. I ordered their caprese pizza and asked it baked a little well done. What I got was a half burnt half raw pizza with what looked like the dog threw up cheese on. Needless to say I didn't eat it. Our friends ordered the prosciutto, olives and arugula which came without the arugula. The waiter comped our pizzas but did charge for our beers and salad. You would figure at the prices they charge they would take more care !!!"}
{"text":"Simply put... Go for the gnocci. It's the only pasta dish on the menu that is made from scratch. Typically the service is okay. For me, it's a once a year type of restaurant. Just because I can have an amazing Italian dining experience elsewhere for more value. The prices are generally inflated at Linguini and if you start comparing against authentic Italian restaurants downtown, you begin to feel ripped-off. But, if you live in the West and you don't feel like making the trek DT, this could be a good substitute for the night. Clearly, it's a destination restaurant and you are paying for the \"ambiance\" and I only recommend this restaurant if you have the money to explore restaurants. Most couples and family gatherings enjoy the cosy caban atmosphere. The wine list selection is good, but there are not many good price values to find (I could be wrong, but I didn't see any reds under 40$). So, sure you can go for the salmon, lasagna, rack of lamb, or steak, which are all good, but I just find it's funny that the name is Linguini, when the only fresh pasta made in house is gnocci. I believe a name change is in order."}
{"text":"Cabin like feel and look to this place, huge selection of dishes to choose from. Everything from the wine to the dessert tasted great."}
{"text":"Gnocchi! Yum yum yum!
Very cozy and romantic restaurant, especially in the winter... Like being in a wood cabin in the middle of nowhere (not on the side of a highway), with the fireplace going... So lovely :)
Escargots gratin√© was great too - the best my husband had ever tried."}
{"text":"Sadly as of November 2016, Linguini was permanently closed due to an intense fire. 
The restaurant owner plans to rebuild sometime in 2017."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 8. The night didn't start out well as we had to wait 15 minutes for them to set up a table. Apparently they didn't have our online reservation (despite having the email confirmation and a reminder). The rest of the night's service more than made up for that as they were very friendly and constantly made sure we were happy. The food was very good, with large portions. It all came out fairly quickly and together despite our group size. Actually we were one of the smallest groups there! 
I had the thin crust pizza, which was the best I've had in a while. The rest of my group had pasta dishes and everyone liked theirs (though the fettuccine Alfredo I tried was kind of bland). Apparently the carrot soup is awesome..."}
{"text":"Wow - I'm very surprised to see this place is closed, per Yelp! I was here a mere month ago and it seemed to be doing a pretty good business for a Monday night. This was my first night in the Montreal area after a long day of traveling; and Linguini was close to the hotel. A small group of us arrived about 7:30, after the hotel staff mentioned it to us.

Such a nice, cozy vibe here, and we received a friendly greeting immediately. I was amazed at the cabin-like decor inside, complete with crackling fireplaces, rustic furnishings and wood beams - surprising for an Italian spot on a highway frontage road.  They were fully decked-out for Christmas in mid-November, which made it even cozier.

Our group checked the wine list and ordered a bottle of Sangiovese while we perused the food menu. A large and varied selection here, though I focused on the smaller prixe fixe menu , which offered several options of apps and entrees, many of which weren't on the main menu. On that list I kept going back to the pork chop cooked in wine sauce with figs. I eventually gave in to my instincts and ordered it with their soup choice.

Meal in short - The lentil soup was fantastic; well-balanced and flavorful. The subsequent chop was cooked well but wasn't quite as good as I hoped; on the fatty side and the figs and wine flavors weren't coming through for me. The closing dish was a respectable chocolate cake, which went well with the wine...our second bottle... or was it the third? (there were 7 of us)

One weak point was the service - friendly and prompt at first; but then our waiter seemed to disappear for far too long. Once he re-appeared the service picked up, but was still pretty slow. We had to go seek him out to pay the bill.

I'm very likely to be back to this area within the next 6 months, and with such a large menu I'd love to give RL another try; but I don't know if I will get the chance. Though Yelp indicates this business is no more, the website is still up and taking reservations. Will I be the last one to review it? Here's hoping not.

{"text":"Every once in a while magic just happens!

I am traveling for business in Montreal this week for the first time and my hotel happens to be 1k away from this incredible little Jewel of an Italian restaurant...

The previous reviews are correct in saying that this place is a \"cozy lodge-like\" atmosphere, and that the food is very good (albeit a little pricey)...

However, what they fail to mention is exactly how hospitable their service staff really is... for those of you that remember the american comedy series \"Cheers\", think of yourself in that same friendly environment, but in a place where the Brick Oven pizzas and the Veal Marsala make you feel like you were dining in the heart of Little Italy...

If you ever make it to this southwest corner of Montreal, do yourself a favor and stop at this charming little restaurant called Liguini's... I will expect a personalized \"Graci\" after you do!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here, love the place. Always found it to be good value for the money not overly expensive. The wait staff usually are very attentive but not  bothersome."}
{"text":"Linguini's was good, but I've had much better italian dining experiences at other places.  I had the chicken linguine.  The chicken was done well, but I found the sauce to be a little thin.  The red velvet cake for dessert was excellent, however."}
