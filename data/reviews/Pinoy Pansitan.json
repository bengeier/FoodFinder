{"text":"Came here on an UYE organized by Christina T. What made me want to come to this event were the pretty darn good looking pictures of boodle fights shown by a Yelp friend and also more on the Internet. The second would be some good memories from the past where I had the opportunity to taste a few home made Filipino food.   The place is clean, staff is very nice and accommodating. Nothing fancy inside but food is good on average at least. The boodle table ingredients were ok, they didn't wow me but at least everything was nicely prepared, tasty and well presented in such an original way. My only gripe was using hands for eating and also lack of space on the table to comfortably put your plate if you decide to have one. But again, this is the traditional way of eating at this kind of table. No biggie but some might not be totally ok with the idea.   Overall, to me, it was worth the experience, specially the amazing scene of that all dressed table. One should try it at least once. Also, I'd go back to try their other dishes a la carte style but as per the nice waitress, it's advisable to call ahead to find out the menu du jour, as they change it daily."}
{"text":"I was invited by my philippine friend. So impressed with their traditional food! Tasty food and beautiful colors."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place FOREVER, and figured since I was doing my laundry at the Buanderie next door, why not. I'm not much of a pancit guy (I know, BAD Filipino), I always just felt the dish was a little overrated compared to other noodle options out there in the world. But I digress, because here is a decent-looking Filipino joint near my crib and I would like to be taken back home for a little bit. Because I had clothes to tend to, I didn't want to get anything that would take too long, but I did want to try one of their freshly cooked items on the menu du jour (they also have a hot tray section with some ready-to-eat items). Everything looked good (gotta try the bulalo next time), but I went for the sizzling pork sisig. Ten minutes later, a kind gentleman came out with a hot plate and poured the sizzling fatty concoction onto it. Oh man. Pork parts I didn't even care to inquire about, emanating succulent steam into my innocent face. It was good, though I had to pick out the liver parts. Yeah, I suck, but this wasn't the foie gras kinda liver, if you catch my drift. But otherwise, I dug it. Probably would've great with a beer. Do they even serve beer here? Anyways, thumbs up so far and I look forward to my return."}
{"text":"This shop is very comfortable with excellent food and inexpensive prices. The oxtail sinigang was the best I have ever tasted and the fried red snapper was delicious. I requested toyomansi on the side and was given fresh lemons to squeeze into my soy sauce. The warm atmosphere and great homestyle Filipino cooking impressed me so much that I came back the next day for dinner. Half of the menu had changed, so I got to enjoy different dishes that were equally delicious. I feel so comfortable here that the next time I might eat with my hands."}
{"text":"I am invited to friend's birthday to Pinoy Pansitan.  I have tons of Filipino friends; and I ate at their places countless times. So I know what is Filipino food is.  So when I received the invite; I was told the place takes only cash or debit. Plus, the type of food that I would eat, will be my hand.   I am intrigued; plus I have experience to eat by hands since we are Indians and Bengali.  When I arrived, a long table was set up for 30 people. It is called a boodle fight, or in Filipino called Kamayan. The table was filled with banana leaves, and food on top of them. There were rice, chicken thighs, oysters, sausages, grilled fish (with bones), Chinese broccoli, eggplants, eggs, pork chops, shrimps, mango, cucumbers, tomatoes and strawberry...   So 30 people sat around the table, were eating with their hands in one big plate... ( banana leaf).  What an experience! The food tasted so good, that there no words to describe.  The service was amazing. People were friendly.   Guess what, it cost only 25$ per person. I highly ask everyone to experience this boodle fight... but go with a big gang... it's more fun."}
{"text":"Oh wow. There is something that hits my heart and reminds me of being taken care of as a kid, and that's chicken and rice soup. Often this flavor is also in Chinese congee, and it happened to be in the most delicious rice porridge I've ever had. The first spoonful transported me somewhere else....called Lugaw with Tokwa't and Baboy the rice porridge is accompanied by pork and tofu in a vinegary marinade. Familiar and fresh at the same time, I am hooked on it. We also had the sizzling Pork Sisig which was a first for me, but also had some flavors that I recognized. Just in case we didn't have enough we also got the Pancit Palabok, which my guy said was totally traditional and how he remembered it. To round out the meal we got Halo Halo, and I spent quite a while digging around enjoying all the ingredients. This is a wonderful little spot, and I hope more people find it."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is amazing! Great and friendly service. Super accommodating and lovely atmosphere! Went here for the boodle fight, first time ever. Highly recommend any Filipino and non Filipino try it out. Fun and unique experience that you can't get anywhere else.  The waitress was super nice, the owners had a quick conversation with us, the place was well decorated and very clean. Desserts were also amazing. Will define come back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my uni's Filipino association so we got the boodle for only $20! The interior: really cozy. The staff: really friendly. The food: a lot. There was a lot of food. I packed a great portion home too. The best part is the red sausage. I also really liked the seasoning of the meats. Mussels and fish were pretty good too! And watch out for the egg--they're the really salty kind. So eat it in small pieces only!! The crunchy mango is also extremely refreshing because the acidity/sourness really cuts through the heaviness of everything else. I think the original price is $35 which is a bit steep but I did enjoy my time here so I may return!"}
{"text":"A small Filipino restaurant. It has wooden tables, benches and stools. I went with a fairly large group of friends for the buffet but because it's a small restaurant, we couldn't eat all together.   They put banana leaves on a table and spread the food all over, which you then eat with your hands. There was rice, fish, shrimps, oysters, chicken, pork, sausage, mangoes and some veggies. Unfortunately I couldn't eat most of the food because I only eat halal. However the fish was very well seasoned and tasted great!   The whole concept was such a wonderful experience. Being with friends made it better. The buffet was $25 per person (cash/debit only). The staff was very nice and made sure there was enough food.   Would I go back? No, because I can't eat most of the food. Also I found the benches uncomfortable to sit and eat on."}
{"text":"I am not a Filipina but do business with a large Pinoy community, and I visited many Pinoy restaurants and markets in the Cote ste Catherine area out of curiosity. This place is my favorite.  The food is really good, and what I really appreciate is the service. The cashier is such a sweetheart and has great customer service skills, which I found lacking at other establishments...  I wish I there were more food options sometimes, just because I want to discover more Pinoy cuisine, but what is there is already super! Also the location is a bit small/narrow and not much in the way of a stylish dining experience... so i order to go"}
{"text":"My next visit was a boodle fight between friends and... What an adventure! I was a bit uncomfortable eating from leaves and my friends dug in without question asked. We have everything from rice, sausages, tilapia fishes, chicken thigh, Chinese broccoli, veggies, mangoes, strawberries and so much more than I lost count of what we had. It was a feast to behold!   We were 7 at that night, it cost 30$ included taxes each for at least 6. When you get to 11, the cost is 25$ included taxes each. We finished the night where everyone was best friends with each other. Something about sharing a table full of foods builds a connection.  The place is well maintained and clean. The staffs were extremely friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"I'm new to Montreal and, being Filipino, I'm touring the town for good Filipino restaurants. I had a kare-kare and ginisang mongo combo. The kare was rather 'off'. It's almost like they cut corners to save on cost and maximize profit. The mongo was ok but nothing to write home about.  This place is just like most Filipino restaurants: they serve tiny portions measured in cups or bowls. No Filipino consumes that tiny amount. So you finish your meal and you're left wanting. I think the combo is worth closer to $8, not the $10 they charge.  I haven't been to the boodle fight so I can't comment on it.   Meanwhile my search continues."}
{"text":"C'est bon, rapide et très bon marché. Ambiance 100% filipino.  Excellent bubble tea glacé au taro. Très bon acceuil.  Je vais revenir c'est certain !"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, even my non-Filipino friends enjoyed the lunch and dessert. We went on a rainy day, so the noodle dishes were perfect for comfort food."}
