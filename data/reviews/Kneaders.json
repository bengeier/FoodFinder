{"text":"Make sure they are paying attention when you order. Placed order for two sandwiches and paid for them,  cashier wasn't listening and only put in one sandwich. Management didn't give a crap and I was left without lunch. Sucks won't be back. Service is crap."}
{"text":"Talk about great service recovery! Our order was put in wrong... That happens, no prob! The server and Asst Mgr came out and went above and beyond to fix it for us!! They took time out and made sure we were taken care of! Thank u sincerely Kevin and Hannah! Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to kneaders a few times and have gotten the Ruben every time. Previous experiences were ok, nothing to write home about, but this one might have been the worst sandwich I have ever been served, anywhere.  Meat was discolored, and the bread and cheese were stale."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service is very slow and unfriendly. I ordered three pastries, all of which were in the cases and already prepared, and I waited 15 minutes for someone to put them into a box. I understand that the cashier cannot box them up immediately after handing money and cash, but it still seemed a bit unfair that I had to wait behind all of the sandwich orders. Perhaps there could be a better system for handling customers who are only buying pastries?"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery & Wildflower put this place to shame.  I tried to customize my order and it wasn't allowed! Seriously, I wanted to add an item to a sandwich combo and willing to pay for it too, but they couldn't."}
{"text":"Tried the place and food was not bad. I was wondering why there were so few patrons in the place. Used the men's room  on the way out. A freaking cockroach was on the floor of the restroom. Fuggettaboutit! You decide!"}
{"text":"The going guava smoothie was superb, but when they brought it to my table they refused to bring me a straw. I begged and pleaded, but the straw bever came. After walking a whopping 10 paces I finally got a taste of that sweet, sweet smoothie and it was SPECTACULAR!"}
{"text":"I frequented this location quite a bit...until I found hair in my sandwich yesterday.  I brought the sandwich to the counter to let them know.  While they offered to remake it, I had lost my appetite and was no longer interested. They didn't really seem phased by this. No apology. No acknowledgement. Nothing. I know when you eat out, this kind of stuff happens. Under cooked, over cooked, missing this or that...but come on. The customer service at this location is definitely lacking. I am really disappointed by this ESPECIALLY because it's slightly more costly than any other fast food joint. I won't be back to any Kneaders."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here. I've passed it so many times and grew curious. I had the Chicken Pesto Panini, which was done so fast I had to hurry and find a place to sit. I thought, Wow I hope these are not pre-packaged and sitting under a food warmer. I tried it and immediately grew disgusted by the soggy texture of the bread and the chicken wasn't freshly grilled. In fact, it tasted re-heated and unpleasant. I started to watch how long it took others to receive their food and it was definitely a lot longer than me. I refused to eat anymore. Not impressed, wish I could have went to Jason's Deli or Pita Jungle instead. 1st timer but I will not be going back. Wasted $9.11"}
{"text":"We just love their food!! Everything is so fresh! The breads are all home made and insanely good. If you buy a whole loaf you won't believe the weight of it compared to the normal grocery store bread. The staff is so friendly at the Ray/48th location and seem to really care about us each time my wife and I visit. Well done Kneaders! This should be their tag line... \"When you have a need, go to Kneaders!\""}
{"text":"Love the food and selection. I asked for my salad a specific way and they were happy to oblige and had it perfectly right! Service is always friendly.  Wished they offered delivery."}
{"text":"Hazelnut bread is awesome, I even take some home to make sandwiches. Prefer this place for breakfast and coffee. Nice location and staff!  The coffee is way better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try Kneaders yesterday 2/26/14 after shopping at Target. We popped in through the drive-thru and were surprised at the selection. After ordering 3 adult meals and a kids meal we tootled home. Once we got there and unpacked I noticed they forgot all of our chips and pastries for the meal combos. A quick drive back and going in meant standing in line. Once I was to the front the manager was very apologetic about what happened  and gave me a free loaf of any of their bread I wanted to make it up to me, and also verified that was enough.    My point, they are new, they are bound to make mistakes but the fact the manager seemed very bothered by it, and even after tossing something free at me, wanted to make sure that was enough and was willing to do more to make sure I was happy, says a lot about this place.  The food was amazing, the portions are big, it seems pricey when you think you are ordering a sandwich but once you get it you understand. I had a fruit tart from there that is better than any I've had before.   We will go back, and often. I am very happy they have moved into our area and look forward to telling all of my friends and co-workers about it."}
{"text":"I hear there are usually long lines but lucky when I went it wasn't bad. I enjoyed my panini. I hear the breakfast is excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is good.  The French toast breakfast is great.  I've had lunch here several times as well and enjoy the sandwich/soup combo.   Pastries are always good.  The 3 stars is because there is no wifi.  Who in this day in age doesn't have wifi??  I would come here more often if they did."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. A local business in Ahwatukee, what's not to love?  I've been there three times -- two lunch sandwiches and one breakfast sandwich. One lunch sandwich was great, yet on the next visit the amount of turkey was significantly less. I sent an email lamenting the inconsistency, but never heard back. This morning I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich, consisting of a couple eggs, sausage, cheese, and served on a croissant. Sounds yummy, yes? But sadly, the sandwich was totally lacking in flavor. I'm not sure how you can put those ingredients together and have it come out tasteless. Regrettably, I will have to pass on a return visit."}
{"text":"Good food, clean restaurant, lots of random gift items. Bakery items looked awesome but I had a soup and salad. Portions were good and all ingredients seemed very fresh. Will back again soon."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive considering the amount of food you receive. Been here a couple of times and ordered just a sandwich and have to wait for at least 15 min. Went through the drive through since I thought it would be faster but nope I was sitting in my car for 18 minutes. 18 minutes in the drive through just for a sandwich!!! When I finally came to the window to get my food the lady was not friendly at all. Won't come back here again."}
{"text":"I have been to this Kneaders location no less than 20 times since they first opened.  Each time I said it was time to write a yelp review but once I got home, I  tried to overlook the poor, unfriendly service that I received.  Today is the day I write a review.   Let me start by saying, I always go through the drive thru.  95% of the time, the service has been less than friendly and many times, I felt that I was putting the employee out by even using the drive thru.  I have waited as long as 22 minutes in the drive thru (4 cars ahead of me) only to be greeted at the window with, \"$16.34.\"  No, \"Sorry for the long wait\".......No  \"Thank you for your patience\".....nothing!   On NUMEROUS occasions ,  the bag was handed to me ....\"here you go\" and the window was shut on my face.  I found I was the only saying, \"Thank you.\"  I've come to the conclusion, they place their most unfriendly and rude employees at the drive thru window.   I don't take it out on the employee because obviously, they have not been trained properly in customer service.   Today, around 11:30 AM, my son went to Kneaders to pick up lunch.  I have posted a picture of how they packed the bag  ---1 full sized sandwich, an order of french toast and an order of bread pudding.  They were not placed in 2 bags or flat in the bag but they crammed all of it in one bag,  on their SIDES!   The inside of the sandwich slide out of the bread and was loose in the plastic container.  The bread pudding and french toast...well, you can imagine how those looked.  THIS is what prompted me to finally write a review.   I watched this location  being built and on the first day it opened, I went through the drive thru and spoke to a trainer who was here from Utah.  I told him how much I was looking forward to the restaurant opening and that Ahwatukee needed a place like Kneaders.   Ahwatukee is a small community within a large city.  Word of mouth goes a long way in this area.  Management needs to start reading the yelp reviews, respond and make changes accordingly.  My next trip to Kneaders will be to return my loyalty card."}
{"text":"Kneaders is great for soups and desserts! Much better than Paradise. Their Asiago bread is my favorite! I could eat the whole loaf! Can't wait to go back and try their French toast breakfast."}
{"text":"The past couple times have been awful. The last citrus chicken salad I got was covered with cooking grease from the chicken. Almost 3 tablespoons worth at the bottom of the salad. Completely inedible. Great job Kneaders!"}
{"text":"This place is a Paradise Bakery knock off with poor service. My wife and I went there and I ordered a Turkey Reuben. The Manager/OWNER told me it would be $2.00 extra to substitute Turkey from Pastrami. Then he went on to tell me the Panini sandwiches are sent to them pre-made and that was part of the reason. So $10 bucks for a pre-made sandwich? Well what is the rest of the reason to charge $2.00 extra??  Just to make a sandwich fresh?  I expect a sandwich from this place to be made when I order it, not one that was previously made and possibly frozen for shipping.   My wife and I have tried to give this place a shot on more than one occasion. But each time we have left there disappointed. We have visited a Kneaders on Gilbert and Baseline and loved the food and service, but we live here in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Breakfast at kneaders is to die for! Try the unlimited French toast! Divine!   Great service! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"We have just had a delicious meal at the Kneaders in Ahwatukee  and wanted to share that Ryan showed excellent customer service!  We already had sat down and he took our credit card to keep us from having to wait in line, when we decided last minute to order Thanksgiving rolls.  Great job Ryan!! Thank you for making our experience so lovely this week!"}
{"text":"I went into Kneaders today about 2:00, walked right up to the counter to order. I made eye contact with a worker and he didn't say anything, he walked by 3 more times and still nothing. 2 other workers were right there too, but nobody acknowledged me. He finally said \"have you been helped?\", After a while. I finally got some help. Food is good, Desert is delicious, but not happy with the crappy customer service."}
{"text":"Great menu options and the interior décor is so cute!  I've had mixed experiences with their food.  The first visit I ordered the chicken salad croissant and (while delicious) there was only a small amount of chicken salad on it, mostly just bread.  So that was kind of disappointing.  Next visit I ordered the French dip on the baguette and it was great.  Loved it.  Our last visit last night wasn't quite as great.  My husband ordered the French dip, but this time there was very little meat and just mostly bread, so he was very bummed about that.  I also tried to order a sugar cookie and they were all out.  :(  So...mixed reviews.  Maybe it depends who is in the kitchen that day.  But I think a restaurant should be consistent and I should get the exact same French dip, no matter which day I order it.  And its my pet peeve for restaurants to be out of menu items...so, hopefully they will work out these kinks once they've been open longer."}
{"text":"First day open and I was very excited to try Kneaders! I was not disappointed. The restaurant looks great, and the location is perfect for the area. The pricing was better than I expected, and the serving sizes were big for the money. I only got to try breakfast and a smoothie, but if this is an indicator I will absolutely be going back"}
{"text":"Best French toast I've ever had! Sandwich bread is always fresh and all those desserts are so hard to choose from!!! Love the interior always fun stuff to look at and buy after you finish eating!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the egg bacon cheese croissant sandwich with scrambled eggs. The food is delicious. There is a guy that is there every time I go. He seemed super nice. Kinda too nice and the more I go he seems like he's not happy there? I don't know I may be wrong but I'm starting to notice the fake smile. Sometimes I feel he gets annoyed because I ask for scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Tasty food and baked goods. Its a great spot for breakfast or lunch, a little too expensive for what you get, for my tastes, but i don't think you would ever leave there upset about what you just ate."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place for breakfast. I go a lot with my dad to get the unlimited French toast that is seriously so yummy! They also have amazing cannoils!"}
{"text":"Small portions and not good tasting food.  In the words of David Sedaris,  it was so bad...and there was so little of it! I ordered the Reuben panini and it was $8.87 after tax.  It's not really a panini,  just a half heartedly pressed sandwich.  It came with a pickle and chips.  The sandwich was small to average sized and contained pastrami, sauerkraut,  cheese and a very unpleasant tasting dressing.  The pickle was nice and crisp but the chips were stale, kettle style but without the  crunch they're supposed to have. Drive thru service was neither friendly nor unpleasant,  just indifferent.   This should be a $5 sandwich,  not  a $9 sandwich.  Do yourself a favor if you're in the area and go to Jason's Deli,  Paradise Bakery or Hillside Spot instead."}
{"text":"I came to this establishment solely to pick up deserts for a dinner I was heading to. They were ordered and then we moved aside to wait for them to be boxed up. As we are standing there waiting a lady came in and starts picking out several deserts and what does kneaders do but gives this lady the pasteries that we had just bought. They then try to say that she had ordered them first but clearly we saw her in line after us. The only thing they did was refund our money for the inconvinace  nothing...   What kind of business does that.. one that will never have me or anyone I tell this story to as a customer again."}
{"text":"Been here many times since they opened but the service seems to be getting very lax to out it politely. My order today was incorrect and I got an apology for the misunderstanding but no offer to refund the money for 2 soup bowls I did not order but paid for.  So in short I had to pay for their mistake. It looks like they just lost another customer to Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"I swear every single time I come here something is left out of my order! The first time I came here they forgot to put avocado on my sandwich. Then it was no syrup for my French toast, now they hardly put any cranberry on my sandwich. Do I really have to double check my order every single time I leave this place? Worry about accuracy not speed please."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a healthy sandwich and bakery style treats. If your looking for a tasty alternative for a lunch on a Saturday afternoon Kneaders is the place to go. Closed on Sunday's..."}
{"text":"Short version: Great product, horrible customer service.  We've visited this location about a dozen times since we live less than a mile away, and we really want to like it, but this is no easy task.  Little thing: they forget part of our kids meals (i.e. the main entree) 50% of the time for drive through orders.  Bigger thing: consistently horrendous customer service.  I don't think that everyone working there is equally horrible, but there are a few especially bad apples, especially one guy who is a manager/supervisor.  This guy is is unabashedly snotty and unpleasant.  His idea of managing (from the customer's point of view) is to hover over employees as they process any order that takes more than 15 seconds and scowl over their shoulder at the customer if anyone stops to ask a question about *anything*.  One encounter that mirrors every experience we've ever had at this location: Our daughter has a severe egg allergy, so when we asked the first employee about their products' ingredients, they punted the question to Mr. Scowlface who proceeded to direct us to the signs under each pastry in the window (how could we be so stupid as to not know that ahead of time?).  Then we asked about other items' contents so we could order something that wouldn't be life threatening to her, and of course he reacted as though handling another question would cause him a great deal of personal pain and anguish.  I think it's safe to say that this this guy is in the wrong industry."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of two times now, both through the drive thru. The first time I ordered a guava smoothie, the club sandwich, and a lemon muffin top, I was very impressed and knew I would be coming back! The bread on the sandwich was what sold me, however the sandwich itself I found to be a little overly mayo-d. Today I picked up some pancakes with a side of bacon and sausage and I think they might be the best pancakes I've ever had. Thick, fluffy, and the home-made caramel syrup tops it off nicely by not being overly sweet. So far, so good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've been here only a few times since its opening. Twice through the drive-thru and once inside. Each time the service was very poor. Almost rude.   When it happened in the drive-thru, I chalked it up to it being the drive-thru.   When I actually went inside with my sister visiting from out of town, the service was unfriendly and unwelcoming. As if they were annoyed that we came in on a weekend afternoon while they were open for business...  3 stars because the food that I had was good.  The French Toast is delicious and where else can you drive-thru for French Toast?  The Turkey Dumpling soup - yummy.    Not sure though if the food is good enough to make up for the attitude...."}
{"text":"Very limited vegetarian options. Had a cheese sandwich, that was ridiculously expensive and not tasty. Also, my soda was all ice and no drink. While the drive-thru attendant was nice, I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"What has happened to Customer Service?  I just had the worst experience at Kneaders Bakery.  My wife and I stopped in for a couple of salads and a small treat to take home afterwards.  After placing our orders, the manager came out to give us our food.  The problem was he only brought half of the order.  When I went to the cashier to get the other half, she was great and gave me what I was missing.  I then get back to the table and realize the original half was made wrong.  This time the wife went up to the cashier.  She wasn't looking for a free meal or refund, she simply wanted what we ordered.  The manager overhearing the conversation inserted himself into the conversation and abruptly responds, \"So, what do you want me to do about it?\"  Uh, how about give me what I ordered?  Or how about lose the attitude?  If I am going to spend my time and money to go out to eat, I don't want attitude.  Needless to say, the next time the wife asks where do you want to go for lunch?  I will definitely avoid going back to Kneaders."}
{"text":"This place is great. Honestly, the best croissants I've ever had. The staff is very pleasant and knowledgable. The later is very important because the dessert case, next to the register, is HUGE!!!  Every dessert I've had there is great, however the two types of bread pudding that they have, are the best (I think one is berry and one is apple?)."}
{"text":"Once again great service and food at Kneaders Ahwatukee! The manager and employees are always so polite and answer all my questions and requests! Even through the drive through they have been patient and extremely helpful!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!! You can't go wrong with their French toast or their fresh-baked pastries or their salads and sandwiches. Everything is great, gorgeous new location."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The staff is super friendly, courteous and very efficient. Would definitely recommend coming here often."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot. They have some delish dessert pastries & breads. I have tried their French toast breakfast special. Good portion & I believe it's all you can eat if you dine in. Not that I could even finish the plate I started with.  We have tried a few of their desserts. If you are a chocolate fan, Their chocolate mousse dome, is yummmy!! They also have a small fruit tart, nice lil bite of deliciousness haven't tried any of their lunch items... But I guess that could be on our next stop. Would recommend you ask for their \"loyalty card\" it adds up points or $$, not sure, but have to ask or mention it BEFORE YOU PAY. Because of course they will not mention that it's not valid after you pay...  lol."}
{"text":"Ok only went through drive through and got soup and a smoothie. But the guy at window was super nice, and not that fake way. Smoothie was good, soup was ok."}
{"text":"I come for the pastries. I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about lunch but I have to say- they definitely know bread. The quality of bread really makes it here. If you're a foodie that knows a good loaf, you'll definitely appreciate this.  The pastries are constantly changing but for the mini pies and cannolis, get there early in the morning and eat as soon as possible. The crispy, flaky bread definitely doesn't stay that way all day. Get 5 and then they're discounted. Totally worth it. I LOVE the German chocolate pastries (not a cake but more like a layered square) and the bottomless French toast is to die for. Seriously amazing.   Additionally, the atmosphere is pretty cute. There's a little shop with trinkets to look at while you're waiting for your goodies. The coffee is always solid. The staff are attentive and friendly and usually pretty young. I've had nothing but great experiences here :)"}
{"text":"Really like the selection of food, although last time I got the citrus salad and there were maybe two large sections of grapefruit and that was all. I was disappointed. I like their smoothies and their pastries are delicious. I'm always in a rush so I don't usually go inside."}
{"text":"I had a surprisingly good experience at this place. My expectations were very high but I have expectations. As a low carb diet kind of guy I was a little worried but pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very lively and positive. The service was great too I asked for opinions and I got them. I asked for recommendations based off of my diet and received them. Just quality people here and I like that."}
{"text":"I came in for their breakfast and everything on the menu looked delicious but I wasn't in the mood for something heavy like French toast. So I decided to get their steel cut oatmeal. Something simple but so delicious! They have flavor options like banana nut, cranberry walnut and fresh fruit. I got the fresh fruit and didn't even have time to mix the fruit in I ate it right away! Yum  they have options to please everyone and every hunger level  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the quality is excellent I love the atmosphere, and the food is always delicious! It's in relaxing spot for and casual lunch and I usually always end up buying something from the gift area, and the peanut butter cookies are delicious and buttery!"}
{"text":"I come here to this Kneaders location often. I only use the drive through except for once. I must admit that my drive-thru experiences far outshine my visit inside. They are always courteous, knowledgeable and very accomodating. My food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with family (teenaged kids) for lunch and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I had the turkey cranberry sunflower salad and it was amazing.  The cookies and cinnamon buns are out of this world.  Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great pastries. Great for breakfast all you can eat french toast. Amazing sandwiches for lunch. Good ice tea. Very friendly staff and overall a great place."}
{"text":"Part of my job is to pick up different incentives from businesses in the Arizona area. I had to do a pick up from Kneaders and figured I might as well have lunch there too. That was on Monday and since then me and my Mom have been coming here every day this week. Their sandwiches and paninis are delicious and so are their desserts. Their staff is as nice and polite as can be and their manager Josh is always there to help you out. I highly recommend Kneaders to anyone that's hungry and willing to spend some money."}
{"text":"I stopped by after work at 8 pm and ordered a sandwich.  The sandwich was really good and the ice tea was good too.  I tried a chocolate peanut butter cupcake and it was good.  I will be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed lunch at Kneader's, especially their chicken and berry salad with feta and walnuts. Recently I was able to try their French toast which was also delicious. My only complaint is that, while it came out exceptionally fast, it was a little cold upon arrival. Other than that it was great! Staff was extremely friendly as well. #lfthx"}
{"text":"I have never had this kind of service.  Honestly.  I went inside to get a coffee and a muffin.  I stood for a few minutes reading the menu.  Not one employee acknowledged my presence.  The cinnamon rolls smelled amazing, so I looked around for where to order.  I found a little kiosk where an employee might take my order, but it appeared to be blocked off with a bread slicer that needed cleaned up.  I moved around a couple of times, tried to catch someone's eye, made eye contact with an employee who smiled and went back to what he was doing.  By this time, I'm pretty sure I've been standing here for 5 minutes.  Really.  so I left.  I get in my car and think about how amazing that freaking cinnamon smell was.  I decide to try the drive thru.  I was able to order quickly.  I thought maybe this was the stores forte.  Nope, wrong again.  Sat in the drive thru for another 5 minutes, and now I'm stuck. There's someone behind me. I sat still so long I shut my car off.   I finally get my stuff.  Good cinnamon bun, good coffee, but I won't be back to this location.  Lots of staff, place looks nice, but they don't care about service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their Mexican hot chocolate. However, the drive they wait is always ridiculous. I am in their drive through right now as I am writing this, there is no one in front of me or behind me and only a few people inside. I've been waiting for about 10 minutes and all I ordered was my hot chocolate...how long does it take to make????"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. It is similar to a Panera or Paradise Bakery.   I have enjoyed the selection of breads here much more, 5 star. Every time I have been here the service is exceptional, 5 star. I have been in line 10 orders deep and I have walked in and only had one in front. Either way service is quick and very friendly. The dinning area is always kept clean. Exterior is attractive. I like the soups but they nothing to write home to mom about. Example, the Tomato Basil Ravioli reminds me of \"Chef Boyardee.\"  Minor improvement can be made, but what they have going is a money maker for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of the most amazing sandwich shops I have been too. The turkey is out of this world, fresh and moist. Their breads are all VERY GOOD! The Carrot Cake and Apple Bread Pudding is some of the best I have ever had! I would recommend this place to anyone that likes good sandwiches! The store has a country vibe with cute gifts to buy at reasonable prices. Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Beware of Kneader's. I have a Frequent Diner Card. On at least 2 occasions, the staff took my order and rang it up quickly before I could get my card out. They said I couldn't get points because the sale had gone through and \"All Sales Are Final\". The least the staff could do for good customer relations, would be to ask the customer if they had a Frequent Diner Card before they finalized the transaction. It is deeply disappointing as the food is quite good. It's as if they have the program, but don't want you to actually use it.  Additionally it would be helpful if the cashier knew the ingredients of the selections they sell. On 2 different occasions my wife asked what was in a particular menu item, and both times the cashier had to leave and go into the back and ask for information. They need to be more knowledgeable about their menu. These comments are specifically for the Tempe store on Elliot Rd."}
{"text":"Love their food but the time it takes to get through their drive thru line is ridiculous. Plan on spending a minimum of 20-30 minutes in line!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow slow! No point in using the drive thru because you would have taken the same time parking and going inside. If you must go, great brownies and turkey sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"I just received rotten lettuce for the second time in a Kneaders \"salad\". This is in quotes because there is nothing in this \"salad\" but lettuce. It came with a side of dressing, so I guess that makes it a salad? It came as a side to my over-salted, under-chickened chicken salad sandwich. The last time I received a not insignificant amount of rotten lettuce in a salad from this location was in a turkey feta salad which was about 1/3 inedible lettuce. During my previous visit I ordered chicken dumpling soup. There wasn't enough chicken in it to even label it \"chicken\" so maybe it has this name because they use chicken broth? I've never been to another Kneaders but this location is extremely disappointing. I will not return and I will be shocked if they are still open 12 months from now."}
{"text":"Went back in today and received awesome customer service from Paula. Tried the turkey cranberry croissant and wasn't disappointed! The greens were fresh and the soda fountain was bubbly!! Great work, kneaders!   Delicious pulled turkey! Hella fluffy focaccia! I came here for a fresh lunch and was (mostly) satisfied. My main complaint is receiving discolored lettuce in my entree salad. The soda machine was flat, too! Complaints aside the other components were perfect, especially the avocado! The dessert case was huge and beautiful- it took all my might not to order one. However, I did eat the entire complimentary piece of fresh made focaccia. Yum yum yum. The staff were friendly and had an impressive sense of urgency to make sure the intimidating line moved very quickly."}
{"text":"For people who love fast food service yet upscale food. A Kneaders dessert is a treat you must try. Do your taste buds a favor."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING, service is SLOOOW!!! Kneader's in Gilbert, AZ off of Baseline & Higley is AMAZING, NEVER A COMPLAINT!!! I really tried to give the Phoenix location to get in the groove after opening, but months later, they are still HORRIBLE!!! Too bad, they are right across the street from my work.  I hope this goes out to the powers that be to step it up!"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place, but my experiences so far have been underwhelming. I usually grab lunch on my break and take it back to the office, so having a healthier drive thru option rather than calling in orders is great for me. I have been here twice. The first time, I got a sandwich. Compared to the thick focaccia bread, the meat was practically nonexistent. Now I know focaccia bread is supposed to be thick, but the contents need to match so I don't feel like I'm just eating a loaf of bread.  My second visit, I got the turkey bacon avocado salad with ranch and a slice of sourdough. They forgot the sourdough, and the salad had one tiny piece of thinly sliced bacon on it. The turkey was abundant enough and there was a quarter of a fresh sliced avocado. Not terrible, but a pretty boring salad I could have easily made at home. I do appreciate two sides of ranch as most places are stingy with the dressing.  The person at the drive thru on my second visit also seemed like he would rather be anywhere else in the world at that moment. He would cut me off with \"anything else?\" before I even finished asking to hold the tomatoes. I know the lunch rush can be hectic and patience wears thin, but my order was painless. No need to rush me.  Overall it's not terrible, but definitely not worth $10.59 for a salad and a small drink.  UPDATE 2/26/2014: I tried to give this place a chance. I really, really did. But I think I'm done. I have visited this place (drive thru only) about 6 times since my first review. I order the turkey bacon salad every time, hold the tomatoes. I've gotten tomatoes every time except once. I even once told them I was allergic, hoping that might get them to pay closer attention. Nope. I asked for croutons once, got a slice of bread. I asked for croutons another time, got nothing. I ordered a sprite that turned out to be soda water. Received no napkins/forks on another occasion... etc., etc,. etc,. It's unfortunate that small mistakes like these would cause them to lose a customer, but they're SO consistent with their mistakes, I can predict them before I even receive my food.  The one thing that has improved over time is the customer service. It's gotten much friendlier. Unfortunately that doesn't make up for everything else. Another location is opening up on Elliott soon. Maybe I'll give them a shot because I still love the idea of a fast food salad that actually uses fresh ingredients, but I'm definitely done with this location. Too bad."}
{"text":"The best salads, sandwiches ever! I've been here many times now. The turkey bacon salad is my favorite. They also gave a chocolate dome dessert. By far the best dessert I've had in years. You can just go buy that. This place is great. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon caramel french toast was rich and tasty. There are lots of great looking breads and pastries to take home. The counter service was friendly and helpful and the store was well-kept.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I have been to several Kneaders in Utah and Arizona.  Now that this one is so close to my house I'm afraid I'll be there all the time!   I haven't had anything I didn't like.  It is Paradise Bakery - but WAY BETTER.  The Cinnamon French Toast is AMAZING and it is ALL YOU CAN EAT - However the initial portion is so large I can't imagine asking for more. The caramel syrup that is served with the pancakes and french toast is divine.  This place is SUPER kid friendly. My kids LOVE the kids meals - especially the cookie! My picky son is so happy that they have peanut butter and jelly as an option with grapes as a side.  The Turkey Avocado Sandwich is delicious and a HUGE portion.  However my new favorite item is there Chocolate Coconut Bread Pudding. Be sure to have them warm it up for you. WOW it is amazing!    I hope I continue to love the place.  I think it is a fantastic addition to Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I want to love this place so much, I keep going back to be disappointed. I love the homey displays and the expensvie aprons along the wall.  The food is good but I dislike that nothing comes with the sandwich except for a small container that has lettuce in it. (FYI - this is not a salad...lettuce and a sm side of dressing does not = salad) They spend more money on the containers than the food that is in them and this makes me crazy. Why can't you put a bit of tomato or onion or cucumber on it? Why I ask? What about a pickle?  I love the home style turkey used in everything, I hate that tomato doesn't come on the sandwiches and I forget to ask for it.   I highly recommend their bread but is pricey. I like the sacks for fresh bread end for cheap if you are lucky to time it right. And did you all know that Saturday night after a certain time all breads are buy one get one.. Because they are closed on Sunday.   I think I like Panera better... Sorry Kneaders"}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches, yummy baked goods. But do not bother coming here at noon on a Saturday. We walked in at 12:15 and didn't leave until 1:00!!! The line wasn't long at all, it just took them forever to take people's orders, then had to wait half an hour for our food to come up. The manager walked by us a couple times and we were obviously irritated, they looked at us a couple times and of course they didn't care that everyone's orders were taking so long. Next time we're definitely calling our order in ahead of time. Such a waste of time standing there, and to top it off half of our order seemed like it had been sitting there a while before the rest was ready. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab something fresh (rather than deep fried). Today I ordered the club sandwich, and it was HUGE (included a picture by my hand for reference). I've also had their breakfast (the Carmel syrup is to die for). It is a bit on the pricy side, but the servings are so huge that I usually get two meals out of one. I definitely recommend trying the pancakes (at least once)- they're THAT good!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon a brand new Kneaders on w McDowell rd in Tolleson. They were handing out free French Toast to the first hundred customers which was just excellent as was the coffee. I went back a couple of days later with my laptop and ordered a Mocha. They don't have wi fi yet and when the server brought my mocha he asked me if I wanted \"expresso\" in it. He took my drink and added it, pretty good though and didn't burn the milk either. Good, friendly service and a modern ambience."}
{"text":"The place has a great bakery, but if you want to have the lunch or the diner, the final price you will pay maybe doesn't worth for what you will eat. Think about it, you will pay for a combo of sandwich, small chips, soda and pastry $15. There are other places where you pay this money for two meals . Anyway try a Eclair by 2.59, it's great!"}
{"text":"The service here was faster than the other two locations I have been to.  However, the customer service was pretty flat and bad.  The employees bordered on rude, unhelpful and intrusive.  The soup is delicious.  The bread the is okay.  The pink pina colada smoothie is amazing but at 700 calories should probably be skipped.  My daughter did not like the hot chocolate at all and had to get a refund."}
{"text":"I had the worst customer service experience this morning at this location. I went in to purchase pastries for gifting local offices for my employer. It's the morning time so of course there are customers and out of consideration of other people wanting to order I asked the gal at the register if maybe she could get somebody else to help me to place my order. She called up a young man who proceeded to greet me with what's up. I asked him if he wouldn't mind just coming over to the bakery window so that I can place my order and he said to me \"can't you just list off what you want to her\" and referred to the girl at the register. I politely told him no I can't because I'm going to be placing a large order and I asked him if he could come over to the bakery window because I needed several different items in multiple quantities.  And these pastries are like 1.99 to 2.99 a piece so I'm spending a chunk of change...is it too much to expect that I could get some customer service?  And when I try speaking to the manager about the customer service all he has to say is\" I've got one person out  throwing up and I'm just trying to deal with staff what can I do to help you?\"  At that point I said \"nothing\" and I left.   I don't care how fresh your ingredients are or how good your pastries are I will not be going to Kneaders again for business or personal reasons at this location. Good customer service is good customer service and I would rather go to the local Costco or Fry's where at least people act like they're happy to see you want your business and will answer your questions politely without making you feel like you're inconveniencing them. Bad bad bad customer service Kneaders shame on you"}
{"text":"Giving Kneaders a solid 2 stars. Sandwiches were kind of pricey for what you get which is a lot of bread. Tasty but really lacked substance as far as the meat is concerned.  4 sandwiches were $38. 2 turkey bacon avocado on foccaia bread and was incredibly too big bread slices and a wee amount of turkey. A chicken pesto panini that was so thin I think there was only 1 slice of chicken to match 1 slice of cheese. The pesto didn't even spread to the crust of the bread. Really disappointing.  The only sandwich that looked filling and worth the price was the chicken salad croissant. Very large portion of chicken salad and then a nice side of lettuce in a cup with some dressing is apparently considered the side salad.  Not so sure that we'd go back. Just really overpriced and have had better sandwiches elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. So hard to choose! The only problem is they run out of their delicious bread loaves by dinner and I always want to bring one home."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed. Ordered only bakery items took them ten minutes to package them. The staff was rude. And the pastries tasted days old."}
{"text":"This place usually isn't one of my go to sandwich spots, but I was craving one of their smoothies so I decided I would give it another try since their food isn't too bad either.   I came in around 2:30 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that I've had before that I enjoyed very much. I ordered it with no mayo, onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them.   I waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while I was in no rush I sipped on the delicious pink piña colada smoothie on this hot summer day. I noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there weren't any filled up by the beverage station. The guy who might have been a manager (since he was wearing a headset) seemed very annoyed that they did that. I agree it was rude to walk back there without asking, but what does he expect when the teas for the customers weren't filled at the beverage station? The man responded to him just saying it'll take 15 minutes to make more. No apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea.   The girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and I politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before I left the place. Unfortunately, the pickle was still in there so I immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because they've left it off multiple times before.   I went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didn't seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that it's a pesto butter and I said that I was aware because I've gotten it before and it didn't look like it was on there. Instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone \"YES!\" And the guy looked back at me and said, \" She said she put it on there.\" I just looked at both of them very confused because I was so surprised of how they handled this.   Just to be clear, I was not upset until I received the worst customer service I could've possibly gotten. I wasn't expecting anything, but just an extra side of the pesto butter, but they just made me feel like I was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so I wasn't preventing them from helping someone else.   I work in the food industry and they clearly could've known that since I was wearing my work uniform, and I deal with people's requests all day long, and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again. This isn't the first time the employees have showed poor customer service, but this is definitely the worst by far.   One star for the smoothie, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service."}
{"text":"Paradise/wildflower ON CRACK!  I ordered a club and my boyfriend ordered the Irish Stew with Irish Soda bread.  I was very impressed with how clean, and fast service was!  My boyfriend takes forever to order, and the girl at the counter was so patient!  Definitely will be coming back & recommending to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"The service, the slowness, the wet bread, and they had me drive off without my drinks. I'm guessing they don't care about yelp reviews because all issues from first visit persisted and it can't be chalked up to newness anymore. Why does the management allow this mediocrity? Like another reviewer, my French dip should have probably just been called Bread."}
{"text":"First I will say that we will never go back. We orderd Rueben sandwiches.  The only good thing was the bread.  I think that they forgot to use pastrami.  It was clearly roast beef.  There is NO mistaking the diffeernce between the two.  In a whole sandwich, there was one very thin layer of meat that did not even cover the whole sandwich.  They forgot to bring out the \"parmesan\" chips.  They finally brought out soggy, tasteless chips  There was absolutely no trace of parmesan anywhere.  ALL of the tables were dirty.  I went and asked if someone could come and clean some tables.  The guy was washing tables and chairs using the same filthy rag.  nasty nasty   This review is for the new location in Avondale."}
{"text":"Kneaders is the BEST!!! Being a Michigan native, I wasn't aware of this place. Not only are the salads unique and great but they have a drive thru too! The wait time can be a little long sometimes but it's totally worth it. If you're new to Arizona, definitely try their salads!"}
{"text":"I visit kneaders quite often and they've always impressed me with their wonderful service. The employees are always very kind a helpful and food is made very efficiently and always tastes delicious. The managers occasionally will come up and ask if you're enjoying everything which is a nice gesture that I appreciate. Not only that there is always free samples by the cash register which is an added bonus! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I placed an order for pickup and planned to go thru drive thru for convenience and was told that I need to come inside to pickup my order since it is a big inconvenience for them to go to another register and get my order and to make payment. Well I am sorry to inconvenience you guys. Will take my inconvenience elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great bread and soups. I like that they have healthy kids meals. Wish they were open Sundays"}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant only has 3 stars! I haven't ever been disappointed with salads or sandwiches. Not to mention their amazing baked goods and bread.   It's not the cheapest sandwich but it certainly is the best quality you'll get in the neighborhood.   If your looking for a cute little gift for a girlfriend be sure to check out their market inside the store.   My favorite salad is the turkey, bacon avocado! The turkey is just like you get on Thanksgiving. Big shredded chunks of breast meat.   My hubby likes to build his own sandwich by picking every individual item he loves. Not to mention plenty of sweets to add to the side."}
{"text":"This place has been very disappointing the last couple of times we have come. The staff is not aware at all of what is on their menu or what is included in certain items. They were also very rude on our visit there today and of course got our order wrong even though it was correct on our receipt. Not sure how that happens. I do not recommend this place as it is way over priced for the lack of quality and service that you will receive. If you are in the mood for good soup and sandwiches you would be better off going to Paradise where at least the food is always consistent and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Our second time here (drivethru) and their sandwiches are amazingly delicious. It's cheap and I order a vegetarian  sandwich and its ONOS!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try Kneaders for lunch. We arrived at 11am and there were 2 customers ahead of us at the order counter, but one of them took 10 minutes to place her order. She peppered the counter person with zillions of questions and held up the line. Kudos for the counter person for not being sharp with her after the first 8 minutes and seeing a line of 12 customers backing up behind the inquisitive (and thoughtless) customer. At minute 9, a second counter person opened a cash register and started taking orders to speed things up.   When my friend and I finally placed our order we both ordered the club sandwich (turkey, roast beef, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressing on a homemade white bread) for $7.99. The sandwich was large and tasty. It does not come with any sides (a dill pickle or small amount of chips would have been nice). They also sell a wide variety of baked goods that looked yummy. The homemade bread selection is extensive. When your sandwich is ready a staff member brings it to your table for you. Beverages are self-serve.  There is also a small boutique merchandise area (sort of a mini Cracker Barrel store idea). The thing that keeps this from being a 4 star experience is the poor customer traffic flow and overcrowding. There is a long line to order your food and even a long line to dump your tray and trash and another long line to exit the building. The line to order and the line to leave the restaurant tend to get jumbled together creating gridlock.  Parking is close to the door. The restaurant is clean and bright and seating is a mix of tables and chairs and booths. They also have a drive-through.  Would we return? We certainly would not attempt it at peak traffic times like lunch."}
{"text":"Went here with for lunch this Memorial Day afternoon with my sister I noticed my meal was rang up wrong on my receipt went to the register to confirm my order and to see if I needed to pay a difference as I waited I watched and overheard three different employees talk about me like I wasn't standing two feet away from the register. I've never felt more humiliated over a sandwich never once was I acknowledged instead just heard the register girl keep muttering things into her mic and laughing. I've worked in customer service for years I've been a manager for many of those years and I'm not sure what kind of training these employees are given but I've never felt more disrespected then today. Don't plan on continuing my business with this company."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or breakfast  As you walk in to Kneaders Bakery and Cafe you can't help but notice the glass cases of delicious looking desserts immediately upon entering the restaurant.  This was my second visit to Kneaders.  The restaurant is clean, comfortable and has many tasty options to choose from. On this visit I ordered the Turkey & Swiss Ranch on sourdough it was delicious.   The sandwiches at Kneaders are huge!  I could only eat half but the half I ate was absolutely delicious. The bread is so soft and the  turkey was moist and flavorful, the perfect sandwich for a quick lunch  The service is wonderful, the staff is very accommodating, and the prices are reasonable. Come to Kneaders hungry, and leave happy!"}
{"text":"HURRAY FOR UNLIMITED FRENCH TOAST!!!!!  I had never been to Kneaders and was stopping to get a haircut nearby and thought I would see what this place is about.   The Native American Girl at the counter deserved 5+ stars for being super nice and friendly and having a great smile that makes breakfast even better! She was the main person who kept taking care of my French Toast refills with an always service with a smile attitude. Seriously, she was great and deserves a raise!   Prices seemed great, awesome value for quality here.   The French toast is unlimited which is happy for a bigger guy like me. It turns out you can only eat so much since they are awesome fresh and thick pieces of tasty goodness that when combined with there super great syrup makes your stomach smile!   The omelette was really good too, but kind of small for a big guy.... Lol...   I really cannot say anything bad about this place and it will now become one of my new favorites when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Killer soup man!  I have only had the soup here, but it is pretty darn good.  The sandwiches look good and my lunch date said they are tasty and fresh.  It's cold today, so I might hit Kneaders tonight for my soup fix.  Yum."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to write this review but I'm so mad and no one is answering the phone. I've called three times and it just rings and rings. The first time I went to Kneaders on Ray, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and thought it was great. I work in Ahwatukee and it was a quick grab through the drive through before heading back to Tempe where I live. I went back the next week for the same order through the drive through. When I got home, they had forgotten the bacon on my Turkey Bacon Avocado. I was bummed. I mean, the bacon is the best part! But I let bygones be bygones. I even went back today. Same order through the drive through. When I got home, I was starving, had the baby in the backseat crying, was struggling with my bags and was ready to eat my sandwich in peace. But they forgot the bacon AND the avocado. I am probably too upset about this. My husband thought I had gotten some terrible news--I was close to tears. I just wanted to call the manager and tell them that that they should tighten up protocol but they didn't answer which made me even more mad, so here I am, not wanting to be mad but fueling it all by writing this review. I guess the moral of the story is check your food when you go through the drive through--but I shouldn't have to peel through the layers, hunting for crucial, delicious parts of a sandwich that are IN THE TITLE OF THE SANDWICH. So I won't be back. I feel a little bit better now. But not much."}
{"text":"Usually enjoy Kneaders but this time they cut the french toast super thick ... like nearly 3 times thicker.  Creates an imbalance between the bread and the exterior goodness.  Brought a bunch of first-timer friends with me also ... breakfast reputation tarnished a bit (both mine and Kneaders)"}
{"text":"We like this place. Other than the food they a little gift shop. Was cool to get some holidays gifts. The menu need some updates.."}
{"text":"Wow, I don't know how this place got great reviews!  I'm a foodie, but the Turkey \"Pesto\"  Panini was absolutely disgusting! I paid almost $9.00 for a sandwich that was completely soggy (except the crust), and their version of \"pesto\" was to place several basil leaves inside the sandwich-which you couldn't eat, as they were steamed and tough.   I was starving, so I looked inside a small bag they gave me with the  sandwich, and there were a few chips. Stale, stale, stale-also unedible. So...for almost $9.00 I threw everything in the trash.  I would almost try it again, but I just don't want to waste any more money. Would NEVER recommend this place. Bummer, I love a good sandwich...."}
{"text":"Tried twice before putting my 2cents.  First, the place feels like you walked into a Grandma's house.  Not a fan of the atmosphere and the surroundings.  The sandwich (roast beef) was very underwhelming.  First, roast beef must be thin and piled on. This was on the thick side and there was hardly any, the bread seams to smother it.  Taste is borderline bland.  Another negative, but I can't confirm this, why the closed on Sunday? If for religious reasons, then please keep your religion out of a public business. Same beef I have with Chick Fillet (although their food Is tasty)."}
{"text":"I like this place. The french toast is so yummy!!! It comes with whipped cream, caramel sauce, and strawberries. It is a must try. Another time I had the sausage, egg, and cheese croissant and that was very good as well. I have not had anything from the lunch menu yet. My husband had the Ruben and he liked it.  I do think they need a better system for getting your order to you because there was an employee going around to every table asking if you were \"Susan\" or \"Bob.\" It was kind of awkward because the trainer was telling the employee what to say right in front of the customer. I felt bad for the poor girl. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I just returned from Kneaders on Indian School and 38 Street. Two days in a row the owner/manager made my salads.  Two days in a row she took the order herself and she made the salads.  It was wrong again!  I would think really hard before eating here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. First time. Ordered the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia bread. The turkey is \"hand pulled\" but only about 2oz. Very meager. The focaccia was 3\" thich. We also ordered a chicken ala  mondo salad. The chicken was flavorful, but the grated cheese looked like the \"pre-grayed\" stuff that has \"celulose\" therefore woos pulp. Didn't notice when we ordered that there was bacon in each meal, which was cold. Would have tasted 100% better had they warmed it up. My husband also ordered a cinnamon roll. Tastier than cinabun, but dry. The bread was the best thing going here. The final disappointment is plastic forks. Ugh. Not a fan.  Don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"Since Kneaders has moved into our neighborhood, we are normally there 2 - 5 times a week!    We LOVE these things about Kneaders: - incredible customer service - loyalty card - especially when they greet me by name with our order, nice touch - menu is fantastic - even though a bakery they thought of vegetarians like me! - desserts = to die for! - always have service with a smile! - bakery is always clean - bread is to DIE FOR! - displays in the gift area are always fun to look at - parking is easy access  LOVE the veggie avocado on rosemary bread.  My daughter LOVES Kneaders and we have gotten away from Subway 24/7!  Had their pumpkin bread yesterday and OMG - you MUST try it!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality of food and service... I just finished an egg, sausage, and cheese on croissant sandwich.  This sandwich was hearty and tasty.  I tried to have something similar at Panera the other day but after 2 poor attempts by Panera's cooking staff at cooking eggs (first eggs way way over cooked, second eggs way undercooked) I gave up!!  I have since blacklisted Panera!!  Kneeders will now be my go-to- particularly for the occasional breakfast sandwich... Well worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Not acceptable. 8 bucks for a croissant and a half cup of filling which is largely celery isn't a good value for anyone's money. I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Three visits now! Still living this place... Friendly, helpful service. Cute, inviting interior with Cracker Barrelesque gifts available for purchase. Ample outdoor seating with parking lot views (could use some potted trees). Oh, and the food, can't forget the food! Their French Toast is fantastic. Thick homemade bread lightly dipped and served with sliced strawberries, whipped butter and caramel syrup--I was told it's unlimited but two slices will fill you up for sure! The breakfast sandwiches come standard in a croissant but we opted for the ciabatta bread and, while a bit big for the egg, bacon and cheese, it was so fresh and soft! So much easier to eat than the tough ciabatta bread at most places. The orange juice tasted fresh-squeezed and was an appropriate $3 versus the $4-6 they charge elsewhere. Took a couple of chocolate chunk cookies to go and they were soft and yummy! We are going back. And soon!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with the reaction from the manager when I told him the lettuce in my salad was old and slimy. He told me that HE was having his worse day ever at work, and what did I want him to do about it? I told him that I simply wanted to inform him. He said, basically, shit happens and do I want him to give me a free meal.  I said no, that that's not what I wanted. I wanted him to know the kitchen was putting out an inferior product. And I walked away, whispering \"if you don't give a shit then why should I?\" I do t think I'll be back. Which is too bad; They have great dessert and breads."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for lunch and little did I know it was going to be one of the WORST experiences I've had as a customer. I went through the drive thru and ordered my sandwich. Once I drove out of the drive thru, I took 1 bite and realized I wanted wheat rather than the frococia bread that it came with. I parked and went in the store. Standing in line, I could see there were only 2 people in the kitchen so I was prepared to wait. Once I got to the register, I politely told the young man at the register \"I just came through the drive thru, and I was wondering if I could change the bread on my Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich to wheat rather than Frococia.\" He asked me to hold on as he went to ask his manager (Josh Tycksen).  While he was telling Josh my request, Josh asked with an attitude \"Did we already give it to her?\" The guy at the register answered \"Yes\" ... Josh then said \"Well, that's how we make it! \"Next time she needs to tell us BEFORE we make it!\" He then rolled his eyes, huffed and puffed, shook his head and gestured with his hand to give him the sandwich. From the line, I could see and hear all of this! I asked Josh \"Is there a problem to change my bread?\" He replied to me, \"No, there isn't a problem, but I have 6 sandwiches ahead of you, so you are gonna have to wait!\" I again politely saod \"That's fine\". I stepped aside and waited for my sandwich.    While waiting I asked the cashier for his name and corporates number. I was given his card, but waa told they had to look for corporate number. Josh then yells to the cashier \"So, does she want whole wheat, honey wheat, what? I ignored him at that time because I was speaking to a young lady who was assisting me with contacting corporate. Rather than this \"manager\" asking ME directly seeing, I am standing right there, he then yells again at the cashier \"I STILL don't know what to do with this TBA for drive they! Is it whole wheat? Or honey wheat?\" Before the young man had the chance to ask me, to then relay it to Josh, I answered and said \" Honey wheat is fine\". He then proceeded to make my sandwich, hands or to the cashier and repeats, \"Tell her next time to tell us BEFORE we make it!\" The cashier began to repeat him, and I replied \"I got it, Thank you\". I walked out livid! Never have I been so embarrassed for simply asking to change my choice of bread. I encourage Josh to learn customer service skills. I will still be sending this to complaint to corporate. This was ridiculous and horrible. Yes, I will still eat at kneaders, but I refuse to return to this particular store. Josh Tycksen needs to be held accountable for his actions."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes in line for a brownie and bread pudding. Ray Road Ahwatukee store. Horrible system. Oh and the piece of bread pudding was small, 1/2 the size of the plastic takeout container. I won't go back. The manager did refund my money so that was nice."}
{"text":"Pricy Clean My bread had no flavor I wasn't too impressed Friendly You can even buy some very nice gifts that were reasonably priced A return...."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love their selection of kids meals, just the right size and always fresh ingredients! Love the grapes and juice box option to reduce the amount of sugar.   Side note: i don't have kids, I order them for myself!"}
{"text":"We so wanted to love Keader's. We've been waiting for them to open for weeks. Hopefully tonight's experience can be chalked up to being very new.   My chicken panini would have been just ok, without too much flavor, but they packed it straight off the press naked into a plastic to go box. Without anything absorbent in there, the bread was soaking wet when I got home to eat. This has got to be just a rookie mistake, right?  The mushroom Brie soup was delicious and the bowl was pretty big too.   The triple cheese cauliflower tasted like mild cheddar and flour. Not terrible by any means, but I was hoping for a little more sophistication.   The chop chicken salad is in my fridge, I'll try it later. Looks fine.   The two soups and salad all came with a side of bread, and after talking options and suggestions with the voice at the drive thru, we came up with three breads to try. Unfortunately the bag at home only contained the ciabatta. Ciabatta is fine but it was the least interesting of the three, and was looking forward to trying a variety of the breads.   This place is RIGHT down the street from my house and open until ten, so I'll probably eventually give them another shot. I really hope tonight's wrinkles have been ironed out by then."}
{"text":"I went to kneaders for their breakfast, which a lot of people don't know about, let me tell you! Their French toast is not only delicious but it feels cooked just right! It doesn't make you feel like you over ate and it's just the right amount of food! And it's also unlimited! Just in case you feel like getting more. My husband got an omelette and he loved it, we now have to try their lunch options, since breakfast was BEYOND amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a second visit to the Kneaders brand but the first visit to this location. The food quality is super and service was consistent. However, on this particular visit I was surprised to learn that the French Toast is unlimited during certain time frames! It is a bit disappointing that Kneaders staff didn't tell me this upon my first visit to Kneaders (where I had French Toast) or that when I ordered the French Toast at this location that I wasn't informed about it, but nonetheless I learned about it when staff walked through the store at the end of the French Toast refill period. Otherwise, the breakfast and coffee was great and so was the atmosphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the veggie avocado. Had to take out the avocado because I was scared of getting food poisoning and quite frankly looks disgusting.. I wish they would just said they didn't have any avocados..  This is the second time they have done this with the avocados. I used to love place this"}
{"text":"Average, especially with other options like Cafe Zupas not so far away.  Food: I ordered the Reuben, which turned out to be quite salty. I ordered it to-go and, unfortunately, didn't discover until I got home that they forgot the thousand island dressing.  Cost: Reasonable.  Service:  The staff were cheerful. The food didn't arrive particularly quickly, but it wasn't an annoyingly long time, either.  Atmosphere: Eh, a bit cramped feeling. A bit like Cracker Barrel but squeezed into what felt like a smaller space.  Overall: It comes back to the food. I'll give Kneaders another try, but this time I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Kneaders really does have very good sandwiches and fresh salads. I enjoy coming here with my grandmother often. However, the employees, basically every single one I have encountered, need a big attitude adjustment. My grandma takes a bit to decide what she wants and I often find it is me who has to guide her through the menu, instead of the cashier doing their job. On two separate occasions, the cashier (a disgruntled looking girl) has looked at the people behind us and opened her eyes widely as if to say \"these people are taking forever!\" Maybe if they did their job and helped people decide, the line could move quicker. This past time, the same girl was cleaning right behind our table but was spraying windex directly onto the windows and we saw bits of the cleaner floating toward where we were eating. After working in the hospitality industry, enduring numerous health inspections, and standards checks, I know that this is a big no no. Probably won't be back to this location which is a shame because I had high hopes. Maybe if the employees go through some manners schooling :)  Also, parking is awful."}
{"text":"I've been to Kneaders many times! They  have delicious sandwiches, soups, desserts, smoothies & fresh squeezed lemonade. Some of my favs are the cafe ham sandwich & the chicken salad sandwich. I love the Guda red pepper soup & the green Chili soup#Green Chile soup! Their berry cheese cake pie is delicious! We ordered a a whole one for Thanksgiving!#Off the chain!   The staff is always great! They remember their customers even if they come through the drive-thru! I love their attention to detail! I went with my family & we went thru the drive-thru & after I placed my order Christine asked, \"Do you want fresh squeezed lemonade\"! My dad & mom laughed & said, \"WOW they know you here\"! Hahahaha.   Bryan & all the other staff members are great! Another time at lunch when I ordered from the drive-thru, & I asked a question to confirm my order, staff member Bryan said, I got you Sista!\" I LOVE it! Hahahaha.   I've even dined in on my lunch break from work and it's so cozy eating lunch inside! With all the Christmas decorations and cozy music, it feels like I'm in a ION movie#\"The Christmas Cruise\", or Hallmark movie! Hahahaha.  Kneaders would have gotten 5 stars but it's been a couple of times where that chicken salad was so bland like it wasn't seasoned at all. I had to put salt & pepper on it & it still wasn't flavorful. It has to be good EVERY time! Other than that, it's a nice place with good food."}
{"text":"Kneaders is a solid spot for sandwiches! I would have preferred if the overhead menu had more details about what is in each sandwich, but they have a smaller menu if you ask for more information.   The sandwiches are very hearty and filling. I could only eat half the sandwich before I was too full. We ordered the French dip with caramelized onions and the turkey artichoke on focaccia. Both were very tasty, but I wish their bread was thinner. I felt like the sandwiches were overwhelmed by the thick slices of bread. I also tried the razzleberry berry smoothie, which was good but a little too sweet.   Otherwise, the sandwiches and smoothies at Kneaders are flavorful and a make good full meal."}
{"text":"Bakery is sooo yummy...food is fresh, service is polite and spot-on.  I came here 3x in one day when I came to visit my daughter.  The French toast is comfort food like no other.  Cinnamon rolls are excellent, bread puddings awesome...love it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. The paninis are all great and the cinnamon bread is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Excellent soup, excellent smoothies, relatively speedy drive-thru, friendly customer service, amazing soup. Everything I have tried there was very satisfying. Breakfast stuff is all amazing and not greasy. Their combos are great. I would go today but they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great little place to come and get some breakfast, I had the Greek omelette! Tasted great employees were nice and even bring your food out to you! I'll be returning shortly."}
{"text":"If Cracker Barrel and Paradise Bakery had a baby, Kneaders would be the result.  Except the food tastes much better! Oh, and a drive-thru.   I met my Mom here just after noon today and it was poppin'! When you first walk in, you will see a variety of home goods (think clocks, aprons, home decor, salt and pepper shakers) much like CB.   And don't even get me started about all the beautiful goodies in that pastry case; had to stop ourselves from buying Key Lime Tarts and Peanut Butter Fudge.   We ordered at the counter. Decided to split a giant Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich on Focaccia, and we each got a cup of the Three Cheese Cauliflower Soup (soup of the day).   Helped ourselves to some Pomegranate Iced Teas and grabbed a seat on the patio.   Just be careful out there on a windy day, the tables are kind of shaky and I managed to pour tea on my dress. Thankfully it dried before going back to work!   I wasn't a huge fan of the soup. Kind of reminded me of Broccoli Cheddar and a little heavy. Needs more cauliflower! My Mom really enjoyed it, though.   The sandwich was what stood out. Love focaccia bread, and these guys didn't disappoint. You could tell the bread was made recently.  Very tender roasted turkey, didn't skimp on the bacon, creamy avocado alongside provolone, crisp lettuce, onion and tomatoes and Kneaders sauce.   No idea what was in the sauce, but it was much better tasting than typical mayonnaise.   To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this Idaho/Utah/Arizona chain and was quite impressed. I'm super stuffed right now, and will be back for a sandwich and some of those pastries."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill :( ordered the turkey avocado salad and the photos show the wilted brown lettuce and brown romaine stem I pulled out of this salad. Bad news as this is the second time in a row I got rotten food from this place. Won't be back."}
{"text":"They have the most awesome BBQ chicken salad and Classic Club ... if given the choice between Panera Bread and Kneaders ... this girls scale would definitely tip in the direction of the neatest Kneaders local on the real!.. the salads are packed with toppings and are huge in size as well as the sandwiches ... and they always leave me with huge portions left over  You have got to give them a try ! I gave them a four  star because of the pricing average is $10 which is a bit much ...  They don't have much in the way of coupons or discounts ... which could really take them a long way in return customers  But this lady will definitely break a piggy bank to come back   In addition to my previous review.. I read a lot of others and honestly some of the ones showing browned avocado or wilted lettuce or sweated sandwiches ... sounds like u have a classic case of shouldn't have waited to get home in this Arizona heat to eat ur meat!... those pics look like food that sat in the car .. not food that was eaten right away !  I have been coming here for over a year and they have always been spot on ! And when they haven't been they have been quick to fix! Try em'"}
{"text":"Good fresh bread  Enjoy breakfast and lunch visit as much as I can .. Very delishious"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chicken salad on croissant. Restaurant wasn't crowded or loud during lunch either. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident...volleyball tournament a few hours away from home. We split an excellent, fresh turkey sandwich with amazing bread. Then we noted they had breakfast sandwiches for next time... and they had a location close to home. We are now regulars and love the \"made to order\" quality that we get every time. Employees are friendly and above the normal bar. Our Scottsdale location gives the impression of \"family owned\" and we appreciate them."}
{"text":"Customer service is great, food is great. Turkey bacon avocado sandwich sometimes looks like the lettuce is bad though, breakfast is always tasty."}
{"text":"I like that this place has a drive-through, it can be difficult to find places with healthy choices and a drive through. That being said, this place is disappointing.   They used to have several vegetarian options. I don't know why they changed their menu but now they have three: a veggie avocado salad, a veggie avocado sandwich (so if the salad doesn't appeal to you, put it on bread? The addition of bread is literally the only difference and it's a boring salad to begin with) and usually one soup. It should be noted though that the servers don't typically know what's in the soups as they have suggested on more than one occasion their baked potato soup that is packed with bacon as a vegetarian option.   They also nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. For example, I ordered a kids meal and asked that they substitute turkey for ham. They obliged but charged me $1.50 without telling me. When I asked they said that the turkey was more labor intensive so they had to charge more--ok, but why wouldn't you tell me when I ordered, and if the turkey is so much better, what's wrong with the ham? They asked what drink I want with the meal, I asked for juice and they asked me what kind. I said orange and they said that it will be $.20 extra. The only juice that came with the meal is apple. THEN WHY DID THEY ASK WHAT KIND I WANT? The kids meal comes with a cookie, I asked for chocolate chip. They said I can't pick the cookie unless I want to pay the difference. I am not trying to get anything for free, but they try to upsell you at every opportunity.  My kids did like the turkey sandwich meal, and it is enough food for two toddlers to share. I appreciate that they offer fruit as a side and their bread is really good."}
{"text":"I wanted to order the chicken chop salad with out the almonds but the person at the register told me it was already made and the ingredients could not be taken off.  Needless to say looking at the menu online now it stats made fresh, and the the chop salad does not have almonds despite what the person told me.  Well, my wife and I both got a half sandwich.  I got the turkey and unfortunately the most flavorful part was the tomato. My wife got the roast beef.  She said the roast beef was good but the whole sandwich was just blah We got out daughter the kids meal.  The grilled cheese was one slice of bread folded in half, not a whole sandwich.  There was also a fruit selection which we choose the grapes assuming they were fresh, well they were prepackaged, not what we were expecting from a place which serves fresh fruit bowls. Overall though the kids meal was plenty of food for the money. That is more than I could say for the half sandwiches.  We wanted to like this place since one opened up right down the street from us but we were disappointed. I also would have liked to tell the manager but no one stopped at out table to ask.  We had a runner and what I assume, from the different shirt, a manager walk by our table multiple time but they almost avoided eye contact and did not ask about our meal."}
{"text":"The friendliest staff ever! They are so nice and helpful and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the chicken panini and it was so Good! Perfectly cooked, fresh and filling. I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service I would definitely recommend my friends and family to go eat and they have all you can eat French Toast"}
{"text":"Very expensive! Lots of bread..little meat!! I only went here because it had a drive thru and i had my dog with me..i won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy with all kinds of expensive homemade pastries.  It smells heavenly in here and everyone is very polite."}
{"text":"No complaints on the food. I'll go back for the soups and sandwiches. But the customer service sucked. I waited a long time in the drive thru just for them to forget my soup. Had to go into the store to get the missing item. Got home and noticed they forgot the cookie in my daughter's kid's meal. If I'm paying $16+ for two meals, I'd like to receive all my items in my order."}
{"text":"Kudos to Kneaders! This was my first time here and my experience was great! I ordered the avocado salad with sour dough bread. The bread was nice and soft and the salad was so fresh. I can't wait to make a stop back in and try the breakfast.  Shout out to kneaders for having great customer service and a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant so much.  I went on opening weekend and several times since then. Its tough to find a place with a drive through thats fast, that isn't gross. I wanted to like them, but I cant.  I do have positive and negative.   Pros: they do have delicious bread. Flavorful, fresh and lovely. Makes for a good foundation for a sandwich. Its always been very clean. They don't skimp on avocado, that makes me happy. Avocado is tasty. Good iced tea too.   Cons: I asked several people if any of their soups were vegetarian friendly. I was reassured by 4 separate people that they were, 2 bites and a queasy stomach cramp later I learned they are not. I brought it to the attention of the manager and was told that none of the soups are vegetarian and given a half heart felt sorry. I had to ask them to refund me for the soup I couldn't even eat.  It didn't occur to them that this would be the best course of action. Their menu is limited in its flexibility and my attempts to customize to meet my veggie needs are only successful half the time. I have to bring my food back a lot to be remade after meat was on my sandwich or in my salad anyway.    The value of what you get versus what you pay isn't the best, but Im sure for many this is a great place to go, just not for me."}
{"text":"Turkey bacon avocado was great. Focaccia bread was on point! So fresh n soft and was pretty filling.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love their Greek Omelette. Coffee is tasty and baked goods are reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"First thing, I love Kneaders & their food (even though a full meal can be pricey - $15+/per person) but I was a little disappointed, my first experience I purchased a Veg/Avocado Salad; since the lettuce wasn't cut too well, I decided to bring it home for later. Later as I'm cutting the salad, I find unwashed lettuce/bugs in my salad  I call the store, and was told (Shamrock) wasn't sending good produce, but unfortunately that wasn't the truth (I work with a restaurant in Ahwatukee that also orders from Shamrock, and we've never served dirty salads) but they apologized and offered a free entree to make up for the food I purchased. Gosshhhhhh, did they do just that! Their Grilled Cheese's are amazing! And the Lemon Muffin top? Kaoulsh? I'm not sure but they're delicious ...please Kneaders, take the extra moment to check/clean your produce, I'll eat your food either way - because it's so delicious but I probably wouldn't order a salad again..."}
{"text":"Best French toast on the planet. No lies. Fantastic baked goods. Great salads and sandwiches. Prompt friendly service. I never had anything here I didn't like. Did I mention the French toast? Amazing. I just wish Kneaders could have moved to Flagstaff with me."}
{"text":"I have gone twice while in the area shopping. I was excited to try as I'm always up for fresh food! The parking lot is very crowded probably mostly due to the winter population here.. I decided to go through the drive-through as there was no parking! That was hard as I am not familiar with the food... I ended up with a salad which was pretty good but I guess that's not what they specialize in being a bakery... Next time I went back I went in.... Big mistake. It is so busy in there and very LOUD! I didn't have time nor the patience to really study the menu as I just wanted to get food and get out! If I do go back I will wait until the snowbirds leave and the traffic both in lot and inside dies down.... Disappointed"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  The breakfast sandwiches are very satisfying.  Service is great even when the place is crowded, which it has been every time I've visited."}
{"text":"I've been to Kneaders many times for lunch. Their soups are all very good. You can get it in a bread bowl or with a slice of bread (many to choose from).   Today I had the black bean with avocado. I was a little disappointed at the 2 small slivers of avocado, but the soup was delicious. My absolute favorite soup is the Kickin' Chicken Enchilada.   Their sweet breads are all delicious! You'll pass by the tempting pastry display on your way to the register. Everything looks so good!  They always have samples of their breads at the register. Yum!  I've only had their breakfast once. It was an egg sandwich, which was a good size, but I thought it was a little too greasy. Their coffee was good. They offer an all you can eat French toast that I hope to try sometime soon.   One of The best thing about Kneaders is that you can get quality food in a drive through. This makes it nice when you have little ones that you don't want to get out of the car. Speaking of kids, they have a grilled cheese kids meal that my kids love.   Kudos to them for being closed on each Sunday to give their employees a day off."}
{"text":"The best thing about Kneader's is that they have all you can eat French Toast or Pancakes for only $5.95!!!  I've only tried the French toast, the bread is thick and delicious! Their syrup is super tasty and mouth watering.  You just tell them you want a refill of the French toast and they'll keep bringing you more.    This offer is only until 10am.  I've also tried the Greek Omelet and it was really good but it was so small. I think it was just one egg omelette. Only if it was the size of the French toast!"}
{"text":"Nothing too special.  This place has been popping up everywhere in Arizona, so I thought I'd give it a try. When you walk in, it feels just like a Panera. You order at the counter as you pass through the rows or breads and the dessert cases then find yourself a seat in one of the booths/tables. They bring out the food for you if you choose to stay to eat.   I ordered the Turkey and Artichoke Focaccia Panini. It came with some chips and a sliced pickle. It was pretty good, but nothing special. Nothing I wouldn't think I could make at home.   The service was nice and fast. The tables and restaurant was clean. I recommend this place for a quick, reasonably priced lunch.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"I was craving a salad one night and this happened to be the closest place that was still open. Not terrible, but I probably won't be coming back simply because I feel like the ratio to what you pay and what you actually get is a little high. In other words, their salads are kind of pricy. I'd much rather go somewhere else for the cost of what their salads here cost, even if they were good. I had the BBQ chicken salad and it wasn't bad at all, but like I said, I would just rather go somewhere else for the money."}
{"text":"Service was fast and staff was extremely friendly. Stopped by here for breakfast. Honestly didn't know that it served breakfast. If you want something quick and yummy I'd recommend. Not a lot of selection for breakfast but they've got your staples: oatmeal, french toast, omelettes, etc."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Labor Day. Best French toast I've had in a while. Lots of pastries available on display. Wish I had room in my stomach for it. Pancakes were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's up with all the bad reviews... second time iv been been here and it's really good.  Came later in the day around 3pm for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the turkey artichoke panini. Workers seemed very friendly.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely great!  The negative issue I experienced was the manager had unfairly put a gal on the register on her 1st day on the job without anyone shadowing her.  She was very nice but unable to answer the questions re: different sandwiches & salads.  This was during a lunch hour rush. The manager got in involved & was rather rude.  I then noticed he took the gal off the register & had her cleaning tables & emptying trash.  I addressed this with him & he said the company does not allow for \"shadowing\".  I informed him he was not fair to the new employee & told him to give her a chance. He assured me he would.  He did apologize for the whole scene which I'm grateful for.  I also spoke to the employee & assured her I was not upset or  angry with her but rather her manager.  My advice to her was to not let a manager bully her.  I hope higher management reads this & re- thinks orientation for new employees.  The management in the Tucson office is run far better than what I witnessed in Chandler.  I accepted the manager's apology & would return to this location when I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss, it is the Cracker Barrel of fast casual bakeries.  I highly recommend their bread but their other bakery cases items do not taste home made, more frozen then thawed.  I love getting their Paesano bread, its like a sour dough with out the bitey sour.  It is my go to bread to make grilled cheese sandwiches and freezes very well so you don't have to hurry and use a loaf.  Their Hazelnut 12 Grain bread is Ah-Maz-ing but at a $6 price tag, is not a loaf I order often.  Come in early because they do clearance day old bread at the rack by the register.  Menu items are hit and miss.  I love the turkey bacon avocado salad but the bacon is pre-cooked bacon and sometimes the turkey portions, although large, are fatty and stringy pieces from the breast bone.  Some soups are good but rotate, are seasonal, or run out quickly and are substituted  Kneaders is on my list of places with amazing ranch dressing, you laugh but the ranch list is a real thing.  The reason for a less than stellar review is consistency.  Sometimes I have a great meal, other times quality is lacking.  Sometimes I get a decent sized piece of pie, other times it is a sliver.  Sometimes my slice of Triple Chocolate Cream pie comes with a crust, other times the server left it in the pie tin.   I also try to call ahead to check on bread items being in stock (learned my lesson after getting stuck in the drive through for 15 min when they ran out of bread) but no one answers the phone.  They offer online ordering but what is the point of ordering online, driving there, and finding out they were out because no one can answer the phone.  This place is good when its good but I never know what I am going to get."}
{"text":"Healthier style fast food. Fresh breads and pastries. Great sandwiches and salads. I don't think you can go wrong. Plus, there is a drive thru. On top of all that, they're open until 10pm, which helps for later cravings. Good smoothies and a breakfast menu too. Super clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went to Kneaders with a class from my school and it was a solid 3 star experience. The restaurant was very accommodating to the students I was with and the service was very friendly. I had the potato soup and it was decent, a little on the salty side, but not bad. The breads I tried were also fine, but nothing super special. I would come back to this place for a quick lunch if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I don't know what all this crazy talk about Kneaders being better than Paradise Bakery is but I think not! Not only did they mess up our order and not give us everything we paid for, the sandwich I got was no where near as good as Wildflower, Paradise or even Jason's Deli! The chicken pesto panini was so bland and lacking flavor that I didn't even eat it. The chicken was just a thin piece of flavorless meat that didn't even cover the length and width of the bread. Next time I'll just go somewhere that I know instead of coming here again.  I'm afraid to try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Ok so we went back to Kneaders a couple of nights ago for a cookie to treat my kids before heading home. We arrived a little after 9 pm and was greeted by this discontented woman that looked so perturbed that we would do something so awful as to have her take an order. We had some of our cookie and then my son was having a hissy fit so we left in a hurry and I didn't have ample time to clean up the few crumbs that we had left. As I was entering my car with my kids, I see the grumpy lady through the window go over to our table to sweep up our mess as she looks up at me and shakes her head back and forth at me as to scold me for leaving a mess!  I've never seen such blatant disrespect towards a customer. We are done with this place. She won't have to clean up after us ever again."}
{"text":"Quick review. Got the Club sandwich, which was pretty good, but there's no way they should call the bread Sourdough. It in no way tastes like Sourdough, but was fresh. Also, ordered my food and another family that ordered food after me got theirs first. Also, there was a worker that was getting off her shift and also had her food made before my order. All the workers were really nice and polite, but won't be going back again.  Have heard the same complaints about service from that place and should've listened."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I have lived in the \"bubble\" aka Ahwatukee for 21 plus years...I was hoping for a GREAT breakfast, lunch...community feel restaurant....it is corporate ALL the way...yuck. Pricey, lousy coffee, and here we go...sandwiches. Are there not enough sandwich joints yet? I went during breakfast and instead of muffins and pastries...it was cake..cookies...heavy desserts...sorry guys...you missed the mark with me."}
{"text":"Lots of good pastry choices here - bread pudding, fruit tarts, cinnamon rolls, cookies, cupcakes, and the like. But very few other choices for breakfast. Two breakfast sammies, three scramble egg omelettes, pancakes, and french toast. The french toast did look amazing though. Eggs were a bit dry but BUT but they did get my confused order correct, which I truly appreciate. Coffee was out when we arrived, they were brewing new (9:30am) but not too much of a problem. Very understaffed for as busy as they were this morning - slowing ordering and service down a bit. Interestingly, the toast is only toasted on one side. I have never seen that before. I would maybe stop in here again but probably only for sweets."}
{"text":"First time visit at Kneaders! Went in for breakfast but saw a Thai Salad, so naturally went for that! It was a good portion and dressing was delicious! It had the peanut-flavor to it and a little hint of spice which I love! Staff was very welcoming. Would definitely go back for another salad!"}
{"text":"we tried Kneaders two times, both times not impressed. Soggy bread, uncooked pastries, we will not go back. Service was \"directive instead of suggestive\" the clients that were there each time were more interested in our conversations then keeping to themselves while we were eating.  If I even get a weak moment and try it again I will re-review."}
{"text":"great food and soup pastries and bread are real good been to queen creek location and always satisfied."}
