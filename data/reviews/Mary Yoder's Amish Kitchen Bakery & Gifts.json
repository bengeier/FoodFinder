{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  Some time ago I lived in the Cleveland area for a few years, and while there had the good fortune to become familiar with Yoder's, located about an hour to the east of the metro area in the heart of a charming, substantial though happily unpublicized Amish community.  Now living in another state, on my infrequent visits to Cleveland (especially when driving in from the east) I often try to return to Yoder's for lunch or dinner.  I find that it has consistently offered wholesome selections whether from the menu or from the buffet.  Non-buffet dishes are quite generous in size, too!  The basic though tasty meat-and-potatoes food with its high quality and ample portions is the primary draw.  A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit.  Baked goods of a wide variety are also available for dessert to cap the experience.  The current facility (a larger, more modern site than the original) is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business.  The gift shop that you must pass through at length on the way in and out offers a nice inventory of things to look at and browse through.  I look forward to future but sadly infrequent visits to Yoder's!"}
{"text":"WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced. 14.99 for a turkey dinner that was bland and tough. The bathroom was dirty. Probably hadn't been cleaned/checked for hours. Server wasn't pleasant at all. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I chose to rate Mary Yoder's \"Amish\" Kitchen a two because Mary might be a tad distressed to see her name attached to this restaurant. 
First of all I've never had to follow so many rules just to eat. Don't substitute that, don't share that, can't eat that with that. I thought the Amish were a peaceful people but I was afraid I'd be taken out in irons if I didn't follow the rules.
Many dishes are not homemade and the turkey was a processed breast brought to the restaurant. Veggie burger was boxy burger.  The cost seems high for food that is not all homemade. 
Now, I had the homemade chicken salad on homemade bread and the bread and chicken salad was very tasty. The rolls and apple butter are also good. If indeed it was all homemade then that was some decent fare. Mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were good and were also advertised as home made. 
The place was clean and the staff was friendly. I just am not sure the prices and hype justify the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in during a recent trip through Middlefield, and we loved every bite. I had the noodles over mashed potatoes (with beef) -- insanely good and exactly the kind of comfort food I wish I had all the time! Boyfriend had the chicken (which he devoured), and then we ordered this insanely decadent apple dumpling pie for dessert. Will definitely stop again when we are back in northeast Ohio!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Ohio, I've experienced authentic Amish food several times. I moved to Florida in 1997 and on a return visit in 2010, I took my southern wife. She was ecstatic having never met an Amish family before, but more surprising to me was how well she enjoyed the food. Southern women are amazing cooks, and she was impressed. The serving staff was friendly and helpful and made the experience authentic. Although it took over an hour to get to, it is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Took my visiting family from Florida to experience Amish food at Mary Yoder's, and was totally embarrassed at how awful the lunch buffet was.  Nothing tasted fresh and the selection was horrible.  I don't believe for a second that this was actual prepared food by the Amish.  It tasted like something that would come from some kind of cheap food service and heated up to be put out for consumption.  The service was good, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  :("}
{"text":"We are new to the area and decided to seek out an Amish breakfast.  After a 45 minute drive, we were very disappointed.  The food may be great.  But because our group has limited mobility, we weren't able to find out.  

Whoever designed this restaurant gave no thought at all to making it accessible.  Although you can pull right up to the building and see people eating just inside, you need to enter through the bakery on the far right and wind through the tourist shop before getting anywhere near the only entrance to the restaurant.  Total distance from a handicapped parking spot to a table exceeds the length of a very long city block.  To make matters worse, there are not even any benches along the long path one is forced to follow.  

Good Amish food tends to attract an older crowd.  But unless you are in a wheelchair, you better expect a long hike in order to even give the food a try.  So we bought some very good cookies, and used them to tide us over while we used Yelp to find another nearby Amish restaurant.  What was Mary Yoder's builder thinking?"}
{"text":"Great food, but way overpriced , American girls dressed in Amish girl outfits, management are really arrogant and unprofessional .  Closed on Sundays.  Not impressed.   Way overpriced gift shop, the whole place is a rip off"}
{"text":"A nice local diner. The meat is all so tender. The mashed potatoes taste like creamy real potatoes and the Mac n cheese is creamy.

**Update they need to fix the checkout process. Had to wait some 20 minutes while the queue of old people all paid and picked bakery items. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"A noon drive to Middlefield, Ohio, the fourth largest Amish community in the world had us dining at Mary Yoder's on portions big enough to serve as dinner tonight, too. Our ham and pork chop dinners were good and the service swift. We ordered a slice of red grape pie and a slice of bumbleberry pie to share. We both agreed that the grape sang a prettier tune on the palate! As my husband let me steal his grape portion, to make amends I bought a grape pie for home. Warning! The bill must be paid at the same registers used for the bakery and gift shop, which may take at least 10 minutes and could be longer at busy times as the clerks wrap gifts and bakery. Tedious!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here, coming on the recommendation of my brother/sister-in-law.  I was not disappointed.  Although I opted out of the many choices on the menu for the salad bar, it was well-stocked with fresh salad fixings.  There were choices for chicken and roast beef, along with mashed potatoes (real, not faked), green beans and noodles.  Everything was good.  Service excellent and attentive.

As a bonus, every Tuesday in February is buy one/get one free."}
{"text":"Great food!  Be sure to get the salad bar, which can be added as a sidedish with any entree or sandwich.  The various salads on offer there (cranberry, carrot, jello, fruits, potato, and others I had never seen before) are really good.

Everything served there tastes very fresh and is made by the Amish ladies in the kitchen!  You can get soup (vegetable, chili, noodle, or soup of day) and salad bar for dinner, with free refills on soup and salad!

One in my party got meatloaf and the portion was huge!  The chili is awesome.  Waitresses are very friendly and will answer your questions about the Amish.  :)

I love this place and make a point to eat there whenever I visit Northeastern Ohio."}
{"text":"We were disappointed in the food and service. We haven't been to Mary Yoders for a couple years.  They weren't really busy, but service was slow. Food was expensive and not as good as we hoped. The buffet was $14.99 per person, but we don't eat huge amounts of food and the selections did not look appetizing.  We ordered hot roast beef and meatloaf sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy and iced tea. Our bill was $32!  We don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"5 star all the way. Good service, Hardy servings, of delicious Amish made favorites. 
Save room for a piece of fresh made pie!"}
{"text":"The waitress was super nice. She is the reason I gave 2 stars.   The salad bar was decent.  The hot buffet was not very good.  The oven fried chicken was super dry and the food overall was pretty bland.  We would definitely not come back for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed. I thought this was going to be good home cooked food and it wasn't. The gravy that covers everything tasted like it was from a can. My food came slightly Luke warm. I won't be back here.  The service was very slow. The server pushed hard for us to get the buffet. But we didn't"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Amish country. The service is great and the food is good. Not amazing, but good. If you are craving a home cooked meal this is the place to go. I recommend getting pie for desert! It is always delicious!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave this place 10 stars ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC

We visited a few weeks ago on a Tuesday. The host and hostess were acting strange as there was some type of accident in the ladies room and the teenagers were acting like teenagers, but I did feel it was not appropriate in front of guests.

the waitress was fast and efficient which was lovely as you don't often see that with teens these days.

Now on to the food. Our table ordered the roast beef and the meatloaf open faced sandwiches which were delicious. The bread was great and the portions huge, tasty and more than reasonably priced. 

For me the star of the show if their famous peanut butter spread. I even bought some to transport all the way home with me because I just couldn't imagine not having it. For my husband, the star was the huge fresh coconut cream pie served with fresh whipped cream on top instead of yucky mereinge.

If you are in the area of feel like driving for a fantastic meal, then do not pass Mary Yoder's place by. I can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"I've been looking for an excuse to visit this restaurant and today was the day. I'm glad I did. Although they did not have a lunch portion of the chicken I couldn't leave without giving the dinner a test run. Delicious. Breaded and baked not fried. Very moist. Corn bread muffins were great and I enjoyed sizeable portions of homemade mac and cheese and applesauce. No way there was room for dessert. Maybe next time. The gift shop was a bit cheesy and I had hoped for more food items like I've seen in other places. All in all a great experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"Being from a small farming town in Indiana, sometimes I just really want comfort food. This delivered. It smells delicious inside and the dining room reminds me of going out to lunch with my grandparents. The service was pleasant and quick and the food was warm and delicious. The rolls and gravy were homemade. It's not fancy, trendy, inventive, or necessarily healthy, but it was just what I was looking for on a cold spring day."}
{"text":"Really large portions. Great service. Food was good but not great. I had the special, cream chicken over biscuits with green peas. My husband had the turkey with stuffing and mashed potatoes.  Comfort food all around. Coconut cream pie and pecan pie for dessert were both very good. The rolls brought with lunch were very good as well."}
{"text":"Well you are in the middle of Amish Country so if this your first time to experience Amish cooking you could somewhat be wow'd by this restaurant I give them 2 stars for the breakfast they hands down win the best breakfast in Middlefield in terms of the full country breakfast I think they are a little over commercialized to be called authentic Amish cooking however it is an impressive venue with the Amish bakery and store inside but lacks real home style cooking.

In my opinion this is carbohydrate overload at it's best and over indulgence is the draw for many. I think it's very difficult to have quantity and quality in the same package and this is my issue with Mary Yoder's they have some how convince themselves that more is better so I agree with some of the other reviews that boxed gravies, and processed meat replaces the advertised idea the name implies. As many times as I've eaten breakfast here and a few times for lunch I have never once seen a horse and buggy tied up outside or an Amish family feasting on the fare the intent is to attract tourists and in saying that mission accomplished. I think traveling south to Holmes County around Millersburg is required to get he full Amish experience."}
{"text":"It was my very first time in Amish country so my friends had to take me to Mary Yoder's for their breakfast buffet.  I wanted to try so many things on the menu and this was a great way for me to do that.  When we walked in there is a whole gift shop, store and bakery inside the restaurant.  It is really cute and stocked full of Amish treats, candies and pies.  I bought a few of their jams to take home and I love them.  They really have a interesting mix of items you can buy.

The breakfast buffet was awesome!! They had a little of everything... homemade biscuits and gravy (huge fluffy and delicious and the gravy was really good as well), eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, pancakes, waffles, muffins, potatoes, fruits, and cakes.  It was a lot and I had to try everything, lol!  I really enjoyed it and it was a real treat for me because I NEVER get to eat like this so I really pigged out and it was totally worth it.  If I come back I will have to make sure to come back for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Cool place, but the food can be bland.  The best thing I've had there other than the pies and rolls was the Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Pork chops not as big as they used to be and more grease.  Service was good.  Hot fudge sundae was good also.  Will be back to enjoy the town again and try other meals."}
{"text":"This was definitely a touristy spot. When you first walk in you have to pass through a rather extensive Amish gift shop in order to get to the restaurant. The service was pretty good, and the food was fine (think mom's home cooking). They allow you to order off a menu or just do the buffet - we opted for the buffet. It's a pretty good value, but foodies will probably be disappointed in the rather bland selection."}
{"text":"I wanted to update and say 2 years later and I still love Mary Yoder's! We stopped I. Today and had their buffet lunch and it was so yummy. You cannot beat their home cooked goodness. I had the most wonderful plate of mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans and roast beef. I ate way more than I should have but it was delicious. I highly recommend a good family meal here if you are in the area. You won't be sorry! But try and save room for dessert! I skipped it today and now and sad! Ha ha ha"}
{"text":"Maybe I went here with too high of an expectation.  I was very excited when I walked in and saw the huge dining room and it looked like a place that would serve delicious comfort food.

Then I saw the salad bar.  ICEBERG LETTUCE.  That set the stage for how the whole rest of the meal went, honestly.  

I had been looking forward to the sald bar anyways so I still got it as one of my sides for my dinner entree.  The potato salad and broccoli salad were very good.  My sister had to dig at the bottom for the dredges of the broccoli salad as they did not fill it after numerous people had their portion, however.  The rest of the salad bar was just ok.  Nothing spectacular, and again, iceberg lettuce was the only option.  Not that great for what they charge for it.  

My sister and aunt chose the soup and salad option as their meal, and after they had finished their salads and were waiting patiently for the soup to come out, the waitress informed them that they were evidently out of the chicken noodle soup they ordered and she wasn't aware until she was just about to serve it.  My aunt substituted the vegetable soup and said it was lacking something, she didn't finish it but the waitress kindly said she'd take it off the bill since she didn't enjoy/finish it.  My sister just went back to dig up what was left from the salad bar.

I got the sampler platter as my dinner with a side of the homemade macaroni and cheese.  The macaroni and cheese was good, but I think it was lacking a little something as well.  All our food was served lukewarm.  The chicken was the best part, moist and delicious.  The ham was served wtih a pineapple glaze, and tasted pretty standard.  The roast beef was not very good and I barely ate any of it.  Not BAD but just no good flavor.  

The pie was delicous, I enjoyed the peanut butter chocolate cream pie and yummy crust.  But that was the best part of all of our meals.

The next time I'd want to go a ways out to get my dinner I'm just going to go somewhere else.  This was not worth the trip."}
{"text":"While in a part of the area filled with Amish and Yoder one (stereotypically I will admit) would assume this food would be delicious and filling. 
However this is not the case. 

The buffet looked like cafeteria food and ordering off the menu proved incredibly expensive for a lunch that tasted like Stouffers.  

Bottom line do not even pull in - not even for the bakery.  Drive around until you see a true Yoder or Amish establishment or pie stand and you shall be better served both in tummy and wallet."}
{"text":"I came upon this place during a little cruise around Middlefield to check out small town living... no really... I decided to go for a drive and see how the small towns lived.  When I saw some horse & buggies hitched at the back of the parking lot, I knew I had to check this place out.

It has the feel of a small town family restaurant, well, I guess it is a small town family restaurant.  I didn't see many Amish people in here, but the employees are dressed in the Amish garb.  Not sure if they are in fact Amish, but it adds to the novelty.

I had the chicken salad and soup combo.  Although it was satisfactory, it wasn't anything spectacular.  I think people go here for the buffet and salad bar.

There is an attached gift shop that has some cute, yet tacky, things.  The candle selection is pretty great.  I doubt I'll ever be back in Middlefield, but if I was I would probably stop in here again."}
{"text":"This definitely did not live up to the hype that everyone in my party was saying.

Ordered off the menu. Had roast pork, mashed potatoes, and green beans. Pork was good, lots of flavor and tender.  Potatoes were gluey. Green beans were CANNED. Really? 

My friends had meatloaf, carrots, fried chicken. Nothing looked special. 

Service was fine. She was very friendly.

Ordered strawberry rhubarb pie to go. Very disappointing. Crust tasted mushy and commercial. The filling was nothing special. 

Everything was OK, but nothing stood out. 

Buffet looked acceptable, but didn't entice me."}
{"text":"I grew up 15 mins away from here, and I must say you can't beat the food! Get the family meal, and you get plates of meat, sides, and all you can eat pies, salad bar, and side dish bar!!! It's all home made, the place IS Amish run, and they even have a gift shop!"}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant a few tries, thinking that maybe the first or second time was a fluke.  I have found, however, that it just isn't all that good.  It's perfectly clean and the servers are nice enough, but I have never left thinking \"wow, I certainly have to come back next week!\"  

I have tried many different options and really have never been satisfied...
I came for the breakfast buffet, but was disappointed by the large amount of foods that seemed to be boxed or frozen and not homemade like the \"Amish kitchen\" in the name suggests. 
 
I have tried the dinner buffet and salad bar, and I think that the only draw behind that is that you can go up as many times as you please.  Personally, I only wanted to go up one time as the chicken I selected was raw and that kind of decreased my appetite.

I recently tried just ordering a dinner from the menu, thinking that perhaps the buffets were not the strong suit of the restaurant.... Friends of mine ordered the \"dinner special\" which was swiss steak that came with the salad bar and a piece of pie for dessert.  They were later informed that they were out of the swiss steak so they had to pick something else.  I ordered the turkey dinner with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes... they were out of mac and cheese.  I ordered the chicken noodles instead.  My dinner came out with everything on the plate completely covered in a canned gravy, and everything was the same bland color.  The turkey was ok, the potatoes were delicious, but the noodles tasted like nothing at all.  They had no flavor AT ALL.  The only person who was really happy with his dinner was my boyfriend who had meatloaf and fried potatoes (it was a monstrous serving and he licked his plate).  The waitress was very apologetic for all of the things they were out of and gave us all a piece of pie on the house for the troubles.  The friends who ordered the swiss steak each ordered strawberry rhubarb pie... there was only one piece left.  It seemed like we couldn't win!  I had the \"fresh\" peach pie.  It didn't taste like any fresh peaches I have ever had... the crust was delicious but the filling was not.  

The biggest plus of the restaurant is the fresh rolls that are brought out to the table along with the apple butter and peanut butter spread.  Absolutely delish! I have bought both the butter and spread in the store on the way out so I could enjoy them at home without having to come in to the restaurant and have a subpar meal just to enjoy these treats"}
{"text":"Came in walked past the great smelling bakery and got in line for the restaurant my person order the chicken tenders and Mac and cheese the chicken was crisp on the out side and moist on the inside the Mac and cheese was creamy and good I order the chile and it was good not at all spicy and then came the meatloaf it had to me 2lbs I took a bit of it and instantly reminded me of my grandma it was moist and hardy them mash potatoes was good to and I am not a gravy person but the gravy was awesome I will be back worth the trip"}
{"text":"Happy wife, happy life! The only reason I dine here is my wife likes the baked chicken. As for me, the food is mediocre at best & often lukewarm. Service is inconsistent. The salad bar is no better than what you would find at any 3-star sit-down restaurant, maybe even a little worse. Everything is overpriced. 20+ years ago, you would have waited 20 to 30 minutes in line for a table & been glad to do it. Now it's nothing more than a tourist trap with a 2nd rate cafeteria attached."}
{"text":"I don't know why they have all these nagative reviews. I have been coming here everytime I'm in middlefield since i was a kid.  The food still taste the same...a good home cooked meal.  After i get done eating i enjoy looking at all the gifts they have there. I've taken some friends there through the years and they always enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have been to Amish areas of Indiana, PA, and now Ohio.. and this has to be the worst Amish Restaurant I have ever been to..  the fried chicken was shake n bake coating.. very soggy coating and the chicken was dried out..  there was no flavor to the dressing and noodles were in an unflavored broth.  The salad bar was not very fresh and not well kept."}
{"text":"Very overrated, overpriced, and more of a tourist attraction than a good, quality restaurant. I give two stars because the baked goods sold in the connected shop are very good!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for lunch. Had the warm buffet and salad bar. The food was delicious and tasty. Service was excellent and friendly.I definitely look forward to returning here again, for more. The desserts are awesome. A great Amish bakery area as well. Take some of those baked goods to go."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, especially when I heard about the pies.

Being an urban dweller, I thought this place out in the country that boasts Amish cooking would be a true \"farm to table\" experience.  Instead, it was institutional food.  This is what you will be eating if you don't plan for your retirement.

My first clue should have been the huge parking lot with not a single horse or carraige.  Like going to a Chinese restaurant full of non-Asians, this is not a good sign.

Upon entry, you are in the bakery section.  I was disappointed to see grocery store bakery style frosted sugar cookies in Hallowe'en shapes, but they turned out to be the only seasonal food in the place.  The pies looked good and included unusual flavors, such as grape and bumbleberry (a combination of berries).  More about pie later.

To get to the dining area, you have to walk through a very dated and tacky gift shop.  Think \"I love my dog\" doormats and other generic gimcrack.  No locally made crafts or postcards of the area.  Really sad.

The table has stacks of promotions on it, including an ad for the peanut butter spread that is made not just with sugar and corn syrup, but also with marshmallow cream.  Guess it takes three kinds of sugar to get it right.  

Our server was very nice and efficient, about the only good thing I can say for this place.  As others have noted, the menu is full of rules.  Not that I wanted to take home anything from the salad bar, share a meal, or order from the kids menu, but it seems inhospitable.  Your dinner choices are meat and starch, with the exception of the 1970's salad bar and the \"vegetable of the day\" which my father ordered (corn).  It was right out of a can.  In a restaurant surrounded by farms.

Because it was so cold in the restaurant, I ordered hot tea (they didn't mess that up) and a cup of the soup of the day - cream of brocolli.  It should have been called cream soup.  Or maybe bowl o' hot cream.  It was yellow and flavorless, with a few confetti specs of brocolli, so thick with cream that it was able to hold my spoon standing straight up in the middle of the cup.

I appreciate that they offered me a smaller portion of the meatloaf and mashed potatoes, even though I don't qualify for the senior citizen section of the menu.  I think the waitress violoated Mary Yoder's Menu Code by doing that.  

My dinner was served lukewarm and covered with generic brown gravy.  If they must serve mediocre food, could they at least manage to serve it hot?  To their credit, the potatoes were \"real\" rather than instant.  The meatloaf was OK, but again, not hot.  

I shoud not have ordered dessert, but I had been looking forward to the pie for two days.  Huge disappointment.  My first clue should have been that they offer at least 30 different pies.  No way to do that without cutting every possible corner.  Another bad sign was that they distinguish between \"peach pie\" and \"fresh peach pie.\"  

I ordered the raspberry cream pie because I've never heard of it and I love all things raspberry.  It was not a slice of pie at all, but vanilla pudding with raspberry pie filling (out of a can, I'm sure) dumped on top.  Fortunately, I had requested no whipped cream, but I was not able to finish it.  The waitress explained to me that she \"made\" the pie to order by putting the raspberry over the pudding.  Oddly, she didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with that, or with calling it pie.  

I felt so uncomfortably full that I had to ask my father to drive and I went to bed as soon as we got home (9:30).  

This whole place feels like a chain restaurant you would find at a freeway exit and patronize out of desperation.  There is nothing ethnic or regional about it.  The only authenticity is that it is a genuine example of what is wrong with America, especially the Midwest."}
{"text":"The pies alone, get 5 starts.  The restaurant gets minus stars.  

We ate off their buffet. Had extensive salad bar; interestingly, many items on salad bar not home made. Most amazingly, fake bacon bits!  Talking the bright red fake crunchy stuff, that barely resembles bacon. Dressings not home made either. I don't mind store bought dressing, but at least buy good stuff. 

Hot buffet: home made (and tasty) mashed potatoes, excellent stuffing.  That's where the positive ends. Everything else bland, under seasoned, and just not good.  Lots of gravies and sauces. Had 4 meats: roast pork, pulled beef, ribs, and fried chicken.  Pork and beef watery, bland, and kind of gross.  Properly cooked, but flavorless. Fried chicken weird: think pan fried, with skin mushy and falling off, so not really fried.  Bland and flavorless. Had to ask for bbq sauce to make all meats edible. Ribs really fatty and not slow roasted. Toothy meat, but dowsed in bbq sauce, so had some flavor. Weird thing is buffet had chicken noodle soup and beef noodle soup, but no bowls.  Was told to be used as a sauce. Again, both bland and under seasoned. 

Service: some Amish staff.  Servers slow and not very good. Not professional servers.  Don't be in a hurry, even if ordering buffet. 

Now onto the only reason to come here: the pies. Had the bumble berry and banana cream pie. WOW!  Superb. Bumble berry is mixture of blueberry, raspberry, and cherry. Fantastic. Banana cream pie best I ever had. One slice in the restaurant is $4. A whole pie in the attached store is $10.  A bargain!  

Bottom line: skip the restaurant and just get a whole pie to take with you."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing.  Roast beef was very dry and bland.  Chicken greasy.  And everything had way too much sugar.  Plus the menu/place was filled with too many rules, \"you can't share this\", \"you can't substitute that\", \"everyone at table must order from the same menu.\"  While we didn't intend to do any of that, all the visible rules on menu and signs definitely made the experience feel less warm and less hospitable.  Definitely not deserving of the hype we've heard, rather more reminiscent of a Golden Corral.  

Will not return - there is far better in the area (See Dutch Country Restaurant)."}
{"text":"Not much of a selection for a buffet it used to be much better, but the last few times I've eaten there it was not worth the money, I will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"What I wanted was a store where I could get \"stuff \" made by Amish crafts people. 

As someone, who lives thousands of miles from anything Amish...is that too much to expect. 

If that what you want when you're driving by don't bother stopping. 

This store isn't what I expected at all. We didn't eat at the restaurant or buy any of the baked goods...I'm sure it's good.

I was surprised how very little of the crafts were made locally. They had a bunch of stuff that wasn't unique to what I though was the strength of the Amish community, quilts, stuff made of wood, etc.
They sold just as much stuff from China as any other store. 
I was really disappointed and I think this store is missing a huge opportunity to feature culturally unique items, crafts, artwork, quits, knitting...the list goes on and on...
Instead this store is one of many nondescript stores with no soul... They might as well be a Walmart!"}
{"text":"The bakery and fresh bread gets 4 or 5 stars.  The tacky gift shop is sooo touristy and dated.  Then there is the restaurant.  I know Amish food is hearty, not light, modern, and health conscious.  Even accepting that, the menu is overpriced.  The selections are very basic.  The family meals are good for good groups, but pricey unless you really eat a good deal.  The salad bar is very dated, not very fresh looking vegetables.  Also, be careful when you stop.  If a bus tour arrives, be ready to wait.  And then there is the impromptu \"smoking lounge\" in the parking lot, just outside the door that you can't help but walk through.  Go for the bakery, not for much else."}
{"text":"Family and I visited recently. I had the fried shrimp with fries and salad. The shrimp was very good and the fries were average. The iceberg lettuce in the salad was a bit old and some pieces should have been thrown away. For dessert I had the pecan pie which was delicious. Unfortunately the chair next to me was full of crumbs and the restroom needed a good cleaning. The restrooms also do not have any hot water to rinse your hands which is a big no no."}
{"text":"The peanut butter spread is addictive; if you don't want all of the extra calories and sugar, don't even try it because you won't be able to stop eating it.  Have the BBQ pork sandwich on grilled bread. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a quick review:
We ordered 3 dinner plates. The ones I would order next time are: roast beef, fried chicken thigh, sweet potato fries with cinnamon dip.

Baby friendliness: 2/5 no place to breastfeed. Changing table in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Stopped recently when my daughter was in from California, disappointing at best, have come here for at least 35 yrs or so, always a go to when out-of-towners visited, no longer, the past 3 to 5 yrs the food quality has went down as prices went up. The buffet is kinda pricey and now soup is xtra, if it wasn't for the gift shop and the tourists I don't think they could make it anymore. The breakfast buffet has also fallen off. I was wondering why my wife and I haven't stopped in awhile, now I remember, as a local I'd suggest drive on by."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch while doing some business in the area.  My wife's chicken salad sandwich was good, and the service was fine.  However, the turkey dinner was less than mediocre: pressed turkey breast, lukewarm mashed potatoes, canned (tasteless) corn, and rolls straight from the grocery store bag.  As Woody Allen might quip, at least there was plenty of it."}
{"text":"We often eat here when visiting my Mother and her husband. The hot roast beef sandwich is my chosen favorite."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service is hit or miss depending on when you go.  The bread rolls are always fresh and the servings are ;plentiful.  They have that awesome peanut butter spread and apple butter for your rolls btw.  They are a good traditional Amish resaurant right in the heart of Middlefield and close to many shops to tour.  I recommend the broasted chicken and get the white meat; the dark meat has a wet batter, while the white meat has a better coating.  They also have a decent buffet."}
{"text":"The service continues to be hit or miss. Today it was great.

The buffet food is decent, although the buffet is overpriced. There is chicken, roast beef, meat loaf, and an assortment of vegetables and a salad bar.

The rest of the menu features comfort food."}
{"text":"Always good to go to middlefield and burton. This place is clean and always good food. Last trip i got roast beef an mashed pot. Very good. Salad bar good  the bakery is good but end of day most gone   try this place i have not found a bad day yet where food was not good and a lot  then go to cheese factory!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mary yoder.   We love the pies , salad bar.   Their meatloaf and turkey dinners are our favorites.  We love the drive to get here also, passing a sheep farm."}
{"text":"Mary Yoder's is an OK place to dine.  It's likely more suited to groups or families - eating solo or with a friend puts the \"family style\" on the expensive side of the menu options.

The food is simple but good. If  you want a generous open-face sammich with real mashed potatoes this is the place for you.  if you're looking for haute cuisine you're going to be disappointed. It's pricey, but you won't leave hungry. Be it by design or fate - the 3 or 4 times we've gone here this place has had some patrons of gargantuan proportion, one assumes drawn in by the promise of endless chow to slake their near bottomless appetites.

If you're into ramming your face with huge quantities of mediocre food cooked and served in huge tubs than the breakfast buffet is for you - you can line up at the food-trough behind the barely adequate sneeze-guard with the other massive patrons of the buffet and go to town.  It's not for me. If it's not obvious I actually find it quite un-appetizing.

The staff are friendly enough but don't be surprised if you find that you're a little lonely; and you can see \"real live Amish in the wild\". Once that novelty wears off you realize they're just like any other teenager doing a job they're not crazy about.

Overall we don't come here often despite the fact that we're only a few miles away - after you get an entree with a salad and a soda it is, IMO, too pricey for what you get.  This biggest thing that Yoder's has going for it is the fact that the restaurants worth patronizing in this general area can be counted on one hand - even if you've had a horrible thrasher accident. 

There is bakery and other things to-go. Again, people seem to go ga-ga over Amish bakery, but I find it rather bland and dry - my mom made better pie crust.  Anyone can drop a can of pie filling in a Pillsbury pie crust and you'll be having nearly the same experience without the oppression of women or the horse crap caked in your wheel wells. The last piece of pie I got (blueberry) was merely a slice of jelly with a smattering of berries. Epic fail.

Come for the experience - but don't set expectations too high and you'll leave happy enough."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on my way from Middlefield to Eastlake.  It is not fancy - no haute cuisine here.  But if you want a friendly face to serve you and good old fashioned home cooking, this is the place.  A good mix of locals and tourists (but I'm not sure there are many other choices in the area :-D).

Warned of the large portions, I ordered the 1/2 portion of chicken & noodles with potatoes.  I still couldn't manage half of it!  The noodles had good flavor and the mashed potatoes had a good balance between heft and fluff.  My drink stayed full and I left a happy gal.  Maybe I'm jaded with east coast prices, but my sub $10 lunch seemed a good value."}
{"text":"Cushioned in the heart of Middlefield, Mary Yoder's is a delight. There is a restaurant, bakery, and gift shop. On the weekends, you can find bus tours, buggies, and family vans all parked out front in the large parking lot. I have never eaten in the restaurant, however they are known for their homemade classics and oven-baked chicken. There is a senior menu and the option for \"family-style\" meals as well. 

 Hands down my favourite place for pies! I strongly reccommend in the summertime, the peach or strawberry pies! Talk about farm-to-table with fresh picked fruit made in a glaze poured in a homemade crust ! Ask for the fresh whipped cream too! 

On this trip, we purchased several cookies to take home with us. We chose the Maple-Frosted and Spell Binders. Spell Binders are a mix of coconut and oatmeal cookie with a maple glaze. Maple-Frosted is a cake cookie with maple frosting on top. Yummy! 
Also, there is a carry-out window if you call ahead for your bakery goodies!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!!!!!! Seriously  some of the best \"home cooked\" food I have had while traveling for work.
Went there for dinner and had the baked cod. Soooooooo yummy!!!!!! I liked it so much that I decided to wake up extra early the next day and drive 30 min out of my way to have breakfast there. Their pancakes are HUGE!!!!!!! Their menu has 3 pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 strips of bacon. I ate 1.5 total pancakes because they were so big. Top that off with real maple syrup!!!!! And I mean REAL 100% PURE maple syrup!!!! I would easily drive out of my way again to eat here!! All the horse and buggies (Amish) everywhere are awesome to see too!!!!
Go there!!!! You won't be disappointed!! I promise!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first Amish restaurant I went to when I visited Middlefield. I was greeted with smiles and great service. I ordered the baked/fried chicken that was so good and the mashed potatoes. And of course some of their apple pie that is one of he best slices I've ever had. Highly recommend it if you're visiting."}
{"text":"I have been a LONG time fan of this Amish restaurant .About a year ago they substituted a processed turkey for off the bone oven baked turkey. Yes you read it right. An Amish kitchen where one would expect farm raised, antibiotic free, pesticide free, preservative free home cooked food now boasts their serving processed gelatinous turkey in their authentic Amish restaurant. PITIFUL!!!!! I strongly suggest avoiding this place as who knows where they get the rest of what they serve. Try Hartville or Millersburg for authentic wholesome Amish food."}
{"text":"Sooooo much food!  Be prepared for huge plates heaped with wonderful, flavorful, rich food when you visit here.  The menu is large, with a wealth of home-cooking-style options.  The noodles and mashed potatoes dish (\"An Amish Favorite,\" according to the menu) needed pepper but was otherwise excellent; it is served with either beef or chicken -- beef meant a flavorful beef broth and shredded beef between the mounds of potatoes and layer of thick noodles.

Mary Yoder's is a large, bright restaurant with a gift shop at the front.  Beautiful quilts line the walls.  The staff is patient and efficient."}
{"text":"Ok..I was totally embarrassed when my mum came to visit from Ireland, as I drove her all the way here to experience the Amish food and lifestyle. I thought, Amish is synonymous with home cooked, thoughtfully prepared food. Think again...the garbage they serve up there is made up of instant soup/gravy and stale bread. I had the dish of the day...which I rarely do, but I thought I'd try it. It was chicken and biscuits....I had two bites and almost gagged. Then we tried dessert, which I thought they could manage..seeing that they have a bakery on site. I ordered a double chocolate german cake...surprise surprise the cake had a filling of instant pudding. The coffee was just as terrible. Please avoid this place...it is a tourist trap. I was surprised to see a lot of, what looked to be, bona-fide Amish diners in there though....rather sad."}
{"text":"We came hoping for the typical Amish meal, we left, incredibly disappointed. The fried chicken was soggy, the skin rubbery and well, disgusting. The ribs, fatty, tough and not worth feeding to dogs. The pork was equally bad and the cream peas and corn were not palatable. I will say the salad was fresh and the mashed potatoes were awesome. Add to the mix, horrible service and you have a dining experience you hope to soon forget! The ONLY thing Amish about this place is the name. Mary Yoder would be ashamed."}
{"text":"Finally I had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant yesterday because I am about 40 - 45 minutes from here, but I have to say it was worth the drive. The restaurant had a very casual feel to it which I liked and the an Amish woman woman was our waitress so I loved the authentic feel to it. I ordered the meatloaf, mash potatoes, and macaroni & cheese. I loved the mash potatoes and gravy and the meatloaf, but I wasn't a huge fan of the macaroni & cheese. I also got to taste a bit of their ham and also thought it was excellent. I also must add that their dinner rolls are amazing. You receive very large portions for what you pay for and I have plenty of left overs for lunch.  Beware though the food has a heavy feel to it and I would not suggest having plans to  do anything that is very active afterward. You will want to lay down and sleep."}
{"text":"Thus was a first and last visit for my girlfriend and I here. The server pushed the buffet which we did not want. We started with a bowl of chili that we shared. It was cery good. Then we ordered meatloaf, mashed potatoes and corn and breaded pork chops with mashed potatoes and corn. There is no way the potatoes are homemade. They were runny. Our food was served Luke warm at best. We had the date nut pudding for dessert which was an extremely dry piece of cake or bread with whipped topping slopped on top

We will not come back here."}
{"text":"We used to love this restaurant, but we made a visit here today and it seems to have really gone down hill. The food on the buffet was not really good and it was definitely not fresh. We were very disappointed! The buffet had small tongs being used in the food and they continued to fall in and I watched customers dive right into the food to grab them! I was so grossed out! We told the manager, but he didn't even really apologize or anything. He told us they are suppose to have big tongs in there and that he would tell them. Ugh! Yuck!! Not sure why others didn't mind that! Anyways, we were very disappointed and we would never go back for the price, cleanliness, food, or service. I guess we will drive out to Berlin next time. Sad. :-/"}
{"text":"Old MARY must have croaked!  

My folks used to bring my sister and me here 30 years ago. A decade later my husband and I would bring our own children. Now that we're empty nesters, we occasionally make the 30 mile drive to pay Mrs. Yoder a visit when we feel like a drive over the river and through the woods to one of our favorite Amish restaurants.  In the last couple of years, we have been witness to a dramatic decline in quality with an equally dramatic surge in prices. It's obvious that they've lost a good deal of their loyal patronage as well. 

The  oven baked chicken has lost its crunch. Don't order it after 12 noon or you'll get a bird that spent a little too long bagging rays under the heat lamp. The broth of the vegetable soup tasted like wild game. The \"homemade\" pie fillings and salad bar, which used to be made from the freshest ingredients in a hundred mile radius, now come out of a can. Slap some pudding out of 50-gallon drum onto a cardboard crust and Woolah!  You have coconut cream pie!  At least that's what they call it. 

We are so sad!  Where did the attention to detail go?  

Yep, old MARY must have croaked..or this establishment has been overtaken by a greedy corporate entity. Not even worth driving up again for a free birthday meal. They'd have to pay us to come back."}
{"text":"It's not spectacular but it's ok. It fits so perfectly in Middlefield, especially when you're just touring the small town and want to experience everything Amish.
Their breakfast buffet has a good variety but the food isn't that great and a lot of it is too greasy for my taste.
They have a real nice gift shop as part of the restaurant, and they also sell whole size pies that look real good. 
Overall a nice experience in midst of a real beautiful pastoral country side scenery."}
{"text":"We tried the breakfast buffet and was disappointed with the food taste and quality. I think we would have had a better experience if we had ordered off of the menu?  Servers were working hard and did a good job."}
{"text":"The Amish food was all American style mashed potatoes fried chicken meatloaf Buffet. Everything needed salt but for a taste of Amish food it was good. We loved the beautiful country side drive out from Kirtland Ohio."}
{"text":"The food was ok i had the cheese omlet and I've made better ones at home not saying it was bad or anything. The raisin toast was what did it for me you can tell it was fresh baked and I really liked it full of flavor. The interior reps the Amish look all the walls are covered by quilts and blankets and all for sale which I think is pretty cool. I asked the waitress of they where amish made and she didn't know. With a price tag of 800 dollars for a large blanket that you can't really tell if it's store bought or not I'm gonna take a pass. But other than that the hype isn't what I thought it be. I didn't glance in the store much that may be something to check out while passing through."}
{"text":"My mom and I love this place.  The food is great though I'm sure my sodium count went thru the roof!   On my 1st visit I had the chicken which was just ok.  Today I tried the turkey and it was really good.  The mashed potatoes are amazing and the dressing is fabulous.  The Mac and cheese is not something you'd expect from and Amish restaurant, but it's a terrific side.  My mom is hooked on the mashed potatoes topped with noodles as well as the chicken noodle soup.  The sweet peanut butter spread for the soft warm yummy rolls is out of this world.  We were too full to have dessert, but it's coming home with us and we hope that it makes it home.  The waitresses really are Amish and have always been very pleasant and quite good.  Sign up for the birthday club, you get a free entree up to $12.00, which is quite reasonable bec. I think the most expensive meal is only $13.50.  Well worth the money for such good food."}
