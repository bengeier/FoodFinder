{"text":"Pizza is legit here, definitely coming back. This is a good pizza spot, service is great and quick as well. At this point this is just a filler sentence. Yelp is forcing me to write a review, I just wanted to help boost the stars for this establishment..."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla in Toronto!  Highly recommended the chicken and bacon quesadilla with extra cheese, mushrooms, red onions and roasted red peppers with the most delicious garlic dill sauce ever!  YUM!  The chicken shawarma is also pretty great."}
{"text":"I've only ever had their chicken pitas, but they are delicious!  ...if a bit on the small side.  But still good.  I work in the area and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Scary stuff.  I had the \"beef\" burrito.  It was a mess of mystery meat, Asian rice, frozen peas, carrots, mushrooms, beans, and sour cream.  I know Toronto is far from the Mexican border but they could at least google the word burrito.  Never again..."}
{"text":"A large slice of pizza and pop for $3:79, not too bad for a quick bite to eat.

I only sampled the pizza and it was DELICIOUS!  Not dry at all, like the previous review.  The perfect amount of grease and cheese (I said delicious, not healthy) with tasty dough.  Very friendly person working behind the counter as well."}
{"text":"i went there several time the food was awsome ...and look like good and friendly people working there ...."}
{"text":"I've always been a bit skeptical about this place. For one this used to be an awesome Brazilian restaurant so I was a bit spiteful when it closed. Then throw in that all the 5 star reviews are from people with less than 10 reviews... Like I said, skeptical. 
But since moving closer to it, I have stopped in for takeout a couple times and indulged in a few of its offerings, and must say its a damn legit provider of pizza and panzerottis. 

The pizza has a nice crust and a wide variety of toppings to choose from. It's not groundbreaking pizza by any means but tasty and they've got a good deal for 2 medium 3 topping pizzas for less than $22 after tax which comes with their house made garlic dipping sauce. 

The panzerotti was pretty incredible. You pick 3 toppings for less than $6.50 after tax, and it was one of the best panzerottis I've had in the city. I'll admit that Toronto has a lot of terrible panzerottis to compare to, but this thing was just a good flavour with proper doughiness. While marinara is the traditional sauce of choice for such an item, I'll admit that the garlic sauce was a great replacement.

I'm now convinced of this places legitimacy, and Yummy Pizza gets 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"To address Kumru A.'s claim that I am trying to confuse people with my reviews:

I write detailed accounts of my experiences, and will stand by every word.  I am certainly not trying to confuse anybody.  Note that the majority of my reviews are 4s and 5s, so it's not like I'm a harsh critic out to slag people unfairly.

My visit to Yummy Pizza was a bad one, as was that of my brother.  It is possible whomever was preparing the food on those occasions was having an off day but, nevertheless, I can only rate for what I had.  The same goes for Chito's."}
{"text":"The corner of Landsdowne and Dundas used to boast a really colourful, vibrant, and imaginative Brazilian cafe whose owners were friendly, outgoing, and made sure to add a wide variety of unusual dishes to their hotplate menu.  Its passing is a tragic loss, especially when it's a place like Yummy Pizza (Chito's Place) that's replaced it.

Once bright and cheerful, the sort of place where the local kids actually dressed well in and brought their young dates to, this corner eatery has seriously degenerated.  Chito hasn't even bothered to replace the previous cafe's decor or exterior gaucho signage, although a lot of it is tattered and askew on the walls now. Flies, dirty mats, a disorganized appearance, specials announced by scrawls on the exterior glass.  Were I the owner of the previous bistro, I'd be heartbroken just to pass the place on the street. 

The pizza itself is typical Toronto fare: dry, crunchy, bland, virtually no tomato sauce, and as stiff and rigid as a rooftop shingle.  Small plastic cups of dipping sauces (because, you know, the pizza is a cracker, really) are available for an extra charge.  And, heaven forbid that they don't try to take a nip at every other typical fastfood option apart from burgers, they offer burritos and schwarmas as well. Big whoopee.

Yeah, it's pizza.  You just want pizza?  Fine, go ahead.  But yummy?  No, not really. Memorable?  No, not really.  Worth taking time out of the day to get to on your really tight lunch break?  Ok, sure, if you're starving."}
{"text":"Still ordering from here. The pizza quality has NEVER wavered, unlike most shops where as the years go by the quality goes up and down. I have never once been disappointed with an order from Yummy. The price has rarely changed, and is always reasonable. They deliver fast, the pizza stays good for days in the fridge, and the delivery guy is super nice!

Please check them out if you live in the area. You can order from them on Just Eat, which is how I almost always order. They're on UberEats now as well which is cool."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here via Uber Eats, the pizza came on time, it was pretty good.  The wings tasted ok but they were amazingly small.  We ordered 40 wings for the office, 20 of them fit in a box meant for a small order of fries.  they were more like chicken nuggets where half the nugget was bone.  Wing goes in mouth, out comes bone almost instantly.  Tried eating two at the same time, works just as smoothly.  Tried for three but then I was amongst co workers so had to put my curiosity aside."}
{"text":"I am just going to be honest. I came here because Dominoes is temporarily closed for renovations. From the outside, the place looks very cheesy (no pun intended). The name ``Yummy Pizza`` is just so..boring. 

Anyways, I was going to get a chicken Shawarma but it looked unappetizing. There was just a small little sliver of it with a very sad looking tomato. So, I decided to get 2 slices, 1 veggie and 1 pepperoni. While waiting for it, the guy serving me kept staring at me. I finally got my pizza and decided to take it to go. Just before I left he said to me ``This place is better than Dominoes`` in a very serious voice. 

I finally got to eating the pizza and it was probably the worst I have ever had. It was so greecy and the pepperoni tasted funky. The vegetables were droopy and aged, it was all just a big mess. 

Moreover, I don`t recommend you coming here. Its awful and the staff do not have any respect their customers."}
{"text":"Come here all the time just for the chicken plate and their chicken wings. If you haven't yet tried the chicken plate for $10, you will regret it. The best thing i've ever tried. Been to other middle eastern places for their shawarmas, and honestly, nothing can compare to their chicken plate...Service is always friendly! :)"}
