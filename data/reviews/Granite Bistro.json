{"text":"I am really impressed with the food and staff. I have worked in the neighborhood for years and wondered why offering fresh good food in an office building seemed to be impossible. Well the impossible came real. Everything is fresh, tasty and the team is running a business they can be proud of. Also caters for meetings and we even ordered a Christmas turkey from them."}
{"text":"Granite Bistro is a hidden gem! Hands-down, it is the best cafeteria-style restaurant I've encountered. Having worked in the area for many years, I was thrilled when this place opened in 2013. The staff is passionate about quality, variety and service. The menu is not only fresh and healthy, but it is also inspired and creative. As a vegetarian, I greatly appreciate that the chefs make a fresh hot veggie lunch entr√©e every single day. In addition to some longstanding favourites that pop up on the menu regularly (hello sweet potato burritos!), there are always new delicious dishes to try. If you ate at Granite every day (which I am tempted to do!), you will never have the same meal twice in a week. The staff are pleasant and professional, the space is always bright and spotless, and the food is reasonably priced. If I could change anything, it would be the location: the restaurant is in the basement of a busy office park medical building and is hard to find from the street. (Oh, and I would add a veggie burger to the regular menu.) Otherwise... for quality, value and customer service, my thumbs are way up!"}
{"text":"Excellent little breakfast-lunch place hidden away in the basement of a rather depressing but apparently high-traffic medical building. I hate visiting the building because I hate seeing the doctor, but this little place has made it so much better. Delicious lunch specials usually with meat or fish and a vegetable side, all-day egg-and-bacon sandwiches, pizza, drinks, coffee, pastries, and much more. The staff is unexpectedly gracious and friendly every single time. They should open a place downtown! Love it."}
