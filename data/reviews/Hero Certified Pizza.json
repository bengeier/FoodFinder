{"text":"5 stars for the sauce!! Pizzas are individual size pizzas but sensibly priced. Great ingredients, I had there one with anchovies and capers, amazingly satisfying given I skipped lunch and just wanted a slice before I left the stock yards. Definitely will be back. Odd for a pizza place with the flavours they have, they don't have Brio."}
{"text":"First of its kind in all of Toronto, and definitely pleased with my first visit. Their pizzas are all personal, and their toppings are very simple with affordable prices. The wait times were quick and well, maybe that's because it was fairly new and wasn't occupied as much as I thought it would be.

They serve their pizza's on a wooden board with your own pizza cutter which I thought was a nice touch. Maybe they could implement them being cut beforehand so they wouldn't have to issue out so many just for safety reasons in case kids are around, but anyway - this place makes ordering personal pizzas uncomplicated, however KIND OF complicated because there's a variety to choose from that I guess you could then become unsure of which ones exactly you want to go for.

So for my first visit, I ordered the potato with meat, the broccoli with some meat and then the fried egg with spicy salami? They were all decent, except the salami with fried egg atop was probably my fave. That one also had sliced potatoes on it and it was delicious. After halving 3 personal pizzas I was pretty full. 

They also have a glass jar of free ferrero rochers so (with my fat ass) of course I helped myself to that lol. I would recommend this place if you were looking into getting a personal pizza since they're not traditional pizza slices and they have a decent combination of flavors to satisfy most peoples' taste buds. I would only suggest for them to make a more visible/noticeable sign outside since I was circling around The Stockyards for a while before realizing it was right next to Booster Juice."}
{"text":"We were excited to try hero certified pizza but very disappointed from the dine in experience. The place is small, Not kid friendly. This place is not for family.
Only personal pizzas there is not much options. Definitely waste of money."}
{"text":"I have to say I was hugely satisfied with this place. 

I work nearby and am always looking for new lunch places and this place will become a regular haunt. I especially love the \"breakfast\" pizza with thin potato slices, pancetta and runny egg. 

The good: the pizza is really good, and the portions are pretty cheap. 

The bad: small portions.

What the portions lack in size they make up for in quality. Try this place out, it's just $3.50 for a snack."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time yesterday evening and we were blown away! Pizzas are excellent, much better than many of the gourmet pizza restaurants we've tried in the city. The display pizzas may not look all that appealing (precooked options are on display to show the ingredients for the various pizzas) but once cooked the actual pizzas look fantastic and are absolutely delicious. This place far exceeded my expectations, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I spent the day near Stock Yard Village and thought I'd head there for lunch as I knew they had a few restaurants.  I saw Hero Certified Pizza ... apparently they have been open since March and this is the first one.  I've been to Hero Burgers and was curious to see how they'd do pizza.

They have personal pizzas (about 5.5 inches each) and there are 15 to choose from (quite a variety!).

I ordered a Diavola pizza and a Cacciatore pizza.  I love love love pizza and, to be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  To my surprise, they were really good.  The crust was light and tasty.  The sauce and cheese were good.  There was a nice heat spice-wise with the Diavola.  I'd get them again.

I'll be back!"}
