{"text":"Don't eat the sushi. Just witnessed the worker cutting the salmon coughing and having stuff come out of his mouth while cutting the fish. He left the counter to wipe his mouth but did NOT wash his hands before cutting the fish again. (Fish is cut without gloves). Brought to the attention of the manager who was frankly not interested. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"A Chinese supermarket with cheap food options? Why not?  A relatively new supermarket in Pickering, one that tries to rival blue sky supermarket little bit down the road. This is a Chinese supermarket which also has take-out options at your disposal. I decided to go here with my girlfriend to get some groceries for home. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that they also have options for you to buy take out. They have a hot bar, a bakery with fresh bread, and a sushi area to take out some fresh sushi.  The grocery area is like a typical Chinese supermarket - where you can get fresh fruits and veggies for a cheap price compared to the other supermarket chains. The selection is quite good and anything you are looking to find they should have as well.  After getting groceries we decided to get some takeout as well as we were quite hungry after shopping. They have a pretty good selection for food but when we tried it it is nothing spectacular. For the price of the meal though you cannot go wrong. A meal for two including a drink we probably paid about 10 bucks. They have a lot of options such as dim sum, rice combo's, and several meat options.  If you don't mind eating food that is a little bit older, probably a few hours old, they also pack up some leftovers that you can purchase for a discounted price.   If you visit them probably around an hour before closing they pack up any food that was not purchased during the day, such as bread, and will sell it for about a dollar or 2. Which is an absolutely steal. Mind you, don't expect gourmet bread or anything like that.  Overall this grocery is very well-run, with a lot of options for you to not only get groceries but have take-out options as well. This is probably my new go to supermarket in Pickering."}
{"text":"I'm glad they finally opened a convenient Asian supermarket in the area. It's new, clean and has a lot of variety.  There's a hot food table, fresh sushi table, bakery, halal meat, deli, etc. I got the avocado smoothie which was yummy!  I'll have to go back and try the other items."}
{"text":"Having shopped at Pacific Fresh Food Market twice, I can say that so far it fills a niche for Chinese and Seafood grocery shopping in Pickering. They have ingredients like lotus root, fresh water chestnut and pea shoots that are difficult to find east of Scarborough. Good seafood section. Wow, they even have the elusive (in Durham) Vietnam Buns! I love those crusty yet airy buns and I had to drive to Scarborough to get them. There really is no bun like a Vietnam Bun, so please go to Pacific, grab the bread tongs, reach down into that big plastic bin and grab yourself some Vietnam Buns. Please, buy some so that Pacific will keep stocking them! Blue Sky had them for a while, then stopped carrying them. Their hot food counter looks interesting, and I will add to my post once I have tried it. Unlike the former Pickering T-Phat, this is a very clean and well organized store. So far so good, and I will update my review as I experience more of this promising grocery store."}
{"text":"Only their take out / eat in food area.   A really good deal on some very tasty food.  Much better value than the food court in malls or Chinese take out / delivery food.  If they ever branch out to other cuisines watch out!   The neighbouring restaurants would be in trouble. U"}
{"text":"Update: Pacific has a good selection of ethnic foods, produce, spices, meat and seafood (including shucked Fanny Bay oysters!). BBQ has definitely improved, worth a try. Other prepared foods are handy for a quick Grab and Go meal. Conveniently open on holidays. All in all a very welcome addition to Pickering."}
{"text":"I've been to Pacific Fresh Food Market many times since they opened. It's very conveniently located close to home and has some very good deals on hot food, especially after 7:30pm.   Their food has been consistently very tasty but their customer service, especially from the younger staff, needs some work. I've been ignored several times while staff putter around behind the counter or finish conversations with their colleagues. I feel like I'm bothering them. Unfortunately, this behaviour is not limited to the hot food counter.  On my most recent visit, I ordered BBQ duck and roast pork with rice, the same dish I've ordered and enjoyed several times. It's good, very good. On this visit, however, the fellow, same guy who served me on previous visits, refused to serve the duck. There were several whole ducks hanging in the window but he said several times, \"no cut\" in broken English. I know he understands and speaks English because he's served me before. I didn't get it. I didn't get the duck or pork either.  I've witnessed arguments between staff and customers. One point deducted (for now).  I ended up getting a couple of jerk chicken leg quarters for $2.99. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have since purchased some grade AA beef short ribs for Korean galbi feast and the ribs were awesome!  Their excellent daily deals on prepared hot food are hard to top anywhere in the vicinity.  VIVA PFFM!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but unfortunately I found it to be pretty overpriced for the produce they provide.   The selection of fresh produce was just okkk and the staff weren't the most helpful."}
{"text":"Great prices at this grocery store! Fruits and vegetables are quite fresh and prices are very good. Food at kitchen is tastier than i expected. Lots of variety and always something good on sale!"}
