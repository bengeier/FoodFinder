{"text":"I'm from Cincinnati but working in Cleveland and was searching for a \"sushi\" buffet.  Regrettably this was the 5th entry and shame on me for not looking closely enough at the description.  Needless to say, upon arriving I was terribly disappointed to find no sushi.  Just an average chinese buffet.  The hot and sour soup was good.  The eggrolls, not so much.  The selection of entrees was good and everything was reasonably well presented but nothing really stirred my imagination.  So, I had stir fry prepared on the mongolian grille, which - despite having only 5 sauces and a very limited selection of veggies - wasn't too bad.  All-in-all, if chinese is how your pleasure tends, then you probably won't be disappointed.  However, if it's sushi you seek: look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A few days ago I purchased two vegetable egg rolls to go at a dollar each. They were very tiny compared to other places I would go to. I didn't think they were worth a dollar."}
{"text":"Went back.  Still very good. The staff is above standard.. very nice and attentive. For the price of a fast food combo (or less) you get great food and good desserts. They have several scoop ice creams and ice cream machine. They have sushi but I dont eat it.  My family says its ok and I wouldnt expect expensive ingredients at a low cost buffet.  Its good food low price nice people and I cannot belive some of the more negative reviews."}
{"text":"The Double Dragon always has an amazing variety of dishes. The staff do a fine job of keeping them filled. The crab legs alone are worth the price. I recommend you check it out for a delicious Chinese experience!"}
{"text":"What a horrible place ! Food is sub standard and when brought to managements attention they just don't care . Also $80 for four people please . Did they fly the food over from china."}
{"text":"Bad quality food.  Not so clean. Not worth the money in my opinion. Little variety. So high in carbs and fat. Better off eat at special restaurant like Italian or lebanese.  Your value for the money and your health is much more. Also poor utensils and plates."}
{"text":"OK, After reading some of the negative reviews (especially the guy who listed every item on the buffet and how bad it was) I felt I just HAD to write a review. I've been going here for a long time now. It is one of my favorite restaurants. I've gone with a friend, with family and by myself. It is clean, the staff is friendly, you can have what you want from the buffet, or if you choose have a custom stir fry made by one of their cooks. I've never found anything cold that should have been hot, and if the tray is empty just ask a waitress to have it filled. They are very friendly and aim to please. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Also, the atmosphere is very restful. I've been in Chinese restaurants that are playing anything but what I think of as Asian music. When I go for lunch by myself I take a book. It's a nice place to sit and relax for a while. I don't think you will be disappointed by the experience."}
{"text":"This place is very hit and miss. When it's good, it's very good. When it's bad, it's just okay. The food is fresh and hot for the most part. The buffet line is clean. Lunch and early evening seems like the best time to go. They have buffet take out and charge by weight which is convenient."}
{"text":"They had a large variety of food, and the restaurant was clean, but the food quality was very poor. I'm quite certain all of the chicken dishes used canned meat, which was very off putting."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet i have ever been to in my entire life we went for the craglegs which smell like a dirty fish tank and we had to ask for hot butter the server looked at me like i was crazy when i asked for it ....the rest of the buffet was cold old and horrible i wont go back to this place if it was free i told the owner it was the worst display of food i ever seen i would have been better off takin my 65 dollars and throwing it out the window on the freeway dont waste your time go to the one on snow road thats a real buffet. Kumo buffet the sushi is fresh they cost a little more but trust me its worth it ......but the double dragon is for people that dont care and will eat anything"}
{"text":"Visited on Father's Day.  It was 94 degrees outside and about 90 INSIDE the restaurant!  Maybe they did that so people would only eat one plate and hurry and leave.  Not that anyone would stuff themselves.  Food was lacking in seasoning.  Desserts were lacking in variety.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to! Everything was cold - except for the sushi which was supposed to be cold. I feel sick from the tiny amount of food I was able to choke down. Don't waste your money. Drive to Hong Kong King Buffet instead."}
{"text":"Really good food. All fresh and the fruit bar was amazing. Highly recommend is the crab ragoons. Only down fall is please take your crab legs out of the water and don't let them sit in the water. Great service also."}
{"text":"Went in around 7pm on a Sunday, and it was fairly busy. Well I was looking forward to some craplegs but they haven't put any out.. so round one I grabbed some sweet and sour chicken (which was sitting for a while) and only thing else that was edible at the time was the rice and they just put out some chicken on a stick so that was fresh at least but every other item was never changed out it's now 8:45 as I write this and nothing has been changed out or refreshed since about 7:45.. and there is still a decent amount of people in here still.. and also no new crab legs were ever brought out even when I asked for some.. because if I'm paying the premium price for crab legs then I should be able to do so.. or at least give me a discount for not having that item (for for the most part any item) but nope no discount at all.. will never come here again..I also wanted to add.. they were cleaning the kitchen with a pressure washer!?   That's a first for me.."}
{"text":"This place is great! 
Firstly, it's actually pretty nice inside. Buffets normally have their fair share of ripped chairs and booths and banged up tables. This place has none of that. In addition the dining area is open and big, not claustrophobic feeling like most places.
There's three big sections of food, as well as a Mongolian bbq and sushi.
We will be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"This place is alright in my book. Sure it has it's flaws but seriously for the price...you cant really miss. Seven bucks will get your fat ass eating all you can for lunch (not sure on pricing for dinner, but I advise you don't go for dinner) They have a wide selection of food, and the place is never too crowded. The servers aren't half bad, and are very attentive for the most part. With the exception of one terrible service I went to, I can't bad mouth them much. It was one time when I went to dinner service, and the entire time I was there these cheap bastards didn't put out any crab legs, despite the fact that it was on the menu. BOOOOOOOOOOOO! See? Told you not to go to dinner service. Stick with lunch! The customers in the restaurant are by far the worst part. I'll name off a few. First off, you got the indecisive douche. These are the people that stand in front of something you want to grab, but they have trouble making a decision on what they want. So what do they do? Just stand there looking at the food, and thinking that something is going to change just by staring at it. Then you got the roadblocks. These are the fat ass people who come to a buffet because it would be much cheaper to spend seven dollars here to feast, than it would be at home. These people move extremely slow, breathe heavy, and take huge portion. Also you have to go completely around them in order to advance and get on with your life. Then there is loud cellphone idiot. The name is self explanatory so if you need a description of this type of person, you may just be that very type of person: An idiot. Then you just have stupid people in general. I once seen a guy yelling at a staff member about \"Where's the salad dressing!\" The dude was literally standing in front of it. I also seen a dude take condiments that were supposed to stay at the buffet section (so everyone can use it) and bring it to his table. So yeah.....a lot of people who come here are terrible. Best to try to be seated in isolation, and enjoy the meal. I see some reviews here of people really dissing this place, and perhaps some are in the right, but seriously it's 7 dollars for a buffet. What the fuck did you people expect? The food is pretty decent, the staff is bearable, and they even have desserts. What more do you people want for that price? Ease the fuck up."}
{"text":"Chinese buffets are the holy grail to me, and so upon moving to the area I quickly searched one out near my place and found Double Dragon. It is located in a small strip-mall but it a huge restaurant. 

There was a good mix of everything there. More stuff happened to fall on the sweet side, but that's the stuff I like anyways - sesame chicken, sweet and sour, etc. I wish there was more spicy options as well, but overall the food is good. There is a pretty large selection so there is something for everyone. The only complaint I have is that their dumplings are terrible. They have way too much dough on them. But otherwise, I thought it was a solid buffet.

Prices are reasonable for both dinner and lunch, although like all Chinese buffets, they serve a lot of sea food at dinner so the price is a bit higher than I find at some other buffets, especially since I don't like sea food.

I would recommend this place to someone in the area with a Chinese craving."}
{"text":"I have been to a handful of Chinese buffets on the West Side over time--Great Wall China Buffet (at Great Northern), Hong Kong King Buffet (at Ridge Park Square), and Oriental Palace Buffet (on Warren Rd.)--and Double Dragon is probably the best of the bunch so far.  The restaurant is the largest of the group and probably the cleanest--both in the dining tables and the upkeep of the buffet area.  Almost all of the usual Chinese buffet staples were available, and the food quality is about average among the group.  I wasn't crazy about how the dumplings for the Wanton Soup were placed separately from the soup, as that inevitably leads to tougher dumplings.  I've also had better BBQ Pork elsewhere, and the sushi selection was pretty abysmal.  One food item that stood out (in a positive way) was the Egg Custard--somewhat like a Filipino sponge-cake torta."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim and well, was not impressed. The place is enormous and very clean. The staff is typical for these kinds of places.

The food selection was quite large, but in general tasteless. Not sure how that is possible. Every piece of sushi tasted the same, and I know my sushi. Even the desserts were just meh. Nothing impressive anywhere."}
{"text":"I don't normally like buffets. This was awesome.  Fresh. Tons of choices and cheap"}
{"text":"This place has a good variety of dishes. Come for dinner and they'll add crab legs to the buffet."}
{"text":"Many veg options however the rice noodles are cooked with chicken broth. I took a bite and tasted chicken, spit it out. Clean place good food."}
{"text":"Tried this place out Wednesday night around 7 after hearing great things...all I can say is NO. Pick anywhere else. Anywhere would be better

Side note I found a big piece of those pan scrubbies in my Lomein noodles and that wasn't even the worst part..."}
{"text":"Double dragon buffet is my favorite Chinese restaurant/buffet I've ever been too! My family loves it too! 

Once you walk inside you see Chinese decor around the restaurant, and you are promptly seated by a hostess. They have traditional Chinese music playing in the background which adds to the ambience. Once your drink orders are taken, you're free to go get your food. They have tons if options, and even have crab legs if you go at dinner! The only bad part is they always run out instantly as people take ridiculous amounts back with them. They also have a chef in the back left corner who will cook your choice of meat and veggies fresh, and it's no additional cost (although tipping is customary). I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill over the years.  Food was Luke warm, bland, and lacking selection.  I haven't been here for 3 years, and I was surprised how yucky it was."}
{"text":"Went out with family and feel it was a complete waste of $60. I couldnt eat, had to go next door and get myself mexican. Buffet was empty and what was there was old and cold. Remember going as a family a few years back and loved it. Not this time. We wont be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years. Fair prices the food is hot and always get restocked quickly but I have noticed the crab legs Are not as good as it used to be it's soggy and bland and when provided there is never enough to go around. But it's a great place to go when you crave Chinese food for a cheap price"}
{"text":"This place use to be a very good establishment but after tonight I will not be eating there.  I found a clump of hair in my food and no one understood why I didn't want to go back up and get more food.  Still had to pay for my meal even though I did not eat it and the situation was handled very poorly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times that I lost count.  I see that in some of the reviews, people are expecting this Chinese restaurant to serve good sushi on par with a Japanese restaurant.  Double Dragon buffet is NOT a destination for sushi, but Chinese food.  By definition, Sushi is a Japanese food.  If you stick to the Chinese food dishes, you're going to be fine.  The taste and quality is above average, and yes, on occasion, you will get a dried piece of chicken.  If you want sushi, go to a Japanese buffet, like Kumo.

Still my favorite Chinese buffet!"}
{"text":"I am on the road and found this place.  I like it very much.  food was fresh and hot.  service was polite and prompt.  price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened, which is roughly the past 20 years.  The early years were awesome, great value, so busy, so fresh.  It has slowly been going downhill.

My wife and I ate here for New Years Eve a few years ago and it was still pretty good, 4 out of 5 stars.  Have gone about once every few months in recent years.

We went back this past Sunday, first time in about 6 months, and wow, the trend seems to be escalating.

Men's room had a little bit of graffiti.

Wok area for 'custom' stir fry was never manned; I didn't bother to ask.

Boneless spare ribs were disgusting, tons of cartiledge and fat.  More of that than meat.

Chicken on a stick, a regular favorite of my 6 year old's, was found to be tough and dried out.

General tso's - very chewy meat, overbreaded on top of that.  I shouldn't even call it meat, makes me sick thinking about it.

The spring roll my wife bit into was terrible, the oil literally came pouring out!

The won ton I tried seemed to be a day old.  The dough was tough and dry.

The hot tea was not good.  Weak and poor taste.

I was sick the next morning.  Now maybe it wasn't from this meal, I can't say for sure.

Since they are fairly close to home and since we have been patrons from the very beginning, I will probably give them one more chance.  In a few months, when hopefully they have had the time to make some changes.  If they improve, I will definitely come back here and update the review as I have for other reviews before.

Update 11/10/14
I promised we'd give it another shot.  We went yesterday.  The pineapple chicken is quite stringy.  Chicken on a stick was decent this time.  General Tso's didn't feel like good chicken.  Crab rangoons were very short on filling compared to better places.  Bathrooms are again kind of nasty, not necessarily disgusting but beat up and in disrepair.  They've made a couple improvements, I will bring them up to 2 stars. The value isn't bad and the selection is huge, but there's a reason teh tables aren't packed."}
