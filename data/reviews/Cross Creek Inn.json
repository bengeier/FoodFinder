{"text":"The Cross Creek Inn has always been a local favorite. Nothing fancy, but good food and great service. The wings are real whole wings done perfectly. Prices are very reasonable. I would recommend Cross Creek to anyone looking for a good meal in Elizabeth."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about this restaurant. It was a bit of a let down. We stumbled upon cross creek inn on the way to round hill and decided to try it out for dinner. Upon walking in I was impressed just from the decorations and atmosphere. I definitely thought we were going to have a great meal. The place was nicely painted and had life sized wizard of oz statues which were pretty neat. No-one greeted us when we walked in so after a few minutes we had a seat. The waitress came over and brought us menus, which were printed on computer paper. My first thought was the prices were a tad more than I thought they would be. 7 dollars for frozen to fried cheesesticks, 14 dollars for 3 chicken fajitas...  We ordered out food and we waited, and waited. My daughter dropped a crayon under the table and while picking it up i noticed an old plastic pepsi cup and napkin under the table. My friend first got his nachos he picked as his side for his meal, they were just store bought chips and salsa. Then we waited some more. It took a half hour to get out food and we were the only table. I got mine, a chicken salad, before my friend got his chicken fajitas. The salad was okay but nothing memorable. About ten minutes later my friend got his meal, he wasn't impressed either. Our bill came to 30 dollars. Took about an hour on a half overall."}
{"text":"Six months later after new management breakfast service was started. Terrible. It even looked bad. Black flavorless home fries. Eggs unevenly cooked. Rye toast crumbled. Bacon rubbery. Coffee...yuk! After this second visit there will be no more. Sad.  The waitress was pleasant. Wish her well."}
{"text":"New owners, Blaine Hill BBQ  Brisket was decent but not over the top, a bit dry BBQ sauce was good.  Pulled pork was also dry.  Fresh cut fries had uncooked fries in the batch.  Beer Batter fries were crisp and good.  Cole slaw was decent.  Service was very slow, over 1 1/2 hours to get 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in between wedding and reception. Knew nothing about Droopy's. Enjoyed beer, grilled buffalo chicken wrap, hot ham & cheese sandwich, and ribs. Everything totally decent. Hand cut fries were okay - need to be double fried and they will be better!"}
{"text":"Used to visit on wed for wing night which were fantastic but hadn't been in awhile decided to stop in with a friend early afternoon, place only had two other patrons. I mentioned it had an odd smell as soon as we walked in the door like an old sour smell and the table I sat down at was sticky where it meets the wall...My friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato...the bun fell apart as soon as she tried to cut into it...was so stale...and the tomato was little cherry salad tomatoes cut in half...waitress was friendly took it off her bill...but on the way out my friend pointed up at the ceiling vents that were covered completely in dust. That would be a huge reason to not go back....wish I would have looked up on the way in....should be zero stars"}
