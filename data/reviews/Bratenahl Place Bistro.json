{"text":"Stay away. Food is inconsistent. Strong chance you will be overcharged. Don't use a credit card there. They will charge you if you want to substitute....unheard of from any other restaurant!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has huge potential but currently has some shortcomings. First the entrees really don't seem to change much at all. And the choices are rather limited. Steaks are good but salmon not so much. Garlic mashed potatoes tasted like last week's offerings. The few times we have eaten here the dessert menu seemed sparse. In fact one Thursday evening they only had ice cream! In winter! Prices are on the expensive side! Compare quality to price with Edwin's or Le Petit Triangle and there is no comparison. Examine the menu at 185 bistro, which is far more interesting and inviting! Location is fantastic for those who live in Euclid or Bratenahl. But it's not worth the drive from Highland Heights or Mentor.   Interestingly, during our last visit, the service people told us the previous restaurant was outstanding. When I asked why they replied that the menu was creatively and tastefully done, and this had earned the past chef a loyal following. They seemed less than enthusiastic about the current product. Pity we did not try the past restaurant.   In summary if you are in the area and would like to have dinner by the lake, don't mind mediocre bar food, an under equipped bar, ice cream for dessert, and have money to burn, there's a table here for you."}
{"text":"Wonderful, amazing hidden gem with top notch service. Andrew and David took such good care of us! We had such an amazing time and the food was delicious as were the drinks. I was especially impressed with the high quality of personal service we received. We were a large party and they made each of us feel special and accommodated us including our various dietary restrictions. I live in Chicago where we have an abundance of high quality restaurants and this exceeded our expectations. Such a lovely, unexpected jewel of a place. I recommend them highly. The food is absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night was excellent. I had Linguini with clam sauce and a Caesar salad. Guests enjoyed Veal Parmigiano and Pasta Bolognese.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Slick little secret. Food is outstanding! Chef Kaiser has done a outstanding job and the front end is efficient. Great speciality drinks!"}
{"text":"We ordered a house salad and deep dish pepperoni pizza. Both had fresh ingredients, the pizza was one of the best in the area. Plenty of toppings with a flavorful crust and sauce. The salad has a lettuce mix, carrots and cucumber. The dressing was house made and was a tasty vinaigrette."}
{"text":"I had the pistachio crusted salmon last week.   It was the best piece of salmon that I can ever remember, and prepared to perfection"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the space that was formerly Americano. The new owner Gino and his wife are very attentive and welcoming. One welcome change is that this place now serves pizza every day, small and large sizes, both for here and to go. It's a great addition to Bratenahl.  Overall they do serve excellent food. The salads are large and always fresh. The prime rib dinner is a large serving size and a great weekly special. It was incredibly tender and full of flavor, and the mashed potatoes were perfect. The gnocchi is awesome! Service is great.  My only complaint is that the bar (while aesthetically improved) is not what it used to be, meaning the alcohol selection is smaller, both beer and liquor. They are missing things like any kind of bitters selection for mixed drinks that you would find in other bars of this caliber and genre, which severely limits their mixed drink classics. In place of these classic items they have disappointingly added some lower quality drinks like 99 Bananas to the menu. Gino if you are reading this please visit the bar at Greenhouse Tavern, Flying Fig, The Fairmount, Velvet Tango Room, Edwin's to get an idea of the quality/ingredients served in the drinks at these Cleveland bars. Bratenahl Place Bistro bar should be right up there with these guys, just like your food already is."}
{"text":"We're local. We were giant, loyal fans of Americano; it was so fantastic every. single. time. that it was hard for us to go anywhere else when we were wondering where to go for dinner. In addition to our regular dining there, our extended family also hosted a rehearsal dinner and a few wedding and baby showers there.  We loved the Americano staff; we knew their names and they knew ours. So we really really REALLY didn't like how the Americano owners were treated by the Bratenahl Place condo board, and we nit-picked the replacement, whatever its name, the couple times we tried to give it a fair chance. So it has been a good long time since our last visit.  But, we what the heck went there tonight and really really REALLY enjoyed it. I wanted to finish the leftover Thai sauce that came with the shrimp appetizer with my spoon. My husband raved about his steak (he's not prone to raving). The server was kind and attentive to our young children. We will be back, next time enthusiastically.  I am only docking a star out of loyalty to the former owners (you should go check out Citizen Pie)."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great customer service. Very cozy bar and lounge on one side with formal dining room on other side. Owners are great people and very much into customer satisfaction!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem located inside of One Bratenahl Place! The bar is such a fun place to hangout and enjoy the most delicious libations Happy Hour is awesome! The bartenders are engaging and very inviting! The food is delicious!! Gino and Ana really run this place like a home away from home!! The customer service is perfection!!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp as we driving from Detroit to Buffalo. What a surprise! First, We came to the end of the road and were told \"your destination is on your left.\" On our left was a gate into a private complex and several high rises. After driving around a bit and seeing nothing, we drove up to the gate. Yes, we were in the right place! The guard directed us where to go, though there wasn't a sign! This is actually a little restaurant for the people who own the condos--though it's open to the public. There's a little bar, a lounge area, and a lovely dining room. The staff were beyond friendly (we were the only ones there at the moment, though they assured us they do get busy) and were helpful and welcoming. The food was great!! We were just having a lite supper and split the bourbon burger with a salad. It was beyond amazing and plenty for two. The menu looked great, and we seriously considered the $5 bar bites--but the burger won us over. They told us they can't advertise as it is a private setting so rely on yelp reviews and word of mouth. This is a find!!"}
{"text":"I have long loved this location.  It has been many different restaurants, but never have I had a better meal then I did Friday night.   The reinvention of Veal Marsala as a braised roast was etherial.   The polenta light and fluffy, the sauce delicate yet full of flavor.  The Fennel Fondue was unexpectedly vinegary and sharp.   A nice change from the very rich versions I've had in the past.    The donuts with montimorency cherry sauce and coffee pot au creme was amazing.  I will be going back soon and bringing many friends."}
