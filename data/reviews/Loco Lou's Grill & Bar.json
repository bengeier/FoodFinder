{"text":"This was about my second time in the establishment, and honestly I never thought I could be such a burden to this particular bartender. Everytime she walked by she would take the empty mug of beer and SLAME it right down beside me as I'm sipping on my drink. And then when I proceeded to order a shot of clamato juice she actually had the nerve to SNARL at the polite request!... one of these manager's needs to set this disgruntled employee straight.. other than that seems like a nice place to have some beers so long as the bartenders are in a good mood??..."}
{"text":"The food is decent here, but keep in mind it is located next to SAIT so you have a younger crowd and music loud enough to prevent regular conversation.
And they wouldn't take debit cards....weird."}
{"text":"Nice patio, makes it tough to study at SAIT on a hot summer day.  If your looking for a loud, hoppin' place to get your drink on, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loco's can get crazy at times, but it's a good kind of crazy. They have an exceptional outdoor patio and drink specials that attract a lot of thirsty students since it's located across the street from SAIT.
The food is okay and the service can be spotty, but they have a nice spot and a lot of pool tables. They also celebrate events and hold huge parties like Mardi Gras, New Year's and Halloween. It's a fun place to take in."}
{"text":"Great pizza pie. Did you know Shia Laboeuf was a bartender in Calgary? He is.

Generally good caesers."}
{"text":"Jukebox don't advise it is a money competition. Paid $4 and waited more than 2h to hear my song until I quit. Anyone who pays more cuts you in line and you're obligated to listen to cheasy stuff all night. My song was only getting behind in queue. Chicken wings taste like something they bought frozen, heated a little and poured some salsa to top. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with some friends. We sat up on the roof top patio - which was nice... (Who doesn't like roof top patios?) 

We just got a bucket of corona and I ordered pork tacos, I don't know why I always order these because I never seem to like them anywhere I go... I just am a sucker for tacos. 

Overall it's ok, I wouldn't be going if I couldn't sit outside though."}
{"text":"Located right across the street from SAIT, the atmosphere of this place is usually always filled with college students. The service is casual and attentive with drinks, but food and special requests can take awhile. Being a college student myself I have spent a lot of time here.

They have a wide variety of toppings for tasty customizable thin crust pizzas, however the pizza is so thin the toppings slide right off! The best thing on the menu has got to be the spinach dip, it's so delicious i am always scraping the bowl to get every last bit on my chips or pita bread!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best staff here. They are always nice to me from the bouncers at the door to the bartenders. I left my credit card last night and they messaged me on facebook within an hour to let me know. I always have fun here.

Disclaimer I am drunk currently but sober me stands by this review."}
{"text":"If you've been a student in Calgary for any length of time, chances are you know about Loco Lou's. 

Yeah... you know what I'm talkin' about. 

With a crowd composed wholly of students, Loca Lou's is like a Bermuda Shorts Day... Every day. 

A vivacious crowd, lots of drinking, lots of noise, lots of laughs, and lots of food. 

Because pretty much everyone who hangs out here is a student, the crowd is ridiculously friendly, and by the end of the night, groups often merge with others and you have 10 more friends than you did at the beginning of the night. 

If you're lookin' for a fun and rambunctious kinda night - head on over to Loco Lou's!"}
{"text":"Right across the street from SAIT so we're talking about an easy access college kid hang out. Take that for what it is, I don't really care about the age group at my bar, I'm not judging either way and I've had some pretty damn good nights at Loco Lou's.

The space is awesome, if not untapped in potential since the building is so cool. It's on the second second floor and has a somewhat circular side loaded with giant windows that give you an amazing view of...a gas station, parking lot and 16 avenue. Ok, well.. At least they've got a view of something.

The patio is freaking spectacular and gigantic. I've only looked at it through the wintery depths of icy icy winter, but I'm counting the days until summer so I can sit in the sunshine and drink Loco Lou's super generic domestic beer selection. 

I swear I've eaten here no less than 3 times but yet I can't remember a single experience. Yet again, take it is good or bad. I've never had a bad experience, but I've also never had something memorable...

If you're in the area, do it. The evening will be what you make it. If you bring good friends Loco Lou's an alright place to hang out and drink some beers."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you how I ended up here.  Ask me how long I stayed and I'd be at a loss for words.  But I was here and I had a blast.

Generally, as I approach 30, I'm not comfortable being anywhere that makes me feel like an old man.  Unless I've been drinking.  When I've been drinking, as I was on this particular night, I will pretty much go anywhere and not care how old I look.  For me, it's vital that I'm drinking should I ever return to Loco Lou's.

Yes, the demographic at Loco Lou's is young.  But, being popular with nearby students attending SAIT and ACAD, what can you expect?  So if you're looking for a quiet night of drinking, stay away from Loco Lou's.

Our adventure that night was one of pool, drinking, running around the parking lot, more drinking, and lots of activities that you wouldn't find me doing on a normal night.  Even a normal night of drinking.  So be warned, going to Loco Lou's, or any bar that caters to students, may take you back to those days.  In my case, it did.  I'm quite sure my fiance picked me up, but I don't want to ask.  Would you?"}
{"text":"Heeeey!!! My first real patio sunburn of the season :). We popped in to Loco Lou's for a little #occupypatio action this afternoon. I hadn't been back to visit in AGES! So it was nice to get reacquainted with the place a bit.

I't s a solid spot for a sunny afternoon. Not sure why the patio wasn't busier... maybe because all of the students have gone home for the summer? Anyway, Coronas were on special, that with the traditional lime was a good way to ease in to a sunny May afternoon.

Eats wise, I filled myself with a greek wrap and side salad. It's on par with what you'd expect for a place like Lou's. Our server was on the ball with the specials and frequent check backs to make sure our drinks stayed full.

I can't say that I've ever been blown out of the water here, but I've certainly never had a bad time here."}
{"text":"Poor serivce, waited nearly 15 minutes to order a drink, then 10 minutes before said drink came out. 
Waited nearly 30 more minutes before we were asked if we wanted food, or a refill on our drinks.
The place was empty - so it's not like they were busy. This was 5pm on a Saturday.
My wife got a broken glass, which we had to send back for a fresh drink.

Food was pretty poor quality.
I got the Mac and Cheese with sausage.
The sauce tasted of undercooked/raw flour and probably oil/margarine rather than butter.
And there was only the tiniest amount of cheese on the top of it. Virtually no flavour whatsoever.
For $14 - I was expecting a gloriously cheesy feast.
I was sorely disappointed.

My wife had the chicken fingers and salad. 
Pretty hard to screw up. Run of the mill as far as her reaction.

Overall pretty poor experience.
I don't think I'd go back unless I was forced to."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
We love this place. Yes it's a lot of student and trades crowd, but it's the best patio in the city. Huge, with sun on three sides, and overhead scaffolding  with heat and lightings when the evenings get shorter and cooler.
Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying it's never a good idea to have a million stairs in a place where people are drinking.  I've seen many a people fall flat on their faces (or asses) trying to go up or down these stairs after having a few too many.  I, myself, have never fallen, but I've been close!

That being said, I still love Loco Lou's!  It's always proved to be a good time, mostly because a person falling down stairs is hilarious (if they don't hurt themselves)!  But that's not the only reason I love this place.  It's got a great environment to it.  Everyone, the staff included, is so nice and friendly.  It seems like people aren't as reluctant to buy you a drink here, even if they are a complete stranger.  A couple of times my group has actually joined with another group to make one giant group of fun!  Okay, that was cheesy, but you get it!

I don't eat from Lou's very often, but that's because we usually go to drink.  The couple of times I have ordered food it's been your typical pub stuff like nachos, wings, and potato skins, but it's always been tasty and hit the spot!

Loco Lou's makes for a darn tootin' good time!  Just be careful of those stairs after you've had a couple!"}
{"text":"Two stars because they scanned my driver's license and took my picture to enter the 15 % full bar late on Friday.
Thus immediately stopping my penchant for illegal activity, I preceded to sit on their patio.
Patios along 16th Ave are less to be desired due to the heavy amount of traffic constantly whizzing by. In contrast to 17th Ave patios, where the traffic is more of a cruising/look at my fancy car atmosphere. Here you get the semi trucks and a second story view of the Trans Canada Highway.

This is definitely a go to for SAIT students. Beer list average, when my husband asked me to order him a nice beer on his way down to meet me, my options were Coors Banquet or Velvet Fog.

There are only two bathroom stalls in the women's washroom, so if this got really busy, I can't imagine the line-up for a pee. Though while I was in the washroom, another patron decided to leave the quiet bar and go into a stall to have a phone conversation.

I used the air hand dryer really loudly to make my point.

I don't think I will be back, though frequenting bars along the Transcanada isn't my normal haunt. If your are a student, a great close escape to a large patio is just within your reach."}
