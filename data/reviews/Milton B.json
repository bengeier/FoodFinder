{"text":"This is a great place to study for free, they often do not come up and force you to buy anything, which is clutch for students. If you do feel like being a good person and buying something DO NOT get a smoothie. They taste like vomit, not 100% natural. I should be getting a free pastry for drinking half of that."}
{"text":"This place is probably my favourite studying place in the McGill Ghetto and definitely my favourite on Parc. I didn't frequent the Second Cup very much, but I'd been there enough times to notice, in my opinion, the definite improvements. For one, I love the new lighting! The lighting had been one of the main reasons I disliked studying at the Second Cup in the past. The other reason had been the rather awkwardly placed tables. Milton B improved this greatly with their large tables; in fact, my favourite place to sit is the big table in the middle.  As for what they serve, I have yet to try any food there since I tend to come after supper (I'm super glad they kept the open 24 hours feature). The drinks are nice, not too overpriced, and the teas come on the cutest bamboo board. Once the semester starts, I think I'll become more of a regular. But for now, there's more of the city to be seen!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to study, chill, or just hangout with friends. Always trying to improve their menu. Prices are fair and the terrace is perfect!"}
{"text":"Best 24hr spot in the area. Awesome wifi. Great options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks."}
{"text":"As basically the only 24 hour café in the area with outlets, I need it more than I love it, quite frankly. Service has always been quite nice, decor is clean, there's a good variety of seats (high, low, comfy), enough outlets, and WiFi is almost always good - it's just the prices that keep me from gushing."}
{"text":"Milton B has the best chocolate croissant! Try one, and you'll thank me later. We were in town last month and wanted to get smoothies.  This place was closed to our hotel downtown.  It was late afternoon, and it was busy with students.  They have a pretty large seating area outside.  Inside was also packed.  The young lady behind the counter was very friendly.  She greeted us, and recommended her favorite pastry while I was looking at the case. My husband had a strawberry banana smoothie, and he liked it.  The pastry case looked so good! So, I decided to get, not one, but two chocolate croissants.  I seriously wished that I've gotten two more.  They were warm, crispy, and so good. The place was definitely too crowded for me to sit back and relax, but looked like a great hangout spot.  I will visit again next time I'm in Montréal."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop EVER! Trust me - Take it from me as a regular happy client :) MILTON B, the newly urban cafeteria has been my place and the place of many people to have a delicious \"third wave\" coffee, 100% natural smoothie, freshly prepared baked foods while being super productive, read, relax, meet interesting people that last a lifetime in a friendly ecological, sustainable and communal environment. There is 2 private meeting areas if you need privacy as well. (You can rent the space for free only if you buy coffee and some food) BEST PART? It's Open 24 Hrs A Day & You get your money's worth! ;"}
{"text":"After spending many nights here this past school year, here are my thoughts. I appreciate that it is 24 hours. The vegetarian grilled cheese is especially delicious and I usually don't like pesto. The vegetarian pizza is also good and I usually don't like olives. I am not a fan of the drinks, especially the coffee/espresso ones. Matcha latte is also a no for me. The teas are a good deal if you're saying for a long time-- $5 and you can get refills. I recommend the dragon pearl jasmine tea but tbh all jasmine teas are great. It can get quite packed at times but all in all a very convenient cafe."}
{"text":"Good location to study and tables for groups .. latte 2.50 on Tuesdays.. staff was nice.. that's about all I have to say that's remotely positive  unfortunately..  the almond croissant is worst then one I would get it IGA and the coffee is worst then a Keurig cup .. It's too bad they don't have BYOC (bring your own coffee) then I'd come back to study.."}
{"text":"Café urbain située sur la rue Parc, proche de Mcgill, ouvert 24h.   Ambiance agréable, grande terrasse avec des prises électriques, super pour une journée ensoleillée comme aujourd'hui.  Ma limonade glacée au melon d'eau était vraiment bon :)"}
{"text":"I had the London Fog which taste more milk than tea but other than that the place is a good place to study and hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Milton B replaces the iconic second cup cafe at the du parc street. I have spend many a study/recreational hours at the previos second cup. So when Milton B opened finally after the long wait, I was one of the few first ones to check it out. The ambience of the plcae is refreshing, bright and beautifully furnished with light wood chic furniture.  I would definitely be a regular here as well. They offer the normal tea/cafe options with a variety of eating options as well."}
{"text":"Finally a place where Wi-Fi works in this city, and finally a local coffee shop owner that apparently understands the importance of reliable Wi-Fi. Terrace has always been awesome, and still is. Great 24h location."}
{"text":"I was in total shock when I walked by what used to be a 24 hour Second Cup and saw that it was being replaced by Milton B, a 24 hour urban cafeteria.  The Second Cup had been there ever since I first step foot on McGill campus way back when.  It was a very popular study spot with the McGill crowd given its operating hours and proximity to the campus.  Everybody came here when they were a student be it to study or fuel up for a long night of partying.  Anyways, enough nostalgia and on to what I came here to do which is to review the business.  Being an urban cafeteria you can expect food like sandwiches and salads.  I have been twice now and on both times the sandwiches could have been a little better.  The first time I came I had a bocconcini pesto sandwich which needed to be toasted longer because the cheese had only half melted.  The second time around I had an apple brie grilled cheese sandwich which was better except they used raisin bread which I found a little odd.  I also noticed that the first time I went the salad selection was a little lacklustre but on my return visit it had improved, which makes me think that they were still trying to work out the kinks of being a new business.  The salads are pretty tasty for the most part.  You can get salads that are substantial enough to be a whole meal or smaller ones to accompany a sandwich.  They also have a variety of baked goods and sweets if you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth. In general the ones that I have tried have been quite fresh and delicious.  I enjoyed them and they did satisfy my craving for something sweet.  When it comes to prices they are what you would expect to pay downtown.  Depending on what you order you can easily get a filling lunch for somewhere between $10 and $15, which is what you can expect to pay in this area of Montreal.  I do feel that you get your money's worth here.  The portions are ample and the quality of the food is pretty good.  While this isn't a place offering super cheap eats I can see it doing well with the McGill crowd.  Given the fact that it is a 24 hour place and that they offer coffee and food it would make for a good study spot.  Even if you are not  student it is worth checking Milton B out because they do offer a better alternative to some of the other food court fare that exists downtown."}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas fan du chaï mais celui du Milton B m'a conquise! Ici, pas d'infect sirop comme dans certaines chaînes de cafés (qui servent du café tout aussi imbuvable). Un savant mélange de thé et d'épices plein de parfums enivrants. Un peu cher, le chaï du Milton B?  Le nombre de gousses de cardamome qu'on y met justifie à lui seul le prix,  je dirais. Le café est bien. Mais lorsque je demande que l'on réchauffe la tasse,  j'aimerais bien qu'on le fasse. Les sandwichs sont appétissants. Les gâteaux offerts,  quoique corrects, sont les mêmes que ceux offerts dans les chaînes. Je me demande ce qu'il y a de si compliqué dans la confection d'un bon gâteau maison? C'est le genre de détails qui rend un endroit incontournable et qui lui donne une personnalité. Sinon, il fait bon s'y attabler sur la magnifique terrasse!"}
{"text":"Worst service in Montreal. The guy making the coffee is very rude; I can't believe he hasn't been fired yet."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce café dans un article de Mtl blog. Curieuse, j'ai décidé de passer une nuit entre 1h et 4h à y étudier, la vie d'étudiante c'est pas facile.  Le café est vraiment bien agencé, il y a des tables simples, de collaboration, d'autres sur-élévés et des bars puis, il y a des prises partout, une bonne luminosité et même des écrans de télévision. L'endroit était vraiment propre et accueillant et il y a vraiment beaucoup de choix de sandwichs, salades, gateaux, viennoiseries.   J'ai décidé de prendre un chaï latté earl grey. Il m'a couté 5$ et des poussières, c'est un peu cher mais comme c'est un café ouvert 24h, je dirais que c'est compréhensif.   Mais par contre, les feuilles de Earl grey (sans poche) ont étés versés dans une tasse avec un peu d'eau chaude et du lait. Le serveur m'a ensuite donné une autre tasse pour que je puisse transvaser la préparation et le boire sans les feuilles de thé. C'était too much mais le pire c'est que ce n'était pas vraiment bon. J'ai été pas mal déçu, moi la fan de Chaï latté.   Je compte y retourner mais je vais surement changer ma commande."}
{"text":"Ouvert 24h , grande terrasse et bcp de tables avec un peu de verdure autour, café et petite restauration raisonable."}
{"text":"Great location and finally an accessible place that's open 24hrs! Good coffee as well. Haven't tried tried sandwiches yet"}
