{"text":"A cozy, dim-lit place to have a date or catch up with friends with some good cocktails."}
{"text":"The Comrade serves the best cocktails I've had. And I've been lots of places. Their freshest most delicious (to me) is the one with cucumber and gin (can't remember the name now). There is a slice of cucumber wrapped inside the glass so it's pretty and i always end up eating it, which is the perfect finish. And then I ask for another one.  Extensive list of bourbon and whiskey as well which suits my man just fine.   But their best seller must be their hot dog. It's pretty incredible. We went pretty late on a Friday once and ordered two of those. The kitchen was almost closed and we waited for 30 minutes but still no hot dogs. The waitress realized they forgot and ran to the kitchen to see if someone could still make them for us. Not only did we get them, but they gave them to us for free to apologize for the wait.  Customer service doesn't get better then that.   Overall, fantastic cocktails, good food and great staff. Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"The Comrade is one of the neatest neighbourhood lounges I have come across as of late.  It's dark. It's a little mysterious. It's perfect for handing out with friends over drinks.  The place is filled with plush chairs and feels like there are lots of nooks and crannies to sink into.  During the summer they open the large front windows and let the street life flow in.    Service is great with a no pressure attitude.  The have a wide variety of beers and bevvies to choose from.  Lots of unique options you don't find in your everyday bar."}
{"text":"Nice spot, great service good cocktails. Perfect place to take someone for a drink in a nice atmosphere without having to venture from the East end."}
{"text":"Great bar.  Went their last weekend at around 9pm on a Saturday night.  We were 4 ppl and had no problem getting a table.  We ordered and few drinks and they were all delicious. We then got hungry and decided to order a bunch of food to share.  We literally ordered most of the menu.  It was delicious !! I would absolutely recommend the charcuterie board and the cevice- they were my favorite.    The burger and ribs were also delicious!  This place had an excellent atmosphere (not pretentious, very fun).  Will definitely be returning in the future !"}
{"text":"i'd sell my mom for their mac and cheese. great cocktails, too. staff is awesome."}
{"text":"AMAZING  Vladamir.  But this is no ordinary Czar bar, in fact service is speedy but not rushin' either.  Over 50 beers and a wide selection of wine blah blah...fine..., but what sets The Comrade apart is the attention to cocktail detail.  Each drink is specifically garnished and cupped accordingly with masterful detail.    My favourite 2 favourite drinks here are:  - Dark & Stormy - Comrade garnishes this with candied ginger - Old Fashioned - Very strong  The service was spectacular, my vegan date (though she's not cheesy or a vegetable) couldn't eat much on the pork belly infused menu so the hostess told us we could pop 2 blocks down to get some vegan cupcakes and bring them back to the restaurant to eat them.  Most restaurants fear competing cupcakes--this one embraced it... thanks Comrade."}
{"text":"Our favourite spot to take friends, have a few casual cocktails and some good conversation. They recently redid the menu, adding a few new great drinks. I hope this place sticks around because it's a local favourite!"}
{"text":"A bunch of colleagues and I headed there after the dismal service we received at Boots and Bourbon down the street.  I felt like I was in a little speakeasy in New York when I walked in there.  From the fabulous ambiance to the attentive wait staff to the fantastic drinks, this little bar is a real gem!  On a side note, we were still drinking after the kitchen closed and a few patrons came in looking for a bite to eat.  The chef who was still on site opened up the kitchen for them so they could have a meal.  You definitely don't see service like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and design of this cozy place. So many cool vintage touches, including that great Grand Central Hotel sign and the art deco doors into the kitchen. The menu is fantastic, the service friendly and the music is great but not overly loud. A really special neighbourhood hangout."}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday??!!  How can a bar be closed on Sunday? I was really disappointed as I went one day and they were closed... Boo!"}
{"text":"I'd say this is an amazing place for a leisurely evening with girlfriends over many cocktails, but for our requirements of a quick impromptu dinner it was a bit disappointing.  Our party of three arrived looking for a meal after some other neighborhood restaurants were entirely booked out for the evening. The simple menu and dark, eclectic setting enticed us in.  We were seated immediately but I got the sense that our server lost interest and effort once we only ordered one alcoholic drink between the three of us (we did specify we were looking for dinner upon arrival)  We ordered the ceviche, the burger and the Korean pork belly. All three of us had the same verdict- nice food (although the ceviche was too heavy on the lime) but disappointing portion sizes. Definitely not \"dinner\" as the menu described, and more like bar snacks.  My orange juice was really watery and unenjoyable, boo!   I got the sense that the staff wanted us to leave ASAP after we finished our meals because we weren't going to rack up a huge tab. I really hope I'm wrong about this as it is a gorgeous place and I will definitely return to try some of their amazing cocktails - but I won't be ordering food next time."}
{"text":"I booked the back room for a party (minimum 25 people) and had an excellent time at The Comrade.  When we were first told that there was no wait service I was a little worried, but the bar is small enough that there is never a long line to wait for a drink and they were happy to start tabs with anyone.  The beer list is fantastic. The cocktails are solid. And I've been told the wine list isn't anything to sneeze at either.  The vibe is very easy and fun, but definitely more of a place to hang out with your friends than to meet new ones.  The back room is like the rec room of an older Russian man who likes to travel and has seen the world. There are several different benches and chairs so that your party can separate into easily digestible groups. It's also wide open so that everyone can easily mix into the hallway and towards the bar.  The rest of the bar is also elegantly designed. The tin ceiling, a brick wall behind the bar, and an assortment of Communist propaganda posters on the walls.  If I lived in the east end I feel like I would be a Comrade regular."}
{"text":"My comrade (read: roommate) introduced me and everyone else to The Comrade for her birthday party which was pretty cool because I would not venture all the way out there for a bar.  It was dark in there, and usually good things happen at darkly lit, hip places (err... or bad things, depends on your skewed interpretations). It was also packed when I got there, which was another sure sign that it's happening. Her party was in the back part of the lounge so I didn't get to mingle and see what the crowd was like but I tolerate it. I'd go back and check it out again. (They only had one bathroom stall per gender though?)  The big downer of the night was when I was paying for a few rounds of drinks. The first bartender short changed me for a round, which she acknowledged and apologized for. Then, for another my second round, I had some bills plus a $5 bill in my hand to give to the bartender (a different one). I later switched this five to a twenty, but she refused to believe me. Since I was only having a couple of drinks, I knew full well what bills I gave her and didn't but at this point it was my word against hers. She spoke to me in a extremely condescending way like \"you're drunk, you don't know what you're talking about\" which I really did not appreciate. So, she pretty much just robbed me of $20. Ugh, thinking about her tone of voice and facial expression brings back unpleasant feelings. Moral of the story: just watch out for your change when you pay here I guess."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in Toronto. Supremely underrated tapas and arguably the best burger you'll get in the GTA."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have delicious comfort food and great beer/cocktail selection. But my only gripe is the music is too loud especially if you are there on a Friday after work, you want to be able to chill and hear what the other person is saying."}
{"text":"Two of us went there last night after reading some of the reviews and I have to say I agree with the burger being scrumptious! The decor was trendy and I specially loved the low light and the cozy ambiance. I had the Shrimp and Chorizo which was tasty but would have been even better if there was more chorizo and shrimp and less potatos (85% of the dish was roasted potatoes). I also had the Glera Proviamo sparkling wine, which I would deffinitely recommend if you are into dry and flavourful sparkling wines. It was so good, I had 2 glasses actually, and the $10 price tag helped too. My companion shared a burger with me, which was almost the best burger I ever had. Juicy and flavourfull cut of meat! Over all the prices were very reasonable compared to simillar establishments in the area, service was friendly, and above all the food was good. I would definitely add this place to my list of favourites in Leslieville."}
{"text":"This gorgeous lounge is owned by former furniture store owners, which explains the eclectic (and gorgeous!) decor.  The front and back rooms are the same, yet different, with dim lighting and soft, cushiony couches great for snuggling on or getting comfy with a few of your closest friends.  The bar staff are really friendly and their beer selection is far superior to any other establishment in the area.  Beware though - you will want to try every drink on the menu and their prices are not conducive to adventurous types."}
{"text":"I like it here. It's expensive, but worth it for a great cocktail. Food servings are on the smaller side.  We stumbled in here after our wedding at Ruby Watchco and they served our table of 4 complimentary champagne, which was really nice of them."}
{"text":"I could not have designed a better place to get drinks in the Queen East neighborhood. The Comrade is newly redesigned with a combination of brick walls, modern furniture and old signs and wall hangings it is a designer's dream.   The drink menu is pages long, made up primarily of pages of beer and wine.  There is, however, a great selection of house-made cocktails.  I tried both the Gin Fizz with elderflower and the Dark and stormy, a rum and ginger beer delight on a hot summer night.   There are also an array of typical top shelf liquors.   We sat in the front, super comfy chairs, but ventured back to explore the lovely bar stools and the back room would be great for a private event.   The servers and owners are adorable. The night we were there, Dean, the bartender was all daper in bowtie and vest. A real 'old-fashion' experience."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. The staff was very friendly to the four of us and helped us with any questions and recommendations. The drink menu is fantastic. The beer list itself is reason to go back.   We ordered a charcuterie plate and chips. The charcuterie plate could be a little fuller but the items on it were delicious. I had a lot of fun there and am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Love the atmosphere, love the decor, love the service....love, love, love. I wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Went last night with a bunch of friends for a few Friday night drinks. Tip #1: this is not a good place to come with a group. The biggest table can accommodate 6, but they don't take reservations. So we divided up between a few tables, which was totally fine because the place is cozy and we were still pretty close to each other. It is pretty dark inside and it feels more like you are in a living room than communist Russia, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless.   They have a long beer, whiskey and bourbon list, and a ton of speciality cocktails. Be warned....don't come here if you are hungry. We spent a lot of time online looking for their website to see if they have food. They do, but only charcuterie plates. They looked tasty, but we wanted an actual meal.   The service was friendly and pretty good, considering that it was super busy by the time we left. All of the tables at the front and their bar seats were spoken for.  They had a big room at the back that you could reserve. I made a mental note of this for my next birthday as it looked like the perfect spot: lots of seating, quiet enough to talk, but you didn't feel like you were locked away in some room. Also, the music is AMAZING, if you are into old-school Britpop, Motown and other random and awesome stuff."}
{"text":"What a gem! I'm a big fan of the eastend and this place is awesome. Great music, chill vibe and great crowd. The charcuterie board had wonderful presentation and a great variety of meats and cheeses. It is quite small which is what I love most about it  so it is quite intimate but I could see it feeling squishy when it's packed. Drinks deals  are standard. Definitely will go  back."}
{"text":"Brilliant!   Went on a Friday night for a casual pint with a friend and zero expectations...  walked away with a new favorite T.O. bar!  The staff were AMAZING - sat at the bar and watched the detail that went into making every drink (seriously!!). Lots of good looking people, friendly atmosphere and killer tunes!  A must if ur in the east end... but get there early if you want a seat."}
{"text":"I remembered reading about this place on Yelp, and how it got such good reviews, so when I walked by today and was starving, I immediately suggested we go in for late lunch/early dinner.   We got there at 5:05, so just as the place had opened.  As such, it was dead, and we were the only people in there.  Sometimes, this scenario in restaurants leads to really good service, because they've got nothing else to do.  But sometimes (as was the case today), it means you're basically ignored because they aren't really in the swing of things yet.  It bothers me when you can SEE servers goofing off instead of serving you - having a dance party, switching the CDs, stopping to taste some beers from an alcohol salesguy that stopped by.  All this, while we sat and waited.  We were in a rush, so I figured when our first dish got brought out, I'd let the guy know - \"We're in a rush, so can we get the bill?\" I said, even though we still had two more dishes to come out.  I figured this was clear enough.  The chef would bring out a dish, and the server would take his SWEET TIME bringing it to us.  I have no idea why.  Maybe he was bitter he was missing the gorgeous day.  The food was just ok.  \"Hot dogs\" are a guessing game, as that's all that's written on the menu.  Two mini dogs came, one was okay, the other was really not very good.  Mac and cheese was literal and nothing special - no \"other\" flavours, just macaroni with pretty ordinary cheese.  Smoky ribs were way over smoked, almost to the point that I couldnt eat mine.    Two stars because I loved the decor and the ambiance of the place.  I am sad I didn't get the good experience everyone else seems to have."}
{"text":"What can I say... Finally went there last night and I looooved it!! The place is sick. Perfect size, amazing decor, fantastic neighborhood. Hands down my favorite cocktail bar in town. I probably tried half the cocktail menu and I wish I had tried the other half... Had penicillin, manhattan, dark and stormy, Seoul man, and I forget the rest but they were all amazing and served to remember."}
{"text":"Our dinner was really good. I had the charcuterie plate and my fiance had the pork belly tacos.  I didn't order any cocktails but they had a lot to choose from.  It has a very intimate atmosphere, dark and kind of mysterious.  I dug it."}
{"text":"Love this bar.  One of my good friends who is an Eastie brought me here and we went back tonight.  It is dark, but welcoming.  It is a bit hipster, but pleasant.  And I'm sorry, if you work in that area you are a true hipster and not an Annex hipster.    Staff are really laid back and nice - the drink selection is KILLER and you will find some gems on the list.  They also have a season beverage menu which is awesome.  They also don't bother you all the time - they come after they realize you're done your drink, not 100 times in between.  A definite must if you have graduated from the tacky \"see and be seen\" crowds of Toronto to a more laid-back cool."}
{"text":"Hot damn!!!!! I went in after work, just wanting a burger and beer. I was not expecting the best burger I have ever had. Ever.  Hot damn!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with friends and this place was packed. Which meant service was super slow. Took over 20 minutes to get drinks. Interesting choice of decor with a very mixed crowd.   Despite crappy service that night, the cocktails were good and we tried the pork belly and quail egg toast which was delicious. Based on that sampler of food, I'm curious to come back and try some of their other food offerings.  Torn between returning to try more food but facing the possibility of poor service."}
{"text":"Lovely cocktails, great vibes! The East end continues to impress me.   You can't go wrong with any cocktails they have. The drinks were made fairly fast considering how much effort and detail each drink takes.   The burger was also very delicious. It's topped with a pickle!   Only issue is that we ordered something else on the menu that took way too long, and had to cancel it because we were on the way to a concert."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! One of the best bars in the east end.  The name threw me. No offense to mother Russia, but vodka bars ain't my scene, and I assumed that's what the Comrade would be. Nope.  20+ excellent beers, a page of classic and modern cocktails, and another page full of whiskey. They've got a new bar menu with tacos, ribs, fried chicken, and something called buttered kimchee. The space is cozy but not crowded and the prices are perfectly reasonable.  The Strokes, The Cure, Queen, Metric - I had to ask.  \"Where are you getting this excellent music?\" \"Mostly from the 90s.\"  Staff with wit, that pushes them over the top. 5-stars. But don't tell everyone, okay? Let's keep this place under the radar, leave the riffraff over at Jilly's. It's run by the same folks who run Goods and Provisions down the street, so expect tasty food and lots of Bourbon.  Pro-tip: Get a table by the front on a nice night, and you can roll up the garage-style windows to watch Leslieville go by.  Pro-tip: Their special in-house cocktails are surprisingly great. Last night it was the \"Rosada,\" a dry hibiscus and pernod sock-rocker of a beverage.  Pro-tip: Kalbi beef tacos. Keep it on the DL."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The spot seemed very dark and dim but it just added to the relaxed and chill atmosphere in the place. I don't think this place is really meant for food but they still did a great job with it. The Mac and cheese was really good, two types of cheese mixed into it but had a grainy kind of texture to it but all in all still really good. The pulled pork seemed as if it was crafted by the Gods. Not to sauces but not too dry and amazing taste. The deviled eggs are great starters nice cooling and refreshing snake but with a little kick of spice. Wicked and unique choices of drinks. Prices seem reasonable and portions are just right. Only down side is the the service, kinda slow but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"Sean will take care of you. Buttered kimchi rocks.  Love the interior decor.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend Evelyn W to try the poutine but they had hotdogs on the menu and when a place has hot dogs on the menu I don't try and fight it.  They were both delish but the Korean style one wasn't my fave but still wouldn't kick it out of a BBQ bed....or any bed for that matter.   Bonus points for having chess sets at the back of the place...CHESS!"}
{"text":"Alright comrades, this bar happens to be one of many close to home, and really does have a crazy extensive laundry list of drinks and cocktails that are very good. It's practically the only bar in Riverside that can qualify as a hipster joint.  Maybe once in a blue moon I will stop in here, and take in the dark atmosphere of something between a 1920s speakeasy and a Commie-themed gentlemen's den, cluttered with what surely must be a collection of flea market finds that will make a vintage home decorator drool. Maybe you'll also enjoy the many different mix of tables and seats to choose from to annex for a couple hours with a comrade or two.  And then one day... it actually occurred to me to eat something from this place. The Comrade features a small menu of oysters, comfort grub, and food a friend describes as \"Asian-condiment-enlightened hipster food\".  Like for example their Comrade Burger. That stuff is made with hoisin sause and sriracha mayo. As someone who grew up adding sriracha to everything long before the white man discovered it, I am not sure what to make of 'sriracha mayo'. I found the combination of the burger's condiments to be a sweet, lightly spicy, juicy mix akin to barbeque sauce. The burger itself though was about the size of a stack of Eggo waffles, and comes with a side of chips. By 'chips', I don't mean the fish-and-chips kind--what they'll give you will knock your socks off. It will be the most hilariously surprising thing you will have ordered from a food-serving establishment all month... and I can't believe you or I paid $10 for it.  I think they need to step up in the food department (especially if their similarly-themed sibling bar Goods and Provisions a few blocks way further east makes better food). But you can count on the staff here on being chill."}
{"text":"Love it here!  It's where I discovered Fruli!  The drinks are great, and decor is fab - and everyone must try one of their cheese trays (they have a little something for everyone)"}
{"text":"If Prohibition Gastropub is such a hit, why would I wait this long to visit it's sister pub down the street? Because there is no website?... don't let this deter you because you are missing out!  I walked in to a speakeasy that had a very dark interior but had backlit signs that made it very 1980's with a swanky atmosphere. Fancy cursive writing on the walls with candles lit throughout.... it was a hip place to be.  This place screams cocktails if you're looking for a fancy drink.... and the bar / wait staff definitely know their stuff. The speed that the bartender was shaking the drink... looked like his arm was going to fall off... it was very fascinating to watch.  Two shaken bourbon hours and tuna ceviche with house made chips, there was nothing but smiles from ear to ear. Yes it can be a little loud to communicate but really, just sit back relax and remember to come back the following weekend to try a new concoction."}
{"text":"C is for Comrade, which is good enough for me.  This might come into your head as you pass the big C outside the draped windows of The Comrade on queen street.  this place is soooo snazzy.  the walls are bare brick, the ceilings are high, and all the furniture is so nice you might feel like abandoning your own home to live here.  the chairs are big and cushiony, the tables low in between them and the distance between you and your drinking partner is perhaps a little more widespread than is conducive to easy conversation.  If you hang out in the back room, which seems to be the smooching, get cozy room, youll have more than enough couch and rug space to keep the mood cuddly.    Now, me, i like to sit at the bar mostly, because i can sample all their exciting beer and drink choices.  my new favorite is the \"dead guy\" beer from oregon - yes i tried it because of the name, but i have since ordered more of them so take that.  and one of the owners, has a signature drink whose name i cant remember currently, but it is a very festive, sweet combo cocktail.  They do have food there, which i havent tried, (its more of a bar than a restaurant)  but from talking with one of the owners, im pretty sure that its little gourmet treats that are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm rarely in the east end so I trusted Yelp! To help me find someplace for a quick drink and a bite. The rave reviews for the burger intrigued me but I was sceptical. No longer. Why The Comrade isn't on every best burger in the city list I have no idea. If only they had some decent beer on draft it would be five stars"}
{"text":"Love this place: perfect first date spot, as the lighting is nice and dim and the music isn't blaring so you can actually hear each other talk. Drinks are standard pricing, but I was impressed with the variety of gin they had avail. Being a gin drinker, it's the little things ;)"}
{"text":"I get around...and not just in the sexual sense ;)   I also get around to bars. Many, many....many bars. (I love drinking and socializing, sue me!) So for whatever that's worth, I'm awarding this particular bar five stars because they nail it on all counts....vibe, decor, music, cocktails, food, lack of pretension.  Actually it feels like an NYC bar (think East Village/Lower East Side etc)...and I only say that about bars with a certain 'je ne sais quoi' coolness factor. This place has it in spades.  To be honest, we only ate charcuterie (cheese/meat selections) and veggie potstickers, but both dishes were done exceptionally well. Cocktails were great too.   Next time I'm getting around (tonight perhaps?) I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, slow service, won't return.   Took 20 minutes to place our drink orders and shortly afterwards we were asked to switch tables (we were a party of 4 at a table for 6). 30 minutes in we finally received our drinks with no acknowledgement of the inconvenience. Cool decor though."}
{"text":"I no longer frequent this bar. It's a nice place to eat and drink when the music isn't too loud, but it's lost its ambience."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood lounge, mainly serving beer but has selecion of wine and cocktails ranging from 8-10$ a drink.  Fast service and great atmosphere, except they turned up the music as the crowd increased, making it harder to chat with friends."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place because we passed on the (current) smelliness and dumpiness of neighbouring Rasputin vodka bar.   This is a really good place. Atmosphere and ambience were great. It's not too busy there and the douchebaggy patronage seems to be at a surprising minimum. Maybe it was the day.  Anywho, they have a nice booze portfolio overall. Interesting cocktail menu, (a la cocktail bar - and basically just as good). Concise but impressive scotch menu (my friend is an aficionado and was impressed with a japanese one they had), and pretty good beer selection too.  The food was pretty good too, of what I tried. Assortments of gourmet-esque takes on various street and pub food.  I'll come back here."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday. Ordered olives, bread and spread, and a dozen oysters. We were a table of 3 and came here to grab a snack while we waited for a table at the Broadview. After 20 minutes we were wondering if the food would ever come but we kept drinking our cocktails and waited - at the 35 min mark we were ready to give up. My girlfriend went to pay the bill (at the bar because nobody was coming around) and as she went up our server brought the olives and bread... okay fine - but still no oysters. We start to eat the olives and then our table was ready at the Broadview. I left to go ahead so we wouldn't leave the table. The other 2 in my party stayed behind in hopes the oysters might eventually come. My girlfriend already paid for them sat down and waited another 15 min. No oysters. They left.   Never going back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for drinks, can't vouch for the food- though the menu looked small. We ordered cocktails, and mine was pretty good, though sweeter than it should have been. The description says propaganda decor but I saw none of that; the only thing \"commie\" was the red lighting. Decor is just an odd mix, really."}
{"text":"Bad experience. There was something wrong with the temperature. We were cold all the night as we couldn't even take of our coats. I will never go there again unless I hear they have found a way to set up temperature of the room."}
{"text":"The Comrade may just have the best hamburger in the city!! It's 5 stars. Order it and thank me later! The cocktails are done really well. I'm a fan of the dark and stormy. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is fun.  Where can they improve? In my opinion the music could be better and the beer options are pretty weak. I would like to see more craft beers added. Now go and eat that burger!! It's amazing"}
{"text":"We had a really nice time there New Years. But someone in the club stole the belt off my coat. I had my coat on and done up when I got there and coat was on stool next to me. But no belt when I left nor in lost and found. I don't know if clientele or others stole it. But you don't want to get drunk in this place. You need to be aware at all times.   Too bad as we would have made it a regular spot as we are new in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"VIBE  Dark. Slick looking from the outside but not as intimidating on the inside. Young professionals who just want a local to hang. Used to be interior-design focused but doesn't seem as much anymore. Everything is black. Service is quite lovely.   I DRANK/ATE  A hot toddy because I was hacking up a lung. They asked me for tea and I found it was $4 for a bag. The waitress heard our vocal scoffing so she comped me for it. Kudos to her! I love their nibbles menu and had some kettle chips with onion dip. It's a bit pricey for what it is but if you want a snack, it works.   They have an extensive list of beers and wines. Your servers can guide you through this.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  A great place for comraderie. Cue drum symbols. In comparison I do think the Avro has a bit more character. But for a catch up with friends or a one on one, this place is solid. If on a bar crawl, a good place to start the night."}
{"text":"Prime rib burger was great and the mixed drinks were also spot on. Interesting atmosphere with a bunch the taxidermy and dark lighting. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is as close as I get to claiming a local.  It is a great place to meet for a date or for a chance to catch up with a friend.  The service is fast.  The atmosphere is good.  The music is never so loud that you can't carry on a decent conversation.  The prices for drinks are also reasonable.    Every time I have gone, I have managed to get a table which really sells this place in my mind.    I am a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. Super cosy interior, great lay out. Would be awesome to rent out. MAC and CHEESE was on point. Good drinks menu and bourbon selection.   Service was impeccable! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh, Toronto. The prices of cocktails and beer are getting out of hand. The Comrade has an excellent selection of rare and local beers, and a great selection of cocktails, wines and scotches. The selection isn't the problem, but I take some offence to being charged $6-7 for teeny-weeny bottles of Mill Street beer that for the same price elsewhere you would get a whole pint. That said, the Comrade is a cool space, filled with hip east-enders and has a fun soundtrack for a night of high-end drinking."}
{"text":"Jess is amazing on bar! Very accommodating! With flavours and needs in s cocktail  So amazing at her craft"}
{"text":"Wow!! Great service, fantastic atmosphere. Love it! Got to bring my wife for a date night."}
{"text":"The Comrade is my favourite lounge in Leslieville!  Great beer selections with 2 full pages, for sure you can find something you like!  Cocktails from $10 were nicely crafted. My Elderflower Frizz ($10) was well balanced.  Staffs were attentive and not being overbearing.   I love the different seating options. The armchairs we  lounge in feels homey and comfy......   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan. The fellow parents on my street always need a time to get out and act like adults. We landed here and frequented for a while (need to return).  I'm a big fan of the burger. It arrives unassuming, looking true to its low price. First bite is surprising and tasty. I'm a big fan. I've paid twice as much elsewhere with half the taste and will never remember them. Food is great. excellent selection of drinks.  Trappist and burger is great."}
{"text":"I go to bars, and then forget to Yelp about them.  Or remember things like: \"I danced to Salt n Pepa\" or \"tangy limes!\" or \"it's hard to get up on those barstools in heels!\".  Helpful, right?  So, my nights at The Comrade haven't left me with a depth of detail helpful to those scouring the Yelpiverse for Leslieville lounge recs.    BUT...isn't a fuzzy memory a mark of a good night?    (assuming you're head-nodding in the affirmative) I can enthusiastically vouch for The Comrade.    Great decor, creative drink specials, attentive service (minimal wait at the bar even when busy; circulating staff who check in), cool music, chill folk.  One drink turns into multiples and, well...there's another Saturday night down the hatch, gang.  Yelp note: in warm weather the front of The Comrade opens with garage doors.  Sit inside, get some breeze, do some people watching...it's a fail-proof formula, trust."}
{"text":"Great spot! I love the extensive drink menu and their food was great. I ordered the rice bowl, which was spicier than I expected (I have a somewhat low tolerance for spice) but I actually ended up finishing the whole bowl despite that - it was quite good.  The place is a bit dark and the music they play might be a bit too loud for some (but not loud enough that you can't hear the conversations at your table),  but it didn't bother me at all (I actually liked it )  As for the service: no complaints  - they've been pretty friendly, accommodating and helpful (especially during busy nights). Will definitely be back.  Note: if you are planning to go with a group of people, I'd call in advance as they don't seem to have that much space to accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"Comrade: an intimate friend or associate, a fellow soldier.   My fellow soldier, Matt M and I, got very intimate with the food and drinks... and more drinks (...and then they just charged us for the bottle) at Comrade last night. It was a lovely evening and the staff were superb.   For a Tuesday night they were pretty busy, and there was only one server and one bartender. Kudos to the whole staff for being so grand whilst being so slammed.  I had the deviled eggs followed by the tacos and Matt had the hot dogs. Everything was delicious. The menu has a Korean twist to it, which at first seemed out of place, but the flavors were creative. It worked. Koren? Russian? Pub? It's everything in a darkened, drunk package.   The bartender makes a good bourbon sour, and the sauv by the glass is good. They keep it really cold. I like that.   PEPPER POINTS For having Chess for the patrons to play in the back.   PEPPER'S PISSED: There were these film dudes doing script edits at the table next to us. They are making the worst RomCom of all time and think they're fucking Woody Allen. But we had fun mocking them. So maybe I wasn't so pissed... but ugh. You know the type."}
{"text":"We all go to bars, and then forget about them. Or remember things like: \"I hate it when the girls dis me\" . Kidding. So, my nights at The Comrade haven't left me with a depth of detail ...that the Yelp community can use...it's a nice place to hang out...inexpensive and fun."}
{"text":"love this place - a must go for EVERYONE. they have it all, an awesome bartender, a great scotch selection, delicious cocktails and unique canadian beers!"}
