{"text":"I am a really fussy eater (being from India does not help). Having tasted most Middle-eastern food in town, I would say, this is at par (if not better than) Lulu's, at a fraction of the price. I have absolutely fallen in love with this place. I tried something called the Chicken Tan Tan (sp?) - half a chicken nicely marinated and then baked with a side order of rice. It was out of this world. I also tried a couple of salads - both were outstanding. The vegetarian options are also great. Like I said earlier, no other place in Madison (other than Lulu's) comes close to their quality. If you dont mind their decor (or lack thereof), you have to go there !"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for the donuts, which are awesome. But I didn't feel compelled to write a review until coming here for dinner a few days ago - the food is absolutely delicious! It's a shame it's not more obvious from the outside, but the lunch/dinner menu is extensive, the prices are excellent, the people are friendly, and the food is phenomenal. I got a gyro sandwich and it was enormous, delicious, and only $4.50. 

I love Banzo, which is the obvious point of comparison for People's Bakery, but I'd probably choose PB given that the food is just as good an a whole lot cheaper. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The donuts are amazing and super-fattening of course, but then I guess you shouldn't be eating donuts if you are concerned with your weight.

I agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.

Falafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.

Tan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...

Anyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!

P.S. I also liked a bunch of other stuff there, the hummus, side dishes, veggie mezza, etc. Probably can't go wrong with anything there."}
{"text":"Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli. But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab. :]

The donuts are alright too. They have a wide variety! Myself, I really rather like their cookies. They also offer homemade baklava.

Really though I can reccomend their sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries. Quite yummy! Vegetarian options also available such as potato kahbi or falafel sandwiches. And they had a lot of beverages to choose from too.

Although the location is not ideal, it's worth a stop if you're in that part of town. :]"}
{"text":"Great place to go for gyros, falafel, and lots of other delicious Mediterranean / Lebanese food that's worth trying. Also, the food is really cheap - you can get a whole huge bag of great food for under 20 bucks. An older Lebanese couple run this place - they are very nice and do a good job. As far as the bakery items, go with twisty donut things w/ the red strip down the middle or the baklava."}
{"text":"Herein lie the finest falafel sandwiches in the area, and that's all that's needed to justify my continuing patronage.

The donuts fill the display cases with colors, and fill the air with intoxicating scents. So many different shapes and sizes, but the freshness and delicacy are consistent throughout. The \"Rapid Dozen\" is a good value, providing a diverse sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far.

Still, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel. You will find plenty of tasty dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above. There aren't, truth be told, more than a few real competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive with any I've had throughout the country.

The prices and the falafels simply cannot be beat, and the owners are incredibly warm and friendly people who have been crafting joy through delicious food for many moons now. There is nothing to keep me from recommending People's Bakery with the full five stars."}
{"text":"We decided to stop at a local food joint on our road trip back to Minneapolis. It was okay. The place is a bit dirty and falling apart. We ordered two falafel pitas which were just 'okay' as well. The falafel was soft, so don't expect the fried, crispy variety. Everyone raves about the baklava, which we had to try, only to be disappointed. We must've gotten an old batch because is was both dry and soggy. It should have some crisp to it.  Would not stop here again on future road trips."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and reasonably inexpensive! Had to wait a little bit because he made everything fresh. I'll definitely wait for freshly made food!"}
{"text":"Who says donuts and Lebanese food don't go together?!  People's Bakery has made me a believer of this magical combination! This place is great for some affordable, delicious Lebanese food, and some of the best donuts in town. The outside (and inside) is unassuming, but the food is authentic (as far as I know) and yummy. 

Pros
- VERY affordable
- friendly and helpful staff
- Did I mention it is scrumptious?

Cons
- service is a little slow
- inconsistent drink options

I highly recommend trying their falafel with a fritter for dessert."}
{"text":"Yum. Very good chocolate glazed donut. Decent coffee, though nothing fancy and I like it much stronger. Will try their falafel soon."}
{"text":"We will drive from Dudgeon Monroe to the East side for good falafel and gyros. The quality and service at People's Bakery are a great reminder why the (much closer) Biryani doesn't deserve our business. Skip the babaganoush, but make sure to grab a sweet treat for dessert instead!"}
{"text":"Great Donut & drink selection, and the food is cooked right in front of you.

The place is a little out of the way, the only thing that youll see is a neon 'Gyros' sign in the window, but its worth stopping by. The people are very friendly, and the value is the best for the immediate area( and this is from a UW student who frequents the nearby TacoBell trying to slim budget...).
The only thing I can think of against the place are the hours- I really wish they stayed open longer! I cant count how many times ive been returning from groceries or whaterver and passed by the place, closed, and realized my dinner options were slim to none. One can hope for the futre though, and if youre ever around stop in, the donuts(hard to come by since I moved to Madison- just imagining maybe) alone are worth a trip."}
{"text":"Another mixed bag review!

Let's start with the great: the donuts.  The one I tried was as good as Greenbush, and $.25 cheaper.  ;)  And I think bigger.  So, pretty much awesome.

Also, the fries.  Very crunchy and yummy.  Good.  This place clearly knows how to fry things.

It would've been a 5-star review if I'd stuck only to fried items.  But, I also had a falafel sandwich, which was disappointing.  The wrap was extremely bland, the veggies were sad (anemic tomatoes and iceberg lettuce), and there was a bit too much tahini/yogurt for my taste.  The falafel themselves were fine but kind of ruined by the rest of the wrap's components. 

I'd definitely go again for breakfast/donuts, but probably won't be back for lunch."}
{"text":"great donuts. great gyros.
and the most adorable owners ever.
just make sure you aren't in any rush, if you think about ordering food here. still worth visiting."}
{"text":"Some secrets are best kept secret.  However I don't want my new donuts find going out of business anytime soon.  I stumbled across this little gem while trying to find some real donuts for my wife to take to her at work.  I found the People's Bakery.  The donuts selection was wonderful.  The wall mentioned some other baked goods as you walk in like scones, but those are no longer available.  The donuts were fantastic.  So good that I had to go back today and they are still fantastic and the shelves were socked full at 9:30am with plenty of choices and the prices are great.  
To be honest i had tunnel vision on the donuts but I believe they have some other things to offer for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"After moving from Chicago to Madison, I thought that I would be safely tucking my Lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue, saving it only for the occasional trips back to Kedzie Avenue.  That was, until my wife and I discovered People's bakery.  

Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  

We ordered a lunch \"to-go.\"  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  

Nonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?  They looked stunningly good, but we both left that for another day.  Lebanese food and donuts....a winning combination, in my book."}
{"text":"I like the food and donuts, but and more importantly, I really like the people who run this place and the people who hang out there."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and all they had were donuts and cold coffee. The service was awful and borderline rude. I will not go again and would not recommend it to anyone

Visits: 1"}
{"text":"Great donuts topped off a tasty meal. A little hard to find but like Arnold I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there today with my fiance.  We had the hummus and lamb and the felafel.  The lamb was amazing.  Little pieces cut up and placed on a bed of hummus.  The hummus was very smooth and great texture.  The hummus was good, but Bunky's is still my favorite in town. 

The felafel was good, not too heavy.  Serve in pita bread with a sauce and veggies.  They have a good selection of beverages, they had my favorite Nantucket Nectar and some good bottled lemonade.

After our main course we decided to try some pastries.  The baklava was amazing.  It was light and flavorful.  We also had a french glazed doughnut which was better then Greenbush.  

The lady that works the counter is very friendly.  When we went back to purchase the pastries we only had credit cards, and they have a $5 minimum.  She let us just add it to the tip of our original bill!"}
{"text":"This place is so accidental hipster, and defies categorization. Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room? Let's just say if a donut shop and a small restaurant played Tetris, this would be the result. 

The eating area is quiet - no music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee. The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. 

There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. 

The service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food. My five-star ratings often depend on how likely and how often I would return, and this place definitely makes the twice-a-month cut."}
{"text":"I've never gotten why the People's Bakery isn't packed, but at the same time, I've always appreciated not being crowded by college kids.  The owners are WONDERFUL and I can really only explain the charm of this place by saying that it is the only place I know of where I can get home made french cruller AND swarma AND turkish coffee.  (Free Wi-fi)."}
{"text":"Want donuts in Madison?  This is where you ought to be.  The people's bakery is a small donut shop on Madison's east side and the place represents this town perfectly.  They also serve food like Gyros, which are delicious, but probably not Madison best gyro.  

A husband and wife team run this place and they do an outstanding job.  Super nice too.  If you want an outstanding box of donuts, like top-notch stuff, this place is worth your time.  And if you want to buy local and support an outstanding company than THIS IS IT!"}
{"text":"Excelent food.  Many times I've ordered something on the menu that was described in a way that painted a more plain, bland and uneventful picture, and have always been plesantly surprised !  After this happened once, I dont assume that shicken pita sandwich means only that !   Delicious fresh food.  Great prices, homemade.
Like many non upscale, true small ethnic restaurants, it is sparcely decorated.   In a world where restaurants hire interior designers, it can take some getting used to eating in a restaurant where the focus really is on the food.  Oh, yea fortions are really good too !
and the only focus is really on the food."}
{"text":"Am I at he same place that got 4 stars? This place is a dirty dump. Everything. I use the bathroom and there were no paper towels. I ordered Turkish coffee. What could go wrong. Lord help me...."}
{"text":"Best Gyros, hands down.  And reasonably priced too.  Good chicken sandwiches.  And their mediteranian entrees are delicious as well.  As for the donuts, they are above average but not amazing.  The owners are so kind.  I like going here."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Made fresh and done with care. I have enjoyed delicious baked goods and pastries as well as lunch and dinner food at People's Bakery. You should give it a try"}
{"text":"Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  

Start with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.

This was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    

Quick review:
- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint

- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.

- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.

- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  

Sarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful

All in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj."}
{"text":"I feel so-so about this place.  We've been a few times, and their Gyros are 'ok'.  That's it - nothing like what I used to get back in the day at Parthenon's (I no longer consider them good).  We went in last week after probably what's been a year, and I just wasn't impressed.  I feel like they went from okay to 'eh' and we decided to stay and eat, and the place is just in need of a little TLC...it seemed really dirty, which I'm not a fan of when I'm eating, it makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like.  The lettuce was definitely on its last leg, very brown...so I don't think I'll be planning a trip back anytime soon.  From other reviews I'm reading, it sounds like I should go back for bakery items if I ever do!"}
{"text":"Divey hole in the wall kind of place.  But cherry fritter will amaze!!  Coffee below average.  Donuts reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fresh donuts everyday at reasonable prices.  They have a large variety of donuts including fritters, cream filled, and old fashioned blueberry donuts.  I get them for my coworkers often.

They carry other food as well and baked goods, and offer a selection of refrigerated beverages.

Had to teach a gentleman there how to use there credit card machine once to pay for my donuts..."}
{"text":"Great Greek food. Delicious and huge assortment of donuts! Worth stopping in for a treat."}
{"text":"Updated review,
I have to give them more stars. For one they have pretty tasty food once I tried more dishes.  The cucumber sauce on the side also really good.  It has also become my stop for mousaka! Mmmm"}
{"text":"Yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open until 8 pm. So I was confused and disappointed that they were closed when I pulled up shortly after 7:30 pm. Lights were out, nobody home. Hmmmm... 
Hopefully I can update my rating in the future :(

Update:
I am now a huge fan! Service is fast and prices are great. The blueberry fritter is heavenly. On the weekends I anxiously wait for 7 am to roll around so I can head over for my fix."}
{"text":"Their food and pastries are good, but most importantly they had the best baklava I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best baklava I have ever had!!!! soooo happy. Would have posted a picture but I ate it too fast."}
{"text":"The food and service attitude is pretty good for the price you pay.
They also got all kinds of beverages to go with your meal. They cook it fresh after you place an order. The owners are very nice.

We had the vegetarian meza. Everything tastes good, though I've definitely had better middle eastern food before. But for the price you pay, the food is well worth it. All the basics are done right, e.g. dolma, hummus, kabob/shawarma, cucumber yogurt, kofta, kebbi, etc.

But I will mention stuff they could improve a bit more:
The red pepper paste was a bit bitter, but taste fresh
Tabouli was a bit saucy (ask them to use less dressing)."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts, very good falafel. I had a potato dish that seemed a little on the old side. They shouldn't have served it if it was past due. Gyros is good quality. My advice is come here and order high-turnover foods. Very nice people and the food is well-priced, definitely worth supporting over all of the awful chains that line this stretch of East Washington."}
{"text":"Not my favorite bakery in town but they do a really good job with their doughnuts! Try the persians and other doughnuts. Anything fried they really kick ass on (falafel, doughnuts, the cookies (not fried) are great too). I have sampled and will stay away from their fresh ingredient items in the future (wraps, sandwiches, etc)

Service is always fast, friendly (to the extent of the language barrier that exists within you), and the prices are super competitive!"}
{"text":"So good!!! We went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered.  The food was very reasonably priced!! Yum!"}
{"text":"As everyone in Madison knows, there are no doughnut chain stores around.  No Krispy Kreme.  No Dunkin Donuts.  Although I know that the best doughnuts in town are from the Greenbush Bakery, sometimes it's just easier to go with the place down the street.  

That basically sums up the People's Bakery.  When you're too lazy to go anywhere else, they are pretty good."}
{"text":"I am pretty disappointed with this place.  After it being described as the best gyro in town, I was let down. The gyro is good and it is only $4.50. However, best in town? Eh. 

They forgot my tomatoes. There is nothing really terrible about this place, but it was just \"ok.\""}
{"text":"I love this place. 

Excellent donuts, you must try one even if you go in for \"regular\" food. My favorite are the blueberry. 

Super yummy gyros piled high with meat. Kickass falafel. I've also had the steak and rice and thought it was great. 

Nice owners, sometimes the service is a little slow, but they are a small business with usually only the owner and maybe his wife working. Take a book or magazine along, it may take a few minutes to get your order."}
{"text":"I haven't had any of the falafel or gyros here.........yet.  I have had the opportunity to fatten myself up that much more by eating some of their delicious doughnuts.  They are really cheap AND really good.  

The owners are a friendly, older couple who look like they are workin' hard.  I asked if they would be my new parents, and they just laughed, but I was serious.  Will you be my new mom and dad?  Or how about my new granny and papa?  I won't ask for money..............just doughnuts!

I'm toilet trained........

*knocking on glass window*

Please???"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't more popular.  You know how hard it can be to get good Lebanese food in Madison?  (Gas station gyros don't count.)

So for starters, this place has all the traits of a best kept secret - very small space, cluttered waiting area and counter, and a sweet older lady (co-owner) who is doing it all from start to finish.

Given the above, it's not going to be a 3 minute ramen soup stop.  Be prepared to wait based on my experience.  The wait will only heighten your anticipation of the awesomeness that you'll soon enjoy. 

Tried to hold back, but just wanted to try it all!  Ordered a variety including hummus, moohamara (red pepper/walnut spread), babaganoush, falafel, and Gyro plate.  All very, very good.

Best Lebanese I've ever had was in New York; People's Bakery is competitive with my memory! 

I'd been meaning to try PB for years (yes) but they're usually closed when I think of it.  That said, early close times (6/7pm).

People's Bakery should be on your Madison gustatory bucket list.  With aging owners and a craft not easily picked up by others, hard to say how much longer we'll have this secret to keep."}
{"text":"My first and quite frankly last visit to this joint.

Decor : Vague and rather creepy at times with very strange paintings adorning the walls. To each his own I guess but off-putting in general for me. 

Service : Average. The old folks seem sweet but barely spoke or showed any elation when we greeted them. Not sure what to make of it but clearly looks like a place that's not used to a lot of crowd. The lady though did appear to be the friendlier of the two.

Food : I went here with a craving of some delicious lamb and gyro love!  Alas, it was a cold hearted meal :(. We ordered 2 portions of their Lamb Platter. Despite being the ONLY customers in the joint, it took around 20 mins to come. The platter had an average rice preparation, with a side of grilled onion and last but DEFINITELY the least, the Lamb. The portion was terrible and the pieces looked extremely unappetizing. They were hard and chewy and in no way fresh. The only decent thing about that plate was a tiny portion of their yogurt dip. Sadly, had to leave the plate half done as it wasn't palatable at all.

Value : For $10 a plate and that kind of food, sorry, but value is non existent here. Please try other joints.

P.S. I didn't  get to try any other items on their menu so can't speak for them."}
{"text":"Best falafel in the midwest, and I've tried dozens."}
{"text":"A great couple who serve great middle eastern ethnic cuisine. I just bought a bunch of baklavas for my office potluck for a great price. 
Even though the decor and all is pretty modest, a true food lover will love this place"}
{"text":"At work, while trying to decide where to order dinner, a co-worker suggested People's Bakery.  I had the Lamb Kabobs, and they were so yummy!  The meat could have been trimmed a little better, but they were so well seasoned.  It came with lots of yellow rice, and some green pepper and onions.  It was very fast and not too expensive (around $13).  I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"In addition to sweet treats like donuts and bear claws, they also have lunch and dinner options for cheap. Falafel is not the best in town, but try the gyro, which comes as a sandwich or entree sized plate. They have other standard Mediterranean options such as hummus and kebobs. Seating is limited and would not be good for large groups. Definitely more of a take-out place. I would definitely go back to explore their menu."}
{"text":"They are the best. Great flavor, it can not get more mom and pop, the owners are great the only issue I see us that it  is hard to stop eating them"}
{"text":"So when you walk in, expectations might dip by the decor, dirty floor and less than warm welcome. Ordering is pretty standard for a fast food restaurant, however the woman working the counter is quite brash and it makes things awkward pretty quickly. I ordered the spinach with rice dish, and my husband got the gyro. We also ordered hummus as an appetizer. The app never came out and then she called out our food and we had to pick it up. The spinach dish was most likely the most unappetizing plate I have eaten, ever. The braised spinach was so old it had turned completely brown, and the rice was clumpy and lacked any flavor. I couldn't even stomach a few bites. The gyro was a gyro, nothing great, nothing terrible. When we went to pay she remembered the hummus and tried to push us to get it, but we were not wanting anything else from the establishment."}
{"text":"You don't want to come here if you are looking for a fantastic dining atmosphere, but you can't beat it for great take-out.  The falafel is amazing!  Their hummus doesn't come close to competing with Banzo, but the prices are quite a bit cheaper.  You can walk out with two falafel pita sandwiches for under ten dollars."}
{"text":"OK Mediterranean food.  Not the best, but not the worst.  My falafel sandwich was decent.  The cucumber sauce had a nice, refreshing flavor.  The falafels themselves were very herb-y but didn't have a whole lot of crunch.  Some people don't care, but I like mine crunchy.  My husband wasn't too happy with his gyro--meat a little tough and the flavors were a little bland.

The doughnut we had, though, was very good.  We had a chocolate cake doughnut.  Very good chocolate flavor and delicious cake.  The doughnut and pastry selection is impressive, as is the drink selection (although everything is in bottles and cans--didn't see any fountain drinks, but they do make coffee drinks, too).

Nice, small, family-run restaurant.  The owners were very nice to us, especially my son, who was running around all over the place.  Although there's a lot better Mediterranean in Madison, this might be the best one on the East Side that is open during dinner time.  This might be the best doughnut place on this side of town, though, so if you're on the East Side and are having a doughnut hankering, check out People's Bakery."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food and friendly owners. They also make delicious kosher doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts! I thought the vanilla frosted long john was on par with Greenbush's similar donuts. This should be your donut stop on the East Side. They also serve hot middle eastern food, which I plan to come back to try. 

Just make sure you have some time, even if you're just picking up donuts to go. There was just one person working the counter and cooking customers' meals so the whole process took awhile."}
{"text":"Well. It says 4 stars. Decor says 0 stars. It looks like an incredibly dirty hole in the wall. We walked into the restaurant, and we almost left immediately.  We got the 2 person veggie sampler. It was okay. I said 3.5/5 the man friend said 3/5. But looking at the place the food was made brought the overall to 2/5.  Will not order again even though the food is okay."}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine Lebanese cuisine, baked goods, gyros, funky interior design and second hand talk of bed bugs?  

The perfect #yelpnewvember storm, that's what.

Over the summer, there was a spirited debate about where to find the best gyros in town after the unfortunate demise of Dmitri's.  After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.

If you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. 

I ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  

On the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:
* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.
* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.
* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.

Now the positives:
* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.
* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.
* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.

So, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering."}
{"text":"Best old fashioned donuts in Madison. I don't live anywhere near here, but I'm lucky my coworker does. I get ridiculously excited when she brings them in. My usual stop in Madison to cure a donut craving is Scott's in Middleton because it's convenient and decent (I think their best donut is their raised maple frosted or the decadent german chocolate), but oh how I wish I drove past People's on the way to work instead. Just the right texture and sweetness."}
{"text":"Stopped here a few times for the yummy baklava. I've eaten lunch here once and it was fabulous. I had the tan-tan chicken and it was amazing! Moist chicken and lovely flavors."}
{"text":"We just tried People's Bakery tonight and loved it. The food is both delicious and reasonably priced. The owner noticed us trying to figure out what to order for our young daughter, and she took the time to talk to our daughter about what she likes and dislikes, and made a special sandwich just for her. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been lamenting the lack of Mediterranean establishments on the Eastside for a while. We have arguably the best Thai, Indian, Nepali, Jamaican, Japanese, Chinese and American restaurants in town. But Downtown and the Westside both hold the Mediterranean trump card.

Then I discovered People's Bakery. How can you go wrong? Fresh pastry AND gyros? Wait. Did I say gyros? Yes, I did. No longer do you have to venture downtown to get said sandwich. And the one I had wasn't a ticking grease bomb!

Do yourself a favor when you go and try the red lentil soup. The flavor is excellent and there's plenty of cumin to spare. Delicious! My gyro and bowl of soup plus coffee was under $10, so it's a great choice when you're low on cash and need a filling lunch.

(Oh, and it's right next to El Pescador, across from the Madison East Shopping Center. Pretty easy to miss when driving.)"}
{"text":"A falafel sandwich and a can of iced mocha for 5 bucks? Yasss. This place is still awesome; still going strong. Long live People's Bakery."}
{"text":"Yummy delicious perfect gyros. They're meaty and spiced wonderfully. The sauce is not too tangy and there are veggies in there as well. $4-something each.  Inside of the store smells delicious and owners are sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. I primarily came here because I had a taste for some kibbeh. I've been in some dives that have had amazing food; this place is not one of them. I ordered kibbeh, yanlangi (Sarma/stuffed grape leaves), and baba ganoush. Beginning with the kibbeh; it was on the bland side and the texture was off. It was as though they had fried the earlier that day or week, placed it in the refrigerator for several hours/days, then microwaved them. There was no crispieness to them, in fact they were slightly soggy and lukewarm at best. As for the grape leaves, let me begin by saying that these have only ever been served to me room temperature or just below, they were very cold like there were sitting in the coldest part of the refrigerator. As a result of the low temperature, the flavors of the yanlangi were lost. It wasn't until they warmed up slightly that the grape leaves started to taste normal. Finally, the only complaint I have about the baba ganoush is that they gave me only a half a pita that was very thin (more of a Turkish style).

I don't normally complain about the appearance of a restaurant because the food is usually good, well that's not the case here. The place was cluttered; the layout is not the best thereby furthering the cluttered feeling. The place was also dirty; I don't know what I leaned on or touched but I went in the restaurant with clean short and left with a black soot like substance on the front of my leg. Finally, the customer service was awful; I wasn't greeted by anyone and it felt like my walking in the building was a burden to them. The only words spoken to me was the price of my food. The entire experience was off putting. To their credit, taxes are built into the price which is nice to see. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Since moving to the east side I have started to go here almost every Saturday morning to pick up a couple of donuts and a coffee. I had absolutely no idea that it existed until a cabbie friend of mine told me it was one of his favorite places to stop between fares.

(Can I just say that cabbies are amazing? They know where everything is, and they know about all the cool hidden spots that most of us pass up every day. If you know a cabbie, pick their brain sometime. You will probably discover at least one awesome place because of them.)

So, back to People's. The donuts are really top notch. Chewy, moist, iced just enough, and they have a ton of options. I really think that their plain glazed and their boston cream donuts are the best. Their glazed donuts have this bit of crispiness to them that is amazing. The fritters aren't as good as Greenbush, but still tasty. There are also some specialty desserts that I am unsure of, but will have to try some day. 

As far as the food goes - the gyros are among the best I have had in town (right up there with Gyro House) but that is all I have tried there so far.

So, to sum it all up: good gyros, great donuts, fair prices, and great (but sort of slow) service. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Donuts as BIG as your head!  Fresh Lebanese food made to order made by the friendly owner!  Such was my experience today at People's Bakery.  I don't really understand why the place was so empty today but it was fine with me.  I ordered tabbouleh, baba ghanoush, hummus, pita and a giant donut!   You'd never think we would have authentic Lebanese in a generic looking mini mall in Wisconsin but we do-I feel lucky it's just a few blocks away from my house. 

Downside = Styrofoam containers...I might attempt to bring my own next time to avoid them!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's just be honest here. The \"decor\" leaves much to be desired. But really, this is not why I stop at People's Bakery. It's those damn doughnuts (the French crullers to be specific). These guys make the most amazing doughnuts, the French cruller as you've now learned are my favorite. I can easily inhale 3 or 4 of these buggers at a time. They are perfectly light and airy, and the glaze hugs the outside so perfectly, they just melt in your mouth. God I love 'em. I've also had the kibbe, which I think is wonderful. My son will accompany me on a trip to People's Bakery if I promise to buy him a couple doughnuts. The two of us sit in the scanty boothed table as he unenthusiastically watches me savor every last tidbit of the kibbe dipped in the yogurt sauce. Mmmmm... considering how labor intensive it is to make kibbe at home, these are a god-send. I'm admittedly no connoisseur when it comes to Lebanese foods, but their kibbe wins my vote for quick and tasty. On a side note: my son who is a teenager, still remembers when he was 2 yrs old, how the owner was so nice to him and greeted him every time we entered the store. It may not be a palace, but the food and pride in ownership makes a mark on one's memory and taste buds."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are good (and pretty cheap!), but I really love this place for a quick, cheap lunch.  They make their falafel and gyros fresh, so be prepared to wait a few minutes for them to put 'em together.  There's a small dining area, or you can take your food to go.  The owners are friendly and efficient.

The only thing I really wish this place would do is make fresh bread and rolls, but it's strictly doughnuts and sweet pastries here."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, before People's Bakery, I never really liked baklava. It was either too dry or too rose water-y for my liking. But then, I found People's Bakery and I am now obsessed with baklava. We went three days in a row over Labor Day weekend to get multiple baklavas. 

I'm also a giant fan of their donuts and fritters. Such a great price for a donut! I wish I lived on the east side just so I can come here to get donuts.

We ordered a falafel wrap one of the days we were there. The fries are my favorite - extra crispy. The falafel was pretty good. I liked that it wasn't dry. I'd definitely come back to try other wraps."}
{"text":"Living 1 block away is dangerous! This is a hidden treasure for sure. The owners are a sweet older couple who knock out some amazing food. Can't speak for the donuts but I promise you will enjoy the food. The falafel with fries is a bargain--5 bucks or so--and it will be made totally fresh for you. My go to I don't feel like cooking spot."}
{"text":"wasn't sure what to expect, but the food was EXCELLENT.  personal service from the husband & wife owners make you feel right at home.  the tabouleh and hommos definitely rival anyplace i've ever tried.  they actually make the tabouleh to order!!!  incredibly fresh and delicious.  delicious baklava!  and, although i didn't try any, the donuts also looked amazing.  might have to stop back and pick up a dozen, for the road."}
{"text":"Went for dinner the other night. We have found our new gyro restaurant!
Hubby & I both ordered gyro. One sammy, one plate. Man, was it good!
Took a raspberry fritter home for dessert, and that was great as well.
We will definitely be back!"}
