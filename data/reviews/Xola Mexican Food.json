{"text":"So lovely! Food was wonderful- complex, fresh, and very authentic. Our server was kind and helpful. A little low on vegetarian options, and the place is quite small, but not poorly laid out, just cozy. Plus, there's old black and white El Santo movies playing (without sound) near the register! A fantastic option in a neighbourhood mostly bereft of wallet-and-palate friendly food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have had a few dinners here and loved everyone of them. I wrote a review already but don't see it so I will repeat myself. I brought my friend from Mexico with me who said she loved it. She loved how it gave her a taste of home while offering something a little different. I can't tell you how good it is but I can tell you to get the Pineapple and Cactus leaf guac because it is the best.  One review gave a 1/5 because they would not do take out at 8 pm on a Saturday. This is a small family and the only person cooking is the mom. She learned to cook with her Grandmother in mexico from a very young age and is the one who makes the place so incredible..basically alone in the kitchen, because her husband is the server. I know all this because I talked to them so before you give a bad review for such a small reason try actually talking to them or trying their food to discover that they were in fact very busy with people sitting down. They do take out all other days and generally Saturdays when not as busy so that's too bad that you went on a busy night but not their fault."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very authentic taste along with a great presentation. Homemade guacamole."}
{"text":"The fish tacos and margaritas were outstanding. Atmosphere is cozy and warm. Also tried something with duck that tasted heavenly. What a charming place."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican gem in the Beach! Dined here during a snow storm and it could not have been more cozy. Fish Tacos and burrito were delicious. They also have some intresting tequila offerings that I spotted on my way out, that I will try next time!"}
{"text":"Hibiscus Margarita was amazing!    Guacamole was fresh with great homemade chips!  Fish tacos were hot and delicious!  Wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Toronto.  You won't find the normal tacos etc on this menu.  Great quality meats, extraordinary sauces, fantastic margaritas.  Must try the guacamole sampler which gives you three different guacamoles - all tremendously tasty  Very small and cozy so you may not always get a table.  Finding a place of this quality in The Beach is unusual and a real find.  Topper is the authentic Mexican movies playing in the corner.  Usually one of the classic wrestling ones  with the masked combatants!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very intimate - seats less than 20 people. Don't bother getting the fish tacos - they basic and boring. However, do bother getting any other taco. They're delicious. I had the beef adobo tacos which were very goods Loved the cucumber margarita, and gorditas. Next time will get the chicken wings, and guacamole sampler."}
{"text":"Sort by:  DateFilter by:  Location    Category 2222a queen st east Toronto, ON M4E 1H2 Zola   Neighbourhood: The Beach   9/12/2013  First to Review I must start by saying this is the first time I have posted an online review.  I feel people should be warned to stay away from this place and save themselves the physical torment  that follows after ingesting the food.  New restaurant just opened a few weeks ago, however I have been told it is the same people who were running the Embrujo Flamenco kitchen  which closed this summer ( heard it re-opened with new owners)  First impression upon walking in......turn around and leave!  The place is very small, dingy and dirty.  Tables are not wiped and chairs are dirty...had to use a wetnap to clean my table and chair before I could sit.  Having had traditional Mexican food on many occasions I was very disappointed with this restaurant's offerings. Whoever came up with this menu needs to have a solid re-think.  The gorditas were horrible, the guacamole tasted like it had been frozen and the chips were stale.  The portions are very small (likely a blessing in disguise considering the poor quality).  The service is horrible and someone should tell the woman in the kitchen (appears to be the chef and owner by what she was saying) that while she is not in a predominently Spanish speaking country there are many, like me who are fluent in Spanish , so all the yelling that was going on was undertood by me 100%.  Disappointing to say the least.  I will never go back.  Gave it one star as it is required to make a post, otherwise would have been a o"}
{"text":"What a great spot!  Only about 7 tables so be prepared to wait a little but I think it's worth it.  At first I thought the portions were small but I could hardly move at the end of the meal I was so full.  We tried the guacamole sampler, which was ridiculously good.   The fish tacos weren't like any I've had before and had a nice kick to them.  Great little place in the Beach."}
{"text":"First impressions...I don't know because they wouldn't do a take-out order at 8pm on a Saturday night. They said they were short-staffed and thus not doing take-out orders, despite several promotional articles suggesting take-out over seating due to lack of space. So we'll see. I would say better luck next time but this left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Don't expect regular tex mex here. Multiple flavours, homemade tortillas and fresh lime margaritas. Yay, finally Mexican food in the beaches and great to boot!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican. On par with the best in the city. A stand-out restaurant on the Queen East strip in the Beach."}
{"text":"This little gem might be a little too real and down to earth for an area whose banal cuisine accurately reflects the blandness of the people who live there. So go while you still can, and don't let the tiny floor or limited seating throw you--it's part of the charm. Fish tacos on weekend brunch are especially wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food and vibe. The staff and owners are really friendly and were great with my 4 year old and 1 year old. I've had the fish tacos twice and they're awesome. My wife had the special taco... Think it was shrimp. Overall a great restaurant. So happy to have a great spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Mexican food is probably my favourite of ALL the foods.. and this place does not disappoint. I love that they have different variations of guac and chips. I got the blue cheese and walnut one- yum! Sangria is top notch, I felt like I was in Spain while I sipped on it. It's also muy fuerte, which is a good thing, I think. This place is awesome, BUT a little on the pricey side as far as Mexican goes.. The owners seem really nice, they let me practice my Spanish with them.. Que bien!!"}
{"text":"Xola is the rare restaurant that simply fills you with the joy of eating wonderfully crafted food, served by lovely people, in a cozy and welcoming space. I've been half a dozen times and it just seems to get better and better."}
{"text":"Awesome little place! The fish tacos and appetizers are outstanding! The service is excellent too."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had a traditional margarita that hit the spot. We loved the guacamole as a starter. Both of our meals left us full. A steak with salsas and a chicken taco dish. The owner was gracious in helping us with our menu decisions. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Note: I ordered delivery from Doordash  Food arrived fast and hot, but I ordered the tacos and since they pack everything separate, they forgot my tortillas. I was told that it would be about a 45-min wait to get them and declined.   Food tasted good, but the delivery portions were small. Price are also ridiculous for what you get.  Overall, this is a better restaurant to dine-in. Avoid the takeout unless you want to eat tortilla-less tacos!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's expensive but the food is absolutely delicious and they don't scrimp ok portions!! Everything is made fresh onsite, and you can either eat in or take out. The dining area is small but comfortable, and the owners are very nice and fun! The husband had a lovely chat with my teenaged daughter about Robert Rodriguez films. :) All the food I've tasted has been delicious and the wife makes some excellent recommendations! Also GET THE SANGRIA! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Update: went back after reopening.  Don't bother getting the fish tacos the fish is deep fried and not flavourful (the rest of the toppings were flavourful). Get anything else bc everything is jam packed with flavour.  There is no AC.  doesn't bother me but might bother some."}
{"text":"Excelente!!!!! I had a great experience at Xola, great service and great food. 100% authentic Mexican food and test. We ordered appetizer Trio, the Duck confit tacos and the Arrechera everything was awesome!!! I definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This place can barely hold 20 people, so you better get there fast, before the line-ups get too long or they have to move to a bigger location. Mexico has a great and living cuisine that comes almost entirely from Indigenous traditions that have given the world cacao (chocolate) and corn, and many other gifts. Xola offers this authentic cuisine to Toronto. It has old stand-bys, done properly, such as the daily making of fresh tortillas, which allow Mexican food to be eaten with fingers -- and thus no tool to separate food and the body, and thereby affect the mental space of the eating experience The nutrition is outstanding. Indeed, a recent article on the many nutritional benefits of black beans just won a major science prize.  The mix of complementary protein with a bare minimum of meat is a specialty diet-wise, of Mexican food -- something the world needs to learn as we reduce the amount of meat we eat.  There's innovation here too. You'll love the guacamole with walnuts, blue cheese and onions -- a new dip for the world. Hope it doesn't get snapped up by a global corporation. And it's glocal. The chef gets local corn, local humanely raised pork and beef. They don't do Mexican cheese because they can't get it made locally--Is there a cheesemaker in Ontario listening? In my e-book Food for City Building, I argue that restaurants are partly educational centres, teaching kids to love veggies when properly prepared and teaching everyone about food literacy and culture and multiculturalism. They're not just about filling your face. Xola meets that emerging standard for restaurants, and deserves to do well."}
{"text":"We went there looking forward to having a nice meal. The basic guacamole was pretty tasteless but the chips were good. It had absolutely no seasoning and that meant no garlic no onions no lemons, nothing, just a mashed up avocado. I asked for salsa to go with the guacamole and the chips and they brought me what tasted like a small cup of tomato soup. The regular margarita was very tasty. However when it came to the main course I ordered beef tacos that were dry beyond belief, sort of like a mouth full of sawdust. My dish was in edible. My friend ordered something supposedly stuffed with chicken but it was so dry she couldn't eat it either. So compared to other Mexican restaurants I wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"Came here upon invitation of my friend for his birthday dinner.  Because the restaurant was tiny, we shut the place down for the night with 20-something people in our party.  Happy to be there as the service was very good, the servers keeping up with the big crowd and I was in good company for the whole meal.  I haven't even started with how the food tasted good and this comes from someone who is not such a big fan of tacos.  I definitely enjoyed the warm nachos, tasty and fresh guacamole samplers and absolutely yummy stuffed poblano pepper tacos.  Definitely a good find!"}
{"text":"Our hungry selves found Xolas after a walk along the beach. The overall vibe was inviting and cheerful. We only had to wait a few mins to get the table by the window. There's something about this place that catches your eye because as we ate many people stopped to check the menu and I felt like telling them to just come in! The fish tacos was completely satisfying! My friend had the fried chicken platter, which was surprisingly light and fresh for a fried dish.  It was simply a good eating experience. I highly recommend it. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Best Mex on the beach. Some of the best food I ever ate period I want to eat here every night. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Good authentic mexican food but pricey.  Portions are small. Good service. Try the margarita"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. I'm not sure how it wound up in the Beach where mediocrity is celebrated (ahem, Green Eggplant and ViVetha, where the big draw in both cases seems to be \"they have big portions\"), but all I can say is I'm thrilled they're here and sincerely hope they succeed without having to move to a neighbourhood more worthy of their offerings. What a breath of fresh air. The fish tacos are to die for, the Margarita perfect, the decor charming, the service just right."}
{"text":"A small little restaurant with truly authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Wow! We started with chicken wings marinaded in a blackberry, hibiscus and chipotle sauce along with a blue cheese walnut guacamole - AMAZING!!!!! Our group had Chiles En Nogada and Tacos de Napalcon. In two word - Authentic & Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and margaritas.  I agree, it may seem a little pricey for Mexican but the quality is remarkable and they have tamales at brunch!  While they have wonderful and very filling guacamoles, I'd put my money toward sharing a few taco dishes and margaritas to really experience the nuances of their dishes."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight, and it was a good experience. This place is small, with only 18 seats, and they do take reservations, and by the time we left, every seat was full. We ordered a traditional margarita, and a hibiscus margarita. Both were very good. We shared the chicken wings (done with some Mexican pepper, hibiscus, blackberries and more), and the appetizer trio (a taco, mole, and deep-fried banana). Both dishes were fresh, and totally authentic Mexican. The owners clearly have a passion for their native food, and for the business. We would highly recommend a visit here. It was a lovely experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by Xola during the Family Day long weekend and got their churros. They were ok but I was determined to give the place a fair chance to impress. Wow!!! Did it ever impress me!   So here's the scoop: the place is as tiny as it gets, but comfortable. Depending on the time and day that you're stopping by it's very likely that you'll end up having to wait.   The servers were all really nice and attentive. When my order took ages to arrive, (for God knows what reason as the place was still quiet when I arrived),  the server brought a side order of homemade tortilla chips with guacamole and apologized for the delay. A simple but really nice gesture.   The tortilla and guacamole were outstanding! And the taquito de calamare that I ordered was probably the best I ever had. It had the perfect balance of ingredients and flavours, leaving an incredible after taste in the mouth.   The portions aren't big and it's a little on the pricey side compared to other food options on the Beach. With that said, I don't think I've encountered another place in the neighbourhood where the quality of the plate was so good! The quality of the food more than justifies the price.   First real experience : as awesome as it gets! I know I'll become a regular, especially with Ed's Real Scoop next door and Chocolate across the street providing amazing dessert options."}
{"text":"Xola is definitely one of the better authentic Mexican restaurants around the beaches area (if not the only)  This is the second time we came here. It's a small mom & pop restaurant and has great service and food.   Ok so first off, this place is not your cheapest Mexican place, but you get what you pay for. But once you stack up the prices against other Mexican places like la carnita and Wilbur, it's actually pretty reasonable.   Came here twice, once with just 2 people, and another time with 4.  First time we just ordered bunch of apps, wings are awesome and the Baja taco was ok.   The better experience was when we came with 4 pple. We ordered 3 apps (wings, app trio, and guac) to share and each person ordered a main for themselves.   The apps were delicious. Guac was $11 and is around that price no matter where u go..   App trio was okay I would say..would have liked 1 more tacquitto in there.   The mains were great. The 4 of us all ordered different things, they brought them out alongside with a container of fresh tortillas. They were even kind enough to bring out more tortillas when we were finished. We were stuffed when done. Bill including tax and tip came to about $35 a person. Pretty good if you ask me.  Overall service was great.   Would definitely come back especially when you get the Mexican craving and don't want to travel too far!"}
{"text":"we stopped by this place by chance, it is tiny joint with a Mexican twist. there are about 7 tables. the owner was friendly and offered recommendations accordingly. I cannot remember the name but here it goes: so we had a the fried tacos: Chicken wrapped in fried tacos made an interesting crunchy twist. this was served with one hot sauce and refried beans. the tacos were topped with some shredded letuce and cheese. I found it pretty dry: dry chicken inside, fried tacos, not a juicy mix. We also took the braised beef. I was expecting some kind of Mexican style beef, but I found it very close to some boeuf bourguignon without the veggies.This stew with about 10 soft tacos wrap along with a jalapenos mayo dip and another red tomatillo hot sauce. Good but lacking taste as the beef was in fact not moist at all in my opinion. For starter we had the guacamole and chips, which I think lacked the zestiness of lemon.  Due the high price of the items - such as about $18 per tacos dish, and the average taste, this was a just ok place. I would probably only go if I am craving Mexican but cannot go to a another tastier place."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive. There are no options for children. They suggested an $18 entrée of tostadas as a kids meal. Was 5 thin fingers with a tablespoon of chicken in each and nothing else and three small metal dishes of sauce. Came with nothing except sprinkled lettuce. When they first came with it I thought it was some complimentary dish from the kitchen because it was so tiny. We had some wet wings to go with it. Service wasn't amazingly warm or friendly. Was prompt but they just placed the plates on top of other things rather than trying to make space. We wanted to go to the ramen next door but the line was long and this had space. Should have waited."}
{"text":"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. It promises Mexican food unlike any other Mex restaurant I've ever been in - quasi fine cuisine..ish. The small setting is endearing and totally enjoyable.  And while the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...  No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.  I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.  My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.  Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80.   To add insult to injury, because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.  Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.  For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.  If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively."}
{"text":"This is a great little place I would suggest takeout as there are only a couple of tables inside. The food is authentic Mexican the beach needs more options like this I definitely will return."}
{"text":"I am constantly on the look for authentic and AMAZING mexican food. Not the TEX MEX crap, but truly stunning variations on healthy and zesty mexican dishes. XOLA blew my f'ing socks off! Wow. I haven't stopped raving about it for days now. The chef worked at a very famous spanish restaurant that was quite successful and decided to bring authentic mexican food (with a twist!) to Toronto. Run, don't walk. Be sure to try the cactus and pineapple guacamole."}
{"text":"Pros: delicious and authentic Cons: small, overcrowded, way overpriced.   Good, but would not be inclined to go often, only if I lack inspiration that particular evening and don't want to venture very far."}
{"text":"It was astounding! How many Burritos can a Mexican roll if a Mexican can roll Burritos?  The answer to that riddle is as hard to fathom as how beautifully rolled and shaped as the Burrito de Barbacoa de Borrego($8.95) that was placed before me.  No spillage, no fall-overs, tight-knit, hand-on-pole diameter, balanced-ratio of fillings with nice blend of flavors.  Ay, caramba!   http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/xola-mexican-food-toronto?select=ZjChIyyAtPnp7HelCBeSlA#c1NeoS6uKRFN-qSYczKZbg  ...and as I smirk considering my choice of Menu Item had my friend clearly beat.  Ay Dios Mio!  Fish Tacos($15.00), I admit defeat on the first bite. The breading never became soggy after an extended time while the Basa fillet stays moist, along with some 'slaw, avocado and habanero mayo even the cheapass in me had to say it was worth every peso.   http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/xola-mexican-food-toronto?select=ZjChIyyAtPnp7HelCBeSlA#0GpytdQPh5uUFtAVQfIoqg  Next time around, I'm going to savour the meal with a Rum & Coke - Mexican style."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in my life and I've lived in Southern California for 2 years.  I usually get the homemade guacamole and chips (hands down the best I've had in my life - the chips are homemade as well) and fish tacos (incredible flavor, makes Grand Electric look like a joke).  I've tried others items as well and everything has that fresh, homemade quality.  This is an absolute gem in T.O., not many people know about it, but it's probably some of the best Mexican food you can get anywhere in the world."}
{"text":"The menu was a little confusing to read at first, but I ended up ordering fried basa filet taquitos.  With the famous habanero sauce, it was absolutely delish.  The habanero was still no match for me when it comes to spicy.  Sangria had to have been the best I've tried as compared to Chilean.  Worth coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"This is perhaps our family's favourite restaurant - period. The food is amazing - authentic Mexican, fresh, delicious. The service is great - friendly and helpful. We highly recommend it, although kind of don't want to because we'd like to keep it for ourselves!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I have ever had!  Since I had never been, I asked the server for a vegetarian recommendation.  She suggested  the \"Cazuela de Champinones\" which was the mushroom dish.  It was essentially a big bowl of oil with mushrooms at the bottom and a few tortillas laid flat on top of the bowl.  I wasn't even sure where to start....there was absolutely no flavour besides the plain oil.  I couldn't finish my meal and it was the most bland dish I have ever tasted.  Shared the goat cheese guac with my friend and it was okay, but still pretty flavourless.  My friend on the other hand had ordered a meat dish as her main meal and she was happy with it.  Definitely way better Mexican places in the city that are worth going to (especially if you are vegetarian)!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Xola - the food was amazing! Fresh tasting. The flavours were outstanding! My wife had the Cuban stuffed pepper (with Shrimp). I had the Tacos elitos baja. Very very tasty! Our drinks were out of this world! I had the Michelada (hope I spelled it correctly) which is a \"spice beer\". You can add the spice to one their beer selections. Perfect combination with the food. So good, it is easy to forget how many you have (luckily we live around the corner - so we walked!). My wife's margarita was also very tasty. Very fresh. No bar mix here! Highly recommend Xola's. The food has just the right amount of heat to awaken your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely place, excellent food, a really friendly owner, and a nice low key atmosphere. The guacamole varieties are great, and the horchata is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican in the city. Traditional dishes each have their own inspired twist. Ingredients are all top notch, and the care of preparation is appropriately considered \"homemade\"; the quality of food is therefore excellent. Portions are deceptively filling. The prices may seem a little high but they're well worth it. Cash only is a bit of a drag, but come prepared and forget about it. The place is incredibly small, which adds to the intimate atmosphere, though for their own sake I wish they had more space. If you can make it to the East End, make it here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Me and my husband have been coming here for years.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is delicious.  The prices may shock you at first but all the produce and meat is well sourced and the portions are quite large so you really get what you pay for.  We always make sure to try at least one new thing off the menu whenever we go and are never disappointed.  The food is always fresh and bright and completely satisfying and the close, intimate setting always reminds us of my husband's mother's kitchen.   A great hidden gem and a must try in the city.  It's definitely worth a walk along Queen street."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Had a birthday lunch here, the food was so flavourful and portions were good. Dinner here was fantastic. Our server was a wonderful, cheerful fellow. My boyfriend had a lamb dish and I had fish tacos. Again the flavours were bang on and portions were good. The meat served comes from Royal Beef (on the Danforth) and is hormone and anti-biotic free. The Hibiscus Margarita was lovely. I would not recommend this place for children or larger groups as it is very small and seating is tight. It's nice to have a Mexican restaurant of this quality in the east end."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy with friendly service.  Dinner was good but not wow.  We had Barbacoa de Borrego and Chocinita Pibli, both were good but you only get tortillas, a very small cup of beans and pineapple salsa.  No rice.  Both dinners were appetizer sized and priced $18-$20 each. For starters we had guacamole sampler which was excellent but definitely overpriced @ $18.    I would recommend this place but beware of portion size for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, nice folks, food is ok. But too pricey. Why no beans and rice with the Entres? And why is beer 8 bucks a bottle?"}
{"text":"I've never eaten in, only had take out. Had fish tacos first time and they were good. Ordered fish tacos and the trio De gorditas the second time for dinner with my boyfriend, the tacos were good but the gorditas were soggy and lacked flavor.   Cost about $30 and I found the portions small. It's the only Mexican place in the beach but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful authentic homemade cuisine pork tacos were unbelievable and the guac with cactus and pineapple was surprisingly delicious! Staff very kind and genuine, a great local spot cozy and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This is a little Mexican restaurant in the Beaches operated by a couple. The food is good and authentic. The service is friendly. The price is a little bit pricy."}
{"text":"How is this place still a secret? Chef Mali is as authentic as it gets. Her sauces are so good i could bathe in it. In a city that's caught the gourmet taco craze, this is where you need to go to base yourself and then compare.    I'm drooling just thinking about this place. It's really such a gem. Cab, TTC, drive, bike, do whatever you have to do. Just get there.   And also as a tip - her brunch menu is the best in the city in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very small but very delicious. I have been trying to find the best Mexican food in the city and this one definitely beats out the rest. We goat the goat cheese and sun-dried  guacamole, it was amazing!! The tacos are delicious and just the right portions and amount of spices.  Also the best margaritas! Definitely recommend the Hibiscus one.  A hot spot in the beaches for sure!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Andres. The food is delicious--among the best Mexican food I have eaten--and the service is pleasant. However, it is expensive and the servings are small. This is what you might expect in more upscale surroundings, but it's a bit shocking to pay $7 for a beer in a restaurant that's so casual you aren't automatically given a glass. I'm not sure how busy Xola will be once the novelty wears off."}
{"text":"My favourite Mexican restaurant in Toronto. My husband and I go there very frequently and get the - guacamole, fish tacos, pork tacos, steak (with plaintains/cactus), and/or rice and beans. When we do take out we get the burritos. And our fav drink after a hard week - the margarita - is to die for! Everything is packed full of flavour and their house made hot sauce is for spice lovers - SO GOOD! I highly recommend this place for the food and service. Mali and her husband are some of the nicest hosts who genuinely care to give their customers quality food and a great experience."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the Beach, and some of the best Mexican food in the city. Not the cheapest, but the food is high quality. Great margaritas, guacamole, and tacos. Fish tacos are light and delicate, with a lovely balance of flavours and texture."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy family atmosphere and authentic menu. Mediocre food for the price though. Bill gets expensive fast -$60 for 2 people no liquor. Service was rushed, plates taken away quickly while still eating, bill brought out right away. Overall out dining experience felt  \"turn and burn\" get customers in and out fast and they made sure to get us out in under 45 minutes (it was early and a slow night, no wait). The whole experienced felt rushed and expensive. Won't be back. Disappointing because reviews were so positive."}
{"text":"Good Eats can be that simple and I love how Xola Mexican Food prepares their food. Fresh ingredients and with a touch of love, herbs and spices, Mexican Food is just that simple.  The interior is small and cozy. We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. Service can be a little slow as Xola is more like a family run and with only 1 chef and 1 server working here during our visit.  We shared:   Horchata ($3.50) - I never really into Horchata and I found their version not as nutty and creamy as I preferred - maybe adding rum to become Ronchata next time!  Burrito Lamb ($8.95) - slow cooked pulled lamb was so soft and moist with a lot of flavour  Fish Taco ($15) - fish has a nice and firm texture and the breading was so light and crispy! - love the spicy mayo, guacamoles, pickled cabbage and everything just go so well together!  Good Mexican food is hard to find in Toronto and of course I would be coming back to Xola for more!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last Friday night with my boyfriend. It had a very cozy and authentic Mexican atmosphere. The owner was very friendly too. We had the nachos with three different dippings, pork tacos and fish tacos. All were very good!! If you like authentic (and spicy) Mexican food, then this is the place for you! The food was a bit pricy but worth it. The margarita was good too, not stingy on the alcohol."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto... The other comments stating the same fact are true. The chef and family cook with heart and the result is pure authentic Mexican food that is definitely top class. We tried the steak taco and duck confit... Our taste buds were having a feista on their own.   Highly recommend this restaurant and will come back for repeat visits."}
{"text":"What are you waiting for? run!! don't walk to this amazing little (kinda new) Mexican joint in the Beaches. These guys are cooking up some really great authentic Mexican cuisine and it is well worth the trip east to give them a try"}
