{"text":"So... after countless years, Peter Street Deli is no longer. They posted a sign on Monday citing \"Retirement\" as the reason for closure.

Where am I going to get a delicious club sandwich for under ten dollars now? Or chicken leg specials on Wednesdays? Or fish n chips on Fridays? This diner was a fucking institution and I'm very sad to see it go. Let's hope they don't erect a condo in it's place."}
{"text":"I used to love going here when I worked across the street, cause I was guaranteed two meals when I ordered their Chinese food.

I've never really enjoyed their burger, but I've definitely ordered it more than once. not sure what that tells you. either i have a horrible memory, or there's something about it...i guess when you want a burger, you want a burger. 

Get the Fried Rice, snag some pork and chicken in it, and then load on that Wing's hot sauce, which is so damn good.  And you have yourself a delicious, spicy meal and leftovers for later."}
{"text":"I was very sad to see the \"Closed for ever\" sign on the door when I went there for lunch today.

I am sure Ma and Pa were probably tired and looking to take some rest, but I do miss the place.  Used to go there for lunch about once a week - and although have tried many dished, my favourites remain \"Szechuan veggie/ Szechuan beef and Singapore Noodles.

Ed - if you are reading this, I really hope you buy the business from your folks and continue the fantastic tradition of serving tasty meals priced for the hungry.

{"text":"This is a great spot for some greasy spoon food.  I come here often for lunch, my favourite dishes being the club house sandwich and general tso's chicken.  Yes, they also serve Chinese food.

If you're ordering during the lunch rush (or even if you're not) it's a good idea to call ahead.  Know what you want in advance because Andy, the guy who's always operating the cash and answering the phone, is usually super busy keeping the orders flowing.  

There's some seating space as well, and if you go in a group, sharing plates is always a good idea.  Worried each person might not have enough of what they want when a dish is split in 4?  Just ask for a larger size dish.  It'll cost a bit extra, but that way everyone's full and everyone's happy."}
{"text":"Similar to the GOOF or Garden Gate Restaurant, Peter Street Deli serves Canadian-ized Chinese food with a plethora of other options (hamburgers, sandwiches, milkshakes).

They're famous for their Lemon Chicken dish. Light crispy batter cover chicken breasts and accompanied with a light lemon sauce and it comes with fried rice. You'll see many of the police go there for that dish.

It's nice to come here when you want something light on your wallet, heavy in your belly and has options to please almost everyone. 

Just note; you may come out of there smelling a little greasy but that's never stopped me before."}
