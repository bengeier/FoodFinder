{"text":"Its a small little diner. Very casual. They serve breakfast and lunch. It doesn't look like much as you drive  but it is a nice place to go to get a  quick bite. Food has always been good."}
{"text":"People were nice but this place is so dirty. Even the blinds are dirty. I couldn't eat my food."}
{"text":"First off their breakfast special is now $2.95 (it was $2.85). Great place to have an  honest American breakfast with the family. Eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast what a great way to start the day.  
Yes you can go to Cafe Monte or Zebras for a high end breakfast with a price to match, but leave your S Class Mercedes in the garage and head out to Monroe in your pickup truck and treat yourself to an all American breakfast like the ones you remember having as a kid. 
The staff are all hard working and friendly so be generous when you feed the tip jar. And no I have no relationship to anyone who works there."}
{"text":"Found this spot through Yelp and GLAD we decided to stop and eat. Not a fancy restaurant but DEFINITELY great food and great service!   Will be back the next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Ron's is definitely a dive 100% no frills. They have a 2.99 breakfast special eggs, meat, hash browns, buciut which is a great price. I got the western omelet it was good the grits were a little too watery for me. I haven't had anything else other than breakfast so I can't review them, but I hear The burgers are amazing. And all their prices are great!"}
{"text":"Best little spot for breakfast and lunch!  Friendly staff good food and fast service."}
{"text":"GREAT!!! burgers.  I am all about a good hamburger and this was the best one I have found in NC.  

Service was very quick.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  

Can't wait to go back & try breakfast."}
{"text":"Very friendly place with great home cooking. We got there just before the lunch hour rush and good thing we did. This place is the best little hole in the wall (in a good way) I've ever been to. We had the southern steak, delicious."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover! 

Ron's doesn't look like much from the outside and, honestly, it's not fancy on the inside either, but it's good...very good, in fact. The prices are unbelievably affordable, the service is super friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Everything is cooked to order so it's served hot and fresh. 

Judging by the number of regulars that the staff knew by name, Ron's seems to be a local favorite....and with good reason."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm, what do you say about a restaurant that's older than me and is still as popular as ever?  This place is a local favorite and why not.  They have a full breakfast for 2.99 and a whole other full menu.  The staff is nice enough and the food is hot.  Other than that don't expect much.  It's mostly locals and elderly at this place but the town wouldn't be the same without it.  It's good food for a good price!  Sanitation grade was mid 90s"}
{"text":"This is a little breakfast and lunch joint in monroe. It's pretty convenient if you want a fresh, hot, cheap meal. The service is excellent and food is always good for the price. Only thing lacking is the environment there. The tables and chairs and whole look of the diner is not very appealing at all. If I didn't know the food was good I wouldn't eat there based on appearance. That being said, to get eggs, hash brown, bacon and toast for $2.85, it's hard to beat. Definitely recommend for a quick breakfast, but you wouldn't want to bring a business lunch to this place. I would definitely recommend though."}
