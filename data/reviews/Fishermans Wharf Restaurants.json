{"text":"Seafood  was frozen resulting in overcooked and chewy lobster.  Expensive and  dishes were uninspired and  poor.  Bartender didn't know how to make a gin gimlet. After couple of attempts finally got a drink which was just ok.  Birthday weekend celebration.  This restaurant failed to deliver delicious and fresh seafood, expected. Normally during celebration would have indulge with a dessert.  Left without dessert. Would not  recommend."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 10 for lunch on a Friday. The restaurant was empty the whole time we were there. I ordered the lobsterlicious 3 course meal $27. The appetizer lobster bisque was just salty and only had 2 tiny pieces of lobster. The entr√©e lobster salad was a good portion however the lobster was over cooked and chewy. It was hard to get service as no one was out front. Had to wait so long for the bill even when we were the only table in the whole restaurant. And the waiter even calculated our bill wrong. Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"had two lobster dishes, had lots of seafood inside the dishes but the taste and presentation is not very impressing.

overall just ok food, but the atmosphere was good. Over $100 for 2."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, it was just terrible.

Nothing was fresh or seemed to be made with care.  The lobster burger was bland, like it was put in the microwave, before being tossed on two cold buns. Fries similarly tasted like it was reheated straight from the freezer.

The place has an identity problem. There's an affordable lunch menu on display out front, which is why I went during my break, but once inside I get offered a wine menu (for lunch?) and wait 40 minutes for a burger. Our group were the only people there and we ordered simple meals too. The decor is like my grandparents living room.

I get that I should expect much from a lobster burger or plain old fish and chips, but they have to get basics right. The food tasted stale and like something I could buy from a grocery store freezer. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this restaurant.

A guest from Japan wanted to try this restaurant because it was recommended in a guide book.

-The service was horrendous! Even though we ordered the most expensive lobster special, I felt like the waiter was harassing us to order more - really unfriendly and unpleasant. Even after the food was brought to our table the waiter told us it is not enough for us and suggested that we order more.
-The bread they served was crusty to the inside. I asked for some fresh bread and they served another crusty one that was warmer.
-The actual meal: the lobster, crab and shrimp tasted stale like old frozen food left out to thaw for days.
-The lighting was dark and dank. The restaurant is tiny and cramped.
-The meals are insanely overpriced.

We could have gone to St. Lawrence Market and eaten the same meal - albeit better tasting - for 1/3 of the price. The other funny thing was that the all the customers there were Japanese! If it weren't for that one guide book, this restaurant would probably be out of business."}
{"text":"I think the seafood was avg, I had the scallops. The cocktails are good, highlight of the visit.

I think Adega houses the best seafood in T.O, and F.W pales in comparison.

The decor is nice, it is a small resto.  Big price for small food.

 Been here once, and that will suffice."}
{"text":"Sorry --this was a big letdown. You can see that the splashy paid ads in the hotel \"Welcome to Toronto\" magazines really amount to BS. Yeah, this place that was \"voted\" as the \"best\" and \"most memorable\" meal in Toronto.This is a lie. There is nothing at all memorable or recommendable about this dark, creepy establishment. Go to other places in the city --there has to be better seafood than this.

Lowlights: a listless cream of spinach soup billed as having chunks of lobster. The \"chunks\" resembled wisps of hair and were barely there. Soup was bland and runny. \"Trio\" of appetizer, expensive at $22, was a cruddy, lifeless crab cake that tasted like sawdust, a miniscule shrimp tempura (that last word was suspect), and a lobster roll that was probably a frozen entree. The grilled halibuts were fine, I suppose, but two tiny pieces of roasted potatoes underneath this piled-on dish? 

We shouldn't have ordered the garlic cheese bread because it tasted like it had been stepped on, and had no garlic taste whatsoever.

Waited for a long while for our iced teas, sweetened, and realized that for $4 we paid for small bottles of Lipton Iced Tea that we could paid for much less at the 7-11 next door.

Dessert was a creme brulee that was passable and a mixed berries plate with black cherry ice cream. Most interesting pricing on the dessert menu was: mixed berries $10, Mixed berries and ice cream was also $10. Sure, everything makes sense."}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was poor.  Expensive menu, average food, poor selection of beer and wine, frozen/package vegetables, no personal attention from servers.  All around fail.  Don't go to this restaurant; there are plenty of other really great options within a couple blocks."}
{"text":"My family of 4 each ordered Caesar salads for $10 each and seafood bakes which were enjoyable.  They each came with grilled vegetables.  The entrees were $32 to $36 each.  The Lobster Thermidor was very good and had a good amount of lobster in cheese sauce.  The Coquille St Jacques had a lot of seafood and the Cheese Crab Bakes were also very good.  This place is no bargain but haven't found many in Canada.  The restaurant is small and has a basic atmosphere.  We heard the table behind us complaining that their rib eye steak was a strip steak.  

I main pet peeve is that they charged $2.50 for each pop or iced tea refill and didn't mention it in advance."}
{"text":"I've never understood how this place has been around for so long.
If it wasn't for their location and good hotel marketing, this place would have run out of business so fast because the food just isn't that good. The first time i ever went many years ago, I felt slightly ripped off. The second time i went on a work event and i expected a little more based on the rage, and again i was let down. The third time was at the choice of an out of town friend who really wanted to go...and i regret every bleeding moment and morsel. There will never be a fourth time. 

It's like that bad booty call who's number you wish you just deleted but didn't have enough self respect to do."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the few restaurants that I do not like and will never go back. The restaurant itself is small (holds only 40-50 people) and the waiter we had seemed disinterested in serving us.
The food itself seems like it came out of a fish and chip truck. I ordered the seafood combo, which should come with fish, shrimps, and scallops. They didn't have any shrimps the night we went so they gave me more scallops. Everything on my plate was deep fried. (fries, scallops and fish). The portion was smaller than a red lobster dinner. For a dish to cost $29 I would expect a chef to make it with unique and fresh ingredients (or something to that effect), not everything deep fried. I can deep fry this stuff myself.
To top it off, it really irks me when you order a pop, and you get it in a juice glass at $2.50 per glass."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly the reason why everyone should have the YELP app and check it religiously before trying a new unknown restaurant. 

Having worked in the Financial District for several years I have walked past this restaurant on numerous times. With a family member staying at the Sheraton, we were looking for a place to eat and they pointed out this restaurant across the way. When we walked in we were the only guests on a Thursday night at dinner time and while we were there for about 3 hours, they only had 2 other tables in total (1 group came and left when looking at the menu). 

In terms of the actual food - it is overpriced for the quality/size and further, the freshness of the food was suspect. The one highlight on the menu was the VQA wine which was delicious (House Merlot I believe). I ordered the steak and it was supposedly 12 OZ - a good portion of it was fat and it was not cooked through properly. I am 100% sure it had been frozen for quite sometime. Another guest had the seafood platter and half of it was left on the plate due to poor quality. The final guest had a seafood linguini pasta and they said it was good - with that in mind, when a pasta is the best dish at a seafood restaurant, that is very problematic. 

On a final note, our waiter kept pitching us constantly on things we didn't want - do you want garlic cheese bread, do you want this, do you want that? They obviously are under a lot of pressure to get the average bill up as they clearly don't have the customer base - This is a restaurant that should be featured on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares!"}
