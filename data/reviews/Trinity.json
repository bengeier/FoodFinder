{"text":"Close your eyes and pretend you're going on holiday to Greece... instead of Winnipeg.  This was an unexpected breakfast in the airport.  They've put blue check table cloths and blue chairs in a busy food court, but the staff make it better.    The breakfast sausage is cooked on the grill and tasted like it was barbecued on charcoal!"}
{"text":"Filled the gap! Was looking for something less greasy on my stopover & this little Greek place fit the bill.   Had souvlaki, which comes with pita & side salad. Tasted fresh & was exactly what I expected. Bonus that they had plus to get my phone charged up while dining.   I will definitely eat there again given the chance!"}
{"text":"Opa!!! Time to celebrate break some fine china 'cause we have winner. Finally it looks like an airport got it right by allowing these guys to set up shop past gate A nestled next to a Starbucks and Canadians bar lounge. It looks like it may be managed by the head chef of its name sake that closed downtown. Have the lamb gyro. You won't be disappointed!"}
