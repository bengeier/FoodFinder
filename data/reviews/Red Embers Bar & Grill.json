{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews for this place. I've eaten both in the restaurant and had stuff brought over while I'm bowling, and it's always been good. The prices are a bit high, but it's definitely a step up from usual bowling alley food.  I can't comment on the bar, as I don't drink. The food I've had has always been good. They have 1/2 appetizers happy hour on weekdays until 6pm, and most will come in at $5, which for the quality of food is quite decent. I've had a couple of their pizza's, and they're probably the bets pizza in Surprise (which I know, isn't hard to do.)  They do have a bit of a clash as they apear to be trying for a bar and upscale restaurant feel, but they're in a bowling alley / laser tag / arcade establishment .... It can get noisy, and it doesn't really work for kids; though I usually don't see them in there."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday afternoon to have a few beers and something to eat. I ordered wings but I wanted them to be all drumsticks, no flaps (yeah I know..flats...whatever). The bartender declined and said they do not allow wings to be served only drums or flaps. First red flag. We decided to get the artichoke hearts instead. When they came out, I realized they are nothing more than the artichoke hearts you buy in a jar (in oil) and fried. The temperature was lukewarm but the pita bread that comes with the hearts were really good. We ate those, left the hearts, briefly looked around for a manager to no avail, paid the bill and went to another restaurant where I ordered wings the way I wanted them. I would advise you avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place for happy hour with great bartenders!  Holly always remembers our drinks and serves them with a smile!"}
{"text":"We went into Uptown Alley for a family night of bowling and games. Our bowling experience was wonderful.  While our kids went to play games my husband and I went into the Red Embers for coffee and dessert, we were seated right away. We then waited 10-15 min at our table while servers were coming and going right past us. Not one server acknowledged our existence. THE SERVICE AT THIS RESTAURANT IS AWFUL!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this a few times with the family. I like this place a lot. The food is always very good when we have gone there. We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place and have been several times. The first time was opening weekend and I waited 2 1/2 hrs. for my meal after waiting 30 mins to be seated in a dining room that wasn't filled. Once seated my server was excellent but a manager was extremely rude when I wanted to comment on how good our server was when he went out of his way to try and get us a discount for waiting so long. I returned with the hope that things had gotten better and the food was less than edible. It isn't worth the high prices. When I went a third time to try and enjoy other parts of Uptown Alley I found out that one of my favorite bartenders had quit because of problems with management. This place needs to work on keeping the good servers and bartenders because that is one of the reasons that I will not be returning and will be sharing with anyone that I can that this place is not worth the time or money. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Thought it would be a nice break from cooking at home for a large family and brought them here and that was a huge mistake. The service is well below mediocre and the food is very much the same. The server demolished our order and when I finally got what I ordered I wished I had of settled for the beer that they couldn't screw up and waited to go home and eat leftovers. Kristin the service manager was awesome and understands how to make things right."}
{"text":"We used a coupon for buy one lunch item, get one free, and it still wasn't worth it!!! Even with the coupons that (per the staff ) everyone had today, there were only three other tables of diners at noon. The music was so loud inside the restaurant that we had to practically yell to our waiter to ask that it be turned down. Based on the few tables that were there, our food was very slow to come out. Once it arrived, my husband's fries were cold, and the portions were kid-sized for the price point. My $11 entr√©e salad was absent the garlic cheese bread that was supposed to accompany it. When I mentioned this to the waiter upon setting down my salad bowl, he told me that it was still baking. Fast forward 15 mins. to the last three bites of my salad, and the bread finally shows up. It's slightly warm on top, cheese not even melted, and no hint of garlic. Had the faux-hawked manager who was buzzing around asked us how everything was, we would have shared our experience, in hopes that he would get a handle on their dysfunctional kitchen. We will not go back again, even if the food was 100% free. It's just a waste of calories at this place, and I can make much better food at home."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite here on Halloween night,right next to a movie theatre. Service was friendly and they did a good job. Had as appetizer,stuffed meatballs,they were very tasty. Finished  off with lava cake,yum yum. Nice place,bar ,lots of tv's . Inside with a bowling alley and laser tag so there is lots to do close by. Great visit. Live music also."}
{"text":"Bartenders need to take some classes, they are terrible. Unaware on how to make simple classics. No fresh juices are used and most flavors are synthetic."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and burgers, and a good selection of beer as well.  A Ginormous screen on which to watch playoff games, and the crowd was certainly enjoying the view! Service was really terrible - unfortunately the server was trying to cover too much ground and she just couldn't pay any attention to us."}
{"text":"food sucks on all accounts.  Service is mediocre at best.  But the kids can play at the alley for $10 a piece while we get some breathing room, so that earns it 2 stars."}
{"text":"We stopped in after the kids played laser tag for an appetizer but ended up staying for a meal.  $2 draft beers for happy hour, $4 appetizers including a big plate of nachos and wings. We stayed for a flat bread pizza which I loved and the kids split a burger which was cooked medium to perfection. Very pleasant surprise in a bowling alley."}
{"text":"I have to say the food has gotten better. It is still hit or miss with service but food is on an uptick."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get together with friends for food and drinks in the Surprise area. The staff is friendly, the food is upper quality bar fare, and there is an  abundance of screens if you want to watch sports. Don't expect a quiet place, though, as this opens into the bowling alley and the kids' arcade. But if you do want a more quiet atmosphere, go to the al fresco dining area outside."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside Uptown Alley, the new bowling alley/arcade/laser tag complex in Surprise. My husband and I were there on a Wednesday night just a week after they opened. I am sure they had some kinks to work out, but I would definitely go there again to eat. Nice bar with lots of TVs and a huge projector screen for us sports fans. The restaurant was clean, and the staff friendly. We were seated right away as it wasn't crowded, but I heard that there was a line out the door just to enter the building on opening weekend. Not sure if it has already, but the novelty is bound to wear off eventually.   As for the food.... Blackened Mahi sandwich tasted good, but overpriced for the little amount of fish I got. The California Chicken sandwich also tasted good, and was much more reasonably priced. Two complaints I had about the food though.... sandwiches were supposed to be served on a Kaiser Roll, but were served on a hamburger bun. (I know it's tough to find good bread out here, but there's a big difference between Kaiser roll and hamburger bun.) The other complaint I had was in regard to the side of fruit. Technically it was fresh fruit, but it must have been an old batch. Soft, mushy and each piece of fruit lost its individual flavor.   All in all, I had a good experience here, and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I've been a number of times to Red Embers and have never had a bad visit. The service is always friendly and prompt though I will admit, it's a bit less prompt at lunchtime which appears to be the time of day when they are training newbies.   I've had a wide variety of menu items and while none have disappointed, my favorites are the chicken pesto flatbread and the veggie tacos.   Look forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Adding a little class to a Alley.   Let's be real, nobody likes Alley ball food.  It's mostly chemical preservatives and Gov'ment cheese microwaved within an inch of its life.   But then there is Red Embers.   Better then I expected, given the relative low reviews. Though I could t really articulate what I anticipated--a bowling pin cut vertically and steamed to be served like artichoke hearts, a bowling ball burger made with real bowling ball, alley shoes mixed in to the nachos sprinkled with foot powder...   My imagination runs scared at the thought.   But nah, we were pleasantly surprised with the Service & Food.   So much better then Alley-Ball Food. that's why I'm giving this places a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Table was dirty, menus were filthy and covered with dried and sticky food. Granddaughter got mini hamburgers and couldn't eat them they were so dry and stale. Service was VERY under staffed so the service was horrible.  Nice looking place, but won't be back."}
{"text":"The new menu is darn good. The food is good although the kitchen definitely needs a major improvement.  We waited 40 minutes for dinner and that is simply unacceptable. The managers don't seem to have a grasp of their restaurant and kitchen.   The Juicy Lucy is really good. Hear flavor, big burger at a fair price.   Everyone enjoyed their food although the two build your own burgers we had with bacon both had cold bacon. For $2 and 40 minutes I definitely expect nice hot bacon on my burger. Them again after 40 minutes what do you expect.   Hopefully management greatly improves.  They have a very good product potentially."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, have no problem! We have had their pizza, burgers, nachos, and my favorite! Coconut Shrimp! Yes, this is a little pricier! Yes, Surprise is trying to be the West Valley Scottsdale! Nothing wrong with that! It's going to take trial by error to make things better! Some of their food needs to improve, but with the choices at that area! Red Embers is a must try choice!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. The food is good and the drinks are good. It's a bit pricey for drinks. I was the DD for the night, and had to buy a soda at the restaurant and then didn't get refills. I was weird. I don't know that we'll be back. But it was just ok."}
{"text":"Took my kids and nieces here awhile back. It's like the are trying to bring a little bit of Scottsdale to Surprise. Upscale designer food with upscale designer prices.   Not good for kids, over priced. In a bowling alley you need options for kids - families. This isn't it. There should be something for them. The Alley is big enough to have a mom and pop diner among the mix.   Good for dates, couples, over 21 people. Good for those who want to spend $20 on a caesar salad and soda. Which the salad sucked. My bill was over $90 (not incl tip) for 3 adults and 3 kids, for lunch!"}
{"text":"Red Embers could be better. Service was slow, friendly enough, but slow. Food wasn't great. We ordered a few different things from the menu. I tried a wing and put it down after one bite. Sauce smelled weird. IMO chicken tasted as if pre-cooked, held in fridge for awhile, and just dropped into a fryer to be crisped to order, not completely fresh cooked. (reminded me of when you eat yesterday's chicken leftovers.) Pizza wasn't great. We had two. They looked visually appealing and generously sized, but none had great flavor. One seemed slightly doughy/undercooked. I would almost have preferred Little Caesar's to that pizza, if that says anything. Maybe we should have gotten burgers. Fries and chicken fingers were decent, so they have that. :)  The place was clean. It's convenient if want food while at Uptown Alley (they serve the bowling lanes too). Prices were reasonable for amount of food. If only the food were a little bit better, it could be a 3 or 4 star place. Probably won't return any time soon. I'd be more likely to just order some fries at the bowling lane if we get hungry while bowling."}
{"text":"Came in to eat ...restaurant part was closing so we sat at the tables behind the lanes and not one employee offered to wait on us...where we were told served food until 11...first time here and so disappointing...waited 15 mins...walked to restaurant to complain and was not acknowledged by bartender cashing her drawer out or the Manager who was wearing a rust colored shirt...! That sucked!"}
{"text":"First of all.... we went here to celebrate my nephew's 12th birthday.  Secondly, the bowling alley/arcade and laser tag were all a major hit.... lots of fun.  We decided to have lunch here... and I decided to have the Cobb Salad; the kids had pizza (which they all said \"tasted funny\"). Three-hours later... the WORST food poisoning I've ever EXPERIENCED ensued!!!!  And it lasted 48-hours!!! The most painful 20-lbs I've ever lost.  I left several messages for the manager to call me back - but to no avail.  I'm never-ever... EVER returning to this bacteria-infested septic tank."}
{"text":"* food ok. * food came out luke warm. NOT HOT! * service with a full staff of people walking around soooooooo slow! * likely will not return  I am not sure why this place can not have better leadership or staff. The service does not seem to be urgent with anything when waiting on tables. To get a check back seemed to take forever!"}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming food....too bad, nice place, good bar, service was good, but the food was just eh!"}
{"text":"We had terrible service. Waiter couldn't even bring us water in a reasonable time. It tasted like water from toilet. Ordered a salad and soup. They brought one salad and one soup. Waiter said she had to make dressing and it took a long time. I wouldn't suggest anyone go there. And by the way the place was not busy. To many excuses , to little service."}
{"text":"It was Christmas night and my wife went out for our annual movie night.  This place was open so we grabbed a cocktail or seven and enjoyed all the other people celebrating their own post family Christmas.  The food was good and the drinks were poured well.  Staff was very friendly in-spite of working Christmas, everyone seemed to be in a good mood."}
{"text":"1st time here and so far I like it. Food is good and service is great. Staff is friendly and on time with drinks and food. Kids are having fun also. Place is very clean and I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Was here on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Throughout the course of the evening, I purchased an adult beverage at 3 different bars within the bowling alley. The beer  was flat and overpriced, and service was painstakingly slow. Management should hire more employees to help things run more smoothly and keep patrons happy and coming back.  The mixed drinks were overpriced as well, and food tasted stale (tortilla chips). Chairs were a little sticky, and empty bottles/glassware were left out long after they had been finished... I didn't see too many employees cleaning/wiping or bussing tables.  The atmosphere was lively and modern, and I liked the the layout of the entire establishment.  Will I go back? Definitely not to eat or drink. Maybe to bowl."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a quick meal at 6pm before Star Wars The Last Jedi starts next door at 7pm.  Walk in and theres only 2 other tables seated.  Wait 10 min to be seated.  Sit down order our drinks and a happy hour tacos.  Tacos and drinks come out in about 1 minute.  Awesome.  Order my kids food and another happy hour egg rolls.  40 minutes go by and nothing. Now about 9 tables are seated, all of which have their food.  Not like i ordered 10 entrees or anything, just got some mini sliders and mac n cheese for my kids.  Our food finally comes out and its a few minutes until our movie starts. We each take one bite and rush out to leave to not miss our movie.  We were also charged for kids sodas despite the fact that the menu states they are included for kids meals.  The mac and cheese had been sitting and was hard at the top. My son always eats his mac and cheese and didn't like it.  That says something. Never coming back again. Would love to hear some management feedback on this, as i wanted to come back and have a chat after the movie but my kids were tired. Spent $33 on one bite of food..."}
{"text":"When my husband and I went here we sat at the bar. My husband had ordered the popcorn crayfish and I got the hotwings. Im not a big fish eater but I tried my husbands crayfish and it was delicious! Food and service were a plus. Only bad thing was it was very noisy. The bar isnt really closed off from uptown alley itself. You can see kids across playing in the arcade room and people walking through to go bowling. All in all we had an enjoyable drink and snack before we walked over to the movie theatre."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Normally go here for happy hour. Looks like it would be a good place to go for some football watching as well."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  The sliders were grey.  The sweet potato fries must of been the bottom of the bag. All broken stubs. Over fried. And really a small portion. I laughed when the food was put down, it looked so bad.  I have 2 stars cause my husband was so hungry he said it tasted ok"}
