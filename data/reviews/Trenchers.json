{"text":"I've never, ever, had such good fish and chips.  l also had a prawn cocktail that was wonderful.  The portions of fish were massive.  I'd go there again and again if l lived there."}
{"text":"Best fish restaurant in Whitby, magpie has always been the well known one. But went to here instead to try something new. Perfect choice. The hake was perfect and the price was only an extra few quid from wht you would get at a takeaway.

The layout was American diner ish with booths for seating.

Close to the station

100% recommended"}
{"text":"A firm favourite of ours for about 15 years now, its always busy, the food is always fresh and their menu is wide and varied. Halibut is superb. You can have a nice chilly pint of lager with it, and he staff are always helpful. Their toilets are very impressive (I think they won an award for them some time ago???)  only problem is you can't park near it."}
{"text":"Lovely cod in batter and very nice chips. Mushy peas good too. Would recommend. Decor very stylish. Nice clean restaurant. Loses on star though for not having tomato ketchup."}
{"text":"We had had an afternoon and evening out in Whitby and another fish restaurant that was closing shortly recommended here.


 We were not disappointed. This is a modern trendy local fish restaurant, it was clean and the staff were pleasant and helpful.


 Being in Whitby we chose Fish and Chips and the quality and taste of the fish was excellent and would have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone fancying fish and chips.


 Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant that aswell as fish and chips give a great seafood and normal salad selection .
You get what you pay for and this place isn't cheap but we'll worth the money"}
{"text":"If you love fresh fish, this is one of the best places to eat it in Whitby. The large modern restaurant (with stained glass accents) has a good selection of fish dishes on the menu. They have daily specials, a bar, and handmade desserts. For large groups, they have a large room upstairs, and the toilets have won awards.


 The staff are lovely and make you feel at home. We eat here every time we visit Whitby and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"You gets what you pay for. This is the place for quality and quantity. Not cheap by any means but if you want cheap I could name one or two but you wouldn't like them-`not a lot`. I could also name one or two that are not so cheap but you probably wouldn't like them either. I stick to what I know is good and for me that is Trenchers."}
{"text":"Some of the best Fish 'n' Chips I've had. Very fresh, locally sourced and sustainably harvested fish as well as locally sourced potatoes! Lightly-battered and with little grease, this was a great meal. Directly across from the trail station, this restaurant will not disappoint if it's Fish 'n' Chips you're after.  Eat in or take away. Restrooms are also very nice--but upstairs."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!!! The fish is so fresh and the filets they use are ginormous!

Never have I had such flaky, buttery fish. Not only do they give a huge helping of fish filet, but there's a load of chips to go with it. I recommend sharing a fish & chip platter with a buddy (even though devouring it by yourself is tempting). Make sure to add malt vinegar for a little punch with all your lemon and tartar sauce goodness! If only I could come back again soon...

If you have large groups, definitely recommend reserving ahead of time. Be prepared to get some looks from all of those waiting in line though!"}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood salad, fish and chips, fish pie and everything tastes good. Highly recommend the seafood salad. Everything tasted really fresh!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here in hopes of \"excellent fish and chips\" that were promised by Lonely Planet.  (We would have gone to the famous Magpie Cafe, but it was closed.)

The fish was very good - very fresh and nicely cooked, but the batter was really bland and disappointing; not the greasy salty pub food that I was hoping for.  The chips were very yummy, but only after a lot of salting.  My companion had the steak pie (\"Highly Recommended\" on the menu) which was also a bit boring. It was a slice of a full pie, not an individual-sized one, so the ratio of crust : filling was too low.

The decore was sort a US Denny's - not nearly as cute or historic as many other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Went during Goth weekend so we were expecting a wait anywhere we went. We waited about 20 minutes outside. The host offered everyone a menu and asked how many were in each group. 
By the time we arrived inside, the host then asked if we were ok with a smaller booth (just two of us). It was nice that he asked instead of assuming!! Some people would have preferred a larger booth but we didn't mind! Waitstaff was kind, attentive and thoughtful. 
We both ordered a regular size fish and chips. It was huge!!! Wish I would have ordered a small! 

I recommend stopping here while in Whitby! The best part was the display of where the fish and potatoes were acquired! Fish from local fisherman and potatoes from local farmers! Super cool!"}
{"text":"If you want great fish and chips you'll find it here.  My family have been coming here for years and never a complaint. There's often quite a line to get in but it usually moves quickly and it's worth the wait!

The fish are brought in from Peterhead in Scotland now as Whitby no longer has boats that catch cod or haddock - but that's the same for all the fish shops. Look on the blackboards on the walls and you'll see which boat brought today's fish in. 

The batter is crisp and tasty and the chips British style (fries for the Americans!!). 

Leave room for desert. The Knickerbocker Glory is just, well, glorious!!"}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed, but it wasn't terrible.  Decor is kind of dated, and the fish and chips were average.  The knickerbocker dessert people were raving about was underachieving as well.  Still, the location makes this a worthwhile place to visit, so it wasn't all bad."}
{"text":"The Husband and I were trolling through Yelp to find a place in Whitby for some fish & chips when we found this place, it had rave reviews so we thought we'd give it a go.

First off, there is no on-site parking. The restaurant is located just in front of a round-about so you're going to have to find parking elsewhere. There is a pay and display parking lot for the co-op and train station just katty-corner to the restaurant itself, but make sure you have change on you as it doesn't take cards- just cash and will run you £2 for 1 hour and £3 for 2 hours.

When we got there, we were the last two people who could fit inside the door of those waiting to be seated. The restaurant is not small but it did have a queue of people waiting to be seated. The wait staff were definitely busy. Once inside, it was quite warm and there were chalk board signs telling you from which ships the fish you'll be eating was caught that morning.

And then there's the menu itself. Nothing on this is particularly cheap, so if you do come, be prepared to open your wallet a bit. They have a very large menu and a very wide selection from which to choose, so although they do the classic fish and chips, that is not all they do and we saw plenty of people who had ordered something different.

However, we both had come knowing we were going to order the fish and chips. The fish was really good, the chips... not so much. I've had much better chips elsewhere, but still, the fish was good. Not as good as The Brown Room in Filey, but still, pretty darn tasty. I would quite happily return here if someone suggested it and, I would be happy to suggest this place should someone request a recommendation.  However, due to the price of the fish and chips, I don't think this is someplace one would pick as a one's local chippy.

Himself and I each ordered the regular sized fish and chips, I ordered a Diet Coke, and a tea (I was cold) and he ordered a coffee. All together it was about £34

By the time we paid and left, there was a queue of at least half a dozen people standing outside the door waiting to come in, so it's obviously a happening and very popular place to eat."}
{"text":"I wish i could put something that no one else had but I can't. The fish and chips are the best I've ever had. Fresh cod, great batter and cooked perfectly. We had a party of 8 and were sat fast and the food was out even faster. The only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is the lasagna and salad were both weird and unappetizing. My wife doesn't eat fish and ordered the lasagna and she wishes that she's wouldn't of."}
