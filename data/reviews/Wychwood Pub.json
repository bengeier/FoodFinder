{"text":"If the place smelling like a toilet wasn't bad enough, the service was almost as bad. Come on guys - St. Clair West is stepping up - you need to as well. I thought that when Legends closed that something better might move in. Didn't happen. Really disappointing. I'll give you another chance in a couple of months because you're in the neighbourhood, so please read this and improve!"}
{"text":"Very cold atmosphere. It feels like eating in a dungeon. Considering the location of this \"pub \", the food does not even have to be good, which it isn't, to be successful. A half decent atmosphere with mediocre service and some cold craft beer is all it takes to be successful in this area. I am dumbfounded how this place has gone so awry. They need to put some stuff on the walls, give it a warmer feel and replace the horrible tin can speakers with a proper sound system. I really wanted this place to be good as it is a block from my home. If they make some changes, I'll give it another go, but until then, I ll walk 20min to the next pub down St. Clair Ave West."}
{"text":"Hey, have a heart 1 star reviewers.  The food here is what you expect, if it is a bit pricey yes.  But the servers are friendly and hard working.  All in all its a good place to catch a sports game."}
{"text":"Service was good when I came, it's clean and newly renovated. I had two beers with good service. She was attractive too which is always a plus. I didn't eat but I plan to go back, hopefully I'll get the same waitress."}
{"text":"It's true, this place has its ups and downs. Be warned: DO NOT have high expectations when you walk through the door. The ambiance & atmosphere (given a makeover on a reality TV series) is enjoyable and chic. Order 1 pint (or pitcher, to make it worth your $$), and call it a night. Don't order food (unless it's breakfast), and if you do, don't expect it to come quickly or the way you ordered it. The die-hard customers will keep this place afloat."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. It has a lot of potential to amp up the interior design and service and it could be good. But as of right now it seems like a place you go to out of locational convenience. The interior has been newly renovated so it seems nice but feels terribly empty in every sense of the word. Feels abandoned and cold. The food was actually quite good though!! But the prices are a bit ridiculous. For example, the salads are about $9-$11 each, but if you want to add any protein to the salad you're looking at an up charge of even over $10. That basically doubles the cost. They need to keep up with the big chains and they only charge about $5 for a protein addition. Also their cocktails are way too expensive for the value you get.   The service was okay, the first older lady had a problem with my friend using her health card as ID when apparently it's fine everywhere else she goes - don't ask me though, I'm no expert on this stuff. She also told us kitchen is closing in 10 minutes so is we wanted to order food we'd have to be quick, which was totally fine. Then she left us and didn't come back for another 10 minutes after warning us to order quickly. Luckily we got our orders in.  Long story short, the place was OKAY. The food was good, came quickly (mostly because we were one of 2 tables in the whole place) and service was not bad but could brush up on their customer service."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and I was excited to check out the wychwood pub as it was just around the corner from me and could have been my new regular spot. Unfortunately it was such a disappointing outing I don't think I will ever go back. When we walked in there was one guy at the bar so very quiet. We grabbed a table and I'm not big on beer so I grabbed a drink menu. I ordered a margarita and the waitress (who seemed totally sweet) looked worried and said I'm not sure if she (being the bartender) can make it. I was confused as I ordered off the menu that I was given. When the waitress came back to the table she said that they didn't have a blender so they couldn't make it. I said that was fine I actually wanted it over ice not blended. Then she said well we only have bar lime. The price of the drinks were already kind of high and the fact that they didn't want to help basically the only customers that they had in the bar caused us to leave. I heard that this place was on restaurant makeover already, but It doesn't seem like they learned much from that experience."}
{"text":"Formerly Legends Bar & Grill, Wychwood Pub seems to appeal to a younger and more diverse crowd but their offerings are the same (the menu still reads Legends) and the quality remains low. The decor has improved a lot but some areas still need work (like the stained carpeted stairs and the below average bathrooms).  Let's start with the beers: Coors, Coors Lite, Bud Lite, Molson something, Rickards Red, Keiths, and ok, Creemore.....you get the picture. But how can a bar today have that selection of beer on tap? It just can't happen anymore! Where are the micro brews? Where are the local beers?  Then there's the food: there's been no upgrade in the quality of food since the Legends days. On the menu you will find \"New York Wings\" - what are those?! Well I had them and they are not good. Not even pub-level quality! Fries were soggy and flavourless. Steer clear of the food at all costs. Speaking of costs, it is expensive to dine at Wychwood Pub. 2 ciders will set you back $16 and a fries add-on to your sandwich is $3.99 for just a handful of \"freshly cut chips\" - which they are most certainly NOT!   Finally, a group of us came here on Trivia Tuesdays with the hope that it would be comparable to the trivia night at Dave's down the block (which is fantastic, by the way) but we were sorely disappointed. The bar was loud and filled with people who weren't playing so we couldn't hear any of the questions (host needs a mike). The organization of the game is confusing. The sheets aren't properly numbered and the instructions aren't clear - whose turn is it to answer? Which team gets to go first and why? How many points? Bottom line: we quickly lost interest.  It's really a shame because a quality but casual hang-out spot is exactly what this neighbourhood needs. It's a cash cow for the owners. Look around at the condos! Cater to the market! There's still time. Please improve. It could be so great!"}
{"text":"The place is a lil better inside, grey and plain compared before. There's a bar tender and just one waitress doing all the work. She's friendly and helpful.  The food is just not that good except for their fresh cut fries! We ordered their Burgers (Wychwood, Veggie, & Lamb) they are all uhhmm...meeeh! Drinks are somewhat expensive and A pitcher of beer is $22!"}
{"text":"Thankfully, I read the yelp reviews after my dad and I decided to dine here. I had attempted to dine at this establishment in the past but after being ignored by all staff for 10 minutes, I decided to take my business elsewhere.  Today though, we had a much more positive experience. We disagreed with many of the comments left by my fellow yelpers so they've either improved in quality or we came on a good night.  Service was on the sluggish side at first but once we ordered, we found the servers prompt and attentive. My dad had a Guiness beer that was palatable and you could draw in the foam indicating it was the authentic drink. I must admit that the craft beer that they were advertising was getting quite a bit of attention so it must have been meeting customers expectations as the table next to us had ordered two-three rounds of it.  The food was very tasty. i had the chicken caesar wrap and found the chicken cooked perfectly and the ceasar dressing was spot on. I don't normally feel like fries but as they accompanied the wrap, I decided to go with it. They were delicious and seemed fresh (as opposed to frozen). Mildly spiced it was my favorite part of the meal.  My dad who normally polishes off what's on his plate actually brought about half of his dinner home because he was full. However, he said the meal was really delicious.  This place is not for intimate gatherings (though we did observe a few lovebirds on dates), the noise level is above average.  Price point is very reasonable. The total cost for our dinner was lower than normal and considering we both brought part of our meal home that's pretty impressive.  Will we return? Maybe! Would I recommend this place for an after work drink? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Pros:  Good location. Classic neighborhood pub. Always a place to sit, open late. Food is average pub food, service is ok, good selection of draft beers.   Cons:  rarely show TFC games,  Bar table/seating design could be better"}
{"text":"I was here with the guys this week. The food was not impressive. My burger was over-salted and really dried out and flavourless, the bun was a little stale, and toppings an afterthought. The fries were fine. Beer was fairly cheap though, $5.50 for a pint of Wellington.  The room is fairly brightly lit and austere. Service was  abrupt. All things considered, potentially a place to grab a beer just because there's not much else around in the neighbourhood, but not much more than that."}
{"text":"I am at this place every week and to be honest have not had the experience most people have listed in their reviews. Tried their burger last week and it was average. Definitely not a place to go eat! Drinks are moderately priced and the sofa seats near the window are amazing. I guess I like not more than other people because it's soo near my home!"}
