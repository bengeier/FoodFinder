{"text":"I went there about 3 in the afternoon on a Tuesday because I had a yen for pho. The service was perfunctory but sufficient. The ambiance was \"commercial Vietnamese\"; not funky in any way shape or form. The restaurant was reasonably clean. I had the Special Beef Noodle. It came in a big bowl with the mint leaves, fresh bean sprouts, fresh lime all on the side; the hot sauce was already on the table. Heaven! Too much weird beef things in it for me though; I should have stuck with the Rare Beef pho - but that's my fault not theirs."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fast and quite filling too. I was expecting less and I over ordered.  I will take friend here in the future."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed with this place.  I don't expect decor to be fancy in a Vietnamese Restaurant, but this place really, really needed some tidying up.  I always order salad rolls and the ones I got here were very sloppy and fell apart in my hands.  My daughter ordered a beef Pho and she said it wasn't that great either. Too bad."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food fast, we order pick up a lot and its always ready quick. When they first opened there was some mistakes with the orders but that has been improved and the food is always fresh! Subs are good and Pho is excellent."}
{"text":"Ok Vietnamese food for the price, sate Pho was average, the pork vermicelli was ok, worst BBQ pork sub I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss.  I have been there 3 times.  Once was WOW, once was meh, and once was so-so.  I think there are better Vietnamese places around...even in the NW.  I can think of 3 better than this, just off the top of my head.  This is mediocre.  John Gilcrest has given it a fairly positive review.   I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"There's not too many options for vietnamese in the NW so I am appreciative to have this to choose from. The staff has been very friendly and helpful. It's comfortable inside as they have booths and high ceilings."}
{"text":"Grilled pork or chicken is always good. Very huge portions (4 slices) in one order. Quick service although not as courteous which is typical for Asian Restaurants. Pho is decent with options for small, larger and extra large serving. Wife and I have been coming back and forth in this resto since we discovered it in 2015."}
{"text":"I'm going to knock one star off for inconsistency. Ordered an avocado shake today (we always get these) and it was like 5% avocado and the rest milk and ice. Returned it and received a better avocado shake, but the waitress was sort of surly and just waved us to the counter so someone else could \"deal with it\". Also, their prices went up by a buck all across the board. Shake portion went down as well."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 stars for their Sate peanut pho...I was addicted to it and am now in withdrawals since this place closed. Unfortunately, the new owners did a great job on renovating the place but did not keep the recipes the same as they used to be. If anyone knows where the old owners went and if they are still in business elsewhere, please message me."}
{"text":"So firstly this location has been moved from 16th ave to Creekside plaza in the NW. I live up the street so was ecstatic that a Bhan mi / pho / vermicelli placed opened up within walking distance. Tried the sub for the first time today and its one of those things that after you eat it you think why didnt i just have a PB & J sandwich instead. You cant really screw up a sub can you?? This one was cold the meat tasted like fish and all the veggies the yummy veggies, cucumber, carrots and even the hot peppers looked and tasted old?! Not giving it one star cause I want to believe the Pho is better. Owners seem really nice and I like to support the local business's. Good luck next time Vietnam Palace."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. Was given the wrong food, upon arriving home order was wrong, called and was told I could \"exchange\" my order. Drove all the way back and was asked to pay the $3 difference. Food was mediocre at best. Saigon Red Sky is just down the road and much better. Should have made the short drive."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally have more pho restaurant options in the NW. When I tried this place out, I was initially turned off by the prices. Their dishes average from $9.50 - $12.50 a bowl. Their Vietnamese subs are a whooping $7.50 - $8.00!!! I might as well drive to the NE and pay for better tasting subs for $5.  When the food came out, I was even more disappointed. I ordered their Bo Kho and my eating companions ordered a variety of pho dishes. It was all bland. I had to add more fish sauce for flavouring but even then it wasn't satisfactory.   It's a shame to say that I will not be returning due to their prices. If they were to lower their prices, I would consider coming back to try out their subs (especially when subs are hard to screw up to begin with). I truly wanted it to work out since I only live 5 mins away. :("}
{"text":"I didn't like them when they were on 16 Ave, but since they've moved to Creekside I decided to give them another chance... nope.  Last night, my family and I came here to satiate some Vietnamese cravings.  You know, the food wasn't all bad, but the service was pretty poor.  Here's some examples...  1. I ordered the grilled beef salad roll (4 pcs) and asked if I can mix and match since you have the choice of getting it with pork and chicken as well.  They're all the same price, 2 for $4.99 or 4 for $8.99 but after two minutes of going back and forth with the server she just couldn't understand what I was trying to do so my husband said just forget it.  Then finally she  understood, but said can't mix and match with beef because it's more expensive.  What?   2. Server was confirming our order and I said yes, beef salad rolls.  Her: beef rolls? Not plain salad rolls? Yes, beef salad rolls - what your menu says! Not salad rolls? Dude, you guys named it beef salad rolls, not me.  I just want to make sure I ordered the right thing...  3. Said order of grilled beef salad rolls came out as chicken...  4. I ordered a wor wonton soup with seafood and veggies and the wontons were completely omitted.  They realized and brought it over minutes after.  5. You should always ask if the patrons are done with their bowl/plates before taking them away.  I turned my head away for two seconds and a different server grabbed my daughter's bowl with visible food left in it.  I had to grab it back from her.  Honestly was not impressed.  The food is more expensive than your average Vietnamese restaurant and the service was so disorganized and poor.  I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times as of writing of this review.  The restaurant is located in the Creekside Shopping Centre between Evanston and Kincora.  As such, there is plenty of parking in the vicinity of the restaurant.  The restaurant is large with a high ceiling so noise level is never too overwhelming.  The decor is a bit iffy but quite honestly, nobody ever go to eat Vietnamese food for its decor.  As commented by other reviewers, prices are high compared to the ghetto areas in the City's NE and SE but they are in line with other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.  You are not gonna find $6.50 for bowl of pho in this part of the City.  The food itself is nothing special but again in line with other Vietnamese restaurants that I have experienced in the area.  Overall, the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I was a regular when this place was on 16 Ave and 2 St. NW. The place is more upscale than their last digs and you can see the cooks working the grill behind the glass case toward the back of the restaurant. The flavours haven't changed. Their grilled meats are well seasoned and tasty. The portions are as large as they used to be. The bowls the Nuoc cham comes in when served with Bún are much larger so I would be careful on how much you pour over your Bún. I like just enough to coat everything with a little bit extra but not so that the sauce is like a soup. I had the Short ribs with Spring rolls Bún.The one thing I found was that the short ribs could have been cooked a little more, they were cooked but could have done with more browning. The flavour is still as good as it used to be. Service was pleasant and good. The music is subtle and does not blare overhead like it used to in the old place. Like most Vietnamese places there are dishes I prefer here and go to other places for certain things. All in all I would go back there if it wasn't so out of the way for me."}
{"text":"This a regular haunt of mine for Vietnamese Bun and occasionally Pho. The specialty of this place is grilled meats and that is why I tend to stick to Bun when I come here. Most Bun & Pho run from $8.99 to $10.99. They offer a very good deal on soups if 2 are ordered, the 3rd one is free but only for dine-in. The XL for Pho is XL, think soup size at a chinese banquet that would serve 10 people so I tend to order either M or L, there is no S. I wouldn't say that this is the best place for Pho or Bun but it's consistent and fairly good, portions tend to be generous and service and food delivery quick. They also have lunch deals for Subs which include an appetizer and pop for under $12."}
{"text":"I love this place. The servers are friendly, the environment is clean and open, and the menu has a lot of variety. Good pho! Just what Creekside needed. Prices are a little higher than other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has moved as I notice someone else had stated to the nw creekside. I was so excited as I used to go to the 16th Ave location often and always had a great meal. Ordered the sate beef vermicelli bowl and some spring rolls for take out. IT WAS THE WORST VIETNAMESE FOOD IVE EVER HAD!!!  The sate beef had this thick tasteless gravy on it that had a chalky corn starch texture to it... And the Noodles were overcooked and mush. If I could I would give this place 0 stars! It was truly that bad. I would have taken it back but didn't want to go through the hassle of driving back to complain..I ended up throwing it in the garbage. So take my advice and SAVE YOUR MONEY! (I noticed too the prices are quite higher)"}
{"text":"Good quality and decently priced Vietnamese food tends to get harder to find when you get into the deep burbs of Calgary. Unfortunately Vietnam Palace delivers only one.   The restaurant is tucked away in the Creekside mall near the Co Op. The upholstery throws you back to bad decorating decisions of 1995. Their decorator must've thought floral seat covers and curtains would make a huge comeback.... Lol  Despite its charming coverings, the food here is actually pretty delicious and plentiful. The broth is very rich in beefy and spicy goodness and I leave full every time. However, I can't justify $12-14 a bowl if I can get an equally good bowl of noodles off center street for $8.99, which I don't live too far from.   They have a buy 2 get 1 free deal, but after doing the math, it still costs you more to eat here than at most other Vietnamese restaurants.   I think if you're in the area and don't want to venture too far for a good bowl of pho but want to remember what your mom's old couch used to look like, Vietnam Palace does the trick but you just have to be prepared to the 30% convenience fee."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area, I was pleased to see a Vietnamese restaurant so close, as I really enjoy Pho.  The wait staff are polite and friendly, the location is clean, but unfortunately that is where the good stops. I ordered a bowl of Pho (which was more expensive than the Pho I have ordered at other similar restaurants). And sadly, I was disappointed. The Pho was very bland. I added hot sauce and soy sauce to try to liven it up, and it still failed to make it taste right. It really is too bad. I'll be driving further for the better tasting cuisine in future."}
{"text":"The menu is fairly large.  They even have Vietnamese subs! They have a deal for pho that's buy 2 get a 3rd for free (Only at specific times) - good value I suppose.   The subs, and stay pho are pretty good.   Decor ... meh. haha. think pink, and green, with large prints of foggy mountain/tropical scenes, sheets of glass over table cloths on the tables..... y'know... don't come for the ambiance  hahaha."}
{"text":"We eat here very frequently out of convenience because they are located within walking distance to our home.  All the sauces that you apply yourself (sriracha, hoisin, fish sauce, etc) are watered down.  The shakes leave a little to be desired.  The soups are always great and we've eaten them here many many times.  Take out soup is provided with the meat in the broth and the noodles and vegetables separate.  When ordering take-out soup there is no large bowl provided to eat the soup with so make sure you have your own at home.  The shrimp salad rolls are small and expensive for what you get.  The dry vermicelli dishes are average quality.  Don't order the Thai food, it's not very good.  Service is quick like all Vietnamese restaurants.  The basil leaves are always very fresh.  They're fresh enough that we got one of their leaves to grow at home and now it's a little plant :).  If you're looking for good Vietnamese soup I recommend this place.  If you like dry vermicelli bowls then it's not bad.  We haven't eaten the entrées (pork chops, etc) because we can cook that stuff at home easily.  Parking gets pretty full at night and be careful about parking on the street because there are tow-away zones and some areas of the street don't allow parking during the day.  They have a $15 minimum for debit & credit card which is annoying (and probably against their merchant agreement with their machine provider)."}
{"text":"Vietnam palace is my new go to for pho. I have tried many different places and this is by far the best. Portion size is just perfect. Normally every pho place I go to puts so many noodles even when I specify less noodles. A lot of the time I can't finish it because the portions are big so I specify less to reduce any waste. Vietnam palace is the first place to get the right amount! Pricing and location are a plus. It is conviently located off of Stoney trail in NW."}
{"text":"I've only had their Vietnamese subs so I can only comment on that.  Their subs are among the cheapest in town and if you order for take-out it comes with a free can of pop.  $6 for a sub and pop is a great value (rare nowadays in Calgary).  Dining area is clean and staff/owners are friendly.  Whenever I wait for my to-go order they offer me something to drink and allow me to sit down.  It would get 5-stars if the dining room decorations were a little less tacky."}
{"text":"\"Fulfilling\" was the word my sister used to describe the hot pot special we had at lunch today.  Right now, Vietnam Palace has a hot pot / hot plate special for $19.99/person - buy for 2 persons, the 3rd is free.  The special is on till February 10, 2010.  What a deal!  Unlimited appetizers of spring rolls, salad rolls, pan fried dumplings and deep-fried chicken wings.  You order the hot spot special off a list like a sushi list - what do you want to eat - beef, shrimp is extra $3.00 per person, suey choy (vege), onions, tofu, carrots, bean sprouts, noodles and rice.  Choose the soup you want - satay, tom yum or sukiyaki.    We had the sukiyaki soup base - just a nice clear broth.  Didn't feel like hot and spicy today.  The beef we ordered was nicely sliced and it's AAA beef sirloin and quite lean.  We threw in the onions, carrots and the stems of the suey choy first to get it going as it takes longer to cook.  Once the soup boils, the beef goes in and it takes seconds to cook the beef.  Don't overcook it or it will taste like tough leather!  Dunk your beef etc into the peanut sauce they give you.  It's so good!     The best part of it all is at the end when the beef has all been cooked and the beef broth is just so tasty.  Every drop of our soup was drunk.    We came away very, very fulfilled as my sister says."}
{"text":"I noticed this place opened up recently after a shopping trip to the Co-op in the same plaza.    I stopped in after work hoping that it would be a great new addition to the food options currently available in Northern Hills area.  ANOTHER pho place is NOT what we need but I do love a good bowl of pho and yesterdays impromptu mini snow storm was a good opportunity to check out the offerings.  First thing is I know this place used to be on 16th ave at some point and there were mixed reviews; browsing the menu online, there were several options, albeit more pricey than other places.  I don't know what this restaurant wants to be, a Chinese restaurant? Thai? Vietnamese?  There are so many offerings from these regions I can only assume that they would be mediocre.  Beyond my better judgement pulled up and went in.  As others have mentioned in their reviews of the former location and the decor- I can only assume they brought with them said tacky decor...when I say tacky, think Kim Kardashian and her floral get up when she was pregnant.  Yes. Upholstered like this in every booth and chair.  Everywhere.   The restaurant itself is huge, but there were only 2 tables of five or six people in total in the entire restaurant and it was supper time, big red flag.  Beyond that, I could not get over the stench when you walk in.  Having children who play hockey, I can only describe it as someone who vomited inside stinky hockey gloves wrapped up in a jock strap. The stench lingered in my nasal cavity well after I left.  So not even being able to try the food, even with the deals listed due to the atrocious stench warrants a 1 star from me."}
