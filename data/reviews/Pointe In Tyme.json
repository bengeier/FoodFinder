{"text":"Keeping in mind the number of bad Yelp reviews, I was not going to visit this place. But there are not too many other options around, so I decided to take my chances.

It worked out very well: pan-fried sea bass was excellent! The service was fast, the place was very cozy. And not very expensive, too.

PS:

Chili-rubbed Iron Steak room service brought me a day earlier (I guess they deliver from Pointe In Tyme) was not very good."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Our waiter took 25 minutes to greet us and the busser apologized 3 times.  The busser was great but you could tell very frustrated.  I tipped the bus boy $20 just to make a point to the waiter and manger that the bus boy needs to replace the waiter.  Steak fries came and were uncooked.  Kathy the manager was very nice as well and could tell I was disappointed in the place.  Spend the extra money and eat at the restaurant up top of the resort.  The only reason we came here was because we were with kids and thought this would be more appropriate."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends and sat in the lounge.  Our server was friendly and accommodating and service was timely.  I started off ordering the Butcher's Plate or something like that.  It was supposed to be a board of various cheeses, meats, crostini, olives - that sort of thing.  Didn't really care for it...for $15 bucks, it was a lot of meat and 3 tiny triangles of white cheddar cheese and it was not even that good.

We stayed quite a while, had more drinks, ordered more food.  Ended up getting a bunch of stuff to split and share.  Had the mac and cheese, BBQ sliders, beet salad and tomato soup.  All were alright...."}
{"text":"I went here after a late flight from Denver, as it was the only restaurant at our hotel that was really open, and we did not want snacky food. Let's just say the food was definitely lacking. I ordered a burger and it pretty much tasted like a hockey puck it was so burnt. Maybe try it Medium instead of Medium well next time? Scratch that I probably wont be going back next time I am in Phoenix, The service was OK but I have experienced better. I would not recommend this place, but if it is the absolute only place and someone else was paying I would not pass it up."}
{"text":"Better to venture off property than have dinner here. It's expensive and our meal was completely forgettable. The kids had burgers which were basic. I had scallops and fettuccine which was uneven. Scallops were cooked to perfection and were really enjoyable. The pasta was seriously undercooked.  The pork shank with fig reduction was overcooked, dry and chewy and way too sweet."}
{"text":"Very good bacon cheeseburgers (I'm aware of the low bar to meet to make bacon cheeseburgers good. These were flawless.), great risotto, excellent service (particularly in understanding and taking seriously dietary restrictions)."}
{"text":"Service here is the worst I have received. Our server Sherri took my Invisalign trays which were in a bowl (twice) and the second time she came back and just said that they were not in the trash, without one word of apology. She just left and I felt like she did not care at all. I complained at the hostess desk and the were unable to find the manager on duty, Jeff. After 15 minutes they finally found someone who was able to take off the automatic 18% gratuity off the bill for breakfast. He muttered an apology that he didn't mean at all (with a disgruntled face) and I left the restaurant feeling horrible and angry about the service. We came because our hotel stay included a free breakfast but we would never come here to pay for an actual meal."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years, loved the food and the ambience...until tonight. This was suppose to be a special night out for our daughter before she headed off to college. We decided to sit in the bar area..bad idea if you want to be served food quickly. We ordered our dinner at 6:00....at 6:35 our waitress came by to apologize for how long it was taking...apparently there was a private party with 60 people in the area next to us and the food was taking a while. That was a little hard to believe as there was a family of 5 sitting in the restaurant area who got bread and were served long before us...and we didn't get any bread. Our food finally arrived at 6:45. My daughter and I ordered the salmon, my husband-the steak. The salmon was supposed to have a citrus marinade..no citrus flavor was to be found, and it was very dry. My husband's steak was so over done and dry, he didn't even want to bring the leftover home to our dog. We expressed our disappointment to the waitress-who was very nice and apologized..she mentioned the chef is new and we are not the first people to complain about the food. We did get a small discount for the meal, but unfortunately, will not be back."}
{"text":"Meh, for sure. Since we were staying at the hotel we thought we'd pop over for a drink and light app. What a weird space! Here we are, in the middle of a desert with gorgeous views, land, and sky to see, and this dungeon is what we have available to us.

Service was fine. The bartendress was nice. The food selection sucked, and our cheese platter was sub-par. What a waste of space."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! Food abc service great!!!best place in town!!! Seriously good and accommodating!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast every morning because it was so convenient! The food was much better than any breakfast buffet I've ever eaten at. We had a server named Sandi and she was AMAZING! She would find out any and everything we needed to do or see at the resort and even went so far as to give us multiple options in Sedona as well! She definitely made our meals much better. Thanks so much Sandi!"}
{"text":"Dinner we was great, chicken and pork chops where top notch. Had breakfast buffet for a few days in a row and it was constantly good each day."}
{"text":"I think I stepped into a time machine and ended up back in the 1960's... 

This place reminds me of an old steak house from the 1960's... dark wood panel walls, semicircle cushy booths lining the walls, leaded glass windows and doors, wait staff wearing jackets.... all they're missing are women wearing A-line ankle-length dresses and pearls!
Oh wait.... I think I spoke too soon...

The food... uh... well, it is a hotel restaurant.  Translation: expensive and can be disappointing.  We visited on 2011-05-21 for dinner during restaurant week in Phoenix.  The special was one appetizer, an entree, dessert, and a glass of house wine for a fixed price.  As far as appetizers go, the calamari was good - lightly battered, warm, fresh.  The shrimp skewers were very disappointing; 3 shrimps standing up like feathers mounted on cubes of cucumbers.  Looked good.... until you realize that it is cold (looks hot), overcooked, and it's literally just 3 shrimps on this huge plate.  Not a good start.... but the glass of wine helps dull the senses...
The entree - we went for the steaks and fillet mignon.  Both were good size portions, properly cooked, but nothing special to write home about.  I've had better at other places in town.  I have to say the fillet mignon was nicely done; without it, I'd have dropped to 2 stars.  
Dessert -  we went for the lava chocolate cake.  Warm chocolate center flows out when you cut into the cake... it made up my shrimp appetizer.  

Overall, I have mixed feelings about the experience.  Food had some good points and some bad points, but the price point - if not for the restaurant week special deal, it would have been a letdown.  The ambiance is cold and dark - I think someone else mentioned dungeon?  This is a fancy dungeon from the past... how do I get back to the future?"}
{"text":"Took family there for early Christmas dinner. Met by rude hostess who argued over 7 versus 6 on reservation in a restaurant that was empty except 1 other large party. Waiter was very sweet but not trained evidenced by spilling wine when pouring, didn't deliver bread until we ask after about 20 minutes and then brought bread but no plates. Kitchen out of Salmon but found out after several of us had ordered. At that point sought out manager to beg for some oversight so our evening could get salvaged and that never happened. After 1 1/2 hours finally got our meals. Pork chops were beautiful but due to thick cut and being underdone needed steak knives that we had to ask for.  We are typically ones to complain. The meal was very expensive just nothing went right. Will never go back"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it no stars. I had lunch there, and the service was terrible. I don't think I ever got a refill on my drink. Also, I went with 6 people and not one person liked their overprice food. The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor, the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place. Skip it, even if you have a free voucher from the hotel."}
{"text":"While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable."}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere! That was until someone walked up to the table and placed a brochure about fat weight loss on our table right in front of us. Not sure if they have this service at the hotel or what."}
{"text":"Pointe in Tyme is a very attractive large restaurant set in one of Phoenix's many fine resort hotels. My wife and I had dinner there on a Saturday evening at approximately 6 PM. We were promptly greeted and seated at a large banquette. We did note that the restaurant was quite full. A very friendly waitress arrived promptly and took our order for our appetizer and a drink. She complimented us on our choice of calamari and said it was one of the chef's specialties. 
The calamari arrived after a ten minute wait but we rejected it as it was tough and chewy. When we rejected it, the waitress asked if we would like to try something else and relied upon our memory of what was on the menu rather than telling or showing the menu. We selected the eggplant caponata bruschetta. Meanwhile I waited on my beverage. After another five minutes the waitress came back and said that the bar was out of Bacardi and had to go the storeroom to get some. After another ten minutes, the drink arrived, a rum and coke, with no garnishment such as lime or lemon.
After a total wait of fifteen minutes, or so, the eggplant caponata bruschetta arrived. It did appear to us as since this was a replacement order, it could have been served with a little more dispatch. The order was very good, if different, with golden raisins in the caponata which made it a little oversweet. While we were enjoying the bruschetta, the entrees arrived. Rather than returning the entrees to the kitchen to await our readiness, the entrees were dropped off at the far end of the table.(It should be noted at this time, the restaurant was staffed with wait staff, servers, a water person, and bus people, and others, moving around the dining area with great dispatch.)When we were done with the bruschetta, we had to clear the serving plate and appetizer dining plates and relocate entrees to our end of the table.
My wife had ordered the Chipotle Brown Sugar Short Ribs and I ordered the Sea Scallops. According to our waitress, the short ribs had been marinated for 48 hours and were indeed soft and tender and did not really need a knife to manage. It came with whole glazed carrots and a little horseradish mashed potatoes. My wife did enjoy all except for the carrots. The sea scallops were served with a basmatti rice and, again, a little dab of spinach. Four large scallops along with the accompaniments were served in a huge bowl with a wide two to three inch rim and appeared to be lost in the serving. The preparation and taste was excellent.
We finished our meal sharing a deep dish caramel apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and coffee. The ice cream and apples were excellent but I did think the dough was slightly undercooked and I am still trying to figure out what makes a pie \"deep dish.\" Certainly not the plate on which it was served. The coffee was excellent.
We went to the restaurant thanks to a TravelZoo offer of $60 for $30. Our total bill including tip came to $32 (including one alcoholic drink) plus the $30 prepayment. Our (self-calculated) tip was based on the gross amount of the bill (before the credit). Our final analysis - okay but definitely not great. Not sure if the coupon affected our service. When we arrived, the staff asked if this was a special occasion and my wife replied that it was my birthday. No special action was taken by the staff."}
{"text":"Service was good and the decor was nice but I was pretty disappointed in the food and the pricing. Seemed quite expensive for what you got and the breakfast in particular felt lackluster for a premium resort."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars is my rating for this Restaurant.
Was staying at the resort for a coference and choices of where to eat were limited so I assumed this restaurant would be top noch as it was one of the only restaurant opens on the resort.
No so my fellow yelpers, not so.
The staff (particularlly the waitress) was amazing! She deserves 5 stars.
The food was just okay, felt like I have gotten everything better else where.
The salmon was okay, a little over cooked and the buger was just okay. 
I have nothing more constructive to add then JUST OK."}
{"text":"Worst place ever !!! Sat down for two minutes and walked right out!!! Dirty and there is no view !!! Made reservations for a romantic dinner and was placed by a bare salad bar with dirty dishes ... Turn away DO NOT G0 here!!!! Worst place ever!!! Hostess was so unprofessional .. One guy was waiting two hours and didn't even put his order in ..."}
{"text":"We are here once for dinner and then the next day for breakfast since we did a mini stay-cation at the Hilton with 18 holes at the lookout golf club.

Dinner: 3 stars
We were seated for about 10 minutes before a bus-girl came to give us water and asked if we wanted bread.  We placed our drink and food order together- he got a draft  xx lager and the burger w fries.  I ordered the short ribs but they were sold out at the time (8:15).  I got the market salad instead since the menu was so limited.  Our server Colleen offered to have them add a salmon filet which I did.  I also had a glass of lost angel wine, I think a cab or Pinot?  The wine was good but I would have gotten a white wine with the buttery flavor of the salmon in retrospect.  My hunny got his burger medium well instead of medium though The patty did not seem hand pressed, so NOT amazing.  My salmon salad was good, generous with spinach, baby green beans, fontina, tomatoes, and the salmon atop was cooked nicely and had a crispy outer which was yummy!  We had the carrot cake which was ok- wish the sides had frosting!  The flavor was not too sweet and definitely homemade.  My hunny did not like the crunchy bits on top though I was fine with it.

Breakfast: 5 stars
We were seated one booth over from the night before.  We were greeted quickly by a super nice gal and she explained the buffet to us. My got the breakfast burrito and I did the buffet.  I got a plate of pineapple, honeydew, strawberries, made a Greek yogurt parfait with almonds and walnuts, and grabbed a muffin and croissant.  The pastries were delicious! His burrito was huge and presented really nicely with yummy garlic potatoes, 2 salsas, a grilled tomato and a baby asparagus.  

It seems as if they may have been understaffed for dinner though breakfast was better.

Overall I rate the restaurant at 4 stars based on our 2 experiences."}
{"text":"This review would have been a one except my partners food was better then mine.

We were staying at the Hilton property that this is connected to. Because of this we had breakfast vouchers. Being frequent travelers we usually ignore the hotel breakfast and breakfast vouchers. I've been burnt to many times I should have known better then trying this place.

Our waitress was extreemly obtrusive. I could care less that our vouchers were equivlient to $13.72 worth of credit off the menu or allowed us to get the breakfast buffet, whether or not the orange juice or coffee was included and the in's and outs of all their rules. Fine, you can tell me one time, just tone it DOWN. I really dont care I just want to eat breakfast, not listen to the interworkings of how Point In Tyme runs their books. I didn't get all this told to me once, I was told no less the 5 times in our dining experience. 

My qualm is I ordered a smoked salmon bagel. Now.... my family and I over the years have come up with our top ten rules for restauraunts. Number one has always been that the customer should be informed of what is not available when they receive the menu. That is acceptable. As a server take a little bit of pride, there is NOTHING wrong with telling the customer what is not on the menu. It's not that hard see look here is the script, \"Welcome to Point In Tyme my name is Bridgett. Our special today is the Breakfast Buffet and we are out of the smoked salmon.\" That is not how my experiece went. We ordered, I of course ordered the smoked salmon bagel, 10 minutes pass and I here two servers in the background. 
     ~ \"I know we are usually out of the smoked salmon\"
     - \"Yea, I wasn't sure, so I put in the order\"
OKAY.... I heared that... so of course, \"Sir, we are out of the smoked salmon is there anything else I can get for you.\" At this point I wrote this place of, not only did you break a major rule by not telling me you were out, you believed your were out, and put in the order anyways.

Okay enough smoked salmon. My rule number two is dont make people wait on the check. We weren't going to order desert at breakfast. You finally brought our food, refill our coffee and bring us the check! There is NO reason we should be waving our hands in the air flagging down everybody and their mother for a freaking check after sitting there for 20 minutes after eating..."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  

Short order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.  They were just warm. This place needs to do a better job!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here...pretty good food. Kids ate free with adult meal or buffet purchase. Kind of pricey otherwise. Good service and able to accommodate large groups!"}
{"text":"We came here for their Easter buffet and it was delicious. All the food was good, a rarity for a buffet, usually they're hit or miss. The ham with apple compote was soo good, and their grilled veggies were so flavorful....I'm drooling thinking about it. This place is far for me, but I will be back for another buffet, its worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Rick is the best bartender in AZ!  Food is delicious and the restaurant has great ambience.  Entry says Breakfast and Brunch, but I recommend dinner..."}
{"text":"Pointe in Tyme's Restaurant Week menu is what brought me in this spring. With the option of choosing any appetizer, entree, dessert AND an accompanying glass of wine--my girlfriends and I couldn't say no. 

I started with the mac and cheese. It was a generous size and served alongside grilled wild boar sausage. I chose the Florentine Ravioli for my main course. I really enjoyed this dish, especially the braised short rib and arugula on top. Definitely a good sized meal for one person--I ended up taking mine home for lunch the next day. For dessert I chose the flourless chocolate cake. This was probably my least favorite part of the meal, but that could possibly be because my friends ordered the creme brulee and carrot cake so I instantly had buyers remorse when I ordered my mine. It was a small portion, but packed an incredibly chocolate-y punch. 

Our server was friendly and helpful, giving us her personal favorites as recommendations. The ambiance was quiet, and the decor was a little vanilla--but overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Dinner on Christmas Day means hotels.  They're the only ones, generally open, except for a few chains.  I was at Pointe Squaw Peak.  They were offering a couple of buffets at their restaurants.  The Pointe at Tapatio was also offering a couple of buffets.  I went with Point in Tyme because I liked the menu better.  I'm not a huge fan of buffets.  I was nicely surprised with this one.  The food was very good (not what I was expecting).  Some good beer choices and excellent service.  It made for an enjoyable Christmas Day."}
{"text":"New years eve dinner with the family. 
Had chefs special,  48.00 per person.
We had one of each;

Starters
Grilled artichoke - was ok
Crab salad - better

Main course; 
Rib rye steak cooked well on one side, med on the other, I wanted rare.
Sea bass good but dry.

Desserts;
Chocolate cake dry
Creme brulee, in a pastry shell, boo..

Went to rest room, to find two older Hispanic ladies cleaning the men's room.  No sign, one lady holding door shut,  other cleaning.   When they came out said someone had vomited.   Noted they did not have proper equipment  or body fluid pick up supplies?   Omg.

I feel this average food and POOR employee procedure and protection is a reflection of the general managers, who should be fired.  Btw, where was the chef?"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better review because most of the staff is nice, but I just cannot lie to my fellow Yelpers. While Different Pointe of View, also on the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort property, blew me away, this left much to be desired.

We ate here twice. What can I say? You're on conference site and sometimes you just want to eat at the resort rather than venturing off via cab. Anyway, first night I ordered chicken with risotto. That wasn't risotto. More like stale rice (and it was cold). The chicken was ok. The second time I had pasta (penne) with marinara sauce. The pasta was like mush. 

It's dated and doesn't seem \"Phoenix\" at all to me. They should change their menu and their vibe. Just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night as part of our staycation before school starts.  Nothing really special as far as the food goes but the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Since this was one of the TWO restaurants (of about six) open when we stayed at the Pointe we inevitably ended up there one night. We ate bar food (fried this and fried that and cheesy something else) and had cocktails. The drinks were good and the food was edible. The bar area where we sat was quite nice with all the wood and the very large bar, and the service was decent.  The word \"meh\" was created for this place."}
{"text":"The moment you walk into the Pointe In Tyme, you feel cozy and comfortable. It's a refreshing assurance from the scorching heat of the Sonoran desert. 

I came in with my old man for Father's day during their breakfast bar, which is open from 7-11am and were satisfied by the appropriate number of selections they have. I thought the muffins were a bit greasy and overdone but the crepé was filling and the fruits were fresh. The omelette was made to order and exactly what I wanted and the bacon & sausages were satisfactory. 

Overall, my experience was good for the reasonable price of $16.95 per person and the service was spot on, our server kept the drinks coming and my coffee cup was always refilled. The design of the bar and dining hall reminded me of Torrey Pines Lodge up in Strawberry and the convenience of being near the Lookout Mountain Golf club was appealing but unfortunate that the heat wouldn't allow us to have a little tee time after brunch."}
{"text":"We live just up the street and have played golf many times at Lookout Mountain but this was our first time dining here.  We finished a round over the weekend and the guys were fervently suggesting that we go inside, two dollar pints they said, and great food discounts.
I normally don't patronize these restaurants as they are overpriced with mediocre food and iffy service.  But, the guys convinced us so we headed in.
Sadly, my thoughts were reinforced as the $2 draft was a 12 oz. Bud Light only.  Not a fan so I got a 20 oz. Blue Moon which was $10...The pub burger was overdone and supposedly topped with shaved Wagyu brisket which I had trouble distinguishing.
The waitress was nice enough I guess but seemed more interested in talking with the bartender than waiting tables.  We never got napkins or silverware, had to grab them ourselves from the bar."}
{"text":"While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, I've had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off. 

Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his \"wild mushroom\" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so \"wild\" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruth's Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much.

The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. I've had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubby's BLT breakfast bagel was better.

Come on, Hilton! Is this the best you can do?"}
{"text":"We went here for the breakfast buffet. The potatoes, broccoli and create your own omelette was good. I wish they had a tad more fresh options. They had baked goods there but they didn't taste fresh, they tasted stale which was disappointing. I would go back and try the menu side and see if maybe I liked the food better."}
{"text":"There is always great service . Location is easy to get to . We had their Italian buffet the pasta was aldente. The sausage was spicy And the  marinara sauce had a nice blend of flavors including plenty of garlic . We tried their beef sliders and their breakfast burritos which were hugh"}
{"text":"This is a nice quiet restaurant with a limited menu. Food was cooked well and the experience was relaxing and satisfying."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for Restaurant week.  I really like the location for the Restaurant and the atmosphere too. 

Now for the food, it was not all that great. First the appetizers were ok, my husband ordered the chili and it had no taste what so ever and he traded it for a salad.  When the salad came out it was drenched in salad dressing. :(  I ordered the Mac & Cheese and it was not that bad tasting.  Then the entrée's came out and I had the Filet and my husband had the Short Ribs.  The Filet was well worth the $30.00 for Restaurant week and the Short Ribs were very fatting.  

For the dessert, the Deep Dish Caramel Apple Pie and the carrot cake was amazing."}
{"text":"We've visited here many times - from the Sunday brunch, to dinner and drinks.  The interior makes you feel like you've walked right into a Harry Potter library, it's so cool!  The food here is really good - their soup choices are always wonderful.  It's fun to be there on the weekends with the golfers wandering in and out - and it being a two level facility means you can sit up at the bar and watch the comings and goings down below.  This is a definite must if you are looking for a place to meet someone for a drink afterwork or a nice weekend brunch.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My significant other wanted to try this restaurant and I was up for it. We made a reservation and I was happy to see we had a booth. 

I thought the interior was a bit dated and dark.  My bestie rather liked the dark English club room feel. 

 The poached pear bruschetta was amazing. The sweetness of the pear combined with the salty of prosciutto was delicious

I had the short rib roast and the other meal was the mustard grilled pork chop

The meat with the rib roast was okay but the grease that coated the vegetables was so heavy it gleaned in the darkness. This overwhelmed the meal. So many potatoes I was wishing that a green veggie was added

The pork chop was okay, but the vegetables were also co weed in grease

It was a special night so we splurged and has dessert.  The creme brûlée was not good.  The custard was dry and while the top had a hard crust it was not an even ...... sad

The better of the two desserts was the brownie. 

All in all I thought it was a very average meal"}
{"text":"Dined here for Easter Brunch. Big mistake. This place is dated. They need to shut it down and do a complete remodel and include new uniforms for the wait staff. Although my server Nancy was really sweet. I ended up with food poisoning. I think it was the seafood. I had the clams, mussels and crab legs. Overpriced and not worth the inflated price they charged for Easter. The best thing about the brunch was the omelette station.   Props to the omelette chef. She was great. Also enjoyed the chimichurri sauce with the lamb. But both those items will not cause me to back. This was the last Brunch I will ever attend there."}
{"text":"This place was great! Sad I only have 3 breakfasts to work my way through the menu. I got the \"eggs bennie\"- a twist on traditional eggs Benedict with savory bread pudding instead of English muffins...it messed with my head a little bit since I'm used to sweet bread pudding, but I love trying something different and this was definitely unique! My fiancé got the chili rellano, which was bomb. Tomorrow I think I'm gonna go red velvet pancakes...

The service was wonderful- we were seated quickly and had a lovely waitress who gave us giant waters to go so we could brave the Phoenix sun!"}
{"text":"Great service, but a bit spendy and mediocre food.

We ate here as our first dinner while in Phoenix and staying at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. The waitress was very friendly and helpful, but for 7 pm on Saturday night, the place was surprisingly deserted. We had a couple of cocktails, which weren't anything special, but were honestly what we expected. The calamari appetizer was tasty, and our dinners of grilled shrimp pasta and French onion soup were just OK; nothing great, but acceptable fare for a group of tired travellers.

The kids had chicken strips and fries, which brought no complaints, and they were happy to color on the kids menu while we waited. We could charge dinner to the room and they contacted the complimentary shuttle to take us back to our room.

Overall, our experience was pleasant, but ended up over $130 with an 18% tip for the friendly service, thus  the 3 stars for price and 'adequate' food."}
{"text":"Good waiter but horrible food. My trout was soggy sitting on top of soggy wild rice that appeared to have corn starch or some type of animal fat in it. Brussel sprouts were soggy also. My husband's steak (supposed to be medium rare) came out charred with some heavy sauce on it. We tried the creme brulee which was burnt on top and the berries were stuck on top. The bottom looked and tasted rotten like curd. I immediately felt sick after eating the creme brulee."}
{"text":"I truly don't understand the bad reviews for this place.  I almost didn't go during Restaurant Week because the reviews were so bad.  This is the one time I've been to a restaurant where the yelpers were way off base (of course with only 13 reviews as of when I write this, maybe this place doesn't get a lot of foot traffic).  I went with a group of friends here during Restaurant Week and we didn't regret it at all.  Yeah, the place is kind of a time warp with a very old school steakhouse feel, but the food and service both spoke volumes about this place.

The biggest thing that drew us here was that during restaurant week, they don't just give you a few choices amongst the different courses.  They let you select from their ENTIRE menu!  Huge points to management for that one.  For appetizers we each ordered something different.  I ordered the caprese salad (good mozzarella) and one of my friends got a crab fondue that was incredible.  For the main entree, I got the veal and sage ravioli.  Very fresh, artful presentation and generous portion.  And for dessert the chocolate volcano brownie was a perfect way to top off the meal.  As great as the food was, our server was awesome.  She was an elderly gal (can't remember her name), but she was warm, energetic, and very helpful with the menu.  Made the experience that much more enjoyable.

Again, don't really understand all the negative reviews I've seen thus far, and perhaps the restaurant had its A game just for restaurant week.  But the place was busy and it sure seemed like everyone enjoyed it as much as we did.  I pretty much went in with low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised with this place and how they took restaurant week to another level.  Still want to try Different Pointe of View on the other side of the resort at some point, but Pointe in Tyme was a smash hit with this foodie."}
{"text":"We ate here for Sunday brunch while staying at the resort and I was very impressed all the way around."}
{"text":"I am staying at the Tapatillo Cliffs Resort for the week and took my wife for dinner at the Pointe because we'd eaten here in the past and had decent meals.  In doing this I broke my own rule, which is to avoid hotel restaurants.  

I hate to say it but either the restaurant was having a bad night or has fallen significantly in quality over the past several years.  My beer was warmish, my wife's salad which looked good was missing a key ingredient promised on the menu, my entree (chicken & pasta) was bland at best, the service was poor, and even the dessert wasn't very good!

Given the number of good reviews, I'm guessing the main chef was off for the day but I'm still going to pass on returning to the restaurant for the rest of the trip.  Of course, in breaking my own rule, I guess I deserved what I got!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spread to fill your desire for a hearty start to the day. Our Wonderful waitress sent us on our way with coke and ice tea in to go cups...gratis. 

I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came here because the Point gave us vouchers for breakfast.
Very cool, old school looking restaurant, lots of wood. We had the breakfast buffet which was ok. Typical breakfast buffet, eggs, sausage, bacon, meats and cheeses. Omelette bar was there on Sunday, but not Monday. Staff was great.
Typical buffet food."}
{"text":"Good service. Beautiful interiors. Ate there for breakfast. Ordered the egg white scramble with gluten free bread. $14 and it was tiny and as good as any diner. All the ordered breakfasts at my table were tiny and just okay. Nice breakfast buffet though but Not worth the price in my opinion. Cool location though."}
{"text":"This place is good if you are staying at the resort and need a meal.  On its own it is not a destination to seek out.  That said if you are there and want breakfast get the Arizona Eggs. They are poached eggs with chorizo, black beans, cumin and other spices served on top of a fried native American flat bread.  They are heaven!!!"}
{"text":"The arugula, beets and strawberries of this salad w/tarragon vinaigrette were delicious. But I wish the side of grilled shrimp amounted to more than three shrimp. If you're even moderately hungry, this dish will not fill you up. (If I go back for this salad, I'd order the salad or chicken add-on instead.) To sate my appetite, after finishing the salad, I ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich to fill me up. That twosome was yummy ... If I'd gotten more shrimp, I would have rated this place a three or four. The wait staff is especially lovely."}
{"text":"Great calamari. Very nice servers. Squeezed in party of 16 with 20 minutes notice.

Went to Sunday brunch next. Wow. Everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We just had burgers. The meat was great and cooked perfectly. Service was friendly but quite slow."}
{"text":"It's a totally different experience than DPOV....totally different. 

This restaurant is like an old English library with some really fabulous eats. I think we have only enjoyed filet mignon here but I am telling you...it was really delicious. Of course, as is always the case with me, I enjoy starting each meal with a salad...and their Ceasar was delicious!

As Bil Z mentioned, their brunch is outstanding! We enjoyed it each day during our stay at Tapatio while trying something new each meal. This is a wonderful place to go out for a nice family meal while staying at the resort since there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The menu is very limited. My friend had the peach bruschetta. He was not very impressed although it was edible and unique. He found the concept intriguing but the result questionable. The menu just doesn't leave many options but they seem to be focused unique items. They even have charred octopus. I got the grilled cheese but got ham on mine and they were good about customizing it though they initially forgot the ham. I don't like grilled cheese on brioche bread. The roasted tomato and three bean soup was amazing! My friend even stole my soup because he loved it so much. The fries are perfect. Hot, thin, generously salted and crunchy. The mimosa has a bit of pulp in it so if you don't like pulp don't get it."}
{"text":"A decent steak in a location that is in dire need of an update.  Also, a nice and denser then average creme brulee."}
{"text":"We had purchased the Romance package at the resort which included in room breakfast or breakfast at this restaurant. We decided to walk to the restaurant and it was worth the time. We had the brunch and it was very good. The fruit and food selections were fresh and tasty! I live in the area and will be back for this brunch! Service was very good as well and the restaurant looked very clean to me."}
{"text":"We were a party of 14 on New Years Eve! We had a great time with no complaints. The service was impeccable! The food was excellent! Our party ordered from the NYE menu. I had the clam chowder, a porter house steak, and a lava brownie. The porter house steak was cooked to perfection!Everything tasted great! We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd year we have come to the Pointe In Tyme for Christmas Buffet. Let me mention how beautiful the decorations and displays are and the lit fireplace really sets the mood for our holiday dinner.
The Buffet was almost identical to previous year in nearly all ways including price at just under 50 a person. 
Just like the previous year, excellent service, great overall display, the cheese tray, main meal choices like the lamb were excellent, and nice grilled asparagus and broccolini, very good brussell sprouts , and port loin.
Deserts could probably be improved in quality as what was on display was a bit dry and unoriginal looking. Also, just like last year they offered Creme brulee on the advertising but unless you knew that and asked for it no one was going to tell you about it. I am a huge fan of creme brule, that is the whole reason we really choose to come here for our Christmas dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and food. The dinners and breakfasts are top notch. Service staff could be better and the custodial staff could work harder and keeping the place cleaner."}
{"text":"restaurant week...yay! our first stop in this bi-annual event and it was not disappointing. 

i will have to say, for someone who doesn't get this far away from the house to eat out, it is a bit tricky to find the restaurant. we entered the first entrance to the resort on which this restaurant is located and drove around for a good 10 minutes. went up the hill, then down the hill. to the pool area and back. a staff member said \"follow the signs\" which we tried but only ended up back at the entrance. finally called from the property and were directed appropriately. 

the layout inside is very big. it felt cozy, kind of like a ski lodge with lots of dark wood and mood lighting. the bar sits up high and the restaurant is below. i ordered the calamari and it was cooked just how i like it...ever so slightly chewy, but tender enough to not wear out my jaw. then the scallop dish which was delicious with the risotto. i'm not a risotto connosieur but it tasted great to me. for desert, i ordered the chocolate volcano cake but absolutely could not finish...my taste buds said yes, my belly said no. 

the food is heavy....heavy on the butter and richness. i was full after my entree, but with the wonderfulness of restaurant week, i just simply had to get a desert. 

my wife enjoyed her farmers salad but it was very large and she had to save room for the rest of the meal; the shrimp pasta and apple pie with ice cream. all of which she loved but also said was very heavy and filling. 

i enjoyed my meal. doubtful i could afford to eat here normally. but our service was fantastic from the concierge to the food runners to our server. a great night out."}
{"text":"Loved it. Huge over the top wood work, beautiful. Sat at the bar service was amazing."}
{"text":"Much better food than the more hyped Different Point of View.  They have a killer brunch with an incredible selection."}
{"text":"I stay here a lot when I am in Phoenix and the Pointe In Tyme is not only the closest restaurant but also makes the room service food.  I have eaten here ALOT.  I know the menu by heart.  That said, the niceness of the staff, especially the bartender, Tim, and the consistently good food are what made me give such a high rating.  I usually eat in the bar and when there is a game (almost always) it can get pretty rowdy, but there is always the rest of the restaurant if that bothers you.  My favorite items are the filet mignon (which I only had once because I would big as a house if I ate like that all the time), the grilled salmon (always cooked perfectly), and the ahi tuna tostadas.  The chicken street tacos are also very good.  It is a full bar so you can get pretty much whatever you want, and there is a kind of neighborhood bar feel to the place when it isn't high season and full of tourists.  I have also eaten breakfast here, and the buffet is pretty good, especially when they whip out the little cocktail glasses with peeled grapefruit segments and mint (to die for), but that is not something they consistently have.  Pricey for breakfast, but overall still a surprisingly good restaurant for a hotel."}
{"text":"After my second night here I can say that the food here is pretty good and I would return often if I were local. Mostly I wanted to give 5+ stars to our server Sherry in the lounge who was so kind and helpful. She provided the best service I have received from hospitality in a LONG time. I was so impressed by her-even saw her helping out the bar area.  Thank you Sherry for great service and kindness!"}
{"text":"Nice bar area
Dark wood, cigars avail
Eh, on the beers.  Really, u need to increase your beer selection
Drinks r good, but fresh juice would be mucho better, shows class i think 
Drinks r expensive, so is food
But its mostly for guests who can afford it, and \"gofers\" (golfers)"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. The staff seem to have no clue what is going on. If you ask one person a question, another person will give you a completely different answer. The food is also just dry-heavingly bad. My friend ordered the \"herb roasted chicken\". The chicken was neither herbed nor roasted. It looked straight up boiled. He let me try a bite. It was fatty, rubbery, and literally tasted like someone boiled it and slapped on some balsamic reduction. It was awful. I had the mushroom risotto, which was tolerable. My other friend had a steak with veggies, and the potato cheese casserole side was a lump of fatty, cheesy starch that would make you have stomach issues for a week. The waitstaff was kind enough to try and make things right by offering to cover the cost of the chicken, but honestly I would rather have just paid for some food that tasted good. Avoid at all costs! There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Since we stayed at Hilton Pointe for 4 days we visited this restaurant every day. From late night cocktails, to breakfast, to appetizers, to full dinner - the food is fantastic and doesn't disappoint. 

I love the English golf club interior! It reminded us of Torrey Pines Lodge - which is appropriate since it's right off the golf course pro shop. The entire, complete with elaborate woodwork and two fireplaces, immediately made us feel comfortable and helped us mentally feel like we were in a cooler climate and not the 120 degree weather that was outdoors.

I also love that they have \"glass and a half\" options on their pours - which is a nice upgrade feature.

I had to deduct one star because of service. We had lunch here one day and our older female bartender (we sat at the bar for lunch) was kinda snarky - it could have been misconstrued as rude since we really didn't know her but I'm thinking maybe that's her humor? She disappeared to the opposite end of the bar for a half an hour and put on her reading glasses and played on her phone. Eventually I had to go ask her for our check. 

I do want to mention that all of the gentlemen bartenders were very attentive and provided great service. 

If we do stay on this property again, I'm sure we will once again visit Pointe in Tyme for delicious draft beer, the chef's cheese board, the amazing Cuban sandwich and super cheesy pizza."}
{"text":"I'm wavering between a 3 and 4 star review here. On food alone? 3 stars. I ate the breakfast buffet one morning and had the fruit plate another morning. As far as breakfast options go, this is really your only choice when staying at the hotel other than room service. The breakfast buffet was limited and not that fresh. 

The omlette bar was tasty and worth it, but that was about it. (I mean...they had oatmeal--a breakfast staple in a hotel buffet--but it was pretty much a congealed block.)

The thing that makes me tempted to give 4 stars? Well, both times we ate here the server asked us if we wanted an additional coffee in a to-go cup on our way out. Okay, that may seem like a little thing--but it's *such* a nice and thoughtful touch. 

Aside from that it was utterly mediocre. It's NOT *bad* food or anything--just meh."}
{"text":"The green smoothies here are the bomb.

I didn't actually dine here, I only came several times during my stay to get green smoothies. The service was very nice and friendly. I was able to get a customized veggie fruit smoothie made to cater to my food allergies. That was really nice, everyday I would get one and each day it tasted amazing and I felt great after drinking it. 

They also called for a golf cart to pick me up and take me back to the main building. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for drinks after golf however don't bother for dinner. I ordered the prime rib which was one of the worst cuts of meat I have had in a long time with 70% of it being fat. For the price try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome food.. Awesome ambience.. Very nice staff. Celebrated my anniversary there and really loved it. I also received a complimentary dessert."}
{"text":"Im am giving a 2 because of Linda.  Super unatetive if you are are not a regular. Very curt. I wanted to feel welcome.  She was only there to serve me when i finally got her attention.  Food good. I had the fried chicken. 
Staying at hotel for the 1st time. Nice hotel."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is casual and relaxing. I cannot even begin to say enough nice things about the staff; everyone from the hostess to the server to the management did everything they could to make our evening with them really beautiful and special."}
{"text":"We dropped in for lunch while here for a conference, the server was nice and attentive.  I had the seared ahi tuna tostadas, and they were fantastic!  The only reason they did not get 4 stars is the the bar tender/server/ busser was the same person and the kitchen took a while to get our food out.  We had to eat very quickly to make our next meeting (we alotted 1&1/2 hours to eat).  Otherwise, this was a great place."}
{"text":"Staying at the Pointe Hilton Resort for work travel and came to Pointe in Tyme for a quick dinner. Five stars all the way. I'm literally still sitting in my booth as I wrote this because I don't want to forget to give them a good review. 1. My waiter Gilberto was honestly one of the best waiters I've ever dealt with - friendly, professional, gave just enough attention, he was just awesome! 2. The wine was a perfect pairing to my meal (Gilberto recommended it) 3. The scallops were tender and not chewy... And the risotto was to die for. If you like just the right amount of buttery goodness this ones for you. Thank you Pointe in Tyme for a great AZ dinner!!!"}
{"text":"This place was god but not great. The wait staff was wonderful but the food was certainly not worth the price. I ate here two nights in a row because it was on the resort I am staying at but it was a let down both evenings. The staff were wonderful, once they knew we were there. It was hard to get their attention but very attentive once they discovered us sitting in their section. I also had the breakfast buffet two days in a row, it was good. The real problem I had with this place is that no one had their ducks in row and they are overpriced. I heard three different breakfast and Thanksgiving dinner times and no one was correct. We ended up missing breakfast and thanksgiving buffet because we were told the wrong times. It's kind of a let down when you you have your mind set on thanksgiving buffet and you get there at the time the staff told you it would start only to hear it's over and you can order something off of their regular menu. I tried to like this place but it regularly let me down."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 12 for lunch during the week.   Half of the group received lunch menus and the other half received breakfast menus (breakfast was not being served at this time).  We ordered our drinks first.  The people that ordered hot tea received a pot of lukewarm water to put their tea bag in. The waitress did apologize and brought another pot with hot water.
The wait staff was friendly and courteous.  We ordered a salad and a Cuban Reuben sandwich.  The salad was ok, but not what you would expect at a fancy resort.  The Reuben was ok as well, some of the meat was a little tough.  There are many good restaurants in the valley to try.  We probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"The husband and I have been here 2 times now. First time we ordered the grilled artichokes and mac'n'cheese as an appetizer. The artichokes were amazing! They came with this aioli type dipping sauce that had a great tangy flavor. The mac'n'cheese was really good and came with a boar sausage on top. The portion was huge, so we took it home as a next day lunch. For dinner, the husband ordered the braised short ribs with horseradish whipped potatoes and they were AWESOME! Super tender beef and the potatoes had a great kick that melded well with the beef. I ordered the sea scallops which came with a corn risotto. The scallops were extremely tender and delicious. The husband and I kept eating off of each other's plates, both were so good. For dessert, the husband ordered a flourless chocolate cake. He loved it, and it was good, but not my favorite. The second time we came back with my father-in-law and all three of us ordered the braised short ribs. Definitely a delicious choice. 

We live down the street and have a Tapatio resident card, which allows us 20% off the menu. This is a great deal, since it can get pricey. While the ambiance is a little older inside, the patio is really nice and I'd recommend sitting out there is the weather allows."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. From the time we walked up, we were catered to!  I had my service pet Instagram @HappyBlackChowChow with me so the very gracious professional staff seated me comfortably on the patio this warm, but breezy afternoon. They have the best waitress and chefs! My tomato bisque, cesar salad and grilled shrimp with pasta set my evening off right! I'm a future doctor current scientist FNP so while I travel and study in this journey I find myself with Walden University about to begin the dissertation journey. This restaurant based hotel hosted the event to perfection and my service pet / mascot and I have been very comfortable"}
{"text":"The not as fancy but still tasty younger sibling on the resort, you'll find quality food at reasonable prices to enjoy.

I was able to partake in their breakfast buffet bar for two morning, and definitely enjoyed not only the wide variety of food, but also the decent quality of everything served.  Tray were consistently refilled to be fresh, and the service was spot on ensuring our glasses were filled and whatever extra we needed were taken care of.  

Stopped in on the last day for lunch, and enjoyed a decent burger, but more intriguing was their presentation of their fries.  They serve in little fry basket!  (Yes, what you would imagine at McDonald's when they fry their fries, but muuuuch smaller).  Smart presentation, very neat to see.  

My coworkers pizza didn't like that extraordinary, but I\"m also somewhat of a pizza snob/aficianado nowadays...

Verdict:  If you're on the resort and need a bite, worth visiting.  Otherwise, save your dinner for the big sibling \"A Different Pointe of View\" if you can afford it.  Far more fanciful and spectacular."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here yesterday. The food was so salty it was almost inedible. Expensive sodium! Don't bother."}
{"text":"Pointe in Tyme is so close to having great food but needs to elevate their side dishes and decor just a bit. They have a prime location at the Tapatio Cliff Hotel but they need just a touch of refinement to become one of their premier restaurants. Came in with a group of ten and the service was very good. Server was attentive and thorough. We ordered mac n cheese, calimari, and ahi tuna. Adding crab or lobster to mac n cheese would make more sense than chicken macaroni and cheese as it doesn't seem sufficient as an appetizer for a group. I had the flat iron steak with chimichurri. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend it but potato skins were straight out of a chain restaurant. Again, so close, needs a taste elevation."}
{"text":"Every year we go for the Easter Buffet and even after multiple years at Different Pointe of View, me and my family continue to go to Pointe in Tyme.

Great selection, and I can't judge anything except for what they offer on this particular buffet, but the quality of everything is always high par for buffet style food.

pasta chef, omelet station, just a great all around setup. 
the restaurant is nice and relaxing as well."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We are staying in the resort. Had dinner here the first night. So very average. My husband said his pasta was good, but mine:  not so much. My salmon was greasy, the risotto tasted like bland tomato paste. Ugh. And way overpriced. The only other comparable on-site restaurant was closed. Leave the property for dinner."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Pointe Hotel on a stacation and tried unsuccessfully to get reservations at A Different Point of View, so ended up here.
What a disappointment. I had the Trout and, my mistake, asked for it to be sautéed, it was overlooked and tasted of butter. The potatoes and all the other veggies that came with it were so buttered that this was all you could taste. Head Office had the Salmon which she said was fine.
The reason we had fish was because there was absolutely nothing on the menu that was Veggie, though our overthetop waiter did offer to make something up from another dish. Overall, a bad experience and I had been there before many years ago and also to the one at the South Mountain point and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a miserable time here. While we were seated immediately, everything else was incredibly slow. The waiter took our order about 20 minutes in, and then the long wait began. There wasn't even a basket of bread to tide us over. They gave us a round of free drinks, after an hour, for the inconvenience, but didn't step up the pace. We got our food at the hour and a half mark, and asked for the check at the 2 hour mark. The waiter left the checks, and we didn't see him for another half hour. We complained to management. There's absolutely no reason that it should have taken 2 and 1/2 hours to get a meal and check to 4 people at a small table. The manager decided that the comp'd round of drinks, from earlier was enough off our bill to satisfy that kind of wait. the drinks would cost OUR TABLE $40+, but the actual restaurant only lost around $5.00 in drinks. This was completely unacceptable. I will never recommend this restaurant, in fact I will deter friends from coming here. We had plans for later, to go swimming at the hotel, and we ended up getting a measly 30 minutes of swim time, before the pool closed. The manager didn't do enough to make up for the restaurants mistakes, ruining our moods and our evening plans."}
{"text":"I came in, just needing a drink and a light dinner.  I was talked into the bar burger, not very hard as it looked good.  Service was great, bar tenders curtious, and food was good, but burger was over cooked.  Glad to see people in here on a Monday night.  Nice location, with a good looking menu."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 12 on Saturday morning for breakfast. We all arrived at separate times and agreed that the signs directing you to the restaurant were confusing. All of us got lost, but the detours enabled us to tour the beautiful resort. The Pointe Tapatio is gorgeous, wonderful cliffs, great design... Now if only the restaurant could improve..

Once we were all seated we waited (and waited and waited) to order. The server appeared to take our drink order, perhaps not realizing we had been sitting there for over half an hour and were prepared to order food as well. When he finally returned we were salivating hyenas, yet still more than half the table were unhappy with the meal placed before them.

While we waited an eternity for our food to arrive I looked around the restaurant and noticed how dirty it was. There were 3 separate tables where it looked as though they spilled a pitcher of ice on the floor and didn't bother cleaning it up. We actually saw a busser carrying a tray full of glasses with OJ spilling all over the floor, we called it out to our server but he was nonplussed and took no action.

On to the food:
My personal experience was the best. I ordered an egg, ham and cheese bagel, they brought it out cold with the cheese unmelted. I asked the waiter to have the cooks throw it under the broiler, he rolled his eyes and took my plate. When he brought it back it was still cold and instead of melting the cheese they removed it.. Message here.. If you complain \"No cheese for you!\" At this point my party had finished eating so I ate the cold $12 bagel. 

Pointe in Thyme was a major bummer and very overpriced, I will not return nor recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the amount of bad reviews!
We ended up here on a Sunday morning for the breakfast buffet.
It has a lovely old feel..dark paneling and booths. I think I would have enjoyed that more for dinner, with a roaring fire in the winter. 
For a sunday morning, it was really dark.
The buffet was really good. You can't really mess up breakfast. A nice selection and friendly service.
$16 was pricey but i think pretty typical for a breakfast buffet at a hotel."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was not. We waited probably 30 minutes before ordering our meals and our water glasses were consistently empty. The Flat Iron Steak is tasty and is served with a side of garlic fries, which were delicious. The apple pie dessert is also spectacular."}
{"text":"In the mood for upscale munchies but want to wear your football jersey? Want to watch the game with a crisp, vibrant screen and divulge in delectable drinks? Exited about the possibility of meeting out-of-town guests at a world-class resort? Don't be afraid to pop into the Point in Tyme bar...a mellow mood and laid-back atmosphere complete with the best sports and allure of the unknown..."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere, our wait staff was extremely attentive & delightful. I had their salmon which was delicious. However, my husband had their meatloaf & mashed potatoes, way too spicy. He likes spicy food but this was over powering. I took a bite of his potatoes & my mouth was on fire. The server said they would take it off our bill & they offered something else, but my husband really didn't want to try anything else.

Then it was dessert time. We ordered Creme Brulee but the easier came with a Hot Lava Cake. We ate it as we didn't want to cause anymore problems.

This is my 3rd edit. Got our bill which was correct, then when he brought it back to have me sign it, he had already assigned it to my room, but it wasn't my bill it was considerably more & belonged to someone else. I have now reduced the stars we gave them."}
{"text":"First off this place is beautiful!  I love all the dark wood.  It's worth a visit just for that.  I like to sit at the bar but the restaurant area is also very nice.  Most of the customers seem to be staying at the resort, at least at the bar area.  I often see people sitting alone at the bar area.  The service at the bar is good, never had a problem and everybody is friendly.  

The food while usually pretty good can be hit or miss.  They change their menu from time to time so your favorite may be gone on your next visit.  I miss their bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with brussel sprouts!  Man, that was good. The Ahi tacos are also great!  I also really like their beet salad which comes with both gold and red beets.  I don't get the toffee brittle they put on it though. I had a steak which was cooked the way I asked.  It was pretty good and tender. Grilled salmon with beets was also very good from a year ago. The beef short rib was very tasty but could have been more tender.  The scallops and risotto was very good the first time but the last time it was much different.  Something was off.  It seemed like a different recipe, neither the scallops or the risotto were very good.  

Overall definitely worth checking out if in the area and especially if you are staying at the resort."}
{"text":"Great service, feels very upscale, but not expensive.  I had the Pork Chop, my wife had the roast chicken - can't wait to come Phoenix and go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"A most appealing place for a cocktail. Dark wood paneling with a deep selection of spirits nicely merchandised on the back bar. You would consider this drinking spot a classic looking watering hole. Located on 7th St adjacent to the Tapitio Cliffs Hilton hotel and right at the golf course, it's a convenient place for an  adult beverage. With its attentive service, this bar serves nicely as a 19th hole golf stop or in our case, as a final place for a potent nightcap.

Belly up to the bar and enjoy...

Salute!"}
{"text":"We setup a business lunch here and were not informed they were only serving a \"buffet\" and you could not order anything off the menu .  Buffet is a generous word given that they only had one entree item, pesto tortellini.  They apologized and said they had to feed 800 people that day.  I don't know how this is a problem for the other guests not involved in the conference.  If that's the case, they should have closed the restaurant or at least told people as they came in about the extremely limited menu.

I would definitely not recommend eating here.  In fact, the whole experience will have me looking for a new place for our guests to stay once when they are in town."}
{"text":"Service.... Can make or break a restaurant. We were seated and it took 20 mins for someone to come to take a drink order... Another long pause before ordering our food. My burger that was ordered medium came out bloody.... Won't be eating here again. Pointe in tyme should get their act together"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for restaurant week. It was awesome, good food, great environment, and excellent service.

I had the fried calamari, scallops, and creme brulee, and a glass of chardonnay, all together was 30 dollars. My boyfriend had crab cake, ribeye, and apple pie with chardonnay as well. 

the fried calamari was good, i would prefer it to be a a little bit more crispy though. ' Scallops tasted fishy, but again we are in arizona and fresh seafood is just not an option. They did a good job making sure it is tasty and tender. The pasta that comes with it is just mediocre though, a little bit salty for my tasty. Creme brulee was really good with the crispy top. 

The crab cake was tasty, i like the beans that comes with it. Ribeye was a little bit more cooked than i prefer, but it is juicy, tender, and flavorful. Apple pie was too sweet though.

So the food there was pretty decent and pretty much meets all my expectations. 

The service was wonderful though, the manager and our server keeps on checking on us every few minutes, yet give us enough space to have private discussions.

The atmosphere was good, however, they music was a little bit off for the environment."}
{"text":"The convention I went to at Hilton Pointe did not provide breakfast, but luckily the organization I went with treated us to breakfast on two days here.  It is a short walk from the hotel rooms, but that \"hot like an oven\" Arizona heat enveloped us while we walked there early at 7 AM.  For the first breakfast, we took the golf cart shuttle from the lobby but for the second breakfast we walked.  The first time, we ate in the dining section closest to the buffet bar.  The second time we ate on the other side where there's a fire place.  Being from Hawaii where buffets are bountiful with many food options, in contrast Pointe in Tyme's breakfast buffet was pretty limited.  The beginning of the buffet line starts with fruits, nuts, cheeses, cured meats, crepes, smoothie shots, and a make-your-own yogurt parfait section.  After that is the hot foods which was your basic potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, and link sausages.  In the corner is an omelet station.  The first time I went, there was just too many people waiting for omelets from one cook with three burners.  The second time I went, I really wanted an omelet so I skipped the buffet and got in line behind three other people.  I honestly enjoyed my omelet better than the buffet foods."}
{"text":"We have stayed at the Hilton Tapatio Resort several times but had not dined in a Point In Tyme. We decided to eat there after a long day at the hotel in a conference. I was with my mother and daughter and the front desk offered to drive us to the restaurant which isn't that far from the main office but we declined. 

A walk across the parking lot led us to a Point in Tyne. We were immediately greeted and sat. The restaurant was busy for a Saturday night. We were offered bread which was delicious and ordered.

My daughter had the chicken fingers and fries, my mom a quesadilla, and I had a Caesar salad. Our food came out as expected, and our waiter stayed attentive to our needs coming back frequently for refills and to check in on us. 

After dinner, we ordered dessert for my daughter. She wanted a sundae which promptly was served. Our experience was great- I would highly recommend.

As a bonus, they did offer to drive us back to our suite- which was kindly appreciated. :)"}

{"text":"Difficult to find.  Annoying bar setup with mostly garbage Bud/Miller/Coors products like Blue Moon, and they had the nerve to serve me a Guinness in a frosty glass.  Service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable though.  Old building on the outside but decent inside."}
{"text":"Mothers Day Brunch was awesome from the lamb comps, prime rib, crab legs, Belgium waffles, bacon, omelette, shrimp, sausage and orange juice. Great service and totally stuffed to the point where we could barely move afterwards."}
