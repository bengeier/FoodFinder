{"text":"I recently went to Czehoski on a Wednesday night. Luckily to my surprise, the was half price bottles of wine! The wine selection was not one of the best, however how can you complain with that deal! 

The server was hilarious, and was very attentive to our group. 

The patio is a must if you can grab a spot. 

The one Fail, the DJ that that he was a superstar when clearly I could have done a better job with my IPOD. 

Overall, Loving the vibe, the drinks, and the food of this hipster go to spot."}
{"text":"I read once that this place was a gambling haven for ttc brass. After being served a freezer-burnt costco buger for $16 and a tiny bit of sauerkraut with 2 pieces of  sausage they call \" hunter's stew\" for $18 I can definitely attest that the mediocrity of the ttc has rubbed off on this place. Horrible.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I'm not sure whether this was simply due to the fact that it was \"Winterlicious\", but I was very disappointed by my experience at Czehoski. Service makes or breaks the dining experience, and in this instance it certainly did not \"make\" it. Additionally, the food was quite poor - again I can't say too much about their regular dinner menu since I only had the Winterlicious 2014 items. However, I feel that a sample menu such as this should attempt to showcase the restaurant in the best light possible and entice the customer to come back for the full show. I certainly feel strongly otherwise."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a mini-pub crawl, so my review will only be regarding drinks.  We got here just after 7 p.m. on a Friday, which was great, 'cause we scored to stools at the bar right away.  I had a cocktail with Pimms in it and my boyfriend had an amberish looking beer recommended by the bartender.  We had a great time chatting and drinking, and frankly, being our ridiculous selves.  Oh, and our drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"Mostly I just hate the service at Czehowski. We were on the patio and waited forEVER to be served. In fact, we never did, so we left."}
{"text":"Was here for winterlicious, I think they got a little too experimental with dessert, it wasn't delicious. As well, with the main courses, the portions were under par I was left hungry."}
{"text":"In my reviews, the food quality is a must at the restaurant but the overall experience will be based on the service.  Waiters are the face of the restaurant and trust me, Czehoski needs a makeover. I wish I could mention the name of the server tonight but she didn't introduce herself  It was my girlfriend's birthday and 10 of us, almost all of us working in the fine dining industry, have never felt so disregarded! Not once did The birthday girl feel like it was her special night. We were very excited to go to this restaurant but 6 hours after, I am still enraged!  Like I said, the food quality is being over-shadowed by one of the worst service experiences I have ever encountered.  
There are a handful of Restaurants in the vicinity of Czehoski's that I would would highly recommend, hopefully you can find them!"}
{"text":"Would you like some live jazz with your eggs? 

If youre into the brunch jazz thing and not so much into the $25breakfastbuffet&jazz thing (a la Hot House and Boiler House) head over to Czehoski and make yourself at home next to the stage. (you might not be able to hear your friends out there but who wants to listen to them anyway?)

The brunch menu is seriously minimal ie. 5 things on the menu literally plus an omelette of the day. One of those 5 things is a burger so that makes it 4 brunchy things and 1 of those 4 things is steak so that makes it 3 brunchy things (no my math is not so bad). 
Either way, I didnt regret opting for the egg whites feta and asparagus omelette.They wanted to charge me extra for taking the yolks out of my eggs but I said nonono to which they agreed and gave me a very limp omelette and chose to forego on the fingerling potatoes instead.

If youre really into brunch, I suggest you forego Czehoski..BUT if youre the minimalist type that can handle 3 things on the menu, good coffee, average service and seven times Juno nominated jazz musicians, I suggest you pay a visit on a saturday morning."}
{"text":"Service good. Food okay but overprice. Ambience good."}
{"text":"We went here recently for a friends birthday. Since we were a group of almost 30, they only offered us a fixed menu.

The $35 menu consisted of:

App: Choice of Crab Cakes, Beet Salad or Soup of the Day (Onion and Potato Soup)

I had the crab cakes and they were nothing special. 3 cakes breaded and rolled into balls with aioli. There was a decent amount of crab in it but it wasn't flavorful and it was cold. I tried the beet salad from a friend who was even more disappointed. The beet salad was basically sliced beets stacked on top of each other with little to no dressing or other vegetables.

Main: Choice of Chorizo Risotto, Burger or Pasta.

I had the burger, which was fine. If you've had a burger at Jack Astors, this burger tasted about the same. 

The majority of the group chose the risotto because it sounded promising and it was absolutely flavourless and disgusting. I've had risotto many times in my life and I've never seen the oatmeal/congee looking mess like this was. There was barely any chorizo and you really had to fish for it.

Dessert (Assorted and Served Family Style)

At this point I was frustrated and disappointed (because I'd also received my main much after everyone else.) I saw some small serving bowls of cookies, ice cream and apple pie being passed around but I didn't try any.

This meal was 1. Terrible and 2. Not worth $35/person PLUS the mandatory 18% tip!

I'd be hard pressed to ever eat here again. I understand that it's difficult to cater to larger groups, but after forcing us to have a fixed menu, it's not an excuse."}
{"text":"Way to beat me to it. 
I thought for sure I would be the first.

Overall, I think Czehoski isn't a bad spot.
It's basically a packed resto-bar for those who grew out of clubs but aren't quite ready to totally settle into just easting with friends at high end restaurants yet. Think wall to wall, with loud music, but patrons drinking wine and wearing black head-to-toe.

It's got that old College Street flavor. Back when it wasn't all Euro-trash and bad club music on worse sound systems.
It's three thin floors, with a thin, long rooftop patio at the top.

The front bar is also the cafe, and the back area is a curtained off, private dinning room. The second floor has another bar and a fire place,and this is where you'll find the patio. The third floor is a private dinning room.

The bartenders look like the patrons. They have a great weekend brunch and it's a nice little addition to the Queen West strip of pubs and rock bars."}
{"text":"Food is good but whatever, it's not worth the ridiculous price.  Not worth it at all, unless you want to feel hip and with it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday or a Saturday night just for drinks. The music was better than most nightclubs, and trust me I have been going to those for the last five years.

Would come again just for some sick beats!! (think: minimal, tech, bouncy house)"}
{"text":"This place is has a really nice vibe and the exact kind of decor that I love. It has two floors and a rooftop patio. But I'm only giving it two stars because the food is really just too expensive for the quality and the portions. Our salads were just meh - they would be ok for under 8 dollars, but they are basically a side salad for $12. My friend's mojito was $14 and she claims it's the worst mojito she's ever had in her life. 
The service was great considering it was just one server busting her ass by herself, with some help from the bartender or someone to bus tables. 
This place would be awesome if you just came for a drink and took advantage of the drink specials."}
{"text":"I made reservations here for my Sister's 46th Birthday. It was for three people, on a Saturday evening at 6:30 PM. Upon arriving, we were seated at a booth that had comfortable but overwhelmingly small seating space and it was right in front of the kitchen. Our waitress was the star of the evening for sure as she was helpful, attentive and friendly enough without being overly so. We selected a wine upon the waitress's word, and were not disappointed. As well, we ordered just about everything she recommended and all the food was fabulous. Our evening however was marred over and over by the kitchen staff just doing their job.  With constant yelling of \"Service\" that interrupted our dinner conversation and being uncomfortable 'squished' into that booth. 
I have to say I was wholly disappointed that we had to be seated in such a lousy way when we made reservations and although I will go here again (The cheese board and wine is my new personal favourite), I will make sure I pick the seating.
After coming home i was so disappointed to hear there is a fireplace and even better seating elsewhere in the restaurant, and I will be scoping that out next time for sure. I would recommend this for intimate conversations, romantic dinners or a quiet night out with friends."}
{"text":"Great bar to chill at any day of the week, great patio during the summer, great microbrews, great date spot... what more do you want?"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my hair stylist (Nina at W salon!) who told me the burgers were amazing, so I had to check it out myself. The place has a unique, downtown cool vibe, channeling NYC for sure with it's rooftop patio and local art on the wall. The music playing was classic rock at its finest, Fleetwood Mac and Heart with some cool 80s tracks mixed in for flavor. The servers were friendly and attentive, not pretentious in the least, which it easily could be being on Queen West and all. 

I had the veggie burger and my friend had the regular burger ($10 each), both were homemade and fresh and nothing short of amazing. I will definitely be heading back soon, next time for dinner and drinks. Mmm.

One of the best new restos I've been to in a awhile!"}
{"text":"First time reviewing but I had to share this horrible experience. Came here last night for dinner with the girls. 
The fact that they ran out of some of their beers on a Saturday night should have been the first warning sign. That's okay we ordered a bottle of wine instead. We waited an HOUR and a HALF to get our meals. I asked our waitress several times what was going on and she told me that they were super busy with a private party upstairs. I'm not sure how putting together a cheese and kielbasa plate and pierogis takes over 90 minutes. Typically you hire extra staff if you know you have a private party coming. 
So the food finally came and we were all very disappointed. The cheese and meat plate was okay but nothing outstanding. The pierogis were horrible. You can get better pierogis from the frozen food section of the grocery store. My friends had the Mac n cheese which was mostly over cooked macaroni with limited cheese. We did end up getting 15% off our meal. Maybe this was just an off night for them but the food killed this place for me and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was here recently to catch some acts as part of Indie Week and have to say that it was a pretty poor layout for live music. The \"stage\" seems to be used as a storage area most of the time (there were flats of vegetables taking up a bunch of the small space). The Indie Week acts started around 8, which was still prime dinner hour at Czehoski. The stage is at the back of a narrow area back past the kitchen and all of the tables in the area were occupied by people eating dinner. Which meant that a) all the diners had to listen to bands they may or may not have intended to see and b) there was no room for those of us trying to watch the bands. And the sound was pretty terrible - i don't generally think I have an 'ear' of any kind (being more medical and less musical myself) but even I could hear that all the instruments were poorly balanced and there was some sort of constant buzzing through the sound system. 

Points for having Maudite on tap, though. That was tasty."}
{"text":"Czehoski is a Toronto institution.  The faded namesake sign is the original sign from 1924 when it was a butcher shop and deli owned by a Polish/Czech family.  It is also my local bar where I consider myself a regular.  In fact, I go there so often that I've been declared the 'mayor' on foursquare (a social network). But I usually go there for late night drinks after I've eaten dinner.  This was because Czehoski's reputation as a restaurant was not stellar; it was just a fun place to have drinks.  Well they've changed things up and hired a new chef.  Good place to eat poutine, burger as well as protein dishes such as any of their meat selection.  Desserts are stellar too!  (House made marshmallows- just sayin')"}
{"text":"We were there on a Friday evening with a reservation, waited 30 minutes for our cocktails, and then almost 2.5 hours for our dinner to come. About an hour after we ordered the waitress came back and told us one of the things 3 of us ordered was now unavailable - at that point they hadn't even started cooking our mains yet. To top it off, the manager was extremely rude to us at the end of the night. There are lots of amazing restaurants in the area with better food and WAY better service - don't waste your money or time with this one."}
{"text":"I went to Czehoski ages ago, and all I can say is: GET THE PEROGIES!! I still remember how amazing they were, and it's a dish I'd return for."}
{"text":"I found a Groupon for Czehoski and quickly jumped to give this place a try. Part of the Groupon, we get two appetizers and two main dishes. My friend and I decided to share, so we got to try more things.

We ordered: beet salad, crab cakes, pulled pork mac n' cheese, and perogies. The food was great and I highly recommend giving the crab cakes a try. 

The service was friendly and the restaurant is blasting music, so it's more of a causal place to get together. 

After a long week of midterms, we had to try the drinks. The Queen West Mojito was well made, but I definitely had better ones.

Wouldn't have tried this restaurant otherwise, so that Groupon deal was definitely a good buy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have each had drinks at Czehoski many times, but neither of us had ever eaten there.  After a very long day this past Wednesday, we decided we didn't want to cook, so we stopped in to Czehoski for an impromptu dinner out, and availed of their Winterlicious menu.

We were both drawn to the same menu items, so unfortunately I can't report on much variety.  We both had the crab cakes and thoroughly enjoyed them.  And then we both had the steak frites.  It was nicely done, but not amazing.  The fries were great!

For dessert we shared a custard and an apple crisp, and gobbled both down.

There was a steady stream of diners for a Wednesday evening, and there also seemed to be a big group in the back, so they can accomodate a big group.  I've always like the vibe at Czehoski, and it's a cool, relaxed but nice play to have some drinks.  And now I know the food is decent too.  I have heard raving reviews of the food before, and I wouldn't say it lived up to those expectations.  But it's a nice place for a date or a relaxing but trendy night out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great scene, live music. Good art on the wall. They need to make the patio have more tables with umbrellas. I should talk to somebody about that. Food is good and great cocktails."}
{"text":"Searching high and low for a place to grab a bite to eat, my trusty yelp app led me to Czehoski.  The staff was very friendly but no matter how hard I tried (and trust me, with that Irish server of theirs I tried hard) I just didn't dig it.  The food just wasn't up to snuff.   I ordered the risotto and while flavourful, I found it was completely under cooked.  I didn't have the heart to tell the Irish server to take it back, so I left 3/4ths of my $18 meal on my plate.  I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for drinks and a snack on a Saturday night around 10pm. It was busy and we had no reservation, but luckily we were seated within minutes. The place became very busy after 11pm. 

The layout is nice, but the decor upstairs is stark white walls with trite 80's style artwork. The service was decent (though table service stops promptly at 11:30, after that you have to go to the bar). 

The food we ordered ranged from OK to disgusting. The \"tempura\" vegetables were deep fried with fish-n-chips batter and drenched in oil. After a few pieces I felt sick to my stomach. We also doubted how fresh the vegetables were pre-frying, as one piece was unusually bitter and another had some dark coloration, not sure if it was burnt or moldy. Also mediocre were the \"boneless chicken wings\". They were basically chopped up chicken breast with some sort of General Tso sauce and a blue cheese dip that usually accompanies chicken made with buffalo wing sauce. 

Way overpriced for both food and drinks. I can't even say it's style over substance, because there wasn't much of that either. Go for drinks if you have to, or to watch people who want to seem cool."}
{"text":"3.25 well drinks on sunday night? not a single television in sight? yes please. awesome way to spend an evening getting to know someone in this city."}
{"text":"Service was gracious, but inattentive. 

Food was tasty, but not stellar.

Desserts sounded charming, but fell flat.

Drinks were good, but over priced. 

Rooftop patio was lovely, but atmosphere was okay. 

I actually had a very nice time at Czehoski, and probably would return for a drink and maybe some snacks on the patio, but I don't find it worth it to have a whole meal again."}
{"text":"Just did Winterlicious here -- disappointing. Not offensively bad, but I won't be back.

Starter: I ordered the \"beet salad\", which ended up being a mixed green salad with two tiny slices of beet hidden amongst the leaves. \"Orange fragments\" mentioned as an ingredient on the menu ended up being tangerine slices out of a can. My partner had the borscht, which was served just above room temperature. Not great.

Entree: I had the filet mignon, which was specified on the menu as being \"cooked to order\". The waitress didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked, which I didn't even notice and which I usually don't really care about -- but when it came, one of the two medallions was dry and a bit overdone and the other was extremely rare. Not a big deal to me, but really weird -- what were they thinking in the kitchen? My partner had the pierogies -- they were okay, I guess.

Dessert: The creme brulee was lukewarm but cold in the middle; the chocolate cake tasted like it came from Metro (dry, with sugary icing). 

For $25, the meal was underwhelming and overpriced. Certainly not an effective advertisement to new patrons (which is the whole point of Winterlicious). The service was also off-putting -- our waitress seemed like she was annoyed to be working there. We thought about complaining but figured she wouldn't bother passing it up the chain. We also observed her interactions with other customers and they seemed to get it even worse than we did.

Get off my lawn, Czehoski!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this restaurant for some time. TeamBuy had a $25 voucher for $50 value so the time was right. Later we found out that Buytopia had a $25 voucher for $55. Strange that these would be running at the same time? We made our reservation for 7pm and put our order in a few minutes later., didn't get our food until 8pm. It's likely that kitchen was short-staffed since the weather was lousy. The steak frites and the filet mignon we ordered came to our liking. Food was ok, ambiance ok. Save your $$ and wait for the group vouchers to come up.."}
{"text":"They changed their already pathetic menu and now have barely anything. In a neighbourhood with so many other options I'm shocked that this place is in business. Not a fun place to be."}
{"text":"Overpriced, awful food. I had the fish and chips ($19) and it was bland, greasy and horrible. I ended up pulling the fish out of the batter and just eating it with a few of the sad soggy fries. My partner has the steak frites ($25), the steak was not trimmed properly and was mostly inedible fatty tissue, it was undersalted and not a cut I would expect to receive for that price. They need to change the oil in their deep fryer and check the temperature. The dessert (apple crumble) was poorly executed and overpowered by rosemary (a very strange choice). It came with ice cream that immediately melted in the hot skillet so that it became a soupy granola with rosemary. We didn't even eat half of it. With a glass of wine, this horrible meal came to $74."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Always a good time - good food and good wine. Nice atmosphere, and half off wine nights make it even better :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a Canadian Music Week event and found it to be quite fun! Almost surprisingly, there's a bouncer out front to check IDs (only of certain people AKA me). But the vibe inside was cool with a long bar and concert space in the back. 

Since there were no free boothes on the main floor, six of us were forced upwards. There's you'll find another bar and plenty of tables. Maybe the most impressive aspect was how people didn't mind sharing a table with us. A server even commented to encourage the merge. There was also a very interesting display of art which I'm sure is every-changing. 

The drinks I sampled, a vodka sour and a vodka seven, were too strong. As a student, to many this seems like a odd thing to complain about but it was simply a need for a larger glass, with more mix. We learnt by the time of our second drink, and got the vodka seven topped up with cranberry juice. The service was always friendly, jokey and accommodating. 

At 1 AM a pair of DJs came on we had a little dance at the front. Solid time, I would come again."}
{"text":"this trendy fusion bar makes anyone want to venture into hipster-ville before hipster became the new cool thing to be, which by virtue ruins all thing hipster. regardless they have a great menu, make a mean ass mojito and if you catch them on the right night, live music or a dj spinning undercover records from bands you had long forgotten existed. also one of the best patio spaces in the city in my non humble opinion. definitely worth checking out if you're in the toronto area looking for a great time in a non pretentious place (note: written at a time where the restaurant/pub is still underpopulated by the masses, pretentious factor may change with increasing popularity)"}
{"text":"Some people love this place and others not so much...there seems to be a divided line between those who are for it and those who are against it. This concept is not new or thought provoking. But, rather than take one side or the other, I had to see for myself what Czehoski was all about.

After making a reservation a few days in advance, as I had heard was necessary, my friend and I arrived punctually and ready for some action. Sadly, this action did not take place as we were seated at the very back on the bottom floor next to a large black curtain. What was behind this curtain? I failed to discover the mystery as we promptly asked the server to seat us elsewhere...at least in the company of other diners. 

Soon enough we were seated upstairs where things were a little more lively. The restaurant is classically decorated and has a nice feel to it. I immediately felt at ease, especially once I had a tasty caesar in hand, and was ready to order some good eats. The menu offers up some exemplary homemade dishes, such as mac n' cheese, lasagna and pierogis. I opted for the beet salad and the Czehoski burger. Why I often order burgers is not lost on me - they ARE a safe bet, right? Well...sometimes. While neither dishes knocked my socks off, both were equally satisfying and the spicy caesar seemed to make up for whatever flavors the meals were lacking. Next time, I really must be more adventurous and order the chicken (wink).

Now that I've been to Czehoski's, I wonder what side I'll collaborate with...for or against? I think I prefer riding the line..."}
{"text":"I dropped into Czehoski for some drinks with some friends.  I really like the feel of the place.  It has very high ceilings with a very nicely stocked bar.  We sat down and had some food.  The food was ok but nothing special.  I'd compare it slightly better than bar fare (which I consider different than sports bar fare) but I hope they up their menu.

I found out there was a bar upstairs and we went upstairs to have some more drinks.  I tried a bunch of different drinks and they were pretty good.  I like the Betty Ford and the fact they have Blanche on tap.  

The place wasn't packed and the staff was super friendly!  I'm looking forward to my next trip to try out some more food and drinks."}
{"text":"I finally visited Czehoski after hearing about their Pierogis.  The restaurant is warm and comforting when you enter.  The offer nightly drinks specials which added incentive to get a drink.

The menu would be described as comfort food.  The pierogis are gourmet-up; sweet potato and gouda filling - interested flavours not sure I would order it again though.
Their crab mac and cheese was da bomb, rich, creamy and cheesey but I was searching for crab pieces through my meal.  The beef poutine was greasy, divine and  delicious.  I felt carbed out after my meal.

I would give the food 3.5 stars out of 5. 

Service was awesome - we had a great server who entertained us between plates.

I would come back again to try out other items on their menu or maybe just for their drink specials."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favourite bars in Toronto, but a string of poor experiences (Terrible food, average drinks, a bartender who told me to \"Go back to Brampton\" at the end of the night) has left me not wanting to come back. I used to love the cocktails here (especially the Mojito and the Caesar) and a fun crowd and music. Maybe I'll revisit on a night where I have nothing else to do. Till then Au revoir Czehoski. You were good to me. Mostly.
Also for the record, I have never lived in Brampton."}
{"text":"We were walking down the street on our way to Terroni when I spotted a sidewalk sign saying \"Cava and Oysters\" in front of Czehoski. I couldn't resist. I love cava and I love oysters. Combination of the two? I had to go in. It's a beautiful restaurant. We were seated on the second floor by the fireplace, which was nice. It was fairly quiet for a Friday evening at about 7:30pm, but that was fine. We ended up only having the cava and oysters, so I didn't try any of the other food, but I do have to say that whatever it was that the couple seated next to us had, it sure looked good!

I would probably go there again to try out a few appetizers and have a glass of wine. I'd prefer to go on a bustling night, if that happens there."}
{"text":"Worst summerlicious ever. I am literally still sitting here at the table 3 hours later. They had to comp our meals it took so long. They switched servers on us... Apparently the manager was supposed to come talk to us and never showed. 
Of the 9 items on the summerlicious menu we were told they were out of 2 of them. 
The beef perogies were terrible. The cottage cheese crepe was vile. 
Of what we were being charged for (the drinks) there were a number of drinks that showed up on our bill that weren't ours. 

I love summerlicious but wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone... Ever."}
{"text":"I checked out the Czehoski Summerlicious menu last night. Sadly, it left much to be desired for the vegetarian in the room. 

My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the Smoked Mackerel, Seared Ontario Lamb Saddle, and creme caramel for dessert. 

My vegetarian option consisted of: Roasted Tomato Consomme, Risotto of local summer vegetables, Mozzarella Bufuala and for dessert I had the 'brownie'.

The risotto was actually quite lovely. I enjoyed it. The tomato consomme was pretty much canned tomato juice with some basil tossed in it and the brownie could be compared to a day old bran muffin. 

I was so looking forward to trying the food there and I'm surprised actually. I have yet to try out their regular menu, so I'm not going to write them off completely. I've heard good things about their mac-n-cheese and veggie burger. Perhaps I'll revise this review or write a new one when I try some other items. Sorry Czehoski."}
{"text":"Czehoski has some decidedly non-vegetarian poutine. Why do I kill myself a little bit for cheese and gravy on top of fries? Oh, but I do want to get to the bottom of who has the best poutine in town.  So, on my quest, Czehoski... They have some great drinks, a wide selection of beer and a small wine collection.  All good, until you get the munchies, leading to the consumption of unhealthy food- poutine.  The poutine here has chunks of bacon(?) and a smooth, non-canned gravy. One of the best, I've had, I say while trying to avoid the meat-like pieces and get to the cheesy fries!"}
{"text":"This part of Queen Street West generally has a dive bar vibe going on and from the outside the worn out sign gives that impression which is probably why I have not been inside before.

Have been here once on dive bar Friday's and although they tend to charge $5 cover it is worth it for a chilled out drink and a decent crowd. A pretty good selection of hard liquor at the bar and a few beers on tap from what I remember. It is too narrow and small to be a place you would go to dance even though they did have a small dj set up that night.

Recently went again during the week for a drink and ended up ordering their chicken wings.

WOW - only five on a plate  but these are full grown super huge wings! Total struggle to eat and if you can get through the portion without any sauce stains around your face and clothes then you need to tell me how you did it.
The sauce is great, and the wings are juicy.

I went during a quiet night so the service was good and only a few other people in the place.

Would definitely go here again for more wings or other menu items."}
{"text":"Had brunch here and expected much better than the taste of food that was delivered. It was costly and I was left dissatisfied. Although, I would probably return to try their dinner so I must have liked something about the place!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, I think it'd be more of a fun place to go for drinks."}
{"text":"Came with a Groupon, but the experience was no different than from other times we've come here.

Beer: So nice to have seasonal beers on tap. Granville Winter Ale: kudos!

Service: Very personable & helpful.  Appreciative of the fact that I tipped on the regular amount as opposed to the discounted amount.

Food:
Wings - Tender, which is hard to find in this city. Lots of ppl like St. Louis and that kind of garbage.  This is way better.
Beet salad - Also delicious.

Beef Ribs - Generous portion and delicious. Meat fell off the bone and was tender.  Sauce accompanied very well.
Bigos - Ok, the broth was was thin/weak. My reco: beef\" it up here.

Summary:
My wife didn't like it as much as she's lactose intolerant and missing the creams that came with the appetizers, which I used for the mains as well.  If in the area, I'd try and compare Lisa Marie."}
{"text":"I came for buck a shuck oysters yesterday and got a seat on the patio-- the makings of a lovely summer evening. But unfortunately czehoski did not deliver. 

Czehoski is a 3 level bar/restaurant with daily food and drink specials. It is because of the many specials and large space that I am not giving them one star. They really need to get their act together IMO. 

Our oysters took over 20 minutes to come out, and when they did, the bed of ice they were on had almost completely melted. Frankly, I'm surprised they allowed this to leave the kitchen. Water spilled all over me when the server plopped the oysters on the table, and she didn't even apologize. I told her she'd spilled on me, and she ignored me. 

I know this is not an oyster place, but it's like they are not even trying. They don't tell you what kind of oysters they have. They also don't offer sauces other than horse radish and hot sauce. 

I was still hungry after I finished my oysters, but I got the bill because I didn't want to give them any more of my business. I went down the street to another restaurant and ordered dinner. I will never return to Czehoski."}
{"text":"First off I 'd like to say i enjoyed the restaurant and will be back for a girls night during the week. The ambiance is semi dark with candles, elegant yet cozy, long and narrow.  This is a typical trendy chic bar, where the food is unique and the drinks are pricey.  I came with my husband for our anniversary and we both had the Beef ribs which were 4.5 star quality and HUGE! Well worth the price for this dish. When we got our appetizers my husband looked a little worried because they were kinda small for the price. The beet salad was ok, something missing / odd and slightly over priced, my husband wanted to trade me. The 2 crab cakes, thought small,  were fresh, meaty and tasty. We left stuffed to the max due to the generous Beef Ribs, so no dessert for us.  We ordered the ceasar and gin & juice. Good unique drinks, price respective to other trendy restaurants, but seemed stingy for some reason. I will be back for the half price wine bottles on Wednesday to try the popcorn and poutine! Great place to bring a date, they have an upstairs but it was all reserved. They Also have a Tuesday special wing night i will definitely try! Our waitresses were very cool and attentive and the food came out surprisingly very fast!   I did have a groupon but I would have eventually  tried it since i live a few minutes away."}
{"text":"No matter how many times I come here, I just can't rid my mind of the many years that Czehoski sat covered in nothing but bird poo. Not just a little bit of bird poo... probably 20 years of bird poo. Because I worked in the neighbourhood from 2000-2004 I had to walk by that soiled storefront every single day. Twice a day. If you do that math, that's a lot of bird poo to see (and I have a pet bird). Perhaps if they had changed the name, I wouldn't be reminded of the sign... the poo covered sign.

Poop aside, I'm just not in love with this place-- and I want to be, because I am part Polish. But I don't see a whole lot of Polish on the menu with the exception of the Pierogies, but I have a Polish grandmother so I'm super spoiled in that respect. (Love you, Gramma!). The cheese platter was okay, but the cheap wine was better.

I also have issues with the bathroom. If you're a - drinkin' on that patio, as I am known to do on a Summer's Eve, walking all the way down that narrow staircase is enough to make me quite afraid. How have more people not died on those stairs??

Czehoski is not bad. However, I've come to the conclusion that I have no shortage of Polish food or bird poo in my life, so I'll stay home and drink cheap wine on my patio for free."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and I do have to say that I am disappointed because this place has so much potential.

It's a nice place with a good atmosphere. Interactions with everyone was nice and I really appreciated the owner/manager working front of house bringing food and speak with guests. The food was good but nothing amazing that wowed me.

What disappointed me was that with a good selection of beer that's supposed to be on tap, I was told they only had 3. And from reading other reviews this wasn't just today. If you advertise beer on your menu, you should at least have most of them.
Also I found it kind of difficult at times to find our server and other tables even had to speak to the manager about that.

In the end, it's an okay place maybe worth trying but probably not more than once for me."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good - the ribs are a standout though, massive, saucy, meaty and delicious.  Just like how I like my men. 
The onion rings were a bit too greasy for my liking, but the poutine was delish, with the right amount of pulled pork.
Drinks are great, the vibe is great, and its a place where you can never go wrong."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday evening for the oyster special. The rooftop patio is nice, though a bit crammed. Still it feels intimate.

Service was okay. The oysters however were a complete disappointment - tiny, WARM and the first round had literally no horseradish or any sauce to speak of. I get it's a special deal but other places in town do it for much better at the same price - check out La Societe on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Czehoski felt like it was trying too hard. Although the place was interesting, there were too many annoying things that made the experience dull and boring (sounds like a date gone bad).

We went for a friends birthday and made reservations for 5 ppl. Our table was ready but the tables themselves wer sticky and oily. I'm like, what the hell? Did they not know we were coming? Wait staff were nice and prompt in the beginning but were too eager to get our orders in and came at the wrong times. We felt like we were being rushed. Later on in the night it got a little busier and so the service started to go really slow. Food came horribly late and they blamed it on the large group that were beside us. Their timing was so off but when it came for the check, they were prompt and quick. So disappointing.

Drinks we ordered were not good. Too sweet or not sweet enough. For a place like this I would expect better drinks. The riesling white wine I ordered with my meal - they ran out of and served it when I had nearly done my meal.

Food was just okay but over priced for the quality. Wife had the veggie burger and it was good - for a veggie burger. I had the lasagna. It was meatless which I love but was not up to par for my standards. I don't even think they should call it lasagna. A lasagna should have layers of melted cheese. It was deconstructed with two large sheets of pasta noodle, diced undercooked eggplant, a couple of globs of sour cream on top, and a small sprinkle of parmesan cheese. It actually felt like I was eating  spaghetti.

Too bad, I was expected more from this place. Not a even a good overall experience."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Czehoski was when my friend suggested it for her birthday earlier this year (Jan 2012). We had the Winterlicious menu and it was good but not great but also not too expensive.

However, the second time was in July 2012 for a friend's rehearsal dinner and we had the Summerlicious menu. I had the roasted black cod, with mushrooms. The mushrooms tasted disgusting (I normally love mushrooms). They tasted really earthy and rotten. 

And the worst part: the fish had a worm in it. It wasn't wriggling, but just embedded in the fish flesh. Gross."}
{"text":"I went to Czehoski's during Winterlicious, for the first time after hearing so much about it. 

We were seated at the back (the first in that section) The next couple that arrived was seated directly next to us. There were lots of other tables. 

The food was not good. I couldn't even eat the appetizer, it was a taco, a freezing cold taco (if it's going to be cold- the menu should note that. Tacos are typically warm) 

The main I got the pot pie. It was tasty enough, but after having no appetizer, I was starving and the portion was tiny (And I'm usually someone that likes small portions). And their dessert was nothing exciting (I left half of it, and it was dessert, who leaves half of dessert? come on!). 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but horrible food. I got a burger, which was overcooked and barely edible without drenching it in ketchup."}
{"text":"My first trip out into the city and after getting a lay of the land we decided to have a late lunch at Czehoski's.  I loved the space.  Even though the upstairs wasn't open when we arrived, sitting in the booths in the bar area gave us a great vantage to take in all the nuances this ex-butcher shop had to offer.  The staff was so cordial, from being seated to drink order to dining service and even engaging us prior to our departure.

The food was wonderful - I so wanted to order Poutine, but opted for the veggie cheeseburger and fries.  The burger had great flavor and the texture was creamier than I anticipated.  The roll unfortunately was a bit dry and overwhelming to the texture and size of the burger.  The fries were the star I have to say - perfect in size, the right balance of crispy and softness, and the saltiness was spot on.  My BFF ordered the fish n' chips and said it was outstanding.  From my view the more than generous portion of lightly battered fish looked crazy good.

After we were stuffed, and had a couple of drinks to wash down our great meal we did take a peek at the upstairs space - an extra bar, a dining space with a fireplace, it would be a great place to eat when I come in for my next visit....and there will be a NEXT visit here!"}
{"text":"I've always driven by Czeohski on Queen West and wondered what lay beyond the rustic sign in big red letters.  I'd seen it as an option for Winter/Summerlicious but always passed it over for other menus.   Last night I finally took the plunge and discovered what it was all about.

With a Dealfind voucher and my best friend in tow we ventured to this Queen West hotspot.  The dimly lit restaurant is seemingly small until you're taken up a set of steep stairs to reveal a second floor through which you discover there is a rooftop patio (that is extremely popular with most tables serving as a layover spot until a spot opens up).

Czehoski, formerly a Czech-Polish butcher shop has maintained more than just the original signage.  Items such as Borscht and Pierogies pay hommage to its predecessor.

We sip our drinks to a white noise and mindless chatter until the DJ arrives and the speakers are blaring with a great selection of tunes. I'm not quite sure what to think of the restaurant as I sit down by the window with a painting of a naked woman; her butt cheeks just inches from my head.

But that quickly fades into the background after I've had my first drink - a refreshing Pimm's Cup ($13) made with Beefeater gin, Pimm's citrus, muddled cucumber + berries, mint, agave nectar and gingerale.  While the ambiance is that of an overall pub, the prices certainly digress.  When I can get a mixed drink a few doors down at the Dog's Bollocks for just $5; it makes me seriously reconsider just sticking with dinner and going elsewhere for my night cap.

For starters I opt for the Beef Poutine ($11) which I'm told is traditionally made with tongue and tail, topped with Ontario cheese curds, sour cream and cabbage.  At a glance it loosely resembles a Fries Supreme at Taco Bell; but after having tasted the heap of crispy fries my doubts are settled.  The meat gravy is extremely tasty and hot enough to melt the curds.  I'm not sure what to make of the sour cream as it doesn't do much to enhance the flavour.

My best friend opts for a plain plate of Russet Frites ($5) which, while simple are tasty in their own right (unlike the bland aioli that comes with).  I'd stick with the good ol' ketchup.

For our mains we continue down the road to dieter's destruction with a Pulled Pork Mac +_Cheese ($19.95) which is rather bland, save for the overly sweet BBQ sauce that masks a somewhat dried pork.   Ironically, the Sweet Potato Pierogies ($19.95) are the better choice as the natural sweetness of the tater contrasts the smoked Gouda.

Service is friendly though lag time between drinks to ordering to getting the bill becomes increasingly annoying as we try everything from turning our heads and closing our menus to entice our server to attend to us.

The damage at the end of the day for dinner (includes 2 beers + the Pimm's Cup) is about $93 before tax and tip, which, without the $50 voucher is a bit steep for comfort food.  However, the art of making a good pierogi shouldn't be discounted and I would gladly pay $20 for a quality dumpling as I would a quality plate of pasta.

All in all, I had a great time at Czehoski and will definitely return to sit on the patio and try the charcuterie and Borscht - and maybe if service is a little speedier next time I'll actually get to dessert."}
{"text":"Don't let the location and the beat-up sign fool you, this place is quite nice on the inside. We arrived on Friday at 7 with a reservation which was clearly not needed. We sat in the back for dinner but it was empty despite being busy up front.

The service from the waiter was excellent from start to finish, formal in a way that was unexpected but not cold. It was a perfect balance and much appreciated.

As for the food, I wouldn't usually order things like mac 'n cheese or perogies but based on his recommendation I did and they were excellent. The crab cakes were excellent, although ginger isn't something I'd usually put on them it was nice for something different, but I liked them plenty with just the sauce.

Price was very reasonable and alcohol wasn't marked up as much as you might think. A thoroughly good dinner. I would return."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but the staff was friendly and my mixed beverages were quite tasty. Plus, I heard the ribs are fab - something to try next time. 

In conclusion, I'd offer it a \"next time\"."}
{"text":"Disappointed much?!

I met a group of friends here Sunday afternoon, I was looking forward to this place as I had heard good things. The patio filled super quick given it had only just opened but that is not the bar's fault so we took a seat inside for cocktails, the Caesar was good! 

A few cocktails later we were hungry and  the food did look good. One of our group had eaten here before and said it was fine. So I started trying to obtain menu's. This was a considerable task as up until this point the service had been pretty rubbish and slow...it wan't that busy either. So after being ignored several times, I went and found menus for the table. 

We decided on what we all would like to eat then waited about 15 minutes to get a server. The server only approached us as she wanted the menu's we had, I said we were ready to order and she said I will be back in 2 minutes to take the order...now don't get me wrong I did not expect her back in 2 minutes...but 10 minutes later and we are still getting ignored by her as she passes our table countless times...ridiculous. 

We decided at this point to get the bill and leave, go get food elsewhere. Awful, awful service. I will not be returning any time soon"}
{"text":"I went there for a glass of wine in a week day and the ambiance was cosy. I haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"Small place warm and cozy... Perfect for a Tuesday drink ... Didn't try the food though... Went there for wing night special but they had stopped it which sucked"}
{"text":"Loved the mac n cheese, found the staff better than I expected, as I was expecting douche bag hipster queen west idiots.

I like this place, but I'm not sure if I fit in with the rest of the hipster doofus clientele.

If you can dig that scene, with your fashion black prescription frames that have no lenses that you wear for no purpose other than to look like dicks to people who actually have to suffer with glasses/contacts etc, you will fit right in."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town and was told to take her to some new places in the T-dot. So, I figured since I have now finally emerged out of my shell and am no longer a student - I can finally check out the Toronto i have always loved! 

It is a truly fabulous place - art on the walls, very friendly servers, 3 floors including a roof top patio, tasty food, and live music!! 

I did not really feel like I was in Toronto at this place - which got me to thinking that maybe Toronto has transformed into this utterly delightful place while i have been in hiding under library books! I am soo excited to see and taste more! Czehoski has inspired me to seek out more interesting places in the city! 

So, I actually did not have a sample of everything on the menu just the nacho's and the smooth, creamy, light,  and divine flan..oohh i am drooling...excuse me. 

The nacho's were actually cheaper than the drinks to my surprise...and made in that foodie kind of way. Baked nacho covered in cheese, topped with fresh guac, black beans - and airy creme frache...oh...the memories. So delightful. 

I can't wait for the summer to enjoy the roof top patio. I would give 5 stars...but my gal pal had a gin and tonic that was sub par. It is not a very difficult drink to make - but she said it was probably the worst one she has ever had. Also, my mom had the house pinot grigio which she said was horrible. Even if a house wine is on the cheaper end doesn't me it has to taste cheap. 

So, the review is actually a 3.85. I hope I can get it up to 5 stars on my next visit!"}
{"text":"A little fancy restaurant in the Queen West area. From the outside, it reminds me of a rustic restaurant in NYC. I ventured to Czehoski as part of Summerlicious. I'm not a big fancy-smancy restaurateur by any standards, but I appreciate good quality food. 

Like most of these type of restaurants, this restaurant was lit pretty dark (I attempted to take pictures of my food, and had to use my big ol' flash.. How classy of me). Because I did Summerlicious, food selection was limited (I'm a vegetarian too, which just makes it all the easier).  The food I did order was really good. Portions were not overly tiny, I don't recall being hungry afterward.. Come to think of it, I don't remember anything at all... 

Good first date restaurant, especially if you're not really into the person.. Blind date perhaps? The dark lighting I think makes anybody look good. Tables are pretty close together, so don't expect to be declaring your undying love for the girl/boy you just met. Perhaps during dinner you can ponder, how on earth do you pronounce Czehoski anyways.. Anyone?!?"}
{"text":"Be sure not to sit beside the door. It's cold and food gets cold very fast.
I had Risotto. It was OK but too much white wine in it. My friend enjoyed her pirogies, apparently it was good."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Czehoski. I've been going there every few months since I moved to Toronto about 6 years ago. Unfortunately, my most recent experience there was less interesting. I sincerely hope they go back to their old menu, because several of my favourite items seem to have disappeared from it ( I do realize it changes seasonally) It is also entirely possible they have changed chefs. Anyhow, if you are, like me, a beef rib lover, they are no longer available it seems. The Czehoski Cesar used to be a staple: seems like it was half mixed with sangria this time. Sans ribs, I had to choose something else to order: went for the sweet potato pierogies which were decent I should say. The cheese plate had pretty terrible bread and the server barely could inform us of what the cheeses were... Which I totally wouldn't mind if the prices weren't still so steep! anyways, I'm definitely not one to complain usually and I seriously hope this was a fluke :) I'm giving it three stars as an average between my previous 4 stars and current two!"}
{"text":"Place has a cool vibe to it.. Upstairs patio seems like it would be packed in the summer.. Nice bar... The ribs here were great."}
{"text":"Long overdue review, as we came here with a group of 5 back in September and they treated us right! 
While the nachos were the weak link of the meal, everything otherwise from the charcuterie to the mains all hit the spot. Rooftop patio is a pretty sweet setup too. 
This place is definitely warrants a visit when in the Queen West hood."}
{"text":"I came here for the Summerlicious menu. Turned out to be one of my best meals in Toronto all year! I started with the antipasto appetizer. The goat milk spread (like butter) was melt in your mouth creamy. There was a lobster and pork based pate, French cheese, sautéed veggies. All were outstanding flavours. I was half full with my appetizer alone!

For main, I had the roasted black cod. The roasted brown flavour was so intense, it tasted almost like braised beef! The mushrooms and peas were a delish addition. And the cod itself was well cooked, crisp exterior and velvet smooth inside.
For dessert I had the cinnamon crème caramel-something between a cheesecake and crème brule. I was so full at this point, I couldn't quite finish the whole thing.
For $25, this meal is solid. I couldn't get over how well everything was flavoured. I was excited to try everything on my plate.

Wondering why I'm giving 4/5 stars instead of 5? Well, the only downfall to my meal was the service. Our main waiter wasn't very friendly, and gave me the impression she did not want to serve us. Particularly at the end, I felt rushed to pay and clear the table, in a timeframe of less than 5min after receiving the bill. But all was not bad, other people bring our food during the evening, were much friendlier. Thank you to the one person who explained what each item was on my antipesto starter . Service does make a difference!"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant was rather dark and shabby. Patio had a rustic, \"hipster\" look to it. We went during the day so we weren't able to fully appreciate the beauty of the restaurant during the evening but our experience was overall, enjoyable. The signature cheese and potato stuffed perogies were so good!! The skin was perfectly crispy on the outside and the inside was just melt in your mouth good. The mayo and red cabbage on the side helped to enhance the perogies. The only criticism that I had would be our server. She was somewhat awkward helping us out. Other than that, I'm looking forward to coming back to try out the sauerkraut and mushroom perogies for our second visit!"}
{"text":"I wish I looked into this place a little more deeply before going there. While most of the reviews are pretty clear that the sign outside is only a weak indication of what lies inside, I wasn't clear just how wide the gap between sign and reality actually was. 

To be honest, there really isn't very much at all at Czehoski that's Czech or Polish or Eastern European. Sure, there was ONE dish on the menu that included pirogi. But let's face it, a single pirogi dish doesn't make you a Polish restaurant any more than french fries make McDonald's French. (Or, if you don't like that example, how about the notion that Jack-in-the-Box is a far cry from Mexico, even though it offers a .99 cent taco.)

So, to the first point, Czehoski's cuisine is hardly unique or interesting. It's relatively standard, regardless of the name, regardless of the reviews, and regardless of how good the food may actually be. 

Add to that the fact that it's crowded, loud and overpriced, and we have the makings of a failure. At this rate, the only thing saving Czehoski in my estimation is the admirable (albeit limited) beer list. Still, my vote is to go to the Korean place next-door, and then stop in to Czehoski's for a night-cap."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious. The food was ok but the portions were sooo small!! My other friend just ordered a burger off their regular menu and got so much more food. I left hungry. Also two of their beers (that we know of) were out. They boast a large beer menu but really... I've been there multiple times and when I try to order a beer somehow they \"just ran out\" of it."}
{"text":"Came to this place after walking over to Harlem Underground and being told that the next seating available is not until 10:30pm.  It was 8:30.  Ordered their sharing board $26 and a few pints.  It was terrible.  The portions were miniscule.  It was almost embarrassing to call it a sharing board.  I'm sorry, I know how much a good kielbasa costs and giving us 3 skinny slices in a board...really??  The Drake's shareable boards puts Czehoski's to shame.  Friend had the soup...we were apprehensive ordering anything else thinking the sharing board could have potentially filled us up.  Not quite, we ended up on Spadina and getting some Chinese to actually get something substantial."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but it's really nothing to write home about.

This restaurant falls into a weird middle space because it's a fine dining restaurant trying to be hip and trendy.  Or perhaps it's a hip and trendy joint that's trying to be fine dining.  I'm never really sure what kind of place I'm in because it's too dark to be fine dining, but too pricey to be a neighbourhood hang out.  

The unfortunate result is that while the food is good, it's not really worth the amount of money you're spending.  

However, it's not all bad.  The best thing about Czehoski is the staff.  Everyone who works there is friendly and relaxed.  I'd say that's the reason this place does as well as it does."}
{"text":"I was there with a group of friends the other weekend. We had a table on the 2nd floor of the restaurant. We ordered a bunch of beer and got their 3$ shot combo with it. Despite the service at the upper bar being extremely slow we where happy to score a table! After sitting for about 15 minutes we were asked to re locate by a young woman and a group of people. We asked if the table was reserved, she responded by telling us that it was her dads restaurant and that she wanted the table since there where no other tables open up or down stairs..... REALLY us paying customers asked to move so daddy's little girl can sit and drink for free. I am truly blown away by the rudeness I like to think customers can make a difference with situations like this. People like her think they can get away with anything just because your dad owns the spot. SO RUDE me and my friends will not be back and are encouraging others to boycott."}
{"text":"it's a good place, if not a little pretentious, but honestly it's fun. good music, good bar, yummy food. i like the pierogies.  there are three main spaces, the front, the back and the upstairs. there is also a patio upstairs which is nice.  the front it fun kitsch, the back is a little more formal/private and upstairs devolves into bar-scene on weekend nights often.  

they have lovely charcuterie and cheeses as well.  definitely a fun time, and a good bar.  they appear to be understaffed which is too bad for all parties, but maybe it's something else...

in general a solid time can be expected, i plan to return with some regularity."}
{"text":"I was here for their $25 Winterlicious meal. I had the caesar salad for my appetizer, the filet mignon for the main course, and the chocolate cake for the dessert.

The salad was decent, but it was nothing to write home about. It's caesar salad - what else do you expect?

The steak was good. They give you two medallions of filet mignon and yes, it is wrapped in BACON. Super tender, succulent, and the portions weren't too bad either. Definitely worth the $25 by itself.

The chocolate cake, like the caesar salad, was run-of-the-mill. I thought it was a bit too sweet, but hey, it's chocolate cake. It's what I paid for.

In summary, I had a pretty decent meal. Would I come here again? Probably not. The meal was good, but not good enough for me to rave about. In all honesty, I'll probably forget that this place exists in a few months."}
{"text":"I love the roof patio on the third floor and also the bar on the first floor. This place has a nice vibe and people here are not pretentious. Good food as well."}
{"text":"Czehoski, the name that just can't roll off your tongue, had for the longest time had me curious about what's inside the place with the weathered peeling original red sign (they really need to do a better job at preserving that sign). Yes, it took a Groupon to joust me here (which they handled quite well), but eh, I'm finally here now at this recognizable Queen West upscale hangout.

It's dark in the back where we sat. But the music isn't loud and the crowd not anywhere as stuck-up yuppie as I thought. Heck, our friendly server was full of humour and delight, upselling wine (how do you run out of all the beer and wine I want early in dinner service?) and remembering I still don't have a clue what the soup of the night was. A good time was had by all.

The aforementioned tomato soup was great and swimming in delectable spices. I also dabbled in their perogies and pan-seared tuna, and it was alrighty. Despite the adopted name and theme, there isn't a lot of anything Polish or eastern European on the menu. But there are a lot of Queen West themed burgers. 

There is an ATM in the basement. And though Czehoski isn't an ideal place to take kids to eat, except maybe in the brunch hours, I did see a server put away a high chair. Just sayin'.

{TTC: the 501er to Palmerston/Tecumseth. Now look up. }"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I went for buck a shuck oysters on a Monday.  They served cascumpec oysters which was a pleasant surprise from carrying malpeque's, which is the usual buck a shuck oyster choice. We had great service and ended up ordering the ribs which were tasty and fell right off the bone. The side veggies and potatoes were soft, moist and packed full of flavor! We were sat right by the open concept kitchen and it was great seeing the chef preparing the food an plating it with so much care. I will go back to try their Mac & Cheese and perogies which they are known for."}
{"text":"I came here last night with the girls.
We were pleasantly greeted, and seated very quickly.  
We ordered crab cakes, the mac and cheese, and the risotto to share.  We loved them all!  We finished the meal with both the rosemary cheesecake and the creme brûlée.  Both were unexpectedly delicious!

I would totally come back, I love the laid-backness and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"We walked into the restaurant and up the stairs to the patio passing many provacative, yet artistic paintings.

It was an awkward minute when everyone on the patio stopped what they were doing and just starred at us.... we were all wearing yoga outfits so I'm not sure what was up.

The server seemed like he didn't care, didn't want to seat us, not even talk to us.. but we managed to get the back table and eventually the umbrella up.

The one word I can describe the experience was slow. Everything took so long, the service, the drink orders, the food... just everything. On saturdays they have $5 caesars / mimosas.. not the famous Czehoski where I heard using red wine in caesars is actually quite good, but a regular caesar, which is still on par.

The french toast with blueberries and chantilly cream was actually quite delicious but I know there are great places with french toast without me feeling awkward and wondering if my food is ever going to show up.

Come back for drinks instead."}
{"text":"When I first entered Czehoski, I was expecting a load of Eastern European food like goulash and sauerkraut used in really interesting ways and a list of beers each more different and exotic than the one before it.  I expected simple plain décor where steins of beer would hit the table and steaming platters of sausage and potatoes would annihilate any space not taken up by the beer mugs.  Once you get past the fact that this is not the case, you're in for a good time.

The décor is decidedly modern and stylish with elegantly printed menus and beer/wine lists.  The list of draft beers does provide Eastern European influence with a list of pints from Belgium (not really 'Eastern' but there's a lot of beers from there), Germany, and Austria as well as local fave Steam Whistle.  I also liked the menu's description of 50 which they also have on tap.  \"Slight fruity taste\", \"hint of hoppiness\", and \"well balanced character\".  Not adjectives normally used to describe it or the folks who drink it.  There's a whack of bottled beers from far off places as well if you fancy.

We were in a rush to get elsewhere so decided against the mains which included spaetzle and pierogies, and settled on true Polish fare; cheeseburgers and poutine.  Not Polish, but very tasty anyway.  When I return with more time (and I will) I'll definitely be trying out the more-European fare.  Unless Quebec truly did steal poutine from the Polish."}
{"text":"I was in the Czech Republic in the dead of winter and stayed in a traditional bohemian lodge with enormous wooden beams and an inviting hearth.  Czehoski has the very same hospitable aesthetic.  Feels just like coming in from the cold.  Dig the canoe hanging above the fireplace."}
{"text":"Downstairs has a dive bar vibe while upstairs is a hip lounge.

The service here is damned good.  They ran out of the beer we wanted and the bartender offered us generous pours on a 'sample' while we were waiting for a table.  Our waiter was awesome - plus he was rocking a fitted that I owned.  Major style points for him.  Extra star for the good service.

But I really can't shake the feeling this place is way overpriced for what you're getting.  I saw all the reviews about their awesome Caesar - being a fan of Caesars (hey, it's not just for ladies), I was tempted.  But holy fuck, $13 for a fuckin' Caesar?  Sure, it might have been so good it was worth it - I watched the bartender chuck in horseradish and top them with wine... but come on, $13 for a fuckin' Caesar?  Get the fuck out of here.  I might be just cheap or 'not understand' -- but even those $12 cocktails at those fancy mixologist bars are too expensive for me.  I'm not paying $13 for what amounts to 2 shots of vodka in Clamato.

The food wasn't bad at all but nothing amazing.  I had the beef ribs (~$22) and crab cakes ($10).

I think what it comes down to here is that you're paying for the 'atmosphere' and it seems like a popular place to bring a date.  The food appears fairly reliable, I guess the downstairs 'dive' bar says you're fun (they had a burlesque show the night I was here) and the upstairs lounge says you have 'class'.  I mean, all the nude paintings upstairs might have a subliminal effect?

If I didn't know better and I was younger, I might have brought a date here.  But of course, if my date called out this place for what it is: overpriced and a tad pretentious -- I might have to put a ring on it."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant Saturday night at Czehoski. The service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was cozy, sophisticated, and welcoming. There is some beautiful art up right now by Todd Monk, so that was an added bonus. Although we had a good experience, I am sticking to 3 stars because the food was just so so. The mac and cheese and garden burger were bland, and the Palmerston burger was nothing special. Delicious fries though! I would give this place 5 stars as a place to grab drinks and snacks with friends, just not dinner."}
{"text":"bad service, bad drinks. didn't even bother with the food."}
{"text":"Czehoski is kind of a misleading place. It's billed as a Polish restaurant, but the only Polish on the menu is the pierogis. It's billed as comfort food/gastropub, but the mac & cheese and burgers are not stellar. What it really is is a Queen West establishment. Most of the people who frequent Czehoski, myself included, come because it's hip, trendy and good for people watching (even if you don't know who you're looking at). There are always whispers that one of the magnificent duo of Kenny & Spenny (we never know which one) is somewhere inside. Come for the atmosphere and delicious mixed drinks. Don't delude yourself that you're paying for overpriced homecooked meals.

I recently dropped in for an early dinner and had a great experience. The place gets loud ~8pm on weekends, so be sure to book it if you like eating quietly. Each floor has its own features. The main floor is cozy and comfortable with the raised booths, the second floor showcases the fireplace and beautiful canoe, and the third is basically the patio, which is a delightfully intimate space for anyone wanting to get away from the dirt of the city. 

My memory of the dishes I've eaten over the years is pretty strong, so here's a quick summary: 

Beef Poutine - Delicious! The cheddar curds are not squeaky like one would get in Quebec or at Poutinis, but it's a tasty gravy (not oversalted or runny) and great proportions. 

Blue Crab Cakes - I love the addition of pickled ginger in these crab cakes, though on occasion they have been dry. They are also a bit small, so don't count on this as a substitute for a main. 

Salmon Carpaccio - This was a seasonal item and done totally right. Rich Atlantic salmon with an excellent lemony tang. 

Czehoski Burger - This burger comes with a hefty amount of frites and can leave you very full. The jalapeno works well. Mustard and ketchup come on a spoon. 

Turkey Burger - My friend swears by this burger, stating something ridiculous like it's better than Utopia. I've heard the spicy aioli is to die for. 

Mac n Cheese - I love this. There are other places in the city that do gourmet mac & cheese, but this one is my staple. The portion is filling and the taste is amazing.  Goes well with a good IPA or wine. Don't flinch at the price and think you could make this at home. 

Blue Crab Claw Mac n Cheese - I ordered this once and thought it wasn't worth the $7 premium on the basic mac & cheese. Blue crab is best enjoyed fresh and alone, and I find the mac & cheese distracting. 

Pierogis - Yes, your oma makes it better. We all know that, but does she come downtown ever? I love the sweet potato and have tried to replicate this, but failed miserably. This dish is filling, despite its small size. Totally yummy. 

Angus Beef Ribs - These beef ribs are massive! The braised kale and smashed potatoes are an excellent side to it. I love this dish for a hearty rainy night with a nice glass of red. 

As for drinks, you can count on all the mixed drinks to use Zubrowka if they have vodka in it. Zubrowka is delicious, especially with something tart like apple sourz. The teacher's pet is a solid cocktail. Right now they are also serving a hot cider with Zubrowka and mulled wine as part of their warm drinks. Both hit the spot on a cold windy day."}
{"text":"This review is not for the restaurant, but for my bar experience.

Went with a friend around 6pm; downstairs was full so we went on upstairs. I actually like the upstairs bar a lot more! It even has a working fireplace. You can also venture outside to their fairly large patio if it's nice outside.

Fairly standard draft beers with average prices for Queen West."}
{"text":"First time dining at this establishment on Queen W, and if you are looking for a amazing venue with sour service staff, poor time management and an under stocked bar look no further! 
We specifically went to this restaurant because of their drink special on Wednesday, which is half priced bottles of wine. I ordered 1 bottle to begin to split with 2 other friends, however when I asked for another one the server responded \"Sure\" and then didn't return for 15 minutes. I asked again and she said \"Like I told you we are out of all white wines.\" Needless to say the tone and response was brutal enough for me not to care what the reason was why they were out of WINE ON WINE NIGHT! The Sassy server continued to treat all guests in my party with little to no respect! The only credit I can give this restaurant is the food is actually decent and the upstairs patio is worth checking out."}
{"text":"It's hard to start a restaurant.   You require a wide range of specialized kitchen machinery, top line ingredients and well-educated culinary artists.

Or you just buy a deep fryer and toss everything in it.

Czehoski falls into the second category.

At first, you're seduced by the well-written menu complete with hipster typefaces and broadsheet paper.    But then you realize that the whole \"never judge a book by it's cover\" adage falls true.   

Food here is absolutely terrible.    It's a deep fried mess served on enriched white bread with little thought given to presentation or substance.   

The crab cakes sounded wonderful.  An eloquently written blurb about the sourcing of these blue crab morsels of deliciousness suckered me in.  I felt ready to explore the sea, harpoon in hand.   Oh, how I long for the smell of saltwater and the rush of the ocean.  Call me Ishmael!   At ten dollars a pop, this was completely embarrassing.   I have to admit that I was looking on the plate for remnants of the filet-o-fish wrapper that they clearly repackaged as crab cakes.   

My beautiful dining companion chose to go for the \"Smoked Bean Dip\" which definitely had the smoked flavor that they described in the menu.  In fact, it was like eating beans out of an ashtray.  Equally horrid.

The word Quinoa seems to be the buzzword of our times.    I'm used to it meaning a type of whole-grain.  Clearly there's another interpretation of the word that refers to deep fried grizzle slop.    The Quinoa-based veggie burger was just that.  1500 calories of batter, breading and bastardization.    At one point, I turned to my dining companion and just made disgusted muppet faces.

Sure, the drinks were good.  Sure, the piano player was a nice touch.  Sure, there was eye-candy and hipster types.

But the service was horribly slow, the water constantly awaited refilling, and the food was absolutely atrociously horrible."}
{"text":"The night before I finally ventured to Czehoski -- a place whose European grass roots sign I had been admiring for years -- I had vivid dreams of vertically challenged men marching down the aisles of the place carrying strands of sausages over their shoulders -- so long they were dragging on the floor.

But when I walked into Czehoski, there was not even a greasy dripping leftover from my dream and I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere.  Unlike many Toronto restaurants, Czehoski has an inviting, warm feeling to it, possibly because of its predominantly brick interior, or perhaps because the spot has been handed down from generation  to generation and carries with it a subtle yet glowing familial pride.

I only had drinks upstairs on the patio, so I can't recommend the food but the oysters looked really good and the French 75 was a refreshing, serious cocktail."}
{"text":"A cool lounge semi dressy place chill local scene.. 

I came here because of YELP. This place had some interesting positive reviews and I thought I go see for myself. 

We ordered the steak with frites ($21) and their czehoski burger with caramelized onions ($15). Overall it was pretty good. The steak came out in cut portions and came out like I wanted medium rare. The frites was good nicely salty =)    The burger was decent. With $2 dollars extra for caramelized onions they were a little shady in adding that.. Good selection in beers. 

It is on the Queen St. so I will be able to find it easily. I came to this restaurant during CMW (Canadian Music Week). They had a few local performer playing. We only stayed for the first act, and it was really good blues just a little loud to enjoyi my dinner. 

Good overall experience at this place. I really like this local venue."}
{"text":"- Best Bison tartare I've ever had. (Well, it was my first raw buffalo, but I was totally channeling Dancing With Wolves). 

- The poutine was salty goodness to the last drop of gravy. 

- Cauliflower and parsnip soup brought new meaning to the word \"veloute\". 

For all the naysayers, the atmoshere (candles, multi-levels, almost '20s feel, genuine TO, pation) really can't be topped, and the food quality was excellent. 

Great, reasonable wines by the glass, as well. 

And a $5 cab ride to Parkdale."}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated spot for sure - worth going just to check it out.
The food was good but not as tasty as I had expected."}
{"text":"Good: Wait staff is great. Food is good but can be a hit or miss on the specials - I have eaten here one a month for the past year. Steak frites and burger are always a winner. I have had friends enjoy the mac and cheese. 

Ok: They need a bigger beer list!! And not to tease us with the possibilities of beer. And they need more apps on their menu. It is great that they have gluten free stuff but your choices are still limited to meat and cheese."}
{"text":"We were directed here by a local store owner and we had a delicious dinner! The warm olive starter was interesting, spicy and unique, and the mussels were awesome!! Yummy fries accompanied a filling and fresh pork schnitzel. Our waiter was brand new and delightful and the vibe was friendly and relaxed. A nice treat!"}
{"text":"I found the service to be average and the food and cocktails to be overpriced. $17 for 6 potato/cheese perogies? Could not bring myself to order them. Burger was just average.  Extremely limited vegetarian options. I do not recommend this place for vegetarians. 
The feel of this place is very nice and I think that's what you end up paying for and not the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Celebration dinner last week for Sarah T & her new gig as multimedia social networking interactive more buzz words here director for WXN TV.  I'm just kidding, I'm not making fun.  (I am).

The great:
The girls who work here gave Sarah T dating advice.

The good:
- my burger was good.  They make the buns there and it had red onions, which are my favorite onions.  Fries were top notch.
- the beer selection was small, but mostly good beers
- there is a page of gluten free stuff if you need that
- Like the vibe here... casual but classy and lots of wood throughout
- I actually don't remember why this place was so good but I remember I had a REALLY good time
- staff was great
- music was great and not too loud

The bad:
- The menu was limited.  There wasn't much outside of the burger that I would have really considered ordering.
- The appetizers are expensive.  Our hummus/cheese/olives thing was $17.
- I didn't *love* my mixed drink.  

I will definitely go here again.  I had a really good time, loved the space, great staff, top notch french fries... I mean... how could I not go here again."}
{"text":"I was at Czehoski for a friend's birthday dinner and the service was just awful.  We waited an hour and a 1/2 for our food, which is simply unacceptable (especially given the fact that we had made a reservation a week in advance).  They eventually brought us popcorn to snack on as we waited, but that wasn't until we'd been waiting over an hour. Popcorn simply wasn't going to appease us.

I would suggest going here for a drink, but the food really wasn't anything to write home about (once we finally got it).  I had the perogies and they were fine, but I have no clue why it took them 90 minutes to get them to me. Ridiculous. It's just cheese and potatoes, people! Speed it up!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and unique. The service is hit or miss. At Winter/Summer(can't remember)-licious it was really great. Another time it was so bad, the guy even said something rude as I left. I like this place for the meat and potatoes, served all ways."}
{"text":"Great appetizers! Ordered the braised beef rib poutine & hot wings! Both were very good! Wings were very spicy! They have a disclaimer for those ordering suicide (no complaints, no refunds & no returns) 
Entrees were bland and not worth the $23.95! Had the pan seared tuna with potato rosti and the jerk chicken with rice & habanero sauce...
Tuna - was over cooked and very fishy! No sauce! And the only veg that came with was a few sprinkles of what looked like parsley

Chicken - crispy and dry, rice was the highlight of the dish, it indicated habanero sauce but maybe they forgot the sauce? 

Both dishes were dry and sauce less!"}
{"text":"Fun bar with multiple levels, but the key here is the rooftop patio in the summer.

I've been a few times now. Pleasant staff, decent drink deals (1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays, hey!) and an interesting food menu. I've only sample the perogies before but they were good!

My date tried some kind of Polish beer and seemed well impressed with it. 

Cool place if you happen to be in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Terrible service with average food. This hipster hell hole is not worth the visit."}
{"text":"They have some strong and delicious cocktails. The Caesars are some of the best I've ever had. They are spicy and lack the pulpy consistency of tomato juice. I also liked a coconut water and vodka mix I tried here recently. The name escapes me. 

They have many different seating areas for people of varying levels of sociability. Larger groups sit on the first floor. Couples and smaller groups sit on the second. There is the patio which will suit different purposes depending on the the season. The third floor (more like a balcony) is tiny and barren on most nights. If you are seeking extra intimacy or like drinking in solitude, check it out.    

I find the second floor to be way too dark during the evening. You are always relying on a flimsy candle that is constantly going out with a breath. I can appreciate the romanticism but I like to be able to see what I'm eating or who I'm sitting across. 

The food is pricey. The service is good."}
{"text":"I held a UYE here during Yelp Eats week. Compared to the other restaurants I visited that week, this one wasn't all that impressive. Overall it was fine, but nothing would really make me jump at the opportunity to come back here.

I had the mac & cheese. It was tasty but definitely not worth the extra cash to get the sausage on it. You get a few thin pieces, I would have expected a healthy amount for the price you pay.

The service was fine, nothing over the top or anything to complain about. As the night went on we started to get crowded out at our table as a large group arrived and thought it would be a good idea to stand around instead of sitting at their table.

Meh."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I wish the food that serves at Czehoski can be better...

I love the set up: Nice huge patio at the back, high ceiling with the view of Queen West on the second floor, dive bar vibe at the first floor

I love the staffs here, though I got confused with which one was my waiter as they all dressed alike... my coupon was welcomed with no issue at all.. Great services.

I wish the food can be better....

We shared:

Beet Salad ($10) - decent 
Blue Crab Cakes ($11) - best dish of the evening
Russet Frites ($5) - fries..
Crab Mac n Cheese ($19) - so salty.. I taste nothing but salt... what a waste 
of the ingredients

I might come back to Czehoski for a drink but will pass on the food. But there are so many cool places for drinks in the area..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Palmerston burger. Thought burgers were the specialty here. Mine sucked.

Service was glacial (pace-wise)."}
{"text":"I just attended a funeral in Buffalo for my Godmother and decided to come to Toronto balance out the life and death equation. It brought much needed balance. I had some great conversations with Uncle Mark about Chicago in the 70's and 80's and his many fights against the street gang known as the Insane Unknowns. I come from a family of proud Polish people and after hanging out with the clan I was feeling a great connection with my brethren. I saw a sign that read \"Czehoski\" and knew I had to saunter in. This is exactly the opposite of the Polish bars I am used to. I am a member of Roosevelt Veterans Post #58 Polish Club in Cleveland, OH. 

http://plavpost58.blogspot.com/

Czehoski was a culture shock. The bartender was beautiful though and enchanting. The bartender at Post 1 in Cleveland is an old Polish man with no legs so this little lady barmaid at Czehoski is a welcome change. A dude came up to me and asked if I preferred Samsung or Apple phones. I told him Samsung and clearly that is the case because I had my phone sitting on the bar. He then asked \"So what is your angle? Are you trying to get picked up?\" to which I replied \"I just buried my Godmother and am wandering around\" which gave him the answer in a roundabout way."}
{"text":"Went here on a groupon one night.
I liked this place for the food and that's it.
I didn't like the small beer selection they had nor did I like our service.
We arrived and at first the host said \"there's no reservation under that name\" My friend even said she got a confirmation callback later that day stating everything was set for 8:30pm.
The host simply said \"sorry, you're not here, don't know what to tell you\" My friend asked him then to find us a table. He just took another long look at all of us then said \"ugh, i'll see what i can do\" I was like really. About 30 seconds later, the owner comes to us and says \"we have your table all ready\" I think the host could have done a waaaayyy better job of accomodating us. Thank god for the owner though.

So we sit down to order our drinks and our food and such which came out at almost a snails pace. Our dinner took 3 hours but could have been shortened if the waiter didn't take so darn long. It may have been a busy night but honestly, our food took for-------ev---errr.

Conclusion:
 Food - 3 ***
 Service - 1***

Would I come back. If they got better staff or trained the ones they have to be better, then yes. I've come here on their patio and although it's a good patio, drinks take awhile to receive."}
{"text":"What's not to love? The staff is friendly, the food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is cosy and convivial. So far, I've enjoyed the chorizo mac and cheese, the flawless risotto, the amazing pierogies, and the veggie burger -- all winners. DIY cupcakes made an appearance during my last visit: a trio of cute cupcakes you can frost to your hearts content. This place is a gem.

Obligatory Title Pun: CZE-CK it out!

Menu Readability: A tidy and well-put-together book dividing lunch, dinner and drinks. Very elegant.

Need to mention: I reluctantly mention their brilliant patio, because it's a bitch finding space there in the summer. Keep away.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm selfish!"}
{"text":"So this month I've been to Czehoski twice, after so many years of hearing about it and wanting to try it. The first time was a pretty good time, we went on a Friday night and the place was packed it was in the lineup so you didn't have to wait. The DJ was spinning mishmash of different tunes that all were from different genres but somehow it just worked. We got there for drinks and we sat upstairs. The service was good and they have beer specials everyday. I ordered a Cesar but I think the waiter brought me a normal Caesar and not the one that is topped off with red wine, so disseizor wasn't very good because it was too diluted. Otherwise the ambience on the second floor was quite nice because they had the fireplace that was going and it was dimly lit creating a very intimate atmosphere. The significant other ordered a beer and was happy with that because there's nothing too complex about that order really. We didn't order any food but the menu looked pretty appetizing and so we wanted to go back to try it it's eventually for dinner.

This brings me to tonight when I went there for dinner with a friend. We each had two drinks and we ordered dinner there. For drinks I finally Got to try to Cesar with the red wine and I have to say that I was a bit underwhelmed, The flavor profile just wasn't what I thought was going to be and it was only garnished with two small pimento filled olives and a slice of lime. I definitely had better Caesar's elsewhere. For dinner, I got the crab Mac & cheese for $19 and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with what I got for the price. It was definitely dried pasta and the crowd did not taste like it was fresh Crab meat, it tasted like it was canned, and the sauce was grainy and had this weird clumpy texture. it just wasn't very good because the flavor of the crab overtook the dish and it just wasn't balanced at all. My friend got the perogies which he said were okay but he's had better at other places like Shanghai cowgirl. The perogies came on a plate of six, take a look at the picture, for $20. That's a lot to pay for So few pierogies. Otherwise the service was okay throughout the meal. The highlight of the night was the desert which we were told changes on a daily basis. The desert for the night that we ordered was freshly baked chocolate and walnut cookies and on the side of them we got burdened jellies and whiskey sour jellies which were both House made and these were very good and tasted like what they sounded like. The cookies were warm and really well-made and definitely the one thing that I had that I would go back for."}
{"text":"I was here a pretty long time ago but I have always remembered loving it.  Came here for beers and small plates with coworkers on a work trip from NY. Chilling on the rooftop patio and eating fried calf brains with absinthe...somehow thats my kind of afternoon!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  The food is not bad, but not great either and the portions are small.  I love the decor of the second floor and the rooftop patio (although it can get a bit stuffy in the summer because it's surrounded by walls and it doesn't let in any breezes)  The staff are hit or miss.  The waiter that I had forgot our order and seemed like a d-bag at first, but then after turned out to be super cool.  

Side note: apparently they hand cut all their fries here.  

In a nutshell: variable."}
{"text":"I hear about this place all the time, pass it often, get invites to events there, but somehow had never made it there until last night.

Drinks alone are $12 and beers are at least $5.50, out of my price range. My friend and I settled on the crême brulée. We had been in search of dessert anyway.

This was the most delicious crême brulée I have ever had IN MY LIFE. I felt kind of guilty to be sitting in Czehoski and eating a dessert but after I had one bite, I didn't care. I couldn't sit still because it was so delicious.

If you want to know what bliss is, it is a bite of crême brulée. Trust me."}
{"text":"After a nice late night meal here, I'm going to eat some crow and update my review. 

The fries, Hunter's stew and pierogies were all excellent and really hit the spot. The stew was an especially nice surprise, very hearty and plentiful with a rich broth and toast. 

I Previously was too hard on the food here, or they've really turned it around. Either way, check it out!  

I still can't effing spell their name..."}
{"text":"SIgh. I went here on just this past Thursday after wanting to try this place for AGES.

I didn't mind the draught beer selection for the most part. The menu probably showed 10 beers but at least three of them they were out of. Bummer #1.

My date wasn't grabbing any food but I was famish having come right from work. I had always heard good things about the food here from friends and word of mouth. I decided to go with something basic and tasty... mac and cheese. Biggest regret and bummer #2, I definitely got food poisoning from the mac and cheese. Not pretty. 

To say the least, I probably won't come back as I'm scared for life..."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years, and then last week ran into a friend in front of it so we decided to roll in and catch up.

It turns out summerlicious was on so we figured why not.  It was dead empty and so we managed to score a super bad ass spot on their patio. Their patio is so comfy and awesome that I can't recommend it enough. Definitely check it out if you ever get the chance.

The summerlicious food itself was decent. I really enjoyed the crab cakes and the steak that I had, but the salad was pretty plain. My desert was also way too sweet for me, but I don't really have a sweet tooth.

Service was excellent at the beginning, but at the end it took quite a while to get our deserts and then the bill after."}
{"text":"On Sat 2014-03-01, two of us went for dinner at 5:00-6:30pm. This time we used a groupon (paid $36 for up to $76 worth - 2 appetizers and 2 mains). We can order from their regular menu (unlike some other groupons).

We had a table on their second floor (didn't even know they had a second floor!). The ground floor was darker but the 2nd floor had plenty of light (more windows). There is a rooftop patio but I didn't have a look. The waitress was very pleasant and service was good. 

This time the portions were huge (unlike the Winterlicious portions which were small - we only paid $25/p for a Winterlicious dinner).  The food was very tasty and well presented.  See my new photos.

Didn't have dessert because we were very full (had to take the unfinished food home). But the desserts the waitress told us didn't sound captivating (or else I might have been tempted)."}
