{"text":"Pretty decent Thai food. I always just go for pickup, food is ready quick and it's delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Must try the spaghetti pad ki and Crispy pork belly. Food is good every time I have ordered from here, which is quite frequently. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant, quite hard to find. My friends and I got the pad see ew and it's has a lot of flavours. We also got the tom yum soup and if you don't like spicy,I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a lingering spice but a little kick. My favourite would be the Penang curry, it has rice on the side and it was perfect! Has a peanut taste to it but still that curry aroma.  The atmosphere of the restaurant isn't that quite nice. It was SOOO HOT in there, as we were eating we were all sweating. Asked the manager to turn on the AC and he said it is on, but felt like a sauna in there. Only downfall. Food is great but they need to fix their AC.  The service itself is great. Servers were all so polite and nice! The food also came out really quick."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Yummy authentic food, great staff! Not too pricey. The mains were a good size, both of us finished them, and had the mango rice pudding for dessert and it was amazing! Would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai cuisine minutes from where I live! A real godsend! Friendly and speedy service. Amazing food. Make sure you download their app and collect points for free items! Provide delivery for a fee as well."}
{"text":"Nice little place on yonge. Okay seating; service is great; food tastes good, food portion is big. Limited parking at the front."}
{"text":"We stepped in 30 mins before closing time, and weren't allowed to dine in. The waiter's explanation was the kitchen is closing soon, but we can still get takeout. How does that make any sense? Food is decent, but this kind of service should not be encouraged."}
{"text":"We visited for lunch because we were craving for some Thai food and saw that this place had some great reviews. However, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of customer service. I ordered a chicken pad thai but when the food was ready, they served me shrimp pad thai. I brought it up to my server that this was not my order. The individual who took my order insisted that I ordered shrimp rather than chicken. The tone and attitude towards customers was extremely patronizing and rude! I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! As good as in Bangkok itself. Friendly, fast service. Great options and totally authentic, delicious food! The art work on the wall is hand drawn by the owner, it's awesome... you'll learn a bit about Bangkok and Thai food! Must go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Picked up a few take-out items since we were in the area and saw the reviews for this place. Food reminded me of Pai Thai Restaurant downtown - ordered Pad Thai and chicken green curry, both for take-out. Delicious, flavourful and prices were reasonable - would order again if in the area."}
{"text":"Food: This place has the most flavorful and authentic Thai food I have ever tasted. I experienced a full range of flavors with every bite from the freshness of peanuts and basil in my salad to the spicy sensation from the spices in curry and meat dishes. Their Morning Glory salad is amazingly crisp and very tasty. Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes.  Service: Our waiter gave us some good recommendations for ordering. She was attentive and friendly.   Atmosphere: It's fun and casual with chalk doodles on the walls. There are few tables, so I recommend making reservations. The seating is tight, I would not recommend for families with young kids."}
{"text":"Delicious food, efficient service and friendly staff.  Their lunch special is very worth it. I got a small bowl of soup that came right after placing the order. The main dish came out shortly after. I had Basil crispy pork. It was delicious. Highly recommend this place. I will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Visited BKK after hearing many glowing reviews and were not disappointed! While the restaurant itself is small, we were thoroughly impressed with the menu selections and very hospitable staff. We started off with Veggie Fresh Rolls which were very fresh and had the most amazing accompanying peanut sauce I've had in ages. One person in our group ordered the Kao Soi Siam and customized it without the regular sauce (wanted no MSG) and the chef made to order a version with coconut milk only that pleased our health nut a lot! And he's usually very picky! Two people shared a chicken and shrimp pad Thai and both said it was the best pad Thai they'd ever had. I ordered the Fried Morning Glory and it was incredible!! Craving it again already, especially the peanut/vinegar sauce. Soooo delicious!! We ordered everything mild as we had heard it can be to spicy and everything was perfect. You can get takeout here and delivery through Uber Eats. Overall, we were blown away with the food and service and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When this place opened up next to my condo, I was excited, but cautiously optimistic. Well I've gone twice now, and I can't believe the best Thai restaurant in the city is right next door to me! This is gonna be dangerous :)  The food is very authentic Thai, and it's done right. I've been eating Thai food for a long time now and have been to Thailand multiple times, the food at BKK is on point  The portions are fairly large, with lots of protein, and I find the prices to be fair (but not cheap) The service however, is my favourite part. They're all Thai and so friendly.  DEEP FRIED MORNING GLORY This is my favourite dish at the restaurant. Crispy and lightly tempura battered morning glory leaves are topped with a sweet/sour papaya salad (Som Tum). This dish encompasses everything Thai food is all about. The flavour balance of sweet, salty, sour and a tad spicy, along with the texture contrast, fried crispy leaves with a soft and tender papaya salad. I'll be craving this one  KHAO SOI My second favourite dish here, this Khao Soi is done right. Really not sure how an above poster called it \"bland\", any more flavour might even be overpowering. The soft egg noodles are swimming in a rich coconut curry broth, topped with crunchy egg noodles and garnished with the required pickled mustard greens and raw red onion, it is so comforting and delicious. I've had it twice but only with beef. The beef is in big tender chunks and not fatty at all. Cannot speak to the chicken option. Love love love this. (PS watch your spicy level, if you  PAD THAI Good portion size. Authentic and delicious. No ketchup to be found here. It is saucy but not overly so. They're not reinventing the wheel here, just a good, proper Pad Thai. My wife loves it  RED CURRY CHICKEN A very tasty coconut and red curry \"gravy\" with tender chunks of chicken (beef and shrimp is also an option) with pieces of veggies and sweet/sour pineapple to cut through the richness of the curry sauce. Very well balanced and great over steamed jasmine rice. This is the only dish I had that I feel could be improved upon. Could use some more lemongrass and a stronger kaffir lime leaf flavour, but I'm splitting hairs here, the dish was done within minutes.   TOM YUM GOONG The famous Thai lemongrass soup with shrimp, it is one of my favourite examples in Toronto. Big juicy prawns, mushrooms and tomato in a slightly red lemongrass broth. I liked this Tom Yum because it is a slight bit creamy, and not fully clear (I assume they used a bit of coconut milk) .....very flavourful and spicy    CHICKEN SATAY SKEWERS  5 nice sized chicken skewers come served on a bed of peanut satay sauce with a little dressed salad on the side. Decent portion for the price, but will probably save my belly for some other menu options next time.   If you're looking for a trendy hangout spot to have drinks and chill, this is not the place for you. If you want damn delicious Thai food eat in/takeout, decent prices and very good service, then you will love BKK. Now if you'll excuse me, I still have some Khao Soi leftovers in the fridge...."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got this many stars. Came for dinner one night. Perhaps an off night but one we experienced  1) service was slow 2) food came slow 3) service quality was ok for an Asian restaurant. I saw two other parties get poor service. 4) they ran out of their curry puffs and ran out of mango sticky rice. How can they have run out of those things so early in the evening? 5) no ac, but super fans blowing  Food: decent"}
{"text":"This Thai place is exactly what this neighborhood (which is saturated with noodle places) needs. The food is delicious, the flavor blow your mind. And the service is impeccable. I go here atleast once a week. Yes it is small, but I love that charming aspect."}
{"text":"Have been here for dinner and for lunch. Can't beat the $10 lunch specials. Mango salad w chicken satay is my go to for something light. Comes with soup and spring roll. Flavours are great. Tom Yum soup has delicious complex favours, not just one note. Not too sweet. Not too sour. Could drink it all night.  Sticky rice w mango for dessert is not to be missed, so make room. So happy they have Eat BKK in the neighbourhood. Limited parking. Best to have reservations. Always business, esp during lunch hour."}
{"text":"This is a new place but I've already been here several times. I really enjoyed my first couple of visits and the food was excellent, however, in just a matter of a few weeks the customer service has gone down substantially. They no longer seem to care what level of spice you want the food and make everything mild, the staff are always rushed and today I stopped by to pick up a green curry only to find they won't customize at all anymore. I asked for brocolli instead of green peppers and the woman at the counter looked at me like I was crazy and then said 'Wait, you want to substitute?' Then she yelled something in the back, came back and said 'No, they can't do that.' I told her that's how I always get it every time and she just said 'The chef said no.' From the lack of spice and the now non customizable menu, I can only assume that they are now just mass producing the curries and adding whatever meat/tofu option the customer chooses. This combined with the service really takes away from the food and the overall enjoyment of the place. It's too bad because I had been planning to make this a regular spot despite the stuff location and the lack of air conditioning."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food I tried pork fries veggies  with rice and eggs on top really delicious and slightly spicy.    The staff were very friendly and the service was good. My food was ready quickly. The place is l small but has clean and modern atmosphere. I agree with other ratings and would recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot  for authentic Thai finally in North York! Had the Pad Thai and Panang and both were great. Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered off of UberEATS. Usually this place is really fast and reliable. Decent prices for decent food. However, this time I ordered the Pad Krapao Kai Dao Sam Yan and halfway through the meal I find a DEAD FLY in my food!! Unacceptable and completely gross. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this place once in person and twice as delivery and every time was delicious and fresh.   Get the milk roti, it was delicious and crispy.   I really enjoy the pad see ewe, it's simple and fresh. The pad Thai is also very good. I have yet to try the khao soi but that will be my next test when I go in person. Those who tried the mango salad said this was also really exceptional. I can't wait to go back again. Even writing this is making me want to go again today."}
{"text":"The food tended to be on the sweet side across all of our dishes, and it wasn't as balanced as it could be.   We tried the following: -chicken satay skewers (tender, very sweet peanut sauce--not sure I was a fan of the sauce) -chicken wings (very fragrant and crisped well) -pad thai (veg option-a little wet in terms of when it came out, I ordered a few limes to bring out the tanginess) -crispy pork kai dao (savoury and slightly spicy; my sister personally enjoyed the hardness of the skin -- probably one of the better balanced dishes amongst what we ordered) -green curry (chicken option - a bit too sweet as a curry for us; we liked the tamarind quality in it but we could have used better balance)  came out to over $70 for 3 people."}
{"text":"My new favourite Thai place. Everything we've ordered so far has been good. We usually get take out, and they tend to throw in extra spring rolls or rice which I appreciate."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was delicious! As was the curry and the pad thai. Everything tasted yummy.   Came during lunch when it was slammed and our meals miraculously came out quick. Super impressed! Kutos to the friendly staff! It is not an easy thing to pull off during a rush.   The place was smokin hot b/c of the heat wave and constant open door, it added to the feel of being in Bangkok, lol.   Would recommend and will definitely come back! Looking forward to trying all the other dishes."}
{"text":"The food was so good! The quality and taste was great. Service was also pleasant! We ordered Penang curry, pad Thai (very good) and a couple of other dishes. Great for families with kids too."}
{"text":"Really awesome place! Food was really amazing everything my partner and I had didnt disappoint. The owner himself came and talked to us asking how we knew about them and all and thanked us for coming! After we tried he asked us our opinion and it was really nice. The waitress was really nice.  We got the chicken padthai, masaman curry beef spring rolls, hot and sour soup and a thai iced tea (one of the best)"}
{"text":"On a Friday afternoon, I slipped into the restaurant to enjoy a bowl of Khao Soi. The waiters were friendly and I got to choose a table of my choice since there weren't a lot of people. My bowl of Khao Soi came after a five minute wait. Overall, the service was good.  The large bowl came with a beautiful golden broth, a lime, chunks of tender beef, and crispy noddles. At first, I was a bit disappointed by how the broth wasn't as rich as the other restaurants (Pai & Sabai Sabai). But I realized this not-so-rich broth was actually perfect. After a few more bites, I realized I can eat this Khao Soi more often since it wasn't too rich. Only downfall would be the large spices (such as star anise) that I accidentally bit into.   I give this place a 4/5. This khao soi is perfect if you wish to eat this often. I wish the large spices weren't in the broth. I also which there was a Khao Soi lunch special - a smaller portion and cheaper price?"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, especially the curry ! The place is small as well as the parking. The lunch special is a great deal !  But unfortunately the service here is less than acceptable! I order from here very often however I might look for another place in my neighbourhood as I feel very unappreciated not just the service I received today but on he past also. The food is delicious!! Maybe I'll stick to delivery !? If you don't mind being treated poorly in exchange for good food... go here. Also they have a good loyalty card system on their app."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered thai iced tea, tom yum soup, khao soi poutine, pad kraprao kai dao, and mango sticky rice. Iced tea and soup were perfection. The beef in the poutine was this soft brisket type and the curry was coconut based yumminess. My boyfriend didnt like his pad kraprao as much because it was too plain for him but I thought it tasted good- not oily, not too spicy, and especially great with the curry from the poutine. Mango sticky rice was soft and fresh. Wish the rice was slightly less sweet though. Ignoring the poutine, everything else tasted like authentic Thai from Thailand.    Service: Despite not being that busy at 8pm+, service was a little slow but server was nice and actually Thai.  Environment: Small but clean shop. Maybe six tables, five or so seats by the wall. Cute drawings on the wall.  To the owners: please install a curtain by the door. Everytime the door opened, cold wind came in. :(  So besides that it took a little long for the food, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend I found this place right across the street from her place and went to try it. It's a small place, but the decors inside were pretty interesting and unique.  I ordered a pad Thai and my girlfriend ordered a curry (forgot which one). The pad Thai was pretty good. Not super oily and is definitely one of the better ones in uptown. The curry was alright though. It was very watery and sweet. It was good but not what we were expecting.   Main reason for 4 stars would be the price. The menu has price for each dishes, but you have to add 2.50-3.50 to add meat/shrimp. So it ends up becoming around $15 plus tip and tax. The portions are pretty decent, but it felt a little expensive"}
{"text":"This place is busy. It's a hole in the wall with limited parking. The food is decent. Not the most amazing Thai food, but it's decent for the price and around the area.   Order take out ahead of time to save hassle. Cash has discount price I believe. There's limited seating especially for big groups."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband and teenage daughter.  Parking was convenient, right in front.  The restaurant was very busy with a lot of take out customers coming in and out.  We ordered 2 appetizers which came out very quickly.  The chicken satay was cold and over-cooked.  For the main dishes, we ordered the tofu pad thai and red chicken curry with pineapple.  The Red Curry was very tasty and the pineapple deliciously sweet.  Again the dish was not served hot.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This establishment is conveniently located down the street from my work.   Came in here for dinner and was superised to see how small it was physically - but how busy it was.  The amount of people than came in and out was insane.  Started off with a Thai iced tea - one of the best I've ever had.  Had green curry for dinner- it was okay, nothing special but the Pad Thai was delicious!!!! Definitely something I'd come back for.  The place seemed to be very authentic, and the server seemed to have A lot of knowledge about Thai culture. It was pretty  cool!"}
{"text":"The dining area is on the smaller side, it's clean, and feels comfortable. The servers were kind however, getting their attention sometimes took a little time. I ordered the red curry which was very tasty. On the other hand, the shrimp chips were not good, they tasted stale and smelt funky. I think the restaurant is giving it as a free check-in reward because they're trying to get rid of their stash that they regret buying. Haha. The location is convenient, right off the 401, and they have a small parking area. Would most likely come back for the red curry and to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch at this restaurant this afternoon based on the review. The food was okay, but the service was terrible. I placed a takeout order, didn't receive the spring rolls which was part of the order; only noticed after I got back to the office. When I picked up the order, I asked if there was utensils in the bag, the waiter said yes. Reaching the car, I noticed that there was no utensils went back in again and asked for utensils. The customer service dropped as soon as the waiter noticed that I hadn't tipped, didn't tip because it was a takeout order. Definitely, not worth the visit again."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now and gotten the lunch specials. For $11, you get two spring rolls, soup and a main. And let me tell you, the portion sizes are great!! I usually take two rounds to eat my main. Always delicious and quick as well. Would definitely recommend, I'll be coming back more and more."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for the past few months. It's clean and the food comes out fast and the lunch prices are good. Parking lot is tiny and packed during busy hours so keep that in mind. I like that they utilize both mobile app as well as the usual crowdsourcing delivery options (JustEat, foodora, etc). Always nice to pre-order your food on your phone on the way there.   I usually get the green curry or pad Thai chicken specials but today I decided to try their Basil Pork Belly lunch special and was really disappointed.  The pork belly was rock hard and fatty bits were impossible to chew that I had to throw it out and just eat the rice and veggies. And I am the type to clean my plate even when the food isnt that great. The soup and spring rolls were great as usual but it was sad to see them really drop the ball on their pork belly as its one of my favourite proteins to eat. I still plan to go here but not for their pork. I'll be sticking to their chicken dishes from now on.   Their regular dinner prices are steep once you add all the extras such as meat. Yes meat is an extra here so keep that in mind when checking out their prices."}
{"text":"I came here after reading a lot of good reviews but I have to say that I'm quite disappointed. The food was average at best. I had Pad Thai, and it was too sweet. I'm not sure what authentic Pad Thai tastes like since I've never been to Thailand, but the Pad Thai here tasted so different from what I had at Khao san road, Linda modern Thai and Pai Northen Thai (the Thai restaurants in Toronto that are generally considered to be authentic)   The service was ok."}
{"text":"This place is right by my place so I eat here often. My wife especially loves this place. Great Thai food that is not overly spiced or over done seems like everything is cooked just right and I know it's pretty popular in the neighbourhood as it's regularly busy. The actually restaurant is very small with seating for probably only 15 people but the service is good and if you get take away you'll still be just as satisfied. Servers are friendly and service is fairly quick as well. They do a great job here and I'd highly recommend it if you're in the Yonge and Shepard area, certainly the best Thai in the area."}
{"text":"Frankly, the best curry I have ever eaten. This was my first time ordering food from this place through UberEATS. I really enjoyed Ramen Tom Yum! It was slightly spicy and flavourful. The Curry Burger on Rice was amazing too - it had a beautiful combination of spices and was just so delicious. One thing to mention - the Chicken Satay dish is really really small but overall the food is worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"Overall, really decent thai food in this cool- market themed shop. Great service, tasty food!  Made the drive out from Markham here (since markham is lacking in good thai food). We had the mango salad and tom yum to start. The mango salad was amazing, with little crispy bits, perfect balance of sweet, salty. It was pretty good! For mains we had khao soi, a massaman curry and the pad Kee Mao.  You can customize your spice level- we had spicy and it was perfect.   Khao soi is Perfect for especially this cold winter weather. And while you're eating this over the bowl, it's hot and it's almost like you get this delicious thai spiced facial. Jokes aside- this is becoming one of my favourite dishes at thai restaurants over the pad Thai.   For dessert the mango sticky rice- which was the perfect way to end it off, the mango was perfectly sweet.  The thai iced tea was also great- and not overly sweet.   Portion sizes were generous, there was adequate seating.  The service was quick and attentive. Would definitely come here again, but I foresee parking becoming an issue on busier nights as there's only a few (4-5) spots up front."}
{"text":"As usual I had my bkk street food go to - beef pad kraprao, hot. Friendly service, outstanding food from a 5-day old resto. Good work BKK boys! I'll be back for more. And thanks for the complimentary shrimp chips for my check-in!"}
{"text":"This place is a little tucked away in the corner of a plaza.  Look for the EATBKK sign to help you find it.  Parking is tough to find so try the side streets.   I've tried the panang curry, pad see we and pad ped and also the mango sticky rice.  All were outstanding.  Portion sizes were pretty fair and very amazing flavours.  Maybe not the best thai place in town but 5 stars because of the value.   If you take out and pay cash you also get 10% off!  Been here 3 times and counting now."}
{"text":"We tried this new place two days ago. Thai restaurants don't seem to last in the Yonge and Sheppard area but I hope this one does. We had the chicken wings, prawn crackers (yelp checkin freebie) And hot and sour soup to start, followed by chicken panang curry and a beef glass noodle dish. Food was excellent and the portions generous.   Two down sides. The location is small. We were lucky enough to get a table several groups (2s & 3s) after us had to sit at the side table. Second issue is that they don't have AC. They had two large fans to keep the air moving but between the kitchen, the full dining room and the delicious food it get really really warm.   Therefore over all I would recommend this for place for parties of 4 and under.   There were multiple people who came to pick up food while we were there so there must be a take out option."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Been here twice the past week and I must say that I am greatly satisfied by the food they serve here.   I have had the Panaeng Curry, Pad Kee Mao, and the Khao Soi as my main entrees based on my last two visits.  The shrimp chips with its house made peanut sauce were addictive (and free with your Yelp check-in offer) and the chicken wings were a definitely hit with its bright flavours balanced with some spiciness to satisfy all your tastebuds.  All in all the flavours they bring are on point with fresh ingredients and great consistency each time I went. You can choose your level of spiciness and my preference would be the \"Spicy\" level.  One thing that they could possibly improve on is that they could make their chicken pieces that go with their entrees a bit more moist as I found it to be a bit dry and not as tender. Beef and shrimp options were good though."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out for a work lunch for about 10 people, most people got the lunch special. All the food was labelled and organized well. The hot & sour soup was really good and had a large variety of mushrooms. I got the shrimp because the chicken isn't halal but it only came with 5 shrimp which was disappointing. Everyone else seemed to like their meal, when I got my meal the noodles they were stuck together pretty tight cause of the steam I guess. They messed up something with the order and gave us a whole meal for free which was nice.   Overall from the reviews everyone has been saying their pad thai is really good, I thought it was just okay. The best pad thai I have had in TO is probably from Restoran Malaysia (Richmond Hill) or Sukho Thai (Downtown TO). May give it another chance one day..."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic Thai food, good price and generous portion. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Pad Thai and Kao Soi were serviceable - no better / no worse than dozens of pseudo-Thai restaurants across the city, but more expensive. We were planning to eat in, and waited 10 minutes for a parking spot, due to the atrocious parking situation, despite the place being only 1/2 full, HOWEVER it was hotter-than-Hades inside, easily 30c with no A/C, so we asked for our order to-go instead, and ate in the car. Honestly, at the over-inflated prices they are charging, they can afford to flick on the air-conditioning for the customers. But I would have forgiven all that if the food was as impressive as the hype and/or the prices, but sadly it was no better than any of the local delivery Thai joints. Food 2.5 stars, experience 0 stars. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! The atmosphere in the restaurant is casual and cozy. The service is also good too.   I really enjoy the Khao Soi and the Thai iced tea here and have had it a couple of times now. I was not a fan of the chicken wings though because the spice was too strong and the wings themselves were quite small. I give it 4 stars because it is enjoyable and worth going to, but nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Was craving thai food and decided to order take out from here. They have an online ordering system which is super convenient but when I went to pick it up, I saw they had a 10% off discount if you pay in cash (I think this may only apply for take out). We had the yellow curry and beef pad thai. Hit the spot and was filling for two hungry adults. Each dish cost $10.95 and then if you wanted me at you'd add $2+. I'd come back here and try dine-in."}
{"text":"New go to Thai place! Amazing, friendly staff and the food is just as incredible! We tried the Fried Morning Glory and it is the besf pile of deep fried vegetables you'll ever get! Also got the crispy pork pad Thai which was A++! I recommend getting spicy because the medium was not spicy at all."}
{"text":"I had been lamenting the lack of authentic Thai food in Toronto and a friend recommended this place to me. I rounded up a couple of fellow Yelpers to check it out with me so we could try a few things on the menu. The Thai iced tea is ok and not too sweet but to me was a little bland. After reading the previous reviews I'm now disappointed we didn't get a free appy for checking in! We ordered the shrimp chips with peanut sauce and the fish cakes to share. Both were delicious. The fish cakes were small and had 6 in a serving, so very easy to share. They are hands down my favourite Thai dish, and I have ordered them in literally every Thai place I've been to, so I can say without doubt that they were done very well here!! The shrimp chips were great, and peanut sauce was chunky and full of real peanuts. I love a Pad Thai, but was scared to order it since I've had so many butchered versions in Toronto, so I went with the Pad See Ew. Wow! It is the best Thai dish I've had outside of Thailand, including Khao San Road and Pi. It had the right amount of spice which gave it a bit of a kick. I was so full I got to box it up and take it home for my dinner. I was so consumed by my meal I can't remember what my friends ordered, needless to say they both loved theirs too. I only wish this restaurant was closer to my home, but it is worth the trek."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times now.  The food is a pretty decent Thai option for North York (still nowhere close to Sukothai on Parliament though) and the weekday lunch specials are good value.  BUT parking is always a real pain, service is often below average, and the latest stunt the restaurant pulled was too much.  If you're paying with a debit/credit card, you can no longer choose to enter in your own tip.  They made it mandatory to tip either 15%, 18% or 20% based on the AFTER tax amount.  I refuse to patronize a restauarant that feels entitled to such an underhanded money grab."}
{"text":"This is one of the above average Thai restaurant in the city and definitely one of the best in north York. Located in a strip mall that has limited parking but we were lucky to get a spot in front of a tenant next door that is closed. It took over a place that was previously a dessert place and kept most of the design. Nice little space with round mirrors that brings in light to this small unit and some wood planks. Pad Thai here is not the usual ketchup stained noodle but more soya sauce based and has a nutty taste. Curry was very flavourful. We ordered mild which is good for people like me who loves curry but have low tolerance in spiciness. Free shrimp crackers provided if you check in on Yelp. The AC was out of order thou so i was sweating heavily under the 30 degree temperature which truly suits the name of this restaurant. Overall food was lovely and I will definitely come here again but might get take out instead j"}
{"text":"This review is only for the lunch menu. They have a great lunch menu, but it gets really pack during lunch time, and sitting can be an issue. Their food is really good, and authentic; and if you order from the lunch menu, you will get your food in no time.  The size of the dishes is larger than expected (I could not finish it), and I loved that they include a spring roll with your plate. The green curry is excellent, and remember to ask for more spice if you want! if not, the dish will be mild.  Just like seating, parking can be an issue, but you can always park on one of the adjacent streets. Walking is really more convenient."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch place. It has $9.99 lunch combo, which is a steal! I love their curry rice as well as chicken skews. However even the mild curry rice is quite spicy for me. Pad thai is a bit disappointed. Beef in the pad thai is quite dry. Shrimp chips and thai ice tea are my favorite"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. why does this place have such great reviews?! The pad thai was INCREDIBLY salty and the noodles would break so easily because it was overcooked.  The chicken satay starter was horrible defrosted boiled chicken with no real flavour if you don't put the sauce on it.  The Massaman Curry's beef was tough and dry. The Basil Crispy Belly Pork had zero moisture left in it and was hard enough that I could barely pick it up with my fork.    I understand that people might think this place is great because it's cheap, but really that's all it is. CHEAP fast food.  Not like I expected fresh meat that isn't frozen.  But nothing is good about this place.  Not sure what the hype is, I think people are just excited for a thai place in this area."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with some big taste! The noodles and rice dishes here don't disappoint. You can choose how spicy you'd like your food, but becareful, because spicy is really spicy! The mango sticky rice was quite exotic, however, it wasn't as good as it looked. Overall, a good addition to the city's growing Thai food scene!"}
{"text":"This is a must eat within the food dense corridor of North York.  Service is friendly and food fast to come out despite the brisk take away business that they always do.  The morning glory flower appetizer isn't always available, but when it is, you've got to try it - it's crispy and delicious and goes great with the salad that they serve with it!  If you're vegetarian or vegan, just make sure to confirm what goes into your meal (e.g. egg, seafood sauces etc.), they were very accomodating!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious here. One of best Thai food I've had and this had become my go to when I'm craving Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! Definitely come again. This is a small restaurant so if you plan to come with a few friends, better call ahead to reserve a table. It was full when we came at 6pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Authentic and delish! Pad thai tastes of tamarind, not a weird red ketchup like sauce that other restaurants do. Lunch specials are a great deal.. comes with spring rolls and soup. I recommend getting the curry dishes from the regular menu, much bigger portion of that yummy curry sauce!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night ordered,  paneng chicken, kao soi, curry spaghetti and fried rice beef. Everything was very fresh and flavourful.  This is a welcome addition to the area! I'll definitely go back to try more dishes"}
{"text":"Quick lunch service and good food.  Had the chicken satay and mango salad lunch deal - price was excellent. Would go back to try one of the curry dishes. I've been told they are terrific!"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant tucked in this plaza in north york. Downside is the parking - almost impossible to find a parking in that location (you would have to park further & walk). Food is pretty good. Their pad thai is not my favorite however what stands out is their pineapple fried rice! I do believe this place runs heavily on takeout/deliveries as it doesnt seat many people. Overall a great thai restaurant to test out!"}
{"text":"This place is very thoughtfully designed, from their diverse menu, restaurant app (and perks!), and great consistent quality of food.   Protip: sign in the mobile device app for the first time to get a free thai iced tea! It's best thai iced tea in the city. (not sure how long this offer lasts)  One of the most interesting things I've eaten all year and LOVE is the Morning Glory! I get it every time I am here.   There are so many interesting things on the menu that beg to be tried and demand multiple visits.   In order to keep this review brief I won't go into detail into every dish I've tried. It's one of the few new restaurants of 2016 that actually entertains with it's unique recipes. I consider this place mandatory homework for those Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times and the sign caught my eye at least 9/10 times so I did a little yelp search and here I am writing my own review about it!   After circling the incredibly small parking lot about 6 and a half times I finally walk in and proceed to the cash as I am ordering take-out. The restaurant is small, so if you don't like closed environments I suggest you get take-out cause the food is awesome. Anyways I got 2x Thai Iced Tea, chicken pad thai, chicken satay and the tacos.   The service was very friendly and accommodating as I was trying to get everything to my car, the server jumped and helped me. After complimenting my car and having a little chit-chat I drove off.  The food was good. I didn't expect much as Thai food in Toronto is either authentic and good or Thai Express. The chicken pad thai was standard fare from most authentic thai joints, the chicken satay was veeeeery good and the peanut sauce provided with it was equally as good! The tacos were just the chicken satay and the peanut sauce in a pita shell, if I read the menu properly and noticed that I would've gotten the poutine. Still good but tasted like the chicken satay to be honest. The Thai Iced Tea was on the sweeter side but was not lacking flavour what so ever   I would come back to try the other items if I'm ever in the area"}
{"text":"I like Thai food flavors, which tastes fresh especially in summer. Compared with other Thai express chains, its nearly the same price but here can reward nice service and original tastes. Whether eat with friends or alone , it's a good choice for me to keep hungry away."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for somewhere that was accessible for 4 friends (3 of whom live in North York) and who have various dietary restrictions (veg, gluten & dairy free). This place is very unassuming from the outside, tucked in a little strip mall by a gas station. But inside it's adorable, the decor is reminiscent of an SE Asia market. It's a small place, but we were able to get a 6 person table after only a 15 min wait.  The food was very good, definitely try the Fried Morning Glory app, it's a gorgeous & delicious mound of fried vegetables which was a generous app for 4 people. We also shared Pad Thai, Basil Beef and Panang Curry all of which were tasty, although not the best I've ever had.  The service was good, despite a packed house. Would definitely come back if I needed a restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"I literally live across the street and have the fortune of trying their lunch specials twice. I had the lunch special pad thai and their masamam beef. Both were excellent. The flavors are rich and doesn't taste like what I call \"Chinese Thai Food\". I haven't been to Thailand but the flavors here are more distinct from your run of the mill places.   Prices are more or less on point. It's more expensive then your pseudo thai restaurants, but not as expensive as those fancy/hyped ones. Lunch special is great value adding a soup and spring roll to your order.   Pretty small and inside a very forgettable plaza.This location had several businesses closed down but with the latest condo development and the LCBO mall, I hope they stick around because I'll probably go here weekly/biweekly for their lunch special."}
{"text":"Visited Sat May 13 for dinner.  Didn't make resos in advance, this place was packed! Seats about 30. We were seated along the counter on the left, which was a bit cramped. The counter height was a bit high compared to the seat height and my seat was wobbly.  Pros The decor makes this place authentic, seeing the Bankok subway map, common thai ingredients and even the Thai alphabet.  Morning glory - Deep fried spinach, MUST GET ITEM! This item didn't have a thumbs-up symbol beside it. It was very unique, crunchy and tasty. Pad Thai - Didn't have as much sauce as I would have like. Good flavour, I wish I had made it spicier.  Thai iced tea - Came very quickly, sweet and creamy!  Cons  Basil crispy pork kai dao - The pork was really tough and chewy.  Parking is very tough to get to only 3 parking spots in front. Yonge St is always busy.   Protip - Free park on the side streets, it takes a bit of time to find and walk to the resto. Thailand is well known for their lady-boys, one of their staff would fit this description.   Damage - $43 after tax, before tip"}
{"text":"Soup is salty, Pad Thai is not what I have expected. I had real traditional Pad Thai in Thailand, I thought this place would provide real Thai food. Unfortunately, they didn't meet my taste."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see so many good Thai joints popping up all over the city! Eat BKK/ Eat in Bangkok is tucked away next to the Hero Burger, but it's bright and spacious inside. Their use of technology in ordering for pickup/delivery is pretty neat. The app is easy to use and if you don't care for it, just call in!  The staff were very nice, and quick with the order. I got the green Thai curry chicken, and let me tell you... they don't mess around with the spice levels. I got level 4 of 5, and that got me a little watery.   The prices are comparable to other Thai restaurants, and the Menu looks quite interesting (Khao Soi Poutine?!?!). I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"My lazy night, so I ordered delivery from here. I must say this restaurant is comparable to the ones in downtown. I've ordered the Fish cake from the BKK starter. It has a nice spice to it. I like the Pad Kee Mao but it's an additional $4 for the shrimp. Noodles and flavour everything is good. If you are okay with other types of protein, don't bother with the shrimp as I don't think it's crunchy enough, the texture of the shrimp isn't too good. Too soft.   Last but not least, the Pad Kaprao Kai Dao. This is rice with mince meat on the side and a sunny side up! Again you can choose minced pork, chicken or beef. The marinade and flavour is very good. But tonight, I find the mince meat a little over cooked.   I will be back again as the dishes have good layer of flavours and authentic!"}
{"text":"Ordered a take out from this place. Loved their mango salad and veg green curry. Delicious food. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The limited parking spots and tight space inside the restaurant were less than ideal but the spectacular food and quick service made up for it. The wings were so unique and flavourful...highly recommend it. The pad see ew and khao soi noodle dishes tasted fresh and flavourful. The larb salad was good, but not as stellar in comparison to the other dishes. Totally would come back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from EatBkk since they first opened and was always a fan of the food and the fact that there was a fairly legit Thai restaurant in the hood. As of late the quality of food has dropped substantially. One of my favourite dishes on the menu is Beef Massaman which used to be served with tender slow cooked chunks of beef which would fall apart almost like brisket. In my last order about a month ago I ordered the same dish and almost 90% of the meat was fat. I had to throw away the meal as it was disgusting. I figured it must have been an off day for them. Just today I decided to give it another shot and every single piece was a huge blob of jelly like fat - absolutely appalling and disgusting. I even have pictures to prove this but have chosen not to post it as it's a horrible sight.  To the owners - if this is your way of managing higher costs, i.e. skimping out on real meat and serving almost inedible food, you guys need to go back and think about what made you successful in the first place. At this rate, be prepared to lose more customers."}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting this place after checking out the ratings on Yelp.  We ordered for takeout and ordered the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special and the Mango Rice dessert.  Portion wise, the Pad Thai was average for lunch (see picture) but I wouldn't pay full price for the same portion.  However, ingredients-to-noodle ratio is pretty good.  The Mango Rice is actually really good!  The Mango isn't overly sour and goes really well with the coconut sauce (unlike others I've tried).  The spring roll is good too because it's not too soggy but crunchy.  The gentleman who took our order was very friendly.  We got our meals within 20 minutes.  3.5 stars out of 5... May update or review next time we visit"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different and decided to order Pad Kraprao Kai Dao - so glad we did! This dish is delicious :) very flavourful with good kick of spicy. Will be back."}
{"text":"Went here the other for lunch with a couple of girlfriends and it was DeLish!   We made a reservation for 12:30 which was great considering the size of the restaurant didn't think that they reservations, but they do it.   Our server was wonderful.. I'm sorry that I didn't catch his name...he had only been in Canada one month and he was from Bangkok.   We all have the Thai iced tea which I really liked the flavour it was very refreshing and very good.   We had 2 appetizer of fish cakes ....they were OK they were very dense and kind of weird very squishy like tofu, we had the shrimp chips and peanut sauce they were OK too, not much flavour on the chip, and the peanut sauce was yummy.   All 3 entrées that we had were very good and likely I would return here to try out some other items."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 11:30 on a Thursday. I was surprised that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, but by 12pm, it was completely packed. I'd definitely recommend coming before the lunch rush, otherwise you'd be waiting for a table for quite a while, considering there is limited seating in there! There are also only a couple of parking spots outside of the restaurant. As for the interior, the wall is cute, with little mirrors and drawn pictures of a transit map and food.  We ordered 2 lunch specials (Pad Thai Chicken and Green Curry Grilled Chicken). They came with soup of the day and 2 spring rolls per dish.   We got Hot and Sour soup that day. I'm glad that the two flavours balanced each other out perfectly, so it wasn't overly hot nor sour. In terms of the spring rolls, they were really crispy but there wasn't much inside it- too little vegetable and too much potato.   Tha Pad Thai Chicken was delicious. The rice noodles were chewy, and we got a good amount of tender meat in the dish. I found that the tamarind sauce was a bit on the sweeter side, compared to the sister restaurants Kub Khao and Jatujak.   The green curry tasted nice and refreshing. It came with a LOT of rice. I wish we got more chicken; seemed like we were mostly eating bamboo shoots.   Remember to check in on Yelp to receive free shrimp chips! They were crispy, and tasted delicious when dipped in the peanut sauce it came with!  Service was good. The food came out pretty fast, and the servers are nice and attentive. I would definitely come back again for some good Thai food!"}
{"text":"Finally a good thai food restaurant in North York. First time visited fluids place and the food was very good. Staff was friendly and have my lots of information about their food. I ordered the panang curry and the thai coconut soup and thy were both delicious. I feel this place is a bit over priced though but the food was good."}
{"text":"Again, can't exaggerate the Thai Iced Tea - it's a must.   Morning Glory is definitely bigger at this location (I wrote a review for the Kitchen + Bar location about this).   Som Tum (papaya salad) with Salted Crab is pretty good as well. But I suggest you either get the morning glory or this, and not both!   Pineapple Fried Rice is still tasty as hell - lots of wok power.   Tom Yum soup was still mediocre to me.   The yellow curry and the Khao Soi are the VERY alike. I recommend the Khao Soi over the curry - especially if you like beef. It's a better quality beef - more like brisket.   Curry comes with rice! We also ordered roti with it - again nothing special but we were craving for it.   The Sticky Mango Rice is lathered with coconut milk. Not quite as amazing as those in Thailand, probably due to the quality of mango. It is still better than most places in the GTA where I've had it. The rice is reaaaaaallly sticky."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered three things to share, the \"Veggie Fresh Rolls\" as a starter, and the \"Basil Braise Beef Kai Dao\" and the \"Pad Thai\" as our mains. The Veggie Fresh Rolls stayed true to its name, it was fresh and served cold with two dips. The peanut sauce dip and the Thai sweet/vinegar dip were both excellent compliments to the rolls. The Pad Thai was very flavourful, but while it was very tasty, it didn't really set itself apart from any other Pad Thai dishes we've had in the past. The Braised Beef Kai Dao for those unfamiliar is a Braised Beef stir-fry with rice on the side and a Thai-style fried egg (Kai Dao) on top. The egg was a sunny side up egg with crispy edges. This was a new dish we've never had before, and we loved it. The combination worked very well with the sauce which had a bit of a spicy kick - made it all the tastier!!   Service: We came here for date night and had a reservation suspecting that it might be busy on a Saturday evening. We were pleased to see that there were very few people dining at 6PM which meant we were greeted and shown right away to our seats. Throughout the evening our water was refilled without asking. Our starter, the \"Veggie Fresh Rolls\"came very quickly. If it didn't taste so fresh, I would have suspected that they were pre-made and they would slice'em up when somebody orders them. The main food however did take quite a while to come. Granted it was braised beef, I'll give them a pass on that. It should be noted that because they do a lot of take-out orders, it contributed to their slow service time on our main dishes.   Atmosphere: The exterior of the restaurant doesn't exactly scream \"eat here for a romantic evening\". We weren't expecting much considering the restaurant is at Yonge and Sheppard - well known for its chaotic traffic. However, once inside, we found that it was a nice cozy restaurant with fairly modern but authentic Thai décor with roughly 10-15 tables. If you are driving, expect to look for street parking since the parking outside the restaurant is very limited (2 or 3 spots). I do want to say that one thing which irked me was people were constantly standing right behind me while waiting for their take out orders. Because they do so many take-out orders and there is no separation between the cashier and dining area, it was definitely intrusive to our privacy and took points away from my overall dining experience.   Verdict: Highly recommend this restaurant for take-out or casual dining with some family and friends. Date nights can be here but atmosphere is definitely not the most inviting for romantic evenings. At the end of the day it's about the food and they definitely hit a home-run on that front."}
{"text":"The place has a niche look. With writings and artwork etc on the wall. Clean for sure. The staff accommodated our egg allergy request, since normally Thai cuisine has eggs in them.  We ordered two dishes: Pad kee Mao and Pad kha na. The portions were just right where you're not over stuffed but full. The crispy pork in the pad kha na was amazing. I liked the dishes on the menu, quite diff from most other restaurants. And the food was delicious. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I go here whenever I'm in the Yonge/Sheppard area because the food is THAT good. And the price is good for the portions you get. The khao soi and pad thai are amazing. Ask for chili oil on the side if you can handle the heat. And the mango sticky rice is to DIE FOR. You must get it!!"}
{"text":"Taste is good! Too bad they don't carry Thai Beer, may be they haven't got liquor license."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch.  It's a small restaurant with only a few tables.  We waited over half an hour for our food and the food was just so so.  It definitely doesn't worth the wait.  The thai iced tea tasted like sugar water.  Service was bad.  Will not come back again.    If you really wanna try this restaurant, check in on yelp and get an order of shrimp chips for free.  That's the only dish I like there."}
{"text":"Dinner for 2 people.  Omitted some of our orders.  Gave us the wrong bill.  Employees need to pay attention.  Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Tried their takeout and the dishes were pretty tasty. The Mango Salad was very good and slightly spicy and the Panaeng Curry beef was flavourful with a coconut and peanut flavoured thick curry sauce. I liked that the dishes had a touch of spice but not too much. I think you can tell them how spicy you want it as well. I would definitely order some other dishes on their menu another time."}
{"text":"There was a little bit of a wait but it was worth it. Food was very tasty and service was good and friendly. It's a new restaurant and tons of people were getting take out so it was really busy. The food came out a little slow but I think they are working out the efficiencies of the kitchen. I'm confident it will be better the next time we go."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back again! Tom Yum Soup and Red Curry were definitely on point and so flavourful! Not too spicy, just a little kick :P Parking was not too easy to find tho since it's in a small plaza with limited parking :/ They also offer ubereats!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food in the North York area, i no longer have to trek downtown to get a decent plate of pad thai! I tried the Kao Soi and thought it was a touch too salty but the flavours were great. The banana nann dessert was legit, tasted exactly like the ones i got in Thailand.  My only complaint is that the portions are on the tiny side but i'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've had food from this restaurant on 3 occasions: eat-in, Uber Eats, and regular takeout. I have been impressed on all 3 occasions.  It's not the most inexpensive Thai option, but I feel you get good value for what you pay for in terms of food quality and quantity. The dishes I've had here were just as good as the much raved-about Pai, but in my experience the portions are larger here. Tastewise, the mango coconut sticky rice is a must try -- loads better than the version offered at Pai. I'm also a big fan of the green curry.  For my most recent takeout order, I was told my food would be ready in 15-20 minutes, but I ended up only having to wait a little over 5 minutes! What's more, the dishes came out piping hot and they were still very warm when I arrived home nearly 45 minutes later! I'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Given the 4 star Yelp rating out of 148 or so reviews, I had high expectations. In hindsight, I should have done more research. We came for lunch the other day and ordered the masaman beef curry lunch special, the khao soi poutine, and the satay tacos. For the price, everything was rather lacking.  Service was rather lackluster and surprisingly slow. I'm accustomed the kind of brisk, efficient service at Chinese restaurants even if it comes with more curtness than some prefer in service. However, I don't expect curtness and lack of service. Even in Chinese restaurants, servers roam the restaurant seeing who needs help. here, I felt like I was always raising my hand and trying to get the attention of whoever was behind the counter at that time. On the upside, I suppose that going up to the counter and paying, then placing a tip in the tip jar means tips are optional. Or well, is that what that jar means? Is that why the service is sub-par?  The masaman beef curry came in a large, round bowl with curry on one side, and rice on the other. On top of the rice were two veggie spring rolls. While having the spring rolls was a plus in my books, it's rather odd that they were on top of the rice. When we picked them up, rice stuck to the rolls. There really wasn't much beef in the curry, especially at that price point. Flavor-wise, it wasn't particularly profound. It was mostly just sweet.   The satay tacos look more like flour tortilla boats than tacos. They're mostly filled with lettuce and other veggies, and the satay part was more peanut sauce than actual protein. The peanut sauce was sweet, but I feel like some mom at home could have made the exact same thing except she would have given me more chicken.  The khao soi poutine was the best of the three. The concept behind it is great. The execution left something to be desired. Presentation-wise, it looked a tad clunky. The pieces of beef were chunkier than I'd like for a topping on top of my fries. There was cheese, but it disappeared into the curry sauce. The curry sauce was very wet. Khao soi is a soup noodle dish. Poutine usually has thick gravy. The curry sauce here should probably have been a thicker curry sauce, closer to gravy consistency, to keep the fries crisp. However, here, it was broth consistency. My fries were literally swimming in soup. I'll never know if those fries had been crispy or not. They were very, very wet.  All in all, nothing here makes me want to come back. I've had much better Thai food for cheaper, and with better service. I think I'm going to try to make that poutine at home though."}
{"text":"After a friend mentioned that Eat BKK is open and they had dined here, I decided to stop by for takeout. The restaurant is in a little plaza on the west side of Yonge, beside Hero Certified Burger. There is limited parking in front of the restaurant itself, so you may need to consider street parking on nearby side streets.  The restaurant itself is not very big (think 25-28 seats), and has a less polished look than sister restaurants Jatujak and Kub Khao. I called in my order and food was waiting for me when I arrived 20 minutes later. I ordered chicken pad Thai, red curry beef, and Penang chicken curry. These came with a large takeout container of white rice.   Serving sizes of the dishes were decent for the $10.95 paid for each of the curries and pad Thai. Both curries were very flavourful and proteins were plentiful. The pad Thai was thankfully less sugary sweet than at Kub Khao (but possibly a bit drier, perhaps due to sitting in the takeout container for the drive home).   I plan to return with hubby another time to try some of the Bangkok fusion food items featured on the menu. 3.5 stars based on takeout experience."}
{"text":"This place is so over priced. I took a picture of the soup we got and it was only half of the container and it looked like someone drank half and they gave me the other half."}
{"text":"Giving this place a five star because the food and service are both amazing!   I ordered a yellow curry with tofu- the curry tastes really good. Not too creamy or spicy. They fried the tofu as well so the texture is great.   The restaurant is really small though so I would suggest doing take out if there is a long wait. I would definitely revisit again."}
{"text":"I've been back here and have ordered delivery and I now have a go-to dish: the deep fried soft shell crab in curry sauce is my jam. Served with rice. So so delicious!"}
{"text":"The best green curry chicken I've ever had. Period.  Hot, spicy, creamy deliciousness.  I loved it so much that I asked the waiter if he could tell me what brand of ingredients they use. I've been trying to make a good green curry chicken at home and I haven't been able to get it right. I'm thinking it may be the brand of green curry paste I've been using. So I was hoping that the culinary gods at BKK could fill me in on their secret. No such luck, the waiter said. \"The chef says come back here and you can eat it here!\" I decried that I don't live in the country, so my chances of getting this curry again again are extremely slim. Sadly, my plea of foreignness didn't get me very far.  My stepson had the pad Thai chicken and husband had the drunken noodle. They were both hot, fresh and predictable. It's truly the green curry that stands out here.  Service was friendly and swift. An adequate amount of tables in the trendy, size-challenged shop. Tucked away in a shopping strip, it's not a large restaurant and parking can be the biggest challenge. But if you can order pick-up or somehow snag yourself a parking spot and a seat inside, definitely come for the green curry. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and courteous. Always attentive and were quick to clear finished plates.  The food items we ordered: Shrimp Chips (complimentary with check-in): amazing, combined with the peanut sauce, couldn't get enough. The spices on these chips give it a subtle kick that add to the flavour. Even without the peanut sauce they taste great. 9.5/10 Curry Puffs: These were great, perfect crust on these pastries, they broke apart as you ate them but did not crumble all over the place. The curry flavour was a bit mild but overall, very satisfying. 8/10 Satay: The Satay was prepared well, flavours were a bit lacking if eaten by themselves, but once lathered with peanut sauce, they were amazing 9/10 Tom Yum soup (Shrimp): The typical flavours you'd come to expect from Tom Yum, but with a bit of creaminess. Still undecided about how I feel about this soup, but the flavours were spot on. 7/10 Pad Thai (Chicken): The pad thai was good, the amount of tamarind flavour was spot on. 8.5/10 Green Curry (Beef): I found the consistency of the green curry was just right for mixing with the rice, not too runny and not too thick. The flavours were bold but not overpowering on the palate. The coconut milk in  this adds the right amount of sweetness to this. 9.5/10 Mango Sticky Rice: The rice was prepared well, not overcooked with a good amount of chewiness, the mangos were sweet with a good amount of tartness to them. It could have used a little more sauce, but otherwise it was great. 8.5/10  The Thai iced tea was great, the flavor was bold, but not overpowering when paired with the food  The facilities were clean and well-kept, not a thing to complain about.  The dining room is small due to the shop size, but it is organized in such a way you won't be bumping chairs. The decor is simple and chic. The hand drawn art on the mirrors around the store adds a nice personal touch showing off the style of the owners.  Food: 9/10 Drink: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 8/10  This place was great and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I got the masaman curry with beef. It's delicious but it's not the masaman that I am used to. It's not as rich as the other places but good either way. The beef is braised beef. Super soft! They also served Thai ice tea. It's really good too!!"}
{"text":"2/5  I used to go here when they just opened. I found their food was a ok, but it's more authentic than commercial Thai restaurants and since there aren't any good Thai restaurants around this neighborhood, I didn't mind paying little extra for better food.  However, I recently went there and was shock with their changes. Place was still the same old disorganized small fast pace take out family restaurant with bored and occassionally sassy servers. But they made changes with the menu and now they are charging mediocre beef curry for almost $20. I mean.. do they think they are Pai restaurant? Sure, economy is tough and all but their recent changes just doesn't make any sense to me. There are no change of recipes, no ingredient upgrade, no changes of ambience, no upgraded customer services or change of house system for better service. So I'm not sure what made them think they are $20 price range restaurant but I can confidently say it is not.   I'm giving extra star for being little more authentic than other Thai restaurants around the neighborhood but they seriously need to have reality check with themselves.   Definitely not going to return."}
{"text":"A very small place with only few tables. Nothing fancy! But the food is simply awesome. We tried Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken, and Pad Kraprao Kai Dao with Chicken (basically rice with special preparation of chicken). Wow! Both dishes were amazingly delicious with lots of flavors. You can also choose level of spiciness if you like spicy food. The servers were very friendly. Price was great."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for thai food in north york ever since they opened. However i noticed their service has been declining ever since. Came to have an early dinner today - there were another 3 couples sitting next to us. The server brought the food wrong TWICE - no apology for the first one. the second time she brought it to the table next to us, not noticing until we called it out. After that she just stayed away from our table without checking in and refilling our water. Their food is great though! I guess i will start doing uber eats more often!"}
{"text":"Just awesome! Fantabulous! Had the crispy basil pork dish. Quick service, great flavour and across from my condo lol"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! I came in when Toronto had their first snow storm and it took almost 2 hours to get here. I can definitely say it was well worth it.   The pad Thai was delicious !! So well worth the $9.95.  A hint: don't forget to download the app to get a free Thai iced tea! So good! And you seriously don't want to miss out on it.  Also got the mussamun curry with veggies - very different and it wasn't like the one I had at Thai basil or Thai one on. That poutine with curry tho was something I will go back and have again and again. It was special and delicious and just in love with it.  Can't wait to go again but not on a snowy day this time. :)"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food in North York. Unfortunately took one star off because its really hard to be in and out in 1 hour at this restaurant.... If only service was a little quicker I would go much more often."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend. Ordered Pad Kraprao Kai Dao. The best I've ever had. Probably go back again and try another dishes."}
{"text":"Days like this are when I wish I could leave a sixth star!  My girlfriend (vegan) and I were looking for a reasonable meal choice near her house a couple hours before I was set to leave Toronto. We had settled on getting something quick for obvious reasons and found BKK on The Yelps.  Small \"bar-sized\" space for the restaurant. It's in a totally unassuming strip mall next to an overwhelmingly distracting burger place. Took us a second to spot it - it's behind the ridiculous bull statue. No wait when we got inside and we basically got a server with menus and waters immediately.   The food - this is what it was all about. I ordered the red curry with chicken and a coconut / lemongrass soup. My girlfriend got pineapple fried rice with tofu. The only way to describe all three is exceptional. The pineapple fried rice was really the star of the show, though, this is probably one of the 10 most delicious things I've had in my life and it was so damn simple. I guess that's part of why I loved it. The curry was rich and flavorful. The soup was something else - I had never had anything like it and the combination of tart lemon flavor with the creaminess of a coconut base was sensational. I highly recommend it.   Overall - eat here. Try the pineapple fried rice. Do it."}
{"text":"The last time that I ate from a Thai restaurant was sometime last year and I had this sudden craving for Thai food, something different from what I usually eat when I'm out and a about. So after searching for any Thai places in my area, Eat BKK conveniently came up and I decided to give their dishes a try.  The three items I ordered on-line were the Veggie Fresh Springrolls, Massamam Beef Curry lunch special, and the coconut milk soup Khoa Soi. And I'll just say this all three items are definitely best eaten right there at a table inside the restaurant.  I could see a whole fresh min leaf inside one of the springrolls which made it look so appetizing and the flavor was actually could after heating it slightly. The peanut sauce also paired up well with each bite of the spring roll.  The Khoa Soi looks similar to a coconut chicken soup in my home country and the major difference with the Thai Khoa Soi was in the flavor, the type of noodles used and also the garnishes. The flavor of the soup tasted distinctly different with a strong flavor of basil and also it was slightly sweet, and of course the flavor was all concentrated in the soup itself.  The Massamam curry is something new to me but it also was very flavorful and I always like most of my curries to have potatoes in it.  All three items hit the spot and satisfied my craving for Thai food, and I will be getting more dishes from Eat BKK."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Eat BKK for our double date dinner and we all loved it! Eat BKK is a small boutique restaurant so I'd recommend that you book a table ahead of time. My friend booked us a table during prime time so we got a seat right away when we arrived. Service was great.  Appetizers: * SHRIMP CHIPS (4/5) I love shrimp chips!! I wonder if they make these in-house because the shrimp chips I usually eat at Thai restaurants are much thicker than these. The shrimp chips here are thin and flavourful. It comes with peanut sauce for dipping.  * MANGO SALAD (4/5) Something healthy needed to be added to our list of items for the night! Mango salad was marinated very well - the mango were sweet and crunchy cashews were paired with it.   Mains: * GREEN CURRY + chicken (5/5) I looooveeeddd my choice!! We were basically choosing the items that had a *thumbs up* on the menu, which was one of the popular / recommended items by Eat BKK. The green curry had a strong coconut flavour to it, for those who don't like coconut-flavours.. be warned! I love coconut flavoured thai dishes so this was perfect for me. This comes with a bowl of rice.  * PAD KRAPRAO KAI DAO (4/5) (beef, fried eggs, basil, onions, pepper) The listed items sounded very flat and plain from the menu, but my boyfriend trusted the *thumbs up* icon and decided to order this. Wise choice *slow claps* haha. This was delish!! The beef was diced in tiny pieces and had soo much flavour to it. He mentioned he would order this again the next time we visit!  * KHAO SOI  (egg noodle, bean sprouts, pickled cabbage) My friend ordered the khao soi and I only had room to try a bit of the noodle soup - It was sooo goodd. I don't want to put a rating with this dish as I've only tried a tiny bit of her meal (too stuffed!) but my friend did mention this is her go-to dish whenever she visits (and she comes here very often).  Dessert: * MANGO STICKY RICE (4/5) I've always loved Thai mango sticky rice so I did make room for this dessert. We shared this dessert amongst 4 people, which I think is a good portion after a full meal. The rice portion was a lot (It was equivalent to the bowl of rice I got from the green curry)!! Loved the sauce that marinated the rice - I believe it is coconut milk (?) I highly recommend this dessert!!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot! I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food I received for the lunch special. I chose the green curry special with rice, spring rolls and hot & sour soup. Really good flavours and great portion, too. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Great food, affordable price, students and local professionals crowds. Big portions.  Would be nice if the servant would smile a bit.  It is so busy, and they are so serious, you get the impression you need to leave asap you finish your food."}
{"text":"Just got my order through order eats, i will keep it simple... This is by far THE BEST and i mean THE BEST Thai food i have had in Toronto.  If you knew the type of critic i was you would understand me saying that is hard to believe but i am not even trying to be bias because the restaurant is so close to me. If you don't believe me try it for yourself.   This place makes Linda's Modern Thai seem like the McDonalds of Thai food  I ordered: Pineapple friend rice with chicken Pad sew with chicken Red curry chicken Curry puffs - sooooo good"}
{"text":"I saw this online and realized it was right beside my place in North York, I had to try it! My fiancé and I came twice, once for dinner, once for lunch. Their pad Thai is very delicious and authentic! You can tell by first the color that they do not use a commercial pad Thai sauce. And then you take a bite... you KNOW it's good pad Thai. My fiancé got their stir fry dish with chicken and devoured it! The place is small but very clean! There is limited parking and the parking is shared with other vendors on the lot but we didn't have trouble parking either time of our visits.  The service is also great, they're courteous and patient, and just very sweet :) I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yo. Food is lit, fam. Ate green curry. Bomb AF. Big ass shrimp. Come thru with the homies."}
{"text":"Ok - the food here is stellar. I mean bat shit, delicious, crazy yummmmmmm. But let's talk about the parking for a second.   If you work or live in the Yonge and shepp area then you will understand the horrifying amount of traffic in the area. I'm a 905'er so I rarely come here and when I do, the least I expect is pay parking - which I am ok with.   Not this place. Picture Thailand. Tight, impossible spots to fit it governed by threatening signs that will have you towed if you park in them.   Who cares I thought. Parked, ordered, stuffed face.   Walked out after 15 mins only to realize that my car was in tact, no ticket, no fine, all good times.   Eat here for sure. But park at your own risk.   I laid it on the line so can't comment on secret, free parking sports in the area.   If you get booked - just play dumb. Or you can eat fast and dash out of there before parking patrol even has a chance."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's authentic Thai by far in the Yonge and Sheppard area. Ordering take out online is so easy and quick. I usually do take out and always satisfied with all dishes. 2 Thumbs!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch 3 times. Had the poutine which was delicious but def on the salty side, pad thai was ok had a ketchupy taste, green curry was good but a little too sweet, and the mango rice desert thing which was gooooood.  It's a good alternative to the thai places downtown, just not as good imo.  Parking there is a nightmare, place was packed 2/3 times I went for lunch"}
{"text":"Get the BKK app and get a free thai ice tea! It was so tasty! YUM! The food here is decent. Pad thai is very tasty with the awesome tamarind sauce. The papaya salad with crab was enjoyed by my date. This place use to be a dessert place. I kind of miss it now. LOL. Parking is a major PITA here. Its close to the subway and WholeFoods. I would only come again if I had no other choice and was in the area. Cheers! 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Firstly, parking is very very sparse, but the residential area directly on the left side will allow you to part it's just going to be a short walk.   We started with the chicken satay tacos. They were really good the filling was great. I think the reason I wasn't 100 percent impressed with them was because they used the oldelpaso taco bowls. I don't know something about just knowing they buy those just didn't feel right to me. I didn't knock off any stars because I really did enjoy them.   Second, we got crispy pork pad Thai and yellow curry with coconut rice. Pad Thai was amazing, pork cooked amazingly! Yellow curry was warm, filling with a little bit of spice which I enjoyed. Overall, if you're looking for authentic amazing Thai food I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great clean, healthy fantastic food!  Five stars all the way.  I'm SO going back.  Great clean venue with a modern feel inside.  Well priced."}
{"text":"[2nd time take-out]  Have spaghetti curry chicken, same burger curry, satay chicken skewers, and roti.  The spaghetti was a bit.. gooey / burned.. the curry sauce was too liquid that bottom of the dish looks almost like soup-base. Given it's \"fusion\" thai-version spaghetti, fine.. But the herbs/leave/whatever-dark-green-black-looking thing mixed in the spaghetti, not only it tasted awful (i think it's rotten, they just didn't pick it out), the flavor was overwhelming.. Overall, the dish tasted neither spaghetti nor curry :((  The burger curry.. sigh.. the patty just tested weird.. perhaps expired. I don't know what meat or source it is from. But.. it taste like a frozen patty that has been sitting in my freezer for 3 years, now I finally remember to cook it.  On the upside, roti was good as expected :)  Satay chicken tasted the same as last time, I really like their peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Pad thai...was disappointing. Noodles were very soft..almost mushy..  Salted crab Sum Tom was flavourful. The salted crab was raw..which was interesting. But tasty. If I had known it was raw, I wouldn't have ordered that.   and Tom yum was decent!   Service was good!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:00pm. Restuarant was pretty packed but luckily we got the last seats (so no wait time yay!) Small restaurant, can fit around 25people. Saw some people ordered takeout to go during our time eating. Here's what we had:   Pad thai with chicken ($14.95) - I like it, good flavour Massaman curry with beef ($14.95) - not your traditional curry, it is on the sweet side and not spicy  Chicken satay ($8.95) - 5 skewers covered with peanut sauce   Overall food are good but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"First off this place is a bit more expensive comparing to Kub Khao giving the location is right on Yonge I believe the price is fair but the portion don't really justify the cost.  I ordered chicken satay, fish cake and green curry.  Taste wise Kub Khao was a lot better.  I also prefer Kub Khao menu selection better.  Maybe they can have some signature dishes from Kub Khao to Eat BKK.  Also if you are going to dine in, there's no A/C and very limited parking."}
{"text":"Food was really authentic.. Spring roll was yummy and Curry was indeed good.. That mild basil test was really good.. Curry was good in quantity too.."}
{"text":"I have never eat in, but do take out.  The food is very good.  In my opinion, a bit more authentic than usual.  The curries are very good.  Try something new, you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! At first, the menu was sort of disappointing because it only contained one page, nevertheless, my friend and i ordered pad thai, tom yum soup and  satay taco.  - tom yum soup was AMAZING, the flavors were blended very exquisitely! it was probably the best tom yum soup i've ever had! there's a hint of spiciness but not too spicy at the same time you can taste a hint of salt and a bit of creamy taste!  - pad thai was more than what was expected! it was unlike any other pad thai i've had at other thai restaurants. the sourness of the pad thai was not overpowering nor was the sweetness - it was just exquisite! - satay taco - the chicken was marinated and cooked well and garnished well that you could literally taste thai in that taco!  - SERVICE - overall is very good! although there is some language barrier as the servant is thai but the food is what matters"}
{"text":"The most authentic Thai food we've tried! So yummy and cheap. Our waitress Sai was awesome, very attentive. Try the pad Thai for sure. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews, I decided to grab lunch here as I work close by. I had seen some reviews mentioning that it gets super busy at lunch time (they also don't take reservations at lunch) so my friend and I ordered take out through their app. Our order was already ready when we got there at 12 which was great. We wanted to use their free Thai iced tea coupon available if you order through their app but was told that it's only for dine-in.   My friend and I both ordered the chicken pad thai ($9.95) lunch special. It came with a generous portion of pad Thai, 2 spring rolls and tom yum soup. I found the pad Thai to be quite dry and it could've used more sauce. There also wasn't enough chicken. The spring rolls were nice and crispy and soup was OK.   I'd probably come again but would try another dish."}
{"text":"Finally somewhere delicious for fresh and authentic Thai food north of Bloor/downtown. Found BKK through a neighbourhood search on Uber Eats but ate in at the restaurant. Arrived at 5:45 - just in time because they were packed half an hour later. Limited seating (maybe 25 seats including bar/window seating), nice/casual decor, friendly staff, quick service, and fantastic food. Started with the fresh rolls as an appetizers which were indeed very fresh, and came with 2 delicious dipping sauces. For our mains we shared the pad see ew (my favourite dish - always) which did not disappoint, and the Panang curry which was spiced to perfection and full of still crunchy vegetables. We got 3 more mains to go for lunch tomorrow which we look forward to enjoying!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Pretty decent street Thai restaurant with two locations in North York along Yonge Street.  Ordered the beef khao soi, chicken pad thai, chicken pad kee mao, shrimp chips, veggie fried rice, and chicken satay. Got them as takeout--they also offer delivery! All of the above cost $72 cash (10% off when you pay in cash for takeout).  Khao soi was alright--different noodles from what I've had before.  The noodles were egg noodles I believe, and I typically prefer rice noodles. The pickled radish was a good touch though.  Shrimp chips were great, with peanut sauce on the side.  Fried rice was flavourful but a bit mushy--probably from the sauce that was used. Chicken satay (5 skewers) was a bit of a disappointment--kind of dry and plain. They also served it with peanut sauce on the side. Pad thai was tasty but similar to other Thai restaurants so nothing too special, it was darker in colour than other Thai places.  Pad kee mao was alright as well, with thicker flat rice noodles.  I would probably return for takeout just because there aren't too many legit street Thai restaurants in the area. The restaurant itself is quite limited in seating and only a few parking spots are available in the plaza.  They also offer other fusion dishes which is quite interesting but didn't get to try them."}
{"text":"Simply and absolutely the best Thai food that ever existed. It's not an exaggeration. Our waiter was very courteous and service us with a smile. Everything ordered had mouth bursting flavors. I would move to Canada, just so that I can eat here. Too bad they do not have a location in NY/NJ. Kabkoon ka for the wonderful experience Eat BKK!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef massaman curry. Ew.  Beef was hard to chew. Curry was forgettable. But as subpar as the food was, the service was worse.   The two guys there just aren't good managers. After I seated myself, they gave me a water bottle and never came back. I had to walk up to them to place my order. Not very friendly at all.   I don't know why this place gets four stars. They just be getting a lot of take out. But the food isn't great either so who knows.   One star out of five.   Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food. Eat BKK has authentic tasting dishes (no ketchup based pad thai) along with some fusion stuff. And their lunch specials are really great value! Recommend the pad thai, masaman curry and Khao soi for the meals; milk roti and mango sticky rice for the desserts."}
{"text":"Decided to try this hot new place that opened just recently near Yonge and Sheppard. It is located in a small plaza next to Hero Burgers/Shell gas station. I tried the green curry with chicken. I must say that although the sauce is a little runny the flavour is quite on par and you can definitely taste the coconut milk. The green curry is labelled as a spicy dish on the menu but for someone who cannot eat a lot of spicy food I found that it was just the right level of spice and not too hot.  The down side was that the portions of chicken are quite small, and I wish that there were more pieces of chicken to mix the sauce with the rice as it was quite good.  In terms of the seats it is a small space with approximately 12 tables, 3 seats in front of the window and some side seats that i believe can seat about 5 more people. They have take out options and you can order via uber eats as well. If you decide to dine-in there is parking outside with about 4 parking spaces.  The service can be a little slow but the food is definitely delicious  Tip: check in via yelp for free shrimp chips. The shrimp chips have a strong shrimp flavour, are served warm, and come with peanut sauce.  I would give this place a 4/5 for the food but in terms of the seats I would say it is less comfortable than Khub Kao and Jajutak - 3/5. All in all I would still come back but probably for delivery or take out"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Eat BKK is North York's very own Pai. This restaurant is not big and it doesn't get the crazy line-ups as Pai and other downtown Thai restaurants, but the food is every bit as amazing. I've visited many times with friends and family, and everyone loves the food here.  Everything I've ordered off the menu, I've enjoyed 100%. The most memorable item that I order every time is the Som Tum with salted crab. It's a really refreshing papaya salad with a kick. The salted crab is not cooked so it might not be for everyone, it's easy enough to pick out. But for the adventurous ones, definitely chew on the little crab legs to get the meat out. It tastes a lot like the drunken crabs I've grown up eating. The pad see ewe and green curry are my go-to order as well but all the mains are delicious. Very flavorful, and the portions are generous. It is on the oily side but that just adds to the deliciousness. I have yet to try the desserts since I'm always too stuffed by the end of the meal. I also havn't tried the items in the fusion section but I'm excited to try in the future.  They've recently joined a bunch of the restaurant apps and is a good option for take-out or delivery. But for those who visit the restaurant, they have a 10% cash discount. Don't let the fact that it's located off to the side in a plaza that doesn't get much foot traffic stop you from trying this place."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends this past Friday based on location and Yelp reviews. Just a heads up that the parking lot is also tiny with a handful of spots and a few reserved for the businesses next door. There is street parking available nearby as well.   Upon walking in, it's definitely a smaller space with less than a dozen tables so a reservation is definitely recommended to avoid waiting. My friend was easily able to make a reservation on the same day for 6 people around 8 p.m. considering it was a Friday night and constantly busy with people dining or picking up take out orders while we were there.   There were several choices on the menu - no shortage of variety here! I ordered the pork belly dish which was recommended by our server. It came with a sunny side up egg, rice and some veggies in a savoury, medium spicy sauce. That sauce definitely made the dish as it would have just been plain pork belly and veggies without it. It was tasty and a good portion for around $12. I also ordered the Thai iced tea for around $3, which was nothing to complain about but I've tasted better elsewhere.   My friends ordered the panang curry with beef, pad gra prow and pineapple fried rice - all of which were huge portions in comparison to mine and apparently delicious. All of the dishes were under $14 from what I remember. I wish I had room to try other dishes here but it's another excuse to visit again in the future!  Service was friendly and had no issues with us having separate bills when it came time to paying. My #1 Thai place is still probably Pai but we had a great dining experience here! I would recommend coming here if you're in the area and want to try a different Thai place for a change!"}
{"text":"I came back to try the khao soi poutine and it was delicious!! An excellent Asian fusion dish. So savoury and full of flavour. Their fries are thick and crispy. If anyone here is a fan of Costco fries, it's similar but slightly more crispy. I'm so happy I ordered it!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner around 5 pm on a Tuesday and I already saw \"reserved\" on a lot of the tables. I got the panaeng curry ($10.95) and my boyfriend got pad Thai. Both dishes were really good and I thought they were reasonably priced. The panaeng curry isn't my favourite at this location but it was still very tasty! The pad Thai is one of the better pad Thai I've had in the GTA. I would come back here if only parking wasn't so bad. The service here was decent too."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and it was very good! The restaurant is in an unassuming plaza but the food delivered. Unfortunately I did not note the name of the dish that I had, but it is a curry noodle dish where half the noodles are soft and the other half is hard and crunchy. It was a rather unique experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would come back for a casual dinner with family or friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service! The mango salad is better than anywhere else I've ordered from (it's actually made from ripe mangoes!) and all the curry options are excellent. Everything I've ordered here was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. It's a welcome addition to this neighbourhood and I plan to return frequently. Every time I visit I'm impressed, even though it's a simple menu and small location. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tried too hard to just take tiny advantages off customer. The taste was above average but the people there.......We ordered pad kra pao kai dao, mango salad and roti.   The guy came after us ordered the same pad kra pao kai dao too and he got his dish way before we did. Then we were served with a roti with syrup all over it. We thought it's just sth they do in this restaurant so we started eating. After eating one piece, the dish turned out too sweet for us, even after we swept most of the sauce away. Then we took a look at the menu and realized that they made a mistake by giving us milk roti instead of just roti. So we brought attention to our waiter and he was like \"ok\" then just went and grab a plain one.  Then  the pad kra pao kai dao came, without fried egg and kai dao means fried egg... then our waiter went all \"ah, ok\" again and went to the back and brought the egg to us. It was hard to not think that they happens to \"forgot\" it.  I have to say I was not very surprised to see both roti dishes appeared on my bill. When I asked why, he said I should've stop eating when I took my first bit into the milk roti. Just so done talking to this guy, so I just paid and never come back."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Tried the shrimp pad Thai, red curry beef and green curry beef. Portions are fairly generous. A tad overpriced. You pay extra to add meat/chicken/shrimp to various dishes."}
{"text":"I need to start by saying that parking here is an absolute disaster, so avoid driving at all costs.   As for the food - it was good! Here aren't many Thai spots in North York so it was nice to see this place open up.  I got the Khao Soi with beef which was very good. It was very rich and flavourful - up to par with the Khao Soi that I've tried at other Thai places downtown. The beef was easy to eat as it was off the bone.  My brother got the yellow curry, which was also very good. It was fairly spicy for someone like myself who can only handle a little bit of heat.  We also got the free shrimp chips with the Yelp check-in. I wasn't crazy about this. The peanut sauce was nice but the chips tasted like cardboard.   Overall, this is a great addition to North York. I will probably only take out from here in the future and will definitely be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Environment: A stuffy and cramped space combined with the absence of air conditioning, you'll sure work up a sweat.   Parking: A small parking available in the front of the restaurant however it is shared between neighbouring restaurants/stores, so definitely limited.   Service: One of the server was inattentive and actually walked out while we were placing the order to pick up a phone call (cell phone NOT business phone). Order wasn't exactly placed in/got lost in the kitchen somewhere. Waited about 20 minutes before we asked for a status check on our order then waited another 10 minutes or so before our food arrived. No apologies or explanations offered during the wait. Server had audacity to ask for tips and was not too happy. I wasn't either, as a customer.   Food: My bf ordered the Khao Soi Siam and I ordered the Ramen Tom Yum. Both were decent, though nothing to write home about and not deserving of a return trip.  * Pictures on the menu would've been useful."}
{"text":"The food is good (not great) but decent.  The portion size is fantastic and quite generous.  The service was just ok.  It's good if you're in the area, but not something to go out of your way for"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few coworkers as it was a new place in the area. It's a pretty small place inside but good thing we went after the lunch hour rush. Got free app from the yelp check in.  Pretty much the whole table ended up getting the green curry with chicken. It had a little bit of a kick but nothing out of the ordinary. Flavour of the curry resembles the green curry from khao san road. Everyone enjoyed the food except for one who got the pad thai. They said it didn't really taste like pad thai - more like pad see ew but with thinner noodles. Would like to try out some of their other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Small cute little restaurant with some pretty good Thai!! I've been here twice. Had the Pad Thai the first time, flavour was just right. It's not like Be careful with spice level, I went for the medium and was breathing fire.  Today, I went for their lunch special. I got the green curry chicken with rice. It also came with a hot and sour soup and 2 spring rolls. Very filling lunch! Only $10! The curry was very good! Lightly creamy with one good spice. Filled with lots of bamboo, peppers and chicken!! Loving it!!!  The staff there are super friendly!!! I've only done take out and I can say it's a very efficient system. Order online, tell them when you expect to arrive (asap or certain time), show up and the food is there, ready to go!  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick meal and decent Thai!!"}
{"text":"The pas tai wasn't so great, it didn't taste fresh and was too greasy and tasted and smelled like reheated oil, like old cooking oil. The green curry tasted good but again I felt that it was not so fresh. The wall art is cool, the place is small so mind that you may need to wait there. It is still the best tai food you can find between Sheppard to steels, but not the best quality. I think they're best dish among the 4 we ordered, was the green curry, no complaints on that. The only thing is they cleaned the table with a cloth that smelled bad. Service is not the best. They brought 3 dishes at once and the pas tai after we all finished most of our food."}
{"text":"I really dislike giving scathing reviews but I terms of this place I think I am doing a public  service. Maybe they're OK for dining in the restaurant but I doubt it. So I ordered from there last week. And every dish was horrid. The pad thai was just a bunch of stuck together flavourless nonsense.  I can make better at home frankly. The whole mess was $75 bucks and I just felt ripped off. Even the rice I ordered was wrong and they sent shitty not even Jasmine or sticky rice instead. I called to query and suddenly there was a language  barrier. Frankly....worst meal EVER."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a long time, and I finally got chance to check it out. It is near yonge and sheppard but it's in a little awkwardly placed in a small plaza on south of Sheppard. First pf all I loved their interior. They characterized icons of Thailandb and flag banners on the ceilings were really cute. Although space is very limited so it's not suitable for big groups.  Food was also amazing. I usually get pad thai from pho places since there aren't much thai restaurants in north york, and this place became my goto place for pad thai if I have to stay in North york. Very flavorful and portion is also generous. Also had Chicken green curry. Chicken wasn't dry and it came out in a big bowl. Will definately come back with a bigger group ( one 6 person table ) so I can try more of their food"}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai was satisfying and sauced up just right that it ain't drowning  but it ain't missing the KAPOW factor!  We opted for lunch specials, so it came with this sour and spicy soup that's got some kick to it, with tofu, mushrooms and some bamboo shoots. Spicier than your average soup served at restaurants so be sure to take a few sips before diving in as this may destroy your tastebuds for the upcoming main.  Price was reasonable considering Yonge st real estate is shooting through the roof. Parking minimal but great for subway goers making a pit stop takeout before heading home.   It is condo central so I can understand why they are renovating the place for more seating space, so dining in during the next few days might add 'construction sound effects' to your background playlist. But the flavours will take you to a clean plate fast, with a belch and the bill and you're off!"}
{"text":"I've had this restaurant bookmarked for quite a while now and we were finally in the neighbourhood and craving Thai food.   The parking situation isn't the greatest in the plaza, as it's quite small and there are quite a few other stores using the same lot. The restaurant isn't as small as I thought it would be, but the tables are quite close to each other. All of this is okay considering the location on Yonge street.   We ordered the fresh spring rolls, Tom yum soup, chicken Penang (my usual) and the pad kee mao. The soup was quite good. The pad kee mao was quite large and tasted fine, but similarly to my Penang...it was lacking some flavours. I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted my meal to be, even though I noticed later that I had the option to make it spicier...so that was a bit disappointing. Regardless, the curry sauce was quite good.   As we finished our meal, I realized that we never received our spring rolls. We received our bill and of course the spring rolls were on it. So, we informed our waiter that we never received them. He had been out of the restaurant I'm not sure how many times, so never really came to check on us or make sure we had everything we had ordered. The waiter quickly returned with a new bill.   There are quite a few really great thai places in the city, so I was hoping for more from Eat BBK Thai given all of the reviews. Though I truly enjoyed the decor, I don't think it tops my list of Thai places to eat."}
{"text":"Food and service are both OK. Lucky they don't have a real good Thai food competitor around in North York otherwise their existence could have been non existential. Lol. In a nutshell, everything is average. For example: They will not modify your food according to your ask ( I have requested them several times to make the crispy pork \"crispy\" but they always have a reason on why they cannot do. Also they will not give disposable plates and napkins because regardless of your asks. Either way, thumbs down for both for food and service."}
{"text":"Must try: Pad Kra Prao Kai Dao  This restaurant caused a little apprehension on the drive there (being new and all), but it turned out to be a pleasant dining experience (parking aside).   The Shrimp cracker was a very nice starter, we checked in on yelp with ease and got a generous plate of it. The highlight was the peanut sauce that came with it. The Green Curry was very good, flavourful and filled with ingredients. I like the fact that it came in a big bowl, so you can mix the rice at will. With that dish, I was excited for everything else after. The Pad See Ewe with beef was solid as well, nice textured noodles with good blend of sauce. It's not extremely kid friendly, as the chinese broccoli is slightly bitter to the taste, but even so my little brother devoured it. My favorite was the Pad Kra Prao Kai Dao, which was I believe minced meat cooked with basil, pappers, onions, and maybe other herbs and veggies, served with a side of rice and a golden fried egg. The flavour of the meat was just so perfect... it was spicy as well, which went well with the rice. I love friend egg on anything, so that just made me happy all by itself. The only dish that was iffy was the Massaman Curry, but to this day I can't tell if it was due to personal preference, or actual technical screw-up. The curry was nicely flavoured, but the potato in the dish *appear to be* undercooked. It was hard... a little translucent... and the curry had not soaked in at all. Now you can maybe argue that it was cooked... and they just like their potato on the firmer side, but I don't know, I was put off. They did try to bring us a new one after we requested (maybe a mistake... never send food back they say), but it was still a little on the firmer side.   Anyways, it was a good experience, 3/4 dishes were on point. The service was quick but when we went there was only one other table. I like the decor and the lighting, it's clean and white and cute, nothing to complain about. If you are in the area, you should give Eat BKK a try, it will definitely satisfy your thai cravings."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  Fast and convenient, I walked in one day and ordered the pad thai. The restaurant is really cool and trendy looking. It's a small place  but was pretty empty when I walked in. Not sure if it gets busier on the weekends or peak dinner periods. I ordered to-go so I didn't really have a chance to experience the service but the lady taking my order was pretty nice and offered me a seat while I waited for my food.  I believe I only waited around 5-10 minutes so that was good. I got the vegetable pad thai and it was pretty good! I kind of likened it to Thai Express, which I know sounds bad but I actually really like that Pad Thai. I must say, the price is almost the same as well. The serving was generous, I definitely could not finish the whole thing, but I didn't find it to be outstanding. It was a bit less sweet than some pad thai dishes I've had in the past and didn't have that weird red colour that most have. The ingredients tasted fresh and there were a lot of vegetables.   The reason for 3 stars is that I just didn't find the meal to be all that memorable. I see that they have some interesting fusion dishes like spaghetti and tacos and a night market section on the menu and maybe that's where they excel. It was definitely on par with most Thai restaurants I've had, but I didn't find it to be exceedingly amazing. Maybe my mistake was ordering the most cliche item on the menu, I would definitely come back and try one of the more adventurous dishes next time!   Prices are quite reasonable, it's definitely one of the less expensive options in the area and they have a 10% discount if you pay cash. Lunch specials are also a good deal, around $10 with a drink and spring roll!"}
{"text":"Som Tom and Pad Thai are my favorite dishes. Restaurant has nice decorations on walls. Great staffs!"}
{"text":"Updated review: Much better experience overall. Would definitely consider going back for their Pad Thai and mango sticky rice!!!!   Food - the food was fairly good. I ordered Khao Soi while my friend ordered the Green curry. We also got complimentary shrimp chips with the satay peanut sauce.   Compared to other Khao Soi, it was a little bland in flavour but the portions were huge for what you paid for. I finished about a half and was already full. Had a taste of the green curry, more on the curry less on the coconut side. Rich in flavour and you could choose the spice.  The shrimp chips were just alright, peanut sauce was good but wasn't a fan. Would probably go back to taste the other things on the menu to spike curiosity.   Service- because they're new I gave them a little lee-way. They did mess up my friends order as she ordered beef green curry but got chicken... I asked for a take out container for my drink but they didn't have one. Also, they didn't entirely wait for me to finish my order as I had to interrupt them when they were walking away to add another item. A little bit of improvement to be done, but good start.   Drinks - their iced tea is a bit bland but okay overall. Had better.   Parking- tight limited space. Not sure where to park if all spots were taken. Just a heads up!   Overall, would give this place an 'alright' but wanna check out other items."}
{"text":"Rating would definitely be different if I have not been to Khao San Road downtown or Pai.  Was looking forward to the Khao soi but it was lacking some heat (temp wise) and something else. The flavors were there and lots of meat as well just didn't have that wow to it which Khao San Road had on me. The noodles also weren't as good as Khao San Road downtown but bkk Seems to have a wider variety of content including some pickled raddish.   We had the fried morning glory, looked good and flavors were there but a tad too much Batter I think. Next time will get the normal one.   Thai iced tea was good, pad Thai and pad see Ew was good too. Great portions, great service and nice atmosphere.   However unfortunately nothing really wowed us so that is the only reason for a low rating."}
{"text":"Probably won't be coming back anytime soon because of my most recent visit. Service wasn't good, food was mediocre, and was disappointed that the lunch special wasn't available on the weekends.   They should really update that on their websites because the last time we visited was during a weekend lunch special.  This is my third visit to eat bkk and compared to other Thai restaurants, this ranked as one of the lowest for me.  I came here with my family during a busy Sunday lunch service. Dad ordered the mango salad, sister ordered the green curry with chicken, and bf had the spaghetti curry.  All of their orders arrived efficiently, but none of them were thoroughly impressed with their meals. They commented that the food was good, but nothing noteworthy and they would get something different if they were to come back.  As for me ... my meal took over 25 mins AFTER everyone else had already received their meals. I just sat there waiting for my meal. Yeah, not impressed because I ended up eating after everyone else had already finished.  I ordered the khao Soi Chicken and it was okay. Again, nothing spectacular. The curry wasn't as aromatic as I would have liked it - I could only taste the coconut milk and some mild spices.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed by this location, service, and the food here. Not impressed."}
{"text":"As a die hard Thai Food fan, I've wanted to try this place for so long and finally did! I had Basil Braise Beef Kai Dao 4.5/5 - this dish is such a delightful alternative to what you usually would order at a thai restaurant. The flavours certainly brings me back to Thailand and a dish my uncle makes. The beef is so tender, it is a soy sauce based with 5 spices which is more common in Chinese cuisine. Larb Pork 3.5/5 I personally like a more authentic, cold and tangy version more but the one they make here is a good alternative! They put a generous amount of toasted rice powder to the dish.  I also had their Som Tum 3.5/5 with marinated crab, the crab was not mashed to release the flavour but was mix into the papaya salad. I find it a bit too sweet and the waiter did not ask how spicy we wanted. My friends had a pad see ew which tasted very aromatic in terms of the way they stir fried the noodle. The red curry panang has a rather strong peanut flavour than the ones you usually get, its a good change if you are getting bored! This is an authentic Thai Restaurant that I will try again"}
{"text":"Khao Soi Poutine ($7.95) This poutine was really good! I would say a must get. Originally when I saw pictures online I didn't look too appealing but I'm glad we ordered it. The beef was like eating braised beef brisket - the meat was so tender! It had a decent 3 big pieces. The fries were crispy and more importantly, the curry sauce was the killer. We actually mixed our rice with the leftover curry sauce after finishing the fries.  Pad Kee Mao ($10.95 + $2 for meat) Flat rice noodles cooked with eggs, bell peppers, green beans, basil, and baby pepper corn. This was actually quite spicy. There was something about this dish that had some sort of spice which I did not like, but I can't exactly describe it. Maybe it was the baby pepper corn. Lots of ingredients which was nice, but quite expensive for what you get. I would suggest just sticking to the Pad Thai instead, it probably is more flavorful.  Pad Kraprao Kai Dao (12.95) Chicken cooked with basil, onions, and peppers, served with rice and topped with a fried egg. Although it doesn't look too appetizing, it actually tasted really good! Surprisingly better than the rice noodles that we ordered. The meat was really flavorful and the veggies were nice and crunchy adding nice texture with the soft chicken.  Remember to check in on Yelp to get your free shrimp chips & satay peanut sauce! At the beginning I didn't care so much about it thinking it's probably just the ones old in the supermarket, but I'm glad we tried it - the shrimp chips were surprisingly really good and amazing with the sauce.  Overall the food here was good, but slightly expensive."}
{"text":"pretty good Thai food. Chicken pad Thai was a bit bland. Beef Panang curry was good. Skip the egg noodle in the soup the portion is too small.  The chicken satay skewers are good but again portion is small compared to the price. Great mango sticky rice for dessert. Small tiny roti for $2!   In general flavours are good just small portions and very little meat within the small portion. 4 stars for flavours. We will try elsewhere next."}
{"text":"This place was legit! Everything we had was good. We had chicken wings and tofu taro fries to start. The chicken wings were good, but the fries left a little something to be desired. Maybe I would have liked a thicker dipping sauce or something more vinegary, but for the most part they were a little bland.  Everything else was bomb! The spaghetti curry was so good. I had my doubts about it, but one bite and I was in heaven. The pad Thai is good, the Tom yum soup is good, and the soft shell crab was good. Everything was good.   I don't think you can go wrong with any of the main dishes. The price was a little higher, but Thai food is normally a little more expensive. I would have no complaints about ever coming back here. I just wish I could find more words to describe this place. Just try it out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very authentic. The wings were bomb! Good portions, good price. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place this evening with my wife and overall, I would say the food was average.  I ordered the spicy pad thai chicken and my wife had the pad kee mao.  For starters, we ordered a tom yum shrimp soup and a papaya salad with salted crab.  The starters were good but beware that if you order the papaya salad with salted crab, you better be able to handle your spiciness level because that dish was flaming hot!  I love eating spicy foods but even I felt like I could of blown a ball of fire out of my mouth like a dragon! Where this place lost points was in my chicken pad thai dish.  It was edible but the noodles were overcooked which caused the entire dish to be a bit soggy and for some reason it tasted a bit too sweet.  For dessert we had the mango sticky rice and boy was that delicious! The rice was nice and soft and the coconut milk was a great balance to the fresh mango slices.  We would definitely recommend everyone to try this dessert!  Service was good.  Parking was a bit tricky since it was in a super small area with very limited parking spots.  Not a lot of good Thai places in the Yonge and Finch /Yonge and Sheppard area so we would return for our Thai fixes in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was pretty good. Finally, Kao Soi on the menu and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Place was decorated nicely, and the food looks good. Keyword \"looks\". Ordered takeout with the place half full and 40 minutes later still waiting. Asked the server at the counter to check the kitchen for status, and she just said that its coming without moving. Meanwhile people who came after us have already gotten their food, takeout or eat-in. Seriously?  Update: Food was quite nice actually."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place. It's like a hole in the wall located in a plaza with nothing much going on, but when you go inside, you see a really unique space with neat Thai-themed decor on the wall. The area is a bit cramped though... so it's not a place you'd wanna settle down and get comfy with a group of people.  I had the chicken green curry and it was quite good. The spring rolls were decent, nothing to write home about. Portion sizes are fair, but if you're a big eater, you'll wanna order more. Solid place for take-out!"}
{"text":"Fast service, cute place in the neighborhood.  Tom yum Soup was delicious and same with the main dish I had. One thing I would not recommend as it was way too oily and soaking in oil, was the deep fried water spinach. the menu doesnt say that it will be deep fried, but if you are looking healthy vegetables, and order that you will be in for a shock."}
{"text":"Came here to get some veggie options. Green curry and veggie fresh rolls were really good. The Pad kraprao Kai dao wasn't crap . The level of spice is pretty mild here and portion sizes are good.   Location is fairly small, so make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after reading all these reviews. Got the chicken pad thai and sticky mango rice. Everything is fresh and good. The food came out"}
{"text":"I do believe in second chance so when my friend asked me out for a lunch date at EatBkk, I am IN!  Lunch special still a good value for $10.95. We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Basil Crispy Pork Belly.  Sadly, the pork belly was so dried and hard. Nothing crispy at all, but maybe the rice all the side? The white rice was hard and cold and undercooked. Thai rice is one of my favorite rice and this is just disappointing.  Thai Spicy request was met with a lazy effort from the Kitchen by just throwing a spoonful of dried chili on top. (I wish for fresh chili or the seed of fresh chili)  Luckily Fried Morning Glory saved the day! This is probably the only dish I would have ordered next time. Papaya Salad over Morning Glory Fritter. So insanely good! Though lack the spiciness but easily solved by some pickled Thai Chili on the side.  Maybe I will be back again. Maybe my friend would invite me to join her for lunch? Just rest assured that I will be ordering more Morning Glory!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was recommended by a friend.  Tried it out yesterday.  Place was very busy and very humid inside.  We started with the shrimp chips and peanut sauce.  The chips are very generous size.  The problem is,  the sauce that comes with it is barely is enough for 5 chips.  If you want more, they charge you an additional $1 for it.  Why don't they just increase the portion of sauce and charge more for the dish. I hate when they nickel and dime you.  The chicken satay was good.  The pad sew was inedible.  Weird, fishy/tinny taste.  The green chicken curry was so spicy and watery you needed to tone down the fire with lots of rice.  Disappointing...."}
{"text":"Eat BKK is a solid restaurant that serves some interesting fusion foods in addition to the traditional thai cuisine. The restaurant itself is small, with 6-7 tables and very limited parking space. But the decor is chic and clean. Ive been to this place quite a few times, and i have not been disappointed.  Im a huge fan of their spaghetti curry; imagine long strands of pasta dunked into spicy, hearty and savoury curry, carrying all that flavour into your mouth in a slurpy mess. I also liked their basil crispy pork kai do, and pad thai (cant go wrong at all). Whats also worth mentioning is their curries. Ive had both their red and green curry, and I've got to say its very close to the ones I've had in Thailand. Love the red curry especially, plus they let you decide on the spice level.   Definite recommend. You gotta eat here."}
{"text":"I've both ordered via UberEats and sat in at the venue, enjoyed both experiences!  I have a deep love for curry of all kinds, and tried all of theirs except the yellow because... yellow curry is so boring. The flavor is definitely there in the dishes I tried and the fresh ingredients in the curry are plentiful as well. Their curry tends to be on the sweet side and some people prefer more savory. I personally enjoy sweet coconut curry so I had no complaints. My favorites are the green and panaeng.  I have yet to try their other offerings bc I can never say no to curry when it is on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time as my friend had been raving about this place. For Thai food, pad thai is a must so got that with chicken and ordered Tom Yum soup.   Was fairly disappointed with the pad Thai. Their noodles were over cooked so it lacked texture. Chicken was a bit dry. Wasn't impressed at all with this dish.  Tom Yum soup was warm and taste was mediocre.  Service was alright and food came pretty quick.  So far I'm giving this place 3/5 as I just came back from Thailand not too long ago. Will try their other items next time to see if it will change my rating."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5/5. My fav dishes here are the morning glory and the pad sew . There dishes are more on the sweet side, especially the green curry and Khao soi"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Thai restaurants you can find in Toronto!   The food was actually quite similar to the food I had in Bangkok when I visited last year, such a little hole in the wall neighbourhood gem!   Worth the hike to north York especially when there are so many disappointments or overrated downtown Thai places."}
{"text":"On Sunday April 8th, I visited this restaurant and it has been one of the worst experiences I've ever had. There was no greeting or acknowledgement as we walked inside the store. The server simply pointed towards our seats and requested us to sit down. Next, she threw the menus at us and came around to our table within two minutes asking us to order. I'm not too sure, but 2 minutes doesn't seem like a whole lot of time for someone to order (especially if it's our first visit). Nonetheless we ordered a couple of appetizers and mains. One of the apps we ordered was the Thai Wings. Initially it seemed perfectly fine, but as I pulled out my wing an enormous strand of hair also followed. It was a disgusting sight to bear (but it made sense since no one in the kitchen was wearing a hair net). Frustrated at this, I showed the server the strand of hair in our food and she didn't seem to care at all. There was no sympathy, no apology, no sort of acknowledgement, no reaction at all. She rudely asked if we wanted another order and kept running around. Now, I've been to a handful of restaurants where this has happened, but none of them have acted in this manner. They would apologize and show some sort of care for their customer. But this was waitress was simply rude. She smirked at us and asked us what we wanted to do. Horrified by the experience, we paid our bills and left this restaurant as soon as possible. As I walked out, I could get a sense of what this restaurant was all about. It was primarily driven by getting customers in and out the door as quickly as they could, with no respect or care for its customers. It's one thing for a restaurant to serve bad food, but to serve poor customer service, well that's just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Located near Sheppard and Yonge, Eat Bkk Thai Kitchen is a great option for food if you ever want some authentic Thai food. The parking in the plaza is not great so if you live around the area it's even better to walk over. I came by with my boyfriend on Saturday night where I made reservations in advanced. When I arrived at 7pm, the place was half full and I was glad I made reservations as it got busier. The restaurant is not big and maybe fits around 30 people.  In terms of food my boyfriend and I shared three dishes. We got the Fried Morning Glory salad to start and shared the pad see ewe (with chicken) and the pad kraprao kai dao (with ground beef). The friend morning glory was delicious, nothing like I've ever had before. Definitely a great dish - crunchy, sweet, sour, crispy, and refreshing. Huge portions too which left me half full already before we started on our main courses. The pad see ewe had great flavour and depth to it, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and didn't want to stop eating it! The kraprao kai dao is what you would expect, and they don't hold back on the spice either. Great dishes in terms of price, portion, and flavour. We both couldn't finish the food and had to pack some home.  Service could have been better throughout the entire meal. There was 2 staff on the floor taking care of all the tables and so it was a bit confusing when no one greeted me at the door at first. Also, trying to find someone to get the bill after we finished eating also took longer than usual. Other than that, the food is good and I would come back to try more dishes (or get takeout)."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Food is so good here!!! Most authentic Thai restaurant around this neighbourhood hands down. Especially love all their noodle dishes!!"}
{"text":"It's the best Thai restaurant in Toronto! It's been there almost every weekend! The food is fresh, healthy?lovely and authentic. The service is also very good ! if you love Thai food ! You must go there to try everything !"}
{"text":"I ordered the Masaman Curry Beef $10 lunch special for takeout.  As I was walking back to the office, I dropped it on the ground and saw the curry sauce start to leak into the bag... oh well, I thought, should still be good.  In the office... I opened up the bag and began eating out of what was formally my takeout container... The curry was sooo damn good.  As I was approaching the end of my meal, I started feeling sad because of all the wasted curry sauce in the bag... I almost started to spoon the sauce out of the bag... I didn't though... damn office etiquettes...   The meal came with spring rolls - meh... and some soup which had a nice flavourful spicy kick.    Also ordered the Thai Iced Tea.  they had put it in a hard plastic soup container so it survived the fall.  Lucky!  Damn Thai iced tea is so good.  So sweet and creamy.  I didn't even care that people saw me drinking \"soup\" with a straw.  Highly recommend!   Also, the place fills up very quickly.  I'd suggest coming early if you're eating in."}
{"text":"Checked out this new restaurant because I really missed the Thai street food I got in Thailand. Their decor is lovely - they have this map of the Bangkok Skytrain system which was a really nice touch. The Thai Iced Tea was nice but a little on the sweet side. My boyfriend got the Tom Yum Ramen and I got the Beef Kaprao. One word of caution: I love spicy food but their extra spicy was REALLY spicy so maybe stay away from it. I always love to get the spiciest option because I see it as a challenge but it was reaallly a bit much here.   Will definitely be back to try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"Of all the Thai places I have eaten at, I'd definitely have to say that this one takes the cake.  I have eaten here twice:  The first time we ordered green curry, coconut sticky rice (absolutely divine!), pad krap rao kai dao, and roti.  The green curry was very tasty. It was slightly sweet and not too overly spicy. The ingredients were very fresh and the vegetables were done al dente (perfect!). The curry had various tastes but it all blended together very nicely.  The coconut rice was so delicious in and of itself! I could have eaten that by itself and I probably would've been a happy camper. That's how good it is! If you are a coconut lover, like myself, you are definitely in for a treat.  The roti was perfectly done. Crispy but soft. The texture was perfect and it paired well with the green curry.  I did not eat much of the pad krap rao kai dao, so I cannot make a proper assessment.   The second time we ordered veggie fresh rolls, tom yum soup, red curry, pad thai, and coconut rice.  The veggie fresh rolls were definitely fresh. The rice paper rolls were rolled nicely in that it did not fall apart or stick together. The peanut sauce was delicious.  Similar to the green curry, the red curry was also delicious for the same reasons.  The pad thai was very well done. It was not the 'very red ketchup-y' kind that you get at, say, Thai Express. It was very tasty and the noodles don't stick together like some other pad thais I have eaten in the past.  After all the comments on the food, I want to express how great the service is. Everyone here is super friendly. The second time we came, we ordered coconut sticky rice, but the waitress misheard us and gave us just coconut rice. We realized that it was incorrect and we informed the waiter. We told them we did not want it to be taken off our bill, and that we just wanted to order one order of coconut sticky rice. However, while paying the bill, we realized they took off the two orders of coconut rice. What a pleasant surprise, as we specifically told them that we want to pay for the rice.  TLDR;  this place is amazing, the service is friendly and great, the food is absolutely delicious - seasoned and cooked to perfection!  I am and will continue to be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Don't come late afternoon, it's their lunch time and neglect their customers. Music is so loud, this isn't your room or a club. No parking. Small portions. Overpriced. Terrible attitude. There are better Thai places to go to. Wish I could love this restaurant, but I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city. I loved their tom yam soup. Must try the fried morning glory appetizer, its deep fried leafy vegetable, crunchy, sweet and salty. I demolished the whole plate."}
{"text":"The food at this place was pretty great, authentic and fresh,(the vegetarian dishes at least) the meat dishes weren't as great the meat didn't taste fresh, a little rubbery and had a freezer taste. The restaurant manager or owner refused to honor a yelp check in offer for a free appetizer saying it had expired, which wasn't indicated anywhere so that wasn't nice. Small restaurant, average decor.  Four stars because the food really was that good, just be wary of the meat."}
