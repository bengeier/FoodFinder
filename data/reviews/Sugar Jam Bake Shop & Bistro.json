{"text":"This place is amazing! I work right down the street and I have been here twice within the last week, the second time I brought seven other people with me and they all raved about their Boss Hog and brisket sandwiches. The pulled pork mac and cheese is also to die for. One commentator, who is originally from a town that does a lot of BBQ said that this was the best bbq sandwich he had had in Arizona! I have to agree. The warm, friendly environment and the fact that this is not a chain have put SugarJam on the go-to list for myself and my coworkers. Can't wait to try their Saturday brunch!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have enjoyed lunch here. The tomato basil bisque was delicious and she loved the panini. The baked goods are out of this world! The brownies and pies were absolutely perfect. My daughter has a severe nut allergy but was able to eat both after checking with Dana, the owner. Thanks Dana!"}
{"text":"Purchased 2 Mississippi mud brownies and some classic chocolate chip cookies tonight at their booth at First Friday in Phoenix. Not only is the food phenomenal, but the lady I spoke with seemed truly passionate about her craft. The food is baked with love and that's the best part! I can't wait to visit the shop and order some pies!!"}
{"text":"Just got a caramel explosion brownie at their booth at the First Friday Art Walk in downtown Phx. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Dana and Sugar Jam team, thank you for the gorgeous Beach Boys-themed cake you made for us with virtually no advanced notice! We absolutely love it...and we devoured your warm sweet potato pie en route to the celebration. You saved the day! (\"God only knows what we'd be without you...\")"}
{"text":"Came in after reading the other reviews and they are all right. This is some of the best food I have had with a nice small cafe feel. The food is al made fresh and the owner even took the time to make her mac n cheese differently for my children so it would be less spicy. I will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I have been looking for years for a great pie shop. My husband loves fruit pies, and for his birthday I searched high and low for a place that would meet his standards. I ordered him the summer peach pie for his birthday yesterday, and he was blown away! He absolutely loved it and was raving about it. It came out of the oven hot and was ready on time for pickup. Can't wait to go back and try their food and some mini pies!"}
{"text":"Truly a layer of love goes into every morsel of the food you eat at this adorably sweet little find!
Greeted by Luke (awesome guy) who found it very difficult to select one of the items on this exceptional menu to recommend because Everything was truly that delicious ...I say this because once I made my selection of the croissant homemade chicken salad with walnuts and raspberries (to die for)! He graciously greeted me with tasters of there home made rubbed briskets,pulled pork & sauces samples. YumYum!!
Crazy delicious!
In addition I couldn't leave without taking with me a cookie a home-baked caramel chocolate chip cookie ...Wow no words!!!  :-))
Super cute Decour, very clean and absolutely a must stop by!!!
Must be a big hit by many ...because the owner who spend some time chatting with me (very delightful) is very excited to announce her expansion!
Enjoy all the culinary delights Sugar Jam has to offer!!!
Tip-The owner said that there is a specialty that she cooks only on Saturdays... it's a French toast culinary delight. I'm headed back for sure!!!
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Love this place! Wonderful food! And a neighborhood like place. Always try and remember! Great Applewood Smoked Pulled Pork Sandwich!!! Try them out!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. The BBQ brisket sandwich is as good as any brisket I have ever tasted. Truly a hidden gem of a lunch spot!"}
{"text":"We are spending the weekend here in Scottsdale and we're looking for a place for brunch/lunch.  As usual, I consulted Yelp and found this place that was rated 5 stars!  Personally, I have never had the pleasure of visiting a 5 star restaurant .  I read the reviews and saw the pics and quickly wazed our way there!  

Upon walking into Sugar Jam, I immediately liked the atmosphere.  Decor was very eclectic and interesting.  The menu was not too large, but we still had difficult making our choices - everything was so tempting.  Upon speaking with our waiter, he mentioned the biscuits and gravy dish - which we had never tried.  We ordered one for the table to share - and it was absolutely delicious!!!  All our meals were phenomenal.  We were visited by both the chef and the owner during our lunch which made our experience that much more delightful!   They gave us a sample of their sea salt caramel cookies and we were hooked.  Obviously, we left with a variety of goodies to have for later!!  So glad our son is attending ASU so we will have the opportunity to go back !!  Definitely worthy of a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious.  Specifically, I had the applewood smoked pork in the SJ breakfast.  They were out of the French toast at 11AM on a Saturday, which was disappointing, particularly because it is a house specialty.  Once I tasted the pulled pork, I did not mind that they were out of the French toast.  The service was somewhat slow (seemed like a short- staff day), and it is not clear at first that you need to choose a table, then order at the counter - so if it's crowded, be sure and snag a table first.  

The baked goods look incredible - taking some home!  Atmosphere is very fun also!  

Will definitely return regularly, as the few downfalls are far outweighed by the food!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I flew here from Minnesota to visit Grandpa and Grandma. What a wonderful surprise we arrived to when our family pulled out a custom chocolate cake with delicious buttercream frosting. The flowers on top were the perfect touch to celebrate my wife's birthday given she has a green thumb. Yum! Yum! 

We will be back for the brisket next trip."}
{"text":"Visiting Scotsdale since Monday and we finally found the most friendliest, welcoming staff since we arrived. Then we had the most delicious brunch since arriving. This establishment is off the beaten path but is a true gem.  Don't miss out on the quaint atmosphere. Friendly and inviting owner and staff, fresh baked goods and outstanding food."}
{"text":"Wow!  Somebody here knows how to cook!  Everything is homemade. This is just a jewel of a restaurant, fronted by very friendly nice people."}
{"text":"When you're right your right. All the reviews are correct! Amazing food, amazing service and food is delicious. Lunch was perfect! Got a special cake made for my moms bday and it looks spectacular. Dana made it even more special by adding a layer as it was her 50th cake made. Great find! Will be headed back soon."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering a beautiful and super moist, delicious cake from Sugar Jam! And this time when we picked up the second cake, we tasted their yummy home-cooked food from their Bistro! Dana and her husband have a wonder business with outstanding food and adorable d√©cor! 

My daughters had the French toast which was so delicious and I had a the chicken cranberry-walnut salad on a toasted croissant. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and my dad the biscuits and sausage gravy! ALL so wonderful, tasty & fresh! 

You need to visit this hidden gem for all their baked good treasures! From cute fruit pies, cookies to scones and our personal fav, birthday cakes! I've finally found the love of my \"East Coast Deliciousness\" right here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Tried the Parisian French toast. -  delicious with bourbon pecan syrup    Biscuits and gravy are always perfect with just the right amount of sage.  Thoughtful  and prompt service."}
{"text":"Amazing pies, even if you're not a true pie lover, you'll appreciate their pie. The carved turkey breakfast croissant may be the best breakfast sandwich in town. The cafe is cute and they've just added a patio. If you live or work in the area you must give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute shop! Best scone I've ever had, friendly service, quiet atmosphere and easy parking=I will be back! The pies look amazing too!"}
{"text":"Stopped yesterday for the first time what a cute little shop with an awesome owner who I spoke to regarding ordering a carrot cake for Easter so still waiting to try that although I did try the brisket and it was amazing"}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast.  Pumpkin waffle with pumpkin butter and homemade whipped cream.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Very quite place. Great atmosphere and very friendly people. Breakfast and desserts are amazing. Can't wait to try the Pulled pork Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Nice to find some good BBQ in Phoenix.   Way too many yummy looking deserts left to try.  Some creative menu options too."}
{"text":"Full disclosure ... I've only been here once so I'm limited in what I assessed. But this is absolutely a darling of a tiny shop! The decor is whimsical and tasteful and belongs in a lifestyle mag. The staff and owners are just delightful. Bought a whole cherry pie for a party and guests were fighting over the last few pieces. The Snickerdoodle went really fast too. The Mac & Cheese (made with real cheese) I sampled in the shop was good but not great (I may be tough to please here because I have a friend who makes an incomparable Mac & Cheese). I'll be back for that Cherry Pie and Snickerdoodle!"}
{"text":"Awesome, crafted and delicious food with the unexpected combo of pulled pork and home made pies. Fresh and tasty apple slaw! Warm, caring and hard working cooks and owners. Don't be in a rush, because they prepare with care!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for over a year and so glad I did! The nicest people work here and own it, service is fabulous. I had the turkey pesto panini with southern potato salad - both were delicious! My husband had the brisket sandwich, apple slaw and potato salad and was super happy about his meal too. We walked out of there with some scrumptious baked goods - a sea salt Carmel cookie and an oatmeal cream pie - both were delicious! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable. We ended up in there because of the sign guy out on Hayden Road pointing us in there. We went on Super Bowl Sunday and I ended up buying three pies. They were a huge hit. My sons birthday was the following weekend. He asked for an apple pie from Sugar jam instead of a cake. We haven't had breakfast there, although we may be going tomorrow morning. But that smells phenomenal when you're in there. Also, this is a small business with the owners on site working cooking serving the food. So they stand behind their product and they're really nice people."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets 5 stars!  :)  

Very cute & cozy place.  Service was friendly, knowledgeable and patient (1st time there, had to take it all in & decide on just one of the many fine choices).  Very tasty food! 

We got there late, around 1pm (they close @ 2 on Sats) and we had just missed the crowd. There was only one booth of 4 people. 

Although they had run out of the brunch menu, there were other yummy looking choices on the regular menu. 

BF had the Boss Hog & I had the pork & Mac. Yummers!! Very tasty & the green salad that came with was fresh!

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Staff was really awesome. Friendly and greeted you as you entered. Ambiance is awesome, very comfortable. No rush, great coffee, and did I say the staff were awesome?  Gotta check it out."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews and co-workers feedback, I was so excited to try Sugar Jam... and I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, they were not met.

We went on a Wednesday and chose their Italian special of a mozzarella/provolone and tomato grilled cheese sandwich with a cup of \"tomato basil bisque.\" After waiting about 15-20 minutes to get our food, I was expecting the best grilled cheese of all time. It was just okay. I've had similar, but much better grilled cheese sandwiches, at food trucks. And the \"bisque\" seemed more like marinara sauce from a jar. I and my friend used it for dipping our sandwiches, because it was way too strong to eat straight. The sandwich, \"bisque\" and an iced tea (with tip) came out to over $12. Honestly, not worth it (and I'm not someone who cares about the cost if it's good).

I also bought a chocolate cupcake and chocolate chip cookie for the road (over $5 in total). The cupcake was good, but the frosting wasn't as sweet as I like, so if you like Sprinkles frosting, Sugar Jam will not be your thing. The cookie was average as well.

Overall, this was not the experience I was hoping for. Perhaps I had it built up too much? Disappointing nonetheless."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a personal place with delicious thoughtful food...make this a regular. Excellent everyone."}
{"text":"Sugar Jams is a hidden gem in North Scottsdale. Dana and her father treats you as if you are guests in their home. The pulled pork and mojo sauce served with scrambled eggs and a fresh grilled croissant will beckon me back for sure and the organic local roasted coffee comes in giant two hander coffee cups (not mugs) served with fresh cream. Although in the Scottsdale airpark you will be blown away with the bright, perfectly thoughtful, decor Dana has imparted into this industrial space. A great place for breakfast and lunch. Charm galore and fellow ex new yorkers to boot."}
{"text":"I had the turkey panini and my husband the boss hog. We both enjoyed the sandwiches. Sides of potato salad and apple slaw were also good. Pleasant staff. We took home a personal size strawberry rhubarb pie and peanut jam cookie sandwiches. My husband probably would have eaten a whole batch of those cookies if he had the opportunity. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Really don't get all the 5-star reviews. The service is horrific as we sat at the table for 15 minutes before anyone came over. There were only two other customers for lunch so they weren't busy. No excuses. Our server had to look at the menu to write down what we wanted and she literally wrote it down word-for-word on her order pad and asked us to repeat what we wanted. Water glasses sat empty for most of the lunch and then were not filled when wait staff did manage to check on us. Food (bbq Panini) was average at best and could be gotten at Applebee's. Potato salad was bland. Then to top off our dining experience they put our cookies in a wet box which we had to point out to them. 

Good luck but given horrific service and mediocre food this place won't make it a year."}
{"text":"First time here and my husband and I just had a wonderful experience.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful - husband and wife own the place and made sure our meal was perfection, which it was.  
This is our new favorite breakfast/lunch spot.   Can't wait to order all my Christmas pies here."}
{"text":"This place is great! Really tasty brunch food and awesome customer service. I ate here with my family and 101-year-old grandmother and the owners couldn't have been more welcoming. I haven't stopped dreaming of their biscuits and homemade jam. Very jealous of those that live in Arizona and get to come here on the regular!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday and enjoyed the baked goodies. Back again today to get more yumminess and try the BBQ. Who knew there would be such an amazing place that gets baking and bbq just right? On top of that, Dana and Leon make every visit that much better and it feels like going over to a friend's place for the best time. I'm going to miss this when I go back to Cali! Come here and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"A local gem!  If you are in the Scottsdale Airpark area, stop into this little gem for a treat or for lunch.  We ran for a sampling of cookies, tartlets & brownies today at work and were all very pleased with the quality of baked goods.  They just revamped their menu so next time, we're all going to have lunch there. The brisket sounds fabulous.  All from scratch, made right there.     The panini's will be the next thing I try.... oh, and the cherry pie!!!"}
{"text":"I had what was easily one of the best eating out experiences of my life the other day. It was pi day, so I was there for the obvious reason, but understanding there was BBQ to be had, I made it a whole lunch thing. Now, it's not a \"BBQ joint\", so don't think my expectations were too high, but the chopped hickory smoked brisket and apple slaw sandwich was exceptionally good, and certainly puts Sugar Jam high up on the list when that particular craving hits.

Being pi day, the pie supply halfway through the day was ebbing, so I got my request in for a fresh cherry pie, and it went in the oven while I had my sandwich and an excellent bottled root beer (Brownie Caramel Cream, which I am further indebted to Sugar Jam for the introduction). With the exception of people who don't like cherries (I'm not mad at you, but I don't understand you, and we probably can't be friends) I cannot imagine a person on earth who wouldn't consider committing a felony to experience that level of pleasure and satisfaction. The fact that you don't have to is testament to the service the Sugar Jam bake shop provides to humanity, which I am looking forward to supporting as much as possible on future visits."}
{"text":"So Yummy! This is my favorite bakery in Scottsdale/Phoenix. I always come in and get the peach cobbler and lemon raspberry cookies. But now I am hooked on Cherry Pie. Can I say Dana the Owner makes the BEST CHERRY pie in town. She is super sweet! Nice to have recognition when you come into a shop. The crust is light and flaky with a touch of sweetness. I could eat the crust all day! Not too mention I had a great lunch today at her shop. Bbq applewood smoked pulled pork on a panini brioche bun with slaw and potato salad on the side. The BBq sauce is Awesome! Ok I am Superful!   But tonight is my cherry pie night! Can't wait.....Cookies I will have tomorrow. I will be ordering a pie and cake for Thanksgiving too. 
This place is the true meaning of small business. I will be coming back weekly!"}
{"text":"Excellent family owned bakery and cafe.  Went for lunch and had BBQ salads and brisket sandwiches. All excellent.   Took home baked goods (bread pudding and cookies ) which were very good as well.  Owner is very nice.  Must stop and have breakfast or lunch here."}
{"text":"Very nice owners, amazing pies and cookies and the food is great! Lemon shortbread cookies melt in your mouth and the apple and cherry pies are to die for!"}
{"text":"The food here is not good, it's excellent! Off the beaten path but very much worth finding. If you like sweets or want a great lunch or breakfast add this spot to your must visit locations."}
{"text":"Someone brought me to this gem today...everything about it is just perfect. Staff was great, atmosphere was fun and quirky and the food was amazing
 Try the pull pork msc n cheese
 Wow. Can't wait to try the rest f the menu. Think I found my new work lunch spot"}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden local establishment with superb very friendly service and awesome food.   This is a must stop in Scottsdale.  Don't under any circumstances skip dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. It's clean and cute; everything is made fresh and day of. I got the beef brisket sandwich and it was delicious! Tried some of the cookies and apple pie and they were amazing! The staff is super friendly and helpful and gave us great recommendations. Will definitely be back when I come to Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"Found this place because of rave reviews of the pies. We ordered a brisket sandwich, a pulled pork sandwich and the pulled pork macaroni and cheese. Everything was delicious. The shop is small but charming. SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT- friendly, attentive. We were stuffed so we didn't grab a pie but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the kind hearts of Dana and the staff at Sugar Jam, I would've been without a wedding cake for my special day. After getting the run around from another bakery, my fianc√© spent his entire day calling bakeries trying to see if someone would be able to help us out since we were put in a such a bind; our wedding was less than 2 weeks away. 

After he called Sugar Jam, Dana didn't hesitate to step in and help us, and I couldn't be more appreciative or thankful. She made the process so easy, and was open to having us send her pictures of what kind of cake we were imagining, as well as customize each tier with different flavors and buttercream. I was going to pick up the cake myself on the day of the wedding so I could tell everyone in person how appreciative I was, but I got caught up at the salon and had to send my two bridesmaids. They sent me a snapshot of the cake and I was floored, it was beautiful!!! I couldn't have imagined it turning out any better, and I received compliments all night about how great the cake looked. But once we got past the looks and it came time for eating, we were just as thrilled. The cake was delicious and it was absolutely everything we asked for. 

So Dana, thank you and your staff so much for having giant hearts and fitting in our wedding cake when it was starting to look hopeless for us. The stress of it all was so worth it because it led us to you, and I can't wait to continue using your bake shop in the future, and will refer anyone and everyone I know. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"What a great spot. The food was wonderful and the sauce is unique and tasty. Great coffee too. Locally owned by a husband and wife team. They are very nice and create a pleasant atmosphere for brunch. Try the big bacon and egg croissant with all of the peppers and onions. I'm going to get a pie before I go, no doubt one of my new breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Another amazing brunch with the fantastic crew at SugarJam this morning!  The savory scones are absolutely amazing.  And I most definitely didn't leave without grabbing a sweet treat for later!!   I'm so happy I get to eat wonderful food in a friendly, happy location."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying, we were staying in Scottsdale for a few days and used yelp to find good places to eat while we were in town. 

We eat out a lot. Like too much. However, this place as small and quaint as it may seem served us one of the best meals we have ever had. The pulled pork hash seemed a little odd, however we rolled the dice and gave it a try. We were amazed by the balance of sweetness, vs everything else on the plate. Honestly, this dish was amazing. Not to mention the home made fresh croissant and home made Apple butter. The portions were huge, but honestly you can't push the plate away. Not to mention, while you're trying to enjoy your meal, your sitting next to a display cooler full of some amazing looking pies and cupcakes. The couple who run the place are very sweet and personable. 

In closing I want to point out, that upon leaving Scottsdale, we booked outlet flight around being able to go here again before we left."}
{"text":"Service was great! They have call ahead seating too. Food was delicious. I had French toast and bacon. Husband had the savory scones with bbq pork. Yummy all the way round.  No dessert, although it looked delish, too full!"}
{"text":"Delicious, the brisket and biscuits was very flavorful, add a little bbq per bite.
The kitchen sink cookie was very yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered a cake for a special occasion. The staff and owner were very helpful and friendly. The cake both tasted and looked excellent.  Very happy with the whole experience"}
{"text":"Brisket and a brownie and that was my experience at Sugar Jam. This smallish place is a bit tough to find, but worth the extra U-turn or two you might need to get here. My chopped brisket sandwich was knocked out of the park and each of those two BBQ sauces on the table have their own charm. The vinegary one though might be better to dip the sandwich into rather than squirt it on. Either way, the meat and both side dishes were a winner. The apple slaw had visible apple slices and something about that potato salad made it extra tasty after a brisket bite. Also was given a sample of Cowboy beans and wow those were quite next level as well. I had to select a baked good and ended up with a terrific triple chocolate brownie to go laced with icing on top. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Luckily, the wait at two other breakfast spots allowed us to stumble upon Sugar Jam! I had the Parisian French toast...best French toast I've had in Phoenix! My boyfriend got the Smoked brisket and biscuits and he loved it, as well as their home made \"Mojo Thunder Sauce\" and home made BBQ sauce. Can't wait wait to come back and try more! Bought an apple pie for later!"}
{"text":"I discovered Sugar Jam at The Food Truck Caravan Event on Valentine's Day in 2015.
I have been addicted to this place every since.  Why you ask?  Oh let me tell you... 

EVERYTHING they make is made with love.  Love a mother has for her baby, love a kid has for the favorite blankie, love a man has for J-Lo's behind.  You know, pure LOVE!

I have had all of their pies, and the flavors are always on point.  I hate cherry pie, but Dana's is so good and the spices she uses compliment the cherry filling.  The crust is homemade and flaky.  I always get the mini pies that \"should\" be eaten in 2 servings.  I end up eating the whole thing every time and refuse to feel bad about it!  

Her brownies should be called legal crack because they taste like actual chocolate!  Who has had horrible brown cake that was mislabeled as brownies before? *raises hand in shame*  The brownies are Sugar Jam are moist, nicely proportioned (should be eaten in more than one serving, but I never do), and delectable.  Goodness gracious they are so luscious.  My favorite is the caramel toffee explosion.  It's not too much of one ingredient, it is a nice balance that spreads across your taste buds and sends you to a euphoric place of chocolatey goodness.  If you find yourself needing to eat one in a dark room so no one can see or here you, go right ahead!  You can never go wrong with the classic brownie.  But when she is in a creative mood and makes a specialty flavor, get it!  She is very thoughtful of the ingredients she puts together.  You can tell from the first taste to the life shattering last bite or lick of the container.  

Gosh I could go on and on because the cookies, cakes, scones (omg her scones... mmm...), muffins, sugar jamming cookies (another legal form of crack) are all amazing!  I haven't had her savory items but my husband has.  His eyes rolled till only the whites were showing.  So yeah... The savory items are great too! 

They use fresh ingredients and take time to make things right everyday.  You aren't going to get inconsistent food from here. Dana and her staff truly love cooking and respect it as the art it is."}
{"text":"New business. Reccommended by staff at Ace Hardware (Dad watching over his girl)

Monday lunch for two. Sandwiches w/ baked beans, on the side. Pecan wood smoked chicken for her, Boss Hog (pulled pork & brisket) for me. Both sammies topped with slaw. OUTSTANDING.

Each sandwich had distinct flavor. Not one of those BBQ joints where everything tastes the same.

Meats we tender and juicy.

Dessert - Fresh baked pie, shared cherry and apple. Both were something special. Not the same old recipe. Creative.

Staff were very warm & friendly. Cute down home decor.

Nothing fancy, just very solid food from nice folks."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here.  Best pulled pork sandwich and baked beans I've ever had.  So good."}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday Brunch and my service and the food was wonderful. Such a great staff that really make you feel at home. 
Thanks Sugar Jam for making our Sunday Brunch so memorable."}
{"text":"The first few times I ordered takeout from Sugar Jam the food was delicious and the services always top notch.  However, my last two purchases were absolutely mediocre.  A few weeks ago I ordered the grill cheese panini takeout.  I asked for only one type of cheese.  As per the description and price I was expecting a gourmet panini; what I got, was a greasy mess with nothing but bread, cheese and butter or lard (who knows).  It was so disgusting, I threw it out.   Earlier this week I gave them another go and ordered a couple of scones for breakfast; what I got was two tiny, soggy, greasy things that did not resembled a scone.  It is so disappointing but I will skip this place in the future.  2 stars because the staff is incredibly nice."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. Amazing food, fantastic service and great vibe. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Very highly recommend - you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Best bacon in town.  It was thick, cooked just right,  and smoked for flavor. Breakfast was absolutely delicious.  Lots of flavor in everything.  Great sweets too with added extra flavors.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We waited for an hour for our food to come out and it never did. My kids were starving. 2 other tables came in after us and received their food. We went up front  and paid for our coffee, orange juice, and 2 pastries. $20 later and we didn't even get our breakfast. Their excuse was they were making holiday orders for pies... still doesn't explain why everyone else got their food before us."}
{"text":"I work a hop, skip and a jump away from this sweet little shop so my boss and I eat here 3 days a week or more. The Paninis are beyond delicious, Wednesday's tomato bisque and grilled cheese Panini has become my weekly must have. I ordered the herb roasted turkey yesterday and I was blown away. The service is fast and always friendly, everyone smiles! I have not tasted many desserts but what I have tried I was not disappointed. The cupcakes are decorated beautifully and so tender and moist and the lemon zest tartlet was to die for!"}
{"text":"There's a reason all the elite (foodies) have been here. It's amazing and incredibly delicious. The only question I have is why did we wait so long to try this place. My husband and I both had the SJ breakfast (applewood smoked pulled pork hash saut√©ed with peppers, onions & potatoes) served with perfectly scrambled eggs and the best croissant on the planet. All their jams and sauces are homemade and perfect. We are set for the next 18 hours with the full bellies we have."}
{"text":"We were in the vicinity looking at remodeling supplies and desperately needed nourishment.  What a wonderful surprise.  Really fresh food, amazing pulled pork, a pannini made to order and slaw that was incredibly fresh.  I resisted the baked goods, but my honey said his was amazing  a genuine find.  The decor is bakery quaint.  Given the fleur de lys and the menu, someone hearkens from the South.  And, of course, the team was very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Hi to all, wife and I have discovered this Bistro a couple of months ago. Their weekend breakfast are great, only have full menu on Sat and Sun.
Their Pie's are great we had apple and the best pecan we have ever had! Be sure and give them a try. Truly a mom and pop also grandpa and grandma. :)"}
{"text":"This was our first visit, but definitely not our last! Would give more than 5 stars if I could. Love finding good homemade food. I have been searching forever for biscuits & gravy like my mom used to make and the ones served here are as close as you could get! I requested more gravy than what was initially provided (as suggested by the couple seated behind us) and it was served at no extra cost. 

They said they started as a food truck and then moved into having a restaurant. It's small, but clean, bright, cheery and clean. Hard to find, but worth the hunt. 

*It should be noted that they close at 1:30 on Sundays. Not sure why they made that decision as it's a little hard to get there in time  from where we live in north Phoenix following church service.  They close at 3:00 on other days. Closed all day Monday. 

The cook is the wife of the couple that own and run  it and the husband is the friendly dude that takes the orders and does everything else. He said she's \"Sugar\" and he's \"Jam\". How cute is that?!!

We will be returning and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is not only cute, but the sweets (that is the only stuff I've had so far) are amazing.   During the holidays I ordered a bourbon pecan pie.  It was out of this world.  I love pecan pie, it is my favorite, so I if I am going to have all those calories, it better be good.  This one was AMAZING, I love the crust, so flaky and crunchy and the same time and the creaminess and sweet gooeyness of the filling, so decadent.  The second time, my husband go several holiday cookies and scones, I loved the salted caramel scone.  We also got a blueberry one and a raspberry.  The other day I got some more cookies, I couldn't get enough of the sandwich cookie, that has a cutout on the top one.  I had a peach cobbler one and and amaretto.  I think they are called jammies.  This was the second time I have ordered them, they are like a sugar cookie that is crunchy and firm with a filling.  Soooo good."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese with BBQ was tasty, the side salad fresh and with a excellent variety vegetables.   My husband had to return his brisket/pork sandwich because the meat was too sweet.  The finishing sauce is mostly sugar.  Five stars because they were kind enough to sub the sweet sandwich for a basic grilled cheese.  Make sure you like very sweet pulled pork or brisket before ordering these sandwiches.  Decor was lovely but hated the use of paper plates.  The fork pushes through the styrofoam."}
{"text":"This spot makes some of the best barbecue sandwiches/paninis. Their pies look amazing and I have heard they're as delicious as they look...like you may not make it home with a whole pie intact good. 
I wish I was able to get in there in the morning to try their breakfast food. Maybe someday they'll switch to all day breakfast! :D
Don't miss the SugarJam Bake Shop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We ordered the French toast which was excellent. Bacon perfectly done and favorable. I asked for a sample of gravy to try and they were accommodating and it was FABULOUS. The best gravy I have ever had in a restaurant. It was even slightly better than my grandma's which was the best in the world.  This is home cooking at it finest.  The owner is also from NC like I am.  I can't wait to return for an encore."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. This is a family owned cafe and treats you like family. The baked goods are homemade and to die for. The food is phenomenal especially the smoked pulled pork with their own creation sauces. I feel so lucky that I found this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic and Fabulous!!!! I had never been before and am so happy to find this gem!!! We ordered cupcakes which were so good. I can't wait to go for brunch, breakfast or lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I found Sugar Jam in Yelp, and the experience has convinced me that these are both excellent resources. I have driven by the bakery several times and somehow did not notice. It is fabulous. Very nice lady owns, bakes, and serves you. Her husband came from behind the counter just to introduce himself and thank me for coming in. Extraordinary people. The food and treats are wonderful. Cakes, pies, scones, cupcakes, cookies, and lunch items daily. I tried a cupcake and mini cherry pie. Both homemade, fresh and terrific. I was so pleased that I called them a day or so later and ordered a whole pie. One that wasn't on their menu but she made it for me anyway. Wow was it good and price was fair. . They do lots of catering from the understanding that I had. I have lived in AZ since 1963 and have wanted to find a good old fashion bakery, that is fresh and delicious. Thank you Yelp for helping me find Sugar Jam. Near Scottsdale Airpark. Worth the time to try it. They close mid afternoon, so go in morning or for lunch. You will want to write a review also."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the spur of the moment after going to the tile store across the way and I am so glad we did. It was wonderful!!! It's a small place with a cute shabby chic decor and wonderfully friendly staff. 

We came for brunch and had the Belgium waffle with ham and eggs and the Parisian French toast with bacon and eggs. While we were waiting for our food they brought out these cute little muffin poppers. The food took a while to come out but I think it was more due to the timing of our arrival before a large party than it being the norm as food started out coming out much quicker the longer were there. Brunch was delicious and the servings were huge. I could only finish half the waffle. The bacon that came with my husbands French toast was amazing and I would go back just for that but we are also anxious to go back for the BBQ. While waiting for our check we sampled their homemade BBQ sauce that was on the table and it was fantastic (if you are a lover of sweet sauces). We ended up buying a jar to take home. We also took a look at some of the tasty looking baked goods on our way out. They have an assortment of cookies, cup cakes, mini pies, scones, and bread pudding. It all looked wonderful but we grabbed a cream filled chocolate sandwich cookie to bring home for our son. I've already sampled a bite of this huge cookie and it is wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Cookies were good, had cherry cheese danishes and almond claws all were great.  Disappointed that they needed 48 hours instead of 24 hours to make a small birthday cake.  We are from out of town so didn't know that's how it works here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small and cute but the menu is limited and the prices are very high. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich because I needed lunch and only had a short break. It was $11."}
{"text":"Very cute place that has outstanding food. Bakery department looks amazing. The service was good in the owners were very friendly. It's a little out-of-the-way. But would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The best sourdough grilled cheese sandwich. Fresh salads. Very cute and here are homemade baked goods. They have a tea bar with a good selection of teas. Only a couple of vegetarian options. Love this cute little place."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. My husband and I were looking for lunch after being at a nearby business. Thanks to the five-star rating on Yelp, we found this gem.

Lucas (at front counter), Brian (server and husband of owner), and Leon (chef and father of owner) each came to talk to us and couldn't have been nicer and more generous. Service is absolutely exceptional.

For food, the turkey, egg, and cheese croissant with tomatoes was hearty, buttery, and delicious. My husband could not stop raving about the pulled pork sandwich. Get the mojo sauce if you like a sweet kick. I could drink the stuff. Their coffee with their chocolate cupcake with buttercream - holy cow. 

They said they were expanding the place. Good for them. They deserve it. Can't wait to bring the whole family in."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. Yet, such delicious barbecue should not be a secret. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I am looking for a bakery to bake my dad's 70th birthday cake. I stopped in and met Dana... she is pretty great!! She has been a baker for quite some time. I left with the cake menu and an individual pecan pie. OH MY!!! It is THE best pecan pie I have ever had!!! I will return here!! Dana will be making my dads cake!!!"}
{"text":"Happens to find this place by accident while going to a nearby office , I should say this is the best Account I've ever been to, Fine, Amazing and Healthy food, The Owner Diana are are worm welcome person, I felt like in my Mother kitchen, I highly recommend you to go and try the place, I promise you, you won't be disappointed,"}
{"text":"We went to this cute bakery this morning for breakfast.  First of all it was so adorable.  It was nicely decorated and extremely clean.  The baked goods were so AMAZING!!!  We each had a scone and each scone was served with lemon curd. It was so yummy.  We even bought muffins to go.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok folks! Let's start with the hospitality! Friendly wait staff genuine smile with excellent service. Met the owners who were very friendly and very engaging about sharing information about SJBS and the wonderful menu items. The place is very clean and has a homely feel about it.

The food is off the chain!!!! And get's a yesssss mister!!!! I had the biscuits and gravy meal with bbq brisket with a side of eggs, potatoes, and a waffle. Yes team, as I write this post 4hrs later, I am still full from breakfast .The waffle is something special. My son had toast this is in the same category as the waffle dayum! SJBS is going to be one of those restaurants in the near future where it will hard to get into. Sugar Jam is well worth the hr. drive from the SE valley to eat a great breakfast. The shrimp and grits is a specialty item.....Dana! You need to add the shrimp and grits to the rotation AWESOME! Be sure to hit the bakery up while you there as well, we picked up a small pecan pie treat for good measure. 

The right price, the right place, and the right atmosphere. 

Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Tucked back in a corporate office complex is a little gem. The relaxed atmosphere is perfect for a slow Saturday brunch. The coffee was delicious. The French toast and biscuits and gravy were also delicious."}
{"text":"What an awesome little place! The owner (I wish I could remember his name) is amazing. We chatted for quite a while about his business, history, etc. I only had coffee and a chocolate chip cookie, but they were as good as it gets. Finally, he gave me a sample of some pork and oh son! I'll definitely be back, and I live all the way in Queen Creek! If you're in the area, (Hayden and Redfield in Scottsdale), you have to stop by."}
{"text":"We ordered the apple, pear, cranberry walnut pie for my dad's birthday and it was absolutely amazing.  The crust is light and  compliments all the fruit filling which is the perfect amount of sweetness and best part was after eating it you feel just right.  I will definitely be ordering another one once peach season starts.  My husband said they were making banana cream pies when he was in there picking up our order, that's a favorite in my house so we will be back shortly for one of those too!! Thanks Sugar Jam we are so happy we found a place with good quality pies!!!"}
{"text":"I was out in Arizona on vacation, and was advised by a friend to stop by!!!! And boy was I happy I did!!!!!! Best selection I've ever seen! Their customer service goes above and beyond. I definitely recommend this place to anyone that goes out there."}
{"text":"Yum. Veggie omelet was delightful and my husband's brisket and biscuits ... omg! It was super yummy! The owners came out and spoke to the tables around our area and were super kind! He said- \"She's sugar and I'm jam\" lol
They are doing a great job.
The rest of the staff was great as well! 
We will be back- probably next weekend!"}
{"text":"So cute and such good food!  The owners gave us a free sample of cherry pie and checked on how we were doing.  There was no wait, and it was great!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped by here for lunch after driving by this little shop for months. I got a hot turkey panini and was surprised to be served a beautiful sandwich with thick slices, REAL turkey, Delicious bacon, melty cheese and tomato all on toasty, herbed bread. So good! 

Then..terror ensued (not really). My boyfriend got the special, which was a turkey club, of sorts, on sour dough with pepper jack cheese. After the first bite, he knew immediately: the pepper jack cheese was spoiled. It took me one whiff to confirm! So much for his lunch. :(

Otherwise, The food was delicious and the servings were big. The cheese was one thing, and even though I think that's something that should have been caught, it may have been easy to miss during a lunch rush. We would still go back and try again."}
{"text":"We just finished sampling some of the great cookies and other baked goods at SugarJams. What an amazing local bakery. They also have lunch items which we did not sample this time, but will next time we are in which will be soon. My wife and I LOVED the caramel cookie. This was our very favorite. I also liked the peach, almond and other jam cookies. Really nice deep taste to the cookie and the jam just sent it over the top. I also tried the pumpkin muffin which I liked, again a nice deep pumpkin flavor. I also bought a cherry scone which had a most wonderful tart/sweet cherries in them. I really loved this one also. They have Lemon curd and honey buttery to go with any of these items and they were soooooo good, so don't forget to get these to go with your scones and muffins.

They will be adding award winning BBQ to their menu in early october which should be amazing. I can't wait. :)

Finally anyone who misses Pie in the Sky on thompson peak should RUN to SugarJam's for their PIES! I will be ordering my holiday pies from SJs very soon!."}
{"text":"My first experience here was last Father's Day.  I didn't get a chance to eat as I walked out after waiting 55 minutes for my food.  I had my 2 kids with me and they couldn't wait any longer.  Today I gave it a second chance.  Because of my last experience I did set a timer. This time it only took 50 minutes to get my food.  The food was good...but not 50 minutes wait good.  The wait staff was very pleasant, but this establishment really needs someone to come in and help them.  I understand it's a small family owned operation, but excuses aside, they need to get it together."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The staff was friendly, but soooooooo slow. We waited 50 minutes for our food to come out and here's what I don't get: we ordered the brisket with biscuits and gravy and the bbq pork. Both come with scrambled eggs which are the only thing that had to be cooked real-time, right? Why did it take forever? We watched tabes of 4+ get their plates one at a time...sometimes 10 minutes between plates. The food was good - their sausage gravy was outstanding. When we asked for the check, we went up to the cashier who couldn't figure out what we ordered. Lol It could be a great spot if the kitchen and operations have drastic improvements."}
{"text":"This place is literally too amazing to describe in this tiny box.   Just go there!!!   The setting is beyond adorable and comfortable,  the service is well above standard and the food.   THE FOOD!!!!   oh my gosh.   So delicious.   Quality ingredients and knowledgeable staff I had their pulled pork sandwich cause I'm a suckered for a good southern pulled pork and this was definitely one of the best in my life.   I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The bake shop truck was at the art festival, Score! Best apple pie and crust I've had. Even better than my own. For a steep price of $6 you can get a personal size pie that actually feeds 2 quite generously so actually it's more like a $3 slice if you split it with a friend. 

Warmed up with ice cream this would have been euphoric!"}
{"text":"Get in here! Sweet Southern BBQ and bakery. Everything is made from scratch. So many great things to try. Started with scratch sticky buns and salted caramel scones made this morning. 

Can't wait to continue to support local, non-chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"I discovered this gem almost by accident. I would drive by 3 days a week and see the sign spinner. My son one Saturday found it on yelp and we went there. We've been regulars ever since. The food is indescribably delicious whether you are there for breakfast or lunch. The wait staff and owners are attentive and friendly. The coffee is outstanding. Their waffle would float away if you flipped it in the air! The baked goods are obscenely delicious and creative. Don't miss this gem of an eatery!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in all of Scottsdale!!!!

We had the Parisian Style French Toast plus the Smoke Brisket & Biscuit.  Both are amazingly flavorful dishes that we highly recommend.  You can taste the high quality ingredients and the care that were put into making each of these items.  The gravy was tasty and the biscuits were light and fluffy.  Combined with the smoke brisket the taste was excellent.  The French Toast also was just top shelf. Just a little maple syrup was all you needed as the goodness could be tasted into each bite. 

We can't wait for our next visit and to try more of the menu.  Also, the baked goods look great."}
{"text":"What a great find. This is a little hidden gem in North Scottsdale. We tried multiple desserts and none disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG! The raspberry lemon jam is super delicious and refreshing!!!! We also tasted the cherry cheesecake muffin.... yes! Great food. Super adorable cafe."}
{"text":"The food is well portioned the BBQ sandwiches were excellent
Liked that they had some special sodas ( black cherry and ginger ale)
Reminds me of a small sweet shop
Friendly service feels like a great family restaurant"}
{"text":"The Boss Hog sandwich was delicious! Just the right amount of pulled pork, beef brisket, barbecue sauce and cole slaw. The sandwich was very filling and affordable for barbecue. The salted carmel cookie topped off the meal.  The corn on the cob was just ok, I'll try a different side next time."}
{"text":"The food is the best! I enjoyed the French toast and the brisket and biscuit meal. Sooo many options to chose from. The coffee is the best I have ever had. Great service, friendly servers and cool music."}
{"text":"Looking for the perfect place to meet your friend for lunch or take your mom for a Mother's Day brunch or a cozy weekend date? Or maybe you just want to treat yourself to some 'me' time, complete with a delicious fresh baked goodie you've been craving for months but haven't been able to find. Well look no further than this little gem in the middle of a business park. Very few places in Phoenix have high-quality baked goods as this place their pies are an absolute must taste like grandma makes! But beyond their baked goods is an awesome menu filled with great salads sandwiches and even homemade bbq items, it's really a unique cool little place and it feels like you're inside of a French bistro it's decorated so cute! I wasn't even expecting it but as an added bonus they had homemade iced tea and made me a fresh Arnold Palmer!"}
{"text":"What a darling little spot! Trying to break from our brunch rut we found this cute place! Hidden away in a business building so you have to be on the lookout! The interior is charming, decorated like a little Parisian Cafe! You order at the counter and then seat yourself. We had several goodies to choose from for Saturday's Menu. I had the French Toast with pecan syrup! It was wonderful served with eggs that were prepared perfectly and bacon! My fianc√© had the Brisket & Biscuits and I had to sneak a bite it looked so good! The flavor was amazing! A great smoke flavor with a fabulous rub on the meat! We also had a nice visit with Leon the father of the Owner! He was super kind and obviously very proud of what they do at their Cafe! It was nice Very to hear the history and the pride of this dad talking about his daughter 
We will be back to enjoy another breakfast and I have to get one of those Cherry Pies!!"}
{"text":"Great place with outstanding service!  Homemade jam is wonderful!  Please please start to sell it. 

Joanie is great!  Really professional waitress like old times. 

Owners were really great & flexible allowing us to create off-menu omelette. 

Super happy! Go here!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We ordered the brisket and biscuits and the Belgian waffle. The biscuits were light and moist, the gravy rich and smoky. Such great flavor.  But the waffle. Oh the waffle. Heaven. I don't typically order waffles but since this was customer favorite I decided to go for it. I am not disappointed. The waffle was fall flavored and came with flavored butter and whipped cream. This was our first visit and we are already planning our next. My compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"Really good - I went here once after it first opened and wasn't sold, I think she was still trying to iron out the kinks.  However, I went back today and am glad I did!  Everything seemed much more organized, she has expanded, and the menu was more appealing. My only suggestion would be to add fruit salad or some kind of fruit as a side option.  I ordered the mac and cheese and it was spectacular, but I was underwhelmed by the side choices.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were surprised by the location (its in a business park), but we were so happy we ate there. The food was so, so good and the entire staff was so genuinely NICE! We'll definitely go back and recommend others as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed,
After being tired of my regular breakfast restaurants,, I thought I try the Sugar jam Bake Shop,,
I ordered all American breakfast, I couldn't figure out why wrapped the eggs in tinfoil, then wrap the bacon in tinfoil, and the toast in tinfoil

I suggest they get some tips from Wildflower, On how to package a to go breakfast


So almost $11 for a small amount of eggs potatoes and two pieces of bacon, I'm now happy to go back to my regular routine , not to mention they open at 8:30 AM, the rest of the business Airpark is vibrant at 7 AM,

Charming interior, but did not live up to my expectations"}
{"text":"Cute little gem located in Scottsdale!! Thoroughly enjoyed a visit to Sugar Jam this morning with a couple girlfriends!! The atmosphere, food and service was amazing!! Can't wait to come back and try either the waffles or French toast that they make from scratch!! Highly recommend and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love the cookies and the service is great. I have not had the opportunity to try the other tasty treats but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and lunch.  Very friendly service.  Hidden gem.  Highly recommend to anyone who likes a good bistro or BBQ."}
{"text":"Had the veggie omelette. Just outstanding. Flavors I never tasted before and I still could not finish the entire meal. Coffee price a bit steep but over all the meal was a good value."}
{"text":"First time visit the breakfast was delicious and very fresh, the BBQ pork was very tender with excellent flavor. Service was fast and friendly, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted to get out of the office in the afternoon and grab a snack. I headed to SugarJam Bake shop, which is right down the street. The gentleman working the counter was very helpful. He told me all about the different cookies and baked goods they have to offer. He even gave me the run down on the savory foods they offer.

I chose two jam-filled cookies(lemon raspberry and almond amaretto), which is how they got their start, and a caramel toffee cookie. All three were good, but not necessarily exceptional or unique. The jam cookies were a little on the hard side.

The cookies were good, however I was in sticker shock when I went to pay. $7.29 for three cookies? Sorry, I can't justify paying that much for cookies."}
{"text":"Our company just moved into business park in the area.
We decided to give this place a try. we were not disappointed.
The first two times I went I had the applewood smoked pulled pork sandwich and it is delicious! 
Today I had the herb turkey panini, that too was delicious. 
I have never had southern apple slaw till I found this place. It is go good.

And their personal cherry pies, are scrumptious.
I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local bakeries and barbeque spots in the entire valley!! I recently stopped by and the owner, dana, treated my frends and I like family. I ordered the BBQ sliders and they were TO DIE FOR!! The pulled pork and chopped brisket are by,far the best I have ever had!! My friend got a side of the potato salad with her sliders and after tasting them I nearly are the rest off of her plate!!! I had the cowboy beans with my meal and they tasted absolutely AMAZING. By the end we were stuffed but we just had to take home one of the cute personal cherry pies and later that night we devoured it! I do not,think,i have ever tasted a cherry pie like this, it was absolutely breathtaking! I am already planning on getting pies here for the holiday season! Overall the food was outstanding,sweets were to die for, the service was excellent and the decor was super cute! I will DEFINITELY be back again and share this adorable hidden treasure with everyone. If you are looking for an all around great experience this is the number one place to,go!!!"}
{"text":"I happened to see a sign spinner this week and began a plan to take my beautiful wife to breakfast during the weekend.

Super Cute place, friendly staff, and great baked goods.... but the star of this visit was the Belgian waffle and ham breakfast.A crisp waffle served with whipped honey butter and warm maple syrup was expected, but the bourbon glazed ham was out of this world.

We took some cookies and a scone to go and they were also great.

I am almost afraid to post this, as I don't want too many people to find this gem in the airpark."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the back side of a very industrial area, SugarJam is such a hidden gem! Cute decor, a nice little patio area, and a wonderful variety of baked goodies make this place worth finding and visiting. But go early, as the pies sell out amazingly fast.
We savored the Mac n Cheese with Pulled Pork and coleslaw. Both were really yummy! Wanted pie for dessert, but they were sold out. Opted for cookies instead. To.die.for. The sandwich cookies were perfectly baked and packed with interesting flavors. Kind of glad the pie was sold out.
The only hiccup in the whole experience was that the wait time seemed a bit long (about 40 minutes). It would have been nice for the waitstaff to have kept us updated on the progress of our food, but the server disappeared after taking our order and didn't reappear until our food arrived. This was our first time visiting, so perhaps this was unusual. Still, regular check-ins would have been nice.
But DO NOT let this in any way stop you from giving them a try. You will be SO GLAD you did.
***Update*** Gave my feedback to the management, who responded right away.  He let me know that they were down a waitperson and a chef that day, hence the long wait and lack of information. We will definitely be going back to SugarJam to eat their baked deliciousness and update our report on the service issues."}
{"text":"Holy moly, best tasting cake I've ever had!!! Dana was very sweet and willing to help me in a pinch. Ordered a chocolate and Oreo cake for my daughter's 5th birthday and wasn't expecting it to be so heavenly. I'm not an icing kind of girl but the actual cake part was out of this world!! Incredibly moist, rich and ultra satisfying. Everyone loved it so much I had to hide a piece just so I could get a bite!!"}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to try here? This place was on my bookmark for a long time and finally I came here for lunch the other day.

Really love that cute decor inside. Nice cafe with warm design. 

I started my lunch with the boss hog as I couldn't decided between pulled pork and brisket. I wanted have both! BBQ sauce was so good, I didn't know until later but they sell this BBQ sauce here. I have to make sure to remember to buy one next time. I really liked that green Apple inside, added unique texture to the meal, enjoyed every bite. For the side, I had Mac and cheese. Homemade and very tasty, nicely complimented the BBQ. They had other side dishes and all sounded good. I guess I need to come back here soon.

Since I really liked the bread served with sandwich, I had to try their baked dessert. Bread for sandwich had slight sweetness to it, I bed their cake will taste good too.  So for my dessert, I tried their apple pie. Just came out of the oven! One of the best apple pie I ever had. It wasn't overly sweet, just right amount of sweetness to it, I had to ask the staff about it. She said they use brown sugar. 

Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air. First and foremost the pies rock it. Better than you momma made. They know how to do it right. The owners are just so sweet and accommodating. The shop is cute and inviting.  So if you want the best pie in town.  This is the place"}
{"text":"Amazing menu for Sunday Brunch - such a cute patio early in morning. We tried the French Toast and Scones/Pulled Pork. Everything made with care and love. We had their cupcakes and brownies at a huge party Friday night so had to get some Salted Carmel Choc chip cookies to go! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place and have always thought about trying it because the name and location looks cute and cozy, I finally stopped in for breakfast this morning with my wife and we both loved it, it's pretty small inside but they also have a nice outdoor patio. My wife got the French Toast and I had eggs and toast with their signature Sugar Jam! Everything was delicious and the service was great  also a very nice selection of fresh pastries"}
{"text":"Can i give this place 10 stars? My husband just surprised me, for my birthday, with TWO amazing cakes! I got to over indulge in the most decadent red velvet cake, and my all-time-favorite salted caramel cake. I need to try more. Everything I try is better than the last. Thank you sugar jam for making my bday so deliciously special! This is one to remember."}
{"text":"Everyone knows breakfast and brunch is my thing.... so when I had another opportunity to visit this Sugar Jam. I was on it! 

As you walk in this place its so adorable. It takes you back to a side street cafe in Italy.  There signature colors are yellow and black which makes the decor pleasing to the eyes. 

 We were seated quickly and a sweet lady with a patriotic shirt and hair bow greeted us at the table. Her smile was genuine and warm. She handed us the menu and rattled off the special.  

The menu was straight and to the point, nothing bulky and repetitive.  

A buttoned up chief's coat gentleman greeted us and asked us what we would like to order.  Starving,  I ordered the veggie omelet and my hubby ordered the all american with apple chicken sausage.

I'm ready to eat...... the brunch came out in less than 10 mins. Perfect for me because my stomach starting  talking to growling.

The omelet looked amazing now let's try it.

...WOWwwww! 

My hubby leaned over to me and said \"taste that\" he placed an apple chicken ausage on my plate.  Fork to mouth and it happened...WTF GOODNESS! 

The omelet was perfection... Listen it is very difficult to make a good omelet but to make a perfect omelet with the right amount of cheese, peppers and onions.  That's a genius.  

The apple chicken sausage was so moist I didn't realized I finished it.  The amount of food that you receive can keep you full all day long.  

The raspberry jam was off the chain good.  I dunked my toast in it and was plateaued into space. Can I bottle this raspberry jam or what? 

Breakfast and brunch are the most important meals of the day. Some people only eat once, so if your that person. You better go straight to Sugar Jam.... 

The Sunday brunch gave me LIFE.... I'll be there again very soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Mother's Day brunch. Major surprise. Delicious brisket hash! delicious pork hash! incredible veggie hash as well as unbelievable cakes!! mouthwatering apple wood smoked bacon. Cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for lunch and we shared the herb roasted turkey panini as well as a blueberry muffin. The muffin came out first and was delicious. Had a hint of cinnamon and was very sweet. The panini was amazing. The sweetness of the turkey was paired with the savory taste of the bacon and chipotle remoulade. Would come again!"}
{"text":"SugarJam Bake Shop is one of Scottsdale's hidden gems. The employees treat you like an honored guest, the atmosphere/interior design is cozy and positive, and the food...don't even get me started. SugarJam's food earns 5 Stars on its own; when combined with the owner's warm hospitality, SugarJam is an unmatched treasure.

I ordered a chocolate cake with raspberry buttercream frosting for my birthday party. I picked it up without a hitch, and as I took my first bite, my taste buds soared into ecstatic oblivion and beyond."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best pies I've ever tasted! Such a cute bakery and great customer service. We came in the day before Thanksgiving in the evening, fingers crossed that they still had pies left, and they were well stocked! I was impressed! We bought the apple pie with caramel drizzle on top, and pecan pie. The apple pie was so good, not only were the dogs begging, but the rabbit too! We plan to come back to try the brunch, and of course to buy more sweets. Thank you Sugar Jam!"}
{"text":"Found this place as a vendor at the Willo District Home Tour (actually I saw a sign that said DESSERTS and made a beeline for it!) and I was glad I did! Bought and tried their salted caramel cookies, the Kitchen Sink cookies (which have potato chips in them) and their apple pie. I'm pretty sure I gained a few pounds but it was SO. WORTH. IT. Everything was soooo good and I'll def. hit their store to try their other items!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this cute little bake shop this morning as I was in the early.  It's tucked away in the Scottsdale Airpark area.  

Decor: quaint and homey.  Comfortable.  Clean as can be.

Service: Dana(owner I believe) and Sophie were both friendly and easy to talk to.  Explained everything and any question I had in detail.  

Food: Honestly, very tasty.  I ordered a Black Forest ham, egg, and cheese croissant that was delicious-buttery, savory.  Also ordered 3 cookies-2 sea salt chocolate chip toffee and one chocolate chip.  Just ate a sea salt toffee.  My intention was to have one bite.  Intention turned into eating the whole cookie in a matter of minutes.  Guilty pleasure: 1  Intention: 0"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Everything tasted homemade, my husband had the egg croissant and I had the all American plate which was delicious! and the service was exceptional! Everyone is really nice and they make you feel really comfortable.  This was our first time, and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Gimme more MOJO SAUCE!! This adorable and very friendly shop hits a home run with their pull pork sandwich. I love everything about this sandwich. The bun is perfect. I had a side of slaw. The slaw had a little sweetness that I really liked. I wish I would have ordered a side of Cowboy Beans, next time.
I was greeted and treated extremely well. The BBQ chef came over and chatted with me. Such a nice man. He makes all the sauces from scratch and those sauces ROCK!! 
I brought home a coconut cream pie and it is delicious. The crust didn't hold together but it is yummy. 
I can't wait to take my hubby the BBQ fanatic. I know he will try the brisket. 
The BBQ chef offered samples of the cowboy beans and the brisket but I assured him I will be back with the hubby."}
{"text":"Cute cozy place.  Warm and welcoming staff.  I had the BBQ pork hash, eggs and toast.  The hash was very tasty.  My husband had the turkey pesto sandwich which was a good portion and also tasty.  When checking out we ordered a chocolate chip cookie to share and the person checking us out who I think was the owner said it was on the house.  We took the cookie to go and it was very tasty.  Cute little place tucked in the Scottsdale Hayden Business area."}
{"text":"I came for brunch and to order a chocolate cake for a birthday. I wasn't impressed with the breakfast I but the cake was delicious. I am not sure if I will be back anytime soon, but so happy I've tried it."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here and were not disappointed. I had the waffles with strawberries and cream. It was delightful and probably the best waffle I ever had. The bacon was also amazing. My sister had the croissant sandwich which she said was as good as any she's had. We also tried a side of biscuits and gravy which weren't our favorite. It was a brown gravy, not white like we are used to. Adorable little restaurant."}
{"text":"This sweet potato pie I'm eating right now is so delicious and perfect that I had to stop (on Christmas Day!) and write this review!

First of all, if you've never had sweet potato pie, it's 100000x better than pumpkin pie! You will never want pumpkin pie again after tasting sweet potato pie. And THIS sweet potato pie is the sweet potato pie to end all sweet potato pies!

I couldn't help myself, I had to try it before the turkey was done and WOW.  It's perfect.  The spices are perfect.  The crust is phenomenal.  The consistency is perfect.  I can't say enough about the high quality of this pie! Several guests had never had sweet potato pie and when they tried it, they agreed, as they always do, that it puts pumpkin pie to shame.

I'm beyond impressed.  I cannot wait to try their other baked goods and let me tell you, I know where I'm getting my birthday cake in February!"}
{"text":"Just had the most incredible brunch at this locally-owned gem in Scottsdale. The food was great and service matched. A wonderful owner is on-site and cares about her business and her customers' satisfaction and delight. We will be back again and often!"}
{"text":"Peg and I are always on the lookout for privately owned all-in kinda places.While Sugar Jam has been open about 3 years, they have recently begun with Sunday brunch....much to our win!
Applewood smoked pull pork hash sauteed with peppers,onions and potatoes,served with two fluffy scrambled eggs, and delicious butter croissant with fresh made jam was one of pulled pork and sauteed onions  served on bacon cheddar scones with diced potatoes (hasish-shy for lack of a better description). The coffee (always n important factor) was strong and flavorful. Joan, our server. was also a huge fan...and she lived in Seattle.  That is always a great endorsement in my book. The BBQ sauce is a dark tomato based brown sugar with other goodies..brought back end heat. The Mojo Thunder sauce was thinner, more vinegary based and had a very balanced sweetness. To go...a few of their sprinkled cookies, and a \"personal\" size portion of a cherry tart and a pecan piece of goodness. Lucas was a wonderful cheerleader,  Dana Dumas is the founder and with her husband Bryan being the pitmaster. , they have created a wonderful mash-up of legit bakery and breakfast place. Dr. B"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I almost hesitated to post a review because I selfishly want to keep it a hidden gem. Best jams I've tasted, especially the raspberry. Fabulous scones. Food is made from scratch and you can taste the quality. Like being in the proverbial grandma's kitchen. Looking forward to coming back and trying the pies."}
{"text":"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful! This cafe has a small-town vibe with big-time flavors. Not only does this place offer a quiet escape from the norm, it offers eats and sweets that are so familiar yet not what you can get everywhere else. My family of four had an amazing experience. The owner took the time to adjust my children's meal so they would enjoy it and she brought a cookie sandwich over for them free of charge when they had finished up. My husband and I loved our meals and desserts. Loved my lemon bar, but the cherry pie is to die for -- so sweet!

Update: We ordered a pumpkin pie for pick-up and it was even better than the cherry. Light, yet substantial. Sweet, yet hearty. I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"You would never know that this eclectic breakfast/brunch place was here in this business complex!  The owners are very welcoming, and the baked goods look AMAZING!  We had Sunday Brunch there, and the menu was not the usual boring brunch fare.  Even my kids loved it.  Plus, they gave us a free sample of yummy poppers as we were waiting for our food.  If you'd like something more homey and warm than the typical  breakfast places, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Soo disappointing! My coworker and I discovered this place right by our work and wanted to try it for the first time. She left to pick it up and while standing in line, she was approached by a man who she thought might be the owner. He told her she was not welcome there and she needed to leave! She was so embarrassed and confused as she was escorted out. Why did she get kicked out? We have no clue..."}
{"text":"We wanted something different and this place was great! Excellent service and we tried a brisket paninni and Brian's bowl with perfect pulled pork and delicious coleslaw with apples over mac and cheese.  I wanted to try a dessert because everything looked good but I was too full.  If I return to Scottsdale, this will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  I randomly stopped in with my daughter for lunch. We ordered a smoked chicken salad and the baked  Mac n cheese. Both were worth ordering again and again! The smoked chicken was amaaaazing! The honey mustard dressing was so tasty!  I will definitely be coming in again and recommend trying this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Waitress apparently forgot we were there, as we had to ask at front counter to have our order taken. Still wasnt served our food 20-30 min after we order. We walked out without eating, were in the restaurant about 45 minutes total and didnt eat."}
{"text":"Damn this food is yummy! Pulled pork Mac & cheese. Delicious! 
A true neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Duuuuuuude, this place was soooooooo GOOOOOOD!!!! I went there this morning for the first time with a friend and we both loved it. Not only is the food delicious and fresh, but the employees are very friendly and accomodating and the decor of this place is soooooo cuuuuute!!!! I got a scone there and let me tell you something, Sugar Jams showed Starbucks up by a long shot!!! Crusty on the outside but soft and moist on the inside...mmmmm!!!! The whole plce was just so quaint and different from the typical, like something you would read about in a book but never actually see!!! Oh and did i mention that they have decent prices too?! Im goung write about this place on my blog, ClassicMaryMoments.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"We found Sugar Jam by accident but our lives have been forever changed by this little gem. Not sure how they came up with BBQ and baked goods thrown together but we are all the better for it. The mac 'n cheese is a gastronomic delight that cannot be described in mere words. You must try it. The sandwich meat is so tender it melts in your mouth. The salads are sweet, fresh, and mouthwatering. The smoked chicken on top is to die for. This just replaced our top restaurant and we will be here on every vacation. Seek this one out, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich and beans and my friend had turkey panini. Both of us were very happy with the food. It is a great little place to have meal and talk."}
{"text":"This has recently became a favorite breakfast stop when in the area. Today have orange juice now and waffles with ham coming. Unusual that I'm here without other customers sitting. Hmmm. Lucky me. Service is great!!!
Waffle is best I have had anywhere ever. Eggs appear to be poured from a bottle or ?  I want my egg to be an obvious egg! This...hard to say. Thin sliced ham..kinda same. Just ok. 
So it seems quite different here than my previous. And maybe explains why I'm still the only customer here. 
So I'm dinging them pretty deep because only the waffle was excellent. 
New customers entering now however."}
{"text":"Hard to see from the road, you park and enter in the back. Well worth the search. Passed this place a million times but couldn't figure out how to get in. Tried BBQ brisket sandwich (no slaw) today. It is pulled pork consistency. Was very tender and juicy. Will definitely be back. Came at 1130 and had the place to myself. Let's help support this local little business!"}
{"text":"I had ordered The caramel apple pie and the cherry apple almond amaretto for thanksgiving and everyone loved it! The Caramel Apple was definitely my favorite along with my fianc√©!  The place is absolutely adorable!! I'll definitely start coming there more often!"}
{"text":"Darling bistro and bake shop run by a passionate, visionary chef (Dana). Tasty, plentiful breakfast. Everything was homemade."}
{"text":"Best cherry pie I've ever had, if I were a local or even lived in this state I would be here every day. Dad loved it too:)"}
{"text":"The best strawberry rhubarb pie in Arizona, hands down!! I can't wait to try other things in this cute Parisian bake shop. I'll have dreams of this pie"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little restaurant and the food is even better! The restaurant has the southern swanky feel to it. I thoroughly enjoyed the Applewood smoked pulled pork mac & cheese. I'm very impressed by all of the homemade desserts from cookies to pies to pastries to muffins to cakes! I will definitely be back to check out the highly talked about brunch."}
{"text":"Celebrated my sisters birthday here. It was our first time and found it in Yelp.  The staff was so accommodating and the food was da bomb!! The pulled pork is to die for!! The homemade jam is excellent and the coffee on point. I highly recommend this wonderful gem of a place!! We even met Sugar the owner."}
{"text":"I really did want to like this place!!!
I called SugarJam a day and a half before Thanksgiving to pre-order a couple of pies. The young lady was very nice on the phone and I was told that it was too late to place an order but if I showed up at 8:30 in the morning the day before Thanksgiving they were going to have a couple pies available to the general public. So I set my alarm, grabbed my coffee and was out in front at 8 o'clock in the morning, was first in line!  Within minutes people started showing up behind me and the anticipation was palatable but.....I think I was going to get my pie's! 
The doors were open at 8:30, and a young man greeted me. He jumped behind the counter and this is where it started  started to go wrong. 
It was quite obvious he was not comfortable behind the counter. He gave me the impression that this was his first day or was filling in for somebody. Definitely not a position you would want to be in when it was probably going to be extremely busy!
I reviewed the menu online spoke to a couple friends and knew I wanted a cherry pie, and also my favorite a pecan pie....a plain pecan pie mind you, NOT one with additional chocolate chips. As I watched the young man pull the pies from the case I reiterated once again that I wanted the a pecan pie no chocolate chips! Let's say the transaction for a payment was awkward but I was just happy I got my pies!
I think some of you may while you're reading this awfully long review Are going to come to the realization before I actually say it.... after a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner, I served my pecan pie and guess what chocolate chips in side my pie!! (some of you might think oh well it can't be that bad but I was that person growing up that I always wanted the sugar cookie or the vanilla ice cream hate chocolate)!
I also noticed that when I was cutting the cherry pie how very runny the filling was.
The presentation was awful luckily I just covered the whole thing up with whip cream!  With expectations being so high and the cost of two pies equaling $54 I was very disappointed! Combine this with zero customer service, SugarJam receives one *  and that's because of your cute label sorry guys!!!"}
{"text":"The best hidden gem in all of Scottsdale. 

Amazing homemade pastries; cookies, scones, muffins, cream pies, etc.

And fabulous Saturday brunch.

And daily lunch."}
{"text":"This store is so adorable. You are taken in by the charm of this little shop right when you walk in, with the cute little decorations, accents, and the explosion of lovely pastries that seem to surround you as you browse. In addition to baked goods they offer sandwiches for breakfast and lunch. The bbq meat in the lunch sandwiches are made by a pitmaster they work with.

I ordered a turkey breakfast sandwich with peppers and onions, and an assortment of baked goodies including an almond amaretto cookie, oatmeal cookie sandwich with buttercream filling, chocolate chip cookie sandwich with vanilla buttercream filling, peach cobbler cookies, and an apple pie muffin. 

The turkey sandwich was excellent. The croissant it was served on was huge, and the turkey meat was well seasoned and plentiful. It didn't taste like that super processed stuff that you find in generic round loaves in shrink wrapped plastic. The peppers and onions were the perfect compliment to the fluffy scrambled egg, meat, and cheddar cheese. 

The pastries were good, but a little too sugary sweet for my tastes (The generic \"sugar\" taste was overpowering the other flavors) . The textures were perfect though, especially for the almond amaretto cookie. It had the right balance of chewy with a slight amount of crunch.

Service was excellent and the gentleman at the counter knew the menu well and was very friendly.

The total for the sandwich and the ton of baked goods I got was around $26.

If I'm in the area around lunch I'll definitely be back to try some bbq sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and very professional staff. I had a very bad experience at Barb's Bakery in Phoenix and I googled SugarJam Bake Shop and let me say you will not be disappointed. The service all the way down to the details of the ordering is beyond superb and the owners gave the best customer service that exceeded expectations. I will definitely be back and looking forward to working with a bakery that knows how to successfully operate a business."}
{"text":"Nice little place. It's hidden so can be hard to find.  Good is excellent. The service was friendly but slow.  Waited good while and then had items brought out one at a time about 3-4 minutes apart. They were busy with take out orders for Christmas. I would come again and hope for better services."}
{"text":"We tried to eat at the sugar jam for lunch today.  The gentleman at the register told us to take a seat and someone would be with us.  He stood at the register and took people's orders at the counter who came in after us.  No one ever came to our table or acknowledged us so after watching him serve 3 more sets of people, we got up and left.  He just watched us leave and never said a word.  We won't ever go back..."}
{"text":"Quaint and cozy! Yummy homemade food and friendly service from the owners Sugar and Jam!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, home baked pies, pastries and more! Wonderful atmosphere and staff could not have been nicer!"}
{"text":"First time here, disappointed.  The waiter does not know the menu, he told me fruit cup came with the breakfast it did not, he told me the a la carte items were the sides they were not.  He never asked how the food was. He was on his cell phone the whole time listening to someone screaming and watching baseball.  There are only 3 sandwiches items for breakfast on weekdays,  The place was empty when I arrived @ 0930.  No one was friendly along with the misinformation, not a good place.  The breakfast sandwich I did have was very tasty, but then they did not have any lunch items as I wanted to take one home but I had to leave and come back @ 11 am to order lunch.  I did get the crumb cake, the waiter said they made it with coffee in the cake but since he misinformed me about most everything on the menu, not sure if this is true.  The crumbs were spot on but the cake very dense when it should be light and airy.  The bbq sandwich I ordered for home the menu is very confusing and you do not get what you ordered, plus they have an upcharge for mac and cheese which the waiter misinformed me about also, The upcharge is not worth it as you get less than 2 tablespoons of boring mac and cheese $1.99.  Also not really sure the price for the bbq sandwiches seems overpriced $9.50 seems high.  While the food was pretty good, the staff was anything but, from the waiter not knowing the menu to the owner being ungrateful, unfriendly and angry.  The trip back is not worth the frustration.  Women please be careful as the sink in the ladies room moves and not very steady.  The place has a great layout with great pictures but it seems like a facade because the dining area is welcoming and the staff is definitely not. No Hello, thanks for coming and no goodbye and no one was smiling or looked happy to be there The owner should be more customer service oriented and she fell short this time.  After dealing with her, I am sure she will respond with something negative."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy little bistro amidst an industrial park, Sugar Jam specializes in your typical fare of desserts (cookies, pies, brownies, etc.) and also offers up breakfast and lunch menus that will keep you coming back to try something new.

Speaking of new, today (04/21/2918) they tried out a new Apple Wood Smoked Bacon Pulled Pork Pepperjack Hamburger. Apparently I was their first patron to order one.

        * * * * * Oh My Gawd! * * * * *  
* * * * * Un-Freaken Believable!! * * * * *

I like good BBQ and have only come across a few places in the Valley that does it right, and Sugar Jam nailed it!

Service today was a little off (I had to wait 10 more minutes AFTER my girlfriend's order got dropped for my order to arrive) but the flavor of the burger and the Cowboy Beans made up for a potential one star deduction.

If you haven't tried this place out, you should. It is that good!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, We were with our kids who were acting up. They brought over 6 mini muffins, bacon/chive, chocolate chip on the house that was very good. I ordered the sj which came with fresh croissant, fluffy eggs, and shredded BBQ pork. I loved it all but the bbq had a little bit of sweet flavor which I wasn't crazy about. Bacon had great flavor. Also brought side of ham and eggs for free which was very good. Wife had French toast, she loved it. We will be back"}
{"text":"SugarJam is that rare (almost unique) combination of a bakery and a BBQ spot.  It is located in a small office complex space, and is really barely big enough to be either.  The result is that the excellent food is somewhat compromised by the non-existent ambiance and the very small selection. 

For example, for lunch, you basically have sliced turkey, bbq chopped brisket, or bbq pulled pork.  Now both the brisket and pork were great, the beans exemplary, and even the bread far above average, but I wish they gave me more choices so I could come back a few times -- maybe sliced brisket, bbq chicken or salmon, etc.

Similarly there are only a few bakery selections and only a very few of each.  If someone comes in before you and orders peach pie you are out of luck.

I wish SugarJam the best of fortune and hope they grow into what they can be."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we must have caught them on an off day. The wait for our food was almost an hour on Sunday. Our food was lukewarm and potatoes burnt. Noticed several folks returning their burned French toast. The menu is enticing but the delivery is underwhelming. Sorry because we wanted it to be special-- in a good way"}
{"text":"Our daughter loved her Minnie birthday cake!! We called a few days in advance and it was ready no problem. The chocolate cake with Oreo filling was very rich and delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new for lunch on a Saturday so of course I checked my Yelp bookmarks and Sugar Jam was it today. This is a hidden gem tucked away in a business park. 

We walked in and very interesting. Small little place with the counter and the bakery goods to temp you right away. Their menu is on a chalk board behind the counter. So what you do is order and pay. Find a table and they bring you your food. Little interesting, after we found our table they give brought a table mat and drinks. Your silver ware and napkins are already at the table. 

So when it came time to order, I already knew what I wanted and ordered The Boss Hog. This was a six inch long sandwich with pulled pork, chopped brisket with homemade slaw and BBQ sauce on top. It came with a side of potato salad and potato chips. Oh my gosh. This was so good. Loved the sandwich. It just came together with the slaw in top and the BBQ sauce. Wasn't dry at all. Really tasty and fresh. As you can tell I enjoyed this a lot. The potato salad was so good too. Really enjoyed this meal. It hit the spot. 

The owners dad served us and he was so friendly. He really made our visit special. Very happy man. He brought out another BBQ sauce called the mojo. Really good. Nice kick to it. You got to try this mojo sauce. He also gave me a sample of their homemade cowboy beans. Made me think twice about the potato salad. So I don't think you can go wrong in picking the potato salad or the cowboy bean. Both are excellent. 

My wife and daughter ordered the chicken walnut & cranberry salad on a croissant. First thing my daughter said was oh my gosh. The croissant was so fresh and I snuck a bit and it was so good. Down right good. They all loved it. They even split the sandwich on separate plates with their side. Really good. The owners dad gave both my daughter and wife samples of both their pulled pork and chopped brisket. They love it too. That BBQ sauce really makes it really good. Sweet and spicy. Nice. 

To top off our meal, we got a personal raspberry pie and a apple pie. A la mode. Perfect size to share. We all like the raspberry the best but they were both really good. We liked the food so much here that we bought a cherry crumb pie to go. Looked so good and I'm always a sucker for cherry pie. I have to admit it was good. Very good. 

So service was great. Not busy at all. There was another table but nice and quiet. The owners dad was so friendly and just loves to talk to you. It felt like you're at home eatin a homemade meal. I really loved this place and looking forward to trying the rest of their menu. They have breakfast too. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Tucked away little gem of a shop. Clearly a labor of love. I had the big bacon and egg croissant and cherry pie, both spot on. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop by this little place!! It's like going to your neighbor's parents place and eating wholesome southern cooking. They have mac and cheese with BBQ meats with collared greens which I passed on since we are here for brunch! The waffle was simply amazing, so crispy with their special flavored butter...the eggs are so fluffy...their ham was fantastic as well...the bacon was decent and the french toast was good but no where close to the waffle. That is a can't miss!! Ended with heated sweet potato pie with scoop of ice cream!!"}
{"text":"What a delightful discovery! Absolutely the best waffle I've ever put in my mouth. Scrambled eggs are light and fluffy. Bakery items are to die for...
Decor is great and customer service is superb! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We visited this yummy bakeshop on Saturday morning around 9 am. The workers were friendly. The restaurant cute. We ordered the SJ breakfast and the brisket, biscuits, and gravy. Both were delicious and a good sized portion. Afterwards, we tried a personal pecan pie to share. It was terrific. The crust was a good consistency and the pecan filling was awesome.

The owner was friendly and chatted with us about all the different yummy pies she makes! We will definitely be back to try more BBQ and pies!"}
{"text":"We found this place from yelp and I was impressed with the high ratings.

Sugar Jam Bake Shop & Bistro is a cute little gem tucked @ some industrial area. 

The all American plate ($9.95): 2 scrambled eggs, 2 applewood smoked bacon, sauteed potatoes, 2 slices of toast (wheat, sourdough or Texas toast) served with butter and fresh jam. My egg was fluffy and my bacon was crispy. The almond amaretto jam was good. 

Big bacon, egg and cheese croissant ($6.59): fluffy butter croissant layered with 2 eggs, applewood smoked bacon and cheddar cheese. The croissant was big and delicious. 

Coffee ($3.75): organic local roasted coffee. The coffee was pretty good. 

Our waitress, Sabrina was amazing. The owner was super cool too. She invited us to come back again for brunch, but unfortunately our schedule was fully packed. 

4 stars!!

Sugar Jam Bake Shop & Bistro is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid to review this place because I actually don't want anyone to go here because I prefer that it remain a small family shop. But in order to promote the family and their restaurant I give this place five stars for the good service and the great recipes especially the French toast. Over the months that we've gone they seem to have a rotating staff and turnover which is not necessarily a bad thing. Service can vary depending on who you get that day but the husband and wife owners have treated as kindly and sometimes go out of their way to say hi and go above and beyond for service. This place can get crowded due to its small footprint floor plan so get here early if you have a small group. This place is not obvious driving by unless they have a person with a sign directing you, but those who know, know and become the regulars. They somewhat specialize in barbecue and the dishes are available for breakfast with BBQ which is an interesting combination. All kinds of sweets are available including pies cakes and cookies and they offer whole pies to go especially in advance of holidays where you can pre-order your pie. You should go to this place but just don't tell anyone keep it a secret."}
{"text":"In visiting from Chicago and had to come try a 5 star rated place for breakfast.  What a surprise!  Not what I expected to find. Such a nice change of pace and everything I tried from the bacon to the ham and the to die for waffles with some butter, compote, and whip cream was top notch without the normal uptight feel of places that try to offer similar experiences. Music playing in the background was at a nice volume. The desserts looked incredible...I chose a Mexican chocolate cookie sandwich which had a light spicy flavor to it, not the over bearing taste of cayenne like you find in other Mexican chocolates. The staff was on top of their stuff and definitely have a love for quality and an easy going lifestyle.  The local organic coffee was a nice roast that seemed to be brewed at the correct temperature and retained a nice citrus taste and good mouth feel.  There was even a baby shower occurring while I was there and I can see why from the lovely decor and great brunch food.  This is a place where the food will bring a smile to your face with each bite.  Love, Love, Love This will be a stop for me every time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. The food was phenomenal. I ordered the French toast which was so good. We went back the next day for the pastries. Great service and a great atmosphere. I will definitely return when I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the people are great!!!
Very welcoming and friendly. Of course the food are delish"}
{"text":"So often you read mentions of local \"hidden gems\" on Yelp. What to do then when you actually find a hidden gem? A gem that really is local and hidden. Literally! My solution? Recognize one's limitations as a reviewer and embrace the clique! Did I mention Sugar Jam Bake Shop is a hidden gem?

IT'S HIDDEN: I've driven by Sugar Jam Bake Shop dozens of times and never knew it was there. Only a booth at a street fair and a follow up investigation on Yelp led to this lunch visit. Sugar Jam is located in an aging office building near the Scottsdale airport (NW corner of Hayden & Redfield Roads). No real signage on Redfield Road other than temporary placards placed outside to try to attract your attention. Parking is in the rear. Enter through a shaded courtyard. Once inside? Charming. Charming. Charming.

IT'S A GEM: Dana, the owner, greeted us at the counter as we came in on this day and then later came over to check up on us and chat. Nice. This gave us a chance to ask about the upcoming (10/1/2015) change in lunch menu. Fear not. Dana's baked goods will remain untouched, but she's bringing in \"Phil the Grill\", a \"Pitmaster Chef\", as \"seen on Chopped\", to enhance lunch offerings with pulled pork mac and cheese and the like. Sounds promising, particularly in light of how good the menu already is. 

Our lunch items, a turkey Panini and a mac and cheese with salad, were both great. Don't know though if they'll make the cut for the new menu. You can order bagged lunches to go if you like. We, however, dined in. It's just too cute a spot for us not to. Seating is limited. Some folks were settled in studying for school and reading newspapers while sipping from oversized coffee cups. Regarding dessert, every baked good we have tried has been fantastic. The namesake sugar jam cookies were a delight at the street fair. I was expecting a petrified jam-like substance adhered to stale sugar cookies. Instead, the jam was fresh and the cookies soft. Delightful. We had some again today. Small fruit pies were also flakey and flavorful. Not too sweet. Not too tart. Perfect. I'm anxious to try other pies, like the pecan sweet potato. I'm just going to have to return to Sugar Jam again and again and again until I've sampled the entire baked good menu. A sacrifice I know.

Sugar Jam does bake in quantity for special events. A multi pack of a specialty chocolate mousse, making me rethink the concept of a twelve pack, was being readied for pick up as we were leaving. Dana showed it to us when she overheard us expressing interest. I would have liked an invite to that party. 

IT'S LOCAL: Sugar Jam is the very definition of a small local business deserving of local support. Hours are limited, open only M-F 8:30 a.m.- 2:00 p.m. as of this date, but I suspect they might expand hours with the change in season and/or menu. I hope so. I've now sampled Sugar Jam twice. Met the owner Dana twice. Met the owner's husband once. Know a bit about their kids. Feel a little like I know them, or at least know them well enough to want to support their endeavor. Planning on becoming a regular. You should too. If you can find this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork and potato salad were awesome!! Small little spot not the easiest to find... But well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try because my co-worker was talking up a storm on how this place is so amazing; however, I did not have the experience my friend had because the service sucked and the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. 

It's in a rather obscure place - inside an office building in kind of an out-of-the-way place behind Scottsdale Airpark, but it's obvious they have quite the following.

The place is small and cute - very quaint. There is a wide variety of their baked goods on display to tempt your eyes.

My colleagues and I all got the same sandwich: the Chicken Salad on Croissant. It was fantastic! The chicken salad had nuts and cranberries in it and a little heat in the background. The apple slaw was very delicious. My colleagues both had the cowboy beans and both loved them.

We each got a sweet treat to enjoy later... some of those baked goods on display. I really enjoyed my brownie.

It's a small place that will be very hard to get into in short order. So get there while you can!

The food was a little expensive, but I'm perfectly OK paying a little more for great food that was lovingly prepared by a locally owned business. The money I paid will stay in the community rather than some corporate fatcat back east. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is seriously *such* a hidden gem; you would never even know that this restaurant exists, and it certainly doesn't catch your eye if you happen to be driving through the airpark. We came here for lunch and not only was the service impeccable and super friendly, but HOLY cow was the food amazing. They have great BBQ and their desserts? Forget about it. Come here for a cheat day for sure. :)"}
{"text":"We found Sugar Jam on Yelp one morning while looking for breakfast nearby. It was a little hard to spot as it is in an unusual area, in a somewhat industrial looking building, kind of hidden. Well, when we first walked in, I couldn't  help but notice the adorable and quirky decor and the beautiful pastries on display! We were soon greeted by our awesome server. Unfortunately , I didn't catch her name, but she was friendly, energetic and just cool! She offered up some suggestions and we went with them. But first, she brought out a fantastic cup of coffee. I went with the apple chicken sausage, scrambled eggs, and waffle. My husband had the pulled pork hash. The chicken sausage was crisp, juicy and delicious. The eggs were perfect and the waffle was awesome! I don't care for the taste of nutmeg because I think it's a bit overpowering, so when I had my first bite of the waffle, I was kind of thrown...but by the second bite, I couldn't stop eating! Served with fresh strawberries and fresh whipped cream...So good. My husband loved his pulled pork hash and ended up buying a bottle of their mojo sauce because it was so good. The owner of the place came out to check on us and chat, and she was so nice and genuine. You could just tell that she has a passion and love for what she is doing. Then the chef came out to check on us and see if we were enjoying our meal. She too, was so genuine! Wow! Amazing service! This is the type of business you just want to see do well because it is so well deserved! If you are in the area, I highly recommend going to Sugar Jam!"}
{"text":"Cute & cozy place. Food was good-we had the Brian's Big BBQ Bowl & it was really yummY. Had to finish up with a raspberry filled lemon cookie that tasted sooo good."}
{"text":"This charming little cafe is the best!  Great coffee, amazing baked goods (I loved the apricot scones and the buttery croissants)!  I can't wait to try the pies.  The staff is warm and delightful.  I love the owner, Leon.  We discussed jazz while I enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I just tried the pies the other day and had cookies on various occasions that I enjoy. I think they have something great going on with the pies and cookies. Unique flavors and delicious! 

However, I didn't have the greatest customer service on Father's Day yesterday. We made a reservation in the morning. When we got there on time, our table was not ready. So a waiter wiped it down shortly. He didn't do the best job cleaning, as we had to get napkins ourselves and clean off some spilled sugar on the table. Our basket at the table did not have any napkins, nor did our waiter refill it, so we grabbed some from another table. I later asked our waiter to see a list of their pies; he said he would bring me a to-go menu. I never did see him back at our table, not even with the to-go menu. 

We waited an hour for our food. Not sure what took so long, no one even checked up on us to let us know it will take long. I went to the cash register and reminded them about our food to see what was taking so long. Five minutes later, our food is brought out. Not even at an apology for the wait. My dad was not too happy about this and he said he would not return. 

I am leaving this review so the restaurant can see and make improvements so customers don't leave unhappy."}
{"text":"Absolutely charming shop. Limited menu but the food is fresh & delicious. Had the Herb Seasoned Turkey w/cheddar, Applewood Smoked Bacon,Peppers & Onions panini. I chose a side of slaw which had just the right amount of dressing. SO GOOD. Had a busy schedule so no time for coffee & dessert that day but it's on my radar - lovely choices."}
{"text":"My sister in law placed an order for a two layer cake for my mothers retirement party. And to say I was wowed would be an understatement. Sugar Jam knocked it out of the park and the cake was a total hit at the party!! I also purchased 1/2 cookies and went back for birthday cupcakes a few weeks later. I think it's safe to say that I found my new bakery!"}
{"text":"First time there yesterday!! Yummy!
The food is authentic, real deal Mac n Cheese, Cowboy beans and Cole slaw to die for.. Pulled pork and brisket amazing.. We have only begun and will be going back regularly.. The folks in there are super nice. Restores my faith in real customer service and kindness.. Love this place.."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Dana (owner) is passionate about what she does and brings a fantastic energy to the place.  

I came for the Cherry / Blueberry Homemade Personal Pies. (delicious)

I stayed for the Kitchen Sink Cookies. (Dana's recommendation / unbelievably tasty)"}
{"text":"This place is so good.  I am writing this review as I sit here in a food coma.  I had the brisket, biscuits and  gravy and it was very flavorful.  A+ food and service.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really really delicious! Go here. 

Now, for the bad stuff (which doesn't lower their stars). 

First:
The charge to our credit card we actually used the card three times, because our group didn't arrive all at once), as reported by the bank, matched neither the pre-tip ammount nor the post-tip ammount. On any of the three charges. It was close, and maybe less in aggregate, than what we thought it should be, but, still, it was odd. 

Second:
The pie was expensive. It was good, but for your regular friends, just get them Polly's Pies or Maria Callendars. Maybe only get this for someone who you really want to get into bed or something. 

Third:
My mom, when she really doesn't like something, adds \"that\" to the noun, as in \"Steve Garvey's wife ran off with _that_ Marvin Hamlisch.\"
Well, she said \"They put _that_ clove in their pies.\" I liked the odd flavor the clove imparted, but just be warned: they put that clove in some of their baked goods. 

Overall, great lunch place and beautiful and delicious baked stuff. 

None of this review is meant, in any way, to let Cyndy Garvey off the hook for cheating on Steve. Bad, BAD girl!"}
{"text":"This is certainly a five-star spot.  Yes, it is a little pricey (coffee - $3.75) but it is worth every penny.  Food was excellent (French toast made with thick cuts of challah (egg) bread.  This is also served with two scrambled eggs.  Plenty to eat.  Service was excellent and staff is very friendly.  Had a conversation with the owner, Brian (his wife is the co-owner), and learned a lot about their story.  These folks really work very hard to earn your business and they deserve the support of the community."}
