{"text":"The place is new and clean. My favor is the house special noodle dish. The wudalang pancake is a must-try dish. Looking forward to try the braised brisket hand pull noodle next time. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised today on my first visit! Walking in, the place is clean, but appears a bit drabby and tired looking. But the quality of the noodles is fantastic.  The menu is extensive. In addition to those signature noodles, there is the usual Chinese fare of stir fry beef, chicken, pork, or seafood with the various permutation of sauces.  We tried the beef brisket hand pulled noodle soup and the stir fry noodle with beef. The soup version is much better.   The texture of the noodle is absolutely perfect! Just the right amount of chewiness. The broth is not as salty as most Japanese Ramen joints. It is the perfect comfort food. They pull the noodle right after you order, which is as fresh as it gets. Reason I found out is because I asked to buy some uncooked noodles to take home. And the chef informed us that it has to get cooked as soon as he pulls it, otherwise it will clump together.  The stirfry noodle with beef was not as good as the noodle soup. It was incredibly greasy, even by any Chinese-stirfry standard. The beef they use is tough, though the thin cut, drenched in grease does lessen the perception of poor beef quality.   Each dish is $8 (for the large noodle soup, small is $7), and the portion size is huge. Each dish is guaranteed to feed your average 250Ib beefcake.  To summarize, amazing amazing noodle texture in a lovely comfort-bowl soup, cheap, large portions. Greasy stirfry with poor quality beef."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after a friend mentioned this restaurant has a robot that cuts their noodles. They have a 10% discount during their grand opening, and the portion-to-price ratio is quite good, comparable to other restaurants in Chinatown. Service is a bit slow, but it is to be expected of their recent opening.  They serve mostly standard Northwestern Chinese fare, like kebabs and Lanzhou-style noodles. My friend and I tried their green onion pancake and radish salad for appetizers. Appetizers were of fair quality. For our mains, we had their robot-cut noodles with sliced pork and braised pork for mains. The noodles weren't too bad and seemed quite authentic, but the pork was too overcooked.   Overall, I would suggest give their noodles a try, but don't get the pork. At the very least, go and check out their robot noodle cutter, it's an interesting retro contraption complete with light up eyes and robotic noises."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident when the girlfriend and I were walking around Chinatown. Eventually we came back to try out the noodles. There weren't many people in the joint so we were a bit wary, but after sitting down the service was very good. We got our food in reasonable time and the portion was surprisingly big. The soup was delicious and authentic but the best part was the noodles, which were really springy. Large bowl coated $8 plus tax/tip. I spoke to the chef after and he was very kind. Apparently it's not on the menu but you can select many more different thicknesses for the noodle to suit your liking. He also mentioned that this place had only opened for a month.  All in all, great place with authentic noodles. I will certainly return again."}
{"text":"Super Noodle Express ?????? is an unassuming noodle place in Chinatown. Their Lanzhou Lamian is one of the better ones I have ever tired in Toronto. Interestingly, there is a noodle machine that is in a shape of ultraman. Their lamb skewer is a pleasant surprise. Bursting with rich flavours of cumin and other spices, the skewers are of generous portion. If you have a craving for a late night snack with hearty beef broth, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and was both delighted and disappointed.   The bad part first I guess. The washroom was gross, went in to take a leak and was actually grossed out. They had a sign on the front door saying \"washroom for customers only\" and I'm saying they should just put a picture of it on the front door to deter any prospectors. The only other complaint was that the fried rice we ordered was salty. Like really really salty. Sam and Dean could have made a few shot gun shells out of it. Was really disappointed with that mainly because it's the easiest thing to make.  The good part. The staff was amazing. Really clean, attentive, polite, and nice. I felt like I was an important customer the whole time. The opposite side of the spectrum, the eating area was clean and well taken care of. The beef and pepper sauce we ordered was amazing and helped dilute the salt with light rice we ordered. Honestly, I'm chalking the rice up to just an accident because everything else, service wise, was impeccable."}
{"text":"Another place specialized in handed made pull noodle.  Came during a not so busy Saturday afternoon.  The decor is clean and simple.  Have tried ox tripe in chilly oil and spicy shredded chicken for appetizer.  Ox tripe comes with tiny bit of sesame on to top.  It's quite appetizing, I would prefer it to be more spicy so I added some more chilly oil.  I don't feel much about spicy shredded chicken because it's all white meat.  The portion of the noodle is big for a large order, broth is hot and decent but texture of the noodle occasionally misses the mark.  Another type of noodle they serve is machine cut slice noodle, I think personally I would prefer this type of noodle.  Very yummy with good texture.  Price is average and they don't skimp on the portion.  Overall I enjoy the meal and would frequent this place."}
{"text":"With all the restaurants in the area, how did we ended up here? Because I saw the word \"Super\" and \"Noodle\". What a gem this little place is. Served mainly noodle dishes, Northern China dishes, hot pots and some unique dishes. Establishment deco is simple and clean.  When there's a \"House Special\" on the menu, you got to try it. Got the House Special Hand-pulled Noodle Soup with two types of sliced beef and a tea egg. Beef was favorable and melts in your mouth, and the tea egg had a hint of Chinese Herb you could taste. The Hand-pulled Noodle with Braised Beef Brisket was heaven, beef brisket was tender, and the broth was perfect with a hint of star anise spice. We also got the Fried Sliced Noodle with Beef, beef was tender and crunch from the cabbage was a good mix.  They also offered \"Robot Sliced Noodle\", yes they do have a real robot that slices the noodle, check it out in the back of the dinning area along with the gentleman pulling the fresh noodle. And one more note, this is a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Late in posting this, but we visited Labor Day weekend. The food was delicious, and it was cool to watch our food being made. Within 5 minutes of sitting down, we had water, menus, and our order was taken- far better than some other places we'd recently visited. Delicious food, and a nice family-run establishment"}
{"text":"I invited two of my dearest friends to \"lunch\" today, and we decided to give Super Noodle Express a go. I've previously experienced the joy of Hand Pulled Noodles (the most sensual of the pulled noodles). This place did not disappoint.   Conversation did, however, leave a bit to be desired. It seemed that each individual was trying to progress their own agenda, giving very little thought to what had already been said. Not much of a dialogue. More like 3 individuals dribbling on in their own respective vacuum. It would be difficult for me to even summarize the various themes of what was said.  Nonetheless, I'd recommend Super Noodle Express for a no frills experience of hand pulled noodles. Do not go with the machine pulled variety as they lack character and body, and the menu refers to them as \"Noodls\" (omitting the \"e\" for some reason)."}
{"text":"The noodles are handmade fresh on-site.  I have the noodle with beef brisket.  The brisket is just cooked right, not too soft and good to chew on and it's properly seasoned, same as the broth.  The noodle is very good as it is freshly made, spongy and chewy.  Just the right texture for this type of noodle.  Friendly noodle maker, will perform and pose for you when you ask."}
{"text":"We tried two bowls this evening: the braised brisket and the house special.   The noodles are very good.  Both the hand pulled and the \"robot\" cut (whatever that means) had nice texture.  It's too bad there's not much meat in each bowl.  The broths were just alright.  Neither had enough flavour for my liking.     The side dish of julienned potatoes was okay too.  I think it's worth a try to come back for some other non-broth noodles and various menu items.    I would love to just buy the noodles and take them home to cook myself."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for any place that does hand pulled noodles. I split a small order of the hot and sour hand pulled noodles and the vegetarian fried noodles with a friend. At the back of the restaurant, I literally watched the chef pull our noodles. It's a lot of fun to watch and quite mesmerizing. The soup was tasty and the fried noodles were amazing! We were stuffed and had leftovers to take home. For the price, this place is great."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Super Noodle Express.  Last time I came was when they first opened. Their menu has changed since then and is now full of colourful pictures, which is great if you're not sure what you're reading.   They have daily specials, which also hsve pictures.  Got the house special hand pulled noodle, based on the picture. It came basically as advertised, except maybe the egg was cut in half instead of just a whole egg sitting in the bowl. It's good when the advertisement reflects the product you will get.  Soup is very light. Noodles have a nice texture, but not much flavour. The sliced meats that come with it are great and very tender; would be nice if the soup and noodles had internalized more of that flavour.  Large bowl is somewhat larger than the small, but only costs an extra $1.  The place supposedly accepts cards, but apparently it was down, so cash only. Kind of inconvenient and I ended up just blurting out whether they had a discount on cash only payments, and the guy offered 5% off meals over $30. Probably not usual but since the machine was down and you know, service...  Kind of wish the noodles had more flavor, but the dishes we had were all pretty good."}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed with the food. We also had to ask about 5 times for the bill before it came.  Ordered C3 (fried hand-pulled noodle with lamb). The noodles were nice and chewy but it was drenched in sauce with some sour taste to it. To me, this dish was too oily, too saucy, and had very little lamb in it.   Tried some of the appetizers as well. Both the chicken heart skewers and lamb skewers were flavoured the same - very crispy and heavy on the cumin. I wasn't a fan.  My friends who ordered the soup noodle dishes enjoyed their meals a bit more I think."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place on a weekday late evening thinking we would try something new along the Chinatown strip. Now we love hand pulled noodles so we went for the (A1) House Special Hand-pulled Noodle [Large] and also tried the 'old reliable' (D2) beef pancake. The nice and chew noodles were well complimented with the savoury broth. My only complaint about the noodle soup dish was that it had very little in terms of toppings. Instead of a nice assortment of meats and vegetables, we had two leaves of bok choi and minimal meats. The beef pancake also just okay. We both found it very \"doughy\" with not a lot inside it.   I think this place had some nice perks, but overall I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"So where do I begin? Before I dive into this tale of horror and frustration, let me just say that I'm American via the third world, so that might contextualize my anger a bit. I was craving Chinese food as I regularly do and walked down Spadina to window shop. I figured the location that contained the most people must be an indication of the restaurant's quality, etc. I order the General Tso chicken which is my go to staple at any Chinese place regardless of where in the world I am. I ask whether it includes rice and the lady says quite aggressively \"no.\" Now, I've come to realize that almost 99% of Chinese restaurants in Canada do not include white rice, which seems crazy to me. So I decide to be ostentatious, hedonistic and glamorous and order a vegetable fried rice. I ask whether I can sit while I wait for my food and the lady rolls her eyes and says, \"Ok.\" So I sit on a chair next to the register (not a table) playing with my iPhone to avoid eye contact with anyone. The food comes out fairly quickly and I proceed to pay. The total is $23. I double check to se whether that number is correct, but I figure \"what the hell, live god damnit!\" and just go with it. I proceed to pay with a card and I cannot for the life of me get rid of a $2 tip automatically included in the machine. I keep going back and pressing 0% for gratuity which makes this beeping loud sound, but it doesn't stop me from doing it at least five times. Oh no, this sound isn't going to break me, but nothing happens. The $2 tip seems to be built into the machine as a minimum. The lady is giving me a death glare that could kill babies but I just keep glaring back at her determined to get rid this $2 tip. After about what seems like an eternity I give up and walk away paying about $25 for the two items which is seriously the most I have ever paid for Chinese food anywhere. I eat the food in a state of anger and wake up the next day with violent food poisoning."}
{"text":"Amazing. General Tso chicken was the best I've had.  Server was efficient and friendly.  Not overly busy on a Sunday with is nice to come in and relax."}
{"text":"This place was the kind of restaurant you eat at and forget about. They serve a northern chinese fare offering a large selection of hand pulled noodles or sliced noodles either in broth or stir fried in wok.   We tried a stir friend lamb sliced noodle and a beef hotpot. Overall, there was nothing special at all, flavours were slightly below average, with the stir fired noodles being a little bit to sour (too much rice vinegar) for my liking and the lamb in the noodles of mediocre quality. The beef hotpot tasted just like the ones you can make at home with the flavouring packages bought in store."}
{"text":"The service is great. But the food is not impressive. I like the lamb skewer. The noodle is average. The lamb dish is good. They offer free wifi, which is a plus. They always play Chinese tv shows, some of which I love, BUT because of the unstable internet connection, the Tv shows are frequently paused. If you want to treat your clients with funny tv shows, upgrade your internet or tv systems. Paused shows are unwatchable ok?"}
{"text":"A nice friendly and enjoyable lunch. Good value and good food. Yes this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"My \"friend\" invited me to this place because it has hand pulled noodles.  Personally, I don't care whether my noodles are hand or machine pulled, pushed, squished or smushed... so long as they taste and feel good inside my mouth.    We ordered a noodle soup each (A5), plus a shared fried noodle plate (C1, I believe)  The soup was a strong 3.5/5; flavorful broth, healthy serving of noodles and meat, overall clean and balanced flavor.    The fried noodle was excellent 4.5/5.  The restaurant has a minimalist design with friendly service.  It was a bit hot inside for noodle soup consumption but I can't blame anyone else for my sweats."}
{"text":"Actually I've experienced better chinese style noodle in chinatown. Some dishes like cold potatoes dressed with sauce, beef soup noodle were not bad but the cold noodle with chicken in spicy oil tasted really bad.... My friends and I came there for Thanksgiving day but this meal didn't  make us feel any better. The price was reasonable but there were many other good restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"We were going to Dumpling House on Spadina and happened to see this restaurant on the way so decided to check it out. The restaurant seem newly opened.   The restaurant specialize in Northern Chinese food. I ordered the hand pulled beef noodles with sliced beef. They also have Robot made noodles (with a picture of a robot in the menu - lol). We wondered if the robot actually made the noodles. Looking at the kitchen, we did see the robot but it was not doing anything :(. Anyways none of us ordered the robot noodles.  The food came out fast. The noodles had a good texture to it but soup base was kinda bland and overall meal average."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome handmade fresh noodle dishes. I loved my C1 aka lamb noodles. So good with a little siracha. Service is slow but the noodles are worth it!"}
{"text":"The noodles here are excellent. You can get thin/wide hand cut or robot cut. The pricing is good (less than $10) and the sizes are more than enough.  I got #1 before, the house special, and while the meat was good, the egg is definitely over cooked.   The pork ribs option has a much richer broth than the others, so I'd recommend that.  Lamb skewers are thick and spicy.   Make sure you bring cash (visa above $25).  Place is clean (especially for Chinatown) so overall I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great. It tasted different from your typical Asian soup noodle, especially because Its hand pulled, and made from scratch right before they serve you. The service was okay. I've been craving for noodles lately, so I will come back for more !"}
{"text":"This new place is definitely authentic northwest Chinese cuisine. The price is very reasonable. The environment is very good and waiters are very friendly!  They even have a robot to cut noodles!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Super Noodle Express is a rather intriguing name for this place in Chinatown. If it's meant to attract customers due to its captivating name, well it did its job for me.   There seems to be an increase in these Northern-style noodle places in Chinatown, so I wanted to compare this place to Magic Noodle (similar to how I compared Homemade Ramen to Magic Noodle).  What really caught my attention in this restaurant was the robot sliced noodles. I've had sliced noodles before, but never from some automated machine...so I decided to give it a shot and see if there's any difference from the regular shanxi noodles.  Considering the speed that Chinese restaurants are known for, I will say the food comes out here quite slow compared to other restaurant; I didn't get my food until about 15 minutes after ordering. Wasn't in too big of a rush, but thought I'd bring that up.  As for the food...the noodles were definitely cut perfectly and were long and thick. Magic Noodle's shanxi noodles are also thick, but the length is much shorter. Overall I didn't see too much of a difference, although you would definitely notice the presentation to be more neater. In terms of this meal, I quite like it. The broth was a bit more flavourful than Homemade Ramen, but I didn't give it much thought as it's the noodles that one should be paying attention to in these places.  Service was great for Asian standards; they will ask you beforehand whether you want hot water or tea, and they will make sure you receive your order if it seems you're waiting longer than usual. That's honestly more than you can ask for in these establishments.  I do recommend this place if you're into the whole Northern Chinese stuff. Maybe I'll try their skewers sometime as well."}
{"text":"We stopped here briefly as we strolled through Chinatown for dinner; craving noodles, and as both my gf and I are fans of northern cuisine, we strolled into the restaurant.  We ordered two bowls of robot-cut (dao xiao mian) noodles and a chicken app, the texture of the noodle was chewy and the soup was flavored. I had hoped it had more  vegetable and meat variety, but it was more noodle-heavy. The soup base wasn't too oily, so overall a pleasant food experience!  Since in Chinatown, the decor and service was merely average. But, it was fast service, a clean environment and friendly staff.   The store offered a 10% off promo for adding them on wechat and sharing on Moments,"}
{"text":"Free wifi password is jiajia88888.  Apparently these hand pulled ramen noodles are the new hype - I honestly don't find the dish that special, I prefer Japanese ramen, but it is definitely a lot cleaner and healthier. They also have a number of other traditional Dongbei (Northwest Chinese) dishes such as Dough Drop Soup and Barbecue. I actually really enjoyed the Dough Drop Soup here (first time having it).   Service is pretty standard, dishes came at a reasonable pace, though the Green Onion Pancake we ordered came at the very end, which was strange.   It's also a pretty good option if you just want a fast meal in the area without reservations, as it does not get too crowded and has a good amount of seating (compared to other Chinatown options)."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and when the food was here the noodle were all stocked together~I think it will be better to dine in then take out~the green onion pancake was also not that tasty at all~no flavour and hard to chew~beef was ok tho"}
{"text":"Wow, the noodles are good! (and the portions are huge!)  I got the braised beef brisket with thick-cut noodles, and it was really, really good. The beef is fall-apart tender and both juicy and flavourful the entire way through, and the broth, while a bit salty IMO, was very savoury. The noodles were fresh and chewy just as they should be, and happily never-ending. Seriously, I was still on the noodles 15 minutes in.  I also got the lamb skewers, which I hated because they were crusted with cumin (ugh) and quite fatty. The dried tofu in hot and sour sauce was a bit too oily for my taste, but still good and very well portioned for 2.99.  Definitely worth more visits!"}
