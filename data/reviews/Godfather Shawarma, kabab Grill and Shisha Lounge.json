{"text":"With all chicken meat in the plate half of them are skin. and definitely no flavor for the shawarma. the guy behind the counter use his hand to touch the food and the cash i give to him.. feel bad."}
{"text":"Affordable shisha. Amazing house mix flavour. The owner is very welcoming and gave us great service! The place is laid back and casual. Food can improve, it is bland and need more seasoning."}
{"text":"As an avid shawarma enthusiast this was easily the worst I have ever had and likely the worst meal I have eaten in Toronto since moving here 14 months ago.   I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. The chicken meat was extremely dry (and had a burnt taste), little sauce was used, and no pickled vegetables or potatoes were included with the plate.   Above that the service was extremely slow. My friends and I were the only three customers in the store and it took 15 minutes for the man behind the counter to fulfill our orders. He insisted on doing each one separately and having each person pay before beginning the next meal .   I can only recommend you walk the extra 5-10 minutes North on Yonge to M'Zaar which makes a meal 10x the quality for the same price."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is pure evil and a thief.  He was hired to cater for an evening and had provided a nice sample as a preview, but what he delivered was so bad and such small quantity that it wasn't even worth to serve to beggars. When we complained about it, he accused us of having bad manners before apologising.  This guy will hopefully not be in business for long."}
{"text":"I went to Godfather lounge  with my friends on a Friday night for a dinner and some Shisha and a cup of Arabic coffee.   From only the look the food didn't appeal to us, so we didn't even bother to order anything to eat.   The service was bad! Although, we were the only group there it took them 20 min to only prepare 4 hookahs and two cups of coffee.   There was only one person on the floor, he didn't even write down our orders, so he forgot and mixed them, and didn't even remember any!  The hookah flavors' were bad and tasted old. Also, the coffee tastes like coffee wash but nothing like Arabic coffee. T Let alone telling us the price per hookah was $10 then when we got there and ordered our hookahs we were charged $20!!  The manager has the worst attitude for a manager! when we asked him for the wifi password he didn't want to give it to us, instead he asked to enter it himself on our devices! Like who does that!   Absolutely wasn't a night anyone would expect to have on a Friday night! I won't recommend this place for even a cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Not only the Shisha is excellent and the staff are so welcoming and friendly but also the food is the best I've ever had. I had a Shawarma poutine it was amazing so different and delicious then I had a house mix shisha it was very good. Oh and the shisha was only 10 dollars...definitely going there every night now on"}
{"text":"Very welcoming, went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and make sure we enjoyed our shisha"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for food as most of the restaurants nearby were closed late Sunday. I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich but because the had run out of Chicken  (because it there was Pride parade earlier that day), the usual chicken from Kabob skewers to make my shawarma. The food was good. The place is a bit run down inside because they were doing some construction. This place also sells sheesha and the asked us if we want to try but we declined."}
