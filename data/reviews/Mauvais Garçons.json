{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we discovered this new gem in town. The decor was fine but the staff was lovely. But what shines the most about this place is the food. It's a tapas (small plates) concept but it was great to try several items on the menu. I personally wish the foie gras dish was a slight bigger portion but overall it was amazing. I would totally recommend this place and my favourite was the sliders. A must try!"}
{"text":"Love this tapas place!! Everything we had was fantastic, from our cocktails to our meal to our service. The fried chicken sliders were out of this world... I've never had chicken so crispy. A definite must"}
{"text":"Great little find in griffintown, great place at affordable prices quality of food is awesome, great friendly staff, it's awesome place to go and share tapas . Don't hesitate."}
{"text":"What a pretty restaurant! Ordered a passion fruit old fashion, was done perfectly. Had the fries and the beef tartare. The fries were really good but I was really impressed with the tartar! It was more than a generous size, and it was the perfect amount of mustard. Seasoned very well. The music was a tad loud. Otherwise, great experience, will be going back again."}
{"text":"Underrated in the game. A hidden gem and a great experience. Loved the tapas, highly recommend the cauliflower tacos and the beets 3 ways. 10/10 experience with a great deal. Purchase 1 drink and it's bogo on the tapas - can't beat it !"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Mauvais Garcons so I decided to go down to griffintown to check it out. I wasn't disappointed. Service was happy and friendly and Jason one of the owners made sure that we were well taken care of. The food was exceptionally good. We ordered quite a few things from the menu and then we shared everything. Seems to be the best way to go there. I definitely recommend the place to all my friends and family. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Usually I am excited for Tapas, and it's right beside Le Fantôme, which is an amazing Tapas resto. When I entered, no one was in the front to receive me, I had to go to counter, where all the workers were chitchatting, so I named my reservation, and then they directed me by pointing to the table(when I am used to the host to take us to the table). I order a glass of wine and two Tapas. My smoked salmon was good but the bread with dill/cheese felt more groceries style. My sirloin steak wasn't hot enough. Then I asked for the bill because I had to leave, but it took so long because they were preparing bills for the rest of the group(some of them still waiting for desert). The music was way too loud for a small place. Food 2 1/2 stars, service 0 star..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with lovely workers. They have happy hour $1 oysters from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 pm with a purchase of a cocktail, wine or beer. I also ordered fried chicken sliders, tuna tataki tacos, tuffle oil French fries. The food was spot on and will definitely come back again!   It is in a quite neighbourhood, away from noisy areas. Great restaurant.  #mtl #mtlfoodie #montrealfoodie #mtlfood"}
{"text":"The place was discovered after we took a walk nearby the canal LaChine. We ordered 7dishes and 2 desserts. The tuna and fried chicken burgers are delicious. Apart of that, we find the service was pretty slow. We waiting till midnight for waitress to come to hand to us our bills.  This restaurant is too pricey of its food quality. I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Bof. C'est le mot qui décrit le mieux mon expérience aux Mauvais Garçons. Bof à la nourriture. Bof au décor.   L'idée d'avoir un menu de tapas a partager est bonne. Par contre, les plats n'ont vraiment rien d'extraordinaire. Surtout pas pour le prix. C'était correct. Sans plus.  Pour ce qui en est du décor, quelqu'un devrait partager le conseil suivant à leur désigner intérieur. La couleur brun sur les tables, les banquettes, les chaises, les assiettes, les miroirs et les murs c'est pas à la mode (voir même TRÈS laid)."}
{"text":"I came across a couple of articles during the last few weeks mentioning Mauvais Garçons therefore when my friends proposed to go and try it I was immediately down. The restaurant is located on William St in Griffintown and has this industrial and baroque touch that is really nice. The concept of the restaurant is sharing which is not my favorite, however we ordered 8-10 items from the menu and most of them were really good. I would specially recommend the Mac N Cheese, Lobster Cakes, NY Sirloin and the fried Ferrero Rocher for deserts. The service was really good, one of the owners regularly came to check on us and decided to offer us an item that we chose but did not really enjoy. It was a very good and interesting experience, I will definitely be back as they're planning on adding a Brunch Service."}
{"text":"This restaurant for me started off so strong! Even though it was dead I figured its OK because it's a Tuesday night and the restaurant was very cute. Plus we got good service and it probably helped that it was just my bf and I and a table of 13 people. I ordered mostly what the waitress recommended except the cauliflower taco because I felt that would not satisfy me. Apparently both tacos especially the cauliflower taco is very good. Maybe when I go back I will try it. So I ordered the MG  bloody caesar which consisted of Jameson and pickle juice. It was so good! Perfect mix of spicy and tangy. The waitress informed us that they have $1 oysters so we got 6 of them from Vancouver and 6 from PEI. Then we ordered the fried chicken sliders and a side of fries. I wasn't excited about the chicken and really only got it because of the waitress but damn that was my favorite thing of the night!  Imagine if a McDonald's burger and KFC had a baby. The chicken because of the buttermilk was so juicy and it was hot and steaming and crunchy. There were also arugula and pickles in the sliders too but no ones cares about that. Lol It was pretty filling. Honestly I would have been happy with just the sliders and fries. The fries were made with Parmesan, parsley and truffles.  My bf said it was the best fries he ever had. I would go so far as to say that but they were good. We also ordered the steak sirloin cut in tiny slices with chimichurri and crispy leeks on top. It was good but it didn't blow my mind. Some pieces were more chewy than others. I liked the fatty pieces the best.  We had the mac and cheese with lobster and pork belly. I had high hopes for this one. The waitress recommended it and I like mac and cheese and lobster and pork belly so this dish had to be a winner!! What's not to like?!  Sadly it didn't meet my expectations. I wish the lobster and pork belly pieces had been bigger. They really chopped it up so finely! Had there been more lobster and pork belly it might have made a difference. But that was the least of my problems. My problem was the pasta itself. Some people like it al dente ... but me I'm used to having my mac and cheese more cooked. My bf and I felt it was undercooked for our taste. I'm sure some people like it this way though.  Also the mac and cheese pasta was long!! It wasn't  the typical macaroni pasta. Lastly for dessert we had the deep fried ferrero rocher. There was three chocolates deep fried with vanilla ice cream on the side. To me it tasted like a regular ferrero rocher. You barely taste the batter. It's was good though. Not too sweet. The ice cream had a different texture. I wonder if it was homemade because it was icy and kinda chunky. Haha that's sounds gross but I assure you it wasnt. I hope this place gets more customers because it has a lot of potential! I would come back to try the other things on the menu like the foie gras. Oh  and I would definitely go back for the fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. All the dishes were mediocre and overpriced (despite the restaurant's moderate - rather than expensive - pricing). I have no plans to repeat even though it may be the closest restaurant (in the universe) to my home.  The dishes: - Caesar salad: Ok, but typical. Seemed promising as it was advertised as  coming with pork belly. It turns out that their vision/definition of pork belly (or, at least, its acceptable set of preparations) differs from mine - theirs was prepared thin and crispy like a fried prosciutto. I honestly couldn't get my taste buds to believe it was pork belly. - Lobster fritters: Not again. They essentially took a good ingredient and bumped it DOWN several notches. - Beef sliders: The ratio of beef patty to other components was far too small (I'd have even preferred shrinking the other components - a case of less is more). The quality of the beef seemed low as well (not fast food low - but below the benchmark set by almost any restaurant serving ~$6 sliders - not burgers - that I've experienced). - Fried chicken: Given the option between KFC and this, I would choose KFC every single time. - Fries: Pretty good. My favourite item by far.  The decor and service: - The tables and chairs seem off for this type of restaurant. They're skimpy and wobbly - like what you'd expect in a small neighbourhood Cafe. Coincidentally, the prior tenant in this space was a small neighbourhood Cafe. The other decor elements were somewhere between reasonable and fine. - The service was friendly and added to the experience. I have no complaints about this."}
