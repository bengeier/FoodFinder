{"text":"Masa Sushi gives you the miso soup, salad, and desert as a complementary! Food is super delicious and have variety combos in a good deal. Service is great and they open until late night so you should not be rushed to enjoy drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"Masa Sushi is amazing!  The service is wonderful. The popcorn lobster is the best & they are always so friendly! I highly recommend Masa Sushi over here on Elliot road in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Called them at before their closing time to order for pick up.  I guess they decide when the close because it wasn't 10pm and that's when they say they close on Saturday night....after 22 take out orders from this new location since they opened I guess they will be losing my business now.  Masa....when are you open and closed???  When you decide...put it on your website so people can order food when your open."}
{"text":"They have a very friendly staff, abundant choices (half & half, and combo plates for variety are nice), they're reasonably priced considering the quantity (special rolls are huge!), but most importantly, provide excellent quality sushi.  They start you out with a bowl of Miso soup and a salad (just lettuce with tasty dressing).  Then at the end, you get a fruit dish for the table to share.  Both were very nice surprises.  My wife and I will definitely be going back very soon."}
{"text":"It is our first time and we had such a pleasant experience. they have a huge selection of sushi at a very reasonable price as well. They offer half and half specialty sushi rolls which is great if you want to try different rolls! Their staff is super friendly. The atmosphere is great! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I would love to go back here.  They have the lunch bento combo, they are the best price and best quality I have ever had. They also serve miso soup and salad for free and there is a cute dessert at the end for free as well. Awesome sushi place!"}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good. Stopped in on a Monday evening for a sushi & sashimi boat and a spider roll; the price was a bit on the high side, but portions were very generous and the quality and service was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Masa one Friday night to have dinner.  The place was completely dead. Which was surprising for a Friday evening at dinner time.    We ordered a few rolls and some beer and sake. The rolls were subpar at best, and looked mediocre. I think we were pretty lucky that most of the rolls we picked were cooked as the fish was NOT fresh at all. Later that evening my husband had excruciating stomach pains. Long story short, we both got e-coil from this place, he worse than I (I'm assuming because he ate the spicy tuna roll and I didn't). He had to be put on antibiotics it was so bad.  Needless to  say, we will not be returning ever again. I'm not risking our health again."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check this place out after driving past it many times. It was completely empty when I walked in. That should've been the first sign. It seemed like it had really good deals for happy hour but now I understand why. The sushi was lackluster, the yellowtail was dry, tough, and seemed old. The mussels, I was only able to stomach down one. If you're going to spend any amount of money I suggest driving down the street about five or 6 miles to Mikado. It is much better.  To say the least. Definitely will not be going back here to eat sushi anytime soon."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, I decided to go straight after work and check this place out myself.Nothing special on the outside.( no outdoor seating). Inside was spacious .There was more than enough seating. I had the place to myself (Friday 3:30pm) I was pleasantly surprised at the affordability and by the wide selection of sushi combinations. I was very happy with all my selections. My server was very attentive and the music wasn't bad either. I will definitely be revisiting this place in the near future.   It won't be long before this little secret is out."}
{"text":"Love this place and I am very critical of restaurants. I was really surprised by it. Good food. Inexpensive. Instant favorite."}
{"text":"Best sushi we have eaten in a long time and the service was fast and excellent.  The AZ caterpillar was awesome.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to the Elliot location last night with some friends and all the food was horrendous. Extremely old fish. I got a spicy rainbow roll and the spicy tuna on the inside of the roll was brown and mushy--it was the texture of small roe. I don't recommend this place to anyone. There is why better sushi in the valley. I didn't even eat the dessert, the apples were old and brown too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  There are so many places in my valley to get sushi but this is by far my favorite! Some of the best specials around and TONS of variety. I have my favorite, the maki maki roll but I've also never had anything i didn't like.  Great spot for birthday celebrations, date night or even a quiet night by yourself.   Never ever disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service a true gem of flavor, quality and price. The decor is fitting and the way the waitress says \"enjoy\" when your dish arrives is as alluring as the food. The desert is a simple orange slice with whipped cream and chocolate stick yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in town. I live about 2 miles away, but I prefer this location to the other as it is more convenient for me. The sushi is always well prepared and of high quality. Prices are very reasonable. I always get the ichiban combo (sushi, sashimi, and a rainbow roll) and a cold sake. Their hospitality is extremely welcoming. Whether I dine in or take out it's always a great place. Please take your friends and enjoy some cheap sake bombs! Only $6.50!"}
{"text":"I purchased the Beef Teri + spicy tuna roll for lunch it was awesome great taste very well prepared and of course for the right price. Definitely enjoy going to masa since I first discovered their other location in Gilbert which is close to home and now this new place is near my work place real people fantastic food."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean. Customer service was great. Prices are very reasonable.  So many choices. Food/Sushi is phenomenal! I had the Red Dragon roll that was YUM! And...definitely try the seaweed salad. This will be a regular sushi place we go to. So glad they opened a good sushi restaurant close to us! Next time I'll take pics.;)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Not too pricey and all the courses - salad, soup, and dessert included in the meal. The waiters were very responsive."}
{"text":"This place is decent. It's slightly above the typical sushi restaurant you run into in the valley.   It is happy hour here all the time so basically you can get some cheap rolls of you're in the mood.  The sashimi is pretty decent too.   The decor is cool with all the Polaroid pictures.   I'd like to give this place 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new place close to home and support A small business   And we love our sushi!!     We have been here two times.   First time was ok.  Second time def Not that impressed.  The rolls really weren't fantastic.   I ordered one in particular was not appetizing.  And it was one of the more expensive. I ate a few and told my husband I just can't eat it.  I tried to eat it all but couldn't stomach it.   It's was too soggy and the salmon was too overpowering ( and I love salmon).    So he told me to return it and ask for a refund or ask for something else.     I was told they wouldn't refund anything as I ate most of it.  I ate about half of it.  My husband even tried a piece.   I was ok even getting half of the cost back if they wanted to be stingy.   Nothing.     Then I asked just for an exchange for something else.  I just wasn't ok wasting any bit of  $14.   Even something else half the cost I would have been ok with .  By this time The chef was visibly pissed.  So the server came back with money that the chef gave her.     While I was excited to find a new neighborhood mom and pop place over the large corporations - we won't be back.  We would have been refunded no problem at a RA or Kona.  Just one perk of the larger places  I guess.  I miss our Ichi Ban.  Loved their sushi and happy hour."}
{"text":"It didn't start well - we were served miso soup which was salty and uninspired as well as the usual \"salad\" consisting of iceberg lettuce, a few shreds of carrot, and dressing.  It took a while to get our order and the food was not brought together - my sushi was brought well before my wife's noodles.  It got better after that.  The nigiri was very good - especially the mackerel.  My wife really liked her noodle dish.  It ended with the free desert for us to share that was beautiful to look at and delicious as well.  It consisted of apple slices covered in honey, orange slices with whipped cream, and those chocolate covered sticks.  The seating was comfortable and the noise level was quiet to average.  If we come back it will be on the strength of the main dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place! We used to go to the Gilbert location which is great as well, but there is something about this place that is just fantastic. We have been going there since it opened, the first week we went there 3 times and took a pic and put it on the wall all 3 times, as my girlfriend calls it the \"hat trick\". We have never had a bad experience here and even went it might have been one, the staff did everything to make it right.   I am a big fan of the sashimi appetizer and I like the roll combos they offer, you can get 2 similar rolls as one, which is great, you get to have 2 different rolls and not have to get 2 full rolls. We always try and  get something new when we go. My suggestion is go and try something, I know what i like when it comes to sushi and they have it.  I also enjoy that they offer so much more than just the sushi and rolls. I highly suggest this place, one of my favorite sushi places in the valley!"}
{"text":". Great, pretty looking atmosphere. Food looks very good. Happy hour prices are affordable and worth. The server was nice and pretty fast in asking us for what to order. Environment suits the cuisine of the place. Reasonable prices. I've been here before and their deep fry sushi is really good."}
{"text":"Got my food and saw a live sewer roach moving around on my sushi plate. I GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE IN A BIG HURRY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their sushi is good with great prices.  Staff is very nice.  Definitely order the money balls while you are there.  They do not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've tried their lunch bento boxes, sometimes you get a bit of that fishy flavor, but sometimes you don't - still a really good deal and I love the assortment of options. I love that it comes with a delicious desert after each meal. It's never been super packed when I go, which I love as well. Definitely would recommend anyone to check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for good sushi and are having a hard time deciding on what roll to get, this place is where you should go! It's always happy hour and they have awesome combo specials to choose from. They only serve wine, beer and saki. No full bar, but I was there for the sushi so that was not an issue for me.  The combo specials are 2 different rolls for the price of one. They even have combos that include negiri and sashimi or even sake bombers! To start off your meal when you get seated they bring you complementary miso soup and a lettuce salad. After your entree, they bring you a complementary dessert which is usually a sliced orange and apple with caramel sauce and whipped cream and a poky stick. Nice and light and refreshing to wrap up the well rounded meal! Prices are great! The servers are very helpful and friendly, and before you leave, make sure to get your picture taken to be added to their wall! It's a cool little place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They serve you soup and salad before and a cute orange cream dessert after! The service is always on point and I think it might still be a hidden treasure because I've yet to see it over crowded in there... Prices and menu structure are great and location is easy to get to with ample parking."}
{"text":"Strobe lights and music outside upon arrival of the restaurant. That's a first! Happy and greeting staff when we first walked in the restaurant. Menus are colorful and loaded with pictures for each dish! Great job!   Miso soup and salad was provided prior to ordering! Awesome! Shared special combo 2 plate: #6 Palm Springs which included salmon rock 2 pieces (salmon with thinly sliced cooked onions and a yogurt sauce of some sort) spicy tuna roll 5 pieces and Fuji roll and eel roll. The eel pieces were a bit burnt as of there were no eel.  Grand opening special: thinly sliced apples with caramel drizzled on too with half orange cut up into chunks with whipped cream and 2 choc pretzel sticks. Yum!   Full at the end of dinner. Not bad!!  They all said goodbye with happy faces! That's how it's done! ;)"}
{"text":"Masa Sushi was typical when it came to their sashimi platter. I wanted them to Wow me, but they succumbed to the usual boring fish! We won't be back."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, we sat at the bar and were handed two different menus both had so much that it was overwhelming. They do offer some great combinations of rolls and specials. The sushi was fresh and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Solid place to enjoy some late night sushi and beer. Never had a bad experience, service is always prompt and the food delicious."}
{"text":"What kind of sushi does Emilia Clarke order? Mother of Dragons roll.  Masa Sushi is the place to go when you want to be overwhelmed with different combinations. They have so many choices that it's hard to choose. This is the place to go when you want options for some basic sushi rolls. You get a miso soup and salad with most of their options. The fish is decent and flavor combinations are usually spot on.  The restaurant lighting is pretty bad and it's a bit dark inside. At least it's a very clean space with a lot of staff. Get a sake bomb to get lit."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Masa and I was thoroughly impressed! They have happy hour going on Monday-Saturday so there's always some type of special going on.   My boyfriend and I ordered a soft shell crab as an appetizer and it was brought out along with complimentary miso soup and a side salad within under 10 minutes of ordering. Talk about fast service!   For the main entree, we ordered the Superman combo which consisted of an eel roll, 2 pieces of salmon rock, an energy roll, and a star roll (shrimp tempura roll topped with avocado and eel // shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon, tuna, and avocado) - all for $19.95! Now that's a good bang for your buck.   The happy hour menu had a bunch of sushi roll combos - not many had combos that I would prefer but I would definitely come back to this restaurant to try some different rolls or even reorder what I had tonight."}
{"text":"Tried here a week ago for first time. Subin was our server and she treat us as vip. Owners are good too come check our table and ask hows everything. Foods are decent and huge menu. Oh! They open late! Over all, I will be back here"}
{"text":"Must get the sushi combo! The sushi portions are generous and the price is right. I ordered the Maki Roll combo. It came with tempura, many types of sushi, salad and miso soup. The menu has a lot pictures! It was confusing at first because I wanted to order different types sushi that I am not able to consume. The visual pictures was helpful to see what the dishes and sushi looks like. Also the service is good and fast. Make sure to dine here hungry!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Masa. The sushi was good. I loved the \"happy hour\" menu and that it was defintely affordable. A lot of different options on it which was perfect. I also loved the fact they decorate with Polaroid pics of customers. Gives it a feel that it's a place a lot of people like to go to celebrate. My only complaint was the service. The waitress wasn't especially friendly or sociable. Although, we did go in about an hour before they closed. So maybe she was just ready to go home. But that doesn't stop me from going back. I'll defintely be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times at varying hours and I have always been pleased with the food and service. They have a permanent happy hour menu that's very reasonably priced. The salmon and tuna rolls are made with large pieces of meat which I feel is a great value for what they charge. You will be impressed with all the extras they provide with whatever you order (free miso soup, small salad, and desert). These people deserve 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Just had a very late dinner here and their sushi was so good!  I've been here a few times and always enjoy their sushi and quiet atmosphere.  And it's even better that they were open until 12am when we just couldn't settle for anything other than quality sushi at 9:00 P.M.!  Our server was prompt, sweet, and just as enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"So I'm a true born and raised Californian so my caliber for sushi is pretty high. Finding an awesome sushi place in a city that isn't close to water is a little sketch, but hey. Cravings are meant to be satisfied somehow.   Masa is my family's favorite spot because:  1) miso soup and salad with sesame ginger dressing is served to all 2) the pieces of sashimi are generously cut  3) there is always a \"happy hour\"  4) they serve a cute dessert of thinly sliced apples, pocky, oranges and whipped cream  When it comes to real sashimi and sushi options, it is a little limited (no ikura or uni) but that's understanding based on location. This is more of a spot for satisfying sushi roll and bento box cravings! And of course sake bombs :)  Before you leave, ask if you and your table can take a Polaroid and post it! Make the trip memorable!  P.s. Try the monkey balls and sashimi salad!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been here twice because the food was so amazing!  It was presented beautifully and the service was great.  I had California? Rolls, Jalipina stuff, another kind of roll with crunchy? bits on top with something delicious and Japanese beer.  It was so good and I can't wait to go back.  Thank you, ?Masa Sushi for?? such a great meal.  I was the lady who came by herself and sat in the corner at the left table. I will be back."}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant at least every other week. We love the vibes. Service is great and the menu is amazing!! Great prices too."}
{"text":"Finally I found a place for sushi!!! It was really sweet of them to serve salads and miso soups for free and dessert as well:) The restaurant was not too busy, so we could get good services! I had a salmon love roll and my friend had a beef udon. Both were delicious! Salmon was really fresh and my friend said the soup was super good too! I will see you guys soon masa! And thanks for the Polaroid photo:)"}
{"text":"Loved everything that I got last night! I had a Lion King roll, tempura udon(which I wasn't too fond of the big noodles but it was still good), beef fried rice and an appetizer of pot stickers  The overall service was great, the udon came in an awesome looking bowl and the lemon water was delicious. Recommend to anyone looking for a nice, tucked away location that isn't too busy."}
{"text":"Always fast, fresh, and delicious! Reasonable prices for the quality and portions. This is our #1 go to place when we are craving sushi. A+"}
{"text":"Worst sushi place ever! My vegetable rolls and cucumber rolls tasted horrible. It is the first time ever that I eat vegetable sushi that it is so bad, the vegetables were falling apart all the time. We wanted to try something new and we were very excited about this place. My husband didn't like the sushi either. He said \"I have eaten lots of great sushi at other places\". We are sushi lovers and we can't believe how bad sushi tastes here. We even almost didn't get refills. Unbelievable! He ordered eel sushi. He said his sauce didn't taste as it is supposed to be. He couldn't find good flavor on it.   Their menus doesn't mention the list of ingredients.  When you order, your sushi may have cream cheese on it and other surprise ingredients (we know other places add cream cheese as well).  I only like the patio! They have brooms and even cat's food on their patio. This review is about their Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Not bad... Not bad at all. Great place for less expensive sushi that is open all the time and has great all day happy hour deals!   What I like is that you automatically get miso soup and a salad as a starter freebie.   The rolls are good. Their Nigiri is good too. Nice sake specials and everything.   The ambiance is excellent... Seems like this place will get super busy on the right nights."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at Masa Sushi after enjoying a terrific lunch and I just wanted you to know how enjoyable this experience was.  Great food, terrific service and a great atmosphere to eat at.  Strongly recommend this place if you enjoy sushi, you'll love it here."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Super close to my house and they are very accommodating with recommendations and they try to be with requests as well.  They start you with a salad and miso soup - free. Then after the meal they will bring you a very simple but delish complimentary dessert as well.!  Masa has wonderful service, they should be very proud of their staff. I have been here several times and they are very consistent.   The only thing i dislike is the vast array of selections.... I get confused by them easily. lol AND they do not offer an Alaskan Roll. poke...poke... Ya'll should totally add that to your plethora of  offerings!  ;)"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. It had fast service and decent prices! Great date night spot."}
{"text":"Masa had a really nice ambience, the sushi was good, the happy hour is even better and the customer service was exceptional. Every sever was quick to help and gave recommendations. It was a great date night meal for my girlfriend and I."}
{"text":"Very mellow place, on a monday. The sushi was delivered exceptionally fast as well as the miso soup. A little less miso than i was expecting. But the service was attentive and very kind. Food was above average in quality. I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Great place. Wast sent here by Yelp and wasn't disappointed. Had the lunch mini-bento and was full and satisfied. GOOD STUFF. Very affordable by the way. Oh, and the service was exceptional. :)"}
{"text":"Masa Sushi is amazing! My boyfreind and i have been comeing here for almost 3 year! At one point we were coming once a week! I think its safe to say were addicted! Masa is definetly our go to resturant!"}
{"text":"So the menu is a little complicated, but they have some really good combo deals and for whatever you need you can simply ask. I will definitely be back to dine again.   All fish was prepared well and at proper temperature. The miso soup and salad, and orange and apple desert were great additions to the meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  For some odd reason I like pictures of sushi, it takes out a lot of the guessing what Im ordering half the time. I love all the combo's as well. I ordered one of their boxes last time, and the beef was outstanding!!  The dessert they serve at the end is AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Masa sushi is THE BEST. It's our go to spot. Food is top notch, the ambiance is super modern and cool (great music), and to top it all off the service is always always exceptional.  It's hard to find a place that is consistent with both food and service. We've been coming here for four years and every time we come we leave happy and still have money in our pockets!  Go, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Superb service and the most creative dessert we have seen at a sushi restaurant (:"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi joint! Great selections, not just your every day boring California roll. Authentic environment, really cool staff. The only downer is they don't open till 5pm. But they're open till midnight! 2 thumbs up! I'd give more but I only have 2 thumbs to give."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been in Chandler for a few weeks now and have been looking for a sushi place. I have to admit, I'm a huge sushi snob and would normally be freaked out by a sushi restaurant in a strip mall...but this place is incredible. I'm so pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge and the rolls were so fresh and delicious. Our new spot for sure!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. The prices are fantastic. If your in a discovery mood and want to try different things, check out their happy hour and combo deals. You can get half of one roll and half of another. I started with the sake bomb combo C and ordered a half arizona:half spicy roll. Delicious. The fish is fresh, no fishy taste. Gonna go back and try sashimi next. I'll let you guys know how it goes. Definitely worth going... Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Having been stationed in Japan for two years, I adore the country, the people and the food and drink. Masa is really fantastic and takes me back. They have a really fun menu with a ton of creative inventions along with the traditional favorites.   Two words for you: Boston roll. Rolls topped with  lobster, some kind of magical voodoo sauce and melted cheese. I know it sounds crazy, but you won't regret doing this!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time last night. They have a great happy hour that goes till 10pm. There were so many menu choices that is was hard to decide but we went with the sashimi dinner for two. Never had such a great price for all that we got and the quality was great. We sat at the sushi bar which I recommend! The owner made our sushi and was so nice. Excited to go back and try some of their rolls."}
{"text":"This is our new sushi spot. No matter what we order the food is delicious. I describe the place as sort of a sports bar, no frills but great deals. The happy hour menu offers 2 half rolls so you can get more variety. If you don't know if you like sushi, or you don't like raw fish, not to worry! There are other cooked choices as well. You get a complimentary bowl of miso soup and a salad, and finish the meal with a cute little dessert with sliced apples with caramel. We've tried many sushi places in the valley and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"So, Masa Sushi was really good!   Started with a pleasant miso soup and a salad. Tasty soup, basic salad.  Had the Tuna Tataki served with shredded Daikon, the tuna was soooo fresh and clean. Was great with a little wasabi and soy.  The tempura platter - scallops, Cali roll, shredded veggie thing.  All really tasty. Warning, they dot everything with a bit of Sriracha so if spicy isn't your thing...  Spouse enjoyed her Philadelphia roll and a bowl of Udon.  Very pleasant staff, good food, reasonable prices, all around enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Service and food was pretty good! I came in on a Saturday around 5 with a party of 4, it wasnt packed so that was convenient.  My order: Ninja combo $26.95 Tuna + salmon combo $7.00 Las Vegas roll $11.95 Caterpillar roll $10.95 Beef yakisoba $11.95  The food was amazing! I wasn't able to take any pictures since I was too excited...... the place was very chill I liked how quiet it was. I definitely recommend this place. I would say this place was overall a 7/10."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strip mall. It looks like your typical sushi joint with a photo menu on the outside of the building. Inside they have Polaroid photos throughout the restaurant of birthday celebrations, which is a bit tacky. It has a standard Japanese theme and a sushi bar in the back.  The service was pretty good and fairly prompt for lunch. The lunch specials are a really good deal.  We started with the fried mushrooms stuffed with cream cheese. They were really good and not overly greasy.   I had the tuna and salmon rolls. Each were 8 pieces and the fish was fresh. The rice was well cooked. Overall, some good sushi, especially for the price."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and we love it! The miso soup and salad are a great touch and the sushi combinations are amazing! I don't eat a full roll so it's so nice how they have half and half options.The food comes out super quick. The staff is super friendly and attentive and the polaroid they take is so fun! My kid had never seen a polaroid before so thank you for bringing that experience to our family! We will be back, a LOT!"}
{"text":"I love everything here. I usually get the spicy chirashi and udon for my kids. It's so good. My kids love the udon. The service is always good and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Been there twice in the past three days, and I'm planning to go again today.  GREAT variety of sushi and the service is second to none.  Some of freshest sushi I've have in AZ.   Sake Bombs and Spicy Tuna Bitches!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I would not say that it is the best I have had, but it wasn't bad.   Staff was friendly and very knowledgable. Personally, the quality and flavor was not worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"Walk in the door within seconds we had miso soup and salads sitting in front of us! On the house starters! Can't beat that! The sushi was good but not the best I've ever had which I didn't expect. Service was quick and friendly! Oh and to finish it off they give you a free dessert! My new local sushi spot for now on!"}
{"text":"The sushi is very good sushi for the money and the prices at the happy hour are excellent.  They also give you a bowl of miso soup and a small salad as a starter before your sushi. This is a very nice touch.  The green tea iced tea is excellent and really hits the spot to top off a very nice inexpensive sushi meal.  They also offer excellent happy hour specials on sake bombers too.  For dessert they also bring you a free sliced apple with whip cream and caramel sauce.  Very nice."}
{"text":"So first off let me say that I am absolutely 110% excited that they opened a second location over by my condo and was so excited to get my butt in there to see how they do compared to the original location.  Unfortunately I was craving them the other night and decided to get take out to bring home. So they got my food ready quick and I could have swore the salmon combo was supposed to come with 5-6 pieces of sashimi. Mine came with 3 not that big of a deal really so its okay.  The only thing that bummed me out to the extreme was that when I had already gotten home and was all over diving into my food then the unthinkable happened!!  NO WASABI OR GINGER!!!!  Both of those two things are extremely crucial in my sushi binging.  I cannot tell you how upset I was last night going home to realize I did not have the essentials to eat my sushi.  Im upset even just thinking of it last night.  Its not like wasabi and ginger are readily available at the grocery store to buy in bulk.  So I would have to go out of my way to go all the way back to get wasabi and ginger when normally it's included. That is my only pet peeve at the moment. And hoping that it won't happen again and I'm hoping to god the one waitress from the other location didn't follow because it's very annoying having someone constantly asking if you need anything or if you are done etc etc.  Update! *5/9/2014 All week I've been craving more salmon-sashimi and rolls all together non stop. Finally Friday comes along and it's sushi after work for sure! I call it in to pick it up and this time saying extra wasabi and ginger. They give me the right amount of sashimi finally and everything looked amazing! Couldn't wait this time to go crazy! I ordered the same thing again obviously except this time with you know the ginger and wasabi they didn't give me last time. They gave me so much wasabi I wasn't expecting and not so much ginger. I'd rather have them skimp on wasabi over ginger. But that's just me! Once I start going in they will remember for sure.  I absolutely love ginger with my sushi.  The salmon tasted fresh and I ate a lot of it in less than probably 30 minutes to an hour it was so good!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, food, and environment.  I would welcome all of my friends and family to try this place out! It's so amazing! Thank you for the great food and experience !"}
{"text":"Been here a few times love it! Great food reasonable prices you can't go wrong and very prompt service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Masa. Been to the Gilbert and chandler locations many times and they never disappoint. Sushi rolls have a great combination of flavors .. Many rolls have fish/veggies inside and outside the actual roll. You can't beat the quality, taste, and price. The staff is very attentive and you even get to enjoy a complimentary dessert that is light and a very pretty actually :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is what really brings me back. It's across town for me, but it's worth it whenever I have time. I've never enjoyed such awesome specials as their sake bomb specials and the staff is always on point. It's not always that I give something five stars, but this place is really worth it and I'm excited to drop in late one night for the night crowd."}
{"text":"The Boston roll is pretty good. I felt like most of the rolls here are some variation of California rolls with a different topping. Kind of boring. Price is reasonable, they have lots of happy hour options. They also do half/half rolls, which is cool because you can try more items. Everyone enjoyed the complimentary salad and miso soup."}
{"text":"Great little hidden place. I usually go to the location off of Guadalupe, but this location is the new close one for me with the recent move.  I went around 1pm on a Monday and it was dead! Not sure, why...because the food was great! There was only one other table inside being served. Appetizers and entrees are great! Price is even better, which is a biggie for a cheap guy like myself.   Literally the best place to get you're sushi fix.  Fav Rolls: Caterpillar, crunch, and California tempura.  The monkeys rolls make a great appetizer! I'll be back to this spot for sure!"}
{"text":"One can not go wrong here for the best value variety for sushi & Japanese cuisine and drinks. With their happy hour & reverse happy hour, there's something for everyone's budget and pallet. They're open late & have an inviting atmosphere that makes one want to return and it did for me."}
{"text":"Extremely average sushi. Marginally better than a buffet. The pieces of fish were average, most of the rolls are fried or over sauced which is not authentic and a way lots of sushi restaurants hide poorer quality or fish they will have to throw out soon. Don't know if that's the case here but always makes me suspicious. Also the restaurant has Essentially zero atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Sushi places, and this is one of the best. Great service, great food, and great prices!! I'm going back again and again. I'm so glad this opened in my neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Nice staff, clean, fun space and great footy. They have a great lunch menu and great happy hour. My favorite local sushi place."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations many times. This is my go-to sushi restaurant and a weekly addiction. The food here is always well prepared and delicious. I love the free salad, soup, and desert. No one else does that. The value and quality of the sushi can't be beat by anyone!"}
{"text":"Valentine's night, you'd figure that a restaurant would be staffed and ready to rock, right? Came in and the place was only half filled (that should've been the first sign), with 5 people working the entire restaurant. There was an hour wait for 4 rolls and an entree. Seriously? Pass...."}
{"text":"I finally tried out Masa this week and was very pleasantly surprised. The service was extremely prompt and cordial, the price more than reasonable (their specials are worth checking out!) and the specialty roll I ordered was of very high quality. I can tell this will be one of my regular dining choices. I'd recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a quality sushi fix."}
{"text":"Plus:  - Good quality Salmon - Decent Prices - Interesting dessert @ the end.  Negative: - Service  Came in at 8:30pm, their sign says closes at 9pm.  Felt rushed the whole time.  They came around @ 8:40 and told me last call for any orders of sushi.  Mind you I have been only ordering Sashimi which takes about 8 seconds to cut up.  They had the closed sign by 8:55pm.  I completely understand wanting to get out on time but when I'm spending $20-$40 on one meal I feel like I should be valued and not rushed.    Also had a weird experience with the sushi chef more interested in the basketball game than in his own customers.  When challenged to see what his suggestions on what is a great fish to grab for the day he said all of them are good.  To me that shows a lack of interest in your product that you are offering.  By no means should you not visit this establishment as it may have been an off night for them and their salmon was on point but I personally will not attend again considering the options I have."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time a couple days ago. Usually got to the Gilbert location. Saturday afternoon and the place was empty. Sushi was bomb. Saki was great. A little bit too quiet for me but service was great."}
{"text":"I have been going to masa for years when this location opened i was excited since it was closer to home. Went there last night to find there are turning it into more of a bar and late night place to eat. They seemed to get rid of their happy hour prices and things are getting more expensive.  They added a new menu but 15 for kim chee fried rice is a bit bunch when the portion is small"}
{"text":"When I first noticed this sushi restruant had move into my neighborhood I was a little scepticle. Been traveling to Sushken in Awatuki for years. I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and diletable food. Great sushi is now only a few blocks from home now."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best Sushi places I have ever been to. I just moved here from Florida and am amazed how delicious it was, Between my partners plate and mine I tried 5 different rolls and all were excellent!!! Afterward the complementary orange with cream and Carmel drizzle was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Staff was really nice and attentive. Food was delicious and fresh. I definitely be back. and recommend."}
{"text":"We tried this place out after searching for sushi around Chandler, and we were not disappointed. The sushi was some of the best I've had in AZ, and the presentation was great. Awesome little hole-in-the-wall place. The atmosphere is relaxed. We were there during happy hour and the sushi deals were awesome. Fairly affordable and delicious! The hawaiian combo was to die for! Also the Tokyo platter is great."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here wanting to try a new place and we plan to come back! You get free soup and salad with your meal and they gave us a free house dessert. We ordered Mochi ice cream too and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent meal! Start with a salad and soup, then the meal gyoza, sushi combos.. And last they finish with an orange with whip cream, honey, and a pocki cracker! Great value!! Spent $45 between the 2 of us! Much last less than our normal sushi run!!"}
{"text":"For the first time in my life I left a sushi restaurant without eating all my food.  We don't go out to eat sushi too often because of the cost and when we do it's a special treat. We wasted our money tonight.  We sat at a table and were provided with menus, the menu is full of pictures. I read the menu many times and couldn't find nigiri sushi in it. Figured I could just order it and we did.  Note, this restaurant does not or at least did not give us, the slip of paper where you write down what you are ordering, by the time the server came I had forgotten some of the things we wanted to order.  We ordered Gyoza to start, when it came out I was surprised to see some of the wrappers were green. The menu just said they were Japanese Dumplings. Having ordered and made Gyoza many times I was surprised when I realized we got 3 vegetable and 3 pork Gyoza. I would be nice if the menu clarified this, didn't care for the flavor of the vegetable ones and the pork ones were bland, the accompanying ponzu sauce was watered down and did not taste anything like ponzu. Fail.             We also ordered nigiri salmon and that was really good. Great! The rolls we ordered were blah, spicy tuna was sweet and then spicy and was just not good. The lobster roll was a big mistake, not sure why I would even order something like this. Fail on me.  Now, I'd like to take a minute to comment on the service. When our gyoza came out, she asked us in a very condescending tone \"oh you are splitting?\" Well, it's an appetizer, yes we are splitting.  Once the rolls and nigiri were brought out, we didn't see our server again. I had ordered hot tea and was pretty much out and needed a refill. I put my cup at the end of the table and waited until we could see someone to get their attention. Once the server came to our table, she looked at my daughter's half empty coke and told her she would be bringing a refill. I didn't have an opportunity to even ask her for another tea. Now I know servers don't read minds, but if you see someone's cup at the edge of the table it has to mean something. Does this cup need to be cleared, does this persone need more tea? Something!  When she brought the coke I was done eating and just needed for my daughter to finish her food. I was over my need for tea.  We sat and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally we stood up and went to the front  desk and our server finally came. She asked us if the food was ok, we wanted to get out and said yeah. Liars, I know.  She gave me a total, not an itemized bill. Just a total. I could very well have asked for one, but I was tired and had given up on this restaurant. There are things that you shouldn't have to ask for. An itemized bill is one of them. I gave the server my credit card and she gave me the receipts to sign and one to keep, nowhere was the tally of the items i ordered. While I was signing it, it came to me that this would be the first time I was not going to leave a tip. I just couldn't do it. Service and food was crappy. I should have known when we got there at 6:30 pm on a Saturday night and at the most, they had 5 tables."}
{"text":"Best late-night sushi around the Chandler area. Never too busy which makes for a good ambience. They also are always playing the best playlists so you can rave and eat at the same time."}
{"text":"I've been going to Masa Sushi in Gilbert since I was young and I moved to Mesa and this location is JUST as good. The vibes are unique and welcoming. The spicy edamame is a must. The staff is super friendly and greets you with a smile every time they approach your table. Masa Sushi is a must!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant ever! Everything is delicious there and you get so much for your money! They always give you a miso soup, a small salad and even a yummy/cute dessert at the end to enjoy with your meal. Service is always amazing and very personable! I bring all my family and friends here and hope you will too! Sake bombs are a must!!"}
{"text":"This place seemed promising with 4 stars.  They have happy hour all day and decently priced.  However, spicy tuna was very sweet (didnt taste normal) and their raw fish was warm.  It was completely empty with only my husband and I.  Staff was friendly but I'm sorry I can't do warm sashimi."}
{"text":"First time here and we were so impressed. The food was delicious the service was fast and attentive, I have not one bad thing to say. We got 8 different rolls, try the rattlesnake, it was so different, but so good! I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places,  I've been going here since the first Gilbert location opened. I like that they give free soup, salad, and dessert. I like eating raw fish so I find the spicy tuna salad and their special rolls (red dragon etc. ) to be really good.   I am sad to read reviews about people getting sick. I hope that's not the case, and Masa is making changes to assure that doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"I'm local, and live near Masa Sushi & Izakaya. I eat sushi frequently  and find their variety and quality is towards the higher end from my experience. They also have very interesting combos I haven't seen else where that are very satisfying."}
{"text":"I've neglected my duties as a true Masa Sushi fan. I should've written this review sooner to share my love of this sushi destination. My roommates and I have long made special outings to the Gilbert location, because we enjoy the sushi so much. But imagine our anticipation, finding out that a new location was opening up in our neck of the woods... literally a hop, skip, and a jump away!  The things we love about Masa Sushi is how hot Miso soup and a chilled salad are served immediately and are included with any meal. Ditto for the fresh fruit and pocky dessert! The service is warm and inviting, and we are recognized during repeat visits by the hostess and waitress here (although we have yet to make it onto their \"wall\" of Polaroids). We will have to shamelessly ask to be photographed, I suppose, on our next jaunt, but maybe before we stuff our faces with fresh fish goodness. It's a wonder they don't employ Oompah-Loompahs to roll us out after our bouts of fishy gluttony!  Let me save you time on the menu, which is endless and dazzling. You must try the Monkey Balls! More of an appetizer, the Monkey Ball includes warm mushrooms, spicy tuna, and cream cheese on the inside and is deep-fried and drizzled with a special sauce on the outside. In fact, on all of their menu descriptions of their special rolls, a description is always given for what's \"IN\" and what's \"OUT\". This two-layered approach not only makes for great and interesting sushi, but is a novel way to find that perfect combination to satisfy your sushi cravings. My favorite is the Boston Roll (IN - shrimp, crab stick, salmon and avocado; OUT - baby lobster, baked cheese). It may sound funky, but it is delicious! This is a sushi roll that eats like a casserole! I've found that it is best complemented with sriracha (which you must ask for on the side) and soy sauce.  There's plenty more to explore on the menu, but now that I've found my favorites, I'm sticking with them. Newcomers to Masa Sushi are encouraged to find their own favorite \"INs\" and \"OUTs\", because IN-and-OUT is what it's all about!"}
{"text":"Masa Sushi is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix. The sushi is always fresh and the portion sizes are always filling. There's salad and miso soup included with every meal."}
{"text":"Not too shabby at all.   We ordered the Las Vegas roll that was made with Salmon, avocado, crab, cream cheese with eel sauce and added spicy mayo. Bazinga! Delish Delish   The only thing I didn't care for here was the mild smell grease in the air. It makes my head hurt.   The server was very quick doing the damn thang serving multiple tables at a time.   Prices of beer were cheap but note most of them are Japanese beers which is dope because they were good.   I will be back if I'm ever in town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food and awesome service. I loved their complimentary soup & salad. I ordered the salmon bowl and the salmon was perfectly cooked and drizzled with adequate amount of sauce. My friends ordered the Boston roll and the Haru Haru combo and they were also absolutely delicious! At the end of our meal, a server surprised us with a complimentary dessert that consisted of apple, whipped cream, and some pocky sticks. Overall, I would recommend you try this out if you want amazing sushi/cuisine at an amazing price."}
{"text":"Brought a buddy here to do sake bombers for his first time, and eat a bunch of sushi. The experience was even better this time. The wait staff is awesome, and made sure we had a great experience. The food was amazing, and the sake sat well in our stomachs."}
{"text":"Just ok. It's your basic, generic, americanized sushi roll house. The smell of the restaurant is a bit sketchy, but not overwhelming. The cuts of fish are a bit clumsy and their white fish have some of that unpleasant gray cloudiness going on.   Service was friendly & pricing is fair. Menu is trying to cover all the bases of a cliche japanese sushi bar & grill. It's not a bad place, but i was definitely hoping for a bit more."}
{"text":"Aways have great service. The price is right and have the best eel sauce. I love the miso soup and salad served free prior to your meal and the cutest little desert at the end. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the revolving sushi spots. It is SUPER fresh too."}
{"text":"Great sushi place! Wonderful food! Great atmosphere! Loved the decor! Multiple options on the choices for dinner and happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great and quick spot for lunch! Excited to try out their dinner options. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi...the staff is friendly..the prices are good as well with happy hour every day anytime.  The stuffed jalapeños are awesome"}
{"text":"Have dined in a couple times it was pretty decent, though ordered for pickup and was pretty bad :( ordered the yakisoba seafood and beef noodles, super greasy the taste was terrible :( I don't like writing bad reviews though i was upset because I paid 52.76 for takeout that I wish I would have went elsewhere for that kind of money. I would like to call and complain but I just won't go back, if I couldn't get my money back. Oh well live and learn, that's why there's Yelp. I'm not saying all the dishes are bad but yakisoba never never Again!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The food is amazing especially the salmon sashimi. The service was excellent and the waitress was very helpful."}
{"text":"Masa sushi never disappoints. My favorite is the monkey balls and the stuffed jalapeños. Great food, good prices keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Masa Sushi for the longest time.  I've had their Gilbert location bookmarked forever but I never seem to remember about the existence of the place whenever I crave that delicious raw fish.  So when I went to Fry's one day and saw that they were opening one in my neck of the woods, I was ecstatic.  [Fast forward a few months of long agonizing wait time]  One day while getting the mail, I noticed there was a menu flyer on my car for Masa Sushi.  Yes!  So I stopped in that night with my dinner date during opening week last week and was pleasantly surprised by how busy this place was!  Korean was being spoken by the workers, patrons were merrily eating and drinking, and we were seated by the nicest lady ever.  We ended up getting The Superman Combo, Bomb Combo D, and the Yellowtail & Hawaiian half & half rolls.  Everything was fresh and delicious!  I was especially impressed by how thick the slices of sashimi were.  I always hate it when a sushi joint goes stingy with their sashimi.  Buzz kill.  After doing some sake bombs and enjoying our free opening week dessert, we were asked to doodle on a Polaroid the took of us [Asian Glow like whoa], and we were done.  By far the funnest opening week celebration ever.  Plus the bill was 10% off!  Masa Sushi is a tiny cozy restaurant with lots to offer:  Their menu is jam packed with a million different combinations and half & half rolls options, the sake comes hot, and the service is great.  Will definitely come back!  :D"}
{"text":"This place has great sushi for really low prices. The staff is very friendly & on top of service. And the super yummy oranges & apple slices for dessert is heavenly! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yep, their sushi could be good but their service is terrible. Waited at the hostess stand for a good 10-12 minutes and all of the waiters, the bartender, the chef in the kitchen saw us waiting but not a single one of them walked up to us to get us seated. We looked around to make sure it wasn't a seat yourself location and saw a big sign that said 'please wait to be seated'.   They had at least 6 tables empty and maybe they were short staffed but they could have always said ' please wait'. We just awkwardly stood by other people's tables waiting and finally walked out."}
{"text":"Although short staffed ,they manage to put out a fantastic salmon sushimu and california rolls . The green tea is tasty and fresh,the miso soup is about a 7 on 10 scale.  Service was outstanding by the only waitress in the diner.  They were semi- busy with about 15 people dining in. Great pricing for the quallty of food served! We enjoyed seaweed salad, miso soup,ginger side salad, 3 orders of salmon sushimi(5 pieces) 1 california roll and 2 hot green teas all for 33 bux We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times with family friends and have never been let down! This review is long overdue. Sushi is good quality and they have everything made quicker then any other sushi place I've ever been to. Definitely my go to place for sushi! Great happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Nice and clean. On the weekends they open until 2am which is great. Happy hour isn't bad. Wish there were more sushi specials! Will be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not going to write a story because I'm not too happy about this experience, so I'll bullet point it...   -Wife and I ate there Friday night, feeling fine (2nd time here) - Feeling indigestion and not too good through the night - Wife went home Monday from work with stomach issues, feeling under the weather - Tuesday morning I became violently I'll at at trade show in Florida - Thursday, still under the weather, stomach pains and lethargic so went to the doctor, concerned it was an appendicitis - Doctor is convinced it is food poisoning (E.Coli), and puts me on antibiotics  Now I normally don't bash restaurants but this is unacceptable.  We normally go to Sakana's in Ahwatukee where we have been dozens of times with no issues, but did not want to make the trip that night.  This may have been a one-off for this place, but I'm convinced for the sheer fact my wife and I had similar symptoms (mine being much worse) that their prep and service made us ill.  Will not be back again."}
{"text":"The best place to dine in for sushi night!  They have Kirin Sapporo draft beer!  Their Soft shell crab is the best I've ever had It's a great place offering fresh and variety of selection of food for reasonable price  Servers are all very kind and considerate"}
{"text":"I love Masa's I think they have the best sushi in the area. Their Gilbert location is always busy. The Chandler location is not. I kind of want to keep this a secret but they have a ton more space here and the same excellent sushi! It's lunch time and I have the whole place to myself and my lunch with soup and salad $6! Love it!  Update 8/2/14- food is still awesome but the  waitress service was awful. We had to ask for drink refills, we had to ask for my daughter teriyaki that I could see on the counter, we had to ask for our bill. Our waitress who I am guessing was a manager was busy counting her register drawer, then visiting  in the back with a different staff member.  My husband said never again but that would be hard since the sushis so good!"}
{"text":"We got a flyer at our door step and we've decided to give this restaurant a try. This restaurant is very well decorated and the service is great. Their ice green tea is awesome and will definitely order it again. However, the sushi doesn't taste as fresh as I expected. Nevertheless, the prices are very reasonable and I don't mine going back to try something else."}
