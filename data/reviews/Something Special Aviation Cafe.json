{"text":"This lovely spot is a hidden gem inside the Glendale Airport. The food is always delicious and the owners are incredibly accommodating to the locals and their babies/toddlers/kiddos. There's a small play area inside the restaurant and the menu offers baby led weaning food selections. There is so much more to be said about this spot and the people that make it thrive. Check it out and ENJOY."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and had the breakfast burrito. Food was good but the atmosphere for kids was amazing. Play place for the little ones, views of planes taking off and a menu that caters to kids under two that just want to graze and pick at things. Strongly recommend for anyone with children."}
{"text":"I havent got my food yet and I'm already in love with this place. I love how they have a little kid area, So I don't have to worry about him fighting with me for anything he can sit there and play while we wait for the food. I honestly can see myself coming here more and I am going to try there Monday story time. The staff was nice and friendly which I liked."}
{"text":"Cool place for meet ups.  Came here with my boy and our friends. They love watching the planes & playing in the little kid area.  We got a muffin and I had a hot coffee.  The muffin was good, not a fan of the coffee.  I've had the cold brew in the past and it was decent!  The prices are ok, the staff is friendly and attentive. We will come back for another playdate."}
{"text":"Based on great reviews we came on a Thursday at 0800. It is closed. A guy in an office said it is \"closed this week.\" So much for advertised hours on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great for Moms and Little ones! Had a baby play date here this morning with my 10 month old and he had a blast! Not only do they have a BLW menu for only $2.50 but they also have a fun play area for the little ones and nice clean high chairs! Service was friendly and attentive, place was clean and food was good. It was nice to be able to be out with my little guy and not feel extra stress! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A delightful place for breakfast. Our ladies traveling 2nd Saturday breakfast has found a place with great food and service. Good coffee. I love the small town cozy feeling I got just minutes away from Westgate. I recommend the sweet potato hash with two eggs. You pick three other add ins. Yummy stuff."}
{"text":"I love finding hidden gems like this, especially in the west valley. Locally owned, yummy and healthy food, and friendly, attentive service. Add in an obscure location and I'm sold. 
Came for a play date after spotting the kids area here on Yelp and unknowingly arrived for Monday 10:30 AM story time. Kids area overlooks planes outside - parked and taxiing. Owners are parents themselves and cook and serve with the care and attention that parents need when looking for an experience out with their families. 
Banana pancakes and breakfast scramble were healthy, hearty and delicious. Diverse menu especially for kids. 
Will be back - with the kids or not!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and good pricing. We came for the storytime in Mondays and stayed for lunch. Growing up around airport restaurants this one ranks high.

If you have never eaten at an airport restaurant you might be in for a surprise, they have good food and friendly service. It's no five guys or fancy place, but it is a sure fire five star airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Great experience, we came here for a mom group event and we had a blast. Small location but nobody seemed to mind."}
{"text":"I am sad...  The reason for the 1 lonely star, they've closed for business.  Hubby and I went over there for brunch a few days ago and saw the sign.

This was a little hidden gem for us, they had delicious breakfasts and sandwiches.  We always enjoyed sitting by the window and watching the planes taking off and landing.  We also saw the occasional military transports that would land at this little airport, like the day we saw the Osprey's...so incredibly cool!

Oh well, Something Special Aviation Cafe, you will be missed..."}
{"text":"This food was delicious and the portions were huge. They will basically let you make any combination of food you want. Also, they have a menu of things to order if you have a little one who is just starting to eat solid food. Everyone there was super friendly. If you like cheese, then you will be happy because the cook knows how to throw on the cheese! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and watch the planes. I stop in a few times per week. Food is always good and staff is always very nice"}
{"text":"This cute place is the best to take a relaxing lunch the food is amazing and nicely priced We will def be coming back !"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the best breakfast special this am .  Spinach omelet with a delicious green chili cheese sauce, sliced tomatoes  and the yummiest sweet potato hash. They post their specials on Facebook everyday, I love knowing what they have special everyday.  Owner and personnel are awesome.  We totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop off and have lunch amazing scenery at least Ave and great food highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food here is high quality, absolutely delicious, and extremely affordable. I love that they have a kids corner for my littles to read or play while they wait for their healthy food. Kids can watch planes coming in and taking off from the beautiful patio, too! Really awesome menu and really awesome people!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing place to set and have a relaxed meal with friends. 
Located in the terminal of the Glendale air park. 
This is a family ran restaurant. The owner may be the person that waits your table and cooks your food. The food I was excellent. Burger was cooked just right, juicy and tasty. 
This was my first trip but my daughter has been there several times. A great place to bring your children to watch the airplanes. There is outside seating and with the weather getting cooler you can sit outside and watch plains coming in, people unloading and loading their planes. 
The inside of the restaurant as what you can call child friendly. There is a play area where you could.....park your child while you talk with friends. 
Very relaxed atmosphere. This made a great outing for everyone. 
I already have my next trip planned. Breakfast with a friend. 
Great place. If you don't visit you are missing out on a nice relaxing place to meet friends and have a nice meal."}
