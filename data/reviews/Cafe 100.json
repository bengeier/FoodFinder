{"text":"Great place to bring family or meet friends. Kid friendly. Good prices. Diverse menu (breakfast also available all day). Great food. Friendly staff. Lots of outdoor seating but a bit cramped inside. They also have a full bar, wine, and beer."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Cafe 100 last night for my birthday.  A friend recommended the place and didn't even know the name of it!  She just described where it was and we found it.  I'd been complaining that we can't find a great and reasonable place to eat in the area.  Well, we found it!  It's not fancy but the food was fantastic and the staff very enjoyable.  We went early (around 5:15pm) and were seated right away.  Our food came quickly and was just great!  I had the salmon and my daughter had a bacon cheeseburger.  Just can't say enough positive things about Cafe 100.  Granted it wasn't busy but the staff chatted with us and made our dinner even better than the food did.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the Best brunch place around this area. I wish the wait time is less over the weekends but still its worth a wait!!"}
{"text":"This use to be Toast Cafe, and i have to say it's just as good if not a slight bit better as in variety offered. Staff is great, food hardly takes any time.   I had the SoCal omllete, with a side of busict and gravy and it was fantastic,"}
{"text":"I went here with my uncle one time for brunch. It is a nice little caf√©, with AWESOME food, we came here cause I had never been so my uncle was like \"you have to try it is really good\" so I said sure. We pulled up and I can smell the food, it smelled so good. The only problem I had with this place was the wait, oh my gosh we had to wait so long for a table but at least that means they get good business. When we were finally seated the service was very nice, kept bringing refills for our drinks, and was very polite. When the food finally came we devoured it, it was Amazing!!! This place is so cool and I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"We moved here at the beginning of June and we go here on average once a week. Everything my family has ever gotten here has been great. Some of our favs are the stuffed French toast, broccoli/ cheese quiche, SoCal omelette, and breakfast burrito. We have yet to have dinner here but plan to soon. The outdoor, covered seating is nice also. Highly recommend Cafe 100!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this spot one Sunday morning - it is such a cozy location in downtown Huntersville that has wonderful breakfast food!  If you are ever in the area definitely stop in and hang out on the porch and enjoy a great meal in the morning sun.  Our server was so entertaining - he knew the menu and gave us great recommendations.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I called Cafe 100 to inquire about making reservations for Sunday brunch, and they were very helpful on the phone. They confirmed my reservation for 3, and I was pleasantly surprised that we were able to get reservations. We arrive on time for our reservations, and as soon as we get there, the host says we'll have a table very soon. Long story short, we kept being told we were next in line, our table would be ready very soon, etc. Overall, they had us wait 50 minutes, even though we'd had reservations. After 50 minutes, we left and went to Bojangles. It is ridiculous to make a group of 3 wait 50 minutes after their reservation, all while telling them they're next in line. Next time, I'll skip Cafe 100 completely, and go somewhere else because even Bojangles is much better than that ridiculous wait."}
{"text":"Had my first bad experience at Cafe 100 today after visiting several times.  My husband went for brunch, and being Memorial Day I expected a slight wait.  When we arrived there was one large party finishing up in outdoor seating, and there appeared to only be a couple of tables available inside.  There were a few parties waiting ahead of us, but we were told that there would only be about a 15 min. wait time for first available.  Within 10 min. the large party outdoors left, and it took about 5 min. for them to clear the tables & separate them.  We were seated & less than a minute later our waiter arrived to take our drink order.  After getting our drinks, I requested a few more minutes to decide on my entree even though my husband was ready to order.  Our waiter returned w/i a respectable amount of time to take our order.  By this time, two other parties of 2 had been seated beside us but their orders were taken after ours.   This is when things turned sour.  We waited a good 20 min. before a server came out to apologize for the wait for our food since they had just finished serving a large party inside.  He told us our food should be out shortly.  Within a couple of minutes, the table next to us received their meal & then about 5 min. after that the other table next to us received their meal.  At this point, my husband was getting very impatient & very aggravated.  I went inside & spoke with the server that gave the original apology for the wait.  He went to check with the kitchen to check on our order & w/i a few minutes came out with our order.  My husband took one bite of his Eggs Benedict to find the english muffin had not been toasted & the whole meal had been thrown together in a rushed fashion.  My meal (I ordered the Panini Special) was decent but nothing to ride home about.  The pasta salad I ordered as a side was not to disappoint though.  Very fresh & light as usual.  Overall, we waited a total of 40 min. after being seated for a meal that was poor-mediocre when usually the wait for your meal after being seated is max 20 min.  And the meal is usually very satisfying.    Thankfully, after my husband returned his Eggs Benedict to the kitchen we were told there would be no charge for our visit.  I will probably go back to let the staff/kitchen redeem themselves, but my husband will not.  Guess I'll make my next trip with friends."}
{"text":"Set up no different than the former Toast, but that's OK.  Cozy, warm, and friendly.  Florentine was well prepared, eggs were perfect.  Needed salt but I guess that's why its on the table.  Homefries were great.  Burrito was weak.  Flavors were good but very little egg inside, too much chorizo, and the egg was nasty brown overcooked into the other ingredients.  Could not identify the egg inside. Weird.  When sent back to see if that is correct, it came back to the table the same.    Service was pleasant, efficient, and knowledgeable.  We will go back, but will stay away from the burrito."}
{"text":"Love breakfast/brunch at Cafe 100. They get very busy, and sometimes there can be a long wait, but the staff is pretty good about fast service without rushing people through their meals.  A few favorites: Banana Walnut Pancakes, Biscuits & Gravy, Eggs Benedict  They always have great items on their specials board as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and they probably serve the largest mimosa I've ever gotten at a brunch place. Bonus points. The only complaint I have is the flies! If you sit outside you will most definitely be shoo-ing flies away from your food the whole time. That doesn't stop us from going back bc we are choosing to sit outside in nature afterall, but it's a little bit of a nuisance."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Omelet cooked to order perfectly. Friendly wait staff, too. I'll definitely be back.   Second time was as good as the first. Delicious fresh food - loved the Greek frittata. Atmosphere is charming and service is great."}
{"text":"Had New Year's Day breakfast/lunch here and it was delicious! I had a chorizo sausage breakfast burrito while my boyfriend had the Cuban sandwich. Both of the dishes were amazing. The only downside to eating here is the long wait -- which isn't pleasant when it's cold outside (no room to wait indoors). However, it was worth it."}
{"text":"I didn't mind the long wait, but we weren't led to our table it was pointed out. no silverware, we saw our server never. my daughter's drink never got refilled. after 45 minutes of waiting our food came and my eggs Benedict was hard boiled eggs and impossible to eat. my daughter's and husbands food was good. our server never came back even though I tried to flag everyone down. after everyone was done eating she finally came to deliver the check. I gave her my plate and just told her to take it off my check. I've never stood and sat in a restaurant for 2 hours and left starving."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, and knowledgeable staff. This important facets aside, the biggest single determining factor to me was the bacon. Great food and service can all be for naught if the bacon sucks. Their bacon is cooked correctly and thick enough to have great flavor. Highly recommend anyone who appreciates brunch try it out."}
{"text":"I created an account on Yelp just so I could review Cafe 100 in Huntersville, NC.  We had the worst experience we have ever had at any restaurant.  We went to lunch at Cafe 100 and went inside, just as the sign says, \" wait to be seated\". We stood there for over ten minutes waiting for a hostess or waiter -  all of the servers just flew by and completely ignored us. We were on our way out when a waitress told us we could go to a table outside. We sat at the table for over another 10 minutes waiting for a server. When he finally came over we were ready to order both drinks and our food but he would only take the drink order. After ordering our meals much later, we had to wait another 30 minutes for our food. (as we were ignored) The cole slaw was warm, the veggie burger too spicy. The salad greens were also warm, wilted an had some brown coloring on the leaves. The dressing lacked flavor. Flies were all over us and our food. Needless to say,  we have never had worse customer service, and as residents of Huntersville, we will never return."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast spot. Complimentary coffee cake served with coffee, and the shrimp frittata was the bomb. Everyone's food was phenomenal: bananas foster French toast, omelette, eggs Benedict, oatmeal raisin pancakes. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"My family went here on Mother's Day for brunch & it was fantastic. Seeing as it was a holiday - it was extra busy, but they handled it very well. Everyone was very organized & efficient & our server was really great (although I can't remember his name). The food was delicious & I will definitely plan to go back in the near future!"}
{"text":"The food and prices at Cafe 100 were great. We had chips and salsa and spicy potato wedges for appetizers, mac and cheese (with chicken and bacon) and a crab cake sandwich for entrees and banana pudding for dessert. Portions were good size and we enjoyed everything, especially the potato wedges. Service was prompt. We'll definitely stop in some time for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in downtown Huntersville! Great patio space and inside feels like a neighborhood hangout. Great brunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! The bananas foster pancakes were out of this world! It's the gem of a place that I've been missing since I moved back home. Definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"First visit and amazed with the location and ambience. There was a 30 minute waiting obviously for the demand and reviews. But you have to buy a drink from the bar to wait for 30 minutes otherwise you  cannot wait on the property, wait in your car may be was the response from the greeter. Disappointed. Went to metro diner little over a mile away, same 30 mins wait time and complementary coffee during wait time and the good thing is it's not a to-go cup"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal, place is small, can't get very busy. But signs of a great place to ear"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Cafe 100 having read great reviews and since we will be moving into the area soon we're looking forward to finding a great place where we can enjoy great food and have a good time. Unfortunately, Cafe 100 didn't fit the bill. We went for lunch on a weekday and were seated inside (as requested).  We ordered a cuban and a mediterranean sandwich. Food was just ok and so was our waitress, the runner /busser lady was obviously having a bad attitude day, but I've seen worse. The funny thing happened in the end. when I asked for the check I was told \" it's on the table\" and there it was an old school handwritten diner check so I look at the last number which was 17 50 and put 23 dollars down on the table. A different waitress comes to pick it up and 2 minutes later she storms back saying that the check was 23 dollars and what I left didn't cover a tip. She told me that what I interpreted as 17.50 was acually 1.75 and was my diet soda. In a word, the're was no grand total on that check (which wouldn't be a problem if there was a register/cashier person a the bar and you were to pay there but that's not the case) All of this yelling from behind the bar so pretty much the whole restaurant heard. So, I am supposed to do the math, come up with a grand total and leave a tip on top. Great maybe I should also wipe the table on my way out too. I left her 5 buck on top of the 23 dollars and left. I personally don't think it's good policy having the guests add up a check and much less get in your face about a tip when they haven't told you \"the system\" in advance. Moral of the story: most likely we won't be back . Bye Cafe 100! I'm sure you'll continue to do well without us."}
{"text":"Over all, fantastic! Came on the 4th of July while it was busy, and this place still killed it on all fronts. 15 minute wait to be seated on a very shaded patio. Server was prompt and delightful. We had three orders. Belgian waffles w/ bacon: light, fluffy, hot waffles. Bacon was thick cut and delicious as it should be. Southwestern omelette: good portion size and the red sauce MADE the burrito! Club sandwich w/ potato salad: As a chef myself, I like to see how the kitchen handles a few changes to the menu items. I subbed swiss cheese for the American cheese and  added a fried egg. The kitchen didn't miss a beat, I got exactly what I asked for! The veggies were fresh, the turkey, ham, and bacon were THICK cut, and the egg was over easy like I asked.. delicious!! Potato salad was a little under seasoned for my taste, nothing a little S&P couldn't fix. I also had a sunrise mimosa: champagne, oj, vodka, cranberry. Highly reccomended. From a service industry employee to this establishment.. fantastic job! Thank you for a fantastic experience and meal!"}
{"text":"Both Omelettes we had were fab. California and the special with cilantro. Sunrise mimosas were on point. Atmosphere overall was good, but we ended up our back by a chai link fence looking out on a parking lot. :( am investment in some bamboo reed fencing recommended. But that aside, you come ther to eat, and that was super good!"}
{"text":"Food is frish, friendly service, definitely coming back. Also i like that thay given you a cake with your coffee."}
{"text":"There is NO crab in the crab cake Benedict! The place is dirty & is a step away from serving food on paper plates!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday breakfast. I had the southwest burrito and I couldn't have been happier. The service was really good too. Get there early on a Sunday if you don't want to wait too long for a table. If you do end up waiting, it's worth it, I promise."}
{"text":"Best place in town for brunch and lunch!! Terrific atmosphere, friendly service, excellent food!! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We love eating Sat morning breakfast! Jay is always quick to seat tables, give a smile and it is obvious customer service and being friendly is key. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to be sitting snugly with the table next to the you!"}
{"text":"Love this spot for breakfast- we always get the quiche of the day or the pancake special. Great outside seating and quick food- great servers too!"}
{"text":"New to huntersville,  brought our family here for breakfast.  Amazing food, our server was very personable. He made the experience for us outsiders feel like home. Food was amazing. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Dinner!  Every thing is always so Fresh  Staff is always super friendly and they always seem to be working together To take care of you We love this plce"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is our favorite brunch place in the Charlotte area.  The standard brunch fare is always good and they come up with some very creative and tasty specials.  The owner is very amiable and welcomes your comments.  Others on here have complained about service, but the wait staff has always been very good in my mind.  The other good thing about the wait staff is that they are not different ever time we go there and I like the familarity and personal greetings.  The building is small which can require a wait sometimes, but nothing outrageous.  I think my worst wait to-date is maybe 20 minutes.  When the weather is nice there is outside dining, so there is almost never a wait.  I think I have talked myself into going tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"Jay and his team at Cafe 100 manage to impress my wife and I more and more each time we dine here.  The food is always amazing and creative and the service is always superior.  Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or just drinks this is one of the best spots in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"Just became a regular here. Food, service and cleanliness are perfect to the last detail. Prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious, not one complaint about this place."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars.  Service is almost always outstanding, the food is great and the atmosphere is comfortable and extremely friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for breakfast and it was very busy but we were seated pretty quickly. We both enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere. Cafe 100 is pretty noisy and crowded but not in an unpleasant way. It feels like a neighborhood spot and we really like that about it. Don't look to be impressed by food presentation. Cafe 100 is about good food, good service, no bells & whistles."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast in Huntersville. Adorable atmosphere and the food is incredibly good. I love their omelettes in particular."}
{"text":"This lovely little place has a large patio and a fire pit!  The interior is cozy and it'd be nice if the bar was bigger but ya gotta work with war ya got.  I was greeted by everyone like they owned the place which was comforting!  Very nice people and extremely knowledgeable about their menu.  I just stopped in for some conversation of Americana and coffee, and all the food looked delicious.  I'm going to try to head back down thru town and grab lunch tomorrow.  The jalape√±o cheese dip with pita points was an offer I shouldn't have refused, but I'll get my own tomorrow."}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is a cozy restaurant with simple decor. We enjoyed our breakfast! The portion sizes are large! My husband had the sausage chorizos burrito, which he enjoyed. I had the crab benedict, which I wouldn't order again. It wasn't bad I just prefer lump crab over a fried crab cake.  The only recommendation I have for Cafe 100 would be the service. The Team is friendly! However we had 3 Team Members approach us once seated to order our drinks then our meals. We felt as we were being rushed to order. Once we got our food no one came back to check on us until we were about to pay the bill. It may have been an off morning? We will try again though!"}
{"text":"Don't take reservations if you don't understand how they work.   We were kept waiting half an hour with only vague comments of \"some tables leaving soon.\" Why would I patronize somewhere that wastes my time?"}
{"text":"Oh my best brunch in Huntersville.  Greek feta omelet and thick crunchy bacon with sour dough toast.  Husband had western omelet.  Other persons had omelet and French toast.  All yummy delicious.  Service was great and they take reservations which is so very nice!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Cafe 100. It's time. It's time because I've reviewed several other places in the area on their breakfast experience. With each one, I come away dissatisfied, mentioning Cafe 100 in the reviews as the place I compare all other places to. Now that I've gone out, seen the world, and experienced more breakfast experiences, I can confidently say that Cafe 100 is my favorite place. My only concern with a 5-star review is that it could lead to the place becoming more popular, and, thus, more difficult to eat at.  I've been to Cafe 100 several times, with several different breakfasts. I love their Eggs Benedict, their pancakes, their French Toast (maybe the best I've ever had), and their waffles. The staff is super friendly, without being annoying. I eat in sometimes, and sometimes I get take-out. Never an issue.  I try other places sometimes because I like to cheat, but I would stop if Cafe 100 said that it bothered them."}
{"text":"The interior was very nice. The exterior could definitely use some manicuring. The food (homefries) was bland to me and lacking a \"fresh taste\". The servers seemed \"tolerant\", not warm or what I would describe as friendly. It was not a terrible experience and I will visit again for lunch probably since I  frequent Huntersville quite a bit."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place. Great menu and lovely specials. Had the salmon tonight and the honey cilantro lime drizzle was one of the best finishing sauces I have ever had on a fish. Homemade pimento cheese was also a special treat (as an appetizer).  Wish I would have know of this place before. Will certainly be my go-to place in the area from now on. Almost forgot to mention. The staff was great. Friendly, attentive, and an overall enhancement to the dinner experience."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe 100 on a Friday morning, so the weekend vibe would be quite different I suspect.  Great service from the bar, kudos to our server who took very good care of us. I got the pancakes, which were unfortunately very dry. Generous portion size though, and I heard another table raving about the breakfast burritos.  Located in a converted house, so it's not very big, which means the the dining is intimate and tight. Good outside capacity though and you can tell they work hard to keep in clean and tidy. Parking is also tight and somewhat scarce.  I think we will give them another try soon."}
{"text":"Most delicious martinis. Food was excellent last time we came. Hoping tonight will be just as good. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite brunch places. The food is always fresh and you can taste its homemade flavors. My favorite dish is the Caprese Eggs Benedict, which has a warm caprese salad on top of Eggs Benedict, so just think warm tomato, pesto, basil and mozzarella on top of an already delicious Eggs Benedict. Mmmm... My husband loves the western omelette and consistently picks that because it is hearty and full of flavor. Finally, their sides are great. My favorite choice is their homemade granola and yogurt that I pick as my side to go with my Caprese Eggs Benedict. You can't go wrong at this charming cottage with top notch food!"}
{"text":"Good food in a small house with a lot of outside seating. Experienced some elements of earlier reviews with less than attentive servers, long wait time for food (over 45 minutes) for breakfast food on a Saturday during brunch. Overall, better options up the road in Davidson with better food and faster service. Also, as noted, lots of flies when dining outside but some of that's not able to be offset."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast ! Service was excellent, French toast was phenomenal and think I found my new breakfast drink called the \"sunrise\" which will replace any Bloody Mary out there. Rick the owner was beyond friendly."}
{"text":"This is an exceptional and unique restaurant. There is always a wait on the weekends for breakfast/lunch. Excellent food, super choices and specials!! The owner knows how to run his restaurant. He is the best!! We always eat here when we go to Charlotte. Thanks Jay for your excellent customer service and attention!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I always come here when I'm in the area and always get the chicken caesar wrap. Amazing."}
{"text":"The food is fanastic!   This place has to be the best kept secret in North Carolina.   There is always a line at lunchtime and the service is exceptionally good.     I will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"This place is everything I expected and more. The peanut butter French toast was awesome. Mimosas are a must and huge. Expect a wait because it gets packed. It's small inside but has the hometown diner feel. I have not been here in the warm weather and I can only imagine how awesome the place is. I have yet to try out dinner but if it's anything like brunch I'll be back."}
{"text":"No matter what time of day you stop in you'll want to go back. My favorite menu item is the buffalo chicken wrap and side of chips with ranch. I've also had salads, quiches and soups. Indoor and outdoor seating with very quick service."}
{"text":"We went to Discovery Place Kids and decided to try lunch here.  The parking is kind of tricky for out of towners, there are lots behind the building.  It's a cute little cafe with very friendly wait staff.  The squash bisque was to die for, it was delicious.  I only got a cup, I could have eaten the whole pot!  My child got the Mac and cheese, it was home made not the cheap box kind, which was a nice change from most restaurants.  The chicken salad sandwich was quite good.  The meatloaf sandwich was ok.  I would have liked a thicker slice of meatloaf.  It had great flavor.  I asked for it to be made w/o onions, but they out them on anyways.  We used a coupon from the entertainment book for 8$ off.   The local art on the walls was beautiful and for sale.  It's great when businesses support local artists!    I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is great - everything you would want in your favorite brunch spot.  We found this gem shortly after we moved - we have been in love ever since.  We visit every weekend at least one morning a week!! The peanut butter banana French toast is awesome, the breakfast burrito is amazing.  The staff is super friendly, we will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"1 star review b/c of bad service. I went today (Friday at noon) for brunch/lunch.  It was my first visit.  I'm sorry to say it was a bad experience.  They were slammed and so I had reasonable expectations that service might be a little slow.  I was seated immediately but I had to wait 10 minutes to get a drink, the waitress insulted me for ordering eggs and a salad (saying loudly so other customers could turn, look and laugh) and then I waited 40 minutes and still no food was served. The couple sitting beside me who ordered after me got their food and were nearly finished when I gave up waiting.  I found the waitress and told her I wanted to cancel my order and leave. She insisted it was almost ready, they were backed up. This didn't add up since other tables around me (with 2+ people) were being served ahead of me and had more complicated orders. I said I was disappointed, this was my first visit and they weren't hospitable.  I left and got good service and food at Panera Bread instead.  It's too bad:  I wanted to support a local business and even find a place I could bring friends and family... but unfortunately it seems Cafe 100 doesn't know how to manage high demand times and some of its wait staff make single diners feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Everyone that works there is super friendly and gives great service.  The food is always hot and really good.  During nice weather there is a pretty big patio and sometimes there is a local person playing music.  We mostly go for breakfast and their sunrise mimosas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"After all the good reviews I am sad that we had a horrible experience. We we seated at 615pm which was our reservation. 2 adults, 2 kids. No bread was given to us as it was to others. Took 10 minutes for drinks. Food was delivered 45 minutes after that. Dessert was quick but really really bad. Peach cobbler was disgusting.  Their meat loaf was a hamburger cut in 2  The gravy was good Drinks stayed empty for 10-15 minutes.  We left after about 2 hours after we were seated. Not sure if they were short staff or what but wasn't as good as people say Others that were sitting around us were complaining also"}
{"text":"Simply put, the BEST place for Brunch in the Huntersville and Cornelius area.   We came here one morning because I read a couple good reviews and as we made our way to our seats we rubbernecked by every table we passed admiring the delicious creations they were eating. This is one of those places where you find yourself interrupting another person just to ask them what they ordered because it all looks so good.   My first bite reminded me of that feeling I had leaving for college, spending years away from home, then returning to my mom's house and eating that first long missed home cooked breakfast.   This restaurant is located in what was once a residential home in downtown Huntersville. It has a large patio and deck for outside seating, and the inside is very welcoming, I felt like I was sitting in my grandmother's home. They even fit a small bar inside.   Our experience is strictly brunch at this point, but we have been over a dozen times and every weekend features different specials of newly created food creations that have all turned out delicious. You can befriend them on facebook to keep tabs on the daily specials. I have not had one bad experience here, however the crowd keeps getting larger every weekend, so a wait has already started.  The prices are very reasonable as well, around 8 dollars for the majority of the breakfast items and specials.  Jordan has been our favorite server so far, he has a good personality and is on the ball. I have witnessed him getting quadruple sat before, and we still did not have to wait long.   They give free coffee cake while you wait for your meal on Sat and Sun brunches. Great place to bring guests visiting from out of town or to start your own weekend tradition as we have."}
{"text":"Cute place with a nice outdoor dining area. Menu was imaginative and had potential but some dishes lacked in execution. To note, the crabcake was mostly breading with little crab to barely flavor it. With that alone, it would have been a 2 star review but the Cuban sandwich was good. Wait staff was efficient if not overly personable. I could see this place as having a lot of potential, but not quite there yet."}
{"text":"We've been a couple of times for brunch, and have always enjoyed the food. The blue corn and bacon belgian waffle was surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"the food was okay, nothing to write home about.  we got the hummus appetizer. the hummus was nothing amazing.  i got the grilled veggie wrap-it was okay. my husband got lasagna & he didnt particularly care for it.  the decor is cozy."}
{"text":"The place has the three Gs. Great place. Great healthy choices. Great Service. Will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in on the way back to South Carolina for breakfast there  southwestern breakfast burritos were fantastic, make sure you're very hungry though eggs benedict look awesome."}
{"text":"Great when it's great, bad when it's bad. This is by far the most inconsistent restaurant in the area. I'll order something one day it's absolutely fabulous. Go in the very next week and have the worst dining experience ever. From the food to the wait staff. I look at this one as a management issue. No other explanation to not have the \"team\" on the same page as far as expectations go."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and brunch in huntersville. The food is top quality and service is always spot on. You must try the caprese Benedict or the crab cake Benedict. Great mimosas at a fantastic price. They also make killer omelets. There is one they do with chorizo that is ecstasy."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the service was phenomenal. The ahi tuna was one of the best I have ever had! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here (feels like you're in someone's little house) and the reviews were good but I'm giving two stars because the food really wasn't that great, IMO. It was just okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, although the service was prompt and friendly. I wouldn't mind sitting outside for coffee when the weather's nice - outside area looks nice, but probably wouldn't bother with the food again."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  The quiche is worth the wait on a Saturday morning.  Make sure you try the Reuben for lunch and Fish Taco for dinner."}
{"text":"The food and service were good, but not great, and a little pricey. That's why I give them only 3 stars... We weren't astonished by the experience. Maybe we'll give them another try in the future and change our mind."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast, exceeds usual breakfast options, nice outdoor atmosphere, food fresh and attention to detail.  Don't miss this if you're nearby"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. This was our first time here being that my husband received a recommendation to try the restaurant. You get coffee cake as an appetizer which was a pleasant surprise. We ordered French toast, pancakes, and eggs. Everything was ok, it might have been the syrup but I was not impressed. Since the atmosphere was so great though, we will probably give this restaurant another chance and try lunch."}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is a good place to go for late breakfast or brunch.  It is in the heart of downtown Huntersville, with all of the other artsy type places where many go without getting in the crowds of the malls.  As far as my meal ....well I am going to partially blame myself for wanting more out of a waffle!  The waffle was just OK.  It was really the atmosphere inside and outside the Cafe that was nice.  The staff was nice, and the restaurant was pretty cozy.  I believe it used to be someone's residence!  If you are having an intimate or top secret business lunch....you want want to choose a table that is not close to other patrons.  Some areas of the restaurant have tables that are very close.  One day I will return so that I can change my first impression of the restaurant that has such a great reputation and rating!"}
{"text":"Love it here! The southwest scramble is surprisingly delicious! Everything is fast and efficient. This is definitely our favorite brunch spot in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"the best breakfast spot in Huntersville. bypass Metro Diner, bypass the Toastery- come here. everything is fresh, and the service is great. it's my go to for out of town guests- esp brunch. i have yet to visit for dinner, but i've no doubt they're capable."}
{"text":"We had a solid lunch at a reasonable price.  My wife had the pimento burger with a side of coleslaw and I had the chicken bacon Asiago ranch panini.  The burger was ok and the panini was flavorful.  The service was friendly."}
{"text":"One of the top spots for lunch and brunch around the Huntersville/Charlotte area. I've had their pancakes, Cobb Salad, and panini's which are amazing and their Sunrise Mimosas are the best I've found in Charlotte, or basically ever. Who doesn't want vodka in their mimosas?"}
{"text":"We met some family here for breakfast on a Sunday morning recently.  We arrived there at a great time as there was not much of a wait, but when we left, it was packed and the line was long.  Unfortunately, the place is small and cramped and there is really no where to wait.  Good luck going there on a stormy day.  I had the frittata with biscuits and gravy and husband had the burrito.  The portion sizes are huge, and I would say they could cut back on that and cut back on prices as they don't really make for great leftovers, it was only so so as leftovers.  My frittata was good and my husband loved his burrito.  The biscuits and gravy were not good, gravy lacked flavor.  Overall, cramped space with some good food and other not so good food.  I've had much better breakfasts that I have gone away thinking WOW, but here, I could pass and not think about going back."}
{"text":"A van full of girls pulled up to this wonderful little spot on Saturday, March 7th around 11am... Our fearless leader called ahead so we had reservations...  Upon arriving, our table (for 10) wasn't ready yet, but within 15 minutes of waiting, we were seated! We were VERY well cared for, and very promptly served...  I had a mimosa (ok, look... it was four mimosas in one large wine glass... no joke... WOW!) and the Caprese Benedict... Everything about my meal was delightful from the coffee cake placed on the table when we arrived (light, fluffy, sweet, but not TOO sweet), the water that was brought out immediately for all, the service of a large party in a tight space with a lovely smile, and the delicious food... my eggs were poached perfectly, the English muffin was toasted and crisp, the mozzarella, tomato and pesto were flavorful, and the amount of hollandaise was perfect (topping my meal with a hint of sauce... not smothering it)...  I really appreciate the care and how nicely we were treated!  If you all are going to INSIST upon being so great, you might want to consider expanding! ;) Thanks for the lovely brunch! PS - I LOVE that you can get yogurt and granola as a side to any meal!"}
{"text":"I've driven by a million times and finally stopped in.  Great atmosphere, cozy, and good food.  It seems food would be consistent, which is good to know.  I ordered avocado, turkey & tomato (post workout) definitely hit the spot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We often frequent Cafe 100 for Sunday brunch, before the church crowd rolls in.  We tend to order the same things when we eat here (which is rather unusual for us), so I can't speak to the quality of the entire menu. I often order the Eggs Benedict; it is rare to find a restaurant that does a good job with hollandaise sauce, and Cafe 100's is fantastic. The complimentary coffee cake while you wait for your food is a nice touch.  The kid's menu is lacking a egg/pancake option, so for my daughter we usually order 1 scrambled egg and 1 pancake from the sides menu, which comes out to roughly the same price as the kid's menu. She never has any problems clearing her plate at Cafe 100!  The quiche has never disappointed, and the daily specials usually sound (and taste) delicious! I am usually not a fan of white sangria, but they make an absolutely amazing white sangria with frozen melon balls...just be careful, there is a lot more alcohol in that glass than you can taste!  I docked one star for service. Most of the time the service is exemplary (especially Jay) , but there are two servers (one guy, one girl), that are horrendous. Bored, grumpy, and generally quite unpleasant to be around. I recently took a friend for the first time, and unfortunately we had the latter servers. It was rather embarrassing to receive such terrible service at a place I frequently rave about."}
{"text":"Recently had the NY Strip with garlic butter. Dear. God. So, so, soooo good. Again, with a bottle of Louis Martini, what more do you need? GREAT Friday spot. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Cute little place that does allow call ahead seating.  We had a great breakfast and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Burritos are ginormous and very tasty! Cool little spot with indoor and outdoor seating. Reasonably priced. Def a good bang for your buck and good food too!! Ill be back.   Update- Went back and ordered an omelette and that was amazing too!! Such great food and service!"}
{"text":"Love eating here, love the food and the selection and the specials.  If you come during lunch or breakfast hours or on the weekend, you WILL wait. And its pretty disorganized sometimes. They need to add a host or just one more person to help. That would make it amazing.  Seems like there are just two waiters sometimes and even in off hours there are quite a bit of people so it is the reason for 4 stars not 5.   That said I don't come now during busy times, so late afternoon or early evening and it's much better. They still are busy for two waits, but they aren't usually as frazzled. Just the best ambiance and really good food make this a must if you are in the Huntersville area. The Crab Benedict is a favorite, lightly done and the sauce is great. Quiche du Jour usually amazing, sandwiches, paninis are fantastic. I will be coming a long time as I am trying everything, but dang the specials rock so don't always get to the menu,   If you come once I bet you come back."}
{"text":"Pros: amazing mimosas best brunch ever Cons: none  Great outdoor seating too plus great music selection"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 has improved over the years. The breakfast and brunch are good. They have daily lunch specials. We enjoy sitting outside. I would recommend the Eggs Benedict or breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Went on an early sat afternoon, it was packed. Cute place, tons of outdoor seating. Very casual and affordable. Too hot for us to sit outside, so we sat at the bar. Some of us got breakfast & others got lunch. The biscuits and gravy are to die for-a MUST try. I had the crab cake sandwich and it was delish! Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Huntersville in a older house with local artwork all over the walls.  There is a large deck with outdoor seating and on several occasions I've seen guests with adorable dogs enjoying their brunch together.  When we have been here, it's always busy, I suggest coming earlier in the morning to prevent a wait.   The breakfast menu can please anyone from simple to daily specials.  They bring out coffee cake while you wait for your food.  The portions are large.  The food is fresh,  the waitress allowed us to make a few swaps to our orders.  My husband got one of the breakfast burritos with jalape√±os, and it was spicy!  I prefer the breakfast enchiladas which I wasn't able to finish!    For the life of me I cannot remember the name of this drink, but it was a mimosa with vodka and a splash of cranberry juice too, it was delish!  I should mention they use OJ with pulp."}
{"text":"Want to get away?  If you are a coastal (or mountain) escape type foodie - you must try this cafe! Such charm, great fresh food and most importantly wonderful service (truly like a family/team!). Cafe 100 reminds me of some of our fave eateries while on vacation! Upon our first visit we experienced the inviting vibe and fabulous food, plus the community of regulars - and felt part of the \"family\". The NY strip was as good as a steakhouse (technically better!) and veggies were great! Their other specials are creative and full of flavor, too! (Great value for the quality received - bonus.) Last night we returned and I felt that same \"on vacay\" feel as we did the first visit. What a special place to sip and dine and feel like you \"got away\" for a bit and snuck in a visit with your second family :) Thank you Jay & wonderful team (ok, family!)"}
{"text":"Been years since we were here. The prices are a bit high but this is really a place for the young and young at heart.  The food is great had a Carolina burger and wife had (quesh) can't spell. Everything was great. Will return. Ole"}
{"text":"I've stopped in a couple times, but havn't delved to far into the menu.  Its similar to the prior restaurant Toast.  It a great place to get some breakfast if your palate is a little more sophisticated than waffle house.  They have different specials daily and close right after lunch.  Once I get a little more into the menu I'll do an update.  Pretty much, if your in huntersville its a must to at least give it a try."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite local restaurants in the Huntersville area. While the wait can be long during prime time hours, because it is a popular restaurant in a small house. However, it is always worth the wait. I have never ordered anything I didn't love.   The specials are always amazing -- if it sounds good, order it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to give Caf√© 100 another try.  First attempt was Mother's Day 2015.  Our order was taken over 1 hour after our reservation time.  Second try, Father's Day 2016.  Weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation time.  The guy managing the tables was friendly enough, but the reasons sounded like excuses:  We had some tables linger longer than expected, sorry someone spilled water, etc.  The root cause here is they can't really live up to reservations on Holidays or perhaps they are letting in people without reservations ahead of them...either way I should learn not to come here on a Holiday.  Again, the food is decent so it's probably worthwhile on a random weekday."}
{"text":"Absolutely right on the 'SPOT'!!! Went to try Luigi' for the 1st time & they didn't serve breakfast (which is what I was looking for). So I almost settled for Waffle House, when the guy driving behind me had parked. And I had a quick flash on how the food here is always right on the money & with using pure ingredients! Always a pleasure to eat here. The staff welcomes everyone warmly & recognizes the locals as they are... family/friends!!!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely brunch outside on the porch at Cafe 100, a quaint little cafe in downtown Huntersville. They have a wide array of menu items that can be attractive to any taste buds, whether you're craving breakfast or lunch. Upon seating, you're served with some homemade coffee bread, which is delicious. I went with the weekend special, a sweet potato hash with over easy eggs, chorizo, onions, peppers and hollandaise sauce. Very tasty and a large portion! We also tried the breakfast burrito and omelet avocado. Next time, I'm eyeing the stuffed French toast. Service was good, food was good and atmosphere was excellent. We look forward to trying another meal here or coming back for live music."}
{"text":"Food is delish, atmosphere is super quaint...yes, service is slow at times but always friendly and always greet you with a smile at the door!"}
{"text":"Went last night and enjoyed a pleasant dinner with my wife. It happened to 1/2 price bottle of wine night which was a nice surprise. We ordered a burger and lasagna which were both tasty and were nice sized portions. I ordered my burger medium-rare and but it ended up being cooked closer to well-done which was a bit disappointing. Overall, Cafe 100 is a quaint place which provides a nice atmosphere, great food and inexpensive prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, really cool setting. If we lived closer we'd come more often."}
{"text":"Favorite place for brunch! Just right down the street. Definitely recommend you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is a must for your breakfast or brunch experience! Daily specials are amazing!! Portions appropriate, priced right -- the best part: THE CAFE 100 TEAM! Customer service done right! If you want to see how a restaurant team should work - sit at the bar like we do and you'll have a front row seat to their amazing teamwork! We're happy and privileged to be regulars! Keep up the great work and great food!!"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 has the best crab cake meal! The greens and mashed potatoes that go with this meal are wonderful! It's such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place offers a solid breakfast and has a good vibe about it. It's the quintessential local diner that gets crowded with your friends and neighbors every weekend, and rightfully so. You may have to wait for a table because it's small inside, but the wait is probably worth it. Try not to hug your waitress when you sample their turkey sausage and ricotta pancakes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this little place. The food is always amazing, it's so cute and quaint. The service is always quick and non-invasive. Great place for breakfast, sunrise mimosas and a chat!"}
{"text":"Got here at 11:20. Seated and ordered at 12:30. Our waitress just now at 12:50 informed us that they ran out of the dish 2/4 of us requested. Not too pleased."}
{"text":"The food is always good and the services is great. Every time I visit, I try to select the special. If not, I recommend the quiche -- any of them! They are all good. The outside seating is nice if you're unable to sit inside. It's small and sometimes a long wait, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.   Staff is very friendly.   Food was great! !  Can't wait to go back.   Very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I handled business at the local DMV today and decided to drop in for a little something to eat and coffee. I came in around lunch and it wasn't very crowded at all, which I liked. I chose to sit in a section alone because I planned to read my book. Someone came over quickly and took my order, of coffee and the salad with goat cheese, cranberries and pecans. I thought I would miss the chicken or salmon, but NO! They must've known I loved goat cheese and cranberries because they loaded me up and I was quite happy. The balsamic paired with it nicely. Overall, I enjoyed my time here. I would come back again to try their other items."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Charlotte area and we decided to come to this establishment for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  It has both, indoor and outdoor seating. It was a beautiful morning so we decided to sit outside.  I ordered the Southwestern scramble with chorizo and it was amazing.  Very flavorful.  Overall, this place was awesome.  Great ambiance outside and the waiting staff was polite and personable.  I definitely want to come back to try a few other items on the menu.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"After a 25 min wait we were finally seated.  We ordered our drinks and food because we were starving!  It took an hour before the waiter checked on us and when we asked the status of our food he told us the kitchen had only just started it.  We ordered a couple reubens, a wrap, a breakfast burrito, and kids butter pasta (which had absolutely no flavor).  Then after another waitress brings us the food we don't see our original waiter until we are finished paying the check.  The food itself wasn't worth the wait or the hubbub.  I'd rather go to the Dish in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS. After being reminded to check back with this bookmark via the \"Friends with Benedicts\" edition of the Local Yelp, I found myself in awe of what I figure to be the most legitimate breakfast joint in all of North Charlotte.   There are big shoes to fill here so let's get rollin... First, this place is THE dive bar of breakfast/ brunch restaurants. The layout is perfectly simple, laid back, and has a bit of a hippie vibe. Perfect for a weekend morning with nothing but a relaxing day ahead of you. I dig.   Second, the staff. These people are great. Very attentive and friendly.   Third, the service. On a VERY busy Sunday morning, we got our food much quicker than expected. ...And given the crowd size!  Lastly- THE FOOD. And I have to say, yes, I got myself that crab benny that, I tell ya, is an absolute must! Perfect flavors and great presentation. I had to get it with the side of biscuit and gravy. TAKE NOTE: IT WAS A PERFECT COMPLIMENT.   I also tried the bacon infused waffle... just. Wow.   These people know BREAKFAST!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit huntersville I make this my breakfast stop, never been dissatisfied, fast service and the food is very well portioned. They make you feel at home. Dog friendly in the outside seating areas."}
{"text":"When we sat down it was a few minutes before someone came and took our drinks. After that it was another 10-15 before another server came to take our order. I ordered the western omelette with home fries, my wife ordered the cbt panini and pancakes and chips for our daughters. The food service was timely once we placed our order, but the food quality is where the 2 stars comes from. My omelette was tepid at best and my home Fries had no crisp but were mushy and over seasoned. My wife's panini was dripping in grease and her hands were covered in it. Also her turkey bacon was undercooked and her home fries were mushy as well. The girls pancakes were thick and chewy and the potato chips that are in the house made sides section were store bought (as the server told us). This meal cost us $30 and due to the quality of the food and the amount it cost us we will not be returning."}
{"text":"both brunch and dinner menu are amazing! Tight accommodations and delayed service due to packed house on most demanding shifts. Parking is tricky but worth the adventure. Very cozy and I love the environment. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience. Can't even rate the food because we waited an hour and just decided to leave instead. We asked the waitress what was taking so long and only got a rude response in return they were busy and she was not apologetic at all. There was only 3 of us and we had only ordered an omelette, pancakes, and a panini. In no place that I have ever been to has it taken that long. Do not be fooled by the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent meal in a nice outdoor setting.  Enjoyed the slider appetizer although I could have used a little ketchup.  Wife's soup was very good although the cup was very small.  Seared ahi was an excellent choice for dinner.  Large piece of tuna cooked perfectly.  Meatloaf was another excellent choice which we enjoyed again for lunch the next day.  Excellent service and very reasonable price.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best bistro style food ever. I had the quiche du jour and my wife had the crab cakes entr√©e.    I highly highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for the first time today. It was a Saturday and the wait was 30 minutes, but we were fine to wait. And it was DEFINITELY worth the wait! I got one of their specials (shrimp 'n sausage omelette creation) and she got the peanut butter and banana stuffed French toast. Both were delicious! The total bill, not including tip, was around $23, which is pricey for breakfast, but the food really was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great local place for breakfast! I highly recommend. Even though we went during primetime on Saturday morning, we didn't wait long for a table.... and it was excellent! We will be back."}
{"text":"Love breakfast here! Jay and the staff always take good care of us and I have been dying for a breakfast appetizer (coffee cake) for years! My favorites are the southwest scramble, Greek frittata, SoCal omelette (though I preferred when they used slices of avocado to the guacamole) and quiche.   Good tip: you can call ahead and put your name on the list or make a reservation. It can get busy!! If you forget to do that, you can ask for coffee while you wait"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit for breakfast.  A few months back we met friends on the weekend; today, I met a colleague for breakfast, too.  For the Saturday with friends,  I called ahead and our table was ready as planned even though there was a line forming.  Mid-week was easy-peasy, however.  Both times (busy and slow), the service was excellent, food choices abundant, and prices very reasonable.  Food came promptly and to order and I enjoyed my choices.  They must have refilled my coffee 5x!  Good job all the way around."}
{"text":"Recently visited here on a Saturday with a group of 9 people before heading up to the wine country. Great place to stop for a big breakfast before sipping wine all day. I had the special, mushroom and asiago quiche with a side salad and potatoes. It was very filling and satisfied my hunger the entire day. They also bring you out a basket of fresh coffee cake which holds you over until you get your food. The mimosas are LARGE amd fresh. They are the equal to about 3 regular drinks that I've had elsewhere. The staff is very, very nice and accomodating. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I could never say enough great things about Cafe 100. Their food is delicious and their mimosas are even better. I usually get the veggie omelette with home fries which is always so good. Be prepared to wait when you go, they are always busy. But believe me when I say, wait, grab a cup of coffee and stay. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cafe 100 will certainly be put on favorite list for brunch. The waffles and burgers are the best."}
{"text":"I am torn between 2 and 3 stars.  First time I had the Eggs Caprese and they were FABULOUS! So great in fact, that I then recommended that my husband, brother and sister in law join me there for breakfast less than a week later.   WHAT A CHANGE! And not for the better!  There are two morning waitstaff, a man and a woman. The woman is delightful. I am going to assume the male is related to the owner, or has incriminating photos that keep him employed. I very specifically asked what sort of crab was used on the crab Benedict. He did not know and came back with the answer of fresh back fin pasteurized crab. Okay...never had it pasteurized, but fresh back fin meat, I'll give it a try.  What came out were CRAB CAKES! I abhor crab cakes. If I wanted that, I'd order that. I reminded him of his answer and he said the crab cakes had the pasteurized crab meat in them. Really?   My husband ordered a breakfast burrito. ICE COLD when it came out. The cheese had already congealed hard again by the time he got it. My sister in law was the smart one and ordered what I'd chosen before and it was good.  My brother had the Western and it was rated 'meh' by him and he is NOT a foodie! Sort of like Mikey from Life...he'll eat anything!  Once we paid our bill not a single offer of coffee refill was offered even as we sat and continued to converse. There were many open tables so it was not as if we were keeping a long line of waiting customers from being able to sit and order.   First time I'd have given it a solid four, this time I couldn't make it to three. :("}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Love that you can make a reservation for breakfast. Food is great and so are the waiters. Have never had anything bad to eat. Love how the made an old house into a restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a great local find. We moved here less than a week ago and we wanted to find our local go to place....now we found it! Super friendly, quaint and delicious! Plus they have local artist displayed for purchase and enjoyment on the walls. They also have live music during the month. We went for breakfast, but I can't wait to try lunch, dinner and drinks there."}
{"text":"If you're too lazy to make breakfast, especially if you have out-of-towners visiting, this is the go to spot. It's also a go-to after yoga which is right across the street from it (Oasis Yoga Center). The food is something you can make at home. Nothing out of the ordinary. Once you're seated you get a plateful of their signature coffee cake. Service is friendly, knowledgeable and generally quick. This spot also offers outside seating which is nice during the fall but not so great during the summer months due to the bugs and humidity. On the weekends they usually have quiche and soup specials which is definitely worth checking out. Parking is tight and there's usually a wait to be seated so get there as early as you can."}
{"text":"My all time favorite local restaurant!  Jay and his staff are always welcoming and it feels homey with really great food!  Their weekend breakfast specials are great and their evening specials as well. Our go to when we eat out!"}
{"text":"Sunday was my first time here. The actually place was nice...cute outside too but we sat inside. To be honest, we left rather disappointed. I had high hopes coming to this place based off all the other reviews. The French toast wasn't cooked long enough and was so soft. Syrup just made it soggy because it wasn't crispy. It wasn't terrible just wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend ordered a Belgian waffle which he said was okay. Besides from the food just being okay, the staff was great. The only thing I HATED was we sat along the walkway, across from the bar which is also right by the front door. Don't sit there! The staff works their butts off. However, the bus boys and staff were practically running through restaurant. The place is so small inside they have to shout to customers to move out the way because they have to pass. It seemed like they were unorganized but trying REALLY hard to be organized. Just overall too hectic which made me uncomfortable. The outside seems like a better option, less hectic. 100 Cafe isn't bad, it's just not what I expected...at all. Maybe if they had more staff they wouldn't have to literally be running through the restaurant or if they had a manager keeping the walking path clear for staff, it would help? It also took forever and they had a line to pay the bill. Unfortunately, I won't be returning. Just not my type of place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. First, the room we were in was so hot. I don't even think they had air conditioning. We heard other people complaining as well. Second, the server came by right away gave us drinks, came back a minute later to ask what we wanted and we told her we needed a little time. Well, 20 minutes went by as she just stood by the bar and never once came by to take our order so we just left. I can't believe how rude and unprofessional that was. I will never return."}
{"text":"New to town and was looking for somewhere to have brunch and this place more than met our expectations. Great food and menu. Very friendly staff and very good service despite the fact they were super busy. Had a mimosa and their signature sunrise mimosa and both were fantastic. Will definitely be frequent customers here."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to like this place. It's quaint, it's artsy and the menu seems like it'd be the perfect breakfast destination. In Caf√© 100's defense, it probably would be a lovely little restaurant if it wasn't so constipated with people. My beau and I had wanted to try the place out and finally ventured in one Sunday morning. Now I realize Sunday morning is probably the busiest time of the week for a place like this, but what we experienced felt like a fire hazard. There is busy and then there is this place.  We had to wait 30 minutes outside to be seated; The small foyer was so stuffed with people, it would have been extremely uncomfortable to wait inside. Outside, there was also a hungry mob standing shoulder to shoulder with us as we silently awaited our seat. Finally, we were shown to a small, two seat table crammed about a foot apart from two other tables. Directly behind us, there was more cramped seating. Do not go here if you suffer from claustrophobia or plan on any private conversation. Your neighboring tables are nearly right on top of you. So much so in fact, people had to walk sideways to get past us. Thank heavens no one of exceptional girth sat back there as they may have been trapped.  Our server was as friendly as possible but it was apparent she felt rushed.  She had our coffee and a complimentary slice of coffee cake out shortly which was a nice gesture. They realize guests are going to have a wait, so the coffee cake helps ease the hunger pains in the process. It's very smart and helpful, especially because we did end waiting for quite some time. When breakfast finally arrived, it wasn't bad. It also wasn't anything I would have left home for; Let alone anything worth braving that crowd for. The size of that crowd made me feel bad for the servers, I can't imagine what it's like to work in such a cramped work environment with that many people. Because the servers were completly swamped, we were more forgiving of the fact we asked repeatedly for things like butter for our English muffins and didn't receive them.   All in all, my experience of Caf√© 100 would probably be quite different if they were located in a building large enough to accommodate the grand crowd they attract. Really, if you're good enough to draw that much business, why pack your patrons into a tiny sardine box? I'm sure with adequate space and servers, this place has a lot more potential. As is, it was just meh bordering into uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town this was a special treat. We enjoyed the food and the service was great. I highly recommend this local dining experience."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Lake Norman.  The staff and the food are both excellent.  This place can get busy and it's for good reason (it's that good)."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the staff treats you like family. It's like a \"Cheers\". The owner is extremely kind. Make sure to call ahead, especially on Sunday's. It gets super busy real quick. It's probably because this place is like a prized possession. If you do end up having to wait, just do it. I promise it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. It was my first time, but friend and her husband frequent it. I loved the quaint atmosphere and the great food."}
{"text":"I just don't get the rave reviews for this place. This was my third time here for breakfast, and it will probably be my last. It certainly won't hurt their business, though; there is always a line.  Today I had a cheese omelette with potatoes and rye toast. I don't like their version of breakfast potatoes at all - way too much paprika. The omelette was good.  I was dining alone and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Waiter took my drink order, brought the drink and walked away. I guess he thought I was waiting for someone to join me. He also didn't bring me any of the complimentary corn bread. I guess solo diners don't get any.  Finally a different waiter took my order and food came quickly enough. Rest of wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Total time here, as a solo diner, at noon on an August Sunday, was 70 minutes. Others seem to love this place. Me, not so much."}
{"text":"I like the casual neighborhood good feeling that cafe 100 exudes. We like coming here and relaxing and eating good food. I heard the crab cakes are out of this world but I always seem to order something else and I never leave disappointed. We walked right in and even though we didn't have a reservation we were able to sit at the bar and eat dinner there.  If you want a casual dining experience with good service and food, cafe 100 is a great option."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night.  The salmon special and my partner had the quiche.  Both were beyond good, and for a little dinner in a small town, 5 star.  Thursday is 1/2 price wine night and the selection is on par with other places in the area.  If you come here, you will not be upset."}
{"text":"Casually chic local spot in Hunterville.  Cozy inside, little porch, and a nice patio to choose from.  Very sweet little restaurant with terrific food.  We had Mediterranean Chicken and Meatloaf and both were delicious.  We splurged and had Banana Pudding and Chocolate Mousse.  I am giving 5 stars based on the entire experience, but mostly for the chef getting Banana Pudding done correctly the way a Southern Momma would make it.  Homemade pudding, vanilla wafers, ripe bananas, and real meringue browned in the oven!  Perfection!  The chefs Eric and Reyes are doing a fabulous job and our server, Gabby had the personality and knowledge to make our evening very special.  Great job!  I will be back and next time for breakfast based on the rave reviews from others."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with some friends on a Saturday and the place was packed which is always a good sign. Plus, one of the reasons we picked it in the first place was because of the reviews by other Yelpers. The menu has a wide variety of items many of which were different/unique. You must try the SoCal Omelet (my variation: Egg Whites only and add Turkey to the original menu) it was delicious."}
{"text":"Little place in downtown Huntersville that many people don't know about but should.  Breakfast was outstanding and the vibe in the place was a lot of fun.  Only eaten there once but It won't be the last time."}
{"text":"Just plain awesome. The food is always superb and I cannot wait to go back. Highly recommend cafe 100"}
{"text":"What every American wants, a place to call home.   Best food and atmosphere one could expect from a non-chain local restaurant.  Nice days, eat in or out...all the staff assist and provide an excellent experience.    The owner Jay is one of a kind down to earth guy who knows customer service.   This is the place where you usually know someone local.   Not a good place to go if your having an affair!"}
{"text":"Below Average score for a below average place, nothing particularly offensive but no reason to go back and they could have done much better on a couple of things.  Ordered a bfast burrito and home fries.  Home fries were mashy soggy potatoes with zero flavor. Burrito with sausage had about 4 specs of sausage the size of a rice krispie.  Coffee stayed full, servers were nice and food was fast."}
{"text":"Excellent menu at reasonable prices.  Fast service.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for excellent ambience customer service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Solid preparation, fresh and tasty.  Fantastic service, clean quaint atmosphere.  Interesting menu and great homemade preparation. Delish salad dressings and salsa.  Definitely worth a try if you are looking for interesting brunch menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The waffle with bacon in it is so inventive and tastes amazing. I will forever stop for breakfast when near here. Great Job!"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice and there isn't much to say about this place. Any other restaurant makes similar dishes and the food isn't anything to brag about. The coffee isn't all that special.    Both times I've gone the service wasn't that great. On one occasion, my table was forgotten about and something as simple as eggs and toast took 30-40 minutes.   Nice to be outside but overall, it's not worth the effort, time, or money."}
{"text":"I'm wavering on this review.  Honestly recent experiences have been 2 stars, but they offer my favorite waffle of all time - the Cafe Waffle.  Waffle plus bacon equals a happy Stephanie.  But the last visit was just really subpar.  I called approximately 4 weeks prior to my event.  It was my birthday and needed a reservation for 8.  Owner (?) was super duper nice,  he always is.  He took down all of my info,  seemed to be looking at a calendar to confirm they were free.  I assumed he wrote down the reservation.  Fast forward to the Friday before the event,  I called to confirm headcount.  No record of my reservation.  Again the person I talked to was super nice, but that was annoying.  I had ppl coming from quite a distance (hello Gastonia!) and Cafe 100 gets packed, it's a small venue.  I did not want ppl to show up and have to wait and wait.   Well..............that's exactly what happened.  I emphasized BE ON TIME! to my usually late crew.  So of course they were early.  Reservation was for noon,  everyone showed up around 11:45.  Not Cafe 100's fault.  However we didn't get seated until 12:15 due to stragglers.  Again I'm not faulting Cafe 100.  Everything else that transpired...well, Cafe 100 that's on you.  It took forever to get service.  Food was just meh, and two of the orders were messed up.  I specifically asked for the Cafe Waffle.  My girlfriend overheard me say Cafe Waffle...and said quote \"I'll have what she's having.\"  And we both got two regular waffles, not the cafe bacon waffle goodness.  And food didn't appear until well after 1pm.  We mentioned the issue to the waitress to make sure that were weren't charged for the more expensive waffle.  She assured us we weren't...and then said \"I can bring you a cafe waffle.\"  I said no I didn't want to hold up the table.  She assured me it wouldn't take long and it would be to go.  So when you hear a waitress offer to make a botched meal order good what do you think?  Free....well needless to say I was surprised when I was given my cafe waffle, to go..with a bill.  I mentioned this to the food runner and he was awesome..he took care of it.  No worries.  It just was kind of a cluster and no one walked away really satisfied.  Sorry Charlie...I will continue to frequent this place b/c damn that waffle is good...but the service has continued to be meh."}
{"text":"Snuggled in a cute little home, Cafe 100 is quaint and inviting.  I must have driven past it dozens of times but never noticed it before.  I was over whelmed with the menu, full of wonderful looking brunch items like french toast, omelets and heuvos rancheros.  They also have a lunch menu but I knew I wanted breakfast so I didn't even look (I should have at least glanced).  I ordered off the specials menu... some sort of breakfast burrito with sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, eggs, beans, wrapped in a tortilla and covered in a red chili sauce and cheese, served with sour cream.  I asked the waitress to add jalapenos -- I like my burritos spicy.  While it wasn't the best breakfast burrito that I've had, it definitely stopped my craving.  My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict.  He said it was very good but definitely needed more hollandaise sauce.  The best part of our visit was our helpful server. She was knowledgable, friendly and full of bubbly spirit.  I wanted a mimosa but she recommended a different version of this popular drink that a regular customer made up... orange juice, cranberry juice, champagne and a shot of vodka.  Of course we ordered two.  These made us very happy.  I really want to give this place 4 stars but I can't and I think it's my fault.  I should have ordered the french toast.  They had a lot of toppings I could have added to the french toast that I would have really enjoyed but in the end I don't think my burrito was all that it could have been.  Don't get me wrong, I will definitely be back to this place and will write a follow up review for sure."}
{"text":"Might just be my fav local restaurant in Huntersville. The food is fantastic and the owners and servers are super cool. They don't try too hard. They're just all around good, down to earth people. My fav time to go is for Saturday or Sunday brunch at which time the Sunrise cocktail is a must. This drink is no ordinary mimosa. First of all the glass is huge. And I've watched the servers fix this drink, there's very little OJ, yet there's lots of champagne and.....my fav....vodka. After a couple of Cafe 100's sunrises, you will be in a good mood for sure!"}
{"text":"The wife and I showed up on a whim Sunday morning and we able to grab a table immediately. Our server, Jordan, was HILARIOUS! He threatened to rap the specials menu to us if we were not ready by the time he brought our drinks out. Unfortunately we were ready, so we did not get to experience his lyrical food masterpiece.  I did end up ordering one of the specials, the chorizo omelette with home fries. So good. It was essentially a breakfast burrito in an omelette! My wife ordered the whole wheat waffle with sausage. Basic, but still great.  Cannot say enough good things about Jordan though. He joked with us the whole time. Even if the food had been bad, the experience would have been good. We will definitely be returning to Cafe 100 in the future."}
{"text":"Brunch. Brunch. Brunch. Brunch.  This place is the best for brunch! That Caf√© Sunrise is one of my favorite drinks. This place is quaint, it's built inside of an old home, it's super cozy, the food is comforting, and there's a little extra pizzazz that makes you know that you are being well taken care of."}
{"text":"So glad I found this gem! Such a wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Recommended the SoCal Omelette. It was very good, fast service, food is quick n friendly service. If i lived closer to here, i would be here at least once a week. Will def come back and the only complaint i had was i wish they served espresso , lattes, ca"}
{"text":"Excellent service that matches the quality of the food!  Welcoming staff and a small town feel!  Wont disappoint!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just had lunch here. What a great staff, environment, and experience. We got the buffalo chicken wrap and Greek salad. It's hard to find a good buffalo wrap that tastes fresh and unprocessed. Yum! We will be back."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in wall that is right up there with Toast and Egg in Davidson. I went at breakfast - 7:30 am.  I like the small home town environment, where everyone is on first name basis.  Eggs Benedict were spot on, with three large slices of very good quality bacon.  By 8:30 am, the place was full.   Staff was hustling.     Looks like they have a regular night crowd, with some great menu items, quality live music and decent specials.  I will plan on trying the dinner menu in the future.  Also, bonus - Wednesday night is $2.50 Any Bottle Craft Beer night.   Yummm!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunches I've had in the Charlotte metro area. The specials are creative and pack a flavor punch. I had a chorizo omelette with jalape√±os and chipotle sauce. The sweet potato and poblano hash was also delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great staff, great fresh ingredients and a neat atmosphere. They always aim to please."}
{"text":"good food ok service. small on inside so only can go on week days to avoid long wait."}
{"text":"The food was great at one point, but here lately it's been slipping. On top of that the service is horrible! For this place to have a descent amount of wait staff, they sure need to retrain their wait staffs. When it's all said and done we just stop going."}
{"text":"They were SLAMMED on a Sunday morning for brunch. I wish I knew how busy they were going to get, would I have made a reservation. We had a party of 2, so we were informed that it would only be a 10-15 min wait time. 30 mins later we were still waiting. I don't really mind since I understood that they were really busy but only thing that bother me was, a couple got here after us and they were given a table way before us. Eventually seated, our waiter gave us bites of cornbread. It was okay, I felt like they could been better if it wasn't so cold. Also I couldn't find the drink list on the menu, so I just ordered coffee, Greek frittata w/ a side of hash browns. So, the food also took FOREVER to come out, but the taste made up for it because it was pretty good! I tried my moms egg & cheese bagel too & I really enjoyed it. Honestly I don't think I would go out of my way to come back, because the service was just okay, the wait time was outrageous, everything was slow & the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Have been here once before and had a great experience... unfortunately not this time. Rude staff, unorganized, was spoken to for sitting down at bar in a rude manner after ordering. Then asked to move. Will never return nor recommend to anyone. Open tables everywhere and told a 30 minute wait. Bar was wide open. We sat down. 15 minutes later reprimanded for sitting there. Left with a bad taste in our mouths that was not from the food."}
{"text":"The food is always great especially the breakfast and brunch. They always have great daily specials to the point we haven't tried much off the standard menu. They have a large outdoor seating area for cool weather."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday for brunch.  Decent menu of usual brunch fare.  The portabella sandwich was pretty good.  Ordered with \"home fries\", which were actually hash browns and were excellent.  The servers were super-personable and did a great job.  Everyone seemed really happy to be there.  Cafe 100 is located where Toast used to be.  The building and layout is generally the same, but they've done a great job sprucing up the inside, adding a new counter and redoing the floors and walls to make it look new.  It's well-decorated with local artwork and serves as a gallery.  On your first time the parking lot may be difficult to find, but all you have to do is swing around the next corner and around the back.  There's a sign and entrance that opens into their outdoor seating area.  The settings both indoor and outdoor are cozy and relaxed.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Best breakfast we have had in a while! Very cute place! Wish it was a little bigger and parking was a little better but other than that a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"A delicious brunch, like reading a great book on a hammock or finding $20 on the ground, is something that can make your weekend go from zero to hero. Hoping that brunch at Cafe 100 would upgrade our weekend, my roommate and I headed there for a mid-morning meal last Saturday, after being recommended by her boss who assured us it was better than Toast.  The best word I can use to describe the experience is underwhelmed. Or if you asked for another word, I'd say subpar. Regardless, you get the jist.  I ordered the breakfast burrito, which for $5, was a pretty good deal. Stuffed with scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, tomato, avocado, peppers, onions and pimento cheese, I could hardly wait to sink my teeth into it. Yet when I did, I was sorely dissapointed. The eggs were bad. Not so bad that they were unedible, just kind of bad. What should have been a flavorful, fluffy delight ended up being surprisingly bland.   My roommate, who ordered french toast, seemed to be even more dissapointed. This was the saddest looking french toast I had ever seen. Never have I seen scrawnier pieces of bread. The only appetizing part of it was the fresh strawberries topping it, which she had to ask be substituted for their strawberry preserves. Our other friend ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, which was edible but forgettable.  I think Cafe 100 deserves 3 stars because while our food was lackluster, to say the least, the atmosphere and coffee were great. The restaurant is located in a cute house, and provides a quaint place to catch up with friends or even just sit to read the newspaper by yourself. I'd be willing to try Cafe 100 again, in hopes that the Chefs were just having an off day, but I'm not sure you could tear me away from my current brunch obsession, Toast. Either way, you should at least give this place a shot, at least to see what it's all about."}
{"text":"Favorite brunch place in Charlotte.  Staff is wonderful, food is always amazing.  Can't say enough about this place.  Everyone I've ever introduced it to keeps going back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a friend and it was very good!  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away! We sat outside!  Both of us ordered the Chicken Cobb salad!  It was huge and delicious! Very neatly presented as well!    I ordered a to go Meatloaf panini with a side of Mac and cheese for my husband at home and he was so impressed!  He stated that it was very good ; even reheated !!   I definately recommend this little place and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Ask for Jay. Enjoy the rest. Oh, and ask for the coffee cake in case they're making it fresh and don't dish it out right when you sit down. Actually, don't go here, that way there won't be a line in front of me."}
{"text":"Visited this place a while back and it's definitely worth checking out. They have all the traditional breakfast options and are able to make healthy substitutions. Their unique thing is this fresh, warm coffee cake they bring to your table as a starter. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at Cafe 100 and it was super delicious! I appreciate a place that doesn't over pack your plate, but gives you the exact amount of food you need. I had the breakfast sandwich with sausage and a side of fruit with the sunrise mimosa - win!! My dad had the day's special omelette (smoked sausage) with a pancake and the same mimosa. None of it disappointed. The biscuit wasn't too floury or buttery. Mimosa legitimately had champagne and vodka in it, and the staff was very nice. When I'm back to visit, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely everything I have ever tried here has mad me wish the food would keep coming! Amazing food! love every Eggs benedict special i have tried! You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 pairs a vibrant and personable wait staff with a kitchen that consistently prepares delicious food. The SoCal omelette with home fries is a personal favorite for brunch. The sunrise mimosa is delicious, unique, and generously served. There is a covered deck with additional seating available on a brick patio. Great summertime brunch spot!"}
{"text":"YES!  Super awesome brunch experience this past Sunday!  We arrived around noonish - Cafe 100 was bustlin' but we were seated within 5 minutes after asking for the first available table.  We had a nice outdoor table, and despite the increasing heat, the shade helped a lot and it was nice to carry on conversation.  Our server was HILLARIOUS and so entertaining!  Go on Sundays or Thursdays (AM) for a great experience :)  ANYwho, the food was JUST AS GREAT as the service!  I had one of the specials (OREO PANCAKES, need I say more???) and my tablemates loved their choices as well - pb/banana french toast, chorizo omelet, breakfast burrito - and the coffee was also quite fantastic.  Wish we had a Cafe 100 where we live!!"}
{"text":"Cool little place. Once again found them on Yelp. Tucked back in huntersville. I had the Reuben sandwich and pasta side. Both were very good but the Ruben could use a slice or two more of pastrami. The only reason for the 4 and not a 5. Service was great. Check it out if in that area you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I give it 5-stars for it being a brunch place (haven't tried it in any other capacity).  I had the southwestern omelet - tortilla strips are a great addition to an omelet.  Loved it!  My boyfriend had the So Cal omelet, also great.  Fruit was fresh, home fries were tasty.    Service was great!  Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is a cool place in Huntersville.  We have been there a few times, once for breakfast and most recently for lunch.     This time we had the Cuban and Club.   I had the Cuban and it was pretty good.  The one thing that really impressed me was the ham.  I know that you must be shaking your head but it was really thick (not just the ordinary lunch deli meat).  I think that it was a nice touch and goes to the quality.    We were going to try the seasonal cobbler but just forgot.  Just another reason why we will be coming back to Cafe 100  All in all this is a great little spot to eat.  I really like to support local businesses and will continue to come here.  You should too."}
{"text":"The food never disappoints! I was looking forward to trying their coffee with breakfast this time around but I honestly didn't like it. They also don't have any fresh juice options. I guess I'll have to stick with water and alcohol here."}
{"text":"Had a quiche with my friend at Cafe 100 and will definitely bring my husband to this place! What was amazing is the fact that we could call ahead 10 minutes in advance and we walked in to a table that had a \"reserved\" sign for us!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great atmosphere. I love the art on the walls as well! I had excellent macaroni salad here and a sandwich. It was great"}
{"text":"The best crab benedict ever. I usually need hot sauce or some kind of spice on my Benedictus but this was just so perfect that I did not have to add any other thing at all. Went there for Easter brunch and was very happy with my experience. Although it was busy I could get a table on the porch wit my friends. The caprese Benedict and portobello sandwich were great too."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Mimosa sunrise is Th a bomb. I had the hash special. Friends had omelets, and pancakes. Everyone really enjoyed everything.  We will return"}
{"text":"Really nice breakfast in a quiet street. We enjoyed a good omelet and some excellent coffee."}
{"text":"This is a nice local place, with local flavors. However the service is terrible disorganized and slow (30 min to sit down and almost 40 minutes to get the food) with hungry kids this is terrible. This is a much better option than Lupie's next door for sure. They also allow you to bring your dog if you are sitting outside, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, cozy setting, and good music. I had the breakfast burrito, and it was really good. Full of flavor and very filling. My husband also had a burrito and a waffle, and he ate every bite. We arrived just before 10am on a Sunday and had now wait. The line started to build up at the door right around 10. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pros:  Friendly staff.  GREAT food. Cons:  Small building.  Long waits (depending on when you get there) and a shared parking lot -- sometimes hard to find parking."}
{"text":"The parking was very weird and there was a wait time for a table. We had the blackened shrimp omelette special and french toast. The blackened shrimp omelette was just okay...I was not a fan of the chill sauce that was on top. The french toast was delicious. But most of all the sunrise mimosas were awesome. I would go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Large mimosas for the win!! Amazing brunch spot with delicious food! Always a wait so make sure to get there early or call for a reservation."}
{"text":"If you want some good eats, come on over to Cafe 100 formerly known as Toast cafe in downtown Huntersville. This place is in a house located just past discovery place on Gilead road. The breakfast here is always on point. The pancakes are light fluffy and delish, they also serve a good turkey sausage which I like! the biscuits are fluffy and good as well. We had a long wait on the day we had breakfast so when we were seated they brought out baskets of complimentary baked coffee cake.  The paninis are always on point as well as the club sandwich . Be forewarned the turkey club is huge and is done in a stacked style then held together with a large pick so it seems you are gettingb2 sandwiches instead of 1"}
{"text":"I love this place for a weekday lunch. The food comes quick, everything is fresh, and they have decent (healthy-ish) kids options. However, we went for a sunday brunch, and my husband refuses to go back, even though he loved the food. There was a huge crowd waiting to be seated, so we were going to go elsewhere as we had a hungry toddler, no big deal, but the manager said the wait was only 20 minutes. Perfect. I assumed the wait for food would be comparable to what we experience during their weekday lunch rush hour. Well, after being seated very quickly for such a large crowd waiting, we realized that they have way too many tables for what their staff and kitchen can accommodate.   I asked to order right away as we knew what we wanted and was told we had to wait for other tables first and the waiter could only take drink orders. Ok. Then we waited for our orders for 15 minutes, then waited another hour or so for the food to come out. I understand they must cook things to order, but they should be up front about what they can handle. Never received a drink refill over the 2 hours or so we were there. The paying structure is just as frustrating. Already annoyed, my husband went in to pay (as the waiters do not take care of it for you), and waited another 30 minutes in line to pay the ticket. This is insane. It would be so much more customer-friendly to have the waiters take care of it as they have time, so guests can stay at their table enjoying their meal rather than have to stand in an overcrowded area where waitstaff is trying to squeeze by with platters and people are in line for the bathroom.   This restaurant is in a cute house (with overflow seating outside on a nice porch, and I've never been disappointed with a lunch there, so I might continue to go occasionally with my toddler before a weekday visit to Discovery Place Kids (which is within walking distance), but it looks like we won't be returning on a weekend or in the evening as my husband still remembers it weeks later and refuses to patronize them.  Oh, one day during lunch, my 3 year old and I witnesses a huge fight between two middle-aged women at the table inches away from us, in which there was loud cursing and whatnot, and one stormed off from the table. Awkward, and it took every tactic I could think of to distract my kid from the scene."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  We came in on a Saturday morning and there was a line of people waiting to be seated (that was a good sign...good food is worth the wait). Once seated we were served a small plate of fresh homemade coffee cake. The selection was great. The food was delish!  The dining area was small and comfy. The service was exceptional,  especially considering how busy they were.  We would def come back :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on a busy and rainy Saturday morning. Was offered coffee during the wait and soon we were seated inside - there were tents. My dining companion ordered a Virgin Mary (waitress seemed surprised) but no problems, and the special omelette. I also ordered an omelette and it was quite good. Will definitely return - looking forward to trying lunch.  There might have been a downfall for our fellow diners as my dining companion is an extremely loud talker. The woman next to us kept her fingers pressed over her ear but did not complain. If she reads this - I'm sorry!"}
{"text":"My family and I just moved into the area and we love Cafe 100. The owner is super nice and so is the staff. We LOVE the breakfast, lunch and dessert menu. Dinner is OK."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot different from the prior tenant (Toast). Menu was very similar. My particular dish wasn't all that great, but the others at my table looked good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Amazing yogurt and granola and the health nut turkey sandwich doesn't taste 'healthy' at all!"}
{"text":"Had it not been for the painfully long wait I would give them a 5 star - we were sat almost immediately but everything took forever from then on.  It was at 10 to get our beverages after ordering and a good 25 minutes or so to get food.  We had to ask about the complimentary coffee cake too!   The only thing they were prompt serving was my grandsons order of French Toast n Turkey  sausage and we are thankful for that!   The hubby and I ordered the quiche of the day which was spinach artichoke n goat  cheese with fresh fruit (the variety was great) and a  side salad! The portions are generous and everything was very good.  Our daughter ordered a chicken wrap with home fries the potatoes were mushy instead of crispy but other than that no complaints.      They should consider options for controlling the flies too as they became a distraction while trying to eat outside   Our waitress was attentive but frazzled nonetheless!  Ambience is organic and family friendly"}
{"text":"I went to Cafe 100 this morning for a brunch with some girlfriends. We had a reservation and our table was ready for us on time despite them being busy. The table service good and we had an averagely attentive waitress. I am not able to have gluten, so I was thrilled when I saw they had gluten free pancakes on the menu. Once the pancakes arrived they looked great, but they tasted like straight cornmeal. They were dense and not fluffy and they kind of crumbled apart like cornbread when I tried to cut them. Another girl in our party got the pancakes as well and felt the same way. Everyone else seemed pleased with their breakfasts, so I would recommend getting something other than the GF pancakes."}
{"text":"Saying I'm disappointed is an understatement. We came here with such high expectations from previous reviews that we expected to find our newest breakfast spot only for it to fall short.   We ordered the Lox bagel platter, the southwest burrito, and a side of biscuits and gravy.  The waiter assured us the portions were fair and plenty so we felt secure in our decisions. Once our food arrived it was certainly not what we expected (see pictures below).   My burrito was most tortilla, and I only tasted 2-3 slices of sausage, no bacon, and 2-3 potatoes. While the eggs were really dry and over cooked. All in all I won't order it again.   The Lox platter was pitiful, it was barely enough salmon to make 1 half of a bagel. They make it seem as though it's enough and comes with several halves, when it's only 1 bagel. Kinda annoyed with that as well since my boyfriend is from the PNW and loves Smoked Salmon. This was a sad excuse for a Lox \"Platter\".   I want to give them another chance but I'm not sure exactly when we'd be back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast as an out of towner, recommended by a local. Basic entrees, wasn't bad, wasn't necessarily good. My biggest gripe is the outdated system - check was hand written on notepad paper. 2 waters, 2 meals at $8.95, and somehow the bill came to $22. How much tax are they charging!? It would be unusual to include gratuity for a 2 top and not say so. When we went to the register to pay the total increased to $23 and change. Next time I'm in town I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we did not get to try the food and we probably never will. The sign said \"come inside to be seated\", even though there was tpms of spacd and empty tables outside, so we went inside. It was very crowded, there wasn't really a place to stand and wait, and there was no hostess stand nor anyone that was greeting incoming people or taking names. We waited 5 stressful minutes, while servers navigated through and around us, none greeting us nor saying excuse me. Then the people next to us were approached by a woman (hostess?) and taken to be seated outside. When she came back in we expected to be greeted, but no, and I even said \"hello\" in hopes to get her attention. Nothing. People waiting to be seated were crowded in this small place, hovering over people who were trying to eat. More people came in and found some empty spot wherever they could. None were greeted. Finally, I told my fiance we should go somewhere else, and THEN a random waiter tried to stop us and said, \"Did you not get greeted?\" I told him, \"No. We have been here 5 minutes being navigated around in this tiny place, no greeting. We are over it and we won't be back.\""}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time visiting here as i love the place. The mimosas were delicious. My first visit the omelet was delicious. This time i tried the stuffed French toast, it was just ok. When i think of stuffed French toast i think of cream cheese and fruit. This French toast was just stuffed with jam, which made the bread soggy. Other than that the service as excellent and our other food and drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"THE BEST drinks and food for brunch. Ahhhhh. I just wish the friendly staff had a host to help them out so they can focus on being themselves and providing quality service (which they always do, I just wish it were an easier time for them!)"}
{"text":"Food was okay nothing special. The setting was nice we ate in the courtyard. Flies are a major nuisance, seemed to be plenty of those.The reason for the 1 star rating is the size of the kids portions.   All my children ordered the the kids french toast with bacon priced at $4.25. The portion was a single slice of bread, not a thick cut challah size but rather a thin cut slice of wonder bread. When we mentioned this to the manager he stated that they serve children all the time with no complaints."}
{"text":"so good! A nice little variation of \"Toast\" that used to be in this location.  It can get pretty crowded and it is in a small house so there are not many tables.  They do have seating outside.  I had the french toast and it was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Perfect brunch spot! Great atmosphere and delicious food! Service was timely and pleasant. The Ahi Tuna + wasabi mashed potatoes & broccoli were outstanding at our most recent visit. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is a quaint and secluded restaurant/art gallery nestled in the heart of downtown Huntersville. What a great home like atmosphere with a family owned and operated system. The food is well prepared and properly served with attention to detail. 5 stars all around!! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! Lots of healthy options and they have turkey bacon! Coffee was great.  Only suggestion is call ahead and make reservations if possible can get busy on the weekends. It's a popular place for brunch. They do have outside seating which is a bonus! Cute staple for awesome brunch and fun mimosas:) Service was great even though they were slammed!"}
{"text":"We'd eaten here before and really liked it, so going back we didn't expect some of the worst service ever. Waited at least 10 minutes for the waitress to arrive for the drink order. Obviously after 10 minutes we'd had plenty of time to consider our selections, so we told her we were ready to order. She said others had priority over us, and that we could order once she brought the drinks. 15 minutes later our two coffees, and three waters arrived. So now we were 25 minutes into sitting down before our order was taken. Looking around, we saw people around us who came in after us and already had their food. But we had been told that we couldn't order our food when she was taking the drink order. ???? Really???? The food was ok, not as good as our previous visit. kinda cold. And skimpy on the hollandaise.  My wife has a hispanic accent, but speaks good English. The waitress had an unusual difficulty in understanding her, and appeared to be put off by by it. Awkward and weird.  In case management reads this, its been over two months since that visit, and I don't remember the waitresses' name. She is short and has glasses. And it was August 5th.  I understand some inconvenience because the place gets busy. But it would be better to not seat some one, rather than seat them and then render such a horrible experience. At those prices. NO BUENO!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times but only for brunch. As far as the food, it's always been outstanding. Fresh breakfast servings with varying daily specials and usually a couple drink specials.  I had the PB and banana French toast last visit. Very tasty and prices very reasonably. They also have a small bar and TVs inside to entertain.  My only complaints are sitting outside during nice weather. Always seem to be harassed constantly by flies and bees. The wait can get a little long, especially on weekends but the food for me is worth it. Parking can be a little tight but always able to find a space. Otherwise I enjoy this place. Always good food."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go brunch on Sundays! Even though we live in the university area of CLT, we always make a special trip here about once/month. Food is amazing and service has always been wonderful! The only thing I will say is that it gets REALLY crowded and it's a small space. Would be great if they could expand their dining area into one of the back buildings! ;)"}
{"text":"Pros: Banging mimosas w/vodka  Cheap Delicious daily specials Great service   Cons: None  When I'm in Charlotte, this is my go-to for brunch. And not just because it's 2miles away from my best friends house. I love it for their drinks and food.   Set in a quaint little house on the corner in downtown huntersville, cafe 100 serves up breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I've honestly never had a menu item because their daily specials are always to die for. So be sure to read the board or ask what they are! I know they have dishes ranging from breakfast burritos to burgers. So whatever your taste is, they have it.   Last time I was here, I had the Cajun shrimp omelette- delicious!! Tons of fresh shrimp. Not to mention my side order or mac and cheese.....drool. Just beware- other people love Cafe 100 just as much as I do, so get there early to avoid the crowds.   Free parking in the back- drive slow or you might miss it!"}
{"text":"My first time here was so fun and yummy! The coffee cake is worth a visit in itself. I opted for their biscuit and gravy and wasn't disappointed. The place is a house turned cafe so it goes without saying it has a \"homey\" feel to it. Sitting at the bar was entertaining and service was prompt. Their playlist was also bomb. Can't wait to return here!"}
{"text":"The food here is always high quality and very tasty.  It's a little bit of close quarters inside.  Try to sit outside for a little more elbow room."}
{"text":"We come here every time we visit the area, maybe 3-4x a year. Breakfast is served until 2:30PM, that alone makes it a reason to go. The food is delicious, fresh, hot, and made-to-order. The Greek Fritatta is excellent. Bloody Mary's also delicious, garnished with a dilly pickle as well as lemon and lime. There is dog-friendly outside seating."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast and lunch place in a converted single story house,  tasty food, and pretty good service. Went here for a Sunday brunch with the kids, it was busy but not crowded, and were seated within 10 minutes but I imagine wait times could be much higher. I had the Eggs Benedict Caprese, which was very tasty with the fresh tomato and basil paste, but over easy eggs were a tad too done. My wife made her own breakfast burrito with bacon, onion, tomato and cheddar cheese, very tasty. My son had a burger that was actually pretty good. Home fries (i.e., hash browns) were a little mushy and over seasoned. Coffee was diner quality and I think they could really stand to upgrade on that. Server was busy but pleasant and she did check on us once or twice. Overall a really nice experience."}
{"text":"Best casual dining spot in Huntersville! Menu is unique, staff is friendly, owner is present and has great energy. An affordable and delicious option for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Yet another successful dining experience at Cafe 100. I took a friend there for her first time. She had the quiche of the day, which was spinach and Asiago, with a side of fruit and grits. I had the Asheville omelet with fruit and wheat toast. The toast was a multigrain bread and it was perfect. The omelet is full of spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms with a delightfully tangy goat cheese for a little zip. My friend's quiche was fluffy and delicious. The service is quick and friendly. You can't go wrong with this restaurant. Haven't had a bad meal in my 8 years of living in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Wait here is ridiculous, the place is so small make sure your not hungry she you come, I came here once and liked it (my husband thought it was mediocre, I had Belgium waffles, he had omelette) I had been asking him to come here again for a while, we finally did, and of course it was upsetting after waiting 40 min and still no table so we left, mad ..hungry and disappointed with ourself for choosing this place"}
{"text":"Update update!!   Had to back to Cafe 100 today...I just can't get enough. Got there a little early and was able to cop a squat in the rear dining room. Wanted to get breakfasty type foods so I had one of the many daily specials, the spinach and cheese quiche with fruit, and a smalled tossed salad (which I exchanged for yogurt and granola). Great texture, portion and flavor on the quiche. I think this is going on my Huntersville fave list! Holding out on the last star until I can check them out for dinner Fri/Sat nights. They have wine and live music...my kinda scene!"}
{"text":"I was so distracted by the aroma wafting up from the pale tanned biscuit that right after trying to get a picture of the steam rising up from the filling I stuck a spoonful of near-boiling blueberry goodness in my mouth. Ouch, but yeah, it smelled that good...  MLB and I came in during restaurant week and found that we liked it anyway. Got in earlier than our reservation on Thursday night and were seated immediately, got menus and water and asked for crab cake app to start. We were greeted by a sauced-up crabby patty on a field of greens that would make Sponge Bob proud. For mains I had the ravioli: Delectable and respectable dish of miniature italian cheese sandwiches topped with tiny tomatoes and asparagus and blackened chicken bits, breads heavy with garlicky butters on the side. MLB had the quiche: Warm smooth creamy eggs plus roasted veggies and cheese with fruits and greens on the side. A small fire out the window and a little malbec made for a nice evening out save for the small disappointment when we heard there was no peach cobbler... we settled for blueberry and I think this is where I started"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my family today.  The ambiance was clean, cozy,  and inviting. We ordered and waited awhile when the server told us she forgot to turn in our order. She apologized profusely and said our order would be expedited and comped. The food arrived shortly thereafter and was amazing. I have waited longer for food that was not as good.  I have never found an honest server before this!  This place takes their service seriously!  Quality and class. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Great value and local atmosphere. Definitely recommend checking it out. Brunch is top shelf.  Dinner is above average."}
{"text":"Before I start my review, to be fair, before my last visit I would have given this place 3 stars. I've been here twice, both times for breakfast. The food is mediocre, I have had a much nicer breakfast at plenty other places in Charlotte. I don't know how the service in general is, because both times we had the same server and more on that later.  The first time when me and my boyfriend went to Cafe 100, it was a nice day so we sat outside. Our server came over to take our order. I asked for a Latte without whipped cream, but when it arrived it was topped with whipped cream. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it since they ordered it from the coffee shop next door so I just asked for a bowl and scooped it out. The main reason why I didn't want to make a big deal was that our server didn't seem too interested in serving us without as much as a smile on her face so I decided to keep a low profile till I found out how the food in their kitchen was. Our food took almost 25-30 minutes to get to our table but again, it was a very nice day so we were generally in a good mood and didn't mind it. The food was alright, extremely mediocre, but not bad. Our second visit was two weeks back when we went to Cafe 100 for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We sat on the patio and when we got there, the place was packed with all tables occupied. We had the same server as last time, with that same depressing grumpy and irritated look on her face and lack of smile which made me uncomfortable and intimidated during our first visit. They usually serve free coffee cake which we didn't get. When I asked for it, it took more than 10 minutes to get to our table, by when I had already finished my coffee. I ordered an omelet and my boyfriend ordered scrambled eggs. People around us got their orders, some people who ordered after we got there even finished their food and left. Still our (simple to make) food did not arrive. After what felt like almost an hour, I decided to ask our server, who conveniently 'didn't notice' us even after waving to her while she was at the table next to us. The manager noticed us and came over just as I was getting up to go talk to someone inside. He said that our order was mistakenly taken to another table and that they were getting ours now. I told them to cancel the order, but he said it's ready. Not wanting to create a scene, we sat down and about 10 minutes later our food arrived. For those of you who care, I timed the order and it took 72 minutes for our breakfast to get to our table. In 72 minutes, I would have made 8 batches of omelet and scrambled eggs, and it is not even what I do every day!  This is one place completely blacklisted on my list of to-visit places and recommendations."}
{"text":"Very small, quaint place. Great for a date night or for brining out of town guests. Sophisticated menu that pleasantly surprises you. Everything is homemade. Warm rolls while you wait for dinner. Oreo cheesecake was great."}
{"text":"Tried the waffle with raspberries and whipped cream. The raspberries were more like jam, the whipped cream kinda runny. The sunrise cocktails are hella strong - make sure you're not the one driving when you order one. Somehow we each had a $20 breakfast with tip! You only live once, what can I say?"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since my last review...I had to make sure the good experience after the not-so-good experience wasn't a fluke...and it wasn't! I've had exceptional service every time I've been since then and the food has always been hot and fresh. The latest meal consisted of chilequiles w/ fresh avocado and cotija, the enchilada burrito, a kids serving of pancakes, some fresh fruit and some home fries.  The outdoor deck/patio is perfect on a spring/summer morning if you can beat the heat. Very homey, neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"We ordered to go food here and they were able to deliver it to the Main St Tavern across the street. The turban and mixed green salad were great. The order was ready fast and tasted fresh. Wish we lived closer to go more often"}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE cafe 100. Yes there will always be a bit of a wait, but the food and service is worth it. The beauty of the design of the restaurant and southern hospitality is surrounding tables end up starting conversations and it turns into a whole family feeling. Helps that my 1year old is a good way for strangers to say hi. So for us when we come for brunch it's like going to a friends house, and to me that is one of the most important things to find in a restaurant and community. Plus! No where else can you find such a delicious and lofty quiche"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with my mother for breakfast.  For a weekday, it was pretty busy.  I was shocked at how cute and homey this place was, not to mention pristine.  Our server, Lisa was awesome.  Being that it was our first time, she was patient and explained all of the breakfast specials.    I ended up ordering the egg white burrito with the fruit cup side, and my mom the two egg breakfast platter with both turkey and pork sausage and home fries.  Coffee was great and they made sure to keep your cup full.  Everything was custom made, not mass made like a Denny's or Bob Evans type place.  The burrito was huge, hot and so good, I couldn't finish it and ended up taking the other half home.    I really enjoyed my visit here, though I imagine on weekends the crowd will be enough to keep me away.  But for my money, I will definitely be going back to Cafe 100.  Stupendous!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Cafe 100 a handful of times for breakfast and I am never disappointed. Good food and the waiters/waitresses are always great. Cool atmosphere inside, like you are eating inside a friend or family member's house. Pancakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and brunch spot. Weather was perfect on a July morning, so we sat outside. Very pleasant service. Good coffee. Good selection of kids meals. My breakfast enchiladas were just OK, but my wife's Greek salad wrap was amazingly delicious, with feta, olives and hummus. There were other tempting Greek style options as well."}
{"text":"I really don't see the big fuss over this place. My food was so mediocre. I got eggs? I think? I can't even remember since it was such forgettable food. No bueno. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Parents were in town and decided this would be a good place to take them for breakfast. We called ahead on a sunday morning and had a very short wait.  They provide free coffee outside while you wait to be seated as well. The tables are very close to eachother and the restaurant is small but i think thats what makes this place what it is.  I ordered eggs Benedict and was thoroughly pleased. My dad ordered a breakfast burrito and he was extremely satisfied as well. Service was great and our waiter was very personable. Will definitely be back and am looking forward to exploring the menu."}
{"text":"My sister and brother in law eat here weekly on Sunday.  We come up to visit and we love the breakfast.  Service is always good. Coffee cake starter for all tables is brilliant.  In the nice weather you can eat outside and bring well behaved dogs."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on the reviews but sadly it was just ok. I got the special for brunch which was a ham Benedict with sausage gravy. The ham was nothing but fat, hardly any meat and the gravy was sub par. I did enjoy the sunrise drink I had but overall everything was average. Super disappointed! :/"}
{"text":"Food is always amaze balls! But the service is always lacking unfortunately! The manager is great, but the servers we encountered have always been a little too frazzled to be great!"}
{"text":"In town briefly and hotel desk reco'd this spot for breakfast - awesome food and great staff. Had the southwest burrito and my wife had the benedict caprese - both were delicious. Our waitress Theresa was a hoot!  We enjoyed ourselves so much that we may come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Living up in northlake this is my favorite breakfast place. With fresh breakfast that tastes like it was made at home. Can't do breakfast much better than this."}
{"text":"Litlle place in downtown Huntersville that many people don't know about but should. Great menu and daily specials. Breakfast was outstanding. Nice artwork hanging on the wall. All in all this is a great spot to eat."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! My favorite meal is breakfast, and theirs is great. My husband had the Southwestern Burrito, with a red chili sauce to die for! Love the daily specials, but you have to get there early as they do sell out. We brought our three year old and he loved their silver dollar sized pancakes. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning after attending a nearby attic sale. We were greeted immediately and decided to sit outside on the patio. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, offering suggestions for popular dishes and her personal faves. I ordered the crab cake sandwich and the home fries. When it came out, I was concerned that it looked like it was going to lack crab and be mostly filling. I was AMAZED when I bit into it and there was so much crab meat! I demolished my sandwich and was sad to see it go! The home fries left more to be desired. The potatoes were a little over cooked and spicier than I like. I will definitely be back but won't order the home fries as a side. The prices were reasonable and the food came out faster than expected!! I would recommend this cafe to anyone but get there early!! It gets crowded quickly but is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after fasting for my annual physical. I was warmly greeted into the cozy space from the rainy, snowy, cold winter day in progress outside.   I took a seat at the bar and ordered their signature mimosa which is a mash up between a mimosa, hibiscus and screwdriver and packs a punch. Definitely delicious though.   I opted for the crab, tomato, parmesan and scallion quiche of the day with a whole-wheat, strawberry-topped waffle. After sipping down my signature cocktail about halfway, my breakfast arrived.   I tackled the waffle to start. Very good flavor but it should be noted that the waffle isn't Belgian style so it's a bit more dense which was fine by me. The whipped cream was definitely a cool whip-type of which I am not a fan. I also couldn't tell whether it was the powdered sugar or the syrup but there was that weird aftertaste characteristic of fake sugar. It gave the dish a strange taste but I was able to move past it out of sheer hunger. The strawberries were fresh but tasted like they were sliced and left open in the fridge which made them taste like the other things with which they were stored.  All these things together sort of dampened the waffle experience for me but may not be noticeable or of concern to others. I admit my palette is a bit sensitive.   The quiche was the star of the show. Perfectly seasoned, fluffy egg and tons of crab meat. The scallions and tomatoes paired perfectly with the delicate crab meat and the crust was buttery. The parmesan created a crust of its own atop which made for a perfect complement.  The staff were great from start to finish.  My breakfast of solitude was enlivened by the banter of local regulars and newbies alike. All in all a great experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Jay runs a great restaurant and I have NEVER been disappointed. The Cobb salad is my go-to. Best salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"Cafe 100 took the spot formerly occupied by Toast in Huntersville and yes, their breakfast menu is similar and many of the staff are the same. It's also a bit small (hence Toast's move), but they make that small space very cozy and welcoming, and we really like it.  The food, service, and prices are fabulous! And don't forget to check the specials board upon arrival. There are lots of selections, like specialty omelets, quiches, burritos, and seasonal pancakes. I've tried a lot of things, but my favorites rotate between the quiche-of-the-day, breakfast enchiladas, and make-your-own-burritos. Their salsa is homemade and delicious. Their black beans also taste freshly made. You can even get biscuits and gravy as your side - how about that?!   The coffee is also better (and a bit stronger) than at Toast.  I was disappointed to hear, though, that the coffee shop they partnered with for espresso drinks had gone out of business.  Cafe 100 now offers dinner from Wednesdays through Saturdays.  Their selections include sandwiches (my favorites are the crabcake, Cuban, and club), dinner entrees (like ribeye, crabcakes, pasta), and of course, their specialties of the day.  I'm not a sandwich kind of gal, but theirs are truly delicious.  Just try one, and I'm sure you'll be back.    They also offer drinks, including wine, beer, and cocktails.  Their martinis are huge and a great bargain at $6.  But my favorite is the mojito (also just $6).    Every server there is super nice and always willing to help -- even if they are not responsible for your table. They also know how to keep people moving through so the wait is never very long (without making you feel rushed).  My hubby and I really like this place, and we go back often.  Cafe 100 is one of my absolute favorites for breakfast and a casual dinner!"}
{"text":"I come here on some Saturdays with the girls from BurnBootCamp... we love it! It's a small place and usually crowded but they find a way to accommodate our larger group. The service is good and super friendly!  On to the food... I LOVE the SoCal omelette. But here are lots of good choices and egg white options are offered. It's just an all around good place."}
{"text":"They ignored us for literally 15 minutes before we went up to a waitress and put our order on ourselves! Totally ridiculous service."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place around here by far!  Great omelets, burritos, and great people!"}
{"text":"I was extra happy with my meat lasagna.  It comes with a side salad and garlic bread.  It was delicious! The sauce was good, the meat, everything done perfectly.  I always get excited when I find Italian food that I actually like, because I'm picky.  The reuben sandwich was ok.. the meat was extra thick and a little fatty (not a fan).  The pasta salad was good though.    I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  You can sit inside or out, which both are beautiful.  We chose outside and it was the perfect day for it.  The server was nice and very hospitable.  She checked on us a lot and made sure we had everything we needed.  I was happy to finally try this place and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. The atmosphere is perfect for brunch and I definitely recommend eating outside. One of my Eggs Benedict was slightly over-cooked but the other was perfect. The yoghurt and granola and home fries were tasty. My date loved her black beans side. The only downside is that the service is a little slow."}
{"text":"We love this place! My husband and I joke about how Cafe 100 made us move, but it really is amazing. From the staff to the food its always great. The black beans are amazing which my husband always gets as his side. I usually go for an omelette like the SoCal or the Herb and cheese, but recently I have been in love with the bacon waffle...Yes bacon waffle so yummy!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time recently, and I must say the food was delicious. Plenty of flavor, as well as great portions. Hard to make a decision with so many interesting things to choose from! The staff is very friendly and on top of things. Although normally busy, they do make sure to get you seated as quick as possible. Nice setup, as it used to be a house. I will be coming back for something new!"}
{"text":"Always delicious!!!  Cute atmosphere and friendly staff. I love their breakfast, my husband and I had a delicious spicy chorizo omelet with roasted corn, pepper jack cheese, and jalape√±os ."}
{"text":"We gave this breakfast cafe another chance after the last visit, and they have really stepped up their service and food game!  Got the blackened shrimp omelet, and the shrimp was plentiful & huge.  The food is really good here...The coffee is just ok.  The trick to the good service is coming very early to this restaurant before lots of people show up in the mornings (especially weekends)."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:05 on a Sunday morning. Party of three. Had to wait 25 minutes for a table, which was fine because it was nice out and they have some tables and chairs outside -- one area surrounds a fire pit, which is cool even when not in use.   When we arrived at our table, we didn't really know what to expect, but a crowded restaurant is often a good sign. But after ordering our food, we didn't see our waitress for 35 minutes straight. We almost left. The problem is that we ordered two sodas and had no cash to leave if we wanted to leave. This is a negative for not carrying cash. However, in this case, it worked out.  We received our food five minutes later (after 40 minutes).   My BLT was strong. A BLT is tough to mess up, but it was definitely better than most BLTs thanks to higher-quality bacon. The pickle on the side was super-fresh (something you don't see that often these days), and the fruit on the side was super-fresh.   My wife's Greek salad was excellent. It didn't have red onions like most Greek salads, but she still loved it. I tasted it and was impressed. Once again, very fresh.  My son loved his grilled cheese sandwich and potato chips. Also came with a super-fresh pickle.  Another bonus is the music in the background. All instrumentals and a perfect hybrid of chill and energy. It adds to the vibe.  Cafe 100 isn't a home run due to long wait times (for table and for service) as well as a difficult-to-navigate parking lot. That said, the positives (atmosphere + food) greatly outweigh the negatives.   We will be back. Looking forward to trying the pancakes next time. Spied one on someone else's plate. Looked good!"}
{"text":"Adorable place with cute outdoor seating and delicious food! We ordered French toast and the eggs Benedict. Everything was absolutely delicious and had its own unique flavor. The service was exceptional and they made sure to make us feel welcomed and explain everything on the menu as well as their specials. We will definitely be back! The food was very filling and moderately priced. I usually stick to a healthier breakfast but I decided to order the French toast and fell in love! It was extremely flavorful and not too soggy. I feel like most places have an issue with finding the correct balance on making French toast. This place is great if you are eating alone or want to have a great breakfast with a group of friends. The atmosphere is unique and welcoming. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Good omelette selection with great sides , we had a ranchero , Asheville egg white omelette and lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes as a dessert on an Easter Sunday. The host was very kind enough for us to seat at porch, though it was crowded. Definitely coming back later for those omelette. They give a nice variety with yogurt granola or fruit or biscuit gravy. Very generous meal for us to enjoy. The pancakes portion was too large and scrumptious food."}
{"text":"One star based on the rudeness of a waitress.  We were sitting at the bar and the waitress would hit my wife's purse every time she walked past her. My wife asked her to stop and the waitress answered her rudely. We won't be back. When we go out, we don't wish to get in a confrontation with servers. It's too bad the waitress didn't apologize and instead wished to be confrontational. Thank God for competition. We will patronize other restaurants who know how to make their customers feel welcome."}
{"text":"Out favorite breakfast place. Crowded as heck and tiny house but great device awesome food and good drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday and ordered omelets, took the :50 minutes to get our food, and omelets was ok, nothing to write about!  I will not recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this place about a month ago with high hopes. I haven't had a yelp account until recently or I would have left this review at the time. The food was pretty good, the service however was a bit lacking. Glasses stood empty for the main portion of our meal and food came out wrong. It was fixed, but still. Also upon check out (you pay at the bar) I apparently left my wallet right next to the cash register. Got to the car (not more than 4-5 min) and realized what I'd done. I immediately called the restaurant as I hurried back and the woman that answered didn't seem in any rush to search. She put me on hold for 45 seconds came back and said they didn't have it. I said ok I'll come check. Went in and it was like nobody had seen anything. I had left it literally no more that 7 min prior. The servers seemed disinterested and clearly couldn't care less. It was getting busy and I was pretty much pushed out. I called back from the car and asked to speak to a manager. Wouldn't you know it, the girl at the bar and on the first phone call WAS the manager. Completely unimpressed and honestly angry that something that serious was so not a big deal to them. Will never be back."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. The build your own breakfast burrito is my fave and there's always a great special!"}
{"text":"Cafe 100 is excellent! Good service, friendly and fast and the food we had was excellent. We had breakfast and all 4 of us enjoyed our meals.  We had a. short wait even though they were very busy. There is lots of parking behind the restaurant.  Very quaint in little house in Huntersville. Noticed sometimes they have live music. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Quaint little spot in Huntersville. Very busy on the weekends. I had pancakes and they were good, eggs good, bacon was chewy. This is a nice spot to sit outside at. Inside was very crowded and tables are close together. I wasn't a big fan of paying at the register & having to be that close to the hustle and bustle of servers. It is however a good way to clear tables faster. Will be giving it a try again sometime.  Service was excellent inside. Coffee refilled promptly!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place the food is fantastic, the chef changes the menu often and bring a different style dish...traditional and non traditional gourmet and comfort food.  They have a great selection of wines...so even if you just go try an appetizer and a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG, what a yelp find, and that is just what it was, another gem we found by looking on yelp. The food is great the artwork by local artists is amazing and the staff very nice. The wait was long but well worth it. They were even so nice as to tell us they would put our order in early since my daughter had to make her job and might not be able to stay. Reminds me of the big bean in Portsmouth NH, a must eat there kind of breakfast place. I had the Greek fratatta and I think I'm good, I will have that every time now"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Enjoy the beautiful weather and sit outside or dine inside. Staff is friendly and food is delish. They can get crowded so go early or be patient. Parking is in the back..."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  I hate sounding like a snoot, but coming from Los Angeles, I've had some pretty good  food. I've had some bad food too. I live in a big city so I'm pretty experienced with eating out, in all sorts of environments. I didn't appreciate all the hype the server gave us for the seared Ahi tuna appetizer because it really was not that good. She was like, \"you can't get tuna like this in LA\"...... oh really?   The tuna was not fresh at all, it had a weak sear on the outside, was overcooked on the inside and came with a mediocre slaw and a big pile of salad greens (undressed). I was like, \"who wants to eat this?\" Not me.  I wanted to order a bowl of Gumbo but they were out.  Artichoke dip? Tasted like it was pre-made, not house made. It came with some weak little triangles of store bought pita bread that wasn't even toasted.   My mother in law's Reuben was super dry.  My father in law's Ahi dinner plate was underwhelming with the same smooshy, not so fresh Tuna that I had as my app. It also came with steamed broccoli and it was served room temp. Bleh.  The plus points were that there was nice patio seating, a decent wine list and a nice but overly eager server girl. Other than that, I wouldn't eat here again when we visit North Carolina. It was just barely mediocre and I could've prepared these dishes better myself.   Sorry cafe 101."}
{"text":"My two favorite things to get here is the eggs Benedict (their hollandaise sauce is amazing) and the club sandwhich and chips. I love coming here for a refreshing meal!"}
{"text":"I can look past the food not being as good today (maybe the kitchen had an off day) but I was totally disrespected by the owner. Im still saddened by the way he treated me in front of my kids and I've patronized this place for years. The food was bad, the server I had was all over the place because she had so many tables assigned to her ( no fault of her own) my food wasn't even made the way it was ordered and I didn't get the rest of my order and had to leave for church. Tried to talk to owner Jay and he was very dismissive and snotty. It was uncalled for and very disappointing and unprofessional (and my stomach was still empty)"}
{"text":"We went to Cafe 100 for a girls brunch on a Friday. We started with the Mimosas, they were huge and yummy! All the food was delicious. I stayed with my standard order, quiche of the day. It never fails!   It's a great environment, super friendly and personable staff. This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Lunch today was just what my tummy needed.  I enjoyed a wrap with crab cake, strawberries, pineapples and more fruit, topped with a delicious sauce.  It was sheer delight!  Who knew crab with fruit was a divine combination.  The wrap was served with my choice of a side, pasta salad (spirals with onion, greens, and cheese).  It, too, was delightful.  All in all, it was a beautiful day with a great lunch - and I ate it all!  Service was fast and friendly.  Cafe 100 is a nice, quaint, neighborhood, down-home restaurant with a nice family-style and casual feel.  Check out the menu online; breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  We used to have brunch here every weekend before we moved out of the area.  If they have the sweet potato hash on special ORDER IT!  It isn't part of the regular menu, but they have it on special when it is in season and it is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is hands down my new brunch spot! I took an out-of-town friend here, and I love everything about it. They have a great patio which is perfect for a nice day. The food was delicious (I had eggs florentine) and a drink. I will be back again here regularly with friends. Come early or there is a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night. Went early because it is not a very large place and can get full in a hurry. We were seated immediately as we arrived just after 6:00.   Service was prompt and competent. Our waitress was very friendly and pleasant in every way.   I had the clam chowder and linguini Alfredo with seared tuna. My friend had chowder and the tuna appetizer.   All was very good. My Alfredo sauce could have used a bit more flavor though. A bit bland. The tuna was perfect. Chowder delish.   Very reasonable prices too. Nice to find a place where quality food and service doesn't cost an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"We wanted to find someplace new for a bite of lunch out that would be affordable. After looking through nearby places on Yelp I noticed Cafe 100. The menu looked good, the prices seemed reasonable and it was close by...all the perfect makings for an impromptu afternoon meal.  I will say that parking is a bit confusing at first, since there is no lot visible from Huntersville-Concord Road. We ended up turning down 115 and found a lot there that ended up behind Cafe 100. The place is pretty small, and looks like it used to be an old home. The interior is pretty cramped, yet very homey and feels like a good 'ol place. Seating is a bit more spacious outside (and there was some live music out there at the time) but it was a bit too chilly for us. Despite the crowd there was a table for two available, and the guy at the door told us where it was and we went off to seat ourselves.  The menu makes for some great lunch eats, with a selection of sandwiches, wraps, paninis and salads...most for under $9 a person. Breakfast was also available at 12:30 on a Saturday and had a huge selection such as eggs, french toast and waffles.   I went with the Asian Chicken Wrap ($8.50) that had grilled chicken, lettuce, mandarin oranges and crispy noodles in it with a sesame dressing. The veggies were fresh and I liked the components that the orange brought to the wrap. Also, this thing was huge and I definitely couldn't finish the whole thing. For a side I got fruit salad and it was pretty darn good, with fresh cantalope, honey dew and strawberries.  The missus went the breakfast route and got the Whole Wheat Waffle ($8.) This thing was one GIGANTIC waffle and came with butter, syrup and fruit. The waffle was the perfect consistency with a crisp outside and warm inside.   Despite how busy the place was service was pretty quick. They had an awesome looking dessert menu but we were so stuffed we couldn't even think about it. The waitress had brought over the bill and you pay at the bar area on your way out. The diverse menu makes it the perfect breakfast/lunch/brunch place, and we will definitely be going back in the future!"}
{"text":"So mother and I went out shopping, but first I needed to get my breakfast one. Since we were heading up towards the Lake Norman area, I picked something on the way.   This is a quaint little cafe, great overhead music, and ok staff. The coffee was good, but slow to refill.   I ordered on of my norms - ABC  egg-white omelet. (Avocado, Bacon, Cheddar) with salsa on side, potato's and rye toast.   The omelet was good -- pretty standard and not as fluffy as I prefer, but I did eat it all. The potatoes came out luke warm and the toast cold...   I'd go back, but I doubt my mother would... she ordered the exact same thing, except with normal eggs. She played with her food and made faces... she is the ultimate food snob!   Oh the water was no bueno and they do accept AMEX."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy restaurant, great atmosphere with excellent outdoor seating.  Our waitress was lively and full of energy...no complaints there.   So now for the less than favorable part...The food was average...our omelettes were dry and lacked flavor.  My biggest complaint was the person managing the seating process.  We were told there was a 30 minute wait which wasn't a problem.  After waiting around 45 minutes and observing 4 empty tables we questioned our position on the list, then suddenly something was available.  I was initially really excited about finding this cute little cafe but I was ultimately disappointed."}
{"text":"Our go-to brunch spot since we moved to Charlotte a few months ago. This is a cute little cafe with indoor, outdoor, and tented outdoor (semi-heated) seating. They have an excellent specials menu, and I HIGHLY recommend the eggs benedict and the pumpkin pancakes! Service is great and all the servers are friendly. Dogs are welcome at outdoor seating.  Only downside is that it sometimes takes a while to get a table on a weekend morning, but that's to be expected with any popular brunch venue."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here! I had a wrap and my husband got the filet and we both loved our food. The service was quick and the staff was really friendly. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Quaint little place. Nice Artwork hanging on the walls. I come here for breakfast every time my mom visits. I love that it's so small and cozy. The ambiance makes for great conversations and relax time.  The food is good. I've only had breakfast here.  It's a bit inconsistent at times. Coffee is mostly good but some days it's been watered down way too much where it didn't even taste like coffee. I feel they must have switched coffee brands or something because on my last visit is was just plain awful. The eggs are always a solid A.  I like that they offer turkey sausages and they are tasty. Except on my last visit they had a funky flavor. The food is basic. Not amazing and not bad. Just fine. But I still find myself coming back here because I just love the setting and feel of this place.  The service is always nice, welcoming and friendly.  I do recommend this place, just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Solid food. Everyone was friendly. Team service works. We got the Crab Benedict, Walnut Waffles, Reuben Sandwich, and Burrito Special with Shrimp, cheese, jalape√±os, meat, and red chille sauce on top.   Yum!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go here every Sunday. If you want the best Mimosa in town I highly recommend this establishment. They have the friendliest and most attentive wait staff around. The food is excellent! Always a wait, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The mimosa is a must. I got a Benedict special that I wasn't in love wth, but the mimosa was absolutely fantastic. I would probably go back just for the mimosa."}
{"text":"Always super busy and a wait but the food is good. I can't speak for the whole menu because I've gotten the same thing twice, the caprese benedict, which is very good. I love anything caprese! Give it a try but be prepared to wait, especially on Saturday and Sundays."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and never been disappointed. Even after moving to the south end of Charlotte, I still travel up to Cafe 100 for the whole wheat chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast or the mushroom swiss burger with dijon for lunch. Great brunch place if you want to take people from out of town.   And you MUST order the cafe sunrise!"}
{"text":"We had plates off the daily specials and devoured our food. Ordered the huevos rancheros and blackened shrimp omelette. Ordered the French toast, it was good but our other dishes were better. Very crowded but I can see why!"}
{"text":"Were told a 30 minute wait time. Took more than an hour to be seated and still no food after 2 hours! The food is delicious, but I won't be back any time soon after experiencing this with my 1 year old in tow!!  And to update, we still haven't been back since that experience. One of the closest restaurants to us, but we now go to Famous Toastery."}
{"text":"This is a decent, local spot for breakfast/brunch.  We stopped in on a Sunday during the second morning of two days driving back from a vacation. Hoping for something beyond fast food or a Denny's this was a good choice.  It's a large space and was logically crowded on a Sunday for the usual brunch crowd (in what I perceive to be a smaller town).    We waited a bit less than the 20 minutes we were advised of and seated in one of the rooms of the converted house.  Our waitress was competent, polite, and attentive for the mob of people this place was dealing with.  No complains on speed  or quality of service.   The space itself is interesting and I enjoyed looking at all of the local art on display and for sale throughout the space. Coffee was refilled routinely and the prices were reasonable. I think we spent $25 on coffee and two entrees.   I had a quiche that was actually very good with a salad and some fruit. And my date ;0) - had a sweet potato hash special (something we make at home), he said it was good, so no disappointments either way. Nothing life-altering but a decent local spot for a bite to eat, to avoid the pitfalls of crappy food along the highway."}
{"text":"Awesome little place to eat! I love the outside seating. It feels like I'm eating in a garden. The service was very friendly and attentive. Food wise... AMAZING! Glad we have a place like this close to home."}
{"text":"Glad it took over a year for the owner to respond to my comment....still haven't been back and don't plan on ever going back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after parking and finding out Lupie's was closed for some family vacation time.  I've wanted to visit Cafe 100 for a while now anyway so, all was good.  I found a seat at the bar and was really glad that I did as I was able to feel the hustle and bustle of the kitchen and had a nice view of how things were run.  How things are run is simply stated.... Very professionally.  Everyone was on top of things, what tables needed to be setup in which arrangements, inside/outside, etc.  I wasn't sure whether to order breakfast or lunch and was helped along by the guy running the show behind the bar who outlined the days specials and talked me into the soup of the day, mushroom and bacon, even though I don't like mushrooms all that much!  He let on that he didn't like them but loved the soup and then brought me a small sample before I decided.  What's not to love about that kind of service??  I wound up ordering a cup of the soup and a Cuban sandwich.  The soup was delicious and the Cuban was pretty good with the only downer being the roasted pork on it having a bit too much fat for my tastes.  Flavor-wise however, it was delicious.  Look forward to coming back and trying some of the breakfast items as the Benedict ordered by the person down the bar from me looked delish!"}
