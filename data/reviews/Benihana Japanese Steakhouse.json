{"text":"Good tepanyaki experience but not great.  I would rate 3.5/5.  Food is good but dinner, drinks, tax and tip is $200 lots of options when your at that price point.  I would happily go again if I'm not picking up bill."}
{"text":"What can I say except...  That was one of the best meals I have ever had!!!!  The ladies and I decided to try the Benihana experience out  and it was not only fun but also very  delicious! The veggies, meats and sauces were amazing and our chef and waitress were gracious, helpful and fun.   The only constructive criticism I would have would be for the hostess at the front. She needed to keep us more informed of what was happening without requiring us to ask.   All in all though.... YUMMMM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quality is decreasing. I used to love this place and their unique approach to dining. However, my recent experience was not so great. We reserved a spot at the tapanyaki table on a Friday evening and the restaurant was clearly low in staff. It took 40 minutes for our beverages to arrive and another 20 for the appetizers. When our chef finally arrived, he did not allow photos or videos to be taken!!! Our table was extremely disappointed and he explained to us he likes his privacy. He was rushing everything and served the stir fry vegetables close towards raw. Imagine a plate full of raw onions! The whole table ordered steak, and I found mine very chewy I didn't bother to finish it. My friend asked for medium-well and he received it closer to rare. Over all, I do NOT recommend this place anymore as there are other great places for tapanyaki elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited here 2 weeks ago after deciding to cancel a booking at the CN Tower. Hey, you're paying partly for the view and if the fog's rolled in...   ... so my friend with whom I was visiting booked us in here for an early dinner looking to eat around 6. Thankfully we did because soon after we arrived we could see it beginning to fill up. We were greeted straightaway and seated at one of the furthest tables, a nice quietly efficient server greeted us promptly and provided menus and iced water. At no point did we feel rushed and all the staff were pleasant.   We had a table to ourselves, nice considering we were only a group of two. Our chef, from noting other reviews, was one of a newer intake, attentive and funny with his various little knife drills and tricks. The decor and ambience was pleasant and I'd certainly visit again.   We decided to have souo and to share scallops and steak, both cooked competently. Not the cheapest items on the menu but with hibachi vegetables, rice, sauces, salad and thd entertainment you know you're paying for all that too! Our cocktails were delicious. As a treat and to take out a friend it was great."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner tonight. The service is horrible and the steaks are tasteless. Further the dinner show is one of the worst I have seen, below standards overall."}
{"text":"The meat was decent other than that the food was terrible. Most definitely not worth the money. Expect to wait a very long time for the chef to come to the table. The chef show was terrible! There was no show! So come prepared to not see anything. Unenthusiastic and a complete waste of time.  All in all, not a place I'd come again."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday dinner. Like it is at any other Benihana, it's all about the show. The kids love it, but as the credit card holder, I think this place is too pricey for the average food. Good for tourists and for people who's never had teppanyaki before."}
{"text":"Benihana definitely exceeded my expectation. Food was actually pretty good considering that we got a deal off of travel zoo. Steak was tender and everything was nicely seasoned. For the quality I might considering returning even though at regular price it's a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"I went for Winterlicious 2014 at this restaurant with my hubby. I have been for teppenyaki at Iron Chef Mississauga previously and in comparison , the latter was definitely better. We mainly came for the tricks and performance, but there was hardly any of that. The chef at benihana was pleasant , but I only saw him flip his knife once and create an onion volcano. And that was the end of it. I dont know if the special tricks and performance is reserved for regular clients only !!!! So being a winterlicious customer, my review is poor in terms of performance, and service and food were mediocre. I felt rushed and felt it was not worth the $45 per head. So much hype and it probably didnt live up to my expectations !!!"}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Food is good but not worth the price! Unique experience! Recommend butterfish sashimi $$$"}
{"text":"i've been here a couple of times now and had different experiences.   The first time we wanted to try the teppanyaki grill but got a call the morning of the dinner reservations that the teppanyaki grill were not working but we are welcome to try their a la-carte. too swamped to find another resrevation the day of we decided to go anyways.   The sushi was mediocre for the price especially. We tried the basic rolls and weren't too impressed at all actually.  But still determined to try the teppanyaki grill i went there a second time. They were very accomodating with allergies. Since my husband has a shrimp allergies and the people on our table had ordered shrimp meals, the chef prepared our meal first - greatly appreciated!   He was so quick with his knife - our jaws dropped trying to follow his kill bill moves. The food was okay actually - we tried the tuna steak - shared the plate between us as we ordered sushi as well. The portion was generous and enough food between the two of us. I've had better tuna steak so it was little disappointing.   The whole experience could have been more fun had the chef been more engaging and interactive and no slicing brussel sprouts across the table at my chest does not count sir! its a true story.  Despite the former bad experience with sushi we still tried it. And this time the sushi was fantastic! it was just as great as the sushi at Yuzu! Although a friend swears that the sushi at Fuzen is the best in TO - must try that soon! For the sushi alone it would give this night's experience a five start however based on the inconsistent experience i would have to go with four star. Its a nice overall experience on the pricey side though,"}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago on a Groupon; good deal with an extra 10% off on a promotion they were having that day.  First time at a Hibachi steakhouse, and we had a blast! the server/chef was entertaining, the food was delicious, and the value (admittedly on a Groupon) was pretty good.  Can't speak for the value for money of their regular menu, but we felt our experience was an excellent deal. If you can still find them on Groupon, go for it!"}
{"text":"If each meal cost $25-$35 per person, this would be a decent restaurant. But instead, customers pay around $70, for their rapidly declining service. The Teppanyaki is alright, maybe slightly above your average Teppanyaki. The appetizer (soup and salad) and desserts are only comparable to mid-range Jap restaurant ($25-$40 per person). Most of the waiters however, are rushed, impersonal, and some are even sloppy. We witnessed a waiter dump water or tea onto the floor from his tray intentionally, apparently to clear his tray. The Teppanyaki cooks vary; the new ones are more interactive, but lack the skills. The seasoned ones tend to just keep to themselves..."}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate your birthday, anniversary and any special day in your life! Although it's a little bit expensive for students, but once in a while doesn't hurt much and it's totally worth it! The atmosphere is great, the chef makes great effort to entertain customers while cooking the food in front of everyone. It's a very unique experience to have in Toronto! Also if you go on your birthday/anniversary, the restaurant will prepare a free dessert (either chocolate cake or cheese cake) for you, very good service! I had their cheese cake, I'd say I made the right choice! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got the groupon for two for 99$. With tax and tip came out to be around $130. The food was mediocre and for that price, it was really not that impressive. There's a lot of \"non tepenyaki\" food as part of the group on tepenyaki meal such as edamame, salad, soup, rice, sushi, desert which I though was a waste. In terms of tepenyaki, u get to choose between steak fish chicken or veggie. We got the steak and fish (tuna) which was average.   Definitely not worth the high price. Can get a Lot more high quality food for that price."}
{"text":"Good sushi, but super expensive. The quality was good, but nothing spectacular..."}
{"text":"Your typical Japanese Steakhouse. Yeah, it's cool that they cook in front of you but the chef could have been more interactive with his guests. I've seen better theatrical shows at other Japanese steak houses.   Now for the food. My wife had the chicken teriyaki. It was nice and tender but the flavour was lacking. I had the steak medium rare. It was cooked to perfection, but once again the flavour was lacking. Our appstore were just your typical apps.   Overall I wouldn't come back and would not recommended to my friends. I was somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"We went there today with a Groupon for a full meal and had quite the pleasant experience.  Our waitress (Connie) was very nice and efficient so no complaints with the service as some other recent reviews have mentioned.  Our chef was Jerry and he put on a good show with the usual juggling, volcano onion, etc.   Our food was cooked well and was very tasty and good quality.  The meal came with edamame, vegetable tempura, soup, salad, teppanyaki veggies, steamed rice (we paid extra for the fried rice), ice cream, and your choice of chicken teriyaki, steak, ahi tuna, or veggies.  I got the steak and asked for rare which is what I got.  It was a nice quality strip loin and tasted quite good.  My husband got the tuna and it was a nice size portion and seared properly on the outside but pink inside, he like it.  We were very pleased with what we got and would go back again, although it would probably be with a Groupon again since the place is a bit pricey otherwise."}
{"text":"went here for my boyfriends birthday expecting it to be amazing like the one in NY. oh man were our expectations wrong.  1) the service was HORRIBLE - if you are expecting your guest to fork up that much money for dinner do a decent job serving them. our waitress had nothing but attitude like she hated her job.  2) DONT advertise something if you are NOT going to honour it. I opened the menu to find a \"group on\" dinner menu WITH prices attached and NO mention of having to purchase a voucher. so I decided to show the waitress what I wanted to order and she starting yelling at me saying \"no available, no no no\" so then we called the manager over to ask why it doesn't say in the menu that a prepurchase was required - he said it was common sense. SORRY, if it's not written under the advertised menu than one can only assume is a free for all, such as summerlicious menus.  after we were ready to walk out he choose to honour the deal BUT we had to buy the vouchers from group on, off our phones and we couldn't place an order until the voucher was generated. 8:30 reservations turned into a 10pm dinner.  not to mention the food wasn't that great. I had a better experience in Mexico at an all inclusive a-la-carte."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fun and entertaining service, expensive but please consider where you are eating -- I've always wanted to try Benihana so we decided to go for my birthday. Right before we went over i decided to browse yelp (never do this) and I have to say i wasn't feeling great after reading through some of the mixed reviews. But i had a great time! the food was really good, and i was reminded aside from personal preference, some of yall really do not know what you are talking about. \"different coloured butter\" that is herb butter man. and they use a lot so i don't see how anything was bland? also 80's decor? everything had stylish mid century touches true to the franchise - it felt like an episode of mad men. the steak cuts were marbled and clean, no grizzle or fat. our cook was entertaining and did his job well.   As for criticisms - probably, the ice cream could have been better. I would put black sesame on there instead of red bean. i guess the kappa maki did not look too impressive but if you are ordering that at a steak house that is more on you.   lastly i'll address the cost. this restaurant is like $$$$$. but it is also technically a hotel restaurant (the royal york hotel) not some box unit in a commercial lowrise up in RH/markham. you are going to pay a premium."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews on yelp we decided to go here for a friends birthday party.  Surprised by the cost (main meal $60plus) we though we would at least be served food which was \"out of this world\".   Three out of the ten of us only ordered appetizers, when told extremely rudely by the witness \" we only cook once\" \"you can not order again\" \"Once your done eating you have to leave \"..this was said to us about 2 times.  Upon receiving our meals, we were extremely surprised  to find our food (which majority of us paid $60 plus for) either had no favour or was average. Once we finished our food, the witness came in so quickly to clear our tables and kick us out. This was the one of the worst customer service I have every experienced. You can get the same quality of food at Mall's food court and still reserve better customer service. If your looking for a good restaurant to go to, please skip over this one."}
{"text":"If you don't mind throwing money around for an average meal, this is a great place to do it.  If they would cut the price in half it would be worth what you are getting.  The only real reason to pay for this is convenience and the mild entertainment value it provides.  But surely there are other restaurants in Toronto that offer Teppanyaki and are good."}
{"text":"Food is good, performance not so great. I went towards the end of the night so maybe the chef that did the cooking was a bit tired, he didn't do any tricks but I was very pleased with the food and the service was good. Servers were very friendly and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ate here this past weekend with the Groupon deal. The deal has good value for the amount of food you get. We had the sashimi appetizer and the starter salad which resembled a bento box offering with the carrot ginger sauce. The chicken karaage was not the most flavourful, but also not bad. For mains we had the chicken and steak which came with a fun show from the chef. We were lucky enough to have been tossed a few shrimps from someone else at our table, and those were very tasty, I wish I had ordered it instead! Definitely worth the upgrade. I like the idea of a hibachi steakhouse, but maybe my palate would have been more satisfied ordering off the main menu.  Overall, we had a fun experience here trying somewhere new, but if it weren't for the Groupon to lower the price I don't think that we would return. Benihana should really revamp the space, and maybe dim the lighting a bit so it doesn't have such a cafeteria feel."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious 2018.   Overall the food was very disappointing. Even with the discount we felt like we wasted our money.   Sashimi Appetizer - Salmon was average, Tuna was basically frozen  Hibachi Steak - Veggies were underseasoned and the steak was cooked a medium well as opposed to medium rare which was my specification. So disappointing  Green Tea Ice-cream - Same quality and presentation you would get at an AYCE sushi place  The service was good and that was the only redeeming factor about our dinner here."}
{"text":"We visited Benihana for summerlicious, and i was disappointed.  At first entry, the decor reminds me of 80's restaurant with amber wood and fabric chairs.   The menu was ok- steak or chicken or vegetarian.  Unfortunately , SOOO much garlic butter and oil used in cooking. So much teriyaki used on chicken.   Cheese cake desserts was delicious though. Service was ok, except for a surly gentleman who clears plates. I asked to take my leftovers home, and he actually rolled his eyes before asking another gentleman to wrap it up for me.  Over all, given its name and reputation that goes with it, along with prices, I don't feel it was worth it.  I've had other teppanyaki at a lower cost and much friendlier and tastier"}
{"text":"The price, the price, the price! I couldn't believe it when I sat down and opened the menu. I suspected there would be some tourist gouging due to the locaation, but this was just greed... $10.50 for a Caesar, $9 for a glass of Gretzkey wine? The entrees all come with soup, salad and shrimp but I was a little reluctant to pay 51 for an 8oz fillet.  The theatre of the whole thing is nice and the wait staff are attentive, I just couldn't get over the price, that's really the only thing holding this place back, there is nothing wrong with it per se, just the prices make the experience less enjoyable because you can't help but feel like you're overpaying, and you most certainly are!"}
{"text":"This place is a tourist place. It's fun and playful and the service is great. It's a cute fun date, it's pricey, the food is good. The servings are HUGE! (We only got teppanyaki) I had the vegetables, tofu and tiger shrimp. Excellent, nothing is strongly flavoured or dimensional but it's good food. This isn't a authentic Japanese restaurant, it's a bucket list spot with a entertaining bend."}
{"text":"I've always loved Benihana, so it's cheesy dinner theatre, but I am a fan of anyplace that cooks right in front of me, so I can see exactly what's going into my food.  The Toronto version varies from the US, but is still delightfully delicious.  My husband and I both had the filet mignon and lobster, cooked perfectly..  The sauces are my favorite, a ginger sauce and a light cream mustard one.  Fresh veg, the traditionally light and tasty soup, and the ginger-dressing'd salad complimented the meal.    Great service, as well, I might add."}
{"text":"We were here for Groupon dinner. The food wasn't too bad. We had variety of meat and veg. I truefully won't come again unless someone want me to go."}
{"text":"Interesting name to say the least.  I liked how the menu was clearly displayed upon entering. We arrived kind of late before closing time, but accommodation wasn't a problem, as we ordered take out.  Ordered a bento box (chose chicken terriyaki over beef) and some miso soup.     The miso soup was delicious, and probably one of the best I've tried to date.    The bento box featured an array of sushi, battered veggies, some fruit, battered shrimp, and of course the chicken teriyaki.  Such an array of different flavour was enough to make my mouth water.  Everything was so fresh.  It's enough to make me want to visit again."}
{"text":"Food was only average, and it was definitely over-priced.  The whole point about teppenyaki open table is showmanship , which was not delivered.  The only good thing is that the service was pretty good. Btw, no free refills on soft drinks and no warning about it too."}
{"text":"Tacky, touristy, mediocre food and we were all squeezed into a tiny table.  I had no room to be able to handle my cutlery properly. The worst Teppanayaki experience ever."}
{"text":"We have been to Benihana's in the Fairmont Royal York twice now and both times the food was outstanding! We ordered chicken and filet, because we didn't think the filet could be as excellent as it was on our last trip here. However, we were pleasantly surprised - it was even better. Melted in our mouth good! This is by far the BEST Benihana ever - Michael, our chef, has been there 19 years (most have been there longer) and he was a joy! Very entertaining and informative. We were the only two at our table (early dinner) so it was very quiet and romantic also. Loved that they serve bean sprouts (most Japanese restaurants don't anymore). The tempura vegetables we ordered for an appetizer were excellent also. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Seriously not good... Very disappointed. I used eat here with friends and family. I love teppanyaki, I ordered the shogun 8oz tenderloin with lobster tail. And a chicken teriyaki children meal for my son. The chef tried to crack the egg in mid-air, for the side order fried rice I order, and he winded up cracking us up instead. The egg just splattered everywhere. The volcanic onion rings was another joke that he could not pull off. I have seen this done in the Epcot Japanese pavilion's restaurant and had never seen such failure. The beef was far too salty. I swear I will not be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I love teppanyaki. I love the tricks, I love seeing the random things put into your food, you can try it at home (minus knife juggling) and I love the fun vibe! Benihana didn't really deliver or maybe my expectations were too high going in..  And so follows the tale of my experience...(dramatic music)...  I came here for a  friend's birthday (about 12 of us), so it was a fun vibe already. We got the drinks menu right on time: the prices are ludicrous. I understand that a portion of the price you pay is for the entertainment (juggling, etc.) ...but if I'm going to pay $70+ for a steak, I'm going to Ruth Chris' (awesome steak btw). I opted for the sushi tray, which was mediocre-to-above average sushi, except it cost almost $30 for 6 pieces of sushi: no juggling required here. Of the 12 of us maybe 5 ordered the non-juggling food options, and the servers spend the entire evening eyeing us down ... /sarcasm fun times /end sarcasm.  I will probably not be coming back. It would have been a fun little place to show out-of-town friends, but given the rude behavior.. I'm going to pass.  TL;DR: Slightly above-average food + entertainment. You're paying for the entertainment. Servers co-relate what you spend on how well they will treat your group. Not returning."}
{"text":"I went here for my boyfriend's birthday as he'd always wanted to go to a benihana restaurant.  First, the good:  I had the filet mignon dinner, which came with soup, salad, a shrimp appetizer, vegetables and rice.  The steak was beautifully cooked and melted in my mouth.  The soup and salad were nothing special.  You could tell that they had all been pre-portioned and were just sitting in their bowls until someone ordered a meal that came with salad.  The shrimp appetizer was tasty.  Now, the bad:  While the show was fairly entertaining, I was disappointed that there was little to no interaction with the chef.  He did his shrimp in the hat, the onion volcano and all of the standard tricks.  I was expecting him to interact with everyone around the table a bit more rather than just going through the motions.    For what we got, the price was way too expensive.  I know you're paying for a bit of a show as well, but it was certainly not worth the price we paid.  Further, if I'm paying that much for a show I would expect a little bit more entertainment than what was provided.    Last, the place was virtually dead when we arrived and we had a reservation.  Despite this, it still took them awhile to seat us at our table, so they suggested we wait in the bar area and have a drink.  To me it just seemed like a ploy to get us to spend more money.  Needless to say, after the experience I had there, I will not be going back to this restaurant.  It's not worth the money."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for a causal dinner I have been numerous times in America, but my sister and brother in law haven't. Problem number one how are you gonna have Benihana and not gave garlic butter! I mean that's what I go for. Next you give dry disgusting white rice no chicken fried rice.  The best drink at beni's is a haiku kualata they have a very limited drink menu there was no option. The cook was slow and sone people were done eating before other ppl got there food. The food was good and cooked well Plus the price was double. I think the owners and manager need to go abroad and see what a real Benihana is like!"}
{"text":"I came to Benihana for Winterlicious this year. Like the previous Yelpers have said, it's all about the show. Our chef Jerry was fantastic, the show was awesome while our food gets cooked. We were definitely entertained.   Food Since we came for Winterlicious, we had limited choices as to what to order. I ordered a White Tuna Seaweed Salad, Scallops (extra) with Sirloin Steak and Mango Mosse Dome for dessert.  White Tuna Seaweed Salad: I must say I am really really disappointed. It was merely 3 pieces of white tuna sashimi with a handful of pre-packaged seaweed salad. Nothing is made fresh. I have a picky taste for my sashimi, and I can easily tell the fish is no where near fresh. It's AYCE sushi quality at best. The wasabi they have used is not freshly grind either, it feels like a watered down paste. The fish is soggy and watery. I did not like it at all.  Scallops & Steak: One word: Overcooked.  My scallops were cooked first. They were decent sized but it was way too overcooked for my liking. It is not tender and the only thing that made them tasty is the slab of butter they add at the end.  I ordered my steak to be medium rare because I wanted to see the show. It is over cooked for my taste because I like my steak rare, but that might be a personal thing, so I am should not judge on that...But the taste of the actual steak is quite bland, and they strongly encourage you to use the sauce they have provided to eat along with the food. Why? Because it's just...so bland. The portion size is quite good, but the steak itself? Meh. I've had better teppanyaki had AYCE sushi places (*gasp* I know)  Mango Mosse Dome: By far my favourite part of dinner. The Mosse is nice and light, and it is super pretty! No complaints there. My absolute favourite part.  Complementary food: Forgot to mention, the dinner came with a complementary soup, salad and rice. Oh and a green tea with dinner. The soup was way too salty, the salad dressing had a really strong taste (almost bitter) and the rice was nicely cooked. It actually gave me an AYCE sushi feel.   Service: Fast. Streamlined. Everyone had a segregation of duty. They know exactly what they need to do. Almost too well...so well that no one realized my water was empty until half way through the dinner. They refilled it once and never again. Even though there are quite a few servers running around, none of them pay attention to the tables that are already seated. We had to track them down if we wanted anything. And, I didn't like the fact that couple minutes after we finished our dinner, our bill came. We were planning to stay maybe a few minutes more and maybe get a second dessert, but guess not.   Overall Impression: If it wasn't for the dessert, they probably will score a 0/5 in the food category. If it wasn't for the awesome chef, they will score a 2/5 on the service at most. The food was no where near the price it's worth, the service was rather pushy, with a mandatory 15% tip was added as well...even though it's not a lot, and as terrible as it sounds, it discouraged me from tipping more for the chef for the show.   If you have never seen live Teppanyaki, go see it for the experience. Our chef was quite the entertainer and made our table's night. But if you expect nicely cooked quality food, please go somewhere else 'cause you ain't finding any here."}
{"text":"An overpriced establishment with mediocre food. The show was great and all but service wise, not so great.   The only good thing about this location and it's downtown core, it wasn't busy so it was able to host a large party."}
{"text":"Short answer - We won't be back. The server was awesome, teppanyaki server was nice, curteous and friendly. But the food quality is not up to my expectation. The sushi was amateurish. Sauces and teppanyaki was so-so. For the amount of money we spent, it is not worth it. It's too bad, the ambience, decor and location is nice."}
{"text":"Might be the second most disappointing Benihana next to the one in London, the food was super bland and the so called garlic butter was a different color and wasn't quite the same as the ones in the states, but I still enjoyed it kinda, I think what bothered me more was the fact they have Every combo except the rocks choice (founder of Benihana) I would recommend it if you really want some fried rice ..."}
{"text":"Came for sushi and not the Japanese fusion menu. It's quite expensive when I compare to sushi I have had at home. It wasn't anything special. Quite standard in quality and decor to any other sushi joint. I expected more considering its in the Fairmont Hotel.   We really only chose it after giving up on other places that had a long wait. This was our first night here.   Suggestion is book ahead ahead Yelpers."}
{"text":"Located in the basement level of the Royal York Hotel, 45-year-old Benihana's used to be a happening tourist trap, but it's popularity has waned over the years.    What most people come here for are the aerial food tricks that the chefs perform on the teppanyaki grill, often flipping and tossing food, catching it with their cooking tools. The majority of the chefs here have been around for about 20 years or more; most of them aren't too chatty but tease them a little and they will probably spice it up for you! And while the show is entertaining and there is no chance you'd leave hungry, this place is by no means affordable for the average Yelper.   The prices start at $33 for the vegetarian saishoku and go all the way up to $59 for a 12-ounce teriyaki steak; you'd be relieved to know that this price does include onion soup, salad, shrimp appetizers, hibachi vegetables and rice. The one thing that I have fallen in love with here is the tempura; the light batter is perfectly exquisite and fairly high quality. Hands down it is probably THE BEST IN THE CITY! I've never had better anywhere else in Toronto!!  Cheaper option for teppanyaki: Yamato's in Yorkville"}
{"text":"I came to Benihana for a birthday dinner. We were seated quickly and a server came right away to take our drink order. I felt the pace of the service all night was okay, came by and served our soup and salad in a timely manner, filled up our water and gave us tea etc. I thought the food was good. It was entertaining. They cooked the steak very well. The fried rice for $6 is mediocre though, thought I was getting a bit more for $6 worth. The shrimp was good. I wish we got more zucchini instead of onions though. Other than that I wish the bill came a little faster at the end but I guess they weren't really rushing us out. Overall I would have given it a 3/5 if it was just based on food and standard service. But I gave it a 4/5 because the service was good and the chef was nice. Would I come back? Maybe not since I find the meals quite expensive but you do get quite a bit of food."}
{"text":"Went for an early bday dinner here Saturday night. We waited far too long for a table but they is give us a small completely app and apologized.   The experience was wonderful. The cook was very interactive and great at his job. All yhe waitresses and staff were so friendly and made sure we were doing ok, if we needed anything, clearing plates, etc.  The food was incredible! We had the summerlicious menu. The sashimi was so fresh, the steak was melt in your mouth (especially with the sauce they served it with!!), and the cheese cake was amazing!  Its pretty pricey even with the summerlicious price but definitely a great experience!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night expecting to be blown away. The service was great, the wait staff was very attentive and answered our questions well. The sushi though, we both felt like you can get the same quality at any AYCE if not better. The price we paid did not equal the quality of the food we received. It was good to check off our restaurant list, but wont be coming back.  We only had the ala carte though, did not try the Teppanyaki. Maybe it's better?"}
{"text":"See my list titled: \"My Japanese Steakhouse resume. :)\" to understand where I'm coming from.  I really like this Benihana. I have only been here on business trips and with colleagues. We have always had a great time and because it was a business trip nobody was looking at how much things cost, so keep that in mind.  100% typical Benihana experience that Rocky (Benihana founder) is hoping you always have at his restaurants but is sometimes not the case. No surprises but no disappointments either.  Really nice decor and ambiance. Fast, friendly, attentive service. Talented, personable chefs. The food is cooked perfectly. The drinks are always refilled and the waitstaff seems to know you are about to be in need of something because they are paying attention. Bar drinks are stout and beer is ice cold. This place operates like a well oiled machine.  I would not hesitate to return any time I am in Toronto, and on an expense report :) A great example of what Benihana should be, prices not withstanding."}
{"text":"I've been to other Benihanas before but this was the first time I went to the one in Toronto. Location was in the heart of the financial district which was convenient and there was valet parking which automatically put me in a good mood because I hate looking for parking in Toronto. I made a reservation for two the same day and the earliest I could get was 8pm so I guess reservations are recommended here.  Some of the things we ordered were:   Steak teriyaki was pretty good. I've been to several teppanyaki places and I would agree this is one of the better ones but not the best. The chef made a fun show but again, I've seen more elaborate teppanyaki shows at other places. The food was good though so no huge complaints.   We ordered oysters which were delicious and probably my favourite part of the meal.   We also ordered an assortment of sushi which was all fresh and well made. I was impressed with the quality of the sushi despite it not being a sushi restaurant.  For dessert, we had the mango mousse cake which was really good! It was light and you could tell they used fresh mangoes and I was fairly impressed.   Overall the food was pretty good and the ambience was laid back and fun. I would definitely come again but probably not for the teppanyaki - I thought their seafood was better than the actual grill. It's definitely a fun place for dinner if you haven't tried it before though."}
{"text":"It was a nice experience but i must say it wasnt that great. I have had better teppanyaki experience in other places. The restaurant was nice, i liked the deco & atmosphere. Due to the location the parking was a bit pricy. Im sure we could have found cheaper parking but we chose the vallet parking. Our server was very polite & attentive. There was a long wait for the chef to come to our table, i guess they were busy and only had a few chefs available. We were ok to wait, he was very polite and nice, explained everything as he was diung it. The food was average but good potions. The shrimp was really good & so was the onion soup. The chicken karaage was such a let down. We upgraded our rice to fried rice, it wasnt that great but was quite enjoyable. I loved the lychee ice cream (it had good amount if lychee pieces in them too) & the stawberry sherbet."}
{"text":"I went last night. This is a review for Winterlicious 2017. I was very skeptical about Benihana because it received some mixed reviews. Some said that the food was really good and some said that it wasnt worth the dollars. My review is that Benihana was just, \"A-OK\"(3/5). It was OKAY. Food was OKAY. Entertainment was ALRIGHT. I went to Iron Chef a long time ago in Mississauga and from my memory, from what I remember, they put on a more memorable performance. I got the steak from the winterlicious menu and my boyfriend got the chicken, which is served with grilled vegetables which overall, was ALRIGHT. Everything else like the appetizers were alright as well but the CHEESECAKE was so creamy and delicious. Anyways, if you thought about going here for WINTERLICIOUS, save your money to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because everything was tasty and perfect.  We had Toto as a chef and he made cooking fun and super interesting. Sushi is very good My favourite was the steak Chateaubriand and lobster tail, just amazing. It instantly became my favourite restaurant in toronto."}
