{"text":"Fantastic Italian food. We loved the pizza, knots, and wedding soup. I don't know how they make their dough, but it's very light. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The menu says-- NEW NEW Gluten Free Pasta...........................................$10.99, but if you order it, it is an additional $5.99 for gluten free pasta, making it almost $17.00.  Does this make sense?  I had an extensive conversation with the waiter and he talked to the owner and this is their policy.  I instead ordered the gluten free chicken parmesan from the gluten free menu --the salad came with croutons and the dinner came with regular pasta.  You guessed it, it would be an additional $5.99 for GF pasta, making it almost $19.00! I expect confusion from most places, but not someone who offers GF options on their menu!"}
{"text":"I have  ordered  from here several times . First  i tried the lasagna. It wa the  worst I have  ever had. The noodles  were over cooked and literally once slice of imagination  cheese in between. A little  of tomato sauce  on top. Decided to  give it another try the pizza was horrible.  I  ordered  several  toppings  and there wad barely any on the  pizza. I  will  never ho there  again."}
{"text":"Best pizza and italian food in Concord, NC.  If you want to have a family dinner; they have a nice dining section.  If you want to catch the game; they have a different section set aside as a cozy sports bar.  If you need something bigger?  Then the party room is just for you.  They honestly have it all and pretty good location as well. 

Give it a try!  I promise you won't be disappointed!!  Tell Pete \"BigDaddyNC\" sent me!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I have been eating here ever since I found this place before college. Every time I came home for weekends and breaks I was here multiple times.  Now after college it's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Love this place awesome food I go with my family at least once a week. Somtimes it can be slow but the food makes up for it. Great food at fair prices awesome garlic knots highly recommended this to my friends. Never had a problem here with the workers I don't know why other people had issues with them the owners are very nice"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices.  They do get a little funny with charges for extra sauces etc.  Great wings and pizza for gamedays."}
{"text":"If you are a Steelers fan and like Italian food. Then this is the place to go. .60 cent wings and $1 daft beer!"}
{"text":"I am very surprised at the one star reviews.  I have eaten here many times to the point that it is one of my favorite places to go in the area.  I have never had a bad dish.  My favorite is the Meatball Parmesan.  It is heaven in your mouth it is so good.  We also get pizza regularly and it is my favorite pie that delivers to my house, though getting it fresh out of the oven in the restaurant is absolutely the best!

We have always received great friendly service.  I can honestly say I have nothing negative to say and I have eaten there 20+ times over the past year."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing....

I'll start with the positives: the garlic knots are great. The food is also very affordable and you get plenty of food.

Besides that there is was nothing appitizing about the food. The service was terrible. The staff couldn't remember our order, and we had to tell the waitress what we had so that she could pick it up from the kitchen. Most of the entrees come with a salad, and the waitress brought the salad out with the rest of the meal. We asked for extra napkins and refills of our drink and never go it. 

There is nothing special about the food. The calzone has one layer of meat and then probably a pound of cheese. No flavor except greasy cheese. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The Chicken Parm sub was ok, nothing special. 

There are better places in Concord for Pizza or Italian food"}
{"text":"Don't understand the negative reviews on here. Went for a Steelers game and it was perfect. Atmosphere for the game was exactly what I was looking for but would come for the food alone any day. Got the garlic knots, fried ravioli and bruschetta pizza.  All three were perfectly cooked and served hot. Topped things off with zeppolis which were amazing. Will definitely visit again and strongly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife's favorite place for Italian food.  

We love to go a couple of times a month.  She loves the tortellini in their \"rosa\" sauce, and I have enjoyed their subs and pizza (both their style and flavor) !  Service has been good, even getting attention from the owners at our table."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews of this place.  The food is always excellent.  I usually get the meatball Parmesan with a side of fettuccine alfredo, both fresh and delicious. The pizza is above average, the wings are great, and the garlic knots are superb and filling.  They have zeppolis and canolis too! The menu is extensive with huge portion sizes, the price is very reasonable and the service is up to par.  The wine menu could be a little bigger and I wouldn't say the service is EXCELLENT**, but for a casual Italian meal in this area, it doesn't get better than Garfola's.

**We've had one bad experience in our 20+ visits to Garafola's in 3+ years.  The pizza took way too long and it was obviously the girl's first night on the floor (she forgot to enter the order).  We asked for a discount on the pizza because it took so long, and the manager was happy to do so.  That was three years ago and the girl doesn't work there anymore.  Don't let a couple negative reviews shy you away from this place, its excellent."}
{"text":"I was very impressed Buy my overall experience at this restaurant I ordered delivery and when I called the owner answered the phone and he was extremely pleasant. I could tell he had a passion for food and people, he not only took my order but he also made wonderful suggestions. The food was tasty!!! Someone has been doing this for a while!!! I will be frequenting this establishment!"}
{"text":"Delicious food in big portions and great service!"}
{"text":"Too high a price for low quality food. You might as well go to dominos and save the money."}
{"text":"By far the best authentic Italian restaurant yet for me and my wife this afternoon in North or South Carolina a must-have are the stuffed peppers as an appetizer the Caprese salad with fresh mozzarella cheese and then any of his signature pasta dish is absolutely out of this world food ..Pete, we will be back to see you soon!!"}
{"text":"as a regular at this restaurant ,we have always been pleased, we went there yesterday a party of 4, the food was awful. 2 of us got sick by the time we got home, this place has gone down in quality by leaps and bounds over the last few months, it is dirty,"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was poor, food was nothing to get excited about, wasn't anywhere near what we were hoping for. 

The wait staff while not writing anything down came back twice on our order. 

The food lacks flavor, calzone was burnt stiff on the bottom, and the salads were very weak. I could have easily produced a better salad at home."}
{"text":"Why hasn't Yelp created a zero-star option for their rating system yet? We have had some bad restaurant experiences, but have never been physically accosted by the owner of the place when we sent the food back! Until we visited Garofola's!

Not only was the food utterly inedible (eggplant parmesan tasted literally like vomit... the fettucine alfredo tasted worse than high school cafeteria food -- most DEFINITELY powdered sauce, and the salads made with pre-packaged, stale croutons and bittericeberg lettuce that tastes like it has never been washed...), but when we sent the alfredo back due to the inedibility, the owner started screaming at our waiter in the kitchen! 

I went to the bathroom while my husband paid the check and as I was walking out the door, I pulled up Google Maps on my smart phone to get directions to drive back home. (We live 50 miles away and had been visiting Charlotte for the evening) As I was leaving the place with phone in hand, the owner of the place bolts out of the kitchen door and accosts me. He pulls me by the shoulder as I walk out the door and shines the light from his camera phone in my face. He starts screaming at me that he is video taping me since he knows I am gonna put some \"bullshit about my restaurant on the internet\" and he wants a record of who I am. 

I tell him he can do whatever the hell he wants with his camera, and that I wasn't afraid of his stupid threat. I also ask him if he thinks that harassing unsatisfied customers is the most effective way to fulfill on his commitment to excellence in the restaurant business. He cursed me out, over and over, telling me never to come back to his restaurant, and I told him he didn't have to worry about THAT ever happening again. 

I hadn't necessarily planned on posting a review about this horrid experience until this despicable man gave me the idea. And added insult to injury by his disgusting behavior. I only wish I had been carrying pepper spray so I could give this man the lesson he seems to begging for. I can only imagine how many other people he will be harassing every time they experience their terrible excuse for food. I also really wish I could report his behavior to Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible. I would love to see him get his ass chewed out by that guy!

As I got in my car and drove off, I rolled down the window and strongly suggested that this asshole find an AA meeting and a good therapist. He seems to really need it. It'd help him to hire a trained chef as well, but this guy clearly only knows how to screw up his life -- not how to do it right."}
{"text":"We've ordered Togo from here a few times and a handful of those times something was missing or something was wrong with our order. But every time we have dined in with them it has been great! We are not a fan of there salad dressing but I liked the fettuccine Alfredo and the pizza is good!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food around, don't think we have ever been disappointed in the quality!  Hubby always gets the Manicotti just because he knows he can count on it being delicious.  And adding the meat sauce really does make it perfect.

I decided to be different and try the new grilled salmon & veggies.  The fish was seasoned wonderfully, flakey & tender.   But for the price I was expecting a little bit bigger piece.   Think I will go back to getting the Antipasto salad, which is huge - full of fresh meats & cheeses, olives, and the house Italian dressing is perfect for it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on 4/2/2016.  This was a busy Saturday night and the place was packed.  Graham waited on the 2 of us and the service was prompt, he knew the menu well and the food came out without a long wait.  Garofola's is a casual, reasonably priced, family restaurant with selections of pizza and numerous Italian dishes.   The restaurant is clean and has many Steelers signs and posters on the walls.  I was wearing my Patriot's hat and was still very welcomed.  This the second time here and the pizza is one of the best in the area.  Real NY style, 18 inch round pie, large slices with great tasting cheese and slightly crispy crust with some raised bubbles.  Another dish we have enjoyed is the stuffed banana peppers.  They are listed as a stater but with the bread knots it is a meal itself.  The dish is loaded with melted cheese and a tomato sauce, that \"Mama\" makes, baked on top of the peppers that are stuffed with a spicy sausage.  The 5 cheese ravioli is also a home run.  Peter, the owner, stopped by both times we were there and asked how the food was which was nice to know that he is concerned enough to be on top of things.  We will  be back many times and bring our Steeler fan friends for Sunday football games.

{"text":"Yuck!.... 

If you're ever in Concord and in the mood for some decent Italian fare,do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. To be fair, their pizzas aren't half bad and it's what I'd advise sticking to. Their actual pasta dishes and subs are a whole other story. 
I've eaten here many times in hopes that they'll \"get it together \" but with dry over processed Italian Sausage and overcooked pasta, they've remained sub-par. 
My most recent meal was a dish of Fettuccine noodles in a garlic/olive oil sauce(can't handle Alfredo) with Italian Sausage. This is clearly a menu item but when I called in my order it took several minutes of explaining to the staff what I wanted. She kept telling me how she was going to have to adjust the charge for this \"special\" order until I finally pointed out that it in fact was listed on their menu. 
Now, to the actual meal, the noodles were drowning in Olive oil so badly that I actually had to strain it out of the plate. I'm not quite sure what they did to the sausage because it came sliced lengthwise and partially diced???? It was so dry and flavorless that I actually think they cooked it this way. 
This was my last attempt to eat their pasta dishes here. From now on I will only eat their pizzas (if Brooklyn's or Rosario's is closed) and go to Olive Garden for Pasta. Yes, I said Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Marinara tastes watered down and I honestly didn't know it was possible to mess up ziti. I actually regret not going to Olive Garden, which is something I never thought I would say. I guess it might taste okay if you have never had Italian food before. I barely find the need to use yelp, but this food was such garbage that I had to warn others"}
{"text":"This used to be the best Italian in Concord. Always fresh. Courteous staff. The whole nine yards. Now its worse than Olive Garden. A friend got a Stromboli and it was cold in the middle. She asked for it to be fixed. They put it back in the oven and it got really dry. The waitress said she would talk to the owner. Well nothing happened. So she asked to speak with him. The owner finally came out and was blaming her for not telling anyone. Um hello? Then he said there was too much cheese. He tried to say he would only take half off because she ate half of it. Finally he took it off of her bill. I refuse to return and encourage you not to go there."}
{"text":"Used to work here, thought I'd visit to see if it's changed any.. nope. They got my pizza wrong and put a tip on my bill..... I didn't add any tip. Same processed food. I never could memorize the menu because it was too big. When you go to a restaurant and see that.. do you really think they are back there making each dish by scratch? Lol no"}
{"text":"This place is great! Good atmosphere and great service. The wings are awesome....great hot sauce! I also tried the Stromboli which wasn't too bready like usual... It was perfect. Although they support the Pittsburgh Steelers (Bills fan here!) I would most definitely come here again. They are super friendly and well drinks are only $3.00!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings.  The sauce and cheese on the chicken parm were great.  But the chicken was overcooked and stringy.   The wings were fantastic.  The salad had a lot of stuff, olives, cukes, tomatoes, but wasn't ice cold and lacked presentation.  Service was great.  Like another reviewer mentioned, my angel hair had quite a bit of water in it.  My brother said the meatballs are awesome."}
{"text":"If you're a Pittsburgh fan, then this may be your place.

Been here a couple of time though normally after Church on Sunday. Out doing a little Christmas shopping today and picking up a couple of things for a new Grandson due NOW. Wish he would hurry.

In anycase, tried it for lunch today which is a Saturday. Almost deserted which I can not figure out because it is pretty good and is authenic Pgh. The owner is from just outside Latrobe/Greensburg which is definately suburban Pgh.

Decor as you can see is definately Steelers although they are now getting some competition from NASCAR (Kevin Harvick) and lately the University of Florida, Gainsville since his son is in attendance.

Walked in and since we were the only ones there, were seated immediatly. Looking over the menu, by wife order the Veal Parm Sub and later added a cup of Wedding Soup. I ordered the Hot Big Deigo Sub which is basically a three meat sub, served hot with Italian Dressing on the side. Both my wife and I enjoyed our subs but this is the first time I have seen Wedding soup without pasta , normally orzo, as part of it.

All in all, it was great for lunch and I'm not saying that for the Pittsburgh connection. My wife is from Pittsburgh but I pull for another team/"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and trying out different venues.  I order a 16: Pizza with all the fixin;s.   Changed out the olives and green peppers for pineapple and jalapeno's Wasn't told till billed that you could take items off the pizza but there is a charge per item to put others back.  Stupid.  The pizza was adequate but sparse considering the cost.  Not on my return list."}
{"text":"Went in to help them price out some shirts. The manager came out & literally YELLED at the waitress right in front of me for not finding out who I was & what company I was with. Made her get him again from the kitchen & then she proceeded to tell me that he made her tell me to get out of his restaurant.
My friends & I had just spent $100 total on our table that weekend before & I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to help them.
Not mad at all about not being able to help them, but we will NOT be back if that is how they treat their staff. We will also make sure people go to a different place. Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dining here for a couple of years. The food has always been excellent. We go at least once every two weeks. Whenever we have family gatherings, we head to Garofola's. Owner Pete is friendly, visits with us now and then. And the salads are the freshest anywhere."}
{"text":"Pete Garofola grew up in a small town next to the one I did in southwestern PA. His first job as a teenager was working in a second generation Italian restaurant in town that served authentic Italian recipes. 
When I found out from the owners of that restaurant that he had moved south and opened his own restaurant, using many of those same recipes, I was very excited. 
Although I live 40 miles away, this is our go-to place for special occasion family dinners as we have found no other place in Charlotte with true authentic Italian food. 
I was shocked to see a less than 5 star rating on Yelp, but given the lack of authentic ethnic food in the greater Charlotte area, I'm guessing most of the patrons don't know how real Italian recipes are supposed to taste if they were the least bit disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp, and I'm only making it because I was SO impressed. It was my first time in this place tonight and it seemed busy, but we were seated within minutes of entering and our waiter had our drinks out asap! Our waiter was a guy named Chris and he was awesome! He gave us plenty of info and recommendations on the menu. I had the banana pepper app and it was delicious, actually everything we got was delicious. It did take a minute for our food to come out, but as someone who works in the restaurant industry it was not a long wait for how busy it was. Only warning is the PORTIONS ARE HUUUGE! Come hungry and you will leave full. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've given this place far more business than it deserves. The food is mediocre on the best of nights. Pasta dishes are always served with the bowl half full of water, even after you ask for them to be drained well. And the service SUX! Waitresses constantly change, are unprofessional, and pay little attention to customers once the order has been taken. Food comes out at different intervals. Service is slow as well. I've visited for the last time."}
{"text":"I am delighted with the family owned service and homemade food at this restaurant I can't say enough about how welcoming they are also, we had the bread knots and banana pepper  stuffed sausage  covered in red sauce that was absolutely delicious topped with  provolone and mozzarella cheeses. ( sausage very spicy) lovely smothered in cheese.... mmmm.  they were both just superior in every way!!!!I would recommend this restaurant for any special occasion or after work wine down they have a really cute allegiance to the Pittsburgh Steelers which makes it feel homey as well"}
{"text":"YELP PLEASE WE NEED A NO STAR RATING



  I CAN ALWAYS TELL HOW GOOD THE FOOD IS GOING TO BE WHEN THE TABLES ARE STICKY  BARF...

                   Where do I start first you sit on lawn furniture then you wait and wait and wait for what nasty food sauce out of a jar Alfredo out of a packet . And you wait  2 hours NO thank you . The servers are so confused they do not have a clue who ordered what. And the Owner ( I assume) says I am not sure what happened ?
        I know what happened you should not have quit your job at Walmart and who ever told you you knew how to run a restaurant  was A) A Family Member looking for a job  or B) Drunk  c) A Drunk family Member looking for a job.
            Are you kidding me?Never saw a Sports bar next to a \"SO called Italian  Restaurant\" And you go in the sports bar side to walk in? I tried giving  the \"food\" that I did not eat( All of it) to my Dog he looked at it smelled it and walked over to a tree and raised his leg.Damm  THATS BAD"}
{"text":"We literally love this place! The asiago peppers and garlic knots are phenomenal! We always spend entirely too much money here because it is so good. 

I only wish they insisted on having a more gracious and hospitable staff. The owners are lovely, but from the hostesses to the servers....blah."}
{"text":"Great pizza and Italian dishes. A little on the pricey side if you are accustomed to paying Dominos prices but well worth it. Love the coupon included with the large pizzas."}
{"text":"This was my first time here I had been wanting to try it for a while but never actually went inside but today I did. The hostess seated me right away it wasn't very busy when I got there I intended on ordering lasagna but there was no meat in it, you can order it with meat sauce for a little extra. I decided to go with something else I ordered the Cajun chicken Alfredo. All of their pastas come with a salad and garlic knots which is nice because I was going to order that anyway. The Cajun pasta wasn't too spicy but had a little kick, they weren't stingy with the sauce nor overbearing. The food came out pretty quickly and it was pretty good my waitress was very nice and patient and quick when I needed her to be. She brought me a box to take my food home in because the portion size was pretty large. A crowd started to pile in towards the end of my meal so I'm assuming around 5-5:30 business picks up which makes sense. There are several TVs inside. The place is decorated with lots of steelers memorabilia just as an FYI. I'll definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"So I had ravioli with pink sauce - which is, as you may have guessed, red & white sauce mixed together. It costs more to get this sauce for some reason, seems odd since you aren't getting extra sauce but a mixture but whatever. My friend said I had to try it so I did. I thought it was tasty!  It was served with garlic knots that were pretty good. 

We had the fried zucchini as an appetizer. They were long thin strips of zucchini rather than thick pieces like I have had in the past but they were definitely good. 

My friend got a chicken salad and it was huge. Made me think of the Big Salad from Seinfeld! Her plate was completely covered and piled high. 

They seemed to be a bit short staffed, not overly slow but it just seemed like we didn't see our server much. It was a little odd that my friends salad was brought out with our appetizer when it was her meal. My meal wasn't brought out for about 10-15 minutes later. 

When I was almost done eating the server told me they also have a spinach ravioli which I for sure would have tried if I had known but the cheese ravioli I had was good."}
{"text":"Food is good but normally takes a while to come out. Servers are very nice but the manager has horrible customer service and was not friendly at all. Won't be going back. It's a shame because the food is good."}
{"text":"Best pizza and pasta in Harrisburg/ Concord!! 
Come here twice a month! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I agree with all the others about a zero star rating!

This place is bad! I've eaten here several times, and I've actually had a few bad experiences. I live 5 minutes down the street, and I could walk there if I really wanted to - which would be great because I don't have time to cook a lot. 

One time I placed a To-Go order on a week night, and they said it would take 20-25 minutes. 45 minutes later I call to see if everything is okay, and no one answers (which I thought was strange). I called again - no one answered the second time. Finally, I decided to try with another phone. Magically, someone answers the phone! I got really frustrated that they were screening my phone calls. The food finally showed up over an hour later.

Another time we decided to go with some friends and actually dine-in. This was during the daytime on a weekend. We walked in and waited for someone to seat us... After we were seated we waited 20 minutes for someone to take our drink order! After waiting and waiting we decided to leave. We were so upset with the service that we went somewhere else.

Do NOT go here. Terrible service & sub-par food. Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Ate here once and wasn't a big fan of the spaghetti or the meatballs.  However, I've also tried the pepperoni pizza and thought it was much better.  On Friday, January 1, 2016 at approximately 12:15 pm I decided to place a phone order for a pizza pick up.  The girl who was working the phone at the time is the real reason of my one (1) star rating. I could tell right away when she answered the phone that we were probably bothering her.  After I indicated I wanted to place a \"to go\" order we were immediately told to \"hold on\" .  After holding for a while (and not knowing why) she finally came back and said her computer was down. However, instead of offering to write our order down, or even giving us an option to mind holding longer while perhaps rebooting the system, she just told us to call back in 5 minutes and hung up. So with that being said, we didn't call back and took our business elsewhere where we received much better service."}
{"text":"This was by far our best dining experience in Charlotte/Concord. The food is piping hot, fresh and made with quality ingredients. The pizza, the primanti sandwich, the wedding soup, the calzone, the mushrooms, the cannoli everything we had was unbelievable. We were stuffed for two days. Best part is the owner is there watching everything. Great people, great food, great service!! Make this place a priority when you get to town."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the service and food is amazing. The fried ravioli is so savory and they have the best new York style pizza I've had in the charlotte area. Their pasta and seafood is flavorful and rich. The wait staff is friendly and your glass stays full. They always have great recommendations and treat you like old friends. I always leave happy!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but was cold.  Ordered a large pepperoni pizza for delivery and it took an hour to get delivered to us.  I called them an hour later to check on the pizza and the lady said that the delivery person left 45 minutes ago!  They need to increase the # of drivers so one person isn't delivering so many pizzas."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a chance, stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. Customer service was outstanding. They actually gave me my meal for free because they didn't accept my brand of CC and I had already ordered, they said it was no big deal. 

The first thing you should know is owners are from PA and are huge Steelers fans. There is literally Steelers decor hanging up all over the restaurant. 

The food was really good, I ordered the Gnocci with marinara sauce and garlic knots, it tasted old school Italian and was really authentic. The prices were very reasonable too.

The customer service was outstanding, I sat at the bar and ate lunch, they always have espn or some kind of game on. Owner and I chatted the entire time, they're pretty down to earth. 

If you want a quick bite to eat, check this place out. Their food tastes really good, I suggest the gnocchi."}
