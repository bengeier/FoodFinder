{"text":"I feel like with them not being established at this location long they have a good flow of customers.   Food:  The fish is good. The sides however are a little slack in flavor(mac n cheese especially). The tarter sauce is delicious. Check out their daily specials on the chalk board or miss out on a great deal. Sanitation rating is letter A @ 90.5.  Appearance:  Great intentions, decent decor and fresh looking paint but can be a bit messy during busy times.  Tables are wiped hourly maybe. They have a juke box.   Staff: Very friendly and generous with the portions. Screws up orders at times.  Recommend to friends/fam? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time eating at this place . I got the flounder and shrimp combo with onion rings and fries . I will say you get a lot of food for just $10 ! The food came out very fresh . However, the flounder tasted very bland with no seasoning and neither did my fries . The shrimp and onion rings were pretty good though . Please make sure you ask for seasoning !!   After a few hours I felt sick and stomach was hurting so did me and my boyfriend . I'm pretty sure it was the food so I'm unsure about that . Kindof scared to go back for that reason ."}
{"text":"My friends and I were on I-85 North and we went to stop for some seafood and saw that this place was new and decided to try it out. I ordered the flounder and popcorn shrimp. The flounder was bland and slimey. The popcorn shrimp wasn't crispy at all and felt like it was sitting for awhile and not fresh at all. No amount of seasonings or sauce could save it. My friend got the catfish and he said it was grimey. My other friend ended up getting fried chicken and the chicken was also bland and ended up making him sick. Also, the men's restroom was disgusting inside that it made the toilet completely un-useable."}
{"text":"I am allergic to seafood but someone had me try this spot.  I got a salad and it was awesome. It had chicken, ham, Turkey, onion, cucumber, tomato, eggs,  and pickles. It was huge. I finished it in 2 days."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch budget friendly and big portions. Specials every day!"}
{"text":"Worse customer service i have had in a long time. It all depends on how that manager's day is going when they first opened they had a great menu you could make a good plate but every time i went back they changed the girls at the register try to help but like i said the manger gets a wild hair up you know where and changes how they sell form day to day the thing that made me right this and never want to spend another dime there is last week my girl and i walked to order there were to ladies in front that said he just turned the fryer back on and the food was hot and fresh but when we went to order he whispered something to the casher and see the said we are closed. That is cool we left and went to captain D which had great customer service and the food was hot and tasted better anyway when we drove back home we passed pear 16 on the way back home he was open and serving people i will never go there again besides that a the same dirty manger who operated mr. Cs and. We all no how nasty that place was."}
