{"text":"I got beer and fried pickles. The portion is really big with carrots and celery sticks the fried pickles come in. The workers are super friendly and very kind."}
{"text":"Very recently during my stay in Windsor for business I ate lunch here.  The waitress was polite and attentive. I was told I needed to try the chicken delight which I did. Now I can say I know what a chicken delight is.  The order cake with a side which I hit the cedar salad.  The only thing I disliked the chicken delight has way too much creamy sauce as well as the salad   The salad was soggy. I ended up picking up the chicken from the wrap.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Really busy when I was there for lunch."}
{"text":"I have never been more disgusted and insulted. I went with two other people, walked in and sat down at a table that had not been cleaned yet. We waited 10 minutes until we had to get someone to come serve us. We simply asked for the glasses and table to be cleaned off. Waitress #1 gave us a dirty look, cleared off the glasses and walked away. She didn't come back. We had to flag down a second waitress to help serve us, table was still dirty. She asked us what we wanted for drinks with no menu to choose from, so we asked for a menu and for our table to be cleaned (again). She gave me a dirty look, scoffed, and walked away.   A THIRD waitress came to clean the table and take our order (finally). She came to check on us once, and about an hour after we sat down we needed a refill with no waitress in sight. My boyfriend had to walk up to the bar to ask for a refill, and waitress #2, who was dressed as if she were in her pyjamas at home, didn't even acknowledge him. Eventually he ordered and sat back down. She placed our drinks at the other end of the bar. At this point, we were getting pissed off by the lack of respect and service here. He asked if she would bring it to the table and she said \"you ordered it at the bar, you can pick it up at the bar\". He said \"I'd like to have it brought to my table and pay there or I can leave.\" She replied \"walk out and I call the cops, you've been rude since you sat down.\"   Since we sat down, waitresses didn't give us even a glimpse of eye contact for 10 minutes and we had to go and ASK for service. Apparently that's being rude.   I have never had such shitty service ANYWHERE to this degree, to the point where my boyfriend and I were both angry to the point we were shaking. Do NOT go here unless you want to be treated like shit. The typical service you'd expect at a bar or restaurant was asked for here and wasn't given, and apparently by asking for service we were being \"rude\"."}
