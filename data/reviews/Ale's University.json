{"text":"It's awesome to have a true neighborhood place in the area with a great selection of local beers and an amazing selection of food. The patio with tvs makes this place unlike most places in the area. I will definitely be going back. I recommend the Angry as Hell Burger. Great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the food is better than typical bar food as I understand it's mostly made from scratch but after paying $6+ for a few mixed drinks then being charged $2.49 for a soda....Really guys ?"}
{"text":"So amazing!!! From the buffalo chicken dip to the Burgers, homemade fries and Delicious Mac and Cheese.. Our first time here, just passing through and was amazed how awesome the service, food and cleanliness of this establishment... Calls it self a sports bar but decor shouts great place for anyone from single bachelor to family with kids!!!!!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place has, at the time of this review, a 4+ star average Yelp rating is one of the biggest mysteries of the modern world. To say this place is garbage would be a gigantic slap in the face to the halfway decent garbage that fills our streets.  It has been over two hours since ordering entrees with a total of 13 people in the place and still nothing. I would honestly pay someone not to go here to save them from this torturous experience.  Go to Cookout down the street, go to Lotus Buffet next door, hell go ANYWHERE but here and you will be ever thankful.   So service is a solid zero star. Can't even comment on the food since it hasn't come out. Avoid avoid avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the university area! The Mac and cheese plates so SOOOO good and large enough I always have left overs! The amount of TVs and quality is superb! definitely my go to place"}
{"text":"For the amount of service students give them, they have little respect. Come here on a college night and the bouncers are rude and have a false sense of entitlement. They'll keep a line outside even if it's dead as a way to still look relevant. Unless they get better drink specials, everyone will stop coming once the light rail opens. One star for somewhat nice bartenders though"}
{"text":"Avoid. I had a lot of hope for a fun college sports bar in the university area and once again, I'm disappointed. I won't even comment on the food, that's a whole other issue. I went to the abysmal 'college night,' or what they call a 'college night'; even though they claim its only 21 and up, that's definitely not the case. With that being said I had it brought to my attention that after that awful college night, my card was overcharged. Whatever sketchy stuff they do is none of my concern, considering I'm never going back. I asked for a refund and they agreed but I never saw the money returned. Whatever you do, avoid this place but if you have to pay with cash!!"}
{"text":"Plenty of tv's.....Nice variety on the menu of bar food....not spectacular but ok....service was good....parking  was a issue......fun watching them crowd the over 40's"}
{"text":"So my first experience here wasn't great, but it's been a whole year since that day, so I figured it's time to update!  The buffalo chicken dip is something I order every single time I go in or even when I order from postmates...it. is. amazing. Pro tip: ask for less blue cheese if you're sensitive to really salty bites!  My brother cleaned his plate (cajun chicken pasta) in under 10 minutes one day, so I would say that is a recommended item, too, along with the PCP burger, teriyaki chicken wrap, turkey BLT wrap(served cold),  I had an experience with the wrong order being given to my postmates driver one time, I called, vocally upset, and the manager told me to come back later for my free, corrected meal. They do a good job making their customers happy, you just have to ask and not keep it to yourself otherwise they won't know you're not 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Good service, lots of TV's, decent chicken tenders, OK wings, and nothing special drink specials.  And I have no clue what they're thinking on the music.  I think its kind of a weird place to put a bar.  Right next to the longest established bar in the area and right across from a place that's had all kinds of issues housing a sportbar for the long term.  So be it, there are more students at UNCC then when I went there, but just seems like too much for one tiny little shopping center.  My server was nice, and pretty cute, lol.  She did her best.  We ordered some wings and should have said extra crispy.  They were oversauced and doughy on the outside.  I don't think they were sitting in the sauce long as they were super hot(temp).  Edible, but nothing special.  The batter for the chicken tenders was awesome although the texture of the chicken wasn't all that.  A $2.50 Coors lite special wouldn't be something I'd go out of my way for.  The music, lol.  There were some great ones, but then it got weird.  We went from old school hip-hop into some Cypress hill, then Come on Eileen?  Then you played closing time at like 9:15 when were all watching football?  It was honestly kind of weird.  Not trying to be a hater, wish them the best of luck in this endeavor.  Although pleasant, the muscle bound door guys don't really seem necessary to me.  Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Small but cozy bar with welcoming staff. Good placement of TVs to watch sports. Had the Cajun pasta which was decent. A little to much Cajun seasoning on the chicken but the overall dish was well cooked. My son had the ribs which he seemed to enjoy, my fianc√© had the salmon which he said was ok. Overall I would return to watch a game, but I would skip the entrees and maybe just order a drink and an appetizer."}
{"text":"I had the kabobs with macaroni and cheese. The macaroni was really good...if only it could've been hotter? The kabobs were charred and flavorless. I received 3 of them and I didn't finish one. The salad was just ok. The sweet tea was warm. The ice had melted. I know you're thinking... Why didn't I simply ask for more ice?  By time the waitress came to our table my husband was asking for the check. Poor service. The place was not busy during our visit. Four tables were occupied with about 12 patrons."}
{"text":"I came because The Flying Saucer across the street was closed and the waitress recommended I try here. The service was average and the food was equally so. The appetizer I tried was the tot-chos and they were unimpressive in presentation and flavor and seemed to be lacking something aside from the fact that I choose spicy sausage but got beef instead. I decided to go with the Ale Burger (i believe) w/ the fried egg, I added bacon to it and let's just say it didn't help elevate the burger. It lacked seasoning and very average. I probably won't come back unless it's the last resort."}
{"text":"Walked in this Saturday afternoon (was empty as usual) and the bartender didn't even say a word to us. We sat ourselves and made eye contact with bartender and she never came over or even gave us a \"someone will be with you soon.\" We took our business to the Saucer across the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Walked over for some food last Thursday. It wasn't busy at all which was a little worry some, lots of staff just standing around which was a little uncomfortable but we sat at the bar and ordered food anyways.   It was delicious and the bartender was super friendly and helpful. I for the chicken fingers and a salad and my boyfriend got a burger and some wings. The food was really good. The salads was huge and so good. The wings were almost fall of the bone and we took the bartenders recommendation in the angry sauce which was a win! Decor let try that if you go!   The spot is small but will probably feel bigger after the patio is open. Over all pretty good id definitely go back."}
{"text":"Took the love of my life and our most prized possession to what we thought would be a tasteful adventure of trying something new. To be honest, one of the only reasons we went was for the half priced wine. Although it's half price, they failed to mention you only get Half of a glass  we order some Kind of eggroll to start us off. It lacked flavor and was a disappointment. Oh, let me mention that our entrees took 30 min to come out. We ordered the garlic fries aka season fries, our son got chicken wings and they gave him no dipping sauce, well only because we had to ask the waiter twice for some ranch as she was obviously too busy with the only two tables she had in her section(including us) My girl ordered the flavorless Mac n cheese and the kabobs that only had two small pieces of meat and some big ass onions. Oh and if you like a bowl of onions and bell peppers drenched in oil, then the mixed vegetables is the side you need! Please do not go here to eat. On top of the terrible service the cook SUCKS BIG MONKEY BALLS   P.S (she charged me .50 for an \"extra\" ranch that she forgot SMFH"}
{"text":"I came into Ale's on a slow night and I have waited over an hour for food, slow service, & as an African American patron, guest said that we were making them uncomfortable simply by being here. Our money spends just like anyone else. Waitress seemed irritated whenever anything was asked. I also received lukewarm food and sat in a dirty restaurant where a bulldog ran loose with freedom and was highly disappointed. I wanted to like this place based off the amazing menu; however The service and timeliness was terrible"}
{"text":"Service was great, the staff was exceptional. The food is excellent and everything that the group of us ordered was worth getting again. The prices were very reasonable, especially for the portions that we received! The beer selection is good with great local choices in cans and on draft. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really love the grandma Minnie fried chicken salad. Also they literally might have the hottest staff in Charlotte. Great place to eat and overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because the reviews seemed awesome. I'm currently here and my appetizer took 40 mins to come out. I ordered it with my first bar drink. I am on my second. I had to ask the bouncer who was checking id's to go grab her so we could order. We ordered. The burgers are to be continued. The drinks from the bar were fine. This is my first time here. They are not super busy. The appetizer came out super hot. The egg rolls were good but not 40 mins good. The burgers came out and they were amazing. Everything was hot and fresh. We moved inside because of the rain and realized our server was the only one working tables tonight. I'm guessing the wait was the kitchen not her. 10$ off our bill for the wait."}
{"text":"This was the site of a Yelp Elite event called Toys for Tater Tots.  We ended up with a sampling of various food items including Tacos made with Tater Tots as a base, sliders, frosted pretzels etc. At the same time, we ended up ordering some items straight off the menu as well to round out the evening.  Everything that we had was excellent. Service is great and it'a high energy place with a lot of things going on.  Will definitely be back after the holidays and thing settle down to check out the menu further."}
{"text":"Food and drinks took forever. Tortilla chips undercooked as they were still soft.  Both our orders were processed wrong. Mainly due to unfocused and unconcerned staff. Even when we asked to speak to the manager he had no idea. My meal sat in slop. My partner's was just literally not what we asked for. I've never walked out without paying anywhere. This was a first. It was THAT bad. Weekday before 12pm. Too many OBVIOUS issues so early in the day. Be wary people ..."}
{"text":"This is the SECOND time I've come on a Monday for 1/2 price burgers. The first time (months ago) I got sick afterwards and thought it was just something with me personally. Well yesterday I spent the morning throwing up all of my dinner I ate the day before on Monday. My friend also happened to give a little bit of the burger meat to my dog. And guess who is also throwing up and additionally has some irritable bowels... my dog. the service was fine and that's strictly the only reason this review is getting more than the minimal 1 star. I will not be eating here ever again unless I want FOOD POISONING."}
{"text":"First order from Ale's University.  Order was placed via Postmates for delivery to my home. Food arrived fast and everything was prepared exactly how it was ordered.  Got 2 mushroom Swiss burgers.....yum.  Will order again and will also use Postmates again."}
{"text":"I love their food but every time we get food here they mess it up to some degree. I mean I know there are a bunch of college students that work here and that is fine but there has to be come kind of quality control. Also to top it all off the University location has the wrong phone number (listed on their website) which apparently will never change even though we've told them multiple times. Seems like a great way to run a restaurant, into the ground."}
{"text":"Awful, went there for my brothers birthday and waited 20 minutes and still didn't have a drink. Stood at the bar waiting to order a drink when the first bartender rudely said, someone is sitting there. I said we just want a drink. She walked away, another person came over asked what my brother wanted and walked away and never got it for him. Needless to say we left and walked across the lot to press box. Bes decision we made all night. They are nothing like the south park location."}
{"text":"We visited Ale's University last evening and we will definitely return and recommend to all of our family and friends.  The atmosphere is relaxing and the food exceptional. We ordered the steak mac n cheese.  Yummy and leftovers for today!  We also ordered the wild salmon with mashed potatoes.  Delicious.  We started with the most simple appetizer of sliced apples, chips, pretzel bites and yummy cheese dip.  So simple but a wonderful combination of flavors.   But what makes this place amazing is the staff.  From the moment we walked in the door to our time eating at the bar, everyone was so kind and welcoming.  When the orders took a little longer than the staff were happy with, they were so apologetic and eager to do anything to make our experience with them enjoyable.  We were just enjoying a date night with no time constraints but the staff were concerned about us having a nice time, which was so refreshing!  We especially enjoyed observing and interacting with Shelby and Kenan.  They were every where making sure all of the customers were being cared for in a timely manner while being kind and conversational with all of us.  There was a concert at the outdoor amphitheater nearby and the restaurant got very busy just prior to the show, but it was fun to watch the entire staff pull together to serve everyone and get them on the way to their show.  We will definitely be back.  Thanks again for making a long overdue date night so special and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Great to have a real neighborhood bar in the area- and it's from the guys that rum the always fun Angry Ales on Montford Drive. Same great food, and it looks like the patio will be open soon.  Good local beer selection, and craft cans are $5 Monday nights!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get drinks and food! Our servers name was Faith and we didn't have much faith in her at first...but she proved us wrong and gave us great service! :)"}
{"text":"We were in town for a concert and wanted to grab a bite beforehand. Most of the places near our hotel were packed, but we walked right into Ale's. We stood at the front, waiting for the hostess for quite a few minutes. Finally, the bartender told us we could sit wherever we wanted. We sat at a nearby booth and had to wait a few more minutes for our server to bring our menus. I was starting to think this might be why it's not busy.   Once our waitress came over, we had good service the rest of our visit. We just wanted to order some apps to snack on vs meals. We ordered the fried pickles, Firecracker shrimp and Uncle Chuck's Nachos with chicken.   Our food arrived quickly and was all very tasty. The nachos were huge and had the right mix of all the good stuff. The fried pickles were really good. The star for me was the Firecracker shrimp. Just the right amount of heat and they were cooked perfectly.   Despite a rocky start, I would definitely visit Ale's if in the area again. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Right across from the bar you go to in college is Ale's: the bar movie characters go to when they go home from college on winter break.  Foods decent, the staff is friendly, but it's derivative.  Good place to people watch."}
{"text":"I love it here at Ales. Definitely a regular bar for me to go to. Great location, great food, great drinks, and great service. Allie is an excellent bartender and is very knowledgeable and personable. You're missing out if you sleep on Ale's University. Come here any night of the week for a great time."}
{"text":"We tried Ales for the first time on a Saturday night. The bar was packed, other than that it was pretty dead. Regardless of that, we were there for almost two hours waiting on our food. My buffalo chicken wrap wasn't very good. The chicken was diced or something? Honestly, I just wasn't very impressed. Their pull seems to be college kids, which is fine, but the food seemed lacking."}
{"text":"Still love the food but the service tends to be way too slow on the front end. It took forever for someone to approach us & to come back after dropping off the menu. Food isn't slow to come out. Just don't get much attention from the servers. WAIT!!!!  And then came Luisa!  The most amazing bartender/waitress I've ever had. Attentive, thorough, fast!  Thank you Luisa for saving the day for Ale's it will remain on my frequent flyer list.  But it requires sitting at the bar and having Luisa available. (Stars changed from 3 to 4.) (Thu 8pm)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Got the eggrolls appetizer which had the most delicious dipping sauce. Cajun chicken pasta was really good and cheap for the amount of food you get.   The atmosphere was calm, relaxing, and it wasn't too crowded."}
{"text":"Great food good drinks friendly service definitely will be back again love the ambience try the wings delicious"}
{"text":"Decent little place. Beer selection was generic local craft beer for Charlotte...nothing special. I think 3 stars is fair given one entree was on point and the other left a bit to be desired and I ended up getting a Bud Light bc I wasnt loving the beer selection. I wasnt giving them $6+ for a beer I feel so, so about. They do call themselves Ale's, after all. No complaints of the service but they also werent busy. My fiance got the ribs, mac n cheese and tater tots (and he is a tot critic and said they were perfectly done). He was very happy with his meal. I got the protein plate which had great flavor overall but the steak was minimal and very fatty and the onions were inedible they were so strong (I love onions but I left a pile of them on my plate). Overall there was nothing exceptional about Ale's unless you love mac n cheese in which case this is the place you will find a giant, gluttonous pile of it thatll stop you up for days."}
{"text":"I am literally drooling over my food!!! Four of us from work ordered pick up service and all 4 of us are in love with this place! We got the cordon blue mac and cheese, steak and cheese mac and cheese, kabobs, and chicken wrap - all of us are loving our food. I'll be back with my family on Monday to try the burgers. Thanks for making our first experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Beer-5 Food-5 Service-4. What a great college town bar and grill. Got here at 6pm and not crowded. Great beer and cheerful service. Ordered the Montford Protein Plate which was 4 marinated chicken and steak skewers over a bed of saut√©ed spinach with saut√©ed zucchini and onions. Fantastic. I will return here if we are in town again!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a Wednesday afternoon around 5:30. Oh instant sidebar, be careful in the parking lot there are huge pot holes that could probably swallow a Prius whole. Back to the restaurant, when I walked in it was completely empty. There was a girl at the bar on her phone in PINK leggings that eventually looked up and saw me awkwardly standing at the front door. She tells me I can sit anywhere and I ask her if any of the tables have an outlet because my phone we about to die. She points out one behind where the hostess would stand and tells me I can sit at the table near there. Lucky for me, my charger cord is long and could reach. The decor here is mostly wood and they have 5 or 6 giant TVs that I'm sure are perfect for game viewing. The prices here are pretty affordable. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta based on how delicious it looked in a yelp review photo. The food came out quickly, could be because I was the only patron but hey? I'll give them credit. The pasta was delicious and a nice size. They weren't skimpy with the chicken and it wasn't overly spicy. I was excited to take some home for lunch the next day. I'm interested in seeing what this place is like with a crowd. Overall, good experience and I'll come back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Surprised at how dead this place was on a Thursday night...things have sure changed since I was at UNCC. If you're looking for a not so crowded spot and good beer specials, then Angry Ale's is a decent spot. Food and service wise there are definite better places in the area. Bathroom was pretty gross with spit hanging off of the handle...overall ok experience for guys night."}
{"text":"The wait was about 25 min but the Cajun Chicken pasta was great! The sweet potato fries were cold but they were good. It's mostly a hang out spot for college kids but it was fine. I will go back and try the not yet famous spring rolls."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar type restaurant in the University area. It is always clean and the beer selection is great. The atmosphere is what I would call \"hipster pub.\" I haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't like but I would definitely recommend the fiesta salad with the hot ranch!"}
{"text":"Food is alright. Nothing that I would return for. Service is good and drinks are delicious! It's super busy on thursdays for college night so definitely don't recommend coming here unless you want to run into a bunch of drunk kids. Good location, patio is nice!"}
{"text":"My friends and I attended this establishment one night for a college party. It was free to enter. So we get to the bouncer in line and he said student IDs. We had our IDs but our friend did not. During previous visits we were never asked for student IDs. So the guy at the door asked for $25 to enter and that cost is ridiculous for that establishment and that party, so we leave. A few weeks go by and another one of my friends decides to go during the day for food and talks to one of the bartender's and tells them about situation and he was alerted that the guy who was outside was part owner who goes out there on random days and decides to charge black males and excessive amount to enter without student ID. And yes, we are black males. I am writing this to alert people of the discriminatory actions that are carried on at this establishment and that me and my friends who are black and some that are white will not be supporting this establishment anymore."}
{"text":"At first I thought they were crazy for opening up across the way from the saucer, but at the same time I applaud them. They have great drink specials, and a good food selection. Everything on their menu is fairly priced, and there's something for everyone's taste buds. I enjoyed their wings, and thought that their burgers was pretty good as well (I had a burger with an egg and avocado on it, can't remember the exact name on the menu). The overall appearance of the place was nice and clean, but I did think it was a rather small space all things considered. Overall, it's a good hang out spot, and a great place to grab a few brews and something to eat. Fantastic for the UNCC community!"}
{"text":"I order the chicken parm sliders for delivery. They don't look like much but they were pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"I got the mac and cheese and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious and could not be eaten in one sitting."}
{"text":"This place is definitely solid. We went while it was a little slow and we had a coupon. The server was a nice young lady who seemed new (oddly, she felt it necessary to tell us that she had to have the manager handle the coupon on the computer. Info I don't now that i needed but also no harm). We ordered the wings to start and our entree's. The wings were, across the board, the favorite of the table. They infuse the buffalo sauce with herbs that really make it stand out. We also go one burger (good), a 3 little piggy (pulled pork, bacon and another pork product) which I enjoyed a club sandwich (which was supposed to be on Texas Toast which we thought would be thickly sliced loaf bread, slathered in butter & garlic and toasted on the flat top grill. Unfortunately what she got was thickly cut white bread. Not toasted, or buttered or any of the wonderful things you would associate with Texas Toast.) Finally, my son got the steak which he enjoyed immensely with a huge portion of tots (they have TOTS!!).  So overall a pretty darned good experience. Willing, for sure to go back and see what other goodies they offer."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times this week for lunch.  The food is very good.  So far I have had the cheese steak, the cajun chicken pasta, and the chicken parm sliders.  So far, I have enjoyed every meal.  The fries are GREAT!  The restaurant may be new, but the staff has been very friendly, the meals have been great, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lots of tvs, decent beer specials, and food is good! So far I've tried the amazing Mac & cheese and quesadillas - both were awesome!"}
{"text":"So we've ordered takeout food from here twice. The first time, we just ordered the infamous Cajun Chicken Pasta. My bf barely shared with me.. it was that good. (5 stars)   The second time we ordered the cajun rolls and customizable mac and cheese. We were not impressed when we got home. The rolls had some weird greasy filament covering it.. was not a pleasant texture. The mac and cheese was severely lacking in sauce... it just seemed like dry noodles, chicken, and jalape√±os.  We will order from here again but, I will voice exactly how I want my food to come out. It looks like the dine in experience is much better, will try that next."}
{"text":"The service sucks. Wine is half filled. The food has no flavor. Got wings with no ranch and they tried to charge me .50 for it. Ohhh and she had forgot. So took her like 10 mins to bring it.   A bunch of young workers. So they aren't doing great services. Got the kabobs and each stick had two small piece of meat. SMFH. and the mixed veggies were onions. Green bell and zucchini in a bunch of oil.   The Phillip steak was a bit better. Still the cheese made the bread soggy which made it fall apart and nastyy.   I shoulda just went to the Chinese buffet next to me.   The food took 30 mins to come out.  I wouldn't of been mad if it was worth it. But the food didn't make up for it.   Try again."}
