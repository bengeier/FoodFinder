{"text":"Our party of four came here on a freezing cold evening before a Roughnecks game.  We made reservations for an early dinner time and am glad we did as the place filled up quickly.  The atmosphere is very nice and the service was wonderful.  We started with some soup and salads, all had a different pasta for dinner and ordered a couple of desserts.  The minestrone was thick and flavourful, the fresh made pasta was great, the sauces tasty and the desserts were a great finisher.  We wouldn't hesitate to come here again, maybe on a warm summer evening when we can enjoy the patio.  Oh, and no sports playing on tv's all over the place which means you actually talk to your companions!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been there for quite a while.  This place has really upped its game; good staff, attentive and welcoming atmosphere and definitely THE best risotto ever!  We'll done people!  This will be our go-to restaurant in YYC for a casual night out."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars. A small, classy restaurant with a menu serving classic Italian fare and a few local twists like bison short rib.  Before the meal, focaccia was brought out. It was baked crispy, and served with oil & vinegar, but no salt & pepper but you can ask for it. We were pretty hungry, so we ordered one pasta as an appetizer, then a pasta and risotto for the mains. Being in a creamy warm comfort food mood, we heeded the gnocchi warning from Janna's review, opting instead for a creamy chicken/pancetta pasta, the creamy lobster pasta, and the shrimp risotto. The chicken was very tasty, with a strong flavour of fresh basil and no shyness on the pork front. The lobster pasta was also good, but how can you go wrong with lobster and cream really? Although, if you're looking for chunks of lobster you'll be disappointed... it seems that they used physically imperceptible shredded lobster meat to give it the flavour. 

We had an incident with the risotto, and after follow-up with the management they comped it. On a second time around everything was tasty again, including the short ribs which had a distinctly non-beef flavour (too often bison just tastes like beef when cooked). We also sampled from their cocktail menu, which had several interesting choices that included housemade syrups and the like. While the front room of the restaurant is small, a passage way continues to two larger rooms in the back that I noticed were being used by groups.  With the attentive management, neat drinks, and good food, this would be a nice spot to have a company function for up to 80 people I'd say."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the bison lasagna here. It was a different spin on a classic, and it's hard to go wrong. 

The risotto here is also unreal. 

My only regret is I couldn't eat more in one sitting!"}
{"text":"This little gem was short walk from out hotel. We had a dinner on their outdoor deck which was very picturesque. I had the linguini with veal meat balls which I thought was one of the best pastas I have ever had. My wife had the lasagne which she said was delicious. Both meals were served with focaccia which was excellent. At the end of the meal we chatted with the waiter who was very friendly and gave us a lot of info about the Stampede which was scheduled to start the next day."}
{"text":"This place has top-notch service! I was here for a friend's birthday at the beginning of the month. There were seven of us, and our server was able to take all of our orders without a problem. She was very attentive and made our evening as comfortable and welcoming as it could get.

I ended up ordering the polpettino (meatballs) for an appetizer. These were fabulous! They used lean ground beef, stuffed it with bocconcini and topped with ricotta cheese, tomato sauce and basil. Please share these with someone because it is very filling for one. I also tried the bruschetta which was good, but nothing to write home about.

For dinner, I ordered the aragosta (lobster). It was a campanelle pasta dish with cream, telaggio cheese, panko crumbs, topped with a whole roasted lobster tail. It tasted like lobster mac and cheese. I found too rich for me, especially because I just stuffed my face with two LARGE meatballs and a glass of wine, but it would happily satisfy a mac n' cheese craving if I had one. Also, the lobster tail was a tab overcooked on one end.

Overall, this place is a little oasis just off the rowdy Stampede grounds. The small space, exposed brick walls and large windows add to the charm. I imagine that this would make a great corporate Christmas party venue. I'm definitely coming back when I get a chance.

The only thing I need to ask is, where do we park!? We parked in the Stampede Casino parking and paid $13 because we couldn't find a spot!!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner, mainly because it was handy to a performance at the Saddledome, and the reviews were good. Quite disappointed. It was so noisy we had to shout at eachother and had trouble hearing the server. One friend ordered the special, a salmon pasta, and said it was really good. Another had the beef shortrib. We've never seen a smaller piece of meat as a main. And we're not big eaters. It was a big pile of potatoes with a tiny little garnish of meat, but a large pricetag. I had the veal chop, which was good but a little bland, and very short on vegetables. However my only real complaint with my entree is that I've had better elsewhere for less $. Actually the best part of the meal was the bread brought prior to the meal, although they stick a stupid 1$ per person charge on your bill for \"bread and filtered water\", which they bring without asking. 
The wine list is extensive except for wine by the glass. If you're a rum drinker, just forget it. Nothing here my friend would have on a bet.
The topper was how incredibly long it took to get anything: orders, food, the bill. We figured they were drawing it out so we'd have to order more drinks. It took over a hour to get our food. We were pressed for time to make the event, and we'd allowed 2 hours for dinner.
Not going back. There are lots of better, quieter restaurants."}
{"text":"Who would have thought there was a top notch Italian place just steps away from the 'Dome? Honestly, I didn't know this place existed as the area is inundated with bars and burger joints.

I'm so glad a friend suggested this place before we went to an event nearby!

I guess other people going to the same event also had the same idea because this place was PACKED. I took this as a sign this place has to be good.

Browsing the menu, I was torn between a few dishes because I liked certain parts of each dish but not the whole thing. Well, our lovely server solved my problem! \"You can design your own if you'd like?\" Uhhhh, yes please!

Their fresh pasta on hand that day was squid ink spaghetti, so I added seafood pesto to that.

Noting before that it was busy, it took a while for our food to come out. But our server made sure our glasses and bread bowl stayed full.

When our food *finally* came (I skipped the bread, I didn't wanna fill up) I was really surprised at the selection of seafood for my pasta. HUGE shrimps (should we call them prawns at this point?!), mussels and clams adorned my plate.

I'm pretty sure no words were spoken while we ate because my mouth was so enamored with my food. 

Sadly, we had to leave as our event was starting so I didn't get a chance to have dessert. I'm hoping I can use that as an excuse to go back sometime soon!

Ti Amo, La Vita E Bella!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on La Vita, my boyfriend took me there on Tuesday. There was a flames game that night so when we got there, it was pretty full - of people wearing flames jersey's of course! 
Our server was really great. We weren't sure which red wine to choose and I'll admit that I judged her on her age and figured she wouldn't be able to help us make a decision. I was wrong. Very knowledgeable and very helpful! Had the bruschetta and calamari to start - you need to try these! For the main, he had the gnocchi and I had the mac and cheese. OMG the mac and cheese was amazing! I was full to bursting but still had to pile a few more fork fulls of the mac and cheese in before finally being done! I dream about it! 

I would recommend making time to go to La Vita!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a wedding rehearsal dinner. All guests came from around the world for this wedding. The wine was the only good thing 
In this small restaurant. Bread and salad too much salty and food with no salt and flavor and I hated the nasty tiramisu and when one of the guests complain about the dessert they didn't like it. Service was Zero star.
The cold coffee they put in front of us with nothing under it and no spoon and different size coffee cup. I think they give all the guests too much strong wine when they arrive that they don't recognize what they are eating and how they services are. Our rude waiters needed some training how to serve and attend customer. You can get better service in Macdonald and the employee even thank you. That restaurant needs complete change of chef and management attitudes.
That's all I have to say. Bond appetites"}
{"text":"Clearly disappointed and we had had such high hopes!
It was a Friday night, after the dinner crowd and we called ahead for a table for 2 for 9pm. No probs there, they did not even ask our names for the reso? Arrived and there were only 2 other tables occupied and then a few people out on the patio. The hostess was sweet and really, we had no problems with our server OR the atmosphere. The place is cozy, not too many tables and we liked the decor.
The problems lied with the food. Seriously, a waste of calories. :(
Started with the caesar salads which were passable. Needed some lemon and pepper to cut the too-creamy dressing - fortunately, the salad was not overdressed. Upon a referral from our waiter we took him up on his fave appetizer, the meatballs. These come out, 2 to a serving, quite large and stuffed with mozzarella! These were cooked through perfectly and were the best things we ate all night.
Dinners ordered, the pasta with seafood and the gnocchi. Would never recommend either of these dishes. The sauce was just the wrong pairing with the pasta. Pasta is supposed to drink up the sauce and the 2 components are supposed to marry. Did not happen here. M described his sauce as \"watery\", very tomatoey and in all fairness, perhaps ok on its own with a nice piece of toast but not with the pasta. M's gnocchi was stark white, naked on the plate with no lovin'. My seafood dish was a flop - the seafood portion was small and the pasta underwhelming, slid right away from the sauce. My dish needed a creamier base, maybe a rose or garlic cream sauce. We ate our dishes as we were very, very hungry but would not partake in any wine, dessert or coffee as we just wanted to cut our losses and head to Timmy's."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service very close to the saddledome. We went for supper before a concert and were very happy with everything.  If I had to offer a criticism It is a little squishy and noisy"}
{"text":"I will definitely come back! My husband and I were visiting Calgary for our first time and decided to stop in here for an early dinner/very late lunch. We stopped in around 4:15p but the kitchen wasn't open until 5pm. The host (Juanita) offered to let us stay and get some drinks until then. We opted to hit up the casino next door for a bit and decided to return closer to 5pm. I'm SO glad we did! We tried the prawns (huge!) and caprese salad (yum!). We had some of Juanita's recommendations for dinner and was not disappointed! And to top off the delightful dinner, several staff suggested some GREAT things for us to see and do in our last 24 hours in Calagary. I look forward to returning here when I come back!!"}
{"text":"While in town for the marathon we were looking for a place to  load up on carbs. We came across La vita è Bella and we decided to give it a try. The restaurant location is not very inviting, but the restaurant decor is very nice. We were impressed with their fare. Homemade pasta and risotto. We tried arancini (if you like Italian style ask for no sauce), millerighe and lasagna. 
Particular mention goes to lasagna! Homemade fresh ricotta, pasta and tomato sauce. Authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I are visiting from Los Angeles and first came to this restaurant last week ~8:15pm.  Our dinner was delicious and the service was great.  The restaurant is also very cute with a great feel.  We were in love and couldn't wait to come back with more people, which we did two days later.  But, the times on their website and google are incorrect and they turned us away at 2:10 saying the kitchen closed at 2pm.  We tried AGAIN that evening to return after an event we had attended, arriving at 9:24pm and were turned away AGAIN, very rudely.  They said that even though their hours say they close at 10pm, they sometimes close early on hockey game nights.  I guess LA has spoiled me by having restaurants open when they say they are and wait/management staff that is actually nicer!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to La Vita e Bella and I'm pleased to say that the Polpette is as delicious as I remembered them, in fact this time around the house-made ricotta may have took it up a notch. The portion of this particular appetizer remain huge and instead of 2 huge meatballs they serve up 5 smaller ones but they could have been a small meal by themselves. The tomato sauce is fresh and tart with the house-made ricotta smoothing out the flavours. They've never had a big menu but I think this is a wise move that a lot of other restaurants should take note of, I hate it when the selection is so long that I can't make up my mind what to have. I tried the Turconi: brown butter poached lobster, mashed yukon gold potato, asiago pecorino, bacon fat breadcrumb, the one thing I am disappointed with in this dish is the amount of lobster. At $25 the lobster was barely discernible.The dish was rich from the butter, asiago and bacon fat breadcrumbs but definitely not enough lobster, not one of their best efforts. Service was excellent as usual, attentive but not invasive. Focaccia was good but the balsamic vinegar and olive oil at the table just average. I have to confess that I'd keep going back just for the meatballs cause I like them that much. My star rating has gone down from my last review but I have to say I've sat down and defined what the number of stars mean to me; 5-stars mean both food and service have to have that Wow factor. I saw a couple of the same dishes still there from the last time like the Nero Linguini: spot prawns, baby squid, clams, blue mussels, tomato sauce, squid ink noodles and judging from the polpette, I trust that they have maintained the quality of that dish and will go back to check and see. I was there prior to taking in a show at Theatre Calgary at Arts Commons, it's walking distance from there and a pleasant walk on a beautiful evening."}
{"text":"I highly recommend checking this place out. It's literally 4 minutes away from Stampede Park. Very pleasant atmosphere and you will be taken care of like you're family. We we're so underdressed (it says \"casual\" attire on Yelp, but I recommend business casual at the very least) but even then, we weren't turned away or sneered at like some other places would. 

I'd say make a reservation, cuz the place is quite packed at dinner time. We were seated at the bar, cuz of our drop in (no res), but it was fun! Seeing the bartender mix up drinks and every single wait staff was so polite and attentive that at least 5 of them asked how we were doing and if we needed anything while we wait for our meal. 

Our meal by the way, was out in a few minutes after we ordered. Also, notable to mention, when we came in the door the host and hostess asked if we were seeing the Cirque du Soliel show at Stampede Park, which meant they would speed device along so we wouldn't miss the show. We told them we didn't and still got awesome service! They have coat check as well. 

Didn't feel rushed, at the end of the meal, we were handed the dessert/after meal drinks menu, but the Torcini I had was so filling and delightful, I paired it with a glass of Pinot Grigio. Sadly had to skip the Tiramisu I was eyeing. I really enjoyed this visit. First time, but won't be the last!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here at a friend's favorite Italian restaurant.  I came with high expectations after reading the Yelp reviews.  The service is top notch (the servers were attentive without being intrusive), but somehow the kitchen was hit and miss that evening.

Focaccia with balsamic vinegar and olive oil: this tasted like what they would serve at Chianti's (not like the fragrant, artisan crusty-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside foccacia you would find in The Italian Supermarket or River Cafe).

Arancini: great combination of flavours with the prawn and risotto balls in a panko crust.  The roasted red pepper sauce gave it that extra zing.

Torta di grancho (Newfoundland crab cakes with sundried tomato and basil aioli): 
Newfoundland, you have a very tough act to follow (after I've tasted Maryland crab cakes).  Not enough crab (or crab flavour); too many fillers (bread crumbs, mayo-mustard).
 
Millerighe: pasta with an extremely flavourful sauce made with ground veal, prosciutto, tomato, soffrito, basil, and red wine.    

Lasagna alla Bolognese: this dish was extremely disappointing.  Someone at \"the pass\" really dropped the ball here.   Although it looked like a work of art , it must have been sitting for a long time in the warmer--it was crunchy (like baklava)!!   

Misto di pesce: the confit tomato sauce was delicious and garlic herb potatoes were roasted to perfection.   However, the halibut and the lobster were overcooked and there were only two prawns in my bowl.

The mistake on the crunchy, mille feuille-like lasagna wasn't corrected until most of us had nearly finished our mains.   We were waiting for more than several minutes (the restaurant was nearly empty) for the server to return after we informed her of the error.  We were then given the option to order another entree on the menu, but I think that the servers/front-of-house staff might have handled the situation more efficiently if the management had given them more power to do so.

Individual rating:  Service: 4 stars          Food/performance of kitchen: 2 stars
Average rating:  3 stars

You're only as good as your last dish.

{"text":"I've reviewed this restaurant before so I'm just going to update it to strongly recommend the linguine carbonara.  Incredible dish.  Great balance of tender linguine, applewood smoked bacon and a very light cream sauce."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Tried two pastas and the caprese salad. Pasta offerings were with duck and bacon. Both were al dente and well seasoned. Caprese salad was delicious with great mozzarella.  Service was great. Only nit pick is the oil bottle had a fruit fly on it. They need a better inspection before being put on the table."}
{"text":"You have to pay a lot for a small portion. Even for the water!! The quality was average. The place is dim. I did not receive good service.I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"great restaurant. great service. great food. Simple italian restaurant with great italian dishes that are some what expected and also a little unique. Lasagna looked really cool, i had the feature pasta and caprese salad was delish. Cheesecake was light and so flavourful. We went before a concert and did not feel rushed or cattled in. it is in a great location for easy walk to the 'dome."}
{"text":"The service and the wine were exceptional....the food was BAD! The crab cakes were so fishy/stinky we couldn't finish them. My spaghetti was hard and full of salt. Olives and capers and I felt ill after we left. I don't know that I'd go back."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fresh Italian with a modern twist. Best third wedding anniversary we could have asked for.
The bruschetta is just enough for two people and it's a delicious take on the traditional.  It's served with the bruschetta on the crostini, between the bread and the tomatoes is a delicious, silky ricotta layer and the whole thing is drizzled with a maple balsamic reduction!!! Amazing is not enough to describe this appetizer; it set the tone for the incredible pasta and desert to follow.  
We had gnocchi and puttanesca, they both were light and flavourful. This definitely isn't old school Italian but it isn't the crazy foodie Italian either which made us very happy. We weren't looking for a food adventure, we wanted very well prepared, flavourful food where we could concentrate on each other and our anniversary night. The pasta dishes again were just the perfect size, when I say perfect size that mean you can have appetizer, pasta and dessert and be perfectly full.
Our service was attentive but gave us space and was there if we needed him - perfect service is just that IMHO.  The manager was there to seat and check on guests and he was lovely too.  When he found out it was our anniversary he offered us a digestif on the house.
Amazing evening, in a beautiful intimate restaurant, fantastic food and wonderful wait staff, this will be our go to occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"It has been over a year since I've been there, but the experience was so wonderful, that cannot forget it. I've finally signed onto yelp and wanted to share my thoughts on the cozy Italian restaurant. The ambience was wonderful with the fireplace in the room. It sure set a nice romantic feel to a wonderful meal. Our server was polite and helpful with giving suggestions to us. 

Their buschetta was simple and delectable. I really enjoyed my seafood pasta and what better way to end a perfect meal than with a perfect dessert. The tiramisu was the best I could remember having. 

I would highly recommend this place for romantic dinners :)."}
{"text":"La Vita e Bella is a great little spot and they even have some private dining rooms. We had a business meeting in the side room by the bar last evening and everything was wonderful. Our group of 10 were all very impressed by all our appetizers and entrees. Service was amazing and thorough, without being too invasive. 
I'll definitely be back. 
The parking lot is kitty corner to the restaurant along 12th ave."}
{"text":"Came here for a private dinner. Great atmosphere and great service. Very accommodating. Had their soup and it was the best soup I'd ever had. Their pasta was very fresh!! I wanna go back. Prices were very reasonable!! Great for private parties for up to 20 ppl in their back room."}
{"text":"Was here right before a hockey game and it was ok. 
Had 2 apps and some wine.
The meatballs were ok.
The gnocchi was dense, not light and fluffy.

The place is renovated after the flood and super cool with the exposed brick on the inside. It is fairly small (think restaurant in a house environment) so be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited because I finally found a Italian restaurant near my house. I even had a gathering planned with a few girls at that restaurant(7 of us). I was extremely disappointed and felt so bad because i got all my friends to gather there to pay a premium price for bland food. The food was nothing special, i have had better pasta at boston pizza. We were also always out of water and our waitress hardly came to check up on us. She was also extremely rude, and is even lucky she got a tip(although she did not deserve it). Both I and my friends will never be back to this restaurant, and i will make sure to spread the word on how horrible this place is.  If it was my choice, i would give this place zero stars."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Stodgy risotto. Pleasant service. Menu looks attractive but is much the same old stuff with fancier descriptions. We eat out lots so we are used to menus being tarted up but there was more disparity on this than usual."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on the Saturday night after Valentine's day and of the Family Day long weekend.  I made a reservation online (which was very nice that they offered an online reservation service) ahead of time and we were seated right away.  The service was amazing!  All the servers and hostesses were very friendly and everyone wanted to make sure we were having a good time.  The food was also very very good!  My boyfriend ordered the steak and it was about 3 inches thick and perfectly cooked all the way through.  I had pasta which was homemade and to die for.  We had great conversations with the hostess and our server.  Overall it was an exceptional night!"}
{"text":"And they call it bellaaaaa notteeee (Lady and the Tramp anyone?) What a great little Italian place! The place is charming and the staff are very friendly. I won a Mothers Day contest and dinner was being held at La Vita e Bella. 

While I do like Italian food, I can sometimes get lost in the Italian words and it was great to have the staff help out with the menu to explain anything as well as give their recommendations. 

It first started with fresh focaccia bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. The bread was a little stiff, but good nonetheless. For appetizers, we went with the Petinni and carote salad as per staff recommendation. The petinni was seared scallops with pea risotto and this sweet marsala glaze and it was INCREDIBLE. If they had that as an entree, I probably would get that. The scallops were on the small side, but overall, it was the perfect introduction to this place. I had a couple of bites from my mom's carote salad which was good and I loved the fresh buffalo mozzarella. She said it had a bit of spice to it, but it wasn't overpowering. She did prefer my risotto to her salad though. 

For our mains, the gnocchi was recommended, which my mom decided to get and I got the Gigli, as per my deep love seafood. The gigli was essentially a lobster mac n cheese on steroids. It was creamy, buttery, full of flavour and they definitely didn't skimp out on the lobster. They had this amazing bacon fat breadcrumb topping which was PERFECT. Considering the richness of the dish, it was the perfect size I LOVED IT! I had a bit of my mom's gnocchi and it was also good! She described it as being pretty spicy the more you ate it. I'm not a huge gnocchi person and her dish did look look a little too oily, so I did prefer my dish over her's. 

For dessert, she got the affogato and I was craving something tart, so I got the cheesecake with sour cherries. She LOVED her affogato as it was on the lighter side and did come with a shot of espresso for her to pour over her ice cream, which she said was a good pick me up. I really liked my dessert and it more creamier then your average cheesecake. The cherries complemented it really well and it was the perfect way to finish everything off. 

Overall, I was very impressed with everything, considering pasta is usually not my first choice when it comes to dinner. While we didn't come at a busy time, it seems like everyone who came in had reservations as it's a pretty small place. I kind of skimmed over the prices and it seemed fairly reasonable for most of the dishes, so I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food we have enjoyed outside of Italy. We enjoyed the polpette over linguini and caprese salad. The craft cocktails were also phenomenal. Our server was excellent. I wish we had time to eat here more than once. Truly a memorable meal."}
{"text":"How is it I've never tried this restaurant before all this time!?!  Glad I tried it out with my family.  

Started with warm focaccia bread with extra virgin oilive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.

Ordered the following:
Gigli - brown butter poached lobster, mashed yukon gold potato, asiago pecorino, bacon fat breadcrumb - OMG!  Lobster gigli & cheese up 100 notches!!!  I love it!!  
Nero Linguini - spot prawns, baby squid, clams, blue mussels, tomato sauce, squid ink noodles - so much seafoody goodness, all in one plate!  Fresh and tender calamari, giant prawns, claims and mussels.  Black noodles - how cool is that!  
Spaghetti - veal meatballs, confit tomato pomodoro, basil - I was told it was very, very tasty!  

Wait service was excellent.

One little con - water costs $1 a person.  The water is called Q Water.  Not sure why it's so special.  But the food and service outweighs this one little con of water being charged."}
