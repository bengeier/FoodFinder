{"text":"Cacao 70 has something for everyone, from sweet treats to savoury dishes. There are dishes where you can grill your own marshmallows, dip fruits in amazing quality chocolate fondue, or try a bit of everything on a sharing platter... and there are great savory options as well for lunch or a light dinner. Their brunch is my personal favourite!!! Love the omlettes!"}
{"text":"I really want to give a better review because I initially thought this restaurant was great - seems to be family run, and really good food BUT:  This was my 3rd time to Cacao 70 in Calgary, Springborough location, and here are my issues:  1) Just outside the restaurant as I was about to open the door to walk in, there was a man a few paces behind me who did one of those really loud disgusting snorts where you can hear all the phlegm snorting up through their throats and then they spit it on the ground. It is the most disgusting thing!  So, I actually said to him that it was disgusting.  So the next thing I know, that same man walks into Cacao 70 - he is an employee, and he starts making drinks and stuff.   I would honestly fire this employee for doing that disgusting act, right outside my restaurant if I were the owner.  It made an absolutely terrible impression on me.  2) When we walked in the door, we were heading into the restaurant and the lady behind the counter looked up and gestured for us to sit right by the door.   It was a really freezing cold windy blustery day in February, and we did not really want to sit right beside the door, especially seeing that the restaurant was half empty and there were several empty tables further into the restaurant. We said, we'd like to take one of the other tables, gesturing to all the empty ones that were away from the door, but the lady said she wanted to keep those ones empty just in case a large group came in (since there were 3 tables together).   Unless there are reservations for a large group, those tables should go to the people who are actually there at the restaurant, not waiting for What-if customers. So yes, the warm tables sat empty the whole entire time we were there while we sat in the corner behind the windy door.  So, yes, they have a lot to figure out as far as customer service. Also our drinks didn't come until after the food.  That happened last time as well. I'm disappointed because I wanted it to be a great place to go - as I love chocolate, but the poor service is just too annoying. I can't take it."}
{"text":"Chocolate heaven is here!  Cacao 70 is in the East Beaver Creek plaza which is littered with tons of restaurants.  While there isn't any parking directly in front of the location, you can find parking behind and all around.    I love desserts.  What I love more are desserts that don't cost an arm and a leg, in a cozy little place with great decor.  I love the black/white hexagonal tiles and cafe set up and the smell is amazing!  Just brings a smile to your face when you walk in and it's overall a great date place.  Their menu is quite extensive, and I'm pleasantly surprised by their (cheap) fondue which is around $12 for a single serving, which I thought was plenty to share between two people.  Their bowls containing melted chocolate is quite deceiving as it's actually pretty shallow, but again, for that price, I feel it's a nice little plate to share."}
{"text":"So first off, I can't speak for all the food on the menu. But I've tried the cocoa and fruit crepe, black and white waffle, and the classic fondue and let me tell you that its DELICIOUS. I am a crepe-kind-of-gal so this went right up my alley. I came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and CAME BACK with my mom for mother's day. If you're the kind to like white chocolate, I think choosing white chocolate and strawberries with your crepe is a great combo.   This did not get the fifth star because I noticed the second time I came in that one staff was smoking outside while the other doodled at a table. When they saw me come in they patted each other to get into positions so to me that didn't seem all that professional. Maybe my expectations are a little too high but it just seemed kinda amateur looking for the setting around them. They did whip up a good crepe tho, so if i could rate them 4.5/5 i would."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood gem! Amazing chocolate dishes, but also lots of brunch options. Extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service here. It's a dessert place so people are expected to sit, chill and peacefully enjoy a cup of coffee and some dessert.  Like any others, we came after dinner and were served our drinks and food. We sat and chit chatted and an hour and a half just flew on by. We were given the bill even without asking for it. I thought it was because the server was done his shift but was later told that they're serving our table to someone else and we had 10 more mins.  They basically wanted to kick us out but it's not as if they came by to ask if we wanted anything else or if there was a maximum of 2 hrs seating. There were 3 other empty tables of two around us and no one other table was asked to leave but us.  Needless to say, this is the first and last time I'm coming here!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best dessert place I have been to!! My order was fast and home cooked, the presentation was nice but most of all it was SO DELICIOUS!!! I would 10/10 recommend this place"}
{"text":"If you like chocolate, come here, enjoy the chocolate delicacies and have a great time. The end.   Cacao is made for chocolate lovers. It caters to chocolate lovers that love chocolate in smaller doses and it caters to chocolate lovers that would prefer to have chocolate delivered to them in large vats. Either or, you decide. I decided I wanted to have my birthday celebration at Cacao this year with my family rather than going to dinner. WHAT AN EXCELLENT IDEA. *pats self on back*  We ordered a variety of dishes to share and everything was great, as expected.  - A milk chocolate milkshake - although it didn't have any frills, was delicious.. thick and creamy and had a very strong chocolate flavour without being overwhelming.  - Black and white fondue - came with fruit, waffle pieces and brownie chunks - Ice cream dish (my favourite) - included brownie chunks, coconut flakes, and strawberry sauce and it was amaaaaaazing.  - Waffle - included caramelized bananas and ice-cream   This location in particular had a great aesthetic and was super cute in terms of the interiors. If you're looking to take a great insta shot (either of the food or of yourself), I'd recommend this location."}
{"text":"This is located where Demetres used to be, so you will have to park on the side and walk around to it.  This was the first time I tried Cacao 70 and I went with a few friends and it was an enjoyable visit. To start,  I ordered the \"Outlaw Chicken Waffle\" and I was expecting it to be an open faced dish, however it came out as a sandwhich where the bread was the waffle. It got rather messy to eat, but it was not bad, it wasn't particular memorable.   On to the dessert, which was what I was most excited about. :) Our table ordered the double of the Earl Grey chocolate fondue set, and a single of the Classic dark chocolate fondue set. The dark chocolate was rich and smooth and it was our preference over the Earl Grey chocolate. Our table was disappointed over the Earl Grey chocolate because it was a white chocolate base which we did not know when we ordered it, we were expecting a milk or dark chocolate base. Perhaps they should of listed in their menu that it was made with white chocolate. The Earl Grey chocolate was insanely sweet where we had difficulty finishing as it  hurt your teeth after each bite.   Overall, it was still an enjoyable experience and atmosphere and I hope to try more of their desserts next time."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into Cacao 70, I was lured into a strong aroma of sweetness. A creamy, rich chocolate fragrance filled the entire restaurant. Staffs were scrambling to fulfill customers' orders while I I tried to compete for their attention for a table. I hadn't even look at their menu yet but was already distracted by their product display. From chocolate bars, to cocoa powder to fondue set, each packaging was tastefully designed and an art of its own (see what I did there?). Their interior design of this space was gorgeous. Semi-open concept kitchen with beautiful decor, eye-catching chevron chairs and stunning patterned floor tiles! I just couldn't stop taking pictures of this space!  Their menu included options for brunch, dinner and desserts with brunch menu starting from morning until 4 pm. Some of the brunch items included the good ol' classics such as croque-madame, omelettes, frittatas and savoury crepes. I ordered their savoury waffles that came with smoked ham, sunny side up eggs, roasted mushrooms, roasted red onions, green onions, white cheddar cheese drizzled with bechamel sauce and maple syrup. It was a perfect dish to start my day. My hubby ordered an American Frittata which came with bacon, smoked ham, roasted red onions, green onions and maple syrup. With his brunch item, it also came with bread, a fruit plate and a small chocolate fondue which really hit the spot!  For those of you who have a sweet tooth like myself, Cacao 70 also offered an extensive dessert menu. Beside chocolate fondue platters (starting at $11.95) that came with exciting flavours such as Earl Grey, Matcha, Coffee, and Peanut Butter, served with fresh fruit, brownie bites and waffle bites, they also had traditional indulgences such as milk shakes, cakes, waffles and crepes!  I couldn't wait to be back to try out their dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Great spot if you have a sweet tooth. The food has never tasted so fresh and flavourful! Super friendly staff. Even the owner gets to know his customers. 10/10 would go back."}
{"text":"There's a whole lot of hype for this place. I saw it all over Instagram and thought okay got to try out this place.  I got the white and Chocolate fondue with fruits, waffle and brownie, and two vegetarian dishes. Everything was really good.   The chocolate syrup was yummy and super sweet, but honestly not as unique as other fondue places I have tried. The fruits that came with it didn't taste too fresh.  The cheese and mushroom waffle I got was really good! It came with egg however which I thought was pretty random.  The vegetarian crepe was really good as well. It came with mixed vegetables and egg served on the side.   The biggest downfall is the price. Everything was really overpriced which I was surprised about."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Portions are ok but i feel the fondue portion could be a bit more.  Servers were ok but should try visiting not on a weekend"}
{"text":"Drove by the restaurant on my way to Tsuki Izakaya on York Boulevard for dinner with a friend on Canada Day and decided we'd pop in for dessert afterwards. This restaurant is located at the exact location where the Demetres used to be. There is a parking lot that is shared amongst all the other restaurants in the area, so you will need to walk a few steps before you reach the entrance of the restaurant. It is on the ground floor so is easily accessible. This restaurant not only serves dessert, but other drinks as well as hot foods and sandwiches.   If you like chocolate, you'll enjoy dining here. The name of the restaurant kind of gives it away in a sense. I'm not much of a chocolate person, so my choices were slightly limited in terms of what to order for dessert, although they were nice enough to make some small adjustments for me in my order. I had ordered the Raspberry Brownie Parfait but had substituted the raspberries with strawberries and requested for no melted chocolate, chocolate sauce, and homemade berry sauce (it still came with chocolate sauce, but not a huge deal). This parfait consisted of 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, raspberries/strawberries, chocolate brownie bites, whipped cream, melted chocolate, homemade berry sauce and chocolate sauce. The dessert, I'd say was how I'd expected it to taste, nothing extraordinary and maybe even a little on the pricier end for what I got. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated and very well lit with lots of natural lighting for nice photos to be taken.   A friend of mine had told me that their hot chocolate was delicious, however, it was too hot to drink hot chocolate, so I'll come back for that one, maybe in the winter or when it gets cooler.    It wouldn't be too fair for a non-chocolate lover to critique this restaurant, but I would consider my dining experience to be just average. In comparison to other dessert restaurants, this restaurant is trying to focus on too many menu items that consists of both hot foods and desserts which may take away from the focus of chocolate (their main selling point).   The next time I go back, I'll probably focus more on their drinks menu."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm not much of a dessert or waffle lover. So most of the stuff on the menu does little for me.  I ordered the tuna wrap which doesn't come with any sides.  It looked very bare on the plate (see photo).  Even worse was the fact that the wrap was soggy because there is too much mayo. Since wraps are meant to be eaten without utensils, it was a messy but tasty meal.  The decor was cute and casual.  The waffles and desserts looked attractive.  My companions' dishes are shown below.  I wondered about the name of this place.  Apparently, cacao is the French spelling of cocoa."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend, didn't see it at first glance but it's a small place with very cute decors. I had the ham and bacon crepe for dinner and we had the classic fondue, it was great! The girl who served us was very nice and she gives us suggestions. Will totally recommend this place and will come back for more fond"}
{"text":"loads of ham and sausage make the omelette tastes way too salty.  food is dished out with very good presentation but only with so-so quality, no comparison to those in downtown.  it's overpriced but a good place to go on weekend if you want to sit longer and chill with friends - quiet and no line up.  may come back to try its dessert but definitely not for brunch"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not a sweets person!   The earl grey chocolate was sweeter than the matcha - the matcha had a hint of bitterness that I didn't like as much. It came with four bowls of fruit - apples, pineapples, banana and strawberries. I really liked the waffle that came with! It was realllly soft. I'd consider getting the waffle options next time. I found the brownie really sweet - but still good as a bite.   The chocolate (dark, I think) that came with the marshmallow pizza was pretty standard tasting, but I think I liked it best out of all three chocolates.   The pizza came on a really soft pita, and was loaded with lots and lots of marshmallow. I had a bite and that was enough for me lol. This order also came with a bowl of strawberries and another bowl of bananas.   Come well before 10, because when a group came in at 9:40, they got rejected.   Overall, not bad, but not amazing for the price. I'd give it a 3.5/5.   Also, I wouldn't recommend getting any of the chocolates on the counter as I noticed that it was collecting dust..."}
{"text":"(Food:) The SMOKED HAM PANINI was amazing!  The bread was toasted perfectly and had a nice crunch to it.  The ham and mustard had a really good mix!  I definitely zoned out while eating this sandwich!  The ROASTED VEGETABLE WRAP was also quite nice, with the goat cheese and pesto sauce having a nice effect together.  A really good vegetarian option!  We also shared a CLASSIC FONDUE with MILK CHOCOLATE.  Oh my goodness this was heaven on the tastebuds!  It came with two sides of fruit, waffles and brownies.  All of which matched very well with the milk chocolate.  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, considering we are just dunking sugary things into chocolaty things.  The brownie, however, was probably the one that makes you feel like you are done with dessert though.  (Price:) SMOKED HAM PANINI: $9.75 ROASTED VEGETABLE WRAP: $9.75 CLASSIC FONDUE with MILK CHOCOLATE: $11.95  (So cheap!)  (Ambience:) Beautiful! So brightly lit and clean.  Has a really nice vibe to it!  Very chic!  (Service:) Great!  (Comparable:) A better version of Demetre's in my opinion!  (Overall:) Cheap place to eat!  Come with a sweet tooth and you will leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"The service was great! Our visit was on a Wednesday evening and it was on the quieter side.   The young lad who served was friendly, knowledgable and most importantly, personable. It made the experience much better.  I recall a very chic and bright space with tables layed out assymtricslly. No booths or couches, but a fast casual feel.  Here's why I give it a 3. The dessert is very simple. It's true to the sum of it's parts. It looked as it would taste. I was not blown away by the taste, contrast and flavors. Nor was I disappointed  This place is on the pricier side for dessert.   Overall, nice place away from a busy intersection. This place was good, but I want more creativity and complex flavors.  - Dave"}
{"text":"Ordered: - Illegal chocolate waffle - Bring it all on sharing plate for two or more  Let's get the bad out of the way. - Overpriced in my opinion.  - For a place that specializes in chocolate, the menu descriptions really does not do it justice. Once you're in the door and seated (you quickly forget what cocoa 70 chocolate is (if that brand of chocolate means anything to you) - \"Melted milk chocolate\" does not mean much. For all I know, it could be some plain ol chocolate that was used. At least lie to me about how fancy the chocolate you are melting is so that it aligns with the price being charged.  - Illegal chocolate waffle - Waffle was poorly done. It came out looking sad and tasted bland. It wasn't the slightest bit crispy - not even the edges where it's typically thin and easily overcooks. I tried a piece of the waffle off the sharing plate as a comparison and that wasn't any better. My Eggo waffles at home tastes better. Bananas accompanying the waffles was not good. Presentation of the waffle plate was not good. Overall, poor quality here.  - Sharing plate is just robbery!! Everything there is so ordinary. Nothing there stands out. Bad waffles, bit of fruits, graham crackers and wafers, pieces of brownies, marshmallows, vanilla ice cream, pita bread with chocolate drizzles, all for close to $40?!?!  - Too ordinary for a specialized dessert place. Desserts not impressive. Prices not justified. Any wow factor I had at the beginning vanished instantly.   Now onto the good. - The interior decoration is nice. - The vanilla ice cream was alright.. - From what we ordered, there were few components that was just ok.  - There's not a whole lot of good I can say about my experience here.   Cacao 70 is a Canadian company that is expanding its brand out from Montreal. The way this particular location executed, I quickly forgot I was having \"cacao 70\" chocolate. It might as well have been any run of the mill type. The value just wasn't there. I love to support a local/Canadian business, and I did that this time. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's such an aesthetic cafe with the most delicious desserts. I particularly like this place because they are very accommodating with my nut allergy unlike other dessert places. I normally order the black and white chocolate fondue which is phenomenal (even though it can be slightly heavy).  Prices are fair for what you get. Also, the place was very empty when I went so it was nice that it wasn't packed with people! So glad it opened in richmond hill! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was glad to hear Markham was getting another dessert place because I love my desserts, but I was not mind blown by Cacao 70. I went with a group of 5 and got the shareable platter for 2 or more people which came with a bit of everything from their menu. We got the matcha chocolate fondue and it came in a nice bowl that looked very deep but the bowl stopped a quarter way in and that's all the fondue we got. They should give more to accommodate all the fruits, waffles, marshmallow, and sweets we got, by the end we were savaging from what was left and we still had a lot of things to dip.   I don't think it's worth the price to do the fondue sets if you were to come to this place since I thought it was pretty basic and could do it at home, but I would come back to try their unique creations of waffles and shakes!"}
{"text":"After surveying all the dessert that my friends were having. I'm not that impressed with the quality of food they are serving. The prices are not justified for mostly chocolate base waffles or crepes.  So I opted for a basic hot chamomile and yet it doesn't come with a decent tea pot for refills. The milk jug that holds the hot water got cold faster than what's in the cup.  Good plating can't beat good food.-"}
{"text":"I was so excited that this place opened up in Calgary after having initially tried it in Ottawa! Finally got the chance to check it out yesterday evening.   It was not busy In the evening with lots of room for large groups as well. The menu was a bit different compared to the one in Ottawa so it took me a while to decide on what to order.  My friend and I ordered a shared plate (sa-weet sharing plate for two) which included a milk chocolate fondue with fruits for dipping, graham crackers and waffles, vanilla ice cream on the side with marshmallows for roasting over a small fire ($27). You can choose to get a dark chocolate fondue instead as well. I also tried the American hot chocolate which is their most popular chocolate drink according to the server ($5)   The chocolate fondue was an illusion in that it was brought out in a bowl but the bowl was rather shallow so we ended up ordering a second one for the two of us. This plus the hot chocolate drink was a lot of chocolate and I think that it was a bit much for me. Next time, I might not do the drink or just do fondue with fruits rather than all the waffles and crackers.   The drink was really yummy though - very chocolaty! There are some interesting fondue options such as matcha and earl grey fondue that I would love to try next time!"}
{"text":"We came here with a big group of friends to try out the new dessert place.  The interior looks very nice with great atmosphere.  We ordered strawberry crepes and the \"bring in all\" dessert which has a lot of items that can serve 2 people.  The crepes comes with dark chocolate dip.  I find it a bit dry only have strawberry inside the crepe and simply some chocolate dip on side.  Other place would have come with more fruit and other item like cream.  The bring in all dessert comes with cracker, chocolate dip, fruits, fried banana, hot chocolate, marshmallow and a little fire pit for you to roast the marshmallow.  Note that the price for the dessert is very very over priced compared to other shop.  I also feel I got rip off from the chocolate dip.  The restaurant famous for their chocolate but if you look at the picture attached, the container that store the chocolate dip is very shallow.  The bowl looks big but very shallow.  A way to fool the customers.  With their over priced dessert, I don't think I will come back again because I can eat similar dessert else where for a lot less."}
{"text":"I ate here with my parents and it's our first time in Calgary and first time here. Let me tell you, this place is so nice and the food is amazing!!!!!! We were served by Marwah who was super attentive and sweet to us. She was also really patient with us as it was our first time! I definitely recommend this place and hopefully you get served by Marwah as well as she made this experience here for me and my family very welcoming and delightful(:  i also recommend getting the crazy 70 s'mores shake soo yummy"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Cacao 70, service was wonderful and the waitress was very friendly - we got our savory dishes in a timely manner and were both warm! We had the lazy breakfast and the Spanish frittata which were both tasty. Coming back to try the fondue soon!"}
{"text":"Yes!! I've been waiting for Cacao 70 to reach Calgary for what seems like far too long!   The parking in the plaza is limited so I'd recommend parking in the larger lot behind the plaza.   Cacao 70's menu is large, so if you have a sweet tooth, they have something for you. The prices are also pretty reasonable.  if you don't like sweets (?!?!), they also have a savoury menu, but I can't speak to that because I only come here for CHOCOLATE.   I usually order the chocolate pizzas but this time, I went with a friend and we got the fondue and grill for two. It came with marshmallows, graham crackers, fruit, waffles, and of course chocolate fondue (you can choose between dark and milk chocolate). It was a fun experience because we got our own little fire to roast the marshmallows!   We also got americanos, but I'd probably skip the coffee next time or try one of their specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Busy store. Luckily a reservation was made - even on Friday 10pm there was a line up. When they are about to close they notified our group it was last call for any food orders - that was a nice gesture.  The service was relatively quick. Food tasted okay but, a bit underwhelming.  Ordered a Bring it All on a Sharing Plate for Two or More($37.95) and Illegal Chocolate Waffle ($15.25). Both dishes overpriced!   The sharing plate included chocolate pizza, waffle, a side of pineapple pieces, sliced strawberries and sliced bananas, mini brownie bites(super mini), a tiny wafer cookie(sad wafer cookie), caramelized banana, marshmallows, graham crackers, americocoa, scoop of vanilla icecream and a pot of melted chocolate.   The quarter slice of chocolate drizzled pizza was unbelievable. It's a small slice of plain pita bread with chocolate drizzled on top. Nothing special. Not good. Boring!  The Americocoa tasted like regular cocoa powder mixed with hot water. That's it. It wasn't smooth or decadent either.   Roasting the marshmallows on the mini grill was the best part then having it on the graham cracker and smothered with melted chocolate. Vanilla icecream was good. Everything else was mediocre.   Illegal Chocolate waffle came with melted chocolate, chocolate rice pearls, a scoop of vanilla icecream and slices of caramelized bananas. I was was expecting a great waffle but it was just okay.  The waffle was bland and it didn't have much flavour. It was bit dense and not crispy on the outside either. Even when it was fresh from the kitchen and quickly placed on our table to serve - you would expect it to be piping hot and crispy. Unfortunately, it was not! It would have been nice for the waffle being one of the main components of the dish to be lightly textured, crispier on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Disappointed!  Menu items are expensive and the dishes we ordered aren't that great when given the price point. Semi decadent desserts with a super decadent price tag to match.  Service was attentive. If you asked for a extra cup or napkin they would quickly get it for the table. The servers would check back and refill the water. This place will spoil you with all the chocolate. Definitely a place where you can splurge. It's a fun place to hang out. The experience was enjoyable but the food was just okay. Seriously overrated."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch on family day long weekend. The food was good, and fruit side with fondue dip was great. I liked the server (was a guy), the decor was nice. Overall a good place and would go there again."}
{"text":"So here's the thing...I used to live in Montreal which is where this place originates from and I always enjoyed it there so I was so excited when it opened up around the corner from me. I also went to this specific location several times during its soft opening and always had an amazing experience. Then one day I went with my siblings after they officially opened and had the experience from hell. We're not sure what we did but the guy serving us seemed to hate us from the minute we walked in the door.  We ordered the Bring-It-All-On Sharing Platter for Two or More. The guy basically tossed the bucket of cutlery onto the table. It didn't have enough cutlery for all of us and what it did have was dirty. Yet the guy had so much attitude we didn't even want to point it out to him. Thankfully the platter had a burner for roasting marshmallows so we held the cutlery over that to try and clean it up a bit. However, we did point out that we didn't get the two hot chocolates that was supposed to come with the platter so the guy brought two espresso cups not even half filled and again basically tossed them on the table.   With all that said, his attitude did change at one point and that's when we asked for the bill. He brought it over all smiles and cheer. We weren't too impressed.  All in all, the food is good but not so good that it is worth putting up with this guy's attitude. After this, we really have no interest in returning which is a shame given we were well on our way to becoming regulars."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times already. It's like a 2 min drive my my daughters preschool and 5 min drive from my house. And what I love the most is that all of their meat is halal. So I get whatever egg combo without worries. It is delicious. I've tried their cafe mocha with milk chocolate and it's so yummy. And have always ordered from their savory menu, haven't tried anything sweet yet. You get good portions, very filling."}
{"text":"Generally had a good experience and thoroughly enjoyed the environment. The service was slow due to the large flow of customers but the food was worth it!  Total: 18.5/25  Food Taste: 4/5 - Ordered the Earl Grey Chocolate Fondue and was pleasantly surprised by the taste. It had a great flavor of Earl Grey but was somewhat sweet to our preference. - The waffles and bananas were a great combination with the fondue, but the pineapples were a strange combination and the brownies were very sweet together  Food Presentation/Portion: 4/5 - The dessert was presented on a nice wooden board - The fondue was spilling out of the container so was not as \"aesthetic\" as most would find - Great combination of colors when presented - Portion was enough to share with my friend and I  Customer Service: 2.5/5 - It was very busy when we arrived at 10:00PM on Friday and we waited around 10 minutes to be seated even when there were seats available - We waited another 25 minutes before we received water and menus, and another 15 before the food arrived - Even though the service was slow, it was evident the workers were trying their best to accommodate everyone - It might be better to hire more staff to deal with the business but in general it was slow service.  Environment: 4/5 - Beautiful atmosphere and similar decor to the one downtown. - Enjoyed the lighting and was appropriate to converse for a long time - Has free wi-fi!  Price: 4/5 - I left feeling that the dessert was worth it and my stay was comfortable"}
{"text":"Amazing gem of a dessert place. I'm giving this place a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because I think it's overpriced for what it is, but definitely high on the scale for creativity and quality!   Would definitely recommend this place. Service is great. Food has a wide selection. Rich, flavourful and you're sure to find something you like.   Hot chocolate is very rich, and you could even choose what kind of chocolate you want it made with (dark, milk etc.).  Grilled marshmallows - get it for the experience! They give you a mini grill so you can toast your marshmallows at the table! Pretty awesome. Comes with s'mores, bananas, peanut butter and Nutella mmm!   Nutella crepe- customized it to half banana and strawberry and they made great accommodations for us (since one of us likes strawberries and the other banana) ... pretty good! Amazing and left FULL!!!!    All in al, great experience and would definitely be coming back. In terms of dessert I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Incredible!  I have never loved chocolate as much as when I came to visit Cacao 70 I'm Calgary.  It was so rich, so silky, so mouthwatering."}
{"text":"I'm all about sweets so when I discovered this place, I was more than excited to give it a try.   The location is a bit out of the way and somewhat hidden, but the restaurant itself was nice and quaint. They had a sweets menu and a savoury menu which offers the best of both worlds.  My friend and I decided to go for the Fondues & Fun set which came with a choice of a single or double fondue dip along with fresh fruit, waffle bites and brownie bites. We went for the double and ordered the Matcha Chocolate and Earl Grey Chocolate. Everything was absolutely delicious and this was probably the most enjoyable fondue experience I've ever had! Our server was also very attentive to our needs.   I highly recommended giving this place a visit and I will definitely be back to try some of their other sweets and savoury dishes."}
{"text":"It was sad to discover this place was all hype.   We stopped by for brunch on a weekend and was surprised to find it looked very quiet through the windows. Upon entering, the decor was very cute. After that it went downhill from there. The waiter allowed us to choose our seats out of the 2 tables that were available because the other ones had yet to be cleared due to their \"large lunch rush\" (the dishes were still there when we left. The waiter was in no rush to clear them when he had free time. I'm assuming this is to make it seem like they're busy).   We ordered the granola waffle, smoked salmon scramble, an Americano and a cappuccino. To our surprise, everything was underwhelming and the menu was misleading. The granola waffle came out more like a yogurt parfait with half a waffle on top (see photo). For a granola WAFFLE, i expected more waffle than yogurt. Looking back at the menu it was supposed to be a waffle topped with yogurt, not the other way around. The waffle was bland, cold and soggy. It was definitely sitting for a while from a previous order. The smoked salmon scramble was supposed to come with a panini but we ended up with slices of toast that was put in a panini press instead and the dish was also missing the lemon yogurt sauce (see photo). The salad was undressed and the potatoes were similar to the waffle, cold and soggy. The dish also came with a side of fresh fruit and chocolate dip. The chocolate was great but the fruit looked like it was on the verge of going bad.  Towards the end of our meal, we noticed we had yet to get our drinks. Evidently, the individuals chattering away in the kitchen didn't realize a drink order had been placed. We opted not to get the drinks but the kind waiter who was clearly overwhelmed offered to make them on the house.   There was only 1 waiter/server on the floor while there were 3 other staff in the open kitchen goofing around and yelling over one another. This was a little upsetting when we saw them acknowledging customers waiting to be seated but did nothing about it. They didn't even bother to give the waiter a holler to let him know customers were waiting. Poor customer service on their part but I definitely don't blame the waiter for the slow service, totally understandable seeing as it was only him actually working."}
{"text":"I think this location is still a little bit of a hidden gem as it wasn't busy at all for a Sunday morning brunch when my wife and I came a few weeks ago.  I started with their signature hot chocolate. It comes with two gigantic marshmallows and a chocolate drizzle on top. It was elegant and delicious. One of the best hot chocolates I've had for sure.  For brunch we ordered the triple chocolate fondue for two and the breakfast sandwich to share. This was the right amount of food. The fondue wouldn't have been enough on it's own and the sandwich added some needed protein.  The fondue was excellent. The cup they put the chocolate in is a little misleading. It looks quite large, too large, but it doesn't go all the way to the bottom. You get a mix of fruit, brownies, and waffles to dip. The waffles were really good.  My only complaint about this place is the layout. about half of the tables are right at the front door. In the winter this leads to a big draft every time someone comes in or leaves."}
{"text":"Cute decor and friendly service but price point is ridiculously high and the food is mediocre.  The triple chocolate cake is too sweet and served in a cup (instead of by slice... something that was not mentioned in the menu or by the server while ordering :/   The smoked ham panini that I ordered was soggy and just tasted off... I ended up only finishing half.   I would like to try their ice cream waffles but just cannot justify the $15+ price. I hear their brunch is yummy but again, probably will not be trying it because of the price."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for some dessert. Staff was friendly and the overall ambience is great."}
{"text":"Overall I would say I was rather underwhelmed by my Cacao experience.  The positives about this place is that it smells amazing! The restaurants is also in a great location and the staff is friendly.   The underwhelming part came with the food. I had gotten a veggie wrap, and a brownie dessert. The wrap was quite bland and expensive for what you got. For $10 you get a plane, unseasoned wrap with no side. The dessert (I got what is called a volcano) was not bad but I don't know if it was worth the price. I love desert but this was ok.  I'd say it was all a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the decor and atmosphere at Cacao! The staff are great too! And the chocolate....ummm I'll take everything chocolate please! The chocolate  fondue is what I return for - ordering one of these makes a coffee or lunch date really special:)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love crepes and this place is amazing! I tried the cocoa and fruit crepe with strawberries and dark chocolate. The strawberries were fresh and the dark chocolate had the perfect bitterness! The service and decor were also great, so I would definitely recommend coming here! Do note that it is on the pricier side - the cocoa and fruit crepe ended up to be around $15 after taxes and tips."}
