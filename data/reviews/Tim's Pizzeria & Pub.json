{"text":"Had the Hot Roast Beef samich this time around and it was f*#king killer as always. Best bar food in Falls, hands down."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and have found the beer cold, the food hot, and the prices fair.

Let's be clear: Tim's is shooting for \"neighborhood pizza parlor\" and they're doing a pretty good job of it.

The Pros:  The pizza is good and the owner mixes it up occasionally with some creative offerings.  Try the pizza with stuffed peppers; it's VERY good.  Prices are generally average.

The Cons:  The wait staff kind of runs hot and cold: some are usually very good and others... aren't.  Some of the more creative offerings are pricy.  For example, the pizza with stuffed peppers is substantially more expensive than are other offerings (but worth it).  They can be slow at times."}
{"text":"Bridgette, Ally, and Susan tho...damn. This place has the best wrangs and the greatest ambience...give me a break. I be coming here again and again"}
{"text":"I went a few weeks back for the first time and loved the chicken parmesan. I cannot wait to go back and try their pizza! The wait was a little long, but well worth it! (The oil that comes with the bread reminds me of what I've had in Italy) Delicous!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken ever. and Excellent pizza!! the service is great. (i saw a few complaints) I've never had bad service and I've been there many times. The pricing is fair and we feel like the portions are big. I've referred several friends and all of them are happy customers"}
{"text":"We are here tonight for the first time.  We had a pizza, a meatball sub, onion rings and drinks.  The food is excellent, the service is excellent and we will be back!!  

We have been back several times and tried different things.  The wings (especially spicy garlic) are amazing!  Love the wedding soup too.  This is our new regular place!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many bad bars in my life. But nothing would ever compare to this bar I was at tonight. Not only did the bartender give me dirty looks when I ordered a beer, but the DJ literally kicked me out of the bar when I sang a sublime song. At the harsh demand of the owner. Who made the terrible business decision to kick me and my four friends out. Mind you we made up one half of everyone at the bar. He just started screaming at the DJ and at us. Terrible customer service and overall experience. Plus their food was NASTY."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Tim's Pizzeria is a major disappointment. The pizza took about 40 minutes although we were one of two parties in the restaurant. Our server was unavailable and inattentive; after first giving us our drinks she never came over to our table again nor spoke to us. We had to conduct our business through other workers.  The pizza itself was edible but not much better than that. I would not recommend visiting Tim's pizzeria and will not be returning there."}
{"text":"I plan on visiting 9-2-11,  A few friends said the food is awesome, Good Juke Box, Friendly Bar and Owner.   Cannot wait to get there!   I love small corner establishments.

UPDATE: Been there a few times since. Tim and his family are top notch.  Great for dining in w/kids but nightlife environment after 9:00.  Very cool place. (a little small & A smoking deck or porch would be really cool if they can find someway of pulling that off)  Updated to 4 stars (nobody gets perfect 5)  =)"}
{"text":"I know it looks uninviting from the outside but inside this place is great.  Beer selection is good and pizza is yummy. Has a large crust and I always feel they are generous with the cheese which is good.  Fries are skinny but delicious and hot every time we've had them.  Bartenders are friendly and the service is good.  It is a place good for families as I hear the owner doesn't put up with rowdy language."}
{"text":"On the outside Tim's looks like your average corner bar, and a lot of ways it is. The bar staff is friendly and the beer is cold. But what you don't see from the outside is the amazing food. They have some of the best pizza in the area you really need to try the \"Stuffed pepper pizza\". My son always orders two plates of ravioli. If you go once you will go again."}
{"text":"Great spot for wings! A tad bit dirty but what do yu expect for a hole in the wall bar! Price resonabily!"}
{"text":"Weeknight special each night, and Blue Moon on tap... but the service can run hot and cold.

We live a mile down Bailey and like to walk when the weather is good on Tuesdays for the pitcher and a pizza deal... just be sure you tell the waitress you are actually ordering the deal... you may get a surprise when you get the bill... sigh

Oh... and Blue Moon is charged as an import... I never have thought of the left coast as another country... but it's a couple of bucks.... they throw in some orange slices... I'm happy.

They have an outdoor back patio during the warm seasons... plenty of TV's in the main room... We've never been to the back room.

Broasted chicken and homemade sauce are the highlights of the entrees... the desserts are always great and change regularly.

The White pizza has an odd combinations of toppings that aren't listed on the menu... it seems that they used to have a restaurant in the past and it was a favorite.

They have live music now so we only go when we can get out before it starts. Usually isn't busy on Sat afternoons so it's a nice place to stop for lunch after a long chore day of running around."}
{"text":"As noted by another review, don't let the creepy exterior deter you from trying out Tim's. The inside is very clean and cozy. We just got a house salad and mushroom/pepperoni pizza. The salad was pretty good, lots of mozzarella cheese which a plus in my opinion. Pizza was also very good. The bar appeared well stock and surrounded by flat screens with the expected games on. I'll definitely go back, and if I lived in walking distance I could definitely see this being a cool local place I'd frequent.

If you are wondering why not a 5 star... bathrooms could be fixed up a bit, the house salad dressing was okay, but not the best. Also, I thought the pizza was really good but I've had better, but still really good."}
{"text":"My son lives in the falls. Tried this tonight for the first time while visiting him and his wife. The pizza was fantastic. We got a large pepperoni and sausage and a rigatoni dinner with meat sauce. The place looks dive ish but the quality of the food was really good."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Tim's. It's def our go to for amazing wings!! They are crispy with great hot garlic taste. I can't stand going to a place like panini's, paying premium price and the wings are rubbery. It's very annoying. Not only are the wings awesome but so is the pizza. I consider myself to be somewhat of a pizza fanatic and Tim's surprised me. I don't like undercooked flimsy pizza that appears wet on the bottom. Not here, and they are consistent. It may take a little longer but well worth the wait. Keep in my they have a special on Mondays for $.39 cent wings! Good food, strong drinks and great prices....can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Don't judge Tim's Pizzeria by it's creepy exterior.  It's clean and cozy inside.  They have a half dozen taps, which feature some craft beers, and prices aren't bad.  The pizza, while not top notch,  is in the \"pretty darn good\" category.  I guess what we like about it is that it is a friendly local place to eat and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is a terrible pizza place. I was actually excited when this opened in my neighborhood. I thought that it would be a close good place that we could even walk to. It was so bad that I don't care how close it is, I will never be back. 

We got broccoli and cauliflower pizza and it had marinara sauce? I have never had red sauce with broccoli and cauliflower and I know why now, it's awful. The pizza dough was atrocious, no chew or flavor at all. You could buy a frozen pizza that is better. My husband got Christmas ale and he is sure that it was watered down. 

This place is not worth going and wasting money on."}
{"text":"I'd describe the pizza as light and fluffy.  I usually prefer a heavy pizza like Rocco's or Mark n Philly's, but this was a nice change of pace.  I'll definitely be back.  The wings were standard pizza shop wings and were good."}
{"text":"The next stop on my quest to find the best wings in the area was Tim's Pizzeria & Pub. Tim's came recommended by a couple people so I had high hopes despite the existing mediocre reviews.

I ordered 10 of their buffalo wings and decided to try an order of their stuffed banana peppers as well. The wings were pretty disappointing. There was nothing special about them at all and they were very overcooked to the point that the meat was pretty hard and tasteless. The whole time I was eating them I couldn't help but feel disappointed that I wasn't eating wings from somewhere else.

The only redeeming quality of this meal was the stuffed peppers. The peppers were topped with Italian sausage, cheese and marinara sauce and baked until the cheese melted enough to hold it all together."}
{"text":"The wait staff was prompt at seating us, and that was about it.  After ordering 2 pizzas and 4 waters, we waited 40 minutes before I had to go to the bar to ask how much longer it would be. After another 10 minutes we finally got our pizzas but never got refills on our waters (after being there for over an hour). The waitress was to distracted by some guy at the bar to really care about us.  The pizza quality wasn't bad, but I will never go there again. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"Got the wings based on Yelp reviews and they were fantastic! Got the hot garlic sauce. Pizza was delicious. People are friendly."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! The owner is around often, super friendly and chill. Feels more like a good friends' basement than a hoitey toitey bar. Food is comforting. Karaoke is a blast. Try the garlic fries with cheese for a sure thing!"}
