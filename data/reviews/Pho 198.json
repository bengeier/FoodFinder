{"text":"I enjoy great Pho, I really do. Living off rue Cote des Neiges means we have an embarras de choix and very few of these Pho restaurants disappoint. You can smell the lovely aromas as you round ave Swail or are making your way down from Queen Mary. It's rarely crowded (apart during weekday lunch hour) so if you're not up for a line and bumping elbows at Pho Lien, this is the place to be. 

When I used to eat meat many moons ago, I'd order the delicious grilled chicken Pho that, depending on the season, comes with some extra legumes. Even though I now exclusively enjoy the vegetable (P10) soup, I can not help sample my fellow diners' bowls as virtually every other omnivore I go with opts for the P9. These small bites of grilled chicken add a superb flavor to the broth, really quite unique and incredibly tasty.. The highlights for the vegetable Pho are the generous and varied veggies, from large slices of carrots, cabbage leaves, broccoli and mushrooms, along with the occasional red/orange pepper and snap peas. Add the bean sprouts & thai basil and you've got one satisfying meal.

The service here is very friendly, family run and super quick. Not that one generally waits long for Pho. They also serve tasty imperial rolls (3.50$ for 2) and fresh lemonade if you're craving. I happen to love the red walls and dark lighting, though we sit outside on the terrace too, if it isn't too windy in the summer. 

Note that they no longer take credit cards.

Bonus: a loyalty card, 9th meal/Pho free!"}
{"text":"It was a cold and windy night, so I decided to have some pho with my girlfriend.

My girlfriend had the Saut√©ed chicken with lemon and basil, I had their number 8 pho. Let me start by saying that their rice dishes were very mediocre, and lack of many flavours. The pho, on the other hand, is something to cheer about.

The soup is not clear, I tasted some hints of Chinese five-spice powder. The spices' flavours were not overwhelming, but just right (unlike some places I've been to previously). Their chop suey was fresh, and they offer lemons instead of limes. My only problem with the soup is that it was not hot enough to completely cook the chop sueys. Therefore, the taste of raw chop sueys was really a downer (still finished the whole bowl though).

As for their spring rolls, the texture of the vermicelli was slightly dry, meaning that they were prepared a long time ago. Also, the peanut sauce was not enough for the roll.

The service was very friendly, and very personal as well. With only two waiters it was fast and efficient; we didn't wait too long for our food.

Lastly, the place was extremely cold. Practically everyone inside the restaurant had their coat on.

At any rate, I'd give the place a 3.5/5 for now, and I believe that I will definitely return again. Hopefully, my next experience would be much better."}
