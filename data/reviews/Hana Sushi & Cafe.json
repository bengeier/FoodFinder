{"text":"My friends and I visited on a Friday at around 5:30pm. We were seated almost immediately as the restaurant was almost empty, with one or two other tables. During our visit, the lower conveyor belt (not the monorail) where hot food are supposed to rotate around wasn't in service and thus, cannot judge those food. Once we were seated, the staff gave us a brief explanation on how the ordering and rail works, which is quite nice.

Overall, the experience was okay at best. The quality of their fish/sushi is fairly fresh, better than for sure ayce places, but is obviously not on par with top restaurants of the same category in the Downtown core. However, the main problem with this is that they are charging downtown prices, and that can add up to quite a bit as the portion themselves are incredibly small. At other restaurants, you can get a full roll of 6 pcs for around $7 but at Hana, it will be at least $3 but you will only receive 2 tiny pieces which imo, is not worth your money. The salmon sashimi slices we ordered were also tiny, smaller and thinner than the slices you'll get when you visit an ayce restaurant. Since portions are incredibly tiny, the cost of your meal will accumulate to quite a bit in order to fill your stomach.

In addition, the servers also roamed around, staring at us as we were ordering. My friends and I all mentioned this when we left because we felt like we were being pressure to order as we were being considerate to our wallet lol

Overall, I believe you are paying for the gimmick and not for the sushi. There are many other places where you can indulge your sushi craving, and Hana is not one."}
{"text":"Yelp should allow for zero stars. 

This place is new and my bf and I came here as a japan primer (we're going in a few weeks). 

I made a reservation and when I told them they had me wait- they clearly didn't keep my reservation. They sat us side by side on the \"bar\" tables vs the booths- which was fine because we didn't want to wait.

It's currently 8:30 and I placed my order at 7:48. I've only received two items and bf has only received one. I started this review with 3 stars and it's down to 2.

It's 8:40 and I've finished the three sushi things I've ordered but my Ramune soda hasn't come yet. I pressed the call button 5 minutes ago.

It's 8:51 (see photo) and my bf is enraged and starving because only two of his items came. We placed orders at 7:45. We called for the bill and peaced out to find a quick-eats option for him. 

Never again."}
{"text":"It was fun and a nice restaurant. The conveyor wasn't running when we were there but the monorail quickly delivered the food we ordered from the tablet. Everything came within five minutes. The food was typical Toronto sushi restaurant fare. I will come back."}
{"text":"Heard this place from my friend, and I was having a high expectation to check it out. There is a reason I'm giving 1 Star, not even 1.5 Star to this restaurant.
The restaurant is very big actually, however the dining area is only fitting about 1/3 the restaurant, and the rest are empty. The restaurant is probably newly opened, and the management is really weird, though the staff is friendly, which is the only part earning the Star.
In term of the monorail sushi idea, it is not new actually if you have been into restaurant like Fune in Toronto, which is way more high ending compare to this one. The monorail's decoration is also very cheap, there are just some random photos of Japanese sticking on the monorail's wall. 
In term of the food, I'm extremely disappointed, though the sushi are not too bad, but extremely average when the price is asking high as 5.99 for two pieces. With this price, I can really go to other sushi spots for authentic sushi with authentic Japanese atmosphere. This restaurant is running by Chinese owner I think, though there is nothing wrong with Chinese ownership, but it is NOT authentic Japanese food experience with this price if you gone to any other places like Nami or Fune.
Overall, the restaurant is way below my expectation, and it is cool to try the monorail experience, but it is just not worth the time and money to spend a real meal inside."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch at around 3pm. We were promptly seated and taught how to order. The food came within ten minutes. 

I ordered the salmon sashimi, octopus nigiri, scallop nigiri, salmon roe nigiri, and a chirashi bowl. 

The octopus was good, but you can't mess up octopus.  

The salmon sashimi was on par with the AYCE restaurants, nice that it came out cold. 

The scallop shocked me, they were big and plump. This was one of the highlights of the meal. 

The chirashi was good. There was plenty of sashimi, although I found the rice to have a little too much vinegar. 

The other highlight of the meal was the salmon roe, it was large and sweet. It was delicious. 

Overall, I was satisfied with the food and enjoyed the experience. The only part I don't agree with is the a la carte prices for AYCE quality for some dishes."}
{"text":"Read about this place through either blogTO or Narcity and it's near work so thought we'd try it out after work. There's actually a very small cafe connected to the restaurant under the same owner. Food wasn't fresh. Food was pricey. The only thing which made this place cool was the monorail themed conveyor belt and that's it. I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"Quiet an experience but kinda disappointed. 
Good: 
Clean and bright environment. The kitchen was quick but I went in around 4pm which is not a typical peak hour. The conveyor belt was pretty cool.
Disappointments:
The average AYCE quality food costs me a fortune as I wasn't really thinking about the price (can't do math while eating). I rather go to a decent AYCE place for the price I've paid for same quality of food and better selection. Plus you have to pay 15% tip for the service which wasn't existed --- not because the service are bad, the waitress are actually pretty nice. But you just don't need any service for the entire meal. From what I heard the conveyor belt sushi was designed to lower the cost, but I can't feel the same way here."}
{"text":"Food quality is on par of AYCE places with higher than normal prices. I'd say wait until the hype dies down and take a visit just for the trains. Different but the plates really add up. Among us three, it was $40 a person."}
{"text":"Despite seeing the horrendously negative reviews about this, my curiosity got the best of me, I just couldn't help but to check it out for myself.

The space is clean, bright, spacious, and has a very high ceiling. Everything went smoothly, and ordering was simple through a tablet mounted to the table. Menu is simple, and good came very fast.

Food quality wise, it was your average AYCE kinda sushi place. There were few interesting pieces worth trying, like the roast beef nigiri sushi, and the bonito grapefruit nigiri.

Very good and interesting experience.

Too bad nothing was rotating at the conveyer belt, because probably they're not busy enough to warrant that yet.

Also disappointing was that they expect you to pay 15% tips minimum (as per their credit card machine), even though there was minimal human interaction.

It's like being asked to tip at a vending machine. 

I'd rather you just raise the price of each dish and pay your staff more than to do this. If you're going to copy Japan, don't go half way. 

Because of this and the average food quality, 3 stars only."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and don't come here. I didn't expect this to be anything like the conveyor belt sushi in Japan..  but they obviously used the belt as a gimmick and nothing more. Food is not great at all, and also the bottom belt that should have food readily available isn't even utilized. You can only order the dishes you want and not grab off the belt like restaurants in Japan."}
{"text":"I came with my best friend tonight and it took us 15 mins to get a table even though there were empty tables. We ordered 5 items and waited 20 mins for it and then we tried to rush the order and it came in 5 mins. Unfortunately 2 of the 5 items were wrong order. They also sent us an extra plate and we had to pay for it. We proceeded to get our checks and we waited 10 mins and nobody came so we ended up going to the front desk to pay. We paid a total of 32 dollars for 6 items. For the amount we paid the food was definitely not worth it. Side note they charge you for tea. The quality of the food was so so and we will not come again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I can tell that the quality of the sushi is better than other restaurants, and definitely better than what you find at a grocery store. Even the bento box at the front counter looks amazing, and for the price is reasonable for what you get.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant..!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing a cool blogTO about the conveyor belt idea. However the experience was below my expectations. In total, I had 2 rolls and 1 piece of salmon sashimi, and one \"seared\" salmon sushi that was basically fully cooked. Total came to $10 for the 4 pieces. The service was also super slow. Food always came one dish at a time (2 pieces of sushi)."}
{"text":"Lots of negative reviews, so was definitely hesitant at first. For all those on the fence, don't be! It was a good experience overall. In fact, we tried almost everything in the menu... 

MUST TRY: fried squid (literally the best fried squid I've had, and I don't normally like fried food)

Best bang-for-the-buck: seared salmon 

For those that are adventurous: pickled small octopus (surprisingly really good! Picked it for the shits and giggles). 

Also recommended: beef sushi, bonito with grapefruit juice 

Cons: pricier than AYCE, the other dishes were average (probably not worth the price)."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst sushi restaurants I've been to. The quality of the food is just saddening. Yellowtail sashimi tastes really dry and flavourless. Every sushi plate is overpriced, like 6 dollars for only two pieces of red dragon roll. The seller of the restaurant is \"conveyor\", while there's literally no food on it."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends, more out of curiosity, not really expecting much from the food.  Both friends have been to many conveyer belt sushi places before in Asia, and I had no experience whatsoever, so that made for an interesting experience.

There is both a conveyer (bottom) and a monorail (top).  The conveyer belt has food that goes around for you to pick up.  There are two monorails since the restaurant is sort of divided into two.  You need to press the button up top to return the monorail back to the kitchen after you pick up your dishes.  Dishes are coloured according to the price -- there's a placard on the tables indicating how much each coloured dish costs.  There is also a Samsung Tab tablet on the table for you to order food on demand.  By the end of the meal, the server will come and count the plates and double check with you about the numbers before giving you the bill.

Overall, the experience was interesting and fairly gimmicky.  My friends felt it was a good imitation of the conveyer belt experience (to improve it, they told me that there needed to be more food on the conveyer belt... from what I saw, it was only maybe the same 3 dishes rotating around the whole time we were there for dinner).

The food itself is nothing special.  If anything, it is more expensive than food you can get at the a la carte restaurants.  Not sure if I'd come back  here for the food."}
{"text":"Good service, the lady there was smiling the whole time I feel very comfortable. I saw some bad reviews about the food is slow but I didn't experience that at all. As a matter of fact it was pretty quick"}
{"text":"After seeing all the mediocre reviews on Yelp, I still wanted to check the place out because it's Canada's first monorail sushi! I visited at lunch on a weekday, so the service was fast and there was no wait. 

The quality is comparable to AYCE but they do offer a few variety of fish that you can't find at AYCE. Prices are a little steeper than what I would have hoped for given the quality. The lunch and dinner menu is the same, so I would say dinner time has better value. There was a strand of dust or something on one of the nigiris, so it would have been nice if they covered the plates when sending it over.  

The restaurant is renovated nicely and is bright with big windows. Hana Sushi is definitely a fun experience and reminds me of Japan!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. It's too bad because it is a great idea to finally have this in the city. It's just the service and the quality of the food is horrendous. Worse than the typical sushi buffets out there. Plus I barely had my share and paid more than what you would pay for a all you can eat buffet on a weekend dinner. 

Sorry!"}
{"text":"If food quality is most important factor for you to choose the restaurant, please do not even try this one. They have an interesting train thing, but I don't understand why I should try train thing instead of good food. One of the worst sushi I've ever had in Toronto. If you don't trust my review, go and try."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. First, the tea is not free, and the waiters failed to disclose this. They are $2 each. Second, we ordered the seared scallop nigiri and waited for 30 minutes, only to find out after that they were sold out. That was our last dish so we waited for half an hour with no notification they were sold out. Third, watch your bill; they overcharged us. We had already paid via credit card, and they refunded us the difference in cash once we pointed out the discrepancy. And finally, the food is mediocre at best. You can get much better quality sushi from an AYCE restaurant for less."}
{"text":"Clean place. Service is very slow. Price on higher end. Part per order.  Ingredients were totally not fresh.  Some of them were so fridge bitten that that actually fell apart when I picked it up.  The sushi was not properly former. The rice targeted stale. Totally not worth the money.  There is nothing beyond the conveyor belt.  Even the tablets you use to order died on us.  No tea to start. No serviettes. They forgot to refresh the supplies at the table. Tables very narrow. We kept kicking each other.  The green onions they used in the dishes were not hooked and became very spicy.  Neighborhood quite sketchy."}
{"text":"Updating my review after having had time to consider it:

This place is lovely. The food sucked. The seaweed salad was neon green -- obviously dyed beyond recognition -- and there was really nothing else to recommend it except the fun monorail. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews, I decided to give this place a try because 1) I live right beside it, 2) I wanted the monorail/conveyer belt sushi experience, and 3) I love sushi.

This is not the place to visit if you want tasty and affordable sushi. Not only is the food extremely expensive, it is low quality and definitely not worth it.

The food comes on different coloured plates, and each plate has it's value: white plate is $1.99, green is $2.99, blue is $3.99, red is $5.99, and black is $7.99.

Most sushi and sashimi items are $3.99, while fried foods like squid and chicken are $5.99. The sushi and sashimi portions are extremely small (about 2-3 pieces/plate), and is NOT worth $4. I ordered the salmon sashimi - there were three sad pieces that were probably the size of my pinky - and it costed me $3. Some people posted pictures of their sashimi that were large and thick, I got probably 1/3 of that.

The tempura we ordered came without any dipping sauce. The fried chicken tasted very odd, and I'm scared to try it again because I'm not sure if it was off due to seasoning or because it had gone bad. The sushi rolls were laughable - 3 tiny pieces of California roll for $4!

Also, they charge you $2 each for tea, which is usually free at any other Japanese or Chinese restaurant. 

The conveyer belt does not start until 6pm, so between 11am (when they open) and 6pm, it's all up to the monorail (what you order from the tablet). They also don't start the fryer for tempura until 11:30am, so if you wanted to get an early lunch, you'd only be able to order sushi and sashimi.

The total for two people came to $60, without tax or tip, and we didn't feel very satisfied from the food. It felt odd tipping nearly $10 when all the server did was show us to the table and bring us the bill (since the monorail did all of the \"serving\").

I would not recommend this restaurant. If you're really interested in giving the monorail a try, make sure you come not hungry so you don't rack up the bill ordering tiny plates of mediocre food and tea. Toronto has many other sushi restaurants that are both higher in quality and better priced. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I was really attracted to the Japanese style bullet train order and delivery service which brought me there. It surely is attractive but it's more of a one time experience as the quality of the food is not worth its price. Every time I ordered a dish it felt like I'm paying triple the price for all you can eat quality sushi. Overall I enjoyed the theme and environment and got this crossed off my bucket list :)"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed that I only have 5-6 dishes but including taxes and tips was $30.00!   I did Not really good experiences especially the portion of the sushi was small that I ordered was not very good experience that ends up very disappointing for my experience with this restaurant even owned but a Chinese restaurant owner in a Japanese Sushi restaurant.  On the positive side that a monorail delivers from a Kitchen to my table #7 very efficiently.  After I pay the bill, I felt very hungry afterwards.  I would NOT recommend to my family and friends to come to this Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a real shame. This place isn't very good. But it has a ton of potential. We ate most of the nigiri menu and a few other odds like the pickled octopus and fried caeplin. 

1) The fish quality is poor. This is problem #1. It's not AYCE quality, but it's not far off. Definitely needs to improve in this location if they want to be a success.

2) Variety is good. There is a lot of variety on the menu and some less common stuff. Feels like there is a bit of a Taiwanese style on the menu, a few dishes that are more common in sushi places there than in Japan. The menu variety is good.

3) Nigiri cuts varied wildly. Order 2 orders of the same thing and you'll get very different fish cuts. This isn't great.

4) Rice was a bit over cooked, but well seasoned which I appreciate.

5) Soy sauce was watered down, and the replacement soy sauce was equally watered down. This is super strange, and at this price point feels almost insulting.

6) The night we went service was fast and food came out very quickly. No complaints here.

7) We found a hair in a nigiri rice, which is... pretty terrible. Oops.

Overall the place has hope, but the fish quality and consistency in the preparation need to improve."}
{"text":"if it was just for the quality and value of the food, I would give hana a solid 3 stars. it's really not bad. there are some interesting items and everything that I had was fresh. unlike others, I didn't have to wait particularly long for anything.

although you mostly interact with the tablet, the human service was fine. having been to similar places before, I did find the tablets a bit laggy.

anyway, the place is unique and a blast for kids. I give it an extra star just for the trains."}
{"text":"Soft opening recently with innovative train delivery.

Super slow delivery by a high speed train... don't come until it's fully geared up to serve (maybe when it's officially open)

Waited for more than 35 mins for the first plate which I only can rate it as AYCE quality - knowing this place charges by plate and different colour plate has different price - that being said, it charges more with smaller portion."}
{"text":"Came here for the monorail, everything seemed fun from online.
The monorail itself is cute, but that's it, everything else is unexpectedly disappointing.
1. The food is not fresh and they taste like they're directly from the fridge. Some appearances are so bad that you regretted ordering them.
2. Didn't give us enough soy sauce plates.
3. Didn't give us napkins.
4. The iPad ordering system blacked out even when plugged in...
5. Duplicating orders and extra orders
Honestly, if they don't have the monorail, I doubt if they can survive even in the short term. Their food quality is the same if not worse than take out sushi. Monorail itself is not at all efficient in delivering all orders, waiting time is concerning.
This is a very disappointing experience, won't consider visiting again, can't even recommend it to any of my friends:("}
{"text":"Went here with a friend because we wanted to be adventurous. You can definitely can get more for your money at other AYCE sushi restaurants or at other al a carte places. 

There is only one monorail on each side, so you may be waiting for your food for a while, depending on how busy they are. There wasn't much going around the conveyor belt, mostly soba noodles and drinks. They ended up having to cover the soba noodles in plastic wrap because they had been going around the conveyor belt for a long time. 

It was nice to experience a conveyor belt sushi but it can be quite pricey. We both ended up spending around $50 each and were still hungry. I liked the salmon sashimi, but the last few plates still had bones in them and I ended up having them pull out. :( 

They gave us stamp cards because we ordered twelve plates each. We'll be able to claim a 2.99 plate for free, but I don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Pros:
Conveyor belt was pretty fun. 
Store decor was gd, bright. 
And waitress was nice.

Cons:
Food was okay fresh but overpriced."}
{"text":"I came  here last  week with some friends. The experience was good enough that we planned another outing here in a couple of months . What got us here was the concept of sushi on a conveyor belt that was shaped like  monorail.
We came for the company and ambiance and its pretty good.  Hana  has some pretty good dishes . I  recommend that one tries   what  they have not tried before.  We got the sushi rolls , and some  beef and salmon dishes. 
The food is good overall, fresh, well presented and we like the concept  of the conveyor belt. We will be back and  will order other dishes  we did not get to try"}
{"text":"We knew of the bad reviews before we went, but still wanted to go because of the monorail idea. 

There was no wait at all on a Tuesday at 12pm, many free tables.

We were a 5 people group and we got say in a 4 persons booth with an extra chair on the side, everyone was comfortable with the seating. However, the tablet for ordering is not removable from the edge of the table on the other side, so looking at the menu for the 3 folks that sat further away became a problem. 

You can only order 4 items at a time before you sent in the order. The order took no longer than 5 mins each time after we ordered. 

Food quality is not bad, but not amazing either. 

We were being accused of putting a plate back to the monorail at one point. After the staff further look into it, she said we took the tempura basket but not the plate itself. We thought we made a mistake, but upon looking at videos we took, the tempura basket DID NOT came with a plate.

We had separate bills. For myself, I had 4 plates of sushi, each had 2 pieces nigiri, no tea (knowing that it's not free). The bill came out to $20 after tax and tips. I'll probably go to an AYCE instead for next time as the price is a lot steeper and quality about the same."}
{"text":"Despite all the bad reviews, I still wanted to give Hana a try for the atmosphere (I fell for the gimmicky monorail). I don't really have much to add since I am in complete agreement with the other reviews.

The Sweet Shrimp had absolutely no taste to it. The Japanese Style Fries didn't have enough sauce. The first piece of Cuttlefish I had was alright. The second piece so hard I had to spit it out because I couldn't bite into it. Salmon sashimi was alright - just your average AYCE quality.

Most of our food came pretty quickly with the exception of the BBQ Eel and Avocado Roll. This was our last item to arrive and it took ~25 mins for those three pieces. It was probably the tastiest thing we had all night though. I think the Chirashi ($7.99) was the most worth it for what you're paying. Sushi rice wasn't very flavourful.

ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE: We made a reservation for 8:30pm on a Saturday. It was a full house but we didn't have to wait too long for our table. The servers were nice and friendly. The restaurant itself was spacious and brightly lit with high ceilings. If you sit in the middle area, the top conveyor is the one with the bullet train that brings you your order and the bottom conveyor is one that you can just take from. If you sit on the sides/along the wall, both your conveyor belts are the bullet train.

I also got a stamp card for a free $2.99 plate on the next visit. This is a great idea to get customers to return but I know I won't be using it based on this experience. However, I think Hana has a good concept with lots of potential; they just need to improve the quality of their food."}
