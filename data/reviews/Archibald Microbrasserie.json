{"text":"The Archibald Brasserie was a pretty nice place to kill 3 hours between planes. Can't comment on the food, but the atmosphere was pleasant for an airport bar, the beer was pretty good, though a bit pricy, and the service was friendly. I enjoyed the IPA and my wife liked the whitbier. Was looking forward to their beer again on the return trip, but alas, they are in the Canadian zone of YUL and customs is a pain. The US zone could seriously use a place like this, you hear me?"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.   Slowest service I've seen in a long time. Also some of the rudest employees. While eating lunch, they came by to put two tables together (one of which was the table we were eating at) tried to clean them, and then left dirty rags on our table and walked away.   Food was mediocre at best. Try one of the other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Nice for an airport best cheese plate I've had at an airport ... First cheese plate at an airport did I mention it's at the airport"}
{"text":"A relatively decent restaurant in the airport, compared with what YUL airport has offered. I ordered the chicken butter poutine: the French fries were good but the sauce was average. My friend ordered a tuna tarte which was better than mine. The cream brûlé was a bit too sweet for me and the cafe au lait was okayish."}
{"text":"Très bien si vous avez quelques heures à tuer avant de décoller. Bon choix de burgers, bières et bien sûr Poutine! Pas trop d'attente et service rapide et de qualité."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was slow. They made some mistakes in our plates as well. I ordered an omelet with a choice of 3 toppings and egg whites. It was served with potatoes and toasts.  Overall the restaurant is a good spot to go to before your flight.  Just be patient and enjoy the food when it gets to your table!"}
{"text":"J'aurais aimé bien goûter à quelque chose offert dans le menu mais l'attente était tellement longue avant d'avoir une place pour s'asseoir et après on s'est fait ignorer par le personnel pendant une longue période! Il y avait facilement 4-5 membres du personnel sur le plancher.   Il faut considérer que les gens qui viennent à ce resto n'ont pas énormément de temps car ils ont un vol à prendre. Nous sommes partis après plusieurs minutes, on nous avait même pas servi de l'eau."}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos which were fairly well topped with a variety of toppings.  Once you get through the top layer you'll find yourself with a lot of plain chips.  Being a traveler I was mildly impressed with the quality of toppings as opposed to other hotel or airport restaurants.  It does have a nice atmosphere for an airport and probably one of the better options in the Montreal airport."}
{"text":"Located outside gate 50, this restaurant stands out due to its outside decor.  There is \" outdoor seating\" which looks like dining on a sidewalk.  Plenty of indoor seating, booths and tables.   The decor is very \"wildernessy\".  I am sitting under a moosehead.   I am going to name him Pierre.   The lights are mini chandeliers adorned with moose horns.   Booths are covered with black and red checkered fabric like outdoors shirts.  Metal squares align the ceiling.   There are TVs, one has the flight departure gate schedule, one has hockey (of course) and I do see the reflection of a football game.     On the menu is 3 pages of  craft beers, mostly Belgium. In fact microbrasserie (micro brewery)  is in the name.    The food is traditional French Canadian cuisine like poutine and duck. The pizzas look and smell delicious!     Free WIFI througout the airport."}
{"text":"L'Archibald est désormais un classique pour les voyageurs. L'endroit est convivial, mais prenez votre mal en patience pour le service aka n'y allez pas si vous êtes sur le point de manquer votre vol.  Nous avons commencé notre repas avec un mimosa (tsé assez festif). J'ai choisi le sandwich au poulet fumé maison et mon amie a choisi le tartare Archibald. Mon sandwich était super bon. Seul bémol, si vous hésitez entre les frites et la salade, choisissez les frites. La vinaigrette qui accompagne la salade manque cruellement d'assaisonnement. C'était le cas aussi du tartare, mais une demande de sauce forte à la serveuse a réglé la situation.  Les prix sont assez élevés. Le prix à payer pour un restaurant d'aéroport j'imagine.  Bref, belle expérience, mais heureusement que nous n'étions pas pressés!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place to wait before boarding. The burgers were excellent however the pasta so so. I is way better anyway than all other lil kiosks around that are overpriced"}
{"text":"Great selection of microbrews.   Prompt service.   Nachos were freshly toasted with a generous amount guacamole.  Great value for airport dinning and big step up for YUL."}
{"text":"Flavourless onion soup. McCain Superfries. Poutine without real gravy (beer jus). Pizzas are okay. Server never bothered to explain the order of beers on my taster. Huge price gouge (even by airport standards)."}
{"text":"Super good place, good ambiance and good music, not too noisy. If you are able ask for a captain chair with the blankets they are sooooo comfy. Price are good. Had the archibald burger, it was good a bit disapointed on the patty, as it was a bit small, looks like it was frozen. If you ask for the same burger, ask them not to put to much of their special sauce, as it kill the rest of your burger. Fries were awesome, as they are made here. The chef is very present in her restaurent going around asking the guest if everything is ok. Overall will come back and recommand for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! This place is absolutely disgusting. I came here for atmosphere and thought it looked cool but don't be fooled by appearance. I told the hostess and she did nothing. She acted like it was normal! Who does that?! She probably lives that way. So gross"}
{"text":"Honnetement, je trouve que c'est le meilleure spot de l'aeroport pour manger et prendre une verre avant un vol ! La bouffe est très bonne et la bière est excellente !   J'ai mangé le trio de tartare et ils étaient délicieux !"}
{"text":"Sat waiting for service for 15 minutes while three separate newly arrived guests were served. Had to leave to I would have time to make my flight."}
{"text":"We stopped here during a layover and the food was spectacular! Especially after a long evening of traveling, the cozy ambience and flavorful food really wowed us. We ordered the Prosciutto and Mushroom Linguine and the Lamb Shank. The linguine was perfectly seasoned and the lamb was savory and fell right off the bone. It was a wonderful meal, followed by the delicious Archibald Brownie. Definitely would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Had an hour and a half waiting for flight. Was looking for a nice breakfast other then the usual timmies or Starbucks.   Had indifferent service at best. Food was fine but..."}
{"text":"Was there this past Monday. Wasn't greeted (to be seated) by anyone when we arrived. Were told off for not waiting to be seated when we tried to ask someone inside the resto. Was finally seated and waited for a wait person. Moved to the bar after all the wait staff avoided us and then finally left the bar after that staff ignored us as well. Too bad I couldn't have reviewed the food."}
{"text":"Great service / great decor / French accent on the gals is great / classy spot - nice level of sophistication that gives the airport a good look .    Good beer / great nachos for 2 for $17 ."}
{"text":"Pricy and the food is so so. I tried the blood sausage and it was a mistake. The service was great though!"}
{"text":"Wow, where to start?! I've had good experiences at this resto before but tonight was bad service at its worst. First my salad had rotting lettuce which the waitress agreed to exchange. The replacement salad came with more rotten lettuce, just a little less. The beer sampler I ordered never came after asking about it THREE times. The waitress finally brought the wrong (single) beer... I let her know that wasn't what I ordered and she agreed to bring me the proper order. To top it off, she said she would come back to explain what each of the six samplers were which she never did. I realize this is one bad waitress or perhaps a good waitress on a bad night but nonetheless, not impressed. Why is good service the exception nowadays? Not sure whether I'll return to this \"high on decor, little on substance\" wannabe hipster micro-brewery."}
{"text":"At the airport, I have to kill and I am hungry. My sister and I wanted a sit down meal, and enjoy the down time.   The hostess is super sweet. The restaurant has feeling of being in woods with fantastic Latino pop music with subtlety.   Our server was fantastic, helpful with my choice of wine. My drink and food came very quickly. My white wine perfect; onion rings with coarse maple syrup delightful, and my tuna tataki was good with mango, coriander and kale salad, maybe more spices would made the whole dish a perfection.   If we are flying somewhere thru Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport, do pass by here!"}
{"text":"After the quickest check in of life We decided to celebrate with one last montreal meal before we took off and we thought let's try this place and not our normal Spot where my friend works. As soon as we walked up we were greeted by a petite brunette hostess who showed us to a sad looking table in the back which wasn't exactly my ideal spot to celebrate before leaving. We asked if we could have a booth and she stated it's only for groups of 4 or more which we weren't but decided we wanted the Booth as the restaurant was empty, she gave us the booth and told us rudely that she will move us if people came in which we understood 100% (nobody came)  We had a nice waitress who brought us a little plastic Container of olives right away, we ordered two ipas and a burger and poutine. Drinks came right away a bit sour for my liking but went well with the food. Food was okay but needs improvements. The burger was of good quality meat but it had no flavour or seasoning the meat and needed a few extra packets of ketchup. The poutine was good but the sauce ruins it, for 17 dollars you don't get many curds which is a bit of a let down but I didn't expect much more than that for airport food."}
{"text":"L'omelette au chorizo et juste trop excellente ! Avec un café brésilien c'est juste parfais ;)"}
{"text":"A quick stop here for dinner between connecting flights was a decent airport food experience. Their IPA was quite good, if not memorable, and there were probably eight of their other beers available on tap. The same with their food.   When in Montreal, smoked meat lovers search out this local specialty, and the closest thing on offer was the Reuben. In actual fact, it was a grilled ham and cheese sandwich on white bread with some nondescript sauerkraut on the side, a far cry from what I had originally asked for! The pleasant waiter proceeded to spin a yarn about how the cost of smoked beef in Quebec had skyrocketed over the past three years, which I might have believed after a few more IPA's... To their credit, the side Caesar salad was really good. My partners poutine was simply okay with a rather bland gravy, a few cheese curds,  and only a dusting of the additional meat topping.   All in all, a good spot for an airport instead of the usual fast food chain restaurants, but I'd think long and hard about stopping in at one of their other locations. Decent service, okay prices, but again, nothing special."}
{"text":"Airport food options - with this context it fits in as a 4 star for me. I was in no rush by the service (bilingual) was very polite and nice and quick. Not sure I'd go here in a rush to be safe though. The atmosphere is very good too. Prices are as expected; in the airport nothing is cheap. The beer is 3 stars, especially for the price. I had the spicy burger and it was well executed. My partner was pleased with her burger too."}
{"text":"Beer was good.  Food was a miss.  Simple burger and fries.  Looked good. However, the burger seemed microwaved or reheated.  Little too chewy for a fresh burger, even the colour was that grey...too bad for $18.  Lounge and chairs cozy.  Don't get the burger."}
{"text":"Comme tous les restaurants dans les aéroports il faut servir vite : le client que perd son avion car son repas est arrivé en retard je ne pense pas qu'il soit le plus content des clients.  Aucun soucis à se faire : bon service, souriant , efficace et rapide !  N'ayant pas très faim j'ai pris un tartare au deux saumons en entrée , accompagnée d'une salade verte (supplément). Petit (je le savais en avance, étant considérée une entrée ) mais très bonne ! La salade était parfaitement assaisonnée.  Rien a dire, c'était bon et rapide ! Mieux que manger un sandwich industriel assis sur un fauteuil et attendant l'avion au gate !  Ps: pour mieux vous servir, a l'accueil on vous demande si vous avez au moins 40 min avant l'embarquement . En 25 minutes j'avais fini et je suis parti ! ;)"}
{"text":"I spent the weekend in Quebec and chose this restaurant because it was closest to my hotel. I knew I would already like this place the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was really nice. It was French cuisine with a mix of American. A little bit of a language barrier between our table and the servers but they tried their best. My friends ordered the burgers and I tried their fish and chip platter. We had no complaints and the food was very well made. Will return again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was OK, nothing special, but service was terrible - waited a long time to have my order taken, never asked if I wanted more coffee, never offered water, would still be waiting for my check if I hadn't stood up. I'm sure waiters here get poor tips sometimes because of travelers using pocket change for tips, but that does not excuse poor service."}
{"text":"For airport food there's not much selection. If you have time to kill it's a nice place to sit down and grab a hot meal. Food average, server was polite.  Better than a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"Didn't get so far as a meal, so I'll rate what I saw.  My hostess (who had about as much tact as a mule) insisted I sit at the bar (the restaurant was empty--I preferred a table but alas). Once sat down, I was overwhelmed by the smell of a dirty bar. Thinking it was in my head (I'm sensitive to this kind of smell--worked in restaurants for years and know what a dirty drain smells like), I sat down and stared at the menu. The problem: I couldn't even look at the menu because I was so distracted by the fruit flies! My appetite was completely gone, had to leave and am writing this review from L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel just a few metres away, where maybe it isn't as nicely decorated and the menu isn't as extensive, but at least it's clean!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty tasty tomato basil pizza here.  But they promised a 30 minute service which was grossly inaccurate.  The food came on cue but the server was never to be seen again.  You can't be an airport restaurant  without a mind for speediness and that requires attentive servers.   Overall,  good food but I would be careful if you have a tight flight window."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, beer is lacking.  Best thing about this place is that they are open at around 5am so you can get an early morning snap on before your next flight.  Other than that, it's just a momumental waste of money."}
{"text":"Good place to eat at the airport. Their bolognese pasta was pretty good and their decor is cozy. Service was great, friendly and attentive. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Four stars under the category of \"I realize this is the airport and do not have ridiculous expectations.\"  That being said, I managed to get in here, receive surprisingly decent service, and order a burger without worrying if I would miss my flight. The food came out within 10 minutes after I ordered it.  Was it the best burger ever? No, but it was moist, fairly tasty, and served with fries that were actually hot.  Prices fall in the 20$ out the door for main plates without drinks. They have a variety of options (including salads) for food, as well as a comprehensive alcohol menu.  Again, service and food are good considering that this is the airport. (You probably didn't clear security just to have a night out at the airport!!!)"}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm while waiting to catch a flight. The hostess asked if we had about 45 minutes before our flight to eat and then we were seated quickly. The decor...was  cool, if not almost tongue in cheek CANADIAN. Lots of plaid. Since we had a long flight ahead of us we stuck to apps and tried the poutine with bison and the Mediterranean salad. Both were around $15. For airport food, I really wasn't disappointed. The fries in the poutine were fresh and the gravy was delish. The salad had a lot of decidedly un-Mediterranean flaves going on but top anything with crispy pancetta and I'll give it a thumbs up. Service was fast and friendly. Service is in both French and English if you're not familiar with Quebec."}
{"text":"Overall, mediocre at best. Gets rounded up from 2 1/2 stars. It is the airport, which gives the benefit of rounding up instead of down. The service was great!  We had burger, Caesar salad, pasta and and tuna tartare. The burger was dense and tough. The salad was ok--leave it to the Canadians to put bacon and capers on a Caesar!!!  The best thing was the poutine we had...gravy was rich and buffalo meat was tender. Beer was so so. Probably would try something different if I am back at the airport."}
{"text":"Un très beau restaurant pour passer le temps d'attente avant un vol! On peut y manger autre chose qu'un p'tit beigne et un café, donc c'est parfait pour ceux qui partent le soir après l'heure du souper!!  Les prix sont plus élevés, mais quand même abordables!"}
{"text":"Le restaurant de l'aéroport de Montréal par excellence. On s'y arrête forcément vu qu'il n'y que celui là qui a l'allure d'un vrai resto. Le décor est très typique canadien et les plats y sont variés. Évidemment la microbrasserie vous propose toute sa déclinaison de bières ce qui offre une bonne combinaison pour accompagner judicieusement votre plat. Pour ma part, le tataki de cerf était correct à un prix raisonnable, de même que le burger \"Dodu\", le choix d'une valeur sûre.  Le goût et l'accent du pays avant de quitter le domicile ou les vacances selon le voyageur au départ de YUL."}
{"text":"This was one of the only sit-down restaurants around where we were, and it seemed pretty inviting. The big seats at the front were all taken, so we sat inside. It looked like it had a very Canadian theme, with a lot of dark wood, red and dark brown accents, moose and other nature-related decor. The music, however, didn't match at all, since it was really loud, Top 40/pop from the 90s, which I usually really enjoy, but because of the large seats, I was seated a lot further away from my husband and it was hard enough to hear him without having to lean forward every second.  My husband was really craving a poutine, so he ordered the only one that was on the menu. It had cheese curds, smoked meat, pickled onions, beer gravy, mustard, and this hard caramel toffee thing. Honestly, I found it really weird. I had a bite and it was absolutely not the Montreal poutine we're used to, and though I always like to try remixed versions of different foods, this was a miss for the both of us. The pickled onions were the kind that you find in shawarmas and seemed odd instead of white/yellow onions, the dijon mustard was overwhelming, and the super sweet toffee thing was soooo strange to me, since the rest was savoury and it was so out of place in terms of flavor. The portion was huge, but for nearly $20, it should've been!  I got the beef tataki since they ran out of the deer, which was super disappointing. I also found it expensive for the portion size that I got (3 pieces), but that's usually the case for tataki. The beef was more of a medium rare than just a sear, but had some nice Asian flavors, with sesame and maybe some ginger/soy. The salad was really good, with arugula, cherry tomatoes, fresh dill, large Parmesan shavings, and some olive oil.  Our server was really great, friendly and attentive (one of the main reasons for the third star), but the food was just okay, and for the price point, way too expensive for the quality/quantity, depending on what you're eating. If you want to eat here but also save some cash before flying off somewhere else, I'd suggest just grabbing a couple of beers and a snack to share."}
{"text":"Great place! With all the airport food and drinks (wrapped sandwiches, burgers, mass beer...) this is a welcome change: micro brews, great food (had the bison appetizer - great!! The poutine - ok). Which more airports would feature these types of pub/restaurants over the cheapo chain stuff."}
{"text":"It's a pity this brew pub has a location only at the Montreal airport, but now I'm looking forward to get a pint in it when sending back visitors. Nice and refreshing beers, they also have a six glasses tasting option that can make you miss your flight. The beers are reasonably priced for an airport where drinks are known to be ridiculously expensive. Haven't tried the food yet, next time may be. Service is sweet and quick, fun ambience, perfect way to say bye to loved ones or gear up for you next travel adventure."}
{"text":"There weren't many choices in this terminal, but Archibald Mircobrasserie appeared to be a pretty solid choice compared to the cold sandwich route. The setup was cozy with high cushiony wooden chairs, mooseheads on the walls, and local beers on the walls. Given that this is an airport, you'd think there would be some sense of urgency with the waitstaff, but no. I waited about 15 minutes to be acknowledged. The good news was that when the waitress arrived, she was friendly and speedy. I got the burger (lettuce, tomato, onions) and house fries. And though overpriced, it was a solid choice."}
{"text":"Comme a Québec!!! Superbe décor, la nourriture tel que hamburgers et pizza est simple mais parfait pour un dîner rapide avant de sauter dans l'avion... Au pire, on y va seulement pour le décor et on est ravi...."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right across from Gates 49-51, so you can easily stop by for a quick lunch or dinner before you board. The pastas are great and they offer a delicious variety of sangrias. We left the restaurant very filled and just in time for our flight. :)"}
{"text":"I was flying to Saint John this afternoon and had a stopover at the Montreal airport.  I had lunch at Archibald Microbrasserie.  I ordered a pound of smoked chicken wings with BBQ whisky sauce and Sweet n' Sour sauce.  The wings were delicious!  They were crispy on the outside and hot and moist on the inside.  There was a hint of smoke.  The sauces were tasty too.  Alex was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.  I'm at the Montreal airport a couple times a year and I didn't know it existed ... apparently it's been there for about two years.  What a great find!  Alas, because I was continuing on to Saint John and renting a car, I had a Diet Pepsi rather than trying one of their beers.  The next time I'm coming home from Montreal, I'll definitely stop in again and have one!"}
{"text":"This is a chain that I already knew from QC city. Stopped here for a quick lunch before a flight. It's a fast food chain. We told them the amount of time we had to eat, and they helped us respect it. The ambience is nice, food is pricey (well airport prices always are) and OK, nothing extraordinary.   It was okay for a quick snack. I prefer the food from the QC city locations."}
{"text":"For airport food this is NICE! The onion soup was spot on and the Beef Cheeks with veggies was just what I needed  (currently being on a restricted diet)! YUM! My server was extra nice too. Not rushed and everything came out on time!"}
{"text":"Hungry for breakfast during my layover in Montreal. Walked around and this place caught my eye. Kind of a Scottish meets Abercrombie & Fitch vibe - plaid and trophy stuffed fish on the walls. I was seated at a 2-seater with push leather chairs in front of an electronic fireplace. The warmth from it on this unusually cool end of summer day was welcome. Yes, they place is a microbrewery concept but just too early to start a work trip with beer.   I ordered the omelettes with mushrooms and a coffee. The food was dynamite. The omelettes had a mild cheese, grilled (what to me looked like emoji) mushrooms, wilted arugula, potatoes, and a mustard-y like sauce. It came with a side of roasted diced potatoes (yes, more potatoes) and a mini bucket of a few pieces of toast with those single serving packages of peanut butter and jellies.   Mind you, this is not what is normally get. In my book, a meal is not a meal if it doesn't have meat! But this was quite good. The omelettes were savory and the arugula and mustard gave it a pleasant spiciness. The potatoes were roasted perfectly with a nice crispy crust. Even the toast (white and multigrain) had a very nice light crunch to it. And most important of all when it comes to breakfast - a never ending pour of piping hot coffee.   The service was very pleasant and attentive. But it wasn't very busy at the time so perhaps this changes during peak times. It was a bit pricy for the food, but probably on par for fancy airport food."}
{"text":"Nous avions du temps à tuer avec mon copain et nous voulions manger un petit repas et prendre une boisson avant notre vol, alors nous avons trouvé que l'Archibald pouvait répondre à nos besoins. Je n'avais pas une grande faim donc j'ai opté pour une entrée de nachos. Moi qui n'avait pas faim j'ai été servi; l'assiette est immense et bien garnie (beaucoup de fromage, tomates, piments forts et échalote) accompagné de salsa, guacamole et crème sure. Cela aurait été bien qu'ils mettent quelques olives noires, mais c'est une question de goût et cela aurait rendu l'assiette plus colorée. Sachez aussi que la crème sure est mise sur le dessus des chips, ce que personnellement je n'aime pas, car je préfère qu'elle soit à part comme je n'en mange que très peu. Toutefois, j'ai bien aimé mon plat. Mon copain quant à lui a pris un burger et une poutine en extra (environ 3 ou 4$). La poutine était très bonne et le burger excellent. Le service était rapide, efficace et super friendly. On aime!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here tonight. We tried two types of tartar, the beef and the tuna special, along with the poutine, all of which were delicious. The Irish Cream Ale was also very good.  Service was great as well, and prices were fair, especially for airport food.   The poutine was great because the gravy was extremely well seasoned. The beef on top and the cheese curds were also very good. The tuna tartare was also surprisingly good. There was a maple aioli on it, which gave it a bit of sweetness, that made it very unique. The beef tartare was also well seasoned, but a bit less beef forward than usual."}
{"text":"During  a 5 hour layover we stopped in for dinner and drinks.  The service was exceptional and food was delicious.  This place makes you forget you're in an airport.  The ambiance was cozy and warm!   We started with the Poutine.  It was different than the American version I've had.  This dish included diced pickles and mustard which gave it a little twist from what I'm use too.  Regardless still delicious!  The prosciutto linguine with mushrooms was exceptional.  My husband enjoyed his shepherds pie as well!"}
{"text":"On m'a informé qu'Archibald a joint le groupe Labatt en 2016, donc le terme \"microbrasserie\" est à employer avec réserve."}
{"text":"Literally the absolute best airport food I've had. The tuna salad was the perfect portion size, just the right amount of dressing and great balance of flavour!  Brownie is more like a ganache tort - creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a long layover in Montreal and found this place on yelp. Might've been a tad hungover from the night before and had no intentions of drinking, but only realizing this place brewed their own beers after being handed the menu, I had to order a flight. Along with it I ordered a french onion soup.  I had the Introduction flight (I think that's what it's called) and it was really good. I think the third or fourth one was my favorite, but I didn't get a chance to see what it was. As for the soup, it was greasy, heavy, and everything I was looking for. Kind of wish I tried something else because I was about to board a flight to France, but the lady seated next to me ordered one and the smell had me thinking about nothing else.  When it came time to pay, I did ask if they took USD because Canada was only supposed to be a layover and I didn't prepare any cash. They said they take it but won't apply a conversion, so $1 USD is the considered the same as $1 CAD. I'd consider coming to this place again, especially if I find myself in Montreal outside of the airport I would definitely check out their other locations."}
