{"text":"While waiting for our flight to leave we stopped here to get a bite to eat. Since it was the only place that looked decent. Combo meals are expensive...$12. Staff members are NOT friendly at all. The guy making our food had a piercing on his lip...it was a huge diamond color stone. When I say huge... I mean HUGE. When they handed me my food I said, \"thanks!\". And got no reply in return.   Seating area was not large enough. We had to wait around for a seat to clear up.   Food was okay. Fries were not good. I was looking for some seasoned salt, but they had none. Overall.... I hope to never have a layover in Phoenix again...."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Phoenix and this place was the only appealing food joint in our concourse. (concoure 4)  The philly cheese steak was good. I have admit it was cheesy, melted in my mouth, and tasted good. I do not like the fries though. The fries felt it was cooked an hour ago and sat under a heat lamp.  They have enough seating for probably 50 people, but i had trouble maneuvering with my bag between the chairs and tables. It's really expensive $12 for a combo. If you're hungry and have a long lay over, go to a different concourse and find food there. Not good."}
{"text":"Lost orders, no ice, soda machine MIA, miscounted change. Pure chaos."}
{"text":"Worst of airport food.  Since the owning company is in Arizona, they obviously need to come out unannounced and do a quality check.  The meat was very gristle ridden and almost flavorless. Salt and pepper are desperately needed.  The onions were totally under done and the meat seemed precooked so it was overcooked when served.  The fries were not completely cooked.  They should strive to be like Charlies in the Atlanta airport and less like an greedy food vendor who doesn't care about quality."}
{"text":"Let's face it... this place is in an airport, so its crazy over priced, and the food is so so. You can't really expect anything more than that"}
{"text":"This had to be the worst chesesteak I have ever had or seen. The meat is such a low grade that I wouldn't have trusted giving it to my pets. The steak was so tough, tasted so bad, and smelled unlike any meat I have smelled before. Located in Sky Harbor in terminal 4, I highly warn you to avoid this place and go to one of the many better choices located in the airport. The counter you order from was dirty, messy, and unappetizing, similar to how the cooking area behind it.   Terrible! No stars!"}
{"text":"not having ever tasted Pat's or Geno's in Philly, this was a pretty weak sandwich."}
{"text":"I have to say that a sandwich from this place just might kill you. But whatever doesn't kill you, will only make you stronger.  They make a decent fast food cheese steak. It's better than anything you'd get at quiznos or subway. Healthier, no. But who going to eat a cheese steak is looking for health?  Their bread is crispy and they make it right infront of you on a long hot table thing, then serve it up. The fries that it can come with are alright. I've had fries 10 times better, but they compliment the grease filled sandwich.  Last time I went, I opted for a healthier option of a baked potato with broccoli. Okay, they put the frozen broccoli pieces in a microwave and heated it up for me, globbed on some cheese sauce stuff, and called it a potato. I'll never opt for their broccoli again, it was just wet and gross. However, the potato is baked well, and if you get the cheese and bacon one, you'll be doing alright.  Stick to the sandwiches. The menu is fairly small. But again, it's pretty much glorified fast food."}
