{"text":"This place just keeps getting better for only being open a few weeks. Yes, I've waited in line because it was worth it. The eggs Benedict are excellent, as well as the French toast.  Large Roasted chic salad homemade blue cheese dressing ( I asked) had fresh potato fries on it. Umm, if I had another hand, I'd have choked myself shoveling all that in! My friend had the ranch on chef...OMG. Soups, My friend and  I had chic tortilla, it was delicious, wonderful aroma,  lil spice kick, I need to get back for more of that. The wedding soup..took home a quart, all I can say. Corned beef on rye all fresh, buttery melt in your mouth beef. Had their sweet potato fries, yummy, crisp homemade chips, yummy, burgers, buns, tuna salad, macaroni salad, absolutely loved it. I've been there about 5 times with family and friends. We've all ordered different things and sat there saying to each other, try this, try this. Waitresses are very friendly and the place is clean. And this whole review leads into the homemade brownie a la mode...need I say more. Give the kitchen a round of well deserved beers! Welcome to the neighborhood Becky :)"}
{"text":"I still say place has the best hamburger around. I  think I  will try something different next time. But once I get there, it's hard to resist the burger. Awesome dessert today. Ice cream and brownie."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for coffee, breakfast, or brunch. It's a pretty sleepy little diner for it's location. Prices aren't bad, and the food isn't either. I typically get sandwiches from here. BLT's are pretty good. I never tried the breakfast options, (I don't like eating breakfast out) I heard they were pretty good. Standard fare stuff, but not bad for a tiny place like this. It's certainly more quiet than the Carriage."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Becky's Place. We've been there several times, and it never disappoints. The pancakes are amazing, and the coffee is fantastic. What more do you really need in the morning? (oh right. bacon. and that's really good, too.)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab some food after we spent a lovely morning exploring Round Hill Farm and Round Hill Playground/Spray Park. The kids were melting down and this was the closest open place. The restaurant is small and very basic. No flourishes except for the croaking frog upon opening the front door. The food was excellent! Staff were helpful especially when I pointed to a charred slider on my son's plate. They took it and replaced it without any fuss. Both the French fries and chips were some of the best we've had in the greater Pittsburgh area. Prices were very reasonable. Great place! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went here today for breakfast and it was just great! I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were gigantic and yummy! My friend had eggs, sausage , and toast and she loved her meal too. The waitress was super nice and the restaurant was very clean! A good pick!!"}
{"text":"Very good service and the food was great.  We had breakfast for the first time and enjoyed very much.  I would recommend this resturant to everyone. The place was very clean and well maintain."}
{"text":"Grew up in Elizabeth and when I walk in to this friendly atmosphere, I feel like I've walked into Cheers. Food is great and the portions match the price. Eaten here many times and will be back."}
{"text":"As they say in baseball, \"Three strikes and you're out.\"   I wanted to like Becky's, but it looks like my search for a breakfast place in my new neighborhood continues...  I have been to Becky's on 3 different occasions.  I applied the new restaurant \"learning curve\" and kept giving it another chance to impress me... it didn't.  From burnt toast, to over-medium eggs being well over-cooked, to pancakes that cannot compete with the Bisquick mix I have at home... Meet me at Becky's?  I'd rather stay in and have cereal.  One every attempt, there have been visible problems with this \"restaurant\" -   1) The owner, Becky, would rather walk around with a pot of coffee in her hand, schmoozing with her friends than refill anyone else's cup OR assist her staff with clearing tables so those who are crammed in the doorway can sit.  She must realize that these are paying customers.  Your friends cannot support your business alone.  2) The chef will be the demise of Becky's Place.  I find it hard to overcook eggs.  I would think this would be essential to working in the breakfast/brunch business.  Every visit - whether over-medium, scrambled, or omelette,, my eggs were dry and unpleasant.  Personally, I feel their \"omelette\" pan is just too small.  By pouring your 3 egg mixture into a pan that is too small, you must cook the eggs longer in order for them to cook through.  This causes the eggs to dry out and occasionally burn (which is obvious from the meals I received).  Also what pancake mix are they using?!  They are grainy and just unpleasant to eat.    3) Service is lacking at Becky's, as well.  There may be 12 tables in the venue.  Usually there are 2 girls working at a time (I won't include the owner because she doesn't help these girls much).  These girls have to take orders, deliver food, take checks, and bus tables. They don't know the menu.  They are inefficient.  I know first hand that waiting tables is a hard job, but these girls just aren't working smart.   I don't like writing bad reviews, but Becky's Place is not the place for me.  I won't be returning to give it \"one more shot\"... Time to find a new breakfast restaurant in my new neighborhood."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Becky's Place for a late breakfast yesterday. I believe this restaurant just opened up about a month ago, so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant is rather small, so seating is limited. We got there just as the lunch rush came pouring in, and it got very busy, very quickly for a Monday morning.   Anyway, I ordered steak & eggs and my friend ordered eggs benedict, both of which were good for a diner-type place. It seemed to me like they used seasoned salt on the home fries, which I'm not a fan of. Nevertheless, everything was cooked as I asked, and the coffee was really good. There were only a few chairs for waiting customers, so when the lunch crush started it got a little crowded in there. The waitresses were very nice and helpful, although we had to wait a little longer for coffee refills because they had to seat two large groups of people just as our meals were coming out. Overall, Becky's Place has good traditional breakfast food in a comfortable setting. I think if I came back on a day that wasn't so busy, then I'd like it even more."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Went in for breakfast and the waitress was so friendly, fast, & efficient, which is something that really matters when you have a toddler with you!! The food was delicious-loved their sausage links! I think we found our new weekend breakfast spot!! Couldn't say a bad word about this place!"}
{"text":"The food was not anything out of the ordinary. By that I mean I could go to the grocery store and buy the same thing and make it myself cheaper and better! The pancakes were dry and had a funny taste!"}
{"text":"Good food, I had some sort of Mexican omelet.. it was a special but they should put it on the menu it was very good.  Only downside is that it is very casual - there are a lot of 'regulars' so you might take a back seat to the chit chat."}
