{"text":"Small little restaurant big jerk flavour  had the rise and peas with bone in chicken.  Moderately spicey with extra hot sauce on the side.  Everything including the coleslaw was great!  I would come again  great for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The owner is genuine and friendly!  The chef (whomever she is) is amazing!!  The restaurant is kept clean and welcoming!  Everyone should try this place!  Their curry chicken and paratha is da bomb!!"}
{"text":"My family's new favourite roti shoppe! I ordered the rice and peas, plantains and curry goat and have plenty left overs for multiple meals (how do they know I LOVE rice and peas?). Boneless curry goat was nicely seasoned with just the right amount of spice for my taste. My husband ordered the buss up shot (flaky paratha not to be confused with regular paratha or sada roti) and boneless curry goat. Rest of the family ordered the doubles, chicken roti, curry goat in daal paratha. Everyone was happy with their selection. Service was friendly and it was clear this is a popular spot for a lunch time crowd. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Rice and Peas was awesome, oxtail was amazing! The Bus up Shot was massive, and was soo good"}
{"text":"Driving from North York to Mississauga for Jerk one time was like ok it's good but driving back for seconds the week after well worth it because the jerk was not only deliciously consistent, the oxtail I ordered was simply in one word summed up...perfectly seasoned and incredibly tasty!!! Will keep coming back no matter the commute!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and already iam hooked . I 've been to other carribean restaurant around the airport area.( where i work ) . So far this one is my lunch time go to place. The staff was very friendly and they accommodated the free double when you check in on yelp . The ox tail i had was just delicious.i know iam coming back for more ."}
{"text":"Great good at a reasonable price. Their jerk chicken is my favorite! Call ahead if you want to avoid the line ups during the lunch rush. Definitely come hungry since their portions are quiet large compared to most other Caribbean spots in the same area."}
{"text":"Love this spot and located so conveniently for my colleagues and I! The staff and owners are super friendly, always greeting us with a smile making the experience more enjoyable.   Favourites are definitely a tie between the Coco Bun with a beef patty (hello delicious carb overload!) and doubles. Let me talk about these doubles for a second. The bara is a perfect mixture of soft and crispy every single time I order it, making each bite more enjoyable than the last. Try filling it with chicken too, it's delicious! Rotis are delicious too, I've tried chicken, goat and shrimp and they're all consistently tasty.   Love visiting here for some Ting or Champagne Cola as well. Now I'm hungry."}
