{"text":"Quality and quantity both are fantastic. It's a good Afghani cuisine. Reasonable price!"}
{"text":"One of the best Afghani food I took in Toronto. The prices are lower than other same restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow.. the food here is amazing.. for 5.99 kafta kabob comes with huge plate of rice, kabob, salad and naan. The decor may need some work but huge bang for your buck for some delicious food. Definitely will bring more friends and family here in the near future"}
{"text":"Ordered two chapli kebab plates for lunch. Full of flavour and very delicious. Reasonably priced and did not take long to come."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Worth the trip out to the northern most reaches of Toronto (and southern most reaches of Markham).   First off, this place would be quite hard to find if my friend had not directed me here (blue buildings) and even sent an accompanying picture of the store front.  The owner was super friendly when we walked in. Not overbearingly, but welcoming.  We ordered our food and he said \"don't worry, just pay me later\".   One thing to note: the picture menu shows the kebab meals with rice and salad but what is not mentioned is that each meal comes with one naan each. You can get an extra one for 99c. These naan are (what I am assuming) Afghan style, which is fluffier and more uniformly thick than its Peshwari or Indian cousin.  We took a seat in the dining room side, which has air conditioning and waited. Everything here seems home style, from the cloths that the naan came wrapped in to the serving trays, even the dining furniture, which made us feel like we were entering the owner's home. Not a bad thing, just caught me by surprise at first.  The food came out quite quickly with two sauces (the brownish one is super spicy and the red one quite sour). I had the tikka kebab and my friend had the chicken kebab. Both were excellent, succulent, juicy and with great marinade. I actually wasn't the biggest fan of the naan, but I chalk that up to personal preference because I saw people filing in for take out orders and buying only giant plastic bags full of naan to take home."}
{"text":"Food overall is pretty yummy ~~  Service is pretty good aswell!!  A few reasons as to why I am  giving 3star instead of 4 is because they might want to work on getting a wider selection for their menu. Also the restaurant looks a little crap..and imo i think it needs some renovation because the walls have holes and marks and left over garbage party decor, plus broken window and just looks really messy overall..   But other than that the food was good, portion was huge and price is cheaper than bamiyan kabob.   Possibly will be back~~"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is a damn good kofta kabob place. And its damn cheap, what more could one ask for.   Ordered all the kabobs on the menu, with a large quantity of them being kofta. The chapli kabob was spicy, as in it seems to have too many dried red chilies ground into the kebab. The tikka kabob and chicken breast was strictly OK.   Having said that, will I be back, hell yeah. But this time I will just stick to a butt load of kofta kabob. Am I willing to make the trek to Sahebi from Toronto, No."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical when I saw their prices. But I went for it anyways since I was hungry. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars...I'm guessing I just had bad luck.  Had the sultani and wazeri. The beef was clearly \"too old\". A sign that it's been unsold for a long time. It had no tenderloin texture. It looked like tenderloin but once you chew it, it's nasty. The 2nd reason for the 1 star is the naan bread. I don't think it's freshly baked. I ordered extra and they were larger, and the bag was cold and it was obviously not freshly baked.   Flavor wise the chicken, kofta, and rice were on point. I love the afghan spice.  After eating it, I understood why their prices are so low. A Sultani (beef tenderloin + ground beef) would normally cost at least $13. This place does it for $9.50. Since I can't trust the meat quality, I absolutely will not come back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Dined in Sahebi Kabob this week, ordered the Kofta Kabob plate for $5.99. Came with two pieces of meat, brown rice, salad, one piece of naan and two types of chutney. Very generous portions!!! Amazing flavour, food was delivered to my table in about twenty minutes. I'm in no hurry when in restaurants, prefer to wait and have my meal cooked fresh to order.  Gave my compliments to the owner and the least I could do is give him a good review for the tasty food. In comparison to Bamiyan Kabob, they are a lot cheaper. Problem is Bamiyan Kabob minutes from my apartment, whereas Sahebi Kabob is in Markham. Having said that, if I'm in the area again, I'll be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"My wife and i have been going to Sahebi Kabob when we are at the Markham and Steeles area and they remain the best place for afghan fare. The place might not look ritzy, but the food has always been great.   The best items are:  -beef tikka kebob -chicken kofta kebob -the spicy red tomato sauce is standard for dipping your naan bread and is amazing  There has yet to be place that can compare to their quality and value. They use sargent farms meats for those inquiring about the source. The only issue is that at times they are understaffed as it is family run casual restaurant."}
{"text":"We went when they opened at 11 on a Sunday... They weren't ready yet. I don't recommend going at this hour as the food took a long time. However, the couple working at the store were very nice and made the food fresh right away! Prices are definitely more reasonable and cheaper than bamiyan. I ordered the Kofta and that tasted pretty good, would definitely recommend it. This was a hole in a wall and definitely authentic!"}
{"text":"Only their Naan was fresh and the rice. Tikka kabob was not fresh. Tasted frozen.  There is no such thing as Fresh Frozen.  When they marinate it and then throw it in the freezer.   I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in as we wanted to look for an alternative to bamiyan kabob and we were so glad that we did.   Food was excellent. Fresh, well seasoned and generous portions with far better prices.  Dining area is very basic; we would likely do takeout next time. Definitely highly recommended for quality Afghan food."}
{"text":"They advertise as Afghan food but really the owners are from Quetta. The food is pretty much representative of the region. Those who are complaining about chewy kababs need a more developed palate. Anyway, my review is based on the following categories:  Prices: fair. More reasonable than competitive Afghan kabob places. ***** (=5 stars)  Service: ***** prompt as can be and food delivered on table for you, food served hot and fresh. They also offer take out.  Authenticity:*****  Taste: ***** I would say the food is flavorful and their kababs are well cooked, rice is silky /smooth(Only way I can describe the texture) , the dipping sauce is great for dipping bread but I also add it to everything else for extra zing. Overall more flavorful than bamiyan and the like. I have ordered a variety of dishes to compare and nothing has disappointed me.   Ambiance***** no-one said this is a five star restaurant with carpets and chandeliers. It is clean , never over crowded, and overall pleasant. Tables are large so you can enjoy your meal with your family. Satisfactory. Plenty of parking available too."}
{"text":"Okay, much like all great champs, Ali, Tyson and hopefully Mayweather, a new champion is crowned and for Afghani Kabobs my new champion is Sahebi Kabob!  Wanted to try something new from my regular Bamiyan but didn't want to fight the crowd associated with the dinner rush so checked out Yelp and found this place.  Located in possibly the ugliest group of plazas in the city stands a hidden gem for Afghani food.  Came in around 6pm and the place was empty...uh oh....did Yelp lead me astray??  Ordered a variety of wraps and combos for take out and the lone gentleman said it will take about 15 mins.  Left and came back to pick up the goodies for Sunday dinner.  Oh boy did we enjoy that Sunday dinner!  The kofta, chicken breast and chaplee kabobs were probably the best I've had. All were so tender, perfectly done with a spicy kick.  The wraps were excellent, flavourful and moist.  The Afghani bread is more like Indian Naan then the drier version at Bamiyan.  The only weak point would have been the tikka (beef tenderloin) as Bamiyan does a better job there.  Value wise the price was excellent and cheaper with larger portions then Bamiyan.  Cheaper and bigger portions???  How can you go wrong!!!  As a bonus the hot sauce that comes with it is fantastic with a variety of spices.  Kinda like that Frank's Hot Sauce commercial, \"I put that sh*t on everything!\"   The place has seating on the side but is more of a take out place then anything.   Fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee, Sahebi is now the kabob place for me!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Exceptional quality of meat, well prepared and a good variety of product.  The naan bread was also fresh and went exceptionally well with the meat.  Excellent marinades on the different meat products.  Spouse and I decided that the food in this Afghani restaurant was the best Afghani food we have ever had in Toronto.  A really good experience and also very good value for the quality of meats.  Five stars for this wonderful establishment!"}
{"text":"Hidden GEM!!  One of the greatest cheap eats of GTA My only beef here why arent they open past 10  This is my go to joint when im on a low carb binge. They make awesome skewers on charcoal. The chapli frankly ive had better but other meats are worth the skewers their skewed on"}
{"text":"You'll have to look really hard to spot the place.   Tucked and hidden in a plaza full of colourful buildings and bright lights, it's easy to pass right by this hidden little gem without noticing at night.  It's not a romantic candle light dinner you expect to bring a date but if you're looking for good and cheap eats but tired of fast food, then look no further.   As all the previous yelpers mentioned, price is quite reasonable and the quality is spectacular. Under 10$ for a full meal with bread, lettuce and cucumber salad , long grain rice,along with the protein of your choice- chicken breast, tikka (beef), kofta (their kofta is made of ground chicken , not pork),and sultani(tikka+kofta) , or their special for 13.99 for the meat heads who wants all of the above!   It's hand down compare able , if not exceeds their mainstream competitor down the street who charges 15$ for the same meal !!"}
{"text":"TIP: The sauce is for dipping the naan bread in.  Some patience is required, as my order took 15 to 30 minutes to prepare.  When I was finished, I had considered a take out order, but did not want to wait another 15 to 30 minutes for it.  However, if you are not in a hurry, the servings are very generous as is the pricing.  Naan bread sauce added a unique flavour to an otherwise simple bread.  The halal meat kabobes were outstanding, with the seasoning and grill time being done to perfection.  Decor is more or less in line with fast food restaurants."}
