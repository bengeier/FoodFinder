{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourites in the area. Delicious food, good service, and cheap! They even deliver!"}
{"text":"Je vais dans ce restaurant régulièrement. C'est clairement le meilleur restaurant indien du coin. La bouffe est vraiment bonne, c'est pas cher et c'est définitivement moins bondé que les autres restaurant plus populaires qui sont dans le coin.

Les samosas sont vraiment très bons. Les soirs de semaine je passe parfois me chercher un thali vegetarien. Pour 7$ j ai une salade, du prix, un pain naan et trois portions au choix du chef, qui sont toujours bon et varié. J'ai essaye plusieurs autres plats et sérieusement, tout est bon! Le poulet au yogourt est juste malade. La lassi (boisson a boire au yogourt et aux épices) et le palak paneer sont délicieux aussi.

Les prix sont peu élevés. L'autre jour j'y suis allée avec ma famille. On a commande tout ce qui nous faisait envie, des entrées, des plats de légumes et des plats de viande. Ça nous est revenu a 65$ pour 4 personne et on a ramené plein de restants.

Le service est rapide et amical, mais parfois un peu maladroit. Comme dans la plupart des restos indien, il ne faut pas s'attendre a se faire servir en français, donc  a bonne entendeuse, salut!

Bref, resto a découvrir!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Indian food but wanted something on the more affordable end, so we found this spot. Located on a stretch of Parc-Ex that's filled to the brim with Indian or Pakistani restaurants, we figured it had to be good, right? 

It was a Saturday night and the place was packed, but luckily we were able to get one of the last tables left. The decor isn't a whole lot to brag about, but we weren't bothered too much. It was particularly loud this night, and they seemed to be understaffed on the floor. After waiting for about 15 maybe 20 minutes, I flagged down one of the servers to take our order. 

We had the Thali for dinner (curry lamb and butter chicken, respectively) along with some chai. Long story short, the food was amazing. The lamb was tender and juicy. The chicken, creamy and sweet. Both had just the right amount of kick, excellent use of spices. The naan was the \"fresh out the tandoor\" kind. Plus the chai was tasty as well. 

Of course, after we were done, we had to jump, holler, and do backflips for a server to get us our bill. I think they were probably swamped. 

Four stars for the food and value, two stars for the service, a solid 3. Maybe we'll just get take-out next time."}
{"text":"If you open an Indian resto on this stretch,  you have to be on your top game. 

This byob is a good option if the others nearby are packed. Please specify if you like spicy,  since the default seems to be mild.

I tried some of my normal faves here. 

Chicken Tikka Massala, creamy and mild.
With nice juicy chunks of meat and a tangy tomato aftertaste. 

Chicken and fish pakora. 
Different breading for each and a bargain at $5 for about 8 pieces.  They were fried to order but not as spicy.

I also had some Naan,  which was a bit undercooked and some samosa that were amazing. 

They grind the potatoes to an almost creamy state, followed by a tasty tamarind sauce. 

The location is one that's gone through different changes,  hopefully this one will 

The decor and service were both pretty nice."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. We got there in the afternoon, and only 3 other customers were there. We came for the buffet and there was barely any food left. I had to scrape off the bottom of the pan for rice. They refilled very slowly and never refilled the popular dishes like butter chicken. The waitress never came to pick up our dishes or to ask if everything was alright. There was also no variety of food (maybe because most trays barely had anything in them)...and most dishes were just sauce,no substance (like meat,veggies). I guess you really cannot expect too much with a  11$  meal."}
{"text":"Although the neighbourhood is teeming with Indian restaurants, Flavours of India remains my go-to. It used to be called Moti Mehal, and took its present name after changing hands a few years ago. It was recommended to me by Indian friends, who described the food as very good and authentic.

It's a small neighbourhood restaurant, so don't expect the decor or plating to be a wow-factor - to their credit, they did renovate about a year ago, good for them!
What really matters is the food, which is fresh, delicious AND cheap!  
We tried the vegetable pakora, butter chicken, chicken korma, baingen bhartha (vegetarian eggplant dish), garlic naan, and paneer naan. The chicken dishes could have used more meat and less sauce, but everything was delicious flavour-wise. Due to the delivery service they offer, the hardworking staff can be overwhelmed at busy hours, so waiting times varied in between courses. 

A great casual restaurant if you're obsessed with naan fresh-out-of-the-tandoori, like me."}
{"text":"I've decided to sample a different indian place than my usual one, just to be open-minded and give everyone a chance :-p
The place is nice though very basic but nothing surprising here as it's pretty much how all the indian restaurants are around here.
The menu gives you all the usuals and we went for the thalis, vegetarian and lamb cari. They're cheap and will fill you up just enough until next time.
They were quite good though lacking diversity for me as all the dishes seemed to have the same sauce on both our thalis.
Staff was friendly though nothing beyond normal politeness.
All in all a good option if you're in the area wanting a quick and not too expensive indian fix."}
{"text":"To be honest, after trying so many restaurants in Montreal for Indian food, I think I found the best in terms of price, quality of food and friendliness of the staff. So, I arrived around 5 pm, they have this huge board before you get in the restaurant of their buffet at $7.95 Monday to Friday which is an amazing price for buffet especially for Indian food! It's too good to be true. 

Then, once I got in I was welcomed by a huge smile from the hostess who seemed so nice and sweet. She told me I could take a table anywhere. I chose my spot and she brought me water and my glass as well as the menu. She was serving other clients in the mean time and i was browsing the menu. Going through the menu made me realized of how affordable is the food here and how is it possible that I have never been here before. I finally made my choice and ordered bel puri for starters, it consists of puri, tamarind sauce, yogurt and spices, my food arrived in 10 minutes and at first bite of the bel puri, I was in love with this place and the food. I am such person who loves to see the love in the food and not just a restaurant placing orders here and there. The host brought it to me and I crushed it!! Omg it was so delicious and spicy. Again I'd say it's the best!!

Then, my main course arrived, I ordered chilli paneer and butter naan, to my surprise I was fascinated by how the naan is so soft and delicious as well as consistent right from the tandoor. So fresh and the chilli paneer is to die for!!! I totally fell in love with this place and it's food!! This is my new favourite Indian spot fix from now!!! I've been to so many popular restaurant but this one is special and real north Punjabi cuisine which I totally wanted today and they made it spicy as I asked for more spice. Love this one. 

I'd definitely return to try their other foods on the menu as to my eyes, they stole my heart to my stomach for Indian food at its BEST!!! 

Everything was perfect :)"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times (because it's right next to Dee's) and it's amazing. Also, to avoid line-ups from the more popular Bombay Mahal or Punjab Palace nearby, this location is better. AND it's BYOB! Order anything, you can't go wrong. 

The mixed appetizer platter, chana samosa and fish pakoras as very yummy appetizers. As entrees, the chicken tikka sizzler, mango chicken curry and butter chicken thali are great - not to mention their regular, garlic and onion naan. YUM, everything was on point and would go again. Affordable and delicious. My only comment: their butter chicken is a little too sweet."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dans ce restaurant un lundi soir, tout juste après une grosse vigile de plusieurs centaines de personnes qui a bondé tous les restaurants du quartier. En quelques minutes, à leur grande surprise, des dizaines de personnes affamées sont arrivés dans leur resto. Tout un défi lorsqu'un lundi soir (journée habituellement super tranquille) ton resto passe de complètement vide à archi plein avec une file d'attente en quelques minutes. J'avais de sérieux doutes sur s'ils allaient avoir assez de nourriture pour tout le monde !

Mais, le cuisinier a attaqué le défi de front, il a téléphoné à sa famille et ses amis et en une quinzaines de minutes le resto s'est mis à rouler à plein régime. 

La bouffe était incroyable ! Belle variété de plats, les pakora super croustillants, tout était bien assaisonné, et franchement délicieux !

Assez, qu'on a dû y retourner à peine une semaine après parce qu'on avait encore un craving de leur mutter paneer! On a donc essayé leur buffet du midi, et encore une fois, c'était délicieux ! 

À essayer définitivement !"}
{"text":"After having a disappointed lunch at another Indian restaurant down the street,  we decided to go in to flavor of Indian to peek at their buffet. I was very impressed by how fresh and abundant the food looked. For a buffet, it really looked excellent and the price was right $8.95. The lady was very nice to explain every dish to us. I will definitely try them nice time."}
{"text":"It was a typical cold Montréal day when my friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant. My first impressions of the restaurant was that it was cozy. The combination of affordable and delicious food make this place a perfect choice if you're in the mood for Indian. Super budget friendly food that doesn't forsake quality for value. If you're in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place in Montreal. Their naan / kukcha are always crispy, the portions are generous and they offer a nice variety of dishes beyond the usual standards (Chicken 65, idli, vada). I'm addicted to their aloo tikki and onion kulcha."}
{"text":"It's a cool place where you can get so many different delicious flavours of India without breaking the bank. It's a cool place to check out if you love Indian food. It's not fancy, in fact it's very casual but perfect for cheap dinners out in a good company. I'd visit them again next time I'm in a mood for onion bhaji."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT. Bring your own wine, cheap prices and good food. What more can you ask for :) I had the butter chicken thali which was delicious and only 7.99 for dinner. WOW. My boyfriend has the lamb vindaloo and mentioned that it was just the right amount of spicy. The servers we're friendly and we left paying only $25 with tips! For dinner, this is really good pricing and you eat well. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Saag paneer, chicken with ginger, and naan were all fantastic. Perfectly spiced and naan was fresh and crisp. Service was somewhat cold and brusque, especially since the staff seemed to be friendly to those at other tables, and I am very polite and patient. I would give it another try, based on the food. NB this is a BYO place."}
{"text":"Good taste, cheap, fast , thalis, dessert, naan , lassi , etc etc , many tables , less busy than the others restaurants around because new."}
