{"text":"One word \"Roaches\". I was in the mood for Chinese and this was right around the corner from where I was. They didn't seem busy at all. I ordered my food and waited for it only to she a cockroach or waterbug what crawling across the floor and it was huge. It turned me off right away when I told the woman who took my order she didn't look surprised and smashed it with her shoes. From that point on it was time to go."}
{"text":"Good enough Chinese food. You have to ask for fresh wings on the weekend and wait. But it's worth it. They have the best dumplings and shrimp spring rolls in east Charlotte."}
{"text":"AHH I LOVED THEIR SERVICEEE . they gave me a free lil calender with my order it was fast delivery . free eggrolls . the delivery guy was very kind . over all great service and delicious food ."}
{"text":"I Have no issues with this place , the food is great , the people are nice and the delivery is fast and courteous. I order food from twice a month or more for 6 months and no complaints, The portions are satisfying and tasty as well as hot when they arrive. You must try the Chinese doughnuts , ooooh! Fantastic balls of goodness that melt in your mouth.  \"Stay Awesome Gotham!\"  Anna Akana's slogan on YouTube."}
{"text":"I didnt receive the food I ordered, it was somebody else's order, and the food I did get was cold when it arrived.  The sushi was not fresh and I didnt finish it because it didnt really taste or look very good.  Almist as if it had been sitting in the car a little longer than it should.   I did call the place and left a message for someone to call me back because they had closed by then.  Won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"I used to order from this takeout place quite often.  The dumplings were huge, however, the quality of the food has gone down considerably.  If it was bland, I'd shrug it off and find another place, but the last time I ordered it, the food was inedible. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Chinese I have ever  eaten. Or not eaten, as it were. Save your money and choose someplace else."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm very picky when it comes to things like Chinese and tend to stick to what I know when I find that one place I'm satisfied with...and this is it! I can't say nothing bad about this location...from the staff to the food...all is good! God forbid I move to the other side of town, I'll just take that drive to come over here!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal from them. I will be a permanent customer! Food was delivered hot and sooner then expected!  Believe me- great food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. If I'd known they weren't going to cook it I would just have gone to the grocery store. Ordered lunch, they said 10 minutes it took them 4, meat was NOT cooked. Had to toss it. Will never go there again. Only giving one star because zero is not an option."}
{"text":"Ok food and portions. The veggies seemed fresh by the meat was low quality. My egg roll was soft and not very good at all. The sauce was just blah. I probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Chinese food in my area. Always fast, hot and delicious. I absolutely love everything I've ever gotten but my favorite is the crispy scallion chicken made with extra hot chilis."}
{"text":"Never have I ever had any kind of food experience as horrible as this one. They are located less than 1/2 a mile from my residence, and we still had to wait almost 2 hours for food. The chicken was inedible with no flavor, oily beyond all recognition, and covered in an overly sweet syrup that made me gag. My boyfriends pork was no better, the egg rolls were horrendous, and all in all it was a total waste of time and money. Save your money and stay far far away from this place."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place for quick Chinese food delivery!  Their steamed dumplings are huge!! (And very yummy!). The staff members are always very nice and courteous.  Not a single thing wrong I can say!! Thank you for the amazing food and service :)"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Soaked in oil! Seasame chicken were hard dry strips of chicken.  Ibdont want to seem over the top, but this food made me angry!  The eggrolls tasted like burnt motor oil. The sauce was runny oil.   Just really bad.   HOWEVER  the white rice was sticky and very good.  But we threw the rest away."}
{"text":"See the picture I posted. It's like they tried to kill the food. Deep-fried, and then there is \"I left it in the deep fryer for 20 minutes too long\". I guess this would be good food if you're completely drunk. At least it's cheap delivery, hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Just order eggs roll. Shrimp fried rice chicken wings.And it was so so good cooked really golden brown. And all was fresh. Thank you so much COTTAGE EXPRESS 5 STAR'S"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! Prices are extremely reasonable. Overall a great place to eat. The pork egg foo young is just crazy good."}
{"text":"After I ordered my food and have them my credit card information I waited over an hour. I decided to call to see what's up. \"We sent your order to another store.\" They said. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Because you're 6 miles away and we only go 5 miles.\" (I think he said). Then what the f**k did you take my order? The food was sub par when it finally did arrive. UNPROFESSIONAL and cold. Just nasty. I was excited about the fried crab sticks because I'm from NY and we eat those a lot back home. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"A Physiological Review. The moment this poisonous material touched my tongue, it sent high frequency disgust signals to my brain.  My autonomic nervous system took over, igniting a gag reflex so strong I almost exhaled my entire abdominal cavity. Despite it's best efforts, my body allowed a small fraction of glazed chicken down my digestive tract.  I could feel my stomach producing more acid with the hopes of destroying this foreign invader.  My immune system even started producing antigens against Cottage food.  Eventually I did digest this monstrosity and, after hours of intense stomach pain, I finally excreted it with the help of 2 full bottles of Miralax."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Chinese I've ever ordered in my life.  No fortune cookies.  Bad food.  I ordered an iced mocha to try it and it tasted like watery coffee ice cream.  It was cheaper than most Chinese places, but it was by far no where near close to worth the money.  We ordered inside and took it to-go because the place smelled funny and the cashier had her two very young children with her."}
{"text":"Look I'm just happy I finally found a Chinese takeout near me that's good. You really have no clue how hard we've been looking for a descent Chinese take out after we moved to East/University Charlotte.  I love the shrimp egg rolls, the ribs, the wings, and the fried rice. It's so good. I look forward working from home so I can order them for lunch. I'm happy they are close by and you can order online and pay online."}
{"text":"excellent service by far the best place I have had in a while i will most certainly be coming back !"}
{"text":"Never used the Yelp Eat 24 app and now wondering why I haven't used it sooner. I placed my order and followed it. It was here before expected. The gentleman that delivered was very nice. But when I open my container the wrong thing was sent. I simply called spoke with the young lady explain the problem and she quickly sent me the correct item I ordered with no hesitation. 10mins later the gentleman was back to drop off the correct item. The food was delish!!! I will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have had in Charlotte. I try to hold my one star reviews for special occasions and this is one. To start the food was 35 minutes late on the promised delivery time. by the time it reached me, everything was overcooked and cold( and congealed with too much sauce) . My girlfriend ordered hunan chicken over noodles and the chicken felt like it came out of a can. I ordered the tangerine flank steak, and upon cutting open my breaded \"nuggets' all that was there was breading. I literally got no steak. This order was placed through GrubHub, which was my first time using after several positive experiences with DoorDash, and GrubHub severely let down. Overall terrible experience. Had to ask for a refund, upon I was asked to return the food. I returned all of the inedible food which ruined my dinner and they refused to refund the full price. I took about 3 bites of my two plates ordered and it was disgusting. I'm surprised I wasn't sick this morning. They still have not refunded my full cost even though I returned all the food. They deserve a negative star if possible.   DO NOT EAT"}
{"text":"Yelp 24 delivery was great when ordering but worst Chinese food I've ever had. I requested brown rice and chili oil on the side, got white rice and no chili oil. Never again. Food smelled funny too."}
{"text":"I ordered fried chicken (6) and chicken fried rice from Special deals section of the menu, yet the cashier Assumed I wanted the \"lunch special\" which was .45 cents more for 4 wings with  chicken fried and egg roll. That is not a special! The food is good, yet if you carry out check your meal before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Cottage Express is good food the delivery guys are nice. A few  years ago I quit getting food from them because it was lousy but they have greatly improved."}
{"text":"I order 1 hour and 20 minutes ago and still haven't received my food. I called the restaurant they kept saying it's on the way. Now i know you have other people to deliver to but come on 1 hour and 20 minutes and still no food! That means the food will be cold when i get it no thanks don't want it."}
{"text":"Nasty, nasty, nasty!!! Food was not edible. The oil was obviously old and used to overcook our food to a burned crisp. Yet, they sent it out to us anyway when it was dark brown and so hard that you'd break a tooth if you tried eating it. Then, upon our complaining, they proceeded to give us an excuse that \"they turned the burner up so that's why it was overcooked.\" Well then, why didn't you recook it before sending it out to your paying customers? Insulting. The dumplings were undercooked and tasted weird so we were actually afraid to eat those. Especially knowing what the place looks and smells like on the inside. I won't be ordering from here ever again. You would think they would try to keep their customers happy since there is a Chinese delivery place literally on every corner."}
{"text":"We had an appointment at the passport office at lunch time and chose to pop in for food. The service was extremely fast, food was hot and fresh, giant portions (we split beef and broccoli and an order of steamed dumplings) it came with a giant egg roll and huge pile of fried rice. With two drinks we paid under $15 Definitely a place to go to feed your family or a big group for a great price."}
{"text":"The delivery was fast. The food was decent: egg roll was crunchy & not greasy so that was nice. The Singapore mei fun was spicy enough. The wonton soup had 6 wontons so that was nice but it wasn't very flavorful. The fried wontons were not tasty at all & were a bit oily. I will probably order from here again to see how their other dishes are."}
{"text":"Cottage Express is almost completely unremarkable, as they are one of many fast-food Chinese restaurants in strip malls in a city that has dozens, if not hundreds of them.  They do stand out in a few respects, and unfortunately food is not one of them.  At least not in a good way.  The first thing that I noticed is that their banner proclaims that this is the fifth location for this enterprise in the Charlotte area.  Yet strangely I have never noticed another, not even as I attempted to find one online while I was creating this review (note: I did eventually find one place up near El Taco Veloz with a similar name).  Perhaps a marketing tactic, or maybe they are just using another name for this new store.  Whatever the case, it is still odd that not a single other location turns up.  Anywhere.  Next up is the staff.  Generally these small, dimly-lit quick-serve locations are staffed by individuals who do not speak particularly good English, yet are generally regarded as being at best one generation removed from (whatever country they have decided to represent via their food).  Not here.  This staff is instead a couple of teenage girls who are not only definitely American, they let you know at every turn they are interested in only your money, and the food is well down their list of priorities.  Finally, instead of being served something that comes up rather quickly by a quick turn in one massive wok, you get to choose from a steam table.  Not quite a buffet, because you do not get to go back for seconds - and the food on the table does not appear to have been refreshed any time in the last few hours, or perhaps days."}
{"text":"I waited for 2 hours for delivery and live less than a mile away.   Everything was a weird combination of soggy yet burnt.  The smell was so odd I can't pinpoint what it was.   2 hours and $32 later and we couldn't even eat it past the first bite."}
{"text":"Cottage Express is quick, delicious, and has large portions. Best take out Chinese in Hickory Grove!"}
{"text":"Not good. All the food is quite oily and tastes fake. The place is very dark and not very sanitary. We had a stomach ache after eating here."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Disgusting. This is really bad Chinese and it seems unsanitary from the time you walk through the door."}
{"text":"I just got this order less than an hour ago. My general tso's chicken is so soggy that it's absolutely inedible. There is so much sauce that it's spilling over the lip of the box, into the bag, and all over the box. The delivery driver was nice so I feel bad for leaving this review, but it doesn't make up for the fact that I can't eat it."}
