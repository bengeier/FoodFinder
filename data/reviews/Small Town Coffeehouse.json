{"text":"Great coffee! Delicious iced coffee!! Wonderful customer service!! A hidden gem for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, super knowledgeable about their coffee selection. Big tables that are great for studying. Ambiance is calming and lighting is great. Bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Great little hidden place in an office/retail complex. The coffee and service were great, the place was clean and well-decorated, and music was quietly playing in the background (as opposed to blaring as it does in one chain coffee place). The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because the menu mentioned breakfast, but it was prepackaged food in a cold case that they offered to heat."}
{"text":"Nice place. The sunrise burrito is yummy. My husband was looking for something gluten-free and the only option was oatmeal- not his usual choice. I like the cozy fireplace in the corner.  Hubby says the coffee is pleasantly rich. :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this little coffee house so much that we went there every morning while vacationing Phoenix for a week. The coffee and tea are fantastic. The food menu is limited so don't go there hungry."}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this place.

Great tasting smoothies, great coffee crunch muffin & excellent lemon blueberry cookie.

Nice and clean and great customer service.

Wish we had one of these in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Instead of always going to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great place! Cute atmosphere, employees are kind and helpful! Delicious drinks! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned coffee shop across from Midwestern University! I stop here a couple times a week before class - the staff is always incredibly friendly and service is quick. The coffee beats what you'll get at Starbucks or Coffee Bean in quality if not price."}
{"text":"The coffee is fine, but the CHE (coffeehouse experience) is just not there.  If you are looking for great coffee, this place *is* better than Starbucks.  For example, Small Town Coffeehouse knows what a caf√© au lait is -- Starbucks does not, so I have to say \"coffee with steamed milk please\" which ruins the mystique.  ;-)
 
However, if you are looking for a coffeehouse experience, a friendly hangout, then you'd be better off elsewhere, even \"going corporate\" at Starbucks (at least compared to this storefront across from Zipps on 59th Avenue.)  

The signs outside the door about restrooms are for customers only and no outside food or beverages say it all:  They just don't get it.  If you offer a comfortable place that people can come to, all the time, to hang out or read a book or talk to friends, then those people will buy coffee when they want coffee, and they will bring friends too, adding to the customer-base.  They will have business meetings on the sofa, bringing in more potential customers as well.  If they are pushed away however when they just want to hang out, take a phone call, or surf the web on their laptop, then they will go somewhere comfortable.  Starbucks at least \"gets it\" -- I just wish that I liked their coffee!  

My \"talk to friends\" statement is pun-intended FYI.  Remember the *show* Friends?  They hung out at a coffee shop, but only a couple of them were drinking coffee at any given time.  No soup Nazi at that coffee shop for sure, that's another show!  :-D"}
{"text":"Best coffee and donuts in town and the staff is very friendly. I am recommending this business to my friends and co workers."}
{"text":"Starbucks who?? This coffee shop has it all. Great staff, great prices and tasty coffee.  I've heard their muffins are awesome too but haven't tried them for myself... yet. 100% recommend. I love supporting smaller businesses, especially ones that are as awesome as this."}
{"text":"This little coffee house is one of my new favorite spots to grab a cup o' joe.  The staff is all nice and very creative with new drinks.  Their prices cannot be beaten and the coffee is delicious. They offer discounts to the students at Midwestern and local tenants in the surrounding buildings.  They also offer a variety of yummy breakfast items and healthy food for lunch."}
{"text":"I actually never have had coffee in my life but we go here every other Sunday after my kids gymboree class to get a chocolate muffin. The girls that run the place are so sweet to my son and know what he wants as soon as we walk in. Fantastic customer service and great treats! My wife loves the coffee too."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had!!!! The staff was amazingly friendly and overall just such a cool little shop with a great environment! Perfect place for Midwestern students to come relax and study or grab some coffee on their way to class!"}
{"text":"Soooo much better than Starbucks. The chai latte was delicious and smooth and creamy spend your money here lol"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop on the west side! Under new ownership and the difference is clear. Local organic coffee that is top notch is enough for the 5 stars. Throw in great bagels and snacks to supplement is key for any quality coffee shop. The cherry on top is the friendly enjoyable staff who are a joy to be around. There is a nice atmosphere and feel to the entire place great to study, have a small business meeting, or set up time to chat and catch up with someone."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with 3 stars... let me explain myself.  I am an avid coffee drinker and I was very hopeful about small town coffeehouse... my coffee, as well as my friends coffee, did not taste good at all.  I forced myself to finish my coffee only because I paid for it.   The coffee was very bitter and the syrup did not help with the taste at all.  The only reason I give 3 stars is because of the atmosphere.  I'll probably come back again if I need a quiet place to study, but I won't be buying coffee here anymore."}
{"text":"Tried coffee and a brownie. I may have picky taste but coffee wasn't good, watered down and burnt flavor. :( Brownie wasn't fresh. Great selection of snacks though! Ambiance was nice. Quiet and cozy."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly! Coffee is good, the wifi is great. Overall, great place to grab some coffee and study or chat."}
{"text":"Fun little coffee shop!! Later hours would better for students who want to study later in the day."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much because I love quaint, mom and pop stores.  I swung in here because I had business in the same plaza and wanted and needed a coffee.  I was one of only two people in there but it still managed to take the girl 25 minutes to get me my latte!  I was told she would be right with me but I never got any warmth from her as though she were happy to have me as a patron. I had nothing special just something off their menu as well did the gal in front of me, I was very thankful I had the time before my appt.  This was my first time in so I figured I would give it another shot and I did the very nest day...unfortunately it was the same experience however I still lovede the shop so much I told my wife of it and she wanted to check it out and I found myself in there again the very next day!  Now this was a Saturday morning and it was a bit busier filled with bicyclists and I was fearful I may not get my wife to work on time.  She was left with the same impression I had and she is very open minded and can formulate her own opinions so I feel she was not swayed by my opinions.  She did point out she thought they were pricey even more so than another more well renowned coffee shop.  I was really hoping out of three swings they may at least get a base hit but they went down looking...."}
{"text":"Just what Glendale needs! I love locally owned places. Took my granddaughter here the other day. They treated her so special.  She ordered the hot chocolate, with whipped cream (of course ).  The coffee was delicious. Tried the sunrise burrito, it was very good.  I was glad it wasn't oversized. There seemed to be lots of regulars, the staff knew them by name and drink order.  Anxious to go back."}
{"text":"We love our new go to coffee place. Yes, with all the new coffee houses popping up on just about every corner in Phoenix, we now have a choice. I choose Small Town Coffeehouse. These guys are in it to win it. You can almost see the wheels turning in their heads as they talk of their passion. They are not baristas, they are Mixologists that know what combinations it takes to make your favorite drink. Small Town Coffee 4 LIFE ! Below you will see how our day started. A Chocolate Chip Chiller with an extra shot on top, and a Double Dirty White Russian Chai."}
{"text":"As I walked in the person behind the counter was very welcoming, which gave it small town feeling.  They are attentive and quick!  I had a great experience all the way around!  Give it a try and see what you think.  I will definitely be back.  The Russian Chai and Vanilla Latte are really good in my opinion."}
{"text":"WOW!! My first time here and it definitely won't be my last. My coffee was absolutely delicious! French vanilla, mocha and coconut. Very cute coffee shop under new ownership and you can tell they truly care about excellent service and quality. Super friendly staff! This is definitely my go to coffee shop now! You need to stop in and try one of so many amazing flavors they offer- you will love it!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Best coffee shop I've been to in the Glendale area. The whole indoor area is very cute and cozy. I've only been once and got a sweet speciality coffee, next time I'd get a cappuccino to really taste some coffee"}
{"text":"There's something so nice about a little family owned small coffee shop and I'm so happy this little gem in across the street from my daughters medical school.  The coffee is always delicious and  the chai tea is spot in.  Skip the big chain coffee shops and come here."}
{"text":"Parking is bad. There was one space in front of their place (that wasn't handicapped or for more than 15 minutes) and it was taken. I was hungry so i ordered a burrito, thinking in my head they were fresh. They served me a microwaved, rubbery, scalding hot burrito, made with an 8\" tortilla. And I paid $4.50 for it!!! Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, coffee is delicious, staff is laid back and very friendly. Easy to study! Perfect location and distance from my school."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good service, cute shop. Great place to meet for coffee or do homework! Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I've come here twice now and this place is wonderful! Great atmosphere inside and out for just grabbing a cup of coffee and relaxing or sitting down and doing some writing on the computer. A bit cold inside but a nice escape from the heat outdoors! Awesome coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Ever since the new owners took over, the place has really gone downhill.  They fired all the old baristas, and now the coffee sucks.  This is really unfortunate as now I have to drive to starbucks in between classes instead of just walking across the street."}
{"text":"First time at Small Town and got to see great drama and have some great coffee. The drama was a woman coming into the store demanding to speak to the owner who calmly identified himself. The woman then went off on him shouting vulgarities and threatening to kick his butt. He asked her to stop yelling in his shop and to step outside with him. After hearing here verbally attack him at the top of her lungs attempting to belittle him - it turns out her daughter was parked in one of the coffee house parking spots for over two hours and I guess he told her she was close to being towed which is what sparked this crazy outburst.  In a fun twist, the daughter flipped off the owner when she sped away which the mother claimed she taught her daughter to do, lol. Definitely a poor example of parenting. Hopefully it doesn't detract from what an awesome place the shop and coffee is and of the friendly people that work there. Bottom line, I was impressed with the owner and how he handled it - very professional. Funny how he got yelled at for a girl doing something wrong. Anyway I will be back!"}
{"text":"There is a special menu full of drinks that taste like candy. The baristas are super nice. The coffee is smooth and well made too. There's nothing to dislike here. The space is a little on the small side, but I find that cozy."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and all coffees I've tried have been good, except they don't necessarily taste like the flavor I chose. Still good though! A bit overpriced but still worth the visit while in the area"}
{"text":"Great new coffee house! Good coffee, friendly staff, and a good study spot for students."}
{"text":"Quiet little coffeehouse tucked away in a large shopping area. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. The 3 times I have been in, it was quiet and barely anyone in there which made it great for getting work done and making calls. However I overheard the owner said that was because it was summer. Once school starts (Midwestern just across the street), things pick up. 
I really like that they put TWO shots of espresso in their small lattes!  and their donuts are a treat. I can't seem to resist the blueberry cake donut every time I go in. I've yet to try the red velvet! 
Beware: parking is constantly a nightmare in the shopping complex due to the Zipps Sports Grill next door and possibly students parking in the lot. You may have to take a hike from where you park."}
{"text":"I found it... Fellow westsiders... I found the local coffee shop with the best tasting coffee!! And they have recently been adding fun new things to their menu. Including a√ßa√≠ bowls and shakes, Italian sodas, and avocado toast! Follow them on social media and you can find out when they will be having local artists come and sign, play guitar, and piano in their shop. Usually on Friday and Saturday nights. I recently had the Nutty Hawaiian I believe it was coconut and and caramel and it was not overly sweet, you were able to taste the coffee, and it was creamy smooth. You will find lots of snacks, sweet treats, and healthy snacks available as well. Everything is decently priced and this shop is super cute, decently sized, lots of sitting space, and cute decor. Come here to hang, study, or come in to grab and go. I'm so glad I finally found a local coffee shop that actually has coffee taste to their coffee drinks!"}
{"text":"great spot to work or read. cold brew is really good, service is friendly and they have s ton of options! temp is perfect (lots of places tend to freeze you out!) !) and there are plenty of outlets if you're working. one of my favs in the west valley"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to give this place one more try!  Guess what???  We loved it!  My drink was perfect and very tasty!!!  My daughter loved hers too!  Will definitely be back!!!  Great barista!!  She rocked it!!"}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop near Midwestern University. Definitely has a warm and friendly feel when you walk in. Their coffees and teas are great with a small selection of food items for purchase as well. It seems to be a great spot for college students and small group meetings."}
{"text":"My wife and I have a great time talking with the staff. Very friendly and open for convo. The coffee is great too. The owners are super cool too"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, offered suggestions/alternatives, and coffee was made quickly. Coffee was good! Had a dirty chai latte, cousin had americano. Interior is clean, nice decor and bathroom was clean. Outside seating was plenty for us. Free wi-if. We would return and recommend :)"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. The drinks are amazing.

Came in after a hike. There was only one employee and she was so kind. She went back and forth from making drinks to taking orders. She didn't look stress and was so patient and fast. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"Small Town Coffeehouse is a small neighborhood coffee shop near Loop 101 in northwest Phoenix. I found them using yelp of course for something outside the Starbucks world and was glad I did!

They currently brew Dazbog Coffee, but the owners are trying to source a locally roasted option. My espresso con Panna was pulled well and prompt with a clean and modern interior in which to enjoy it. Free wifi and a tv help to complete the experience.

Parking is very difficult and the location lacks a drive thru, but the Small Town Coffeehouse is a nice option in the suburban jungle."}
{"text":"I go to MWU and found this coffee place. It's way better and more affordable than some of the corporate chains around the area and walking distance from campus. I love it! The coffee isn't bitter or burnt up at all."}
{"text":"I loveeee this place! I came here for the first time and loved it. The atmosphere was super cozy. They have comfy chairs and a little area for live music. The decor is cute and rustic. I could hang out here for hours. The girl working was very friendly and had a smile on even through the big rush that came in. She was fast and made sure everyone wasn't waiting too long. The coffee was so delicious. I ordered a creme br√ªl√©e latte and it was not too sweet at all. The a√ßa√≠ bowl was also really good, but you do have to wait for it to thaw out because it was frozen. Overall a really good little spot to hang out and grab coffee."}
{"text":"So happy to have a local coffee shop back in the area! I was a huge fan of Next Coffee before it closed and now I have a new place to grab a cup of joe while getting some work done. Located on 59th Avenue, just across the street from the post office and Midwestern University's Glendale campus, Small Town is a cozy, modestly-sized coffee/tea/smoothie place with a handful of tables inside and a few patio tables outside. The inside is clean and basic. They serve up freshly-brewed Dazbog coffee and have the normal offering of specialty coffee drinks, along with some snacks. 

Very friendly staff and cool environment for hanging out with friends or catching up on email/work.

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very charming, local coffeehouse. Service is always very friendly. They make good specialty coffee, Americanos, and have free Wi-Fi. I got a Vanilla Cappuccino once and it was just okay, but I would still come back - maybe will try something else next time. I haven't seen this place really busy, but I see it's a great place for studying or just to hang out and read a book. Very quiet."}
{"text":"I ordered a good cup of Java this Saturday.  It took longer than I expected, maybe partially due to Veterans Day?  Not sure, but I will try them out again and try something else when I have more time to decide what I really want."}
{"text":"Dropped by Small Town Coffeehouse on a Saturday morning for a quick coffee break. The place was busy, but not extremely crowded. 

In terms of drinks, there are a plethora of options to choose from. There are coffee drinks, tea drinks, smoothies, and etc. They have all your regular lattes and mochas, but also offer a menu of signature drinks which include different combinations of flavors. 

Typically, my go to drink is a latte or a vanilla latte so I ordered a french kiss which includes vanilla, caramel, and mocha. The drink itself was good and the price was fair. However, it was a bit on the lukewarm side when it came out. I prefer to get my coffee piping hot so that it still has some heat after a few minutes.

There are outlets in here if you are in the mood to study and there is a giant wall of chalk art that will captivate you during your coffee break or study session. 

Overall, this place is a cute coffee shop that has a lot of potential. I will most likely drop by in the future and try other drinks. Midwestern University students do get a discount so look into that if you are interested! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I can always get in and out in the mornings. Such a cute, relaxing atmosphere inside. The baristas are always SO nice and friendly. Plus the coffee is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing little coffee house with tons to choose from. The service is fast and friendly. The drinks are way better than at those certain popular chains."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! The barista immediately greeted me as I entered through the door. Ironically, he was yelping prior to my entrance. I decided I would write a little review regarding what a wonderful job he did. First off, he was very friendly and patient, allowing me to slowly soak in the menu since it was my first time here. Secondly, he took a good amount of time chatting about the popular drinks here upon my inquiry. I settled for a medium iced caramel creme latte. It was pretty good in my books - not the best of the best, yet fairly delicious. I'm definitely planning to return and try the Russian Chai. 

I love that this place is right across from Midwestern University. This makes it super convenient for students to drop by and get their daily dose of caffeine. It's a great place to study - plenty of tables around with a very quiet/relaxing ambience. I came here around 10:30am, and parking wasn't a big issue in the small lot. I can see how parking can be difficult to find once Zipps, located across from the coffeehouse, opens at 11AM. 

I highly recommend stopping by if you're tired of Starbucks and Coffee Bean that's around the area."}
{"text":"This mama was in dire need of some coffee before work after another almost sleepless night with my 4 month old... I typically gauge all coffee shops by their lattes, but today i was feeling in a Dirty Chai mood.
I ordered a small dirty Russian Chai - with not 1, but 2 shots. I like it! The chai didn't taste like a pre-made \"just-add-water\" mix, and I liked the spiciness of their blend. The espresso hit the spot. I would definitely recommend. 

I plan on stopping by again, as it is very near to work for me. The biggest drawback is the price - my itty bitty drink cost me $5.57.... however, I realize that is about the same price for Starbucks, sooooooo. More worth it to come here. 

They had a case full of yummy looking donuts that I may need to try next time...."}
{"text":"The employees are easy-going and kind. Coffee is pretty good. It's a quiet spot and a nice corner tucked in the area. Agreed that parking is not great; but that's a fault of the plaza layout, not the shop's."}
{"text":"This place is great! The coffee is always fresh and delicious; which says a lot coming from a barista! The shop itself is fun, modern vibe. Last time I was there I had come right as they were closing (which I know is so rude) but the owner insisted on making our drinks, she was just as friendly as the other gals. Nice to see people going out of their way to make my day even better- two thumbs up for Smalltown Coffee!!"}
{"text":"This place provides great service and a friendly staff with good coffee. How can you beat that?"}
{"text":"A great place to get coffee. I was also looking for something for breakfast but they really had limited options so I settled for a small Iced French Kiss and a chocolate chip muffin. The coffee was delightful! I enjoyed it more than my hubby's iced vanilla latte. I wish they offered bigger sizes, but oh well. It's worth a visit or many visits!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because the wait at Biscuits was an hour - did not want to wait an hour.  This place was a fun surprise!  The drink menu is extensive and the food menu is enough.  We had the breakfast burritos and they were delicious- one is big enough to split.  Only reason why not 5 stars is because there was only one very hard working person for the whole place.  She did a great job but there was enough traffic to justify two people.  We will return - I must try an Elvis Mocha at some point!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and very nice people!  Within walking distance of Midwestern!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great! I like their blended carmel drink better then Starbucks. The pastries are the best coffee house selections i've ever seen. I saw the small sign by the road and wandered in... i'm glad I did! Super quick service qnd friendly people ;)"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a new local coffee house in my area! The staff are very personable and the coffee is great! Just what this area needed!"}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop locally owned. The Barista while cute was very slow and the drinks not well made. Could use a bit more training in that area because it should be hard to mess up coffee. Since we always require an afternoon pick me up and get tired of chains, it will do."}
{"text":"Found this place when I needed to get a little homework done before an appointment. The staff is very nice and service is speedy. The place is quiet and inviting. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome coffeehouse! My first visit is memorable. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"great place to get a unique coffee experience.  Great product.   Terrific vibe.   The staff was incredible.  Thank you for the terrific find!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good honey and Americano 6 shot build here. Food items are packaged. Not for me today. Nice setting and seating area in smaller newer outdoor mall area."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, especially that it's located so close to Midwestern campus! Their prices are fair, they provide a vast assortment of drinks, and they have creative specialty drinks as well. They also have a lot of sugar-free syrups for their drinks, which I appreciate! The staff is always so pleasant and peppy, like they enjoy their job! The atmosphere is good for visiting or studying, and there is ample seating. My absolute"}
{"text":"Very cozy place and they have the best coffee. Nice customer service!"}
{"text":"This is a nice shop with great coffee and a nice choice of breakfasts with fresh fruit. The music is good and the volume level is low so not to be annoying.  So why only 3 stars?

The only reason my review is 3 stars and not 5 stars is because the owner has chosen to only have ONE person working during the busy mornings. This one person becomes overwhelmed because, even making coffee takes several minutes. As people come in and the line grows, the wait time becomes unreasonable. Add food, which has to to be prepared, then the wait time becomes a real problem. People are coming in with a tight time frame because they are on their way to work.

I for example, have left many times because I don't have 10 or 15 minutes to wait around. I am not the only one. This morning while I waited for my order, I personally saw four people leave without ordering. That is business lost that will probably not return.

The prior two owners always had 2 people staffing the shop. It is not difficult to track busy times and staff accordingly. Unless, the owner does not care about understanding customer needs or has little desire to retain staff. 

Lastly, the one person working is doing an outstanding job considering how stressed and overworked they are. However, it is unreasonable to expect them to keep up with the bursts of morning traffic. Or, to enjoy their job.

May I suggest that the owner work the mornings on their own for a week to understand. That could provide a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the work load.  

By the way, customer 5 and 6 just left while I was finishing this review."}
{"text":"I got an Americano and tried the bulletproof cold brew that the gf got. I preferred the bulletproof cold brew as it has a sort of chocolate note to it. The Americano was a bit too watered down for my liking. We went a little before it closed and there wasn't anyone there. Staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Saw this cute little coffee shop when we were trying to go to Zipp's across the way. Parking is a real struggle!!! Thankfully Small Town has a couple reserved spots in front. 

They have a regular drink menu as well as a specialty drink menu. I of course tried their special drinks. I got an iced \"Nutty Hawaiian\" and my bf got a iced \"Peanut Butter Cup\". The Nutty Hawaiian taste exactly like Dutch Bros Annihilator. Overall the drinks were great and had a nice coffee shop vibe."}
{"text":"I've never been here before and actually didn't even know it was here. I didn't want to go to the big brand place so I yelped coffee and this place popped up. 
Its pretty cute and cozy inside... Not a big place, they do have a few tables outside for patio seating. I just grabbed an iced coffee... Has really good flavor. The girl at the counter was very friendly and welcoming.. I'd come back if I was in the area.
They do offer some pastries but I didn't try any."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Owner is confident you'll have the best day when he serves you...man he wasn't kidding! Try the iced mocha. Yum! A little sad the beans are not roasted locally, however they are roasted in Denver so that's interesting! Chill vibe and outdoor seating. Good luck to this new coffee house in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop, and great if you're trying to avoid the bigger coffee chains. Nice staff and a nice variety when it comes to their menu. Parking can be tricky but that's not their fault, more so the layout of the plaza. I wish they were open later in the day, they close pretty early in my opinion. Great location for Midwestern students though. If you're ever in the area I recommend you to check it out!"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as Zipp's across the street from Midwestern, this place is so cute! The staff is friendly and very helpful, especially pretty early in the morning when I can't quite function yet. There are plenty of chairs and tables if you needed to settle down and get some work done. Drinks are good, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between drinks. It just tastes like espresso to me. The biggest drawback to this place is the price. I can get the same drink but save almost $1 at Starbucks or another chain coffee shop. With it being a very student heavy area, I was somewhat taken aback at their prices. Additionally, they close fairly early (5pm on Weekdays and 2pm on Weekends I think?) which is kind of inconvenient for those who need a late night boost of caffeine. 

As the closest coffee shop to Midwestern University, this is definitely a place to try out. You definitely can't beat the convenience factor as it is walking distance to MWU and the surrounding apartment complexes where students live. I know I'll be back sometime!"}
{"text":"Great place have stopped in several times and always great customer service. I walked in at 605PM closing time looking for a cup of coffee and the had no hot coffee so they gave me an iced coffee for free."}
{"text":"Great variety. Super cozy & friendly. My 1st visit here. Love to support local over big box, corporate chains. They use local roasters (Daisy Mtn)--local is best for everyone. Kinda surprised at cost--my Nutty Hawaiian hot latte was more than $6, yikes! Other than that, no complaints. Baked goods & some chilled deli items, drinks in cooler. Comfy indoor seating--also, a few tables on front sidewalk patio with umbrellas, just too hot to enjoy those now. Give 'em a try. Go local! Corner space--across from Zipps & Midwestern University--plenty of pkg in back then walk thru."}
{"text":"I am excited there is a real coffee place nearby that I can get a good cappuccino! The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. There is a gentleman there who clearly enjoys what he is doing and makes you excited to try their coffee. We tried the burritos once, they were a little on the small side, but had nice flavor. I definitely recommend stopping by for a cup of your favorite drink!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this coffee place many times, a friend of mine told me to stop in and check it out one time cause their coffee was amazing, So I did, and I was not that impressed with the coffee especially for the price. The place is cute, and cozy inside, the staff is friendly and like the chit chat which is great. I just wasnt a big fan of their coffee not a lot of flavor or anything."}
{"text":"Went a couple different times. Found the manager to be rude when I mispronounced something from the board and the atmosphere in the place lacked that certain something to make it a great place to relax or have a meeting. It would probably help if they didn't have the TV on in the shop so we were forced to hear it and the commercials. Coffee was so-so."}
{"text":"I think I'm a bit too spoiled by Phoenix's coffee culture. I really wanted to love this place, it's quiet and has a pretty good sized menu.

I ordered a Large Iced Vanilla Latte and found it to be just okay. Definitely caffeine filled as I got a large size, but did not taste any Vanilla. I also wanted to try a pastry so I got an Apple Turnover which was heated up and served to me on a paper plate. The pastry tasted like it came from Costco. My coffee and pastry came out to be almost $10, kind of pricey IMO.

The shop itself is small and very quiet the time I was there- considering it was just me and two other customers sitting in silence. There was faint music playing from what I recall. The parking situation is also not the best here, it's difficult to find parking right out front of the cafe so be prepared to walk. Unfortunately, I won't be returning to this small town coffeehouse :*("}
{"text":"Friendly service, and amazing coffee! If you haven't tried Dazbog coffee...try it, it has amazing rich flavor."}
{"text":"\"This is the best smoothie I have ever tasted!\" This was the comment from my son. The shop was clean and cozy. The service was fast and friendly. The prices were competitive."}
{"text":"This place is so nice! They had SO MANY FLAVORS to choose from! The store has a very nice atmosphere, the decor is trendy and artsy. The staff are very nice, and I feel like I could spend all day in here. I got a peppermint latte and it was very good, quality coffee, not too sweet, it was perfect."}
{"text":"Overall, I like this place and it's convenient location across from midwestern, but I wish there was a larger selection of pastries to choose from, and that milk substitutions didn't cost so much (for example, when my girlfriend ordered a small chai with soy milk instead of regular milk, it came out to over $5.50!!) There could also be more seating, but the location is small, so there's not much that can be done about that. It's nice to have something other than a Starbucks or coffee bean in the area too"}
{"text":"My husband is currently getting a sleeve done by a tattoo shop in the same complex. He gets one tattoo a month and always go with him just so I can go to small town coffeehouse! It's amazing, there is nothing as good as it where I live in surprise . I love their peppermint mocha and their iced caramel coffee. I am going to try a new drink every month."}
{"text":"Since switching owners, i've recommended five others to go in for a second option of Small Town Coffee. The new ambience of light-heartedness and compassion make for one of the best customer service experiences I've had at a coffee shop!. Perfect for computer work or studying. Highly recommended a chiller with ice coffee and cinnamon syrup :) !"}
{"text":"Discovered this little coffee shop this afternoon. I was impressed with the customer service and the cleanliness of the shop! I tried the blended red tux at the recommendation of the staff and i was not disappointed! I will be back if i have the chance!"}
{"text":"Small Town Coffeehouse is just what the neighborhood needed! It's the perfect location, good size, and staffed by awesome people. This coffee shop is nice and cozy, making it the perfect place to study, hangout, or conduct a meeting. The owner and staff are not only talented baristas but also super personable and dedicated to making your visit here one to remember. I highly recommend an iced White Russian Chai, as it's quickly become my favorite drink on the menu. The breakfast burritos are really yummy too!"}
{"text":"I thought it was rude that when I purchased an iced tea today that the gal at the counter moved her tip jar around twice and motioned towards it as if i should leave a tip. I'm a server and always 
tip very well.  I would have tipped her but I decided not to because I found her gesture unprofessional"}
{"text":"Cozy feel and comfortable space although there isn't a ton of indoor seating. Good prices an amazing tea and coffee selections. Also has a decent variety of healthful snacks and bfast items."}
{"text":"Fun and friendly staff.  They came out and chatted with us.  Had the Carmel Chiller -  Stunningly good!"}
{"text":"I came to Small Town Coffeehouse with my girlfriend and spend about an hour. Being a former barista, I watched the girl behind the counter break about every rule - with a few being serious health rules. First, the milk she used to make a coffee sat on the counter for about a hour. She made what I'm think was a latte using a thermometer with a metal steam pitcher that she never cleaned once since I sat there. Additionally, she never wiped down the steam wand which will contaminate the next drink. She has been drawing on a chalkboard in between sneezing and waiting on customers and hasn't washed her hands once! That was all before she reheated her personal drink (that she is drinking out of) with the same uncleaned steam wand. I am so disgusted by what I saw and will never be back. And I really hope the burnt coffee I just drank from here doesn't get me sick. If I could post zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Love this quaint little place in North Phoenix/Glendale.  They make great coffee and even have a few snacks.  Interior is very nice and has some cozy chairs and a TV.  Service was great, and owner was friendly.  Support local business and give these guys a shot to earn your business over Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Visiting Midwestern university with my daughter.  Found this neat coffee house.  Ordered the nutty Hawaiian specialty latte.  The drink is great, the place is cozy and staffs are friendly.  They recommended places to visit in Scottsdale.   Made me feel welcome!!"}
{"text":"Small Town Coffeehouse is an unassuming little place visible from 59th Ave two block south of 101 freeway. They have big selection of coffee drinks and very intimate dining area where people sit to catch up or do some work on their laptops.  There are plenty of outlets to plug in your devices and games on the tables to play. They also have a giant chalk board wall with chalks for guests to doodle on. 

The best part was my drink. I was in the mood for something sweet so I opted for soy mocha. It wasn't too sweet, just perfectly sweet enough to satisfy my cravings. I ordered a medium which came in a huge cup but managed to sip til I saw the bottom of the cup. 

What a wonderful place to hang out. I will definitely stop by here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is such a great cafe! The owner is so friendly! My go-to drink here is the Americano, but the fancier coffees are also delicious and the prices are very competitive. I definitely suggest supporting this locally owned business!"}
{"text":"We had the sunrise breakfast burrito with coffee 
Coffee was excellent , the burrito was delicious 
Staff is extremely friendly , I love going to small family run establishments , Steve the owner is fun to talk to and Emerson makes GREAT coffee"}
{"text":"I came here a while ago and at first I was like this seems like a good spot to have a nice cup of coffee along with reading a good book, a friend of mine came in and we were chatting for a while. This was a Saturday at about 11 am, and as we were chatting it up we were told that they were going to be closing pretty soon which I though was strange because 1. It was a Saturday and you would think they would want to stay open for business and 2. it was 11am.

Oh well I just though it was strange and I see the time now that they are opened until 6pm, so maybe they changed the time. Its just not a place I would bother going back to, its in a good location but I dont think its worth it to go out of your way and try this place."}
{"text":"I'm from Columbus, OH where there are a lot of mom and pop coffee houses. This is the FIRST truly unique coffee house that isn't a famous chain that I have come across and have been thrilled with. I'm a huge supporter of small businesses and I appreciate that this will be my new coffeehouse on my way into work. Phenomenal staff, great tasting coffee (I didn't experience the bitter aftertaste that you might get from a big chain coffee place). I absolutely loved the atmosphere walking in. 5 Star Service, 5 Star Coffee, 5 Star Satisfied customer. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place! The syrup flavors are variant and many to choose from! They have only medium and dark roast but considering the different amount of flavors, it makes up for only having the two roasts. The girls are friendly, place is clean and the people are open. Amazingly priced for the wonderful flavor. I had a medium roast, with macadamia nut syrup, added vanilla powder, half& half with 1/2 packet of raw cane sugar. Ah-mazing! I'm grateful for finding this little spot. :)"}
