{"text":"Food sucked. Better in sun valley. The turkey burger was mush on a roll not even shaped like a burger. I'll drive the extra next time"}
{"text":"The regular burgers are too small, go for the large...however, stuff is expensive here and quality not that great...I have lately experienced dry meat and stale buns. Like the homemade shakes, especially the special creamsicle one they featured.

Although this place isn't bad in a pinch, I would opt for Red Robin, Cook Out, or Five Guys first."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Service was slow and disinterested.  Shake machine was down for cleaning during the dinner hour.  SMH. With lots of other burger alternatives in the area, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, its affordable and the burgers taste awesome! I also loved how polite the staff was!"}
{"text":"Great service, Great burgers, great fries, great onion rings & free refills! Loved it. Will come back. Wish I wasn't too full. I'd try a milkshake. Looks good!"}
{"text":"Giving this place one stars for fixing the problem but should be one star for the way it was handled should be zero. Came in to this god forsaken place tonight to have a nice quick bite during the rain storm. Greeted and ordered which was amazing, cashier was very friendly. I ordered the mess burger which sounded great on the menu and it was an ok burger for what is was. Here is where they went wrong, wife ordered build your own burger. Normal patty wheat bun some toppings and mushrooms with NO CHEESE. Burger then comes out with a corner with cheese on it not a big deal it's a corner she picks it off; must have picked it up from another burger on the grill maybe even mine that's fine. No big deal, I start to enjoy mine little by little it's good. She takes one bite it looks pretty good into the second bite she asks about how pink it is and it looks way for pink than mine but we continue so she picks the meat apart to find the constinecy of a burger should not be served at that quality of pink. I don't have to be a food science major to tell you that once a hamburger is ground up the skin tension is broken and the germs and bacteria can enter the patty. Steaks are ok the eat rare never a hamburger patty, no tensile strength to protect the meat from bacteria penetrating it. I take the 2/3 of my wife's burger back to counter greeted once again by a nice gentlemen who responds approiately then takes my burger and I ask that I get a new one that could be cooked a little more. I work in the customer service industry as well and understand aspects of customer service, our interaction was pleasant he said I'll take care of it I smiled and thanked him. Then enter whom I'm guessing was the manger a tall man in a green shirt with blonde hair carrying the new burger, he slings it down asks that she cut it open to make sure it's cooked \"to her perfection\" which is fine I understand that. Then proceeds to tell us that listen folks we cook things automatic here so (in a very condescending tone) you need to make sure that you order it well next time so we don't have issues you like. We said oh sorry we didn't understand that, thinking to my self that in an automatic process my burger was on a different rarity scale than hers and that you should serve something that is cooked to a reasonable, edible tempature that can be consumed. He also didn't return with any fries that she hadn't barely touched that disappeared with the original burger. 

Give this place a chance on the surface only to be shot down and talked down at by upper management and get served raw/barely cooked bloody burgers. 


Horrible"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Spent $80 on food and went back to order milkshakes and I got an eye roll from the cashier."}
{"text":"Really good burger and onion rings. I have the special route 66, which is an onion ring on the burger with barbecue sauce on both sides, and bacon. Burgers are very fresh and handmade. Good meal"}
{"text":"Burgers are good and was pleased to order medium rare. Salad was good too. Dont love the fries. Employees are kind of dim-bulbs- high school kids more invested in talking to their friends. 

So so place"}
{"text":"There's nothing worse than looking forward to a burger and fries with an extra side of onion rings only to be completely disappointed. We ordered take out on Sunday, September 28, 2014 to the tune of just over $30.00 

We ordered two turkey burgers and the buns were not fresh. The burgers were big, but bland and not good at all. How hard is it to mess up a burger?  We had one large order of fries that were served in two cups. They were not crispy nor hot and lacked flavor. The regular order of onion rings were not edible. They were so soggy that just simply picking one up to eat made all of the breading fall off the onion. There was nothing crispy about them and they were really greasy. The best thing we had were the two chocolate milk shakes and that's not saying much. 

I have never written a review on here before, but felt it was worth sparing someone else a big disappointment, especially for such an expensive meal. 

No second chances for this place - skip it."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are ok. Five Guys aross the street has a much better burger. I wasnt really impressed with the burger at BTs. If you are going to do one thing, do it well."}
{"text":"We were first timers and it was suprisingly good.We each 'built our own' burger and shared the fried pickles/fries. Good choice of toppings and cool beer offerings...We will definitely be back.. although next time will make them double patties"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Cheeseburger salad is great! Allergy friendly for my son too!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed is the price. The price is high for the quality you receive. The sweet tea was not good, very bitter. I ordered the cheese steak and it came out very sloppy, thrown together. The worst part was the bun was cold! The cheese was overwhelming and tasted like baseball stadium cheese. The only good part about our meal was the fries. The fries were tasty. Crisp on the outside soft on the inside.
Oh and the table was dirty and sticky.

Overall I was unsatisfied and won't come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent fries and great burgers. Interior design of the restaurant was great as well."}
{"text":"This place has awesome burgers that are hand made when you order them. They are pricey, but you get what you pay for. And they always have the day's sports running on all their HDTVs, which gives a nice vibe. Their outdoor seating area is covered, and really nice too."}
{"text":"Walking into BT's Burgerjoint, one is immediately greeted by the laid back vibe of a beachfront burger bar. Blue walls adorned with surfboards, naked light bulbs strung from posts, and a mix of Carolina and California beach music drifts from the speakers welcoming customers.

Ordering is made easy by following the directions on the menu boards. Choose an award winning burger, hot dog or chicken, then dress it up with cheese, bacon and toppings of your choice. Several salad options are also available; though the Grilled Chicken Salad proved to be bland, and the Ranch dressing was clearly not housemade. 

It is the Hand-Cut Sweet Potato Fries drizzled with Honey Butter that deserve a special mention, though. Warm, tender and salty sweet potato fingers lightly fried and complemented by the sticky sweet Honey Butter induce fried tater euphoria for fry connoisseurs and novices alike. If you are dedicated to their regular hand cut fries, try a Half And Half for the best of both.

Service and wait times are inconsistent at BT's. Long lines at lunch are unacceptable for those on a limited lunch hour or who are attempting to appease the hungry preschool set. However, when the staff isn't slammed, they are attentive and kind. 

BT's Burgerjoint is located at 14130 Rivergate Parkway in Charlotte and can be reached at 704-494-7356."}
{"text":"I will travel far and wide for a juicy burger - now I have them in my backyard!  Woot, woot!  Very impressed with the service, staff knowledgeable and took our order promptly.  Nice selection of beer, no 5-star because of wine selection - only one label and it is funky at best.  But burgers more than made up for this.  Served with a steak knife (nice touch) for carving up the burger - like the choice of 6 oz or 8 oz burger - chose the 6 oz and could not finish it.  Fresh toppings and fries were hot and salty - yum-o - will be back!"}
{"text":"The Turkey Burgers Here Are Great....The Fries Are Great As Well...This Will Definitely Be My New Spot To Eat At..."}
{"text":"First visit tried the 8oz bt bacon cheeseburger.  When asked what temp I wanted I thought I hit the jackpot.  It's so nice to order a burger the way I liked it, which in medium rare.  Unfortunately, if only the burger arrived at that temp.  Burger was more med well.  Very disappointing.  When I was ordering and watching the kid smash the burgers on the flat top I had a suspicion that the burger would arrive over cooked. Bacon was thick and tasty. Not overcooked.  Cheddar cheese was lacking in flavor.  Could barely taste it.    Usually I would send it back but I was hungry and didn't have time to waste.  Tater tots were crispy and cooked perfectly.  Nice and crispy and not over greasy.  Servers were around constantly to check on drink refills.  BT's is the only burger joint in the area so they will do well.  I'll go back and hopefully they can train their cooks a little better."}
{"text":"Good burger, but pricey.  Skimpy sides.  Shaky service.  Very shaky service...  I'm probably not going back.  Five Guys is a much better option and right across the street."}
{"text":"I highly don't recommend this place if you are looking for a place to eat. I have went there multiple times since it opened to now and it was never that good. I have had things there from burgers to salads to cheesesteaks and I never had high expectations for anything only something decent, especially since I was in a rush. All of the food was disgusting, the food came out cold, greasy, and not very flavorful and the water tastes very much like the lemonade. Unfortunately the food wasn't even the worst part, the sanitation was awful. The bathrooms were not clean at all and there was water everywhere and the tables were dirty and no one was cleaning them, and when I went to look at the kitchen, the stoves where full of fatty liquid lard looking stuff that they don't wipe down. Luckily the service there was good and the people that work there were very nice. I hope they get better but for now I highly recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the new sign saying American burger company. Same people same lousy service. After standing there for 15 minutes waiting to place an order only to see one of the people walk away from the register when it was our turn. I've always had bad service experience here. The food has always been good, but not good enough for me to put up with the horrible service."}
{"text":"Not bad but I expected more for the price and competition in the area. Bad Daddy's makes a better burger and has a better beer selection"}
{"text":"I'm writing an update on my review for this place.  In the fall of 2014 we were told that we would receive a full refund on our food for slow service.  The refund never processed through my credit card so I gave this place a 3 star rating.  Recently the general manager reached out to me and confirmed that we should have received the full refund but there was on operational error that prevented it from processing.  The manager gave me and my family a free meal in the amount of $32.  This is excellent customer service! When we went back the staff was really nice and even offered to give us a free desert on the house.  The service was also very fast.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at the Promenade BT's last night, and the experience was unpleasant. We arrived about 15 minutes before closing, and when greeted by the friendly and cheerful young lady behind the counter, I asked if it was too late to order and eat-in. She assured me that it was not. My daughter and I order our burgers, both medium-well. My burger arrived well-done (no pink), which is acceptable to me. I'd rather have a burger overdone then undercooked. My daughter's burger was obviously undercooked. It was dark pink throughout the center. We informed the friendly waitress/server that my daughter's burger was undercooked, and she happily took the burger to have the error corrected. I should note that a woman at a table next to ours also sent her burger back for being undercooked. She asked for well-done, but received a burger that was dark pink.

A minute later, a sweaty man with a shirt buttoned down to show his chest tattoos arrived with my daughter's burger and told us that the burger is indeed medium-well. He asked how she wanted the burger, so I reiterated that the burger should be medium-well, a little pink (as your intuitive burger chart indicates). He argued that the burger was a little pink. In hindsight, I should've taken a photo of the burger, but it was certainly not a little pink. The burger was dark pink throughout the center. I showed the man my overcooked burger that was also ordered medium-well, and pointed out the discrepancy between the two burgers ordered the same way. He stated that he wasn't arguing, but insisted that my daughter's burger was medium-well. He then asked how she wanted her burger, and I said, once again, \"a little pink\", and he said \"so, well-done?\" At that point, I said, \"ok, no pink\", figuring that would make it easier for the man to understand. The man returned a few minutes later with two burgers, one for my daughter, and one for the other lady with an undercooked burger. Unbelievably, both burgers now had the wrong toppings. The man switched the two burgers, thinking that he just crossed the delivery, but they were both still wrong. My daughter took the burger anyway because we didn't want to be there any longer than necessary (and her burger was at least not undercooked), but the other lady sent back the burger again to get the right toppings.

At this point, it was a few minutes past 9pm. It seemed to me that the cooks might've been rushing out burgers since it was closing time, they were at the end of a shift, they probably wanted to get to work on their closing tasks. I understand and accept that, which is why I asked if it was too late to order and eat-in. I would've gladly ordered to go, or left without ordering and driven to Five Guys without any resentment. However, the team committed to serving us (and the two groups who walked in after me and my daughter). The servers were friendly, but the inconsistent cooks and the condescending man who felt that he had to confront us to tell us that we were wrong, that our undercooked burger was indeed medium-well, told us what we were really asking for was a well-done burger (despite asking for a burger with a little pink), and seemed to have completely missed the problem of inconsistency between two burgers ordered the same way (mine was overcooked) reflects very poorly on your business. Their burgers and shakes are delicious when done correctly, but poor service trumps quality product.

Unfortunately for BT's, there are other burger joints in town with much better service. I don't know if we'll return to BT's. If we do, I'll know that it's much simpler to order our burgers well-done to avoid uncomfortable exchanges with their managers."}
{"text":"We had a pretty bad experience. A couple of things were the cause:

1. Ordered a burger with fried pickles on it, but then when we got our order we got an order of fried pickles and were charged for them. We got our money back, but they still charged for the pickles on the burger and didn't apologize. 

2. Bacon cheeseburger didn't have cheese on it when I got it. Pretty weird. 

3. Food was something we could have made at home. Fries had almost no seasoning. 

We were just unimpressed with this place. We went be going again and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Finally,  this time my burger wasn't raw in the center. Probably because it wasn't a busy time. Few customers and even the workers weren't motivated to clean all the messy tables.  Lazy."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Manager is very involved,  ensures all needs are exceeded.  So worth the salads and burgers to drive!
Try the fried pickles and salmon salad.  Yes, even at a burger joint."}
{"text":"Bill W. brings up a very good point in his review.  I ate at BT's around 8:15 on a Saturday night with my fiance and was extremely disappointed.  I took notes on a receipt as I sat and ate because I was so horrified.  Let me preface this review with two things: 1, I worked in food service as a cashier and as a shift supervisor for 8 years and 2, BT's was not busy whatsoever so there is absolutey no excuse for the following! 
-The first thing I noticed was that the floor was filthy.  Receipts, food, paper products, etc.  It probably didn't help that line cooks were throwing small food items FROM THE LINE at one another.
-The glass on the cooler had dried splatters from the milkshake machine on it, it probably hadn't been wiped down for at least a month.
-There were rags everywhere...counter tops, spray bottles, in the gloved hands of a line cook (gross!)
-The manager was worthless.  I didn't see him do a lick of work except to clear a total of 2 tables in the 45 minutes we were there.  He was obviously more interested in texting than running a restaurant.  He also walked by our table at least 5 times and never once made an actual table visit.
-One employee in particular had sagging pants (this isn't jail) and ate directly from the line.  This same employee brought the bag of ketchup out to a table and proceeded to fill the ketchup bottles at the table, something I feel should be done in the kitchen.
-I know for certain drinks are not allowed to sit at the register.
-Not once did I see any line cook change their gloves.

Needless to say, I will not visit BT's again."}
{"text":"Huge portions!  The build your own turkey burger is enormous.  Good selection of beers, several varieties on tap also."}
{"text":"visited sunday april 27th ,ordered the bt burger with fries,three other adults and two children ordered also, after 20 minutes burgers came but fries were being delayed for another 10 minutes,tea station was out of tea,my burger had items that i did not add to burger, the kids meal came with ice cream but were out of chocolate. i paid around $12.00 for my meal, last visit here!"}
{"text":"BT's burgers are better than a ton of other burger joints...so I'm having a hard time understanding all the animosity.  Since I have only been here once...maybe they just got lucky?

That said, the inside of BT's has a laid back appeal to it.  The place is clean and well maintained.  I liked that you could see the cooks and everything was laid out in the open.

I ordered my burger medium-well...and I got it medium-well.  The ingredients I added were scaled down to avoid a drippy mess, and my burger was juicy and flavorful.

My buddy and I also ordered a small order of fried pickles to share.  This is where BT's loses a star from me.  Five barely breaded pickle slices come out with a small carafe of ranch.  My buddy and I immediately looked at each other like...\"WHAT!\"  My buddy asked them to take them back and refund our money...no problem.

The kid who brought us our burgers came back with another batch of fried pickles...that had a little more care put into them...but still a tiny portion for over three dollars...and gave them to us on the house.  My friend told him not to worry about the refund.  I could tell the kid was originally annoyed to take the pickles back...but sorry, that's just part of the job.  Those pickles need some major work in terms of quality and quantity BT's!

Lastly, the buns could use some work.  Warm them, then grill em.  Aside from those couple small things...the portion size was nice, the taste was good, and the price...not super bad...but in comparison...I'd make like some of the other reviews and go to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of BT's Burger Joint after they opened.  My last experience will make it very difficult to return.  
The manager had part of the dining area closed for floor cleaning. Employee's were taking money, moving mop buckets around the area and then delivering food.  All this with out washing their hands.  Manager was also guilty of not washing hands between operations and food handling.
Employee working the grill, sneezed into his hands then touched cooking utensils without washing hands.
This is really a shame the management was not setting the example of food safety.  
Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Don't understand  the hype. Way overpriced, was still hungry when I left."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of craft beers as well as delicious food and kind service. Pretzel burger I had was amazing."}
{"text":"Really good burgers with many different combinations. Even have a competition to eat a 40 oz burger in 20 minutes. WOW! Have at it. It is very good but is very big."}
{"text":"Change in ownership.  The burgers are noticably different and I don't like the change.  It tastes like the quality is not the same. Very disappointed.

I really enjoyed the restaurant in the past.  Now, I would go elsewhere for a burger I enjoy."}
{"text":"Burgers were okay. We ordered three burgers and a salad. My wife said the salad was great. We asked for the burgers to be medium and they came out well done (no pink inside).

The tater tots and sweet potato fries were okay also."}
{"text":"Very dry burger.Nothing to knock your socks off about.Or call to mom and dad about.5 guys is better."}
{"text":"Food was ok, way over priced for what u get. Got a turkey burger and it looked like they took it straight out of the freezer. Not very good and looked awful."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for two burgers. They were both burnt and almost inedible. Will not be returning- not worth the wait or the cost."}
{"text":"Delicious burger cooked perfect to order! So far best burger in town! Super nice employees, and clean tables :) a must!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place zero stars but this is not an option.  Let me start by saying if you are reading this to pick a burger place,  just go to Five Guys.  For a fast food place the food took over 30 minutes to arrive. The person who brought the food said something about there being a mixup with the chicken.  They did not offer any compensation for the extreemly long wait time.  Once the food arrived we realized that our order was incorrect.  What is the point of creating a custom burger if they get the toppings wrong? I ordered a turkey burger with avacado on it and they left off the avacado.   When they fixed it there was one slice of avacado split in two pieces.  Yes and I paid $1.00 for that.  The burger tasted awful and was soggy like it had sat somewhere under a heat lamp for 20 minutes.  Needless to say poor service,  bad food,  and unhelpful staff means we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. they have fund raiser nights . service is alway great because everyone is working hard and being short staff sometime is normal.  David V and Mike B. you guys are not happy then go somewhere else. Post bad reviews for what ? Only when google make robot to serve you guys then you will be satisfy? or only god come down then serve you guys then you would stop your whining? If god or your friends know what you wrote online about all these hard working people I wonder what they have to say about you. David V. are one of the most horrible yelp reviewer on yelp right now. Just because you can go online and write bad reviews doesn't make you better than others. you are just lowlife gossiper with many years of crock itches or something. david you are like the living devil with a big mouth.  Seriously dude.  Calling overprice food? then just go somewhere else? twisting people words or telling others they are dishonesty if you have no proof will cause you to loose your tongue ?!? You get mad and no one to talk to so you go on yelp and wrote all these stupid stuff? david you are just like the ugly of trolls of yelp that no one care about. Be a better man and be a part of  a solution not the problem"}
{"text":"One word:overpriced.  I got the basic chicken sandwich ($5.95) and although it had a good flavor, it was very tough (see picture...and the sandwich itself was $5.95 with no sides).  Service was slow and yet there was no line.  We tried this place several times when it first opened and swore we wouldn't go back, but we were given a gift card so we gave it another try...save your money and go to Cook Out."}
{"text":"went back a few weeks after our first visit, figuring I'd risk something turning up disappointing a second time around ..... nope, everything was great.  Fried pickles, fries, burgers .... onion rings were among the best.  It was all very good.  No complaints, this place will become a regular for us."}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted to the California turkey burger.  Great place for a cheap family meal. Kids love the burgers and the sweet potato fries are killer. Get the honey glaze on the side."}
{"text":"I really want to love BT's Burger Joint because it is a burger place near us, but I just find it as okay.  

We have been here two times.  The first time I got a burger, which was good, but this time I got the Philly Steak, it was quite bland.  Not sure what needed changing, but it I left unimpressed.  Also, the bottom bun was soggy and fell apart when trying to eat the sandwich.  Kevin had a burger both times, and he enjoyed it.  The first time we had fries, and I did not like them at all, which is disappointing as I love fries with my burgers!  This time we went with a side of Fried Pickles and they are pretty good, would get those again.

I have no complaints about the staff, they seemed fine both times.  The one odd thing I noticed was the Harris Teeter cereal box on their counter.  Apparently this month they had a fruity pebbles milkshake.  If you want to be cheap with your choices, that's fine, but do you really need that on display?  

I'm sure we will be back, but it won't be at my choice."}
{"text":"I've been here about four times now. I'll start with the cons. 

They hire younger people here and it seems overstaffed for such a small location. Even with all of the employees, it takes me forever to get my food every time. For this last time in particular, many people who ordered after us received their food before us and the manager (I guess) came to our table twice to apologize without me even inquiring on the long wait. That's either good or bad, depending on how you look at it I guess.

I've tried their burger back when I was a carnivore. It was over-cooked and dry. The condiments and toppings that you pay extra for were so minimal that it didn't do anything to negate the dryness of the burger. Other people I know love their burgers, and since I can hardly even stomach looking at a dead cow on a bun, I probably am not the best judge of the beef patty.  

The black bean burger was alright, although it fell apart too easily. This is common of black bean burgers, but I find the better made black bean patties to have some firmness to them. This didn't. I still stuffed my face with it though. This last visit was when I tried their BBB and it was also the time it took absolutely forever to be served, so I wonder if they mash the ingredients upon ordering? I don't know. It did seem fresh. 

The prices aren't low but aren't anything to complain about either. If comparing value with quality, I would probably choose somewhere else. However, a lot of people I know love their burgers. With that being said, I really don't want to sway you readers in that regard. 

The good.
It's in Rivergate, an area I enjoy. I am a fan of their fries, sweet potato fries, and fried pickles. I like their ordering system. They have it organized to where you pick your meat, toppings, condiments, etc. as you order and it's all spelled out rather fluidly. They also sell beer! I love beer! They also have an outside patio area for those beautiful days and nights when you want to eat outside and enjoy the fresh air and nice atmosphere of Rivergate, which is an often very busy but still manages to be laid-back. Sometimes there is live music. 

I have yet to try their veggie burger and I do plan on coming back. My girlfriend likes it, and it's hard to find a decent veggie burger in the area, or rather, it's hard to find any veggie burger in the area. I was never a fan of their meat, and since the black bean burger was ok, I would say that it's exactly what three stars say; A-OK. 

Bottom line... the location is top notch, the food is ok, the service can be slow, the management is polite, and the prices are average. And they have beer."}
{"text":"Wow... What happen to this place? It used to be great.  Something has changed.  The burger was dry and cold.  The buns were falling apart in my hands from being old.   Waitresses didn't come by to check.  After telling the the waitress, not even a sorry or, I'll make this right... Just \"I'll tell the cook\".  This was my last try at this place.  Five-guys down the road is much better and accommodating.  Bad Daddy's even better."}
{"text":"Meh. Maybe a step up from fast-food burgers in quality of food, but lacks taste.
I got the American burger and ended up putting a good bit of the BT sauce on it for some sort of taste. We got the regular fires and they were rather dry and tasteless too. 
Food was plenty and fresh. Service is great and quick. 
Overall I wasn't too trilled with the food and maybe come back if I'm really hungry and stuck around Promenade shopping center."}
{"text":"An even better experience this retrun trip to BT's at the request of my inlaws!  I had the grilled chicken sandwich this time and it was excellent with american cheese, red onions, lettuce and a little bit of mayo...prepared exactly the way I ordered it!  My husband had a burger again and was pleased with it and the half and half fries were even better this time!  He ordered a chocolate shake with oreo add ins and it was delish!!!! Almost $26 price point is still a little high in my opinion, but it was indeed good and we could keep up with the NCAA tourney while we sat and chatted (usually a turn off to have tvs, but this time it was okay...lol...GO HEELS)

I am impressed with the offerings at BT's...and their service has been great and I'm happy to recommend it again!"}
{"text":"I think this location is now called American Burger.  with the same menu plus a few additional.  I had the Southwest Salad.  Wow.  so savory.  Every yummy texture from the chicken to the crunchy lettuce and soft cheese and the tortilla strips, the dressing was out of this world.  My buddy built a burger on a pretzel bun and with tater tots.  I finished both for her!  I don't even love burgers or tater tots...but they were out of this world, and I ate them cold after they had sat for a while.

The service was friendly and helpful and this was certainly a five star experience.  In fact, I will go there tonight with my two sons.  I love this place.  Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger!!!!  And the strawberry milkshake is superb.  Fries are decent but the  winner of the side items here are the sweet potato fries with honey butter!  Little expensive but I imagine the quality of the ingredients is the reason for it."}
{"text":"Cute place but customer ordering flow was a bit odd.  Burgers cooked perfectly with a wide variety of toppings.  Great kids' meals.  Milkshake was very disappointing - I find Chik-Fil-A to taste MUCH better.  Won't be running back, but I think it will do well in this location."}
{"text":"The family and I checked out this spot on a Saturday evening. There happened to be a live band outside, so patio seating was packed. I agree with the other posters that the order takers appear a little spacey and very young, yet  they got our order right. :)  The turkey burgers were pretty tasty and not dry --some places tend to overcook.  We were iffy on the sweet potato fries which we split because they were like close to $3.  They were not crispy enough for us and the honey butter glaze was too much which made them soggier.  We enjoyed our meal, but it is pretty pricey for burgers and a shared order of fries."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite after church and loved it. Had the California turkey burger (trying to be healthy) and expected it to taste...healthy. It tastes awesome! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, burgers are juicy but not greasy. You can build your own burger which is nice. Service is always great and they even have a nice outdoor seating patio. I recommend getting the tots for a side, they are always good."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of fast-casual burger places these days and I have to say this place seems to be pretty average.  I ordered a turkey burger and decided to split an order of fries with my dining companion.  I decided to just go with lettuce, tomato, and cheddar as toppings.  The  burger was fine - not too dry, but also nothing really exciting or memorable.   The fries were pretty tasty.  Service was fine for a fast-casual place. While this is not my favorite type of place, for a quick & inexpensive casual bite to eat, this place is ok."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a shopper/visitor to The Promenade, but there are plenty of nice eateries, places to shop, hang out, and relax. BT's opened their second location here on the corner of one of the strips and seems to be a nice addition to the burger scene in Crown Town. Though I see some hiccups, bottlenecks, and negatives, this place serves up some comparable fare for those craving one of America's favorites foods between two slices of bread.

We made it in for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. The interior is almost a curved shape with the main line funneling down the center of the restaurant. This is one of the biggest losses. It doesn't utilize the space well and tends to create an odd line that blocks walkways for the rest of the restaurant traffic and staff. I think this can be circumvented easily, however. The staff is awesome, thoughtful, and kind. Very nice people all around. 

Again, it was busy, but it did take over 15 minutes for our food to be brought to our table (two salads and two burgers). Not the biggest deal in the world. I was just really hungry, haha. 

I ordered the custom salad. Spinach/ice berg, jalepenos, black beans, shrooms, carrots, chickpeas, a veggie burger for protein and the balsamic. The salad, although delicious, was so skimpy. A cereal sized bowl and definitely not worth the price. If it were even 25% larger, it would be worth it. I was just craving a bit more of the additional veggies and would have loved to have seen more in the bowl...and a larger bowl at that. 

Though I cannot comment on the burgers, they look absolutely fantastic. The care that is taken is evident and their product really does look amazing. Looking forward to coming back fora burger...or three!

BIG BONUS! They have a 40/20 challenge! 40oz burger in 20 minutes. I can't WAIT to try this!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great burgers. Big and juicy. Great, quick service, good prices, and the best strawberry milk shakes EVER! Excellent patty melts too. You don't see those around too often."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, really good burgers!  Wasn't s huge fan of the slaw on Carolina burger but it was a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Let's start with good news! BT Burger is now American Burger. The onion rings are a must have when you visit. The burgers & fries tasted like they were left over from lunch. Unfortunately it was dinner time. Folks that came in after us, waited longer for their food than we did and I witnessed fresh burgers being placed on the grill. Fries are served in an oversized basket, served mildly warm and weren't enough to share. Did I mention the crispy onion rings? The saving grace was we used coupons but I expect AB to go the way of BT's if this is the best they got~:-("}
{"text":"First time here.  Burger was nothing special.  As a matter of fact... I thought it was quite small for a \"customer\" burger place. 
Staff periodically walked to tables asking if anyone needed refills.  After sitting for 20+ minutes... Nothing. 

Given the disappointing and \"flavorless\" hamburger and lack of attention to their customers, I this will be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"We wanted to try somewhere close. We had some coupons for BT's so we decided to give it a try. When you walk in, you go to the register to order, pay (I forgot the coupon), and take a number. For the atmosphere and the price, I was surprised how big the burger was. I did the build-your-own-burger option and got bacon and pimento cheese with a side of tater tots. The burgers are cooked to order, and mine was a perfect medium. Actually cooked better than many burgers I've ordered at less casual places. The pimento cheese was ok and I could have done with a little crispier bacon, but I suppose that is a preference. Overall, I was impressed by the meal."}
{"text":"Great food !!! 
The honey butter that comes with the sweet potato fries is delicious ! It's like a sweet condensed milk texture/taste but better!! 
Burger is pretty tasty too ! The price range is not bad and portion is just right! 
The sunny side up burger is awesome they also asks you how would you like the egg cooked. They also have the build your own burger/salad option if you'd like to be creative.
Oh and they have a good selections of beer too!"}
{"text":"Most def the second best burger place in charlotte, next to my fave Kickstand. Craft beer, sweet potatoe fries and honey butter. Most def would go back again."}
{"text":"We didn't stop to eat. We parked our truck and horse trailer in the only large enough spot to run in Mcdonalds which was across the street to use the restroom at 10:30 in the morning. BTs doesn't open till 11! The owner was outside and asked if we were going to be long because we were using up 6 of his parking spots and it was lunch hour. Rude!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and over all amazing experience!

Pros:
Funky theme, surfboards on walls;
Juicy, succulent burgers;
A zillions toppings to select from; or
Choose a few pre made burgers! Pretzel Burger was my fave!;
Great for kids and families!;
Frozen grapes for a side for kids! How fun;
Fresh cut, skin on fries!
BT sauce on every table -- thier signature sauce... My best descrition is honey mustard mixed with bbq sauce! Sooo zesty with a kick!;
Fresh rolls for burger!
Beers on tap! I saw blue moon!

Cons:
No SELF SERVE refills, they refill them for you. No biggie. Just like to refill when I want. Ya know?

Fries portions were a lil small! But still plump portion.

Overall...

Great place!  Check it out... You will be pleased!  Better than 5 guys!!  We will be back. What a great family experience. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"So I will be short and sweet with this place. I wanted to love it but really just didn't like it at all. The burgers were okay. Not bad and not good which honestly isn't really a good sign. The sides were awful, seriously just gross (fried pickles, fries, and onion rings were tried). We didn't finish them they were so bad. They hadn't made unsweet tea and it took them almost 20 minutes to make some. At that point we had gotten our food and were almost done. I can't imagine we would ever come back here, not even for a second chance as there are better burger places. I will second another reviewer who said they appear to be overstaffed and yet service is slow. There are a million teenagers working here and yet nothing appears to get done. They are mostly all nice and polite but seem highly ineffective."}
{"text":"The BT Cheeseburger is large and very tasty, certainly enough to fill you up without needing any sides.
If I'm ever in Charlotte again, this will definitely be on my list of places to visit."}
{"text":"On my first visit (which was takeout), I did enjoy the food, it was indeed a good meal, however I paid with my debit card and threw the receipt in my bag, not really paying attention to the cost.  My second visit (also takeout), the food was good again (solid, but nothing stellar, the burger's are a little on the other side of how greasy I will go - but not bad by any means), I took a moment to notice the cost and considered for what I had just paid, I could have gone to the burger place that I prefer and gotten a ridiculous burger with a side for about the same amount.  

The food is good, and I have enjoyed what I have had, but it's nothing that knocks my socks off - they lose 1 star for the price, that seems not too bad a la carte, but rather high for what I am getting once all added up.  It's a neat restaurant with good food, but A-OK after factoring in the price."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place would be great but after eating here several times I am very unimpressed. The food is okay but the service is terrible. The employees here are too busy talking among themselves to take an order and when they finally do, they act like they are doing you a big favor and are rude."}
{"text":"Food was great I must say.... Was a little upset with the stuff. Stood up front for a while before I was greeted. Took me to say I was leaving for them to stop talking to greet me."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about BT's. Went there once it first opened and the burgers are nothing spectacular which I would expect at a restaurant labeled \"burger joint.\" Go across the street to Five Guys which has phenomenal and super fresh burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I had read a few bad reviews but I'm now convinced they must have been written by Five Guys employees. I was extremely pleased that they will cook the burger to the temperate that you want and not what they think is best for you! That's right, if you want a rare burger, you're gonna get one. I am also pleased they serve Coca-cola products.  The burger was juicy and flavorful. They have a nice assortment of toppings to choose from.  I do agree with some other reviews the portion of fries was on the small side given the price. They are however good. I'd probably do the large fries next time. It was fairly crowded when I went and it did take a while for the food to come out but I didn't take note of how long. Maybe it seemed long because I was anxious.  You order your food at the counter and they give you a number to take to your table. They bring the food to you as well as refill your beverages.  Give it a try, you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim today! It is really really good. My husband had bacon  pretzel burger and a chocolate malt. I had a turkey burger with toppings. The fries and tots are very good but the star is the BT Sauce."}
{"text":"Formerly BT's Burger Joint as others have noted over time.

Was in the area today and decided to stop in for lunch at American Burger. American Burger purchased BT's Burger Joint last year but the listing for this restaurant has not chnaged and since others have left their reviews for this restaurant here, I am doing the same.

Walked in a went to the counter. Apparently you order and pay at the counter, take a number and deliver it too your table.  Decided on the Rise 'N Shine Burger which is a standard burger topped with a Fried Egg.  Rather than call it a combo, I did what they called 'Boxed It's which means got it with Fries and a drink which in my case, was sweet tea.

Paid and took my number and started to look for a table. While there are a number of tables inside, most had not been bussed from the last patrons but I did finally manage to find one.

About 10 minutes later my burger arrived in a paper lined basket accompanied by a knife in case I wanted to cut the sandwich. Since everything except the drink was in a paper lined basket, I fail to see why the tables were not bussed since it should have taken less than a minute to dispose of the remains of lunch, spray the table with sanitizing solution and move on.

Started with the fries which while still pretty good, were under cooked and limp. The Burger was messy because of the grease of the burger and kept sliding apart. That's when i discovered that a fork would have been nice but none were to be had. Made for very messy eating.  Picking up a cooked burger patty with my bare hands is not my definition of elegant dining.

Burger was properly cooked but since I was never asked now well I wanted it cooked, I assume there is only one way. That said, properly cooked does not necessarily equate to taste and that was the case here.  Very bland, very little beef flavor and as mentioned before, somewhat  greasy.

Not the best burger and can not give it high marks for either the quality of the food, atmosphere because of issues with messy tables, service because of no utensils.  If these items had been addresses, the price of the burger would have been reasonable but with all of these things put together, it's not a good value."}
{"text":"Finally!  BT's Burger Joint is open in their new Promenade Shopping Center location!  BT's has some of the best burgers available and you decide how you want it dressed!  Not into red meat?  Do not despair... as they have chicken, turkey burgers and garden burgers on the menu too.  AND, you can build your own salad!  Some neat sides to go along like fries, sweet potato fries, tots, and fried pickles!  They also have beer (bottle and on tap) and wine available.

BT's has been a favorite for quite some time, but driving to Rivergate was a bit of a pain.  So, I'm glad to see this new location open!  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time last time

Food was ok but service was NOT GREAT.

the manager on duty was more concerned about coaching an employee than attending to the customers in the store.  We ordered 4 burgers that took 30 minutes which no one else in the restaurant.

I had to go up and get my order because they are all to busy to attend to us

Moral of the story.  Great service can make up for OK food BUT poor service can't over come GREAT food"}
{"text":"Worst overpriced burger I've had it was overdone the fries were lousy and for the wife and I to eat was a big ding in the wallet. Go across the way to five guys better quality bigger portions and you leave smelling like the food nothin better, plus a 105 rating from the health dept. Helps."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to take a day trip to Charlotte and met my brother for a nice Sunday lunch.  We arrived and ordered our food, everything was great until my brother looked at the container his fries came in.  There was ketchup all on the sides and the bottom and he never put ketchup on his plate.   Apparently the dish was never cleaned which was absolutely disgusting.  My son also orderd a milkshake and after waiting 10 minutes for it I went up to check on it, come to find out the order was never put in and after speaking to the manager it took an extra 10 minutes to actually get it.  I was throughly disappointed and will never spend my time or money her again."}
{"text":"BT's has a few good things going for it.  If you are a control freak who likes burgers, you should enjoy this place.  You can build your burger from the ground up to your exact specifications.  I will also give this place credit for being on the sweet potato fry bandwagon before they were available at a lot of places.  The same can be said with the fried pickles.  The burgers themselves are actually really good and of a much better quality than places like Five Guys.  For a while, this was my favorite place for burgers.  It is still on my list as far as the burgers go.  

There are a few not so great things that keep me from going to this place more often than I do.  The service, as you can see in lots of other reviews, is somewhat suspect.  There is also the cleanliness issue.  I think that the staff is pretty laid back in general and this probably doesn't reflect well on the place where you can see everyone who works there as you are waiting for your food.  Additionally, I like a place with some character and this one really doesn't have much.  It is kind of a surfer theme but it is kind of bland and just doesn't really do much for me.

I recommend this place if you want a good burger that beats the other chain stuff."}
{"text":"Poor service. Food is overpriced and they stiff local charities out of money crying broke. Avoid this place it's run by dishonest people.

Never was I contacted. That is OK. Didn't want to \"talk it out\" as they have fund raiser nights for local schools and when we went back to collect for a fund raiser night that had well over 100 - 200 people come in they claimed they could not pay the River Gate ELEM. PTSA and that they were having money issues? Really We bring in almost 200 people and you are having money issues.

The food is overpriced and the staff acts like they are doing you a favor by waiting on you. Won't eat there ever again and it's within 4 miles of my home."}
{"text":"This was a good burger. I really liked the atmosphere and the number of toppings available on the build your own burger menu. It allowed for some nice options. They also give the option of choosing how the burger is cooked which is nice.  I went with Medium and was quite pleased. Still juicy and tasty with fresh, flavorful meat. Nice flavor for the burger, too. The fries were were quite good and all of the staff at the counter were friendly and attentive. The meal was a bit more expensive than I would have imagined but not too bad."}
{"text":"Had lunch this past Friday at 1 pm.  BT's was very busy. We each had cheeseburgers that were done perfectly to our specs. Burgers are juicy and flavorful. Shared an order of fries that I'm a fan of.  Thus far our favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We had lunch each ordered 6 oz. cheeseburgers. They were done perfectly. Great choice of toppings as well.  The burger was juicy and substantial. Fries are nicely done as well. We found the wait/order staff pleasant to deal with. We will try it again."}
{"text":"Cute burger joint near shopping. I took the fan here for dinner one night as they were sponsoring my sons school for a fundraiser.  The inside is reminiscent of an old school malt shoppe, it's cute.  The service is super fast.  You order at the counter and they bring it to you when it's ready.  The kids loved their burgers and I liked that the offerings on the menu were a bit more than just burgers.  They have salads, hotdogs, grilled cheese etc.  I had one of the delicious salads which I thought was like a side salad but no.  It is GIGANTIC!  No disappointment there.  My biggest disappointment was in the turkey burger... There were definitely fillers in the meat :-(. There was no way it was 100% ground turkey in the patty which wS surprising to me.  I mean this isn't mcdonalds!  Perhaps I should go back a try a beef burger but i am not excited about it... On a positive note the prices are very good but I guess when you are filling the turkey meat it should be discounted."}
{"text":"Cashier had trouble ringing in our order. The other guy gave me the wrong beer. The fried pickles were way overpriced and they didn't drain the grease off of them. Fries way too salty. Burgers salty, as if they salted the ground beef.. Not necessary with a Carolina burger. Enough salt in the chili. 5 bucks for a Sam Adams bottle? Sweet tea not sweet at all. Too much money for burgers and fries and a beer. 30 bucks! Won't go back for meh food. Also, one worker told me she would bring me a to-go box and never returned. Pretty crappy customer service."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new burger place as opposed to the usual Bad Daddy's. BT\"s is located where Wolfgang Puck and that pizza place that lasted 6 months were. Upon entering, the place seemed much smaller than I remembered. The decor wasn't bad--it felt as if I was about go so surfing or something.

Ordering is the typical order it at the counter and they bring it to you style. Ordering was easy enough--I got a 6 ounce burger cooked medium rare with honey mustard. After about 20 minutes, the burger finally came out, and it was cooked medium-well. If it was medium I would have been fine, but it went back. Literally a minute later a new burger came out which was cooked somewhat better. The honey mustard had no taste. I had to resort to putting ketchup on it. Oh well, empty calories. The burger itself wasn't bad at all--it is between a fast food burger and a gourmet burger. 

Service was fine. With the little interaction we had, I thought they did a fine job. Would I go back? Maybe. It may be worth another shot, but really, I could always go to Bad Daddy's or Five Guys."}
{"text":"Do people actually like this crap?! This is the first \"regular\" hamburger that I've had in years. I always go for places that serve high quality grass fed beef and I had a weird craving tonight and thought I would be splurging by going to a greasy hamburger joint. Not so. This thing had no real beef flavor and the bun was even disgusting. I'm happy to find that I am not missing anything with this junk that most people eat.  Seriously people,  you may think Bad Daddy's or Cowfish is expensive for a burger but there is good reason why.  If you're going to eat a burger it should be good quality out or on your own grill at home."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and awesome shakes, came here a few times, never had bad food. The price is reasonable, and the staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious, we have never had a bad experience. The fries are crispy and the portions are nice--we usually end up thinking we should have gotten only 1 order to share because we always have so many left over. The chef is extremely nice and accommodating. I ordered the philly cheesesteak last time (Yum!) and I don't like sautéed veggies so she went out of her way to find fresh veggies to chop up for my sandwich. I appreciate awesome customer service! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great sandwich and a smiling face behind the counter."}
{"text":"Decor is cute, service and attention to customers is excellent. Burgers and hot dogs were so so. Burgers were overdone and under seasoned. I don't know why they serve their burgers and hot dogs on cold buns. The hot dogs looked boiled so they were pasty and unappetizing. I would think they would grill them. But once again, customer service was fantastic. We felt very well taken care of."}
{"text":"Love the burgers. Similar to any other build your own burger type place. The sweet potato fries with cinnamon butter are stellar. Service could be a little better but overall yummy goodness."}
{"text":"The overall experience was subpar. No greeting or direction on where to order when we entered. The burgers were cooked a little rarer than our tastes. The food in general was just average. Not much flavor. Smash Burger down the street is much better. And there's no need to make a comparison with 5 Guys. I don't see this place lasting long. The operation doesn't seem to be run smoothly either."}

{"text":"Tried this Promenade Joint again..Once more it was outstanding..Ice Cold Craft Beers...Perfectly cooked ( Medium rare) Burger with Avocado and Provolone Cheese.Their Sweet Potato Fries ..crispy and sweet! Quickly waited on..and served..they have it down...Can't recommend this place enough..Finally a great little place in this space!!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. Burger (6oz) fries and soda over 10 bucks. The fries were 2.40... And not for a five guys portion either! 
. Service was slow too... And the place was not packed out. I predict they will not last long.... Like johnnie brusco's."}
{"text":"Best Damned burgers ANYWHERE! Great clean open atmosphere inside and on the patio. Great friendly staff too. I made the wall of fame by eating the \"40in 20\"- That's a 40 oz burger ( 5 burger patties with cheese on a bun ) in 20 minutes! I did it in just under 15 mins. It's free if you do it within 20 mins or it's $15.99 if you can't do it. I really wanted to eat slower because it was DELICIOUS, but it's a contest... I don't want to do that again I want to eat ( a regular size burger ) slowly and enjoy the yummyness.   Mmmmm I love this place! Try the sweet potato fries too! ( with honey butter drizzled on em )."}
{"text":"Terrific, family-friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had (hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those), but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!"}
{"text":"BT's has been one of my favorite burger joints for a while now.  I go regularly when I get back home to the Charlotte area.  Had dinner there tonight...

I had the Carolina Burger...nice beefy burger patty with chili, slaw and mustard...yummy.  Along with that, I got the Fries with some ranch dressing...again it was just very good.  The food here is very consistent...I have had this same meal many times and it is always about the same!

The service can be a bit spotty.  Tonight, the burger took a while to come out...this is what stops them from getting a full five stars.

Like a couple of other folks here, I do not reallly get the animosity shown to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited over 20min for two burgers and tots-my tots came out cold and neither my burger nor my husbands were made as we ordered them.
I ordered a water and never received it. The tables around us sat down after we did and they received their food before us.
One upside to this place is that they have outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"2nd visit, better.  But it was not busy, no one in line and only a few customers already inside.  Fries are still overpriced - but burger (normal) was good, no complaints. 

Still nothing special so far."}
{"text":"Definitely not for us....Fries and onion rings were greasy. The onion rings were like the cheapest ones from the grocery store. The hot dog was blackened. With two kids meals and one hamburger and one hot dog and a small order of onion rings which was 6 onion rings (since they wouldn't substitute a few rings for fires) the bill was $32.We definitely have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Quality of the food is very low. Frozen beef patties, buns, fries and onion rings. Today's burger market you need something to set you apart, and American burger company or BT's what ever it's called doesn't have it. And for the price ($30 for two burgers fries and drinks) your money is better spent at your favorite fast food joint."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Place is filthy. Took my hot dog back because I asked for no mustard 3 times, I still got mustard. Everyone was finished with their food when I finally went back up to check on the hot dog progress....guess what, they forgot....will not return for sure."}
{"text":"To sum it up, you get fast food burgers for twice the price. I ordered a burger and fries for lunch and the burger was poor quality meat and overlooked, the fries were okay. Honestly Wendy's and Burger King make much better burgers. There are plenty of other burger places nearby with much better food. I would skip this one."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and wish the food was better!

The first time we went my burger was undercooked and missing the avocado I ordered. The second time we went I ordered my burger well done and thankfully that's how it came. However I had thought my poor experience the first time was due to my unease with the pink center. The second experience was just as lackluster with the burner cooked as ordered. The burgers just don't have anything to recommend them.

The service here has always been prompt and friendly which is why the food quality is such a shame."}
{"text":"My family of 4 visited BT's on a Saturday night.  We arrived to a line out the door @ approximately 6:00 so we were pleasantly surprised to find open tables to sit at.  We waited in the order line for less than 10 minutes and the process was pretty easy.   We ordered 4 burgers, fried pickles (appetizer) and small orders of tater tots, fries, and sweet potato fries as the burger sides.   

It was a warm night so we ate outside.  The patio is a nice size and the servers were attentive so we didn't fell forgotten since we were outside.  The Fried Pickles came out within a few minutes.  They looked great, but were so salty that none of us could eat them.  The server took them back and removed the charge from our bill.

Approximately 15 minutes after placing our order, the burgers and sides arrived.  They all looked great and were piping hot.  Everyone in my party had standard cold condiments on their burgers, but I had grilled onions and mushrooms and they were just 'ok'.   A tad greasy and not seasoned well enough.  Not terrible, but not crave-worthy either.  Everyone enjoyed their burgers and sides, but all of us agreed that everything (except for the pickles) were greatly under-seasoned and that the Tater Tots were too greasy.  Yes, I know...they are fried in grease, but...they were on the edge of being inedible because they were so greasy.  

The ordering process was easy, the service was good, and the prices are quite decent.  With all of the taken into consideration, we might try it again to see if maybe we just caught it on an off night.  This will not be our first choice for a quick service burger (that, of course, is Five Guys), but if we are in the area and craving a burger, we might stop back in.   If we do...and it's better...I will be happy to revise my rating.  But for now, it's only a 3-star in our book.

On a positive note...It was nice to be able to order a burger medium-well and have it actually come out medium-well and not well done!"}
{"text":"Absolute best burgers!!  You can tell the burgers are hand-patted and they are huge.  I have yet to eat an entire burger.  The fries are awesome and their \"special sauce\" is good on everything.  This is definitely our go to place for a good burger."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome here! It's cool how you can basically create your own burger with toppings you'd like. I went with a grilled chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint! The fries are also pretty good here compared to most. I recommend everyone to go to bt's!"}
{"text":"i went here for my first time today and i guess i thought it was gonna be more than what it was. i was kinda disappointed that it was just a high priced 5 guys, mind you 5 guys is across the street and its where i was going to originally go. i do like the fact that everything is made to order but i felt like my burger was kinda small and my fries were burnt. not to mention nothing comes as a meal in this place so my hubby and i spent $21 on two burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 drinks. the tables were not that clean, and if you have read my reviews before i can't stand going in places with nasty bathrooms. it really bothers me when i go into a nasty bathroom in a restaurant because that means the employees don't care which probably means they don't wash their hands, and it makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like.."}
{"text":"Went to BT's on National Cheeseburger day so the marketing worked on me and the large crowd on a Friday night. They had music in the square outside so the patio was very busy and so was the line waiting to order and eat inside or get burgers to go (which is the route I went). There were multiple registers open and the line moved quickly. 

The menu has changed to the American Burger Co menu with some of the best sellers from BT's mixed in. I ordered the route 66 burger which has an onion ring on it and pepper jack cheese. I opted for no BBQ sauce since I was getting it to go and I like ketchup better anyway. I also order a NODA Hop Drop which was one of several major and craft brew options. By the time my beer was finished my order was ready which was awesome timing. 

Got onion rings and sweet potato fries and they were awesome. My bride had the California Burger made with turkey, you can customize any burger, and she loved it. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were very good."}
{"text":"For those with short attention spans - the quick review: good burgers, bad sides, bill too high. If you have to have a beer with your burger, then stay. Otherwise don't.

OK, still with me? On to the details, I got a pretzel bacon cheese burger. And it was pretty damn good. $8.  I also got a plate of 1/2 onion rings and 1/2 fires. This was a complete WTF.....the onion rings were over breaded and over cooked. terrible would be an upgrade from what these were. The fires - I swear to god not one fry was 2 inches long. not one!  That 1/2 n 1/2 cost me $5.70. The fountain drink was a 20 oz cup. which you could refill but this small cup wasnt even worth taking a refill on the road.  So all that for $17. SEVENTEEN dollars for that? really? 

So like I said, the only real reason you would be here and not at a Hardy's or a Wendy's is because you want a beer with your burger. But skip the sides."}
{"text":"Food is good but SO overpriced. Just took them 40 minutes to get us our food! People that ordered after us got there's within 15 mins! Bad service."}
{"text":"My second visit here hamburg is ok  my fries probable fry twice feel grease and old . I went 3pm no rush hour. I don't recommend"}
{"text":"I was hoping for more because I live close by but just an average burger. The burger for med well was more medium cooked. They forgot my pimento cheese on the burger so had to wait and flag someone from the kitchen to get it, they did very quickly and were nice. I built my own with pimento cheese, bacon,onion straws and ranch. The bacon was rubbery not crispy at all, I ended up taking it off the burger. The onion straws were good but also could have been crispier. Tater tots were good, exactly what anyone would expect. Overall just eh and probably will not return for the price. I will say the staff was really nice overall."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars for this reason. They burger itself is good. Tasty beef but for the cost it's over priced. I paid over $12 for a burger, fries, and a soda. The food took about 15 min to get out to me, so I wasn't amazed by the speed but it could be a little quicker since I was the last one to eat before closing. I arrived 25 min before they closed, they locked the door 10 min before closing and I couldn't enjoy my meal with out hearing all of the clanking noises of the staff closing."}
{"text":"This is a walk up and order and they bring it to you kind of place. We both ordered hamburgers. The buns were cold and very \"weak\", it fell apart half way through. The basic items a customer might need are only available by going to the counter and asking for it. This includes napkins, salt, pepper, forks, refills, etc. They are running around at the counter so they might not get things to you quickly. Overall not too happy. There are certainly other more customer friendly hamburger joints."}
{"text":"Now American Burger Co, the service has went down hill. We ordered an appetizer, which I asked to come out before the meal, and it came with the meal. The restaurant was almost empty, and the food took a long time to come out. 

Food was ok, but service was bad. No one came to refill drinks like they did when it was BT. So far, disappointed in the change. No plans to go back to this location."}
{"text":"We are relatively new to the area and wanted to know where we could get a good burger.  We jumped on Yelp and since there happens to be a BT's across the street from us we thought we'd try it out.  We really enjoyed everything, from the service to the food, to the cleanliness and atmosphere.  Definitely a thumbs up!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat burgers but the burgers here were awesome. My favorite burger is the normal with american cheese with both fries and onion rings. It's great to eat outside too."}
{"text":"Although BT's has been in Rivergate for some time, we had dinner here for the first time recently.  My husband was in heaven since he created his own burger with toppings.  It can get pricey but that's the luxury of being allowed to get exactly what you want.

I actually had the kids meal grilled cheese, so I can't say much for the rest but I am definitely going to try the build your own salad option so I can have it exactly how I want it.  The fries were good, nothing great but nothing bad I can remember about them.  

The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant.  We'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Don't give out 5's to many, but this burger joint deserves the rating.  Burgers all cooked to your liking and toppings No extra charge(except avocado).  They also have turkey burgers and garden burgers. grilled chicken,  grilled cheese, and kosher hot dogs can be done to your specs , too! 
Had the fries which are fresh cut and not greasy! Yummy!

Great for a date or the family. Have TVs with sports. Beer and wine available."}
{"text":"We ate there Wednesday night and place was not crowded.  Service was fast and polite. It was first time in a BT Joint and the food tasted pretty good. Better then Burger King or McD. I had a burger and she had turkey burger, all went well.  The place looked pretty clean. It was a short trip for us and would return."}
{"text":"Yes, another burger place, but what sets this apart is the attention to detail.  Service was spot on.  For the other reviews to say it was slow, just remember this ISN'T 5 Guys or McDonalds.  I would say the closest competitor would be The Counter in California and NYC and they blow it away!  Everything is made to order and it is all tasty.  It takes time to make perfection, and it is worth your time investment.  

I got the Turkey Burger, Carolina Style but with Blue Cheese and it was phenomenal.  It was probably one of the best Turkey Burgers I had.  I spoke to the GM and he told me the reason is they are never frozen and all the seasonings and patty building is done on premises.  The only way they could be fresher is if there was a turkey pen behind the restaurant.  I looked to make sure.  There was only a Home Depot.

Fries were awesome.  They are definitely quality over quantity.  While half the size of 5 Guys, you don't feel like you drank 5 gallons of grease when you're done.  They beat The Counter hands down too.

To top it all off, the selection of beer rivals some liquor stores I've been in.  I had a Banana Bread Beer, which really had hints of banana in it.  Very Tasty.

Overall, with all the Burger Joints around, BT's stands out due to the food quality, beer selection and as quick as it can be service.  You must go."}
{"text":"They're not bad but they're not that great either. IMHO, I think Five Burgers has better better meat. It's nice that you have more interesting options to put on your burger but the burger could be more flavorful. 
And I prefer my meat to be piping hot, but BT's doesn't do it like that. Maybe it's because I requested mine to be med-rare? 
Overall, I would go here when I crave for egg on my burger or if there's no Five Burgers around.
ALSO, they serve beers and milkshakes so that's a bonus :)"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and atmosphere.  Wish the fries serving was more plentiful... like Five Guys.

Fried pickles also delicious.  Staff is exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to spend more money for a Five Guys quality burger?

The atmosphere is sort of surfer, Hawaiian burger shoppe, that's kinda douchey, but also kind of works.  The burgers are ok, but nothing special.  The real surprise is the price, which is quite a bit higher than a Five Guys competitor.

Two adult burgers, one kids meal, two orders of fries = $26?  give me a break!  The price, unfortunately, makes BT's a less than good value option for dinner or lunch.

You're better off spending $20 for similar quality and larger quantity at Five Guys or Smash Burger."}
{"text":"The key here is \"handmade\" - hand pattied burgers, hand cut fries and hand made milkshakes. Everything is made to order.

I was in a burger mood and BT's hit the spot. The 8 ounce burger was made of very tasty beef topped with my choice of toppings (I went with pepperjack cheese and bacon plus \"free\" toppings sauteed mushrooms, onions and lettuce, skipping the chili, jalapenos, pickles and relish) and a small fries. The food was brought out to my table quickly, where I was enjoyed one of their draft beer selections (Yuengling for $2.50!) The small fries were hot and there would be enough to share. (I missed that they also have sweet potato fries. Dang!)

I opted not to go for the milkshake, but other people in the place were enjoying theirs. If there wasn't a Cold Stone Creamery right next door, I'd say that coming in just for the shake looks like fun.

Music playing softly in the background, plus two flatscreen TV's tuned in to ESPN. 

BT's also has chicken and salad offerings, as well as kid's meals. Check the website for the complete list.

Summary: Enjoyable burger in a comfortable inexpensive restaurant. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great burger and friendly people. There is a good sized deck that lets you take your time and enjoy lunch before having to go back to work. The fires/tots combination is a great fit. The only thing I won't try is the 40/20. 40 ounces of hamburger in 20 minutes in order to get your picture on their wall. Good job BT!"}
{"text":"BT's is fantastic. The food is fresh, the people are nice, service is great. The burger is everything you could want in a burger and then add the tots and you've got a great meal. The outside seating gives you a chance to enjoy the fall weather. We needed someplace like BT's to compete in this market and I'm glad they're here."}
{"text":"The burgers are decent, but to be honest I prefer Five Guys across the street. However I do love that you can get pimento cheese on your burger and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"BT's burger joint is great! the price is appropriate for the quality of the food, the service is friendly and works hard and fast, and the environment is great. I highly recommend the shakes and bacon cheeseburger. I will definitely be coming back for more, hoping this restaurant stays around for awhile."}
{"text":"Ok, can we get w/the times and offer a freakin' turkey burger??  I don't eat red meat (well, verrry rarely), so this place is pretty much off my radar.  We popped in here a while back since we were out shopping in the Rivergate area & thought it look cool & local.  So first the atmosphere: I just don't like the whole thing of standing in line, order & pay at a register, get a number on a stick, take that to your table & then wait for the waiter/waitress to bring it to you. Just not my thing - very \"fast food-esque\" in a seudo-restaurant atmosphere.  I have my exceptions, but I think this place just put a bad taste in my mouth.

Now the food:  Ended up getting a chicken sandwich since all they had were traditional beef burgers.  I was shocked at how SMALL it was for, if I'm remembering correctly, $7.
Partner got a burger & it was pretty small as well.  I dunno, maybe I'm just picky, but for a burger JOINT, I'd think that they'd be pretty sizable...on par with TGIFriday's or Ruby Tuesday's at least.   

Just for my little sandwich, a side of sweet potato fries and a tea I paid somewhere around $12 or $13...are you kidding me?  

Would we go back - hell no.  I can get a much bigger, better, tastier sandwich/burger/meal (and value) in New York City for God's sake (Park Cafe' for instance), not to mention elsewhere in Charlotte.  Sorry - this place just irritated me.  Way to overpriced for what you get, so if you're thinking of taking a family, I say beware!

Ok Yelpers, after all this burger talk I'm hungry, so I'm off to Ruby's to get my TURKEY Avocado burger! hehe :)"}
{"text":"This place has more than just burgers.  There are sandwiches, hot dogs and salads on the menu and your choice of fries, tots and more as your side item.  

For burgers, they have beef options but also have Turkey and Chicken and customized to your liking with standard fixins and some that you wouldn't expect.  I opted for the Turkey burger with swiss cheese, mustard/ketchup, lettuce, tomato and onions.  Nothing too fancy.  The burger was big and hardly fit the bun.  The toppings were fresh and unlike some places, they do not use iceburg lettuce (this is a plus!).  But the burger itself was a little salty.

The fries were good and were not overly salted like some places do.  

The place also offers hand spun shakes and quite a variety of beer both in tap and bottle form.  There's a beer menu at your table.  But although there were a few craft beer options, I found it odd that a locally based chain did not have a single local beer on the menu.  Sad.

One other thing here is service.  You order at the counter.  When I got there there was 8 people in line and only one person taking orders and two girls right behind the counter standing around doing nothing.  They didn't open the other register until the line went down to 3.  And the 10 minutes they said it would take for my order to be out turned out to be 25.  

Still this is a decent place and could be worth another trip to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"I liked it! I was passing by after picking up some supplies at Home Depot about 2:00 pm. The place had about 10 patrons so I knew I wouldn't have to wait. 
Walked right up to the counter where I was greeted politely. 
Now, I'm not much on building my own burger, I usually go for the specialty burgers in a burger joint so I chose the burger that comes with an egg on top, I believe it's called \"sunny side up\"...over easy is the way I had it cooked, meat: medium.
I also ordered fries and drank water......9 bucks or so.
Sat outside as it was a nice day.
Didn't wait too long maybe 10 mins and there it was, hot, cooked perfectly, delicious. Fries were hot and delish as well.
Someone in a previous review said 5 guys had better meat......I beg to differ. 
Unlike five guys this sandwich was much easier to eat, even with an over easy egg on it.
I do feel they could give you a larger portion of fries for the money, this is why the four stars. 
I hope they make it there.....Wolfgang didn't."}
{"text":"Amazing food, what you'd expect from a burger joint. Staff was super friendly and we had a good time. Try to come during off hours to avoid crowds!"}
