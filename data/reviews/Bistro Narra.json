{"text":"Had a great meal here on the weekend for their schnitzel fest. I made reservations but they weren't required as there were a few empty seats when we arrived at 7:30.  Bistro Narra seems to do specialty menus every so often, which is great for additional variety. This time it was schnitzel fest. I tried the cordon bleu and it was very easy for me to sub out french fries and sub in parsley potatoes instead.   When the meal came, it was a tad over-cooked (fried too long), but still delicious. Didn't order dessert this time, but I usually do and it is always good.   Service was great, quick, and friendly. The chef came out to say hello and our service was very attentive. I couldn't believe how quickly our meals came out.   I like the decor of this restaurant, it's fresh, modern, and clean.   The regular menu seems to change a bit. Which is good for the variety, but bad if you find something you really enjoy and then it disappears (like the corn soup, which was one of the best soups I've ever had and is now gone :( )."}
{"text":"Update: Had the steak frites here recently. The best steak frites I have had in a long time! And I like steak well done, which is not always the easiest in terms of making sure it's soft and tender. The head chef here knows what he is doing, and does it extremely well. Had strudel for dessert too which was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Delicious food, great service, and a chef who comes by your table to personally make sure you are happy. Lamb was cooked perfectly and has become my favourite place to get it."}
{"text":"Was there for my sons birthday dinner. We all loved it. Great service, good food, good wine and good prices. Will be visiting again"}
{"text":"Nice meal enjoyed.  Good price for $25 had 3 courses.  Attentive wait staff and nicely presented plates.  Great dessert selections too. Would go back. Just don't sit near the door ... very drafty."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just had dinner tonight at Bistro Narra. The complimentary bread and everything we ordered -- calamari appetizer, t-bone steak, rack of lamb -- was absolutely delicious. The chef/owner even came out to personally bring our dessert (a slice of pecan pie with vanilla ice cream) to our table.  A nice, personal touch! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my parents. It was delicious. Only issue I had is that there was a mistake on the menu - the pasta includes chicken already, and has an \"add steak\" option. Perhaps it should be fixed to avoid confusion. Otherwise, service was great and so was the food!   I got the mushroom salad to start (amazing), and steak with roasted veggies for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his brother. It's Alot fancier than we expected, we felt a little under dressed in jeans. The service was great, food was mediocre, far from amazing. I'm a vegetarian and I felt I was really limited. I ended up having mashed potatoes and veggies. The veggies were overcooked and mashed was chunky. I also had a bowl of the daily soup which I believe was red pepper, I ate it cause I was hungry but didn't really enjoy it. It had a garnish of what seemed like tempura red peppers but it was really nasty.  My boyfriend and his brother enjoyed theirs more than I did but wasn't worth the 28$ each meal cost. It all felt slightly pretentious but didn't live up to what it was attempting to be. We all found our food dry, whether it was my mash which could've used some milk and butter, my boyfriends steak which was lacking in sauce and overcooked, or our mousse and tiramasu (sp?) desserts which were both a bit floury. My mousse also wasn't set in the very Center.  Overall, it wasn't horrendous, and our server was great, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend and we absolutely loved it-- the food, the atmosphere and the service we received.   Unfortunately it wasn't very busy when we arrived. Most likely because it was already 2:30pm when we arrived. Weekend brunch is served until 3pm so we got there just in time :)  My boyfriend ordered the Narra Florentine and I got the Narra's breakfast. The florentine actually had regular Atlantic salmon instead of the usual smoked salmon. Which was nice. Both of our orders were perfectly portioned. I ordered my dish with the 2 course option, where coffee and a cake slice is included. This option is $14 which is a steal for the quality of food served. My boyfriend ordered his meal without the 2 course option so it was only $9. Great value!  For the cake slice they had a variety to choose from. I chose the apple streudal and it was delicious. The portion size was very generous, definitely enough for me and my boyfriend to share.   The service was very good. Our server was very friendly and professional. I seldom get the urge to tip servers more than 15% but I definitely did not hesitate tipping extra :)  Overall I think Bistro Narra is a great brunch spot. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! I had the German breakfast which was to die for! My hubby had the egfs benedict which were also very good.  Great coffee and service, impecable! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and entrees were nice. We ordered salmon filet, and seafood linguini. The reasons this isn't getting a 5 star rating is because a) it was odd that they had no other drinks on the menu other than alcohol and water; b) our server was sweet, but the service wasn't that good - there were times when she completely forgot about us, and we had to get up to remind her; c) we ordered the soufflé which was heavily undercooked. This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal."}
{"text":"Bistro Narra has a modern feel,but comfortable. Service was great, they where attentive , pleasent and informative. I had the mussels as an app very nice.  The beef medallions ( feature ) as my main. If it was appropriate to lick your plate in public I would have. AMAZING I also tried a delicious dessert one of many on the menu. The chef randomly came out of the kitchen and asked if i enjoyed the food .He was so nice and professional. It is so rare to get chefs out of a kitchen these days.  I'm planning my next visit to this Mississauga gem."}
{"text":"Really a fabulous brunch! Eggs Benedict done with class! Reasonable prices but with high quality touches!  3 course meals are all very excellent!  A gem of a place!  Brunch, lunch or dinner. All good!"}
{"text":"Food was alright but it's quite pricey. Service was good and the place is pretty cozy."}
{"text":"Just came here for a Saturday brunch with a friend at around 11am. We made reservations beforehand assuming it would be busy, but it wasn't too bad! I ordered the Narra Florentine, which was delicious!! The egg was perfectly cooked, salmon was fresh and potatoes on the side were a little crispy and not too greasy. My friend had a Chicken Caesar Wrap with fries which she really enjoyed as well. We shared a Dark Chocolate Mousse cake for dessert and we loved it - it was the perfect consistency and sweetness!  The overall ambiance of the place was a great place for conversation, not too quiet but not loud either. We stayed for almost 3 hours and they didn't rush us out at all - our waitress was very friendly! Also, I used a groupon for payment but just a heads up, it doesn't work with the 2-course brunch option ($14), so the items will be charged separately. Not a huge deal, because you still save some money anyways.   I will definitely be returning here!!"}
{"text":"Food: Tapsilog: the beef was too salty and the portion was pretty small Seafood Crepe: delicious but again a bit small Raspberry Cake: way too sour   Service was friendly but super slow. We stood for 5 minutes before being seated. And it took over 30 minutes for our foods to come."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Mississauga.  The food is delicious (I am picky so this is a big deal). The ambiance is nice and unpretentious. Service is great Prices are decent, no need to break the bank  They have tons of multiple course specials AND if you join their mailing list they will give you a free birthday dinner.  5 stars for these guys......"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with my friend. I had never been here before but absolutely loved it. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. I had a mochaccino with a dessert that tastes really good. The chef brought it right to our table which was a nice touch. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"From the same makers of The Apricot Tree (enjoy their desserts).   I Took my mom here for her birthday on a weekday during lunch. We were the first customers. Ordered the escargot (bland, buttery, not in shell - wish it had more garlic and herb).  I seriously cannot remember what else we ate. Nothing seemed to leave a lasting impression. Nothing was bad though.   Maybe will try to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"The interior of Narra Bistro is really nice but there is almost lack of colour I thought it would have a little more pop.But the food is excellent and the service is great. The 2 course meal for lunch and breakfast is worth the extra scratch because it comes with coffee and dessert defiantly do consider."}
{"text":"Service : okay.. A bit slow for what it's worth. Came on a Saturday night with no reservation. I came with one person, and there were 2 group of six people already seated.   Food : ordered the shrimp and mussels in tarragon white wine sauce ($21) and slow braised short rib crepe ($16). I wasn't expecting the crepe to have a Tex-mex chili as their sauce, especially from a place like bistro Narra. The seafood dish came with bow tie pasta and some sautéed onion. A little on the bland side.  We also ordered their crab cake, but it never came and wasn't on the bill either. So I can assume they didn't put the order in.  Bouchee of prosciutto wrapped melon came with toasted bread and butter. Bread was soft but a bit dry. Main entrees took some time to arrive, even though the two other groups had already had their food.   Overall, the wait staff was very pleasant, but I probably would not return with the new management. Would rather go back to the apricot tree."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had a seafood crepe. Really good but a bit pricey. Definitely worth it though if you need a nice place to catch up with a friend!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Mississauga. I didn't know this place was in the Starbucks/Wings Up plaza that I drive by weekly. I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend brought me here.   I had the crab cakes and Narra Schnitzel. Both were fantastic! The fresh homemade bread they serve is also amazing. We got 3 baskets of bread because it was so good! The server was not cheap and told us not to be shy if we wanted more bread.  While our server was very nice, there were times we would be sitting there waiting for him, like when we were ready to order.  The atmosphere was nice - on the fancier side but dinner pricing isn't high. It's good for dates and groups. We even saw some families with kids too. I am definitely going to be coming back here. I would love to give the brunch a try."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. The portion was really big. The service was great. We were in a rush so they served our food really quick and brought us the dessert to go without us even having to ask. The restaurant looks nice too."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My fiance and I visited this place during their lobster fest and although it was a little pricey, the lobster crepe was totally worth it! We also ordered a quinoa with chicken dish that wasn't that great and an lobster dip appetizer that was okay. Their bread were delicious! We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A surprisingly upscale restaurant tucked in a shopping plaza in Mississauga.  The place is beautifully decorated, spare and modern, but comfortable.  Service was excellent. Water was refilled often, the meals came out at around the same time and found their way to the correct person without our assistance and was polite and professional.  The meals were very good. I had the tilapia special which came grilled on white asparagus and potatoes. At first I was worried about the size of the dish, but it was just enough to fill me up. I also had the French onion soup (without cheese) as an appetizer, which was pretty good. But without cheese, it's just not the same. My main was very tasty. Everyone else at the table also really enjoyed their meals. Apparently the lobster crepe was very good (it's lobster fest right now).  The prices were fair, ranging from $17-$30 for entrees.   I'd say that this is a good date restaurant."}
{"text":"Like it more than Cora's! Cora's portion sizes have shrunk but prices have gone up. This place is good food for good value. $14 gets you an entree, a big slice of good quality cake (which you'll probably have to doggy bag after your meal because you'll be stuffed) and a good coffee (free refills). Too bad there wasnt a lot of traffic - more people should be coming here! Ambiance is nice. We had a nice lunch date here."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group. The food was amazing. Loved the mushroom salad. The staff was really nice and accommodating for such a big group. Thank you for making it such a great night! :)"}
{"text":"boyfriend had the duck dish, extremely small portion... 3 slices of duck meat on rice ( they really need to work on the rice cooking skill)  I had pork schnitzel but it was very dry and cardboard like....  2 stars for the atmosphere, 1 star for the food..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Norwegian crepe, Narra Benedict and their coffee! All very delicious!!  The menu had good choices and the restaurant/ bathrooms were very clean! Seating was very conmfoetable and it wasn't too dark or loud! The service was great, server was very friendly, quick and helpful. My only reservation  about this place was that I found lipstick stains on my water glass when I was not wearing any that day. Would suggest servers to double check for clean glasses before serving! Other than that, I look forward to checking out their large cake selection next time!"}
{"text":"Nice food, nice ambience but our meal was ruined ny the poor service, it took 50 minutes for our food to come. The servers seemed like untrained high school students and none of them attempted to explain why it was taking so long. We ordered the Narra breakfast and the seafood crepe ~ both were good but nothing too extra-ordinary. Disappointed."}
{"text":"FUNDAYSUNDAY   Best brunch deal so far. \"2-COURSE $14 Choice of any of the following dishes and served with cake slice. Includes coffee.\"  Can it get any better? They have so many dessert options!  TIPS:  -MAKE RESERVATIONS. -Go early so you can call dibs on your slice (I was lucky enough to snag the last slice of napoleon cake.) -expect a nice long brunch  The establishment fits around 40 seats (they'll squish a third seat into a 2 person table if they have to). It's clean and modern.   Waitresses are so nice but they definitely need to hire another set of hands or train for a better operation because service was slow. I made reservations and I still had to wait 15 minutes to clear the table.  Oh and of course the food was delicious.  I'll be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Surprising to find such a lovely restaurant in this tiny plaza.  However, the food and the service is excellent and the desserts are amazing.  I have clients close by and love to give gift certificates to them to enjoy a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bistro Narra for lunch and brunch a few different times.   The food is normally very good but it's not the first thing that comes to mind.   It's the really spotty and slow service that more time than not left which ever group I was with frustrated and judging my selection of restaurant :/  Asking for anything generally doesn't show up til near the end of the meal.   Their 2 or 3 course combo is a great deal. Wish they had better coffee.  Like their selection of food which includes European flair, brunch and crepes and delicious cakes!  Intimate decor and less than 15 tables."}
{"text":"I purchased a couple of Bistro Narra vouchers on a whim when I saw them on Groupon. At such a discount, I did not have high expectations, especially when pulling up to the restaurant and seeing it was bordered by a Rexall's and a Starbucks. When I entered, I was totally caught by surprise. Bistro Narra was a fairly upscale restaurant.  Don't let the exterior fool you, because you'll feel like you're in a totally different place the moment you step in. The interior had a very clean white theme. Once I got over the fact that I was awfully underdressed, I was excited at the prospect that I'd likely be treated to some amazing food. I ordered the Lobster Crepes for my entrée, absolutely delicious. They didn't skimp out on the lobster content either - the lobster taste was prominent throughout. It was accompanied by a leafy green salad.   In a good way, Bistro Narra was probably my biggest surprise in my many years of dining. Both the food and the service was nothing less than a perfect 10."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding down this time - but I would be open to returning.   I ordered 2 appetizers instead of a main: eggplant parm and crab cakes. Both servings were larger than expected (especially the parm) but just alright in taste.  My husband had the lobster crepe - I had a bite and it was delicious thanks to the flavourful mascarpone cheese cream sauce.   There was a live jazz musician, which made for a nice ambience except that given the small size of the restaurant, the music was a bit too loud for conversation.   Service was attentive, but I wish the server had mentioned the specials. After ordering, I realized there was a specials board on the far side - I likely would have ordered one of them had I been advised.    2 apps + 1 main + 1 soft drink came to $50 before tip."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with this restaurant. I went with a group of friends. Most had the set menu. It was blah. Small portions. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The decor was surprising to me. For some reason, I thought it was a romantic restaurant. But it's not. It's really average."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious meal with a quiet and casual ambiance -- this is your spot. My dear friends chose this spot for a catch up brunch and I was pleasantly surprised as it was the perfect place for us to enjoy some good food and chat for hours.   They have lunch specials where you can choose a drink (coffee or tea), entree AND a slice of cake for a fixed price ($19)-- such an amazing deal. I had the tapsilog (I guess there's some Filipino influence in their dishes) and the steak was juicy and not over done. Presentation of all our entrees were on point and portion was just the right amount.   Service was great. Our waitress attended to our neediness and refilled our coffee, tea and water frequently although we had to ask a couple times. My friends and I stayed for quite awhile just chatting and catching up and nobody ever rushed us out by bringing the bill even though they were setting up their tables for lunch.   The decor is very clean and modern and doesn't feel like they're trying too hard. They have a pretty good variety of brunch and lunch menu items and I will definitely be back next time I need to have a nice catch up sesh with my friends in the area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice upscale dining hidden away in a strip mall with a Rexall. Make sure you also check out the specials board."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day dinner. With our family of 5 adults, 3 kids, 1 toddler, they were very accommodating. Food was tasty and similar to Apricot Tree. Good salads, good french onion soup, and reasonable sized mains. There is room for dessert and I would definitely recommend their desserts.  They are made like the ones at Apricot Tree.  If you are looking for large portions at a low price, this is not the place for you.  But if you want to enjoy a nice meal in a nice setting with good service, then highly recommended.  By the way, there is no wifi, but the Starbucks wifi is close enough."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Gd food at a affordable price. Esp wkend brunch, they have 2-courses meals that incl coffee n dessert at ard $20."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants that's close by. Can't go wrong with their pastas, lamb and chicken. The set menu specials are mostly good food.  Did not care too much about the mussels tonight. The lamb shank was juicy and good."}
{"text":"Late night dinner with a friend - I had the crab cakes and Caesar salad.    I've been here twice now, and I find they really oversalt their greens.  Portion sizes are adequate, and service is very professional."}
{"text":"3.5*. Not bad, Mississauga! I've been searching for a good brunch spot in the west end of the GTA that takes reservations (you'd be surprised how many don't), and overall, this place delivered on what I was looking for: they take reservations, they have a decent variety to their menu, and they're reasonably priced. So if you need to reserve tables for brunch (big group brunch dates... are a new thing), or you just feel like ensuring you have a table when you arrive (versus the long brunch waits so common in other parts of Toronto), this place isn't a bad idea.  First, ambiance. Honestly, the environment was a bit weird to me at the beginning but it grew on me - it felt super upscale, nice tablecloths, almost-fancy (but not quite) decor, etc. It's definitely not the Queen West-hipster brunch vibe, but it grows on you - and overall, this restaurant is quite nice.  Second, the food. We ordered the a) Narra Benedict ($9.00), and b) English Breakfast ($9.00), plus coffees. The food was fairly tasty, cooked well, carefully presented. I wasn't a fan of the beans (who is?), but everything else was more or less satisfying. Overall, I would describe brunch here as a-little-more-than-basic brunch.  Mind you, they do have a lunch and dinner menu, aside from brunch. So I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area again. With tax and tip, our brunch cost a little over $30.00."}
{"text":"It was with great anticipation, after reading some of the reviews that I came to Bistro Narra with a friend for lunch. The interior is nicer than the strip plaza location might indicate however once inside, it was obvious the place needed a bit more \"bustle\" or more people. At 1:00 pm on a Thursday afternoon, we were one of two tables occupied. It may be the high ceiling or the music but something seemed a little \"hollow\" about the place. The overall design is nice enough and a notch above average.  The food itself was not as good. I had the Narra Pasta which was their seafood pasta. The few noodles were floating in a rich tomato sauce and the seafood was overcooked with a few mussels, scallops and shrimp. However my biggest disappointment was an Italian restaurant (or a restaurant with an Italian themed menu) with no bread on the table! While we didn't ask for it, I was surprised that it was not brought out immediately after receiving our drinks. There was one young shy waiter whose service was good, however I wouldn't have expected any less given that we were two of four people in there.  The coffee (also another indicator of a great Italian restaurant) was not that great. We had the tiramisu for desert and it was OK. Altogether, lunch was close to $50 for two entrees, a slice of tiramisu and a coffee. A little much for the quality of the food. I might try it again for breakfast as some of the reviews seem to have had a more positive experience with that meal."}
{"text":"Located in a small mall on Winston Churchill and Thomas. Excellent food and service. We had veal chops which was cooked perfectly. Also order honey garlic salmon and a seafood pasta dish. All were excellent and food was served hot! I will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really really really bad food. And i mean really bad. We ordered a crepe and within 20 seconds everything had melted, it also tasted really gross. We got the special posted outside and they managed to make eggs taste terrible. Save your money."}
{"text":"Bistro Narra is a new restaurant that opened in December 2010 from the owners of The Apricot Tree, Franz and Esther Hotcholdinger. The Apricot Tree is a symbol of Austria, where Franz is from. The new restaurant is named after narra, the national tree of the Philippines, a nod to Esther's roots.   Bistro Narra is located in a somewhat out of the way strip mall and has a similar feel as the Apricot Tree -- fine dining but in a relaxed environment, daily specials, affordable prices. I think it is just slightly more expensive and the decor a little more formal than the Apricot Tree. Everything is white and very clean/minimalist. Apricot Tree had an open concept kitchen and Bistro Narra has a large rectangle window thing that allows us to see into the kitchen area. I noticed some of the waiters from Apricot Tree are now at Bistro Narra.   I came for Mother's Day dinner and the place was really busy. Good thing I made reservations and as we left there was a line at the door (rather unusual for the suburbs). They had a Lobster festival on right now. We shared the lobster sampler that had croquettes (yummy!), a cold salad, and an interesting sweet lobster/cappuchino soup (I know that sounds gross, but try it). That said, sampler plates tend to be for sharing and soup is an awkward thing to split. I also wanted to try the Narra roll, but they were all out:(   For the main course, I had the herb crusted halibut. It was just lovely and the tarragon cream sauce was just right, not too heavy. It was served on top of a bed of hand cranked thick pasta noodles. Mom had the seafood linguine, which was a generous portion with some really big scallops and shrimp. The menu is pretty different from Apricot Tree, but there are a few crossovers like the mushroom salad and pork & apple crepe. The menu focuses on entree salads, pastas/risottos, and crepes with a few meat entrees. The dessert selection is much smaller than Apricot Trees. I was disappointed they were out of tiramisu, which Apricot Tree is famous for (and by 'famous', I mean I tell all my friends about it). Next time.  Service was a little spotty (our table didn't have napkins, guy awkwardly had to take a chair from our table because they ran out of chairs) but it was understandable given the busy-ness of Mother's Day. And the servers are all very polite and professional.   This is a solid place for a nice meal and a welcome addition to the Mississauga restaurant scene."}
{"text":"This part or Mississauga definitely lacks of fine dinning options. The restaurant is ok, good enough for when there is nothing better around. Can not be compared with any fine dinning. Not worthy driving too it if you are not from the area.   However if you live close to it and don't feel like driving far for a sort of fine dinning experience, then it worth a try.   Portions are very small. Carters mostly to the richer elder crowd from expensive retirement homes around the restaurant. I ate there about 5 times for different occasions since it opened. The portions have always left me hungry. The food itself is not bad, yet not amazing nor worth the price.   On one occasion we went there with a group of friend for lunch and ordered crepes. They all came back as omelettes disguised as crepes. We were not very impressed and never went back. I live about 4 mins drive from the restaurant. On a different note, the owners are great and service is always good."}
{"text":"Bistro Narra is tucked away in a plaza on Winston Churchill at Thomas. We were 6 for dinner to celebrate a birthday. One of my guests is a vegetarian. Appies:  The \"Meatballatini\" consists of 3 very dry deep fried meatballs on some greens which are sitting on Ranch dressing in a Martini glass. Besides the whimsicl name and presentation, it was boring! Virtually tasteless despite the claim of three cheeses. The deep fried tofu in honey-soy glaze was actually quite good. Very unique presentation and taste. Somewhat like paneer. Mains: Chicken crepes were mediocre at best. Boiled chicken in a tasty sauce with a couple of dozen peas. Nice crepes and sauce, but overdone with the pea to chicken ratio. Seafood crepe: Cheaped out on the scallops (cut horizontally) and a few shrimp. Sauce was quite tasty, Atmosphere: Nice but a bit cold as there is a lot of window space and an open concept. Definitely not warm and cozy. Minimalist at best. Dessert: Raspberry white chocolate tarte was 'meh' Grand Marnier ice souffle was decent but over priced. Service: Efficient but not overly friendly or warm. Overall no \"wow factor\" and I am not likely to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food with great prices.  Seriously the food here is worth it.  Our party had pre set meals but everyone seemed very happy with all our food.  From the table bread to dessert.  Everyone complimented the food.  I think our host byob our table wine in which they hated a corkage fee.  No big deal.    The restaurant it self is quite small and doesn't sit a lot.  I like the open kitchen feel and that the chef is interactive with guests.    Lots of parking in the busy plaza   Service was just ok but the food and value makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great Austrian/ continental cuisine.  Seafood Crepes, veal, etc.  Quality & service are excellent."}
{"text":"Bistro Narra was highly recommended to me by a friend a year or so ago and we'd been meaning to check it out since then. We ended up going with friends last month and enjoying it so much that we returned a couple of weeks later with our son.  Our first visit was on Thanksgiving weekend and we were surprised when we arrived at 6:30 p.m. to a completely empty restaurant. We were hoping that wasn't a bad sign, but were reassured by the waiter that it was just because of the holiday. Sure enough, on our next visit the place was almost full.  On both visits, the service was very good. Wait staff were attentive and very friendly. We started with an amuse bouche of cauliflower purée, olive, pesto and tomato. Very tasty. On the second visit, the amuse was a crostini topped with flank steak, a tomato sliver and aioli. Very yummy.  For appetizer I ordered the Chesapeake Bay blue crab cakes and they were absolutely delicious. Crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. They were served with a miso glaze and green pea aioli. I enjoyed them so much that I ordered them again on our second visit.  My husband ordered salads on both occasions and raved about them both times. He had a smoked turkey and corn salad from the prix fixe menu on the first visit and a mushroom salad from the regular menu the second time. Both were very well-dressed and really delicious.  Other appetizers ordered were the soup of the day, which was squash and coconut soup (a hit), mussels with saffron cream (a big hit) and grilled and fried calamari which was served atop dressed greens with an aioli on the side.  On our first visit, three of us ordered the steak and lobster from the Prix fixe menu. The steak was good, as were the vegetables but the lobster tail was a little overcooked. The Schnitzel Narra was reportedly delicious with a lovely mushroom sauce.  On our second visit, my husband had the pistachio-crusted lamb chops with a barley risotto and he raved about all of it. I had the fillet mignon with black peeppercorn sauce, root vegetables and purple potatoes. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the portion was very generous.   Our friends chose two desserts from the pastry case. One was a creme caramel and the other a chocolate swiss roll. They were very happy with both of them.  We're so happy to have found this gem in our neighbourhood and will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Read some very good reviews. Read the menu and was impressed to see lots of nice combinations of regular fare to suit the regular crowd.  I was more interested in the non traditional food pairings and rare choices . The waitress told us there is a fixed prix menu for summer that cost $35 which included starter, entree and desert. There was quite a selection to choose from. Most restaurants you cannot choose from the special menu without getting the whole deal but we were told we were free to choose any of the item even if we choose not to have to fixed prix meal. We ordered the crab cakes and grilled calamari as well as eggplant parmesan. Crab cakes were delicious nice and hot tasty and moist. Calamari grilled to perfection and not over cooked or chewy. You could have it breaded and fried if you preferred.  Eggplant parm was good and tasty  I ordered duck breast which was on the special summer menu. It was the best duck i ever had. Tender and  juicy and not at all gamey. The paper thin skin was dry and cooked to a crisp. My son ordered lamb chops and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would definitely go back and highly recommend to everyone i know. I will try and have their brunch very very soon."}
{"text":"I went with a large group and everything went so well. Everyone loved their meal. The service was personable and quick. Our appetizers were very tasty. I had the mussels and it was a large amount! They were big and plump. The sauce was a great compliment to them. It wasn't overpowering but just right amount of wine and dill to give it a nice flavour. I tried my friend's warm mushroom salad and it was delicious. She had at least 5 different mushroom types in it and it was so savoury. For my entree I had the seafood crepes and this was really tasty. The crepe was fresh and the shrimp and scallops were not over done. I really love the spicy cream tomato based sauce that went with it. All 8 people at our table loved it so I'm hoping to go back and try more entrees! For the price, it's one of the best options for dining in the west end!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Came on a Sunday for brunch and it's a cute place. The food was delicious and they substituted salmon for the bacon in the Benedict which was nice. I recommend this place. Prices are reasonable and you have to try the coffee! If you know coffee, you know it's good."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for dinner. It's located in a casual plaza, with Rexall and Starbucks and stuff, but this place was a bit dressier. The seafood linguine was great (except for the usual sand bits the mussels, :S bleh) and I had a bite of the chicken crepe which was also really good. The place is small, but didn't feel crowded - since we knew we'd be a bigger group, made a reservation in advance with no issues. They have a bunch of specials which look like they'd be good for another visit :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on 3 Course for $30 menu for Seafood Fest 2016  Appetizer: Lobster Crab (instagram worthy with the contrast of colours but just so dry) Main: Mussels and Halibut on Risotto (Taste ok but really awkward plating for a restaurant dish) Dessert: One can only choose from what in the display case. Ended up with Apple Strudel, happy that it was warmed up before serving  We also ordered a la Carte:  Appetizer: Mushroom Salad ($7) Highly recommended! The mushroom is sauteed and well seasoned.  Main: Seafood Fettuccine in Marinara Sauce ($16) noodle nicely cooked al dente and with tons of seafood.   Seems like the item from the regular menu tasted a lot better than their \"special\" menu. The most disappointing experience was the limited selection of dessert with the prix.  Worth coming if you are in the neighbourhood. It is a solid restaurant for a night out without going to one of the bigger franchise in the area."}
{"text":"First visit today. Had several of their brunch specials and it was excellent value. Will definitely be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant in a small plaza surrounded by new townhouses. From the outside, it looks much bigger, but once you enter, it feels comfortable with high ceilings and an intimate feel to it. Instrumental music played in the background.   Happy: It came with warm twisty bread and a complimentary appy of a very small amount of smoked salmon and cucumber. We had the crab cakes for appetizer which was bigger than I thought it would be and there are two of them. There could have been more sauce to it.   Entree: we both ordered breaded veal with a tomato mushroom sauce which was hot and delicious. The fingerling potatoes just came out of the oven which I like them hot. The veggie portion could have been bigger.   The service was good until we had to wait longer for the bill.   Verdict:  I liked the food and the atmosphere and I would definitely go back to try their lunch and brunch menu."}
{"text":"As mentioned by other Yelpers, this is the sister restaurant to another local favourite, The Apricot Tree. And like it's sister resto - Bistro Narra is a gem!  ATMOSPHERE: It's not a very large restaurant, but compared to The Apricot Tree, it is much more light and airy. With more contemporary look/décor, and lots of windows allowing light through. Great for dates, and family occasions too.  SERVICE: Love the service here! Staff are super professional - look and act like servers in upscale restaurants. They're very attentive.  PRICE: Affordable. Entrées for dinner range from $15-$30.  FOOD: Super fresh ingredients, and beautifully presented dishes. Also mentioned by someone else, menu is similar to Th Apricot Tree's - as in there is some overlap but there are different regular dishes too. The dessert menu is also not as extensive. But they also have their own version of Crepe Festival too.  I've been here many times since it's opening, and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"So we live dead across the street from this restaurant and have been wanting to try it since it opened several years ago.  Bistro Narra sits among several other retailers in a strip plaza- rather inconspicuous.   Anyway, my husband had the schnitzel and I had the Salmon off from their Thai menu.  Both were excellent!   I dropped one star for their ambiance not that it's a huge thing but it counts for something."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  I ordered the lobster quissadilla.  It was good but alot more shrimp than lobster.   The potatoes on the side were good and nicely roasted.  Service was very slow.   Slow to get us water to start, slow to take our order, slow for the food to come out and slow to collect our plates when we were done eating.  Overall a decent place to eat but service is slow"}
