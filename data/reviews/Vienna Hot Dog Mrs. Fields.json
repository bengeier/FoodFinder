{"text":"This review is for Mrs Field and Vienna beef stand near Terminal A&B. This place is always closed, if they r open then there is a sign that says \"gone for 1hr\". I mean how can u stay in business when u are always closed."}
{"text":"This Mrs. Fields food stand is in Terminal A at McCarran. For $2.39 you can get a typical Mrs. Fields cookie that is sugary sweet and delicious -- a moist and chewy treat that is slightly crispy around the edges. I love their cookies, but, as with all airport dining, it's overpriced."}
{"text":"As a cookie lover, Mrs Field's Cookies are the standard. Not only warm, soft and delicious but they make me think of Christmas! Wifey and I always used to get them at Ala Moana in Hawaii when Mrs Field's was still on Oahu during the Holidays. 
I'm glad we saw one in the McCarran airport in Vegas. I'm not sure the dozen we bought will step foot on Hawaiian soil...hahaha"}
