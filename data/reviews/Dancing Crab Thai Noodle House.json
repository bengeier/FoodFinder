{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in pittsburgh. Delicious silky curries. Super nice staff and owner."}
{"text":"Best thai restaurant in town. Loved the duck noodle soup! The drubken noodle is very good also. Beware the spiciness rating here is no joke."}
{"text":"This place is all about the food! The drunken noodles were the best I have had. The noodles were soft and fresh, and the flavor was the perfect balance of savory and spicy. I ordered a 4/10 spice  level, and I wouldn't go higher. I usually order a 6 or so at other restaurants, but I wouldn't push it here. The pad Thai was tangy and delicious, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The noodles had a nice amount of sauce, making it different from the dry, bland pad Thai I have had elsewhere. They don't skimp on the scallions, herbs or onions either, so the two noodle dishes and tom yum soup we had were very fragrant and possessed a nice depth of flavor.

The space is rather unusual for a Thai restaurant, but I think it will be great as a BYOB restaurant. I look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had in pittsburgh, drunken noodle with seafood was amazing!!! Crab rangoon appetizer also 5/5 would recommend a friend."}
{"text":"Tried this fine dining spot based upon Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  The food (I got drunken noodles with chicken) was awesome.  And the place was very clean.

Thought something was wrong when I got there at 11:30 AM and only one person was there.  But, within minutes, the place filled up.

I deducted one star due to slightly slow service.  Hope that, as they get used to running this new business, things will improve.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken pad thai -- one of the best we've had.  We also had Pineapple curry w/ shrimp that was delish."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a couple days ago with a huge group of friends. I had high expectations, so that may account for my 4/5 star. Long story short: though this place didn't satisfy me to a 5 star degree (food wise), I was super impressed by the service.

I was SUPER hungry before stepping into the restaurant. I checked in on Yelp for a 10% discount and I was ready-to-go. However, the food, (understandably) took some time (as I went with a large party). Again, I was really hungry. I want to emphasize just how hungry I was in order to reveal the accuracy of my 4/5 review. Despite just how hungry I was, the food wasn't THAT impressive. It was standard in terms of quality and portion.

FOOD:
I got a See Yew spice level 3 (out of 10) with chicken. It was tasty and well-cooked! There wasn't much of a wow-factor though. I tried a bit of my friends' food, and my opinion stands accurate for all the dishes.

ATMOSPHERE:
Spacious. There's a bar area. Lots of seating, not as many customers (I went on a Saturday night). However, it's nice and clean. There's also a sanitary bathroom for paying customers.

SERVICE:
The waitress was really nice and helpful. She was patient and friendly the whole night. Someone from the kitchen, who I presume to be the owner and/or head chef came out to make sure everything was okay ... and that's really telling of how much the staff care.

I would come here again, but the far distance is a turn-off is I'm being completely honest. But my overall experience was positive."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pad See Ew and A Drunken noodle, both are overly salty, and over priced for what and how they are. Go easy on the soy sauce."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. Great food and great service. Friendly atmosphere. Lek is always accommodating of our large group. Thanks."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this new restaurant. The food was good, but was far overshadowed by the experience. 

My boyfriend ordered pork fried rice and I ordered shrimp pad Thai. Our food came out and mine was chicken not shrimp and my boyfriend's also looked like chicken. We told the waiter who took back both dishes. He came back with the fried rice and said he promised it was pork and to prove it, he brought out a small plate with a piece of raw pork and a piece of cooked pork for comparison - both bizarre and unsanitary. 
They then came back with my dish. It looked like they had reused the plate and scraped the old pad Thai off and I assumed put a new one on. Not great practice but I let it go. That was until I was eating my pad Thai and found chicken in it - they had not made me a new dish, they had just picked the chicken out (not very well) and added shrimp on top. I called them back to fix it. They were apologetic and gave us 10% off the check (they should have taken the meal off the bill) but only after they'd put a serious damper on our date night. 

Food was good but no chance we're coming back."}
{"text":"First time customer, definitely plan to stop back again! My husband and I stopped in on a Wednesday night for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised by the interior of the place. Much nicer than we expected. It's BYOB which is always a plus in my book. We got the crab Rangoon's as an appetizer. They were delicious. Light and crisp on the outside. We both got the pad Thai as an entree, in my opinion it had much more flavor than Thai Me Up. My husband got a level 1 spice with chicken (not a fan of spicy foods), and I got a level 5 with shrimp. Food came out very quick and was delicious. A lot of flavor, just the right amount of spice for a level 5. I'd compare the spice level to pusadees garden. The owner (I think) stopped by our table to ask how we heard about them and what we thought of the food. She was super sweet, and we appreciated the gesture. You could tell she was genuinely interested in our thoughts. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to have Thai food! Great curries and pot stickers. Probably one of the best Thai food places in Pittsburgh. Definitely coming back again. Came here around 7 on Wednesday and it was empty. Couple more people came in by the time we left. Each dish seems to be unique and interesting not only to see but also to taste."}
{"text":"Great new Thai joint!! I've been trying FOREVER to find authentic Thai food in Pittsburgh. Ever since my trip to Thailand nothing seemed to compare, but the Dancing Crab sure did prove me wrong! I ordered the drunken noodle (spice level 5 - definitely spicy but not overwhelming) and my best-friend ordered the pad Thai (spice level 3 - I wouldn't say it was spicy it was still pretty sweet.) I think some Thai restaurants fail with the meat, but the chicken here was delicious.

Service wise, they definitely have a few kinks to work out but don't let that deter you! The staff was very nice and polite, but they could use an extra hand.

Can't wait to go back and try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"A new thai place that hasn't gotten its love by the south siders yet.
Don't be fooled by its empty space- the food was probably the best i've had in pittsburgh.
Great noodle entrees- very flavorful and good portions for reasonable prices. I tried the drunken noodles/ tom yum seafood noodle soup. They were both really great and tasty.
I was a bit disappointed with the appetizer, fried calamari. It was meh and priced too high for the quality/quantity we were given. 
The cook/owner was very excited to see us and curious about our inputs, since this place is still in its infancy. However, I was unsure about the waiting staff-we were the only ones at the restaurant but it took a long time for her to get to us every time we needed her.
I'm hoping the kinks will be worked out in the next couple weeks, because I'll be back for their food soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The pad Thai and dancing noodle are both delicious. The food is pretty comparable to Nicky's. The staff are extremely helpful and the service was great. Only issue is the decor inside, it's hard to tell what they serve when you walk in, but my guess is that it's a work in progress. BYOB with no corking fee is also great."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai.  The noodles were long... Just like they should be...  Flavorful and yummy dish!"}
{"text":"IMO some of the best thai in the city!  I am very picky about thai food and I think I could eat here every night.  I ended up going twice in one weekend!  Almost knocked a star off for overall experience, but the food is just too good.  It was free BYOB at the time, but it was listed as limited time for their opening.

First time there it was pretty slow and our server was friendly, but it was very awkward.  Neither time could the waitress really elaborate on any dishes.  We started with the dancing chicken which was delicious.  Served with a very good sauce, but we definitely could've used more of it.  We had the Drunken Noodle and Pad See Ew.  Their Pad See Ew might be my new favorite and the tofu was fantastic.  Our lunches were served with a salad only.  The menu says all entrees served with crab rangoon and choice of soup/salad but we didn't ask.  The entrees also came out at different times, but oh well.

Second time I wanted to try the pineapple fried rice, but they were out of pineapple.  I went with the Panang curry, which is again one of the best I've ever had.  Our entrees did not come with crab rangoon, soup or salad so I'm not sure if that's only a lunch thing?  But they should really specify that on the menu since it was misleading both times.  And again our entrees came out at different times.  The cons definitely will not stop me from coming back as they can easily be fixed.  The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Best Thai food in town so far!!! Strongly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. We saw \"fish cake\" on the menu on the blackboard but when we actually ordered \"Sorry no fish cake, we only have crab cake\". So we ordered it. Horrible. Imitation crab, overly dry, crappy sauce, on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Seriously? Who serves iceberg lettuce in a Thai restaurant? or any restaurant for that matter?  This crappy crab cake was ironic because \"crab\" is in the restaurant's name. Maybe you should change it to dancing crap?  Oh and that wasn't it. I ordered Pad Thai. What I got was nothing more than broken bits of overcooked, soggy, oily noodles with barely any flavor. There was probably a quarter gallon oil on that dish. I guess you can legally still call it pad thai, but it had none of the proper flavor profile of pad thai. I've had much better pad thai at places in Oakland and Squirrel Hill at a much more reasonable price. Meh. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times, everything is fresh, the food is spectacular. It's  clean crisp fresh tasting food. Soups are good salads are. Drunken noodles excellent, crab fried rice is excellent. Pad Thai is as good as any others I've had. I like the dancing chicken appetizer.

 Staff and the woman who owns the place are very nice people!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out, based on these reviews. The first time we tried for lunch they were closed (even though it was during business hours--not sure what was up there), so today we decided to order delivery. We ordered two lunch specials with soup and the Dancing Chicken appetizer. The appetizer didn't come at all and the soup was maybe half a cup of bland broth with a mediocre wonton. My Pad See Eww was supposed to be tofu and had chicken, and was just okay. Not awful but not a lot of flavor. I reached out to the delivery service to report the problem, and the restaurant argued with them that they had gotten everything right. I can assure you they did not. All I wanted was a refund for the missing appetizer (which they apparently did grudgingly) and an apology for the mistake. I was planning on giving them another chance but not now. The food may be decent but they clearly need to get their act together service wise. I might have become a regular customer (and work in a business right of Carson street with a lot of co-workers who are always looking for fun new lunch places). Instead, I'll just skip it."}
{"text":"From the reviews and stars, I was really excited to try this place. But I was not happy with it at all, mainly because it felt like the service didn't care. I ordered from Postmates which could be my main issue but I still shouldn't have had these problems...

I ordered 2 small soups and a spicy Thai basil. I was missing one soup, the other soup didn't even have the correct protein in it. I ordered NO spice on the soup and it was SO. SPICY. My lips were on fire. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to trying their Tom Kha but I got a Tom Yum which is good but it wasn't the correct order anyway. Oh, and there was also some kind of small bay leaf in my soup which also threw me off. 

The spicy Thai basil I was disappointed in the most and the reason being is because it WAS really tasty and that's the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars. Unfortunately, my 2 spice level seemed like an 8! I couldn't even eat it because it was so freakin spicy! I had to throw it away and that pained me. Not to mention, there was NO Thai basil in the actual dish. ZERO. Isn't that ingredient the most important? It's in the name!!! 

I'd like to try this place again, based on the taste and these reviews. Maybe I will but right now my mouth is literally on fire so it's not on my good list."}
{"text":"We loved our meals!  Had the crispy thai fried chicken and fresh roll appetizers which were both very good.  The Drunken Noodles with shrimp was definitely one of the best examples of this dish that I've eaten- I had a \"2\" spice level and it had a pretty good kick.  The noodles were the perfect texture and it was loaded with shrimp and veggies and not too oily.  Our server was lovely and the owner also came out to chat- I hope they do well because the food really is excellent and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Dancing Crab is an excellent new restaurant on Carson Street! The best Thai I have had in Pittsburgh, hands down! I had the drunken noodles and it was incredible with tasty flavor. I forgot to take a picture of it I was so excited to eat it!!! This place has BYOB for free, great for parties and gatherings! The wait staff is incredibly friendly too, be sure to stop in and try it for yourself! I will absolutely be back again :)"}
{"text":"I went when they were open for exactly 1 week. In fact, I think I had to add them to yelp so I could check in :-).  The space is beautiful and the flavors were delicious.  They were really interested in immediate feedback to know what they could improve on which I found endearing.  Our server was so attentive and super nice.  My trusty sidekick and I shared a tom kha soup, an order of fried calamari and an order of drunken noodles with pork and it was more than enough food to share!  They all tasted really good but we especially loved the drunken noodles.  Added bonus, we got free beers!  (I think that was a limited opening special). 

Owner came in while we were there and she was super nice - I wish them the best of luck - the food is delicious and I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and got Drunken Noodle and the Duck Noodle Soup. I thought both were great! Would love to try their curries some time.

Drunken Noodle: They give you an option to choose your spice level from 1-10, and I found that the 5 for the Drunken Noodle was plenty spicy. The noodles also had a bunch of vegetables in it, which made me feel a little better about eating the whole plate. Easily could have boxed some for later, but I couldn't stop eating. 

Duck Noodle Soup: I really enjoyed the unique flavoring of the soup, and would order it again next time I visit. The duck has crispy skin which gets soggy if you keep it in the soup, so I would recommend eating some before it gets soggy."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review, but this was a really disappointing experience, and I think people should know before they go. Maybe I was in on an off day (Sunday just before noon), but still...

I got the Tom Kha soup, pan fried potstickers and glass noodle salad. The soup looked absolutely nothing like the photos in another review. It wasn't terrible, but there was so little coconut milk in it that it was spread out over the top in little beads, which looks unappetizing (like curdled milk) and doesn't tase all that great. Overall it was the best part of my meal, there was a decent amount of greens and chicken in it, although the chicken was a little tougher than ideal. 

Potstickers were pretty bland, I don't know if there was any seasoning in the pork. I guess the amount of food for the price was appropriate, but the flavor just wasn't there. 

By the time I got to the glass noodle salad, I was kind of over the whole meal. Presentation was disappointing, and there was just way too much dressing. It didn't taste fresh, which made me wary of the seafood (again, decent protein ratio for the price, but I only ate a little bit of it.) It was swampy and unbalanced, and I ended up eating a few bites and leaving.

I hate to bash a neighborhood restaurant, but there are two other Thai restaurants in the area that are only slightly more expensive and manage to get it right. I would encourage anyone looking for a good meal to try one of them instead. I hope Dancing Crab was just having a bad day, they're still new. Maybe I'll try them again sometime and stick to curry or something."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  Portions are hearty, and both the kids and the adults liked the menu. Service was terrific as well--really friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly, I went here because the cute crab logo on their sign caught my eye driving down Carson. 

I'm usually really meh on Thai food but really enjoyed their rendition of pad thai and drunken noodles. The pad thai was well balanced, you could taste each ingredient, and the sauce covered each noodle but wasn't greasy. Same can be said about the drunken noodles. We asked for a 2 spice level on both and the DN was much spicier than the pad thai so keep that in mind. I added shrimp to my noodles and the shrimp that came with it was amazing...big, meaty tail-on that were seasoned and cooked properly. Often time the shrimp feels like an after thought but these went with the dish perfectly. 

Dining room was spacious and the service polite/prompt.

Dinner portions were large and matched the price charged. I had enough noodles for a snack next day and it reheated beautifully. Definitely the best thai food in the south side and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Ultimate FAIL  Tried to place an order for delivery through Yelp.   Called to check on my order.  They didn't have it.  Yelp, Grubhub and the Crab charged my credit card twice.  The restaurant agent said they weren't doing delivery and that they would refund my $.  Still waiting........  Will have to dispute it now..  FAIL"}
{"text":"How lucky I am to have found this authentic Thai restaurant with the most DELICIOUS FOOD!!  I would give 6 stars if possible! The owner and staff are super friendly ...and the food was ready in about 15 minutes and was extremely fresh and seasoned to perfection.  I ordered take out and had soup, fried calamari and the best pad Thai EVER!   This is a new restaurant.... everybody should go here because they have the best Thai food... 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out a couple weeks ago.. I was SO impressed with the huge portions, moderate prices and super delicious food. We tried the crab rangoon, the drunken noodles, and the pad thai. All were delicious, but I liked the pad thai the best. Keep in mind the food here runs pretty spicy, so order mindfully! I went a little too hot on the drunken noodles and was having some trouble finishing them. Overall, really delicious and I am looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times and I'm glad to see you're finally up and running. lok is an owner hostess. You must try Penang curry."}
{"text":"Well, the Yelp reviews encouraged me to try this place out and I have to admit, my fellow yelpers know what they are talking about. To the point that I loved it so much, I had to take friends there the next night too... there is never too many noodles in my life!

The space was renovated and is lovely. As a BYOB right now (it appears they may be reopening the bar at some point) it was great to take in a bottle of wine and sit in a quiet restaurant to catch up with friends. The waiter was very friendly and attentive!

We started with the steamed dumplings, great choice! They had very good flavor and were cooked perfectly! Then on to the spicy basil noodles, pumpkin curry, and pad see ew - I couldn't tell you which was my favorite.. because they all win! My suggestion, is go there with a bunch of people and order everything! (who am I kidding, that's usually my suggestion for everywhere) -- but really this time, get a variety of dishes, because none of them disappointed!

With the Yelp check in discount and no corking fee the check almost didn't seem fair - that much good food for only a little bit of money. Yes, I will be back soon... and then maybe go back the next night again! :)"}
{"text":"Very good place, tasteful decor and even tastier food. We got the Tom yum soup, Tom Kha soup, and drunken noodles. Everything was amazing, fresh, and very flavorful. The waiter was polite and attentive, and the food came out hot. I definitely recommend this restaurant, and I look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Thai food and it was DELISHH!!! I tried the Drunken Thai plate, the drunken noodles were to die for."}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in Thailand for 5 years and we are always looking for good Thai food. We found the owner Lek (from the Thai Bites food truck) opened a new restaurant and had to give it a try. We ordered the som tam (papaya salad) which is not on the menu and found it just like they make in Thailand. We have tried the som tam at many places but none were as good as the Dancing Crab. We also tried the koa soy, a famous dish from northern Thailand, and it was just like they make it in Chiangmai. Most know Thai food for the spiciness, but Lek also captures the sour, salty and sweet flavors that good Thai food is all about. We would definitely recommend the Dancing Crab for authentic, flavorful Thai food."}
{"text":"We'd order from here much more if they fixed their grubhub menu. Food is great but most items online have disappeared. (edit: they fixed it! excellent food)"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner and had a delicious pumpkin curry! My friend ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and noted that it wasn't salty enough for his palette. When he asked the server for some soy sauce, the owner came out and offered to remake the dish to his tastes. We told her that wasn't necessary, but she insisted. Just a few minutes later she brought out a new dish and it was perfect!

The food here is great, and the service goes above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Really good!! The curry noodle was fantastic, very fresh vegetables!!! I liked the Tom Yum soup as well, got it at a 10 and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner with a friend. I didn't know much about it but saw the rave reviews on yelp and was excited to try it. 

We came in at 5:30 on a Wednesday and were the only people in the restaurant. They have a good selection of rice and noodle dishes on their menu, and I ended up going with vegetable pad Thai. They let you choose your spicy level from 1-10, and I chose a 7. 

The food itself was awesome. Very flavorful, quality ingredients, tasted authentic. It was pretty spicy - I would probably err on the side of caution on the spicy level here. 

My ONLY complaint was the service. Like I said, we were the only people in the whole place. Our server was awkward and had no personality. She asked the same questions multiple times and also asked us to get our credit cards out to pay in the middle of the meal. Just bizarre. So I knocked off a star for the service alone. But the food was definitely worth 5 stars. I would for sure try again, or order take out. I just hope they get busier so they can stay open!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot in the South side. Not sure why it's so empty all the time but the food merits more attention. All their noodle dishes pack a good balance of flavor and volume and the only complaint I have would be that it's a tad pricier than the other Thai options in the city."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout today and everything we ordered was fabulous. Probably the best pad Thai I've had in a long time. Portion sizes were huge!! 

Just a heads up, I went with 5 for the spice level and it was quite spicy and I like spice. I might go less next time. 

New go-to Thai place!"}
{"text":"If I hadn't read the Yelp reviews we probably would not have sought this place out. It looks like just another South Side food spot. Nothing particularly alluring from the outside. Let me tell you, this place is amazing. 
Dare I say better than Nicky's and Pusadees?  It just might be.  What it lacks in ambiance is made up in the food.   My partner had the pad Thai and I had a curry.  I don't even have words. They were perfect.  My partner is always complaining that he can't find Thai food hot enough in PGH. This is the first place that delivered the flavor and the spice. He's hard top please and supported me 5 start rating.
It is currently BYOB. But there is a bar so it looks like they are working on a liquor license or something. The point is, BYOB now... Bar later.  
Regardless.... This place is authentic and excellent.  A lot of thought went into the dishes and they are perfectly executed.  So fresh too  So good!"}
{"text":"Thai Bites used to be the favorite place my colleagues and I grabbed lunch from in Strip District. They made the best Thai noddles in town. My favorite were Drunken noodle and Pad thew. A big box of delicious noodle cost only $8. The owner was incredibly nice. I was sad to hear that they opened the restaurant in Southside rather than Strip district. My friends and I went this past Saturday. While the noodle was still great, they offer more options on the menu. The owner still remembered what I used to order and how I liked my noodle done. 

I have tried almost all the Thai restaurants in town. This one is the best. You should definitely go."}
{"text":"Wow - this place is amazing. Thai hot and flavorful. Had the pumpkin seafood curry at 7 and I am completely delighted."}
{"text":"They're finally back! What used to be the Thai Bites food truck and Jade 99 supermarket in the Strip District, they're a real deal B&M Thai restaurant. While there are plenty of other Thai places in the city, this particular one is worth checking out and returning to again and again. First, the physical space is very spacious, comfortable, and yet slightly vintage with the exposed brick walls. The walls have framed photographs, lighting is mild, and there's also background music and a TV. 

For now, they are doing free drinks, including Thai teas for lunch and beers for dinner. That should be reason enough to stop by--the owner makes a very tasty Thai tea, as well as Thai green tea (more floral, also with condensed milk). Finally, the food. While the menu is slightly smaller than at some other places, the owner makes sure that every single item is up to her standard, and the foods that we've tried so far are all exactly the same as they were back at Thai Bites. We ordered our favorite stir fried noodles, which came with large servings of noodles and vegetables. So much flavor, perfect amount of spice from Thai chili peppers, and great texture in the noodles. We also had a dancing (fried) chicken appetizer, which had crispy skin, and tender meat.

Everything was perfect, and Dancing Crab is now our favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh without a doubt!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Eat there. Hurry. The portions are good sizes too, we had leftovers for dinner and it was just as delicious. Priced extremely reasonable. Will definitely go back. We had the basil fried rice and green curry."}
{"text":"Great food, dancing shrimp, pad Thai and drunken noodles were delicious.

Waitress wasn't very attentive and didn't seem to be in the most pleasant mood but the owner did come over and she was really nice and kind.

Also called originally to order but no answer on the phone so went in person and the place was empty.

Definitely will be back to try more menu options though."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around. Pineapple curry is my life. I work in station square and order it probably once a week!"}
{"text":"Yum! I had the green curry with tofu and asked for veggies too. It was perfect. Veggies were good, tofu was delicious, sauce was delicious and perfectly spiced. My only qualm is that they didn't send utensils with my order and curry is decidedly hard to eat with your hands, but I'll forgive it this time."}
{"text":"The gf and I eat a lot of Thai.....I mean A LOT OF THAI.  This is the freshest and arguably the best Thai in Pittsburgh.  Service was also very good and a great atmosphere.  We started off with the fresh spring roll, which comes with tofu, chicken and shirmp (nobody else does that!).  These were excellent!  I then got the Tom Kah soup which has lemon grass, spicy lime chili, coconut cream, tomato, red onion and  I added squid.  The soup had all the flavors you would expect in a thai dish.  Sweet, coconut, heat, tangy, fishy, salty...all served fresh and a nice portion.  We stuck to basics and the Gf ordered pad see ew with beef (spicy level 0) and I ordered drunken noodles with squid (spicy level 5). Both meals had fresh, colorful and flavorful vegetables.   Seaonsoning, noodle texture and proteins were all done right and  cooked to perfection.  Spice level on the 5 was right in the middle just enough heat with a slow burn but without having to chug your glass of water.  Lastly, we had sticky rice with Mango, which was as expected.  Only issue I saw was that only one guy that was doing wait staff/host duty.  As he was taking orders, running food, seating people etc.  I watched two people come in, have to wait for about 2 min and then leave.  Who ever you two are, you missed out on a great meal.  GF and I highly recommend this new, but still hidden gem on Carson.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Arrived at about 7 on a Sunday, and there was one waiter and a giant party. It took a while just to get menus. The poor guy was very busy! Probably should have had one more waiter.. anyway, the menu was kinda small, and we both decided to get noodle dishes. He explained that it was thai spicy level 1-10. I picked a 3, and my mother picked the 5. Unfortunately, 5 was wayyy too spicy. It was tasty, but kinda felt like we were going to die. I never send food back unless absolutely necessary and this was necessary. We sent it back and got a spicy level 1. From then on, it was enjoyable! Both dishes were tasty and the staff was incredibly nice about the returned dish. Besides curry, there isn't a whole lot besides the two noodle dishes we tried that  vegetarians can have. For appetizers, fried tofu was the only option. Won't be my go-to thai place, but it was authentic (ouch) and tasty. Bring your own milk."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Food was so good I lived in Thailand for a few years, and this food holds up against the food I ate there. The owner is so nice. This is my new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday and I want to go back today!  We had the Penang curry with shrimp.  The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked.  We also had the drunken noodles.  Thus is one of my favorite dishes to order at Thai restaurants.  The preparation here was delicious.  The lunch started with a cup of soup that contained one delightful dumpling.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner while visiting Pittsburgh and had a pleasant experience overall. I ordered the pad Thai and my friend got the pad see ew and we were both happy with our meals. The portions were large and relatively inexpensive yet still delicious.

The waitstaff was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was relaxing and neat. I would recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner to anyone that lives in or is exploring the South Side!"}
{"text":"We had a mixed experience. Some of our dishes were very good others were fair and the dessert special a disaster. I will start with the fact that Carsen Street was bustling on Saturday night. I brought my parents who are in their eighties and have very specific requests especially about spice. The restaurant is under renovations and it has a strange feel when we entered. We were seated in the back at a table in the center of the room. The staff although friendly was not efficient - long wait times to order, no communication with us, no refills of water or tea without asking several times. Waitstaff should be proactive. I used a Yelp check in for a 10% discount and the waiter took my phone from me. She should have asked me to check off that it was used not just take my phone and touch my key pad. We started with Tom Yum Soup. The waiter asked if we had been here before and said that the food was much spicier than other Thai restaurants- on that request we downgraded to a 3 - we should have ordered a 4 or 5 as it was not spicy enough. On the flip side we ordered the Dancing Crab Rice for my parents and they do not like spice and we ordered a 1 and it came with at least a 3 to 4 spice level. If this dish is naturally spicy they should have warned them. Needless to say they could not eat it. Not once did the waiter ask if they wanted something else. I liked the dish and took it to go so it was not wasted but it was a sign of poor service and sloppy food prep. The really bad part of our meal was the end. After waiting 30 minutes the mango sticky rice arrived, a very small order with just a sliver of mango- the rice was not quite right. When my mother complained that she did not like the dessert, the waiter explained that they did not have the coconut milk sauce that it is usually prepared with so they served it to us without it. This was a daily special that they had featured on the chalkboard in the entrance. They, one should have told us in advance that they were missing an ingredient, and two, they should have offered to get us something else or offer to not charge us. The staff apologized but did nothing. If a wait staff has to say sorry they should bring it to the managers attention or offer to fix it. The staff and owner need to improve on service. I did like the green curry and the Pad Thai, Thai Basil Chicken was fair and I think they switched the chicken for pork but I ate it anyway. Pass on the dancing chicken unless you are a kid who likes chicken fingers. The steamed dumpling special was good. I was very disappointed with the service. Another poor sign is that they use styrofoam and carelessly throw plastic straws on the table with water glasses without asking so they get a huge zero for sustainability. It is BYOB so that's a plus but because of poor service and lack of customer care on the food prep/presentation I would opt to go to Thai Me Up over Dancing Crab for Pittsburgh Southside Thai."}
{"text":"We were told our food would take a half hour. Our food took an hour and a half to be delivered even though we only live a few streets away. Upon delivery, the food was cold. The manager did not want to provide any discount after our wait and didn't believe us when we said our food was cold. The food (after being heated up) was good but the service was very frustrating."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find out about Dancing Crab opening in the South side as I live right in the center of the neighborhood and am constantly craving Thai food without anywhere to go (Sorry Thai Me up, not into it). On top of Dancing Crab opening...they have Khao Soi on their menu, which is my favorite! I had a girlfriend of mine meet me there for lunch and both of us were super excited to get something warm and spicy! My friend ordered the tom kha soup and wontons and I, of course, got the Khao Soi. I was told that the tom kha soup was really good and I loved my dish! My only real critique is that I got a 8 out of 10 on heat and I could have probably went with a 10. It was not nearly as spicy as I would have wished. Overall though, I loved the place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"** Generous portions with food on the spicier side, so keep that in mind when you pick spicy level from 1-10. Solid Thai option in Southside but nothing extraordinary.

I went here with a group of friends on a rainy day, so there weren't a lot of people here. I saw immediately that the pad kee mao and the pad Thai seemed to be the most popular options here, so I went with the pad Thai.

SPICE LEVELS:
Without reading any reviews on the spice level, I went with a spice level of 7, and they definitely packed the heat. Definitely had the waiter refill my water a few times, who probably noticed me sweating a bit and with teary eyes since he asked if it was a bit too spicy for me. I have a decent spice tolerance from eating other Asian foods, but not a super spice enthusiast. I'd have to say level seven was manageable but a bit too hot for me to the point where it wasn't the most enjoyable and took away from getting other flavors from the noodles... Going down to a 6 probably would have been perfect.

PAD THAI / PORTIONS: Generous portions considering the price, definitely felt satisfied at the end of the meal. However, I wish the noodles on the pad Thai had better texture and were more chewy. Noodles seemed a bit mushy.

SERVICE: overall friendly and refilled water plenty of times as he saw I needed it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food my husband and I have ever had. Large portions and perfect flavoring makes this place our new go to. The owner is a sweet lady who is passionate about each dish that she makes. Currently BYOB with no corking fee!!! Definitely recommend the Drunken noodles with pork and crab rangoons!"}
{"text":"Came here for my mom's birthday and her first thai experience. Couldn't have been better! She loved her basil fried rice. The dancing chicken appetizer was delicious m, as well. The service was fast and friendly, and the interior of the restaurant is spotless. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Southside!
We really like the flavors in all the dishes. As opening special, BYOB is free, and the food comes with complimentary soda. Very tasty food, presented neatly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend getting :
- Spring roll's (tasteless, burnt on the ends... needed something)
- The Dancing Shrimp (could have been better, was tasteless)
- the Pan Fried Potsticker (Bland, but alright.... Pot stickers are a go to Asian based food. I love pot stickers. I wouldn't get these again)
- Duck Noodle Soup (I love Duck, this was disappointing)
- Crab Rangoon (these were different, they had some broccoli in them, they weren't awful but I wouldn't get them)

*Do not get anything with seafood in it. All of mine was overcooked to the point of tasting like rubber. the chicken was good, the duck was over cooked but good*

Might try again:
- The Chicken Tom Yum 
- The Pla Goong

Would recommend:
- The Spicy Basil Salad (Awesome)
- The Mango Chicken Salad (Flavorful)"}
{"text":"We are in from Ohio for a conference and found this gem on Yelp. We met the owner who told us there is a small menu because she makes all the food and what she has she does well. So true! We had crab Rangoon which was a little different from the norm and delicious; drunken noodles which was thicker noodles in a delicious sauce with your choice of protein, excellent, and lastly I had the duck curry which was divine. The duck was fried and laid in pieces on top of the red curry, it had red and green peppers, peas, tomatoes, Pineapple, and lychee fruit. The combination of all these flavors had me eating more than I had room. I definitely recommend this restaurant, and I frequent Thai places"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this Thai place in southside! I got the veggie tom kha soup, it was very flavorful and fresh. The soup was filled with a variety of vegetables and spiced appropriately for me (4/10). I got the drunken noodles for dinner which was also awesome! They give you very big portions, and the prices are very reasonable. We had great service, so I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Total disappointment.  The service was nonexistent... we stopped in around 830 in a Friday night.  No one greeted us.  We had to walk back to the very back to be seated, and had to keep walking back to the back to get water, to order food, etc.  After 45 mins of waiting for our appetizers, we tracked down the waiter to cancel our order.  

Super bummed to have this terrible experience in my neighborhood, I'll try again in a month or so."}
{"text":"I've had take-out from here a few times now and have not yet been disappointed.  The quality/quantity of the food has been stellar each time especially at how affordable the price is (I've only gotten lunch, not dinner) and each time, I've been able to get two meals out of it. The owner is super friendly. I can't speak to the service other than my interactions at ordering/picking up - which have always been good. You are getting quality Thai food at a pretty great price and generous portions, which is enough for me when I'm craving Thai food, so I wouldn't let the negative reviews about service deter you from giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This was good not great Thai.  I had green curry at an 8.....They seemed to just add pepper flakes so not the complexity of flavor as other places.  Granted it was lunch but the room was cold and the amount of food was not equal to the cost. $13.00 for lunch and a mug of tea  seemed high. I will say the staff was extremely friendly and helpful..  will try again for dinner and try a few more things."}
{"text":"The best meal here is the Pad Thai and, in general, the noodle dishes. I've also tried appetizers including potstickers and the Thai fried chicken. Both were very bad. The potstickers seemed like they were warmed via microwave, and the chicken was poorly breaded and just a cutlet served in pieces. I think they should stick to what the do well and drop the rest. My suggestion: skip the appetizers and just get a well-known noodle dish. It'll probably be very good. Also the majority of their business is take-out, the ambiance is nil."}
{"text":"This place has quite a few vegan & vegetarian options. I ordered some green curry with tofu to go. The flavors were spot on and everything was very fresh. I also got some of their fried tofu, which I was not impressed with. It didn't seem to have enough seasoning, and I think it could have been a bit more crispy. I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"We passed this restaurant on our way to the Moth storytelling show and made a mental note to try it out sometime, but when the show was sold out we decided to head over.  Disclaimer: My wife and I have lived and worked in Thailand, and are fairly critical of the Thai Food we eat here. 

We sampled four entrees:

Pad Thai with shrimp: about as good as we've had in the US. 

Pad See Ew with Chicken: I think this is the best I've had in the States. Her recipe reminds me of some that I used to get at a small restaurant in Khon Kaen (Northwest Thailand, Issan provence). 

Pumpkin Curry.  Never really ate this in Thailand, but we alway try it at US restaurants when they have it.  I like this one about as much as the recipe at Nicky's Thai Kitchen (which has been our favorite).

The last one was a special, fried rice with crab that was amazing.  

We had a really nice conversation with the owner, Lec, who was super  friendly, and even shared some green beans with fermented crab that she had made for her Thai employees.  This will be our new go to restaurant for Southside, and Thai Food in general when we are in  Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We went here the first week it opened and absolutely loved it! We ordered the duck curry and the green curry noodles. Both were the perfect amount of spice. The service was exceptional and we definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. The. Bomb. I was blown away by how delicious the drunken noodles were. My boyfriend used to be a stubborn and faithful fan of Nicky's, but almost immediately declared that the green curry here is better - it's thick, flavorful, and the meat is perfectly cooked and tender. We immediately started sending our friends here and have been back multiple times."}
{"text":"This new Thai restaurant is the best Thai in Pittsburgh so far. We ordered Kao Soy & Pad Thai. I love Pad Thai's flavor. I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I really liked the food, but hated the service. I was here for a date, so we wanted to take our time and was there to socialize over spread out appetizers and food orders. The waitress was rude to me before we even sat down. We hadn't even been seated for 30 seconds and she asked if we were ready to order. We were obviously talking and hadn't even opened the menu. She came back 4 times in less than 5 minutes asking if we were ready to order yet. Once we got our food we never saw her again. I had fairly spicy noodles and had drank my water before the food had even come out. I never once got offered or had to opportunity to ask for a refill. 

Other than the service, the food was really good. I would come back, but never with a date."}
{"text":"Dancing Crab is a nice new Thai restaurant on the south side and Pittsburgh at that. This was my first time trying to place out, it kept coming up on my yelp suggestions to try in my area. 

We ordered the crab Rangoon's, chicken pad thai, & chicken green curry. The Rangoon's were done very well, normally crab Rangoon's can be very cream cheese like and these weren't. The flavor was nice and the mixture had a nice consistency. 

The pad Thai is why I gave them a four star and not five. It was very delicious and done well but they put entirely way to many peanuts. It was almost overkill because it smelled like a plate of peanut butter but, it tasted great still. Next time I know to tell them light please.

The green curry which normally isn't my go to curry was fabulous. The curry was spiced perfectly, vegetables cooked tender and not to soggy and the chicken was just right. Also the portion sizes were great!

I will definitely visit this place again. Also recommend folks to try as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Flavors were great.  A bit hotter on the 1-10 scale for me, and I am accustomed to ordering thai food.  EVERYONE WAS  SO ACCOMODATING, however,  and insisted on remaking although I was just taking home, at that point.  Everyone there was great and there was so many intriguing dishes on the menu!!! Will definitley be back soon but will order on the light side to be safe! We also didnt know it was BYOB. Not sure if they are expecting to have liquor license approved or not...  I am good with it either way!!"}
{"text":"For the location it's excellent. Above average Thai food especially for Pittsburgh. Came during dinner and service was pretty good; food came out at an acceptable duration. I can see people's concern with there being only one waitress on hand but it's worth a stop by. Would love to see this place make it"}
{"text":"Authentic, generous portions, quality ingredients including the meats they use and friendly staff. My wife and I found our new Thai place since Pusadees garden has closed."}
{"text":"Went on a whim Sunday night after a long day.The place was about to close and the owner came out and warmly greeted me.As I have a business on this street as well we talked abut the slow season and what not.I ordered the shrimp appetizer and the drunken noodles.After telling me that they were out of chicken,I ordered beef instead which was fine,they had sold out.The owner asked me to taste it to see if it was to my liking and after tasting it,I am a customer for life.This is true Thai food,so make sure to ask if you would NOT like it spicy.This was a true treat for the tastebuds,I cant wait to go back later tonight for a new treat! Great owner,great customer service"}
{"text":"New business!  From what I heard, the owner used to run a Vietnamese/Asian food mart in the strip district.  She was extremely friendly, the dining room was extremely clean and had modern feel.  Bonus points for opening later than 9 pm, the time I usually find a bite to eat after a long shift.

I came in and ordered...

Appetizers:

Glass Noodle Salad.  This was one of the most refreshing cold noodle salads I had in a long, long time.  The seafood inside tasted fresh, the fish sauce they used was livened up with a squeeze of fresh lime and overall very delicious!  I would order this again!

Crab Rangoons.  Yup, the wonton over skins were thin and crispy and just enough filling but you only get 5?  Now it looks like I have to fight my better half for the fifth piece; who wants to split it when it is berry berry good.

Main dish...

Pad Thai with Shrimp.  A good dish.  They prepare their shrimps perfectly and it seems to resemble shrimp scampi!  An important note about their spices, it appears that if the more spicier you order the saltier it gets so be mindful that the saltiness is proportionate to the spice level.  You may want hot oil sauce on the side instead of having them cook it into the dish as a precaution.

Also, there is a special yelp check in deal to save 10% so take advantage of that when you dine!  I will be back next time to try their curries."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. Really good food and reasonable prices allow this place to hold its own against Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf.

Clean and fresh restaurant with friendly service. Duck soup, pad thai, pumpkin curry and the other dishes are great. Only wish the menu had a few more choices--but this clearly is a \"Noodle House\" so I am nit picking. Chef (and likely owner) kept coming out of the kitchen to talk to the tables.

A win!"}
{"text":"I stopped over here for lunch today. I noticed that you get 10% off your bill with a Yelp check in. There was only one lady waiting on me and each time I tried to get her attention she ran away from me pretty fast. Seems like she was the only one there and very busy.

Anyways, I was a bit uncertain about the menu. I was looking at the curry dishes.  The waitress did explain that they can make it less spicy if I wanted but advised me to go with the Pad Thai with chicken . It comes in a lunch portion and although not listed you get side salad to go with it.

I wanted regular ice tea but they only had hot tea or sweetened Thai tea. I opted for the latter. Drank it although it was way too sweet for me. I got my food fairly quickly and it was so hot the steam was literally fogging up my glasses. All I was given for utensils was a fork and the noodles which came with this entree were too long to twist it. I was able to grab the waitress attention again for a knife which helped. The food was okay. I thought the noodles weren't cooked long enough. There was some chicken mixed in and believe me with all the noodles and not knowing I had a side salad spared me from ordering an appetizer I wanted to try. They were very filling. I did like the freshly cut and styled carrot it came with on top of the dish. I was pleased however that my check for everything was just slightly over $10.00.

The place is average size for one of your Southside restaurants. Street metered parking is available. In addition to curry and noodle dishes, they serve rice dishes, soups, and every entree gives you either tofu or vegetable topping if you don't care for meat. Located on 21st St near the Birmingham Bridge you are definitely in the heart of the Southside."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant. Great lunch specials and portions. Food is on the spicy side, but very good. Staff still new but was accommodating."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and made with love. If you can't tell, the rice served with the scallop and shrimp curry was presented in a heart shape. A plus in food taste and presentation. It's a quality restaurant in the South Side I do not want to lose. We ordered the shrimp and scallop in green curry sauce and pad se ew in spice 6 out of 10.  Perfect amount of heat for the both of us. The wonton soup served with the meal was noticeably rich in flavor compared to most bland versions. Hope more people come to support this restaurant. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"First, they refused to split checks because it was \"too much work for them\" (even though the place was almost empty on a Friday night at 7) and we only had 5 people which was annoying but we let it go. Then, when they asked for the level of spice- everyone got the hottest version of the dish or with absolutely no spice so almost half the dishes were sent back. Then to top it all off the server came up and told us we shouldn't even bother tipping him because the cash we left him \"wasn't enough for a tip\" which was a 15% tip which we thought was generous after our terrible service. Will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food at all. Husband and I walked in and sat down, there was nothing telling us to seat ourselves, wait, etc. There was one waiter who seemed to be doing everything, and he never even acknowledged us. It was almost as if he was making a point to avoid us. It was strange. Finally I said \"Excuse me?\" and he said he would be right with us. He came over and asked for our orders, and at this point I pointed out that we don't know yet, we haven't even gotten menus yet. He then tells me that he is the only one working --- ok...I get that, but then shouldn't he have known that we didn't have menus? We ended up leaving and going elsewhere. we may try again because of the good reviews, but it was a very strange encounter. If we try again I'll update the review."}
{"text":"Wandering around the street and got hungry so...why not? Pumpkin curry was really good, good balance of basil, pumpkin and peppers. And finally I found a place where you can order spicy and you really get spicy...not like others."}
