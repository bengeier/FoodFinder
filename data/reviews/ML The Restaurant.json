{"text":"ML was underwhelming, especially after reading a raving review in Cleveland Magazine. It is located in western Geauga County at the intersection of 306 and Washington. The first thing that struck me was the neon lights used for the sign, which are very ominous. They're so bright and large, that I missed it at first because I didn't think an upscale restaurant would use such a hideous neon sign. I did find it eventually after driving around the strip mall across the street. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice. The bar has plasma TV's that fit in really well. The service is what really brought down our experience here (it is so rare for me to complain about service as we usually have few problems where we go). It took 10-15 minutes for our menus to arrive, and another 15-20 minutes for our order to be taken. One nice thing the restaurant does is they give you a complimentary sample of something on their menu. While this is very nice, it was extremely small. It was so small that you barely tasted it, although whatever it was tasted good (I can't remember what it was). I'll come back to the service later. I ordered the Hawaiian Bigeye Tuna Trio for an appetizer and the Kobe beef and veal meatloaf for my main dish. The tuna was very good, although the portion was small. There were six thin slices total cooked in three different ways. Accompanying the tuna was two dips and a topping. To be honest, I can't remember the dips and the topping, as they aren't listed on the menu, courtesy of the website, but I remember one of the dips was funky. Everything else tasted great though. The meatloaf was phenomenal. It was one of the best meatloafs I've ever had. The kobe beef and the veal made it taste much better than your average meatloaf. There was a great mushroom sauce on top. The sides were mashed potatoes and squash with parmesan. The squash wasn't great, but it was good. The potatoes were great and went really well with the meatloaf. Back to the bad service. Our waiter was very aloof towards us while giving tons of attention to two other tables near us. He was borderline rude and was very slow. In fact, someone at my table got the wrong pizza than what she ordered. She let the waiter know about it and he didn't even try to fix it. He just played the blame game on the kitchen and let it go without even attempting to fix it, although she told him she was fine with it. We ended up leaving in a worse mood then when we came, which is a red flag for a restaurant. Overall, even though the food is really good, the crappy service ruins it. The food is the reason for the three stars. If the food wasn't so good, it would easily be one or two stars."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at ML once but I'm looking forward to returning soon. I had two specials - a truffle mac and cheese appetizer and a boar entree with ribs and tenderloin. The entree was served with a nicely spicy sauce and well prepared. The sides were well cooked and well seasoned. The appetizer was rich and creamy with perfectly cooked pasta. The house made apple tart for dessert was also very nice. If my father's pasta with spicy sausage was half as good warm as it was cold standing over the sink then it's some of the best pasta that I've ever had."}
{"text":"The simple storefront decor does not do the food justice, but on the plus side, the low overhead likely keeps cost down.

I dined here with a party of three, and it was clear that everything we ordered was prepared fresh. My dining companions raved about the pizzas, and the gnocchi appetizer was among the best of the Italian dumpling I've ever had. I told our waiter, \"Do me a favor. Whenever someone asks if s/he should get the gnocchi, tell them 'yes!'\"

Dinner for three with a shared appetizer, one glass of wine and tip was less than $100."}
