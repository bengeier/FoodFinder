{"text":"Stopped here for a snack while roaming the main drag in Vegas - candied bacon and cornbread app was delicious. The burnt ends and strawberry daiquiri....not so much. Burnt ends were not tender at all - ultimately inedible - and the daiquiri was out of one of those machines that are so popular on the strip, but it was so sweet and not enjoyable at all. Server was great, but likely will not return with all the other options!"}
{"text":"Such a cool environment, people working here are super rock stars really really nice !!! The food is amazing make sure to start with Pig Candy one of my favorite on the menu, then go for the Ribs those are pretty damn hot as well , amazing to see the chef coming to the table asking how was the food \"food is amazing\"  Over all this place is amazing is a must go when you in Vegas  !!"}
{"text":"Walking along on the strip and I was beckoned into a place I'd never heard of by a very inviting beer tub girl. Much to my surprise a very impressive country themed restaurant!?! On the Vegas Strip? Outstanding! My Texas heart felt right at home with great jambalaya that would give my mama's recipe a run for her money. Honky tonk vibe? CHECK! Great food? DOUBLE CHECK!! Even better drinks? TRIPLE CHECK!!! Inviting, informative staff? QUADRUPLE CHECK!!!! Just found my home away from home. My southern heart is now content! FYI, try the Cowgirl Kicker. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Never write reviews but have to say for this one, since when did bartenders start acting like they're above people and aren't they supposed to be social?  I came here for dinner with my friends and the food was good. Hostess was welcoming. Table server was friendly. Recommend the appetizer tower and the HUGE Double Barrel Burger.   However, after dinner we decided to stop by the bar and there was a girl and guy bartender. The girl was nice, blond, smiled at everyone. Unfortunately, we sat on the blond guy's section, he only waited on girls that came by and joked around with his bartender coworker. When we asked for a drink it seemed like it was a drag for him to take our order. Who's hired at this place? If you think your muscles are above everyone, go work at a Gold's Gym buddy, you're nothing special. Not coming here again.  So I rated two stars because of the outstanding negative service."}
{"text":"DINERS BEWARE, check your receipts before paying I got reports form another forum that diners have received their checks with 20% tip already added on.  These weren't large groups either, 2 to 4 persons and unknowingly more tip was given.  I'm not sure if these are only certain individuals or restaurant policy.  Management should look into this, tips should be left to the consumer to reward good service.  Fellow Yelpers, if you see this happening at any resturaunt, please post to warn others."}
{"text":"One star for the service and the cocktails.  If you want food, go elsewhere!  My boyfriend and I were excited to try this new place on the strip.  We ordered some large spiked iced tea's that were great.....then our food arrived.  We ordered the fried chicken sliders and when my boyfriend bit into one, it was raw in the middle.  We sent back the slider platter and asked to have bbq beef sliders instead, as there is no way he was trying chicken again.  When the beef sliders arrived, they were about 80% fat.  Not good fat either, but flabby, gelatinous fat.  We didn't eat them, asked for our bill and left.  We were not asked why we didn't eat the beef sliders and we were charged for them after they served us raw chicken.  I loved the cocktail, but that is not enough to go back."}
{"text":"Food was great! Yummy grilled chicken sandwich. Good prices and nice open air atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place for a little pre-game meal. This is at the Monte Carlo, so we went to this place before going to see the Blue Man Group. Food was great, but you just don't get that much. They also have a great SRO bar area. We went during March Madness, and they had TVs everywhere, so it was great."}
{"text":"The food was the best I had the brisket sliders and smoked wings and sweet potatoe fries the best also recived 20% off my tab for signing in with Yelp. Awesome sauce"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and courteous. The location is great and they play great variety of music. You can't go wrong with any burger on the menu. They are all fresh and made to order at your desired temperature. But you MUST, absolutely have to, order the garlic fries!!! They are so much better than Guy Fieri's with a ton of buttery garlic on each fry and the fries were perfectly fired. Would recommend this place to anyone. Ps...they have pool and a beer pong table and two big bars."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bartenders here are always fun and upbeat. Great drinks and great food. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork nachos and BBQ chicken lettuce wraps.  Food was good, but portions were extremely small for price.  Service was horrible.  Took 45 min to get bill at 4 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"We hopped into a cab from the Mirage to start at this end of the Strip. Whiskey sodas for him, whiskey on the rocks for me. I did end up falling on my butt because of some water on the wooden floor - that hurt and I still have the bruises and wounds on my feet - but they were good about it. The music is country, of course. There are two bars on two levels, with giant projection screens. Good place."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be great. Fantastic setting just on the strip, great outdoor seating area and a great looking vibe was what drew my girlfriend and I into Double Barrel. We were on the hunt for a quick drink and snack, so we decided to give it a shot.  Initially, we were greeted by a very pleasant blonde girl who welcomed us in and sorted us with a table, she was accommodating and got us one in the shade as requested. Had she been our server, this review may have merited a higher score.  Unfortunately, we were served by another guy (I believe someone referred to him as Bill, tall guy with dark hair) who was anything but pleasant. He wanted us in and out as quickly as possible. I was still looking at the drinks menu and he stood and loomed over me looking angry until I eventually settled on something I didn't even want because I felt so uncomfortable. Then, we decided to order food. At this point, the establishment really earned its 2 star review. I asked 'Bill' if it would be possible to get the sour cream and pico de gallo toppings on the side as I'm not a massive fan of either, but my girlfriend likes them. A fairly standard request I assumed. At this point I was told no as \"the kitchen doesn't like to do that\" or something to that effect. Probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I've literally never experienced this anywhere else. After this, 'Bill' delivered our nachos about 10 minutes later and they were underwhelming at best. They tasted microwaved and the cheese had the consistency of rubber. The chicken was sparse and for $17, I expected a hell of a lot better. At no point did anyone bother to check in with us to ask how the food was or if we would like another drink. 'Bill' eventually brought the check over and we settled up and left.  All in all a poor experience. The only reason for 2 stars rather than one would be the beer selection is good, if extortionate ($8 for a bottle of Dos Equis is daylight robbery)."}
{"text":"Went as a group- thought the menu was diverse enough and everybody gave positive reviews.  Yes it was a theme place but it turned out to be a bit more than that.  Be warned: while the bathrooms are separate, there is a common wash area, which for me introduced me to the concept of the sink and mirror not just a 45 second visit."}
{"text":"These guys get my 5 stars, the brisket is well cooked. My wife and i really loved bbq and conveniently off the  the strip.. Im sure there are other great spots but this one is great."}
{"text":"For the money they charge I shouldn't be told that a large majority of the beers they have on their list, that they are out of. Then after having to be limited on my choice of beverage, for the service to way less then excellent. If you can't serve me something I would like, you ought to at least go over the top on your service. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, cj and Sara are awesome!!!loved spending my birthday here!!!!!"}
{"text":"There were 4 of us and we stopped in for some drinks on a Friday afternoon. Service is so SLOW!! A good server knows that when your drink is almost gone, to stop by and ask if you'd like another, but apparently our server didn't know this and would just walk by our table when our drinks were empty and we would eventually have to flag him down. After our 2nd round we decided to go elsewhere which is a shame because the ambiance was good. We weren't eating which we think might have disappointed our server, but for the price of drinks, if he would've kept the service going he would've racked up a decent bill. His loss. We should've known after drinking 2 glasses of water provided by the busser before our server ever showed up to take our order."}
{"text":"Great location, high prices, forgettable food and service.  $150 for 4 at lunch.  Better value at the food courts.  You get the same quality food for much less money.  The ribs were terrible, dry, stringy and bland.  Probably safe to order a burger.  It is pretty hard to screw that up."}
{"text":"Our server was great and service was great! We came just in time to try the wings during happy hour and they were yummy! Brisket was more fatty than anticipated but the server was great and swapped it out for chicken."}
{"text":"Right on the strip next to Monte Carlo. Pretty open to the sidewalk if no weather issues and good place to do some people watching on late nights. Food, drinks, and service was great. Wasn't as busy as expected but kind of enjoyed that as I didn't feel crowded. Used the drink special card that they were passing out on the sidewalk. Kind of funny what the lady said to me when handing it to me, \"Don't worry, it's not the porn\"...lol."}
{"text":"Double Barrel is a fun place to go and get amazing snacks (BBQ pulled pork and brisket nachos and must get every time PIG CANDY with corn bread), yummy dessert (fried Twinkie), but our experience was topped off by having a fun knowledgeable bartender \"Johnny\".  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for an event for my husbands work. The food was great, and the drinks were really good. I had a Double Barrel Iced Tea. The food was served by the bite. We had the seasoned fries, pulled pork sliders, mac and cheese, crispy chicken sliders. All tasted great. The service was a bit slow, but that's probably because there were several people at this event."}
{"text":"Being Vegas regulars, we decided to forego one of our usual dining spots for dinner and try out the Double Barrel Roadhouse. That was a mistake unfortunately. The place is cool looking and the hostesses were very welcoming, but that is where the positives ended. Our server was a jerk who would go around the restaurant to not have to come by our table. At 35 minutes in, we finally stopped a busboy to inquire where our drinks were. The server came by 5 minutes later and said, \"I gave your beer to another table\". We had the sliders for an app - they were OK. For dinner - which came about an hour into our trip - we had the BBQ burger which my boyfriend liked and I had the fried chicken - \"one of their specialties\". It was horrible, tasteless and had a weird consistency. All in all, I was hoping for a new casual spot to eat, but never again. There is too much great food on the Strip."}
{"text":"Good food, extremely slow service , portions VERY small for the price. Here on a weeknight and service was severely lacking! Regardless...food was good."}
{"text":"Walked in this place because they gave me coupons off drinks.  It was very busy waited about 10 minutes for a table. The service was great, the nachos were sinful. I had a spinach salad with grilled chicken that was one of the best I have had. My husband loved the fried chicken.  But the best was the watermelon cocktail. Reasonable prices especially for Vegas where I found most places were overpriced."}
{"text":"Last night we went in and we had a wonderful time, as always Sylvia is like the best and Rick and Josh thank you for making us feel as welcome like family as that is how it should feel when you walk through the door.Anyone who comes to Las Vegas this is the place to go for great food and if Sylvia is working ask to sit in her section, she will make sure you are taken care of.Again , a great big shout out for the wonderful dining experience last night."}
{"text":"This place is a must-visit whenever I'm in Vegas! The Stacked BBQ is the best burger I've ever had, and the restaurant is a great location for people watching on the strip. The patio is a great place to catch a good meal and enjoy the Vegas ambience,  and our bartender Johnny provided great service, tasty drinks, and good conversation. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food, good variety on the menu. Service was good and the atmosphere was perfect for a Saturday afternoon. The prices were about what you would expect for the venue."}
{"text":"First night in Vegas, get to our hotel (Monte Carlo - Never again but that's another review) roughly 9:30 pm and all the restaurants are closing. Have to go elsewhere.   The Roadhouse is right outside the doors of the hotel so we figure we'll give it a try. We wanted to eat light so we ordered 4 appetizers for a party of 6 and we each started off with a beer.  The pulled pork sliders for $12 were two White Castle sized sandwiches (I know... that's what sliders are but only  2 for $12?1?! They were ok.  Next was the pulled pork and beef nachos for $19. Our server told us it was a huge portion. Not even close., they were were served in a 6\"x4\" casserole dish, I don't know where that classifies as huge. Anyway, not bad tasting overall but some of the meat was a little hard, as in dried out and old kind of hard.   The third appetizer was the grilled chicken nachos for $17 . Not very good at all. Served in the same mini dish.  The last was smoked chicken wings for $15. All 6 of them had a nice smoky flavor that was unfortunately destroyed by drowning them in straight up Franks Hot Sauce.  The finish off the night before we were done with our first beer they called last call.   I don't recommend this place at all. There has to be better food in Vegas. Even if the food was over priced, if it had been good quality this rating would be different. I recommend you look elsewhere if you like good food."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week while in town. Also went to Guy Fieri's and , between the two, would be back here again first.  Recently opened about a month ago. Love the open atmosphere overlooking the strip. It's on the west side of LVB (next to Mirage near Diablo's) not east side as the map shows. They've got TVs and a huge screen in the back for sports.  Ordered drinks, BBQ chicken lettuce wraps, nachos and chocolate stuffed cookies. Lettuce wraps were not really BBQ flavored, just grilled but the sweet sauce for them was great. Nachos were good and DID have BBQ and shredded beef in them. Tasty. But hands down the chocolate filled cookies were awesome! Came out hot and oozing chocolate. Save some room or just stuff 'em down.   Service was prompt, attentive and friendly. Everything came out fast and hot. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!!!!! THEY ARE SCAMMERS THAT WILL OVER CHARGE YOUR 38$ bill 300 dollars more!!!!! Only place I had a problem with in entire trip to Vegas. A fat gay Indian guy was are waiter we asked if the sampler tower would be enough for 4 people he smirked and said we could try it. After the platter came out it wasn't even enough for 2 people much less 4 people. Split the 76$ dollar bill 38$ each and gave a bad tip for terrible service. Check my bank account and THEY CHARGED the &78 5 times to my account over $350 in charges. Had too dispute it with my bank, and  a police report with LVPD. Contacted Better Bussiness Bureu too.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE"}
{"text":"Prime location on the strip and priced accordingly.  Food was good and portions were large, but $21 for a burger and $7 for a bottle of beer was still too high for outdoor dining.  Waitress was friendly, but very little customer service as they seemed more interested in getting us in and out rather than giving us an enjoyable dining experience.    Too many other good places on the strip to enjoy for the price we paid, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by double barrel while playing tourist for a quick drink on our way down the strip. What started as one drink, quickly led into quite a few. The bartenders were attentive even while the bar was packed, and not to mention,  very easy on the eyes.(both myself and my wife agreed) We decided on the appetizer tower which was 5 appetizers for a very reasonable price. The smoked chicken wings were my favorite with the pulled pork quesadilla coming in hot in second place. The manager (I think her name was Whitney?) was great and made sure everything was top notch. As a local I rarely frequent the strip, but we will definitely be back for this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of nine and they were very accommodating!  We grabbed a seat at the outside bar and ordered a few beers to start. I only tried the fries and fried pickles but they were amazing! Bar food done right."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view. I chose to give this a poor rating because of the servers attitude. The girl who brought our food out had MAJOR attitude problems. Our waitress also checked on us once only after we asked another employee of her where abouts. Leaving for home tomorrow, frequent Vegas quite often. More than likely will not return or suggest."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this out this weekend. The pulled pork sandwich was really good but the grilled cheese was pretty much flavorless. It needed something more to give it that final kick. The sweet potato fries were also soggy instead of crisp. This place is new and seems like they still have a few bugs to work out.   The service was ok but it took forever for us to get our drinks and for our initial visit from our waitress."}
{"text":"Awesome staff!! Bartenders off the charts! Had the smoked wings that make you drool! Great location! Special shout out to j-money! Love you guys! Thanks so much Cadillac Eddie's for my drinkable Mexican rice! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing.  The best bbq pork and beef nachos are here!  My husband and I came here had a couple of drinks and enjoy the food. Josh the manager has an awesome team."}
{"text":"The stars are only for the Mac and cheese!!! It is amazing!!!!! We came party of 7 to eat some steak and we get there and after waiting 20 min to be acknowledged the server says there is no steak. Then says there is some but just arrived and won't be ready because has to be prepped. Food came pretty fast but when the check came we were told we couldn't use our drink tickets they give us the door because a plate we ordered that was a special in the table was already used. No 2 promotions!? I'm buying ur daily special and u won't take my drink coupons because of it? After maybe 40 min trying to fix the check she comes back and like magic wuala it was done! If u go there be ready to wait long and try the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Five stars for quick service and delicious bbq. We enjoyed the St Louis ribs and the beef brisket. Our server was right on top of things and the staff all were very attentive. Highly recommended. The garlic fries are amazing as well."}
{"text":"We went because the concierge told us they had the best BBQ around. My wife and the other other couple are southerners, so naturally they know BBQ. Well, this place had great service...O wantrd to tru a combo, but they don't offer it.  The manager agreed to let me have a half rack and a serving of beef brisket for price of a full rack. I chose garlic fries as my one side dish. Later I added Cole slaw.  Food arrived hot and the fries were outstanding. My wife nibbled on my fries along with her Cobb Salad. I liked the cornbread muffin, it had corn mixed into the batter...nice chewy touch...but they are not worth $4 for two. You get one with your meal...no butter offered, just the muffin. It is moist, but legit cornbread is served warm so it goes with butter. The coleslaw...no way, it was soggy, watery and had zero flavor...it tasted like it had been stored open in the fridge after being left at room temperature too long. I sent them back after two mini taste tests.  The ribs? Too fatty and under seasoned. I took the remainder back to the hotel for a late snack, wish I had my own sauce.   The ambience is super, but the food is a 5 out of 10 for me. Upgrades would be those mentioned already, and a variety of BBQ sauces (sweet, spicy, tangy). Maybe a vinegar based Cole slaw, too...the cream based one is not impressive. By comparison Famous Dave's BBQ may not be as upscale and doesn't lend itself to the sports crowd...but the food is lights out better and they offer combinations which let you explore the variety of offerings.  Double Barrell needs to up their game. I gave it a 3 star, based on service and potential."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant is ideal because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip (the important parts, anyway). Very easy to find.   My travel-mate and I were seated pretty quickly and served just as quick. Our waiter, Will, who was freaking hilarious, made us want to stay the whole night drinking and eating. He made the atmosphere so much fun and please don't come for me for saying this but he made the experience more much Vegas-ey. About 4 hurricanes and 6 shots later we retreated to our next bar. Thanks for the experience, Will. See you next year!   Also, can you send me the recipe for your chicken nachos?"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the service staff was great. But the food was not good and the drinks were just so-so. We went in around 6pm the last week of March 2016 and the restaurant was pretty slow. We ordered our food (BBQ half rack of ribs and BBQ chicken breast) and the food literally came out in 6 mins from our order. How do you cook these items in 6 mins?? The food came out luke warm and not at all tasty. The food was definitely pre-made and just warmed up upon order. I would spend a little extra money and go somewhere that will serve you freshly cooked food."}
{"text":"Our service here was so-so.  Server had trouble either hearing exactly what was ordered or just didn't care.  Had a couple issues with the wrong number of items or the wrong item.  The food we had was great though, hence the 4 star review.  If you try  one item here make sure you get the lettuce wraps, un-fricken-real how good they are!  They quesadilla was pretty dang good as well. The open air dining made for a great ambiance and definitely a great perch for people watching!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. It's $30 all you can drink but you can't get red bull in a mixed drink. Only get beer because they water down the hard liquor. Took a shot of fireball and vodka, both went down like water. The bar upstairs refuses to give out shots if you have all you can drink, so it's ridiculous. I ordered a drink and saw the bartender go to the other side of the bar, talk to the other bartender while pointing at me and laughing while pouring my drink. When I got the drink (vodka soda water) it tasted like straight water. This place is a rip off and not worth the time or money. Take your business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come to Double Barrel Roadhouse. Not only is the food amazing and the bartenders, especially Johnny, are great but they have live bands....this place I would recommend to all friends and family....Tell Johnny Anthony Harvey sent you and enjoy...."}
{"text":"This place sucked pretty sure the waitress ripped us off and billed us twice and then when she did finally bring us the bill it had a $50 tip that she gave to herself when we called out about it she gave us a song and dance about how the cashier must have rang it up wrong but never gave us any new receipt or made any attempt to change it took my credit card swiped it came back to the table said it didn't work and then took my partner's card and overcharged his I immediately checked my card when we left there and it was fine I'm pretty sure this waitress billed us twice for an already expensive meal I would avoid this place like the plague another colleague of mine had a business meeting there with a group of people in town for a trade show and had a similar experience"}
{"text":"Loved the drink, wings, and service! Bill J. was our waiter and he handled business! Stopped for a quick drink. Bill J. and the cocktails convinced us to stay for more and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was bad. Food was good but expensive for what it was.  First I have to state this is a visit from a trip several months ago. I left here really irritated... told myself I would wait and probably not write a review but im still irritated about the service. We go to LV twice a year for 4 days and really go after the food there.  We decided to go here because the menu looked awesome, we love bbq regardless of how authentic and we were staying at the hotel. I am pretty picky for starters so I always scope out a menu and make sure I read the full descriptions of anything I order so there are no surprises.  I ordered the brisket sandwich I want to say it was around $20 but it sounded awesome. When I got it I checked it and there was mayo all over it. I tried to stop the waiter and tell him I didn't see mayo listed on the menu when I ordered it, showing him my sandwich. He said its queso and kept walking. He didn't come back for awhile. I sat there wondering what kind of queso is this? Why would they put queso on a brisket sandwich? And then finally this obviously isn't queso... did he even look? He finally came back awhile later after I had been sitting there and hadn't touched my sandwich. I had to level with him and say look this isn't queso, this time I actually got him to look at it. He took the food and came back to say that the chef had just started adding garlic mayo to it and that is why it wasn't on the menu. He brought me another one a little bit after that, nothing more to it, no apology or anything off the bill. That whole ordeal took a long time... then after we were about 3/4 through our meal my girlfriend went to the bathroom a bus boy came over and in 1 motion picked up our plates, said all done here and walked away. It definitely was not a question. When she got back from the bathroom she asked wheres our food...  This is the only restaurant I will not go back to because of the service."}
{"text":"25minutes to get water, 15 more to tell me they were out of mint for mint juleps, laughter when asked if they had a gluten free menu, when my salad came out it was slimy, they left it on the table through the meal.  No dishes were cleared from the table. They were aware we are locals and this WAS one of out favorite places.   So sad to say that another restaurant in Las Vegas has been taken off our list.  Service is everything."}
{"text":"Horrible. Luke warm beer and horrible service. We are here on a Friday at 4pm and the staff see unhappy and management is no where to be found. Never making the mistake by stopping here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, entertainment and food provided by J-Money and TeaBag! Will definitely stop back by to have some shots"}
{"text":"Looked like a cool place with good atmosphere.  Started off by waiting for a seat on the patio because we had seen the sign that said Happy Hour on the Patio 5-7pm.  There were many open tables on the patio but had to wait because there was only one waitress.  Once seated I ask what drinks are part of happy hour and waitress said that's at the bar inside only not the patio.  I walk over to hostess and turned around the sign for her and pointed toward where I was sitting and asked is where I'm sitting considered the patio and she said yes.  Then I asked why does the sign say happy hour on the patio 5-7pm and she only apologized but could not explain why.  Ok so I'm over that part now we order. I had brisket and sweet potato fries and my wife had pulled pork sandwich.   The brisket was a few slices that look like it came from a swanson TV dinner (if you remember those) and was the worst brisket I had ever had. Plus it was 24 bucks.  The pulled pork was dry and bland.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the sweet potato fries were awesome and the waitress looked like Jessica Biel.    One last thing.   A couple of ladies were seated near us but got up and left when waitress said happy hour is NOT on the patio.  Their web site even has happy hour from 3-7pm on the patio.  Look it up if you don't believe me.  This is from website: Monday - Thursday Happier hour beer and shot specials on the patio from 3PM - 7PM."}
{"text":"The exclusive release of Chris Kael's stout was enough to rate the 5 but the pulled pork and sweet potato fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"Walking along the strip we decided to stop in this pretty happening place.  Food was delicious, especially the burnt ends.  Customer service was awesome as well.  Going back here again for MOOOOOORE!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but the server struggled with splitting the bill into three. Ended up overcharging one of our credit cards."}
{"text":"They have changed their menu since the last time we were here. Not for the better in my opinion. No more brisket . Now they're just like every other restaurant on the strip. What we ordered was good, especially the Mac n Cheese, but we will try someplace else the next time we are at T-Mobile."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here but this place is my new must stop while in Vegas. Everything we've tried has been awesome."}
{"text":"At first, I wanted to award 3 stars: Food was okay but nothing special, it was overpriced but then again, this is Vegas. I ordered my steak \"well done\" but it came more \"medium-wellish\". The straw that broke the camel's back was that the waitress did not bring any change nor had she asked me whether I wanted change although I had given  more than 25%, she just took an extra 4% for herself. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place and visited a few times. Last here 6 weeks ago but was still recognised by the staff on my return. From the hostesses, to the bus-boys to the servers everything is what I would call \"5 star roadhouse\". The atmosphere is completely different day and night, patio or inside, so visit more than once. Ask for Rachel or Sarah as your server and you are guaranteed great service that really makes you feel appreciated."}
{"text":"8 of us stopped in for some appetizers & were quickly seated inside the bar as the patio was packed.  We had the DB wing tower & brisket sliders.  Both were very good & hit the spot. Good service & atmosphere.  We will have to try a full meal next time."}
{"text":"This place is simply AMAZING.  They have the best ribs I have ever tasted.  The bacon wrapped oysters were awesome too.  We tried it out because of a MyVegas reward, we loved it so much that every time we go to Vegas, we make it a must to stop here.  The portions are big and so are the drinks.  Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"My bro Steve love the macaroni and cheese and the quesadillas the rib fried chicken the biscuit awesome please and to play Axl Rose"}
{"text":"Great menu, wonderful staff! We sit at the bar when we come in. Totally addicted to their macaroni and cheese!! Best we have had on the strip. Great place to have a beer and watch the game(s)."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here after walking the strip looking for something other than a chain or overpriced burger place.  Probably should have looked at the menu first. It's basically an over priced faux barbecue place.   The highs...our server was great. Attentive without being over bearing and even corrected a wrong drink order.  The food was delivered quickly after ordering and was cooked as requested (rare burger!). The food was good, not the best ever, and the beer selection was ok bud could use some local brews. The lows...getting a $75 bill for a burger, salad, extra order of sweet potato fries and two drinks.   There are lots of TVs and it's probably a go to place on game days. I would be willing to try it again if I had some of the 2 for 1 or that 20% off for Yelp deal."}
{"text":"First of all they have the best food EVER!!! The bartender was knowledgeable about the beers they serve and what is similiar to popular culture to the mosr discriminant taste. My bartender wa Jess was amazing. Music was pop like. Need more Rock Music to fit the theme. Best Damn Chicken BBQ Wrap i have ever had. PERIOD. Friendly and Family atmosphere. Outside is the best."}
{"text":"Food was good, very expensive and the service was awful! The host rolled her eyes when we asked to be seated outside. When our server came over he was also extremely rude and didn't seem knowledgable about their menu and the glasses were dirty. They didn't bring our food out until we had to ask our waiter where it was since tables around who were seated after us were getting their food. He then said I don't know let me go look. He brought our food after that. The food was very good. When we asked for our check to be split the waiter was also upset about it. And on top f it all our waiter assisted us with sunglasses on the entire time we were there. Rude. I would never recommend anyone to visit this establishment."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks nice and presents food well,however overall bad service and not so good food. Would not recommend. Asked for 2 things during our dinner and waitress and bus boy did not bring it. Steak was not done correctly and very charred on outside   Overall bad experience and not worth it."}
{"text":"The service was awesome and the food was great but you better hungry because you get lots of food."}
{"text":"Great service.  Thanks Chris.  Beef and pork nachos. . . Awesome.  Sweet potato fries are the best we've had across the country.  Thanks DB crew for a great dinner."}
{"text":"First we came in from the cold and told the hostess that we were a party of three and super cold so we asked to be sat away from the open doors; she said  it would be around 20 minutes for a warmer spot.... she sat us right next to the front door.... unbearable.... we moved ourselves to the bar... still cold but we decided to stay anyways. Casey the bartender was super chill and nice. We ordered the burger Med rare it came well done and dry, no BBQ sauce. Also the Mac n Cheese was nothing special, bland really; shrimp and salad on the lite side were fine definitely not worth $27 but it is the strip so we expected high prices, just maybe better food."}
{"text":"I would give this more stars if they didn't tax the hell out of everything. The Nachos were different (had a bbq sauce on it) BUT VERY YUMMY and huge. We had a few  beers and this place is huge. We came in late night so sat up close to the stage on the top floor.. band was good and entertaining. We really liked the place until we got our $50 something bill and noticed $23 tax added to it.. There was a service tax, entertainment tax, food tax.. totaling about $23on $50 something bill.. WTH is all that?  If they get rid  of all that extra hidden charges we will be back.. otherwise Never again.. plenty of other fun places to go too. Needless to say we were shocked.. There were only 2 of us too for about 1 1/2 hours.."}
{"text":"We needed to grab a meal before Blue Man group and were not disappointed.  The prices are high but portions are generous so consider splitting entrees.  Décor was cool and lots of TVs to watch sports on."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The staff is great, food is quality BBQ and music is good. The BBQ brisket is excellent."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came for dinner before we went out on the strip, and the food and service was exceptional! Our server Brian took great care of us!!! We will definitely be back for the sweet potato fries! Fun environment on a Friday night as well. Thanks Double Barrel!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot! Live music and more. Easy access and a lot of fun. Right off the strip and will satisfy what you're looking for. Amazing food and more. Beer pong beer bong and lots of fun. With live entertainment."}
{"text":"Food was good, had the chicken Sammie my husband had the brisket sliders and we shared the Mac and cheese! Would come back for the food again. Your usual vegas screen came during the day so the crowd was good. The service was not great our waiter clearly didn't want to be at work and had no customer service...."}
{"text":"Their are a few times in life when you are served a perfect meal at a perfect table by a great waitress. We sat in the bar area ordered brisket tacos and pig candy. It was all wonderful. I never give 5 stars. I had to this time. In a packed inviornment they made room for us quickly serving hot delicious food cold drinks in a very timely manner with lots of smile's. You have to go see cat."}
{"text":"Well, if my wife and I would have been served by the long haired blonde server working at 1:15 pm today, I could have written a review. Unfortunately, she never bothered to ask for our order after waiting a long time and watching her serve others around us. Note to \"Blondie\" in the cowgirl attire: my money is as green as anyone else's and I would have been a good tipper. Guess I will be going to Rollin Smoke  BBQ instead. Vegas! I still love you. 1 star only because I need it to post this review."}
{"text":"Great location! Hostess didn't seem like she wanted to be there but the bar tenders were very nice. Food was very disappointing. Great for people watching..."}
{"text":"Cool vibes, nice atmosphere, decent food. The appetizers are big enough to split between two people."}
{"text":"Food is great. . Service sucks.. waited 10 minutes. . No waitress. .had to get up and ask for one. .. hostess came over and took our order.   Brought our drinks and disappeared. .. I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for sugar for my ice tea. .5 minutes later got up again to ask for more ice tea at the bar. .. NO WAITRESS. .. Got our food.. no one came by to see if we needed anything. .. had to ask the bus boy for the check. .10 minutes later. . No check so I got up and went to the hostess and paid my check there. ...a lot of apologies but we didn't even get a discount. Got charged full price for this shitty service. .she didn't even bay an eye when she gave me the check. ..  2 stars. . And that's because the food was good... service Sucked ass..."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place but it just didn't happen.  Great decor and wonderful location. Got a seat right up front which was great for people viewing which we did a lot of while we wanted an overly long time for our meal.   Drinks were ok. Mine was wrong.   Fried chicken was not good.  Far too much breading on tiny pieces of chicken. The chicken was served in a GIANT contraption that totally blocked the view of our dinner companions sitting across from us. When we were done no one bother to clear our plates or take the behemoth serving sculpture away. When I asked for it to be removed, the waitress just looked at me, smiled and said I wish I could, and walked off.   Luckily Hodor later came to pick it up. He had made regular appearances throughout the night to spill water and food on us every single time he came to the table.   What a shame.  Far too many other great places to eat to try this one again.  However, if you are determined to give it a try, do it quick - I can't see this place being around for too long."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the staff was better. Would recommend everyone go here. Will go back again next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very yummy and a great view! I got the double barrel burger and it was very yummy! The double barrel sauce was different but still very good! We also got the big drinks in the tall glasses. The lime margarita machine was out but our waitress suggested using the strawberry mix with tequila instead. VERY YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Maybe its me but Vegas has a lot of clean, comfortable and simple restaurants. I like how the bar and table are arranged. You have many seating choices. The food is fresh and what surprised me was how good the food was, especially the ribs. The bartenders, hostess and wait staff are excellent."}
{"text":"I went out to dinner this past Saturday night and we all decided to go to Double Barrel. A few of us had been past the restaurant many times and it smelled of delicious barbecue. We got to the restaurant around 6:30 and they told us it would be around a thirty minutes to get a table for six. We weren't able to have our party of six sit outside together due to code. In the mean time we had drinks at the outside bar. Not that familiar with the bar, we ordered beer and margaritas. Without asking rocks, with salt, etc. slushy margaritas were sitting in front of us AND with no salt. Not the service we expected at a nicer strip restaurant. It was around fifty minutes later that we actually sat at the table. We ordered appetizers and dinner. (Hot wing tower with garlic fries was amazing.) The rest of us ordered ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Pulled pork was by far the best. Brisket was only mildly smokey and very, very tough. Ribs were mediocre and tough as well. Definitely not fall off the bone barbecue deliciousness.   Bottom line, if you want barbecue, don't go to Double Barrel. If you want appetizers and expensive drinks, it's your place  Customer service was decent. Although with a party of six they tacked on automatic gratuity. The waitress failed to mention this AT ALL. I wish I could take back my tip just because of this. Like a lot of Vegas restaurants they prey on drunk tourists. I wish though, seeing that we were locals, the waitress would have been a little more courteous and informed us of their tipping policy.  If you are looking for amazing brisket and ribs, try Fox's BBQ in Boulder City. (Their pork isn't very good.) If you want good pulled pork. Try it Memphis style at Lucille's BBQ in Henderson."}
{"text":"Server was awful!!! Although food was great! I didn't get any \"is everything okay?\" Do you need any thing?  Also, I showed the server my check in on Yelp she said we no longer offer this 20% off bill. This is false advertisement and  should be removed. My server was young blonde girl. Please fire her no skills!!!!"}
{"text":"Kat is amazing.  Food was awesome.  This is my favorite place on the strip.  Prices are not low but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to be with friends and family. I got here on a Saturday at 10pm and their was plenty of room to sit. Enjoy the live music and the DJ playing great Latin hits!"}
{"text":"Awesome venue with a live band! Had the nachos which were awesome. Also the sliders looked bomb. Great crowd and definitely a place to stop by, play beer pong, eat great food, and listen to some live music....."}
{"text":"Great TVs for watching the final game of the World Series, but mediocre food and bad service.  Everywhere you look there is a tv in view, so no chance to miss any action. Unfortunately the servers are inattentive and did not come to the table often to check up on us. When my order was finally taken, I ordered the BBQ chicken breast, it came as a mixed bag. Of the two fillets on the plate, one was tender and juicy and the other was way over-cooked. Dry and hard. Overall Not the best choice for casual Vegas dining..."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in Double Barrels service.  My order was wrong and my husband's order was under cooked.  Once the food was delivered we never saw our server again until he brought the check.  Our plates had already been taken away by the bus boy before he ever stopped back.  Unfortunately we had tickets to see Cher and didn't have time to wait to speak to the manager.  When I told the server about the issue he said, \"Oh sorry\" and walked off.  Of the food that was correct on my plate it was just ok."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The brisket burger was to die for and their garlic & sweet potato fries are one of the best basket of fries I've ever had. We redeemed out my Vegas points and got $20 off our meal. Scccccoooorrre. I'd come back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The best bartender is Jmoney cash money! He recommended some great whiskey I never tried called bullet. I recommend this place to anyone. And some biscuits bomb biscuits."}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to check out this new place last night for a soft opening.  I believe they officially open this weekend.  Good food, good vibe, and a very friendly staff.  As far as food, the highlight of the meal was the BBQ Chicken Lettuce Wraps...awesome, a must try.  We also tried the ribs, the salmon and few sides (great mac n' cheese).  All were very good and had a great presentation.  I will definitely be back to try more when they are officially open.  They are set up for live music but didn't have a band playing on this night, however they have a great sound system with a DJ that made for a fun atmosphere.  Above the dining area is a grated catwalk which has a staff of dancers who periodically do a routine right above you.  It's a perfect set up for a place right on the strip.    A useful side note...there currently isn't an entrance from the Monte Carlo Casino.  To get to it, just walk out to the strip, the only access is from Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for a couple cocktails & an appetizer. It took an extremely long time for the food to come out but it was worth the wait. Had the BBQ pork quesadilla.....probably the best I've ever had. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the bartenders are jerks!! They think they're all that and a bag of chips! They should be fired because they're bringing down your business! We went for lunch on Friday for a girls trip and had several drinks per person and food - spent well over $120.00. A friend asked them for a water to go as we were leaving and they said we were boring as if we're in Vegas and we're not drinking at 2pm which we were (not in a nice way!) and was like \"I don't think so sweetheart\"....hello?! how rude! When I'm in Vegas, I'll never go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Jesus... my boyfriend had to chase down a waiter after waiting to be served for like 45 minuets. Not great service js"}
{"text":"We were there around midnight and all of the staff were really cool.  Gave great service and when the DJ kicked in the place was high energy.  Good times and will definately go back soon."}
{"text":"Went with 8 people, our server Ted was awesome. Chicken and salads were very tasty. They are handing out drink tickets in the front (read the fine print) that do not cover any drinks over 13 dollars...only disappointment."}
{"text":"It is located next to Monte Carlo hotel. They have seats near the street and you can enjoy the view of strip. Food is good and price is decent. The discount 20% off is accepted. Nice to have a rest and enjoy the food here when you feel tired to walk around the strip."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here with a group of 4, and we were all very satisfied. We were initially brought in by the Pokemon Go promotion they were running (free t-shirts with a $25 purchase), and after receiving our meals, we were glad we chose the Double Barrel! The food was all great, but most notably, the fried chicken and cornbread was INCREDIBLE. To top off the excellent meals, our waitress, Nicole, was attentive and kind, and made it a great experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service.... Worse food. Server offered a\"generic\" salad with an entree. I'll warn my friends and will never come back...I must say that the manager was the best part about this place"}
{"text":"Double Barrel Roadhouse in Las Vegas has been the best experience.  Especially with J-CASH Money!!!!"}
{"text":"Bekah was the best  hostess. Even on a packed PAC12 final game night she got us seated quickly with a smile and warmth. She recommended the ribs and they were yummy. Our waiter was friendly and came back and checked on us just the right amount. We will definitely be coming back. Cheers kay!! :)"}
{"text":"Sucked!!! service was horrible! prices are high. We sat there for 15 mins and never saw a waitress. The hostess was rude. We won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I should say this is definitely my most favorite bar in vegas with amazing drinks, food, and fun bartenders."}
{"text":"I actually really liked Double Barrel Roadhouse -- it's open-air atmosphere mixed with a bit of country, a bit of high end and a lot of alcohol made this a fun place.   Service was super slow, but bar service was great.   I got a taco salad and it was TOO FREAKIN SPICY, as in, inedible mouth on fire spicy. I had to ask for ranch dressing to smother the thing so I could eat it, which totally defeated the purpose of getting salad to begin with. Disappointment. My drinks were pretty good but inconsistent -- some were strong, some were weak, meh.  Everything else was delicious, so I think I just chose a poor item on the menu for my taste. I would definitely come back on my next trip to Vegas because we had a blast and most of the food was good. Just know what to order and where to sit."}
{"text":"Came into Double Barrel this evening for a quick bite, ended up sticking around for all the great entertainment.  First there was Jeremy James, great solo act, followed  by Nicole Kerns and the Midnight Express. Phenomenal sound and mix of music.  Back to the reason I came, dinner.  I was greeted by Victorious Victoria, what a tremendous personality, made the night memorable.  She rattled off everything on the menu as if she wrote it and made awesome suggestions.  Started with the Hot Links Plate, followed by the Wood Fired Prawns and ended with the Deep Fried Twinkies! All were on the mark and full of flavor.  Robert, the Manager, stopped by and checked on me and made me feel welcomed.   Great energy in the room and the staff had plenty of southern hospitality."}
{"text":"When I saw this place I didn't expect anything above and beyond mediocre food but seriously everything was great.  The brisket potato skins...Woo wee.  Loved the cilantro cream dipping sauce.  My bourbon glazed salmon sandwich was super as was the mac and cheese.  Cornbread?  Probably the best sweet cornbread I have ever tasted.  St. Louis Ribs, according to the hubs, were good.  How can I forget the Tito's mule I ordered.  Sit outside under the misters and ask to play the large game of Connect Four.  Bartenders were great and their service was even better."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be amazing, and I'll tell you the food looked amazing it just didn't taste as good.   We came here for dinner and drinks and had a nice waiter who must have had a few too many customers to handle, we waited about 20 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. While we waited though we had some great conversation and enjoyed looking around the bar and people watching.   We ended up ordering some beers and we were really thrilled that they had Stiegl Grapefruit Radlers here- it's a fantastic beer for the hot Vegas weather.   While the drinks were great, we ended up ordering the barrel fried chicken to share after we saw the really cool barrel serving tray they use to display the meal. The chicken came out and smelled amazing, unfortunately it ended up being more breading and fat than chicken. The fries and biscuits were great, but we ended up avoiding the chicken.   I want to say I'd give this restaurant another try, but with so many options in Vegas I think I'll pass, unless I want another refreshing radler."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend and received great service! The bartenders were all very welcoming and friendly. They all made great cocktails. The live band was great and I loved their music."}
{"text":"I took a small getaway and went to Las Vegas last week. I got a great deal at the Montecarlo, they built a lot of restaurants and after seeing some yelp reviews and pictures this place caught my eye.  I ordered a spinach salad and it was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. It was topped with a white balsamic vinaigrette, manchego cheese, blueberries and huge candied pecans. It was so light and perfect. Hubby ordered a salmon plate that came with mashed potatoes and a biscuit. I ate some of his food and the biscuit was my fave. I wanted to order more and smother them with butter but I decided not to. I did not check in until I left because my internet was acting up. I noticed there was a 20% discount when you checked in. Bummer!  Since the food was yummy and they offered a discount, I decided to go back the next day and I ordered the chicken nachos and hubby ordered a chicken sandwich with garlic fries as the side. Nachos were good enough for 3 people. I couldn't even finish half so hubby helped me out and took the sandwich to go. Garlic fries were yummy, they are smothered in garlic and chives.  The food is awesome, prices are great, service is top notch. Definitely a must try in Vegas. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best nachos ive ever had fully loaded and stuffed mushrooms to die for. Lettuce wraps are Fab too dont have a bad word to say about this place"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant on the Strip!  The swordfish and collards were amazing.... Awesome beer selection, with a 32oz \"mug\" as the way to go!  The staff was among the best in Vegas!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in at around 5pm on Sunday, and there was a large football crowd.  Lots of TVs showing lots of different games. Inside was pretty crowded, but we were able to get a nice seat on the patio.  The bartender didn't skimp on his pours in our drinks and the food was very good. I ordered the pulled pork nachos and they were fabulous. Definitely enough for two people to share. Overall, this was a great place."}
{"text":"Met an friend new to LV here, his recommendation....    Quite surprised actually, n a good way! I arrived about noon was promptly greeted and show to a table and then the hostess checked that her decision was good, it was actually I loved it. I could see the entire restaurant and outside.    Quickly our server showed up with water asked about drinks, cocktails and or appetizer selections~ I did explain that I was waiting for someone so I needed to wait.    We did finally order ~ myself the Bourbon Salmon Sandwich and while I didn't eat the bread the salmon  was cooked perfectly for my tastes and instead of the fries which I have NEVER met a potato I haven't likes I tried the Mac N Cheese. Yes! There was an uncharged but really if a couple Buck is gonna take me to the poor house I shouldn't be out. The Mac was OUTTA SITE. Cheesy wonderfulness and could tell it was freshly made with a DEELISH CRISPY CRUST on top.....     My friend, Dave knows the pastry chef for the Monte Carlo, Leyla she stopped by with the chef, Luis both just deliteful she sent over dessert!!!! OH DEAR LORD! S'More flavored ice cream, with a layer of fudge & graham cracker bottom crust like with a chocolate swirl decoration attached to the side going above the dessert about 2/3 inches. Really SPECTACULAR to look at and the NICEST part???? It TASTED BETTER THAN IT LOOKED!!!!      Lots of burgers passed by & ribs all looked FAB!!!! I think the dinner/cocktail crowd could get rowdy as the country music is playing loud but HEY! it's VEGAS BABY!"}
{"text":"FRAUD ALERT! MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR RECEIPT AFTER YOU LEAVE!  Hi Double Barrel! Thank you for the horrible service you provided this weekend (scratch that... we received NO SERVICE!)! AND! For changing the amount on the receipt. I checked my credit card this morning, and was shocked that I had paid more than what I agreed to. I tried calling to rectify the situation, but got the run around instead. Judging by your reviews online, this doesn't look like I'm the first person this has happen to.... I hope you realize this is fraud."}
{"text":"I agree with a previous reviewer that Double Barrel is like an upscale sports bar. I'll even go one further to say an upscale sports bar with a country twist. Double Barrel has all the offerings of a bar, plus a country style restaurant and PLENTY of tvs to catch your teams playing on.   I've been to Double Barrel twice but most recently for a company team outing. I will say this up front, the menu is a little more pricey than I would expect - however you do get what you pay for (quality). If you're on a budget, skip DB for now.   Service was good, our server checked on us often and made sure that we were taken care of. I got to try the sliders, wings and nacho appetizers. The nachos were OK, but those sliders and wings? SENSATIONAL. We ordered the bbq wings and they had the perfect amount of crisp and the sauce to wing ratio was spot on. They tasted fresh off of a grill. How can I think this? Because a few days prior I had wings that were fresh off a grill. The sliders were ALMOST as good as the wings... there was a bit more bread involved than I would have liked... I don't particularly enjoy when the bun swallows the burger.. but they were still really tasty.   For my entree I had the Apple wood Bacon & Salmon Sammie... SO FILLING BUT SO GOOD! I could not finish it, but I really wanted to. I did not see that the garlic aoli (at least it looked like that?) came on the sandwich, so I ended up wiping that off as much as I could... whatever was left though complimented the salmon... so maybe next time I will leave it be. The bacon was cooked with brown sugar or maple syrup one... either way, super delicious. I also had the garlic fries as a side and I felt that they complimented the sandwich well.   If you find yourself on the south end of the strip looking for a filling lunch or dinner, look no further - Double Barrel to the rescue! I will provide an update after I've gotten a chance to explore the bar atmosphere during one of their Tuesday night karaoke sessions."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 30 for a set menu event. It was hit or miss food, with excellent (EXCELLENT) service.   First, about that service. If you've been to Vegas you know how much water is required to feel normal even if you have not a drop of booze. The desert, yo! They kept my water glass full at all times, and I was so grateful. Keeping the water coming is one of my service markers, but it's something I've learned to pretty much give up on in Vegas. They were SO good about it here, we couldn't thank the server enough. He was working hard to keep all our glasses full and we all really appreciated it and told him so. Seriously, the water pitcher came by every few minutes. We were blown away (made my dehydration headache disappear!). Our other server was a doll: attentive, friendly, genuinely warm without the Vegas 'tude that seems so ubiquitous.   The food was okay. It was a set menu, as I said, and we had smoked chicken lettuce wraps (a little dry, but tasty!), smoked chicken cobb salad (okay! Would be a decent healthy-ish Vegas option for a main), BBQ chicken (okay, but not great. A bit dry, and I think there was cumin in the rub which is not my jam), garlicky fresh green beans (good!), and creeeeamy dreamy mac & cheese (GOOOOOD. Still thinking about it.). Oh, and cornbread (Okay. Sweet, tasted oddly like a blueberry muffin without the blueberries. I know that sounds weird but when I said it to my friends they were all like 'yes! that's it!'). One of the vegetarians in the group had a veggie burger and when I asked her how it was she said \"Eh. It's a veggie burger.\". The fries looked good though ;)  All in all, some hits and some misses. With the great staff and prime location this might be a good spot for people watching with a drink and a snack on the patio!"}
{"text":"Miserable  First off we made a reservation for 2 at 7. Got there 705. Had to wait 10 mins for our table.  But they weren't busy and we could see half the place was empty  Drinks - of the 8 or so draft beers,  two were kicked. And beer choice was bad. Got a white ale served in a dirty glass.  Food - looked at menu and could only find one or two \"bbq\" options.  Bailed before we even ordered given how poor food and drink options were.  Avoid"}
{"text":"They have the best candied bacon, and a nice selection of bourbons to wash it down with"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and love music.  Nachos were gross - too sweet! Sweet nachos?"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. My husband and I were in Vegas for our \"mini-honeymoon\" and were looking for a casual place to eat. We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a go.   First impression was good. The decor was great - had that \"vintage saloon\" type of feel. We were sat inside and were greeted with some water and told that our server would be with us shortly... After waiting 10 plus minutes without any acknowledgement from a server (the restaurant wasn't the slightest bit busy), we decided to move to the bar.  Great decision, the bartender was great! He recommended the ribs which I got and they were absolutely amazing! They were smoky and fell off the bone just how I like them. My husband got the burger and it was very yummy. Our sides were the Mac and cheese and garlic fries which were on point . Our cocktails were bloody Mary's to start and I finished with a really refreshing drink, which I can't remember the name but it had a pretty flower for garnish. Overall, pretty bomb place with excellent food. I recommend sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"First time here, Victoria was our server, OUTSTANDING service. Waitress was super friendly and extremely knowledgable about the menu and knew what to recommend to a first timer like me. Drinks came fast, food came shortly after, super helpful, went as far as offering a discount for mentioning a yelp review. The food was FANTASTIC!!! I had the grilled chicken sandwich my self, and it was delicious. The rest of my party loved their food as well.  Would recommend to anyone visiting Vegas and will for sure be back to this restaurant on my next trip!"}
{"text":"We did not enjoy this place at all.....over priced,not even happy hour specials and the worst service ever. He sat and chatted with customers and ignored us. Just a bad atmosphere. Never again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service we had the chicken verde amazing and the BBQ hamburger with brisket on top it was amazing definitely a good meal For your money"}
{"text":"Five of my friends and I came in here tonight, it was my first time being here. The atmosphere was awesome, food was great. However, the best part about our visit was the server, Victoria G. She was so attentive, happy and respectful. Every person at the table absolutely loved her bubbly personality and she was accommodating to all of our requests!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch. Ordered the brisket with mac and cheese and cornbread. My brisket looked like it was a few days old. Extremely dry, very little flavor and the color, just looked like old meat. Did not resemble brisket. Extremely disappointing especially since upon entering, we were greeted by the most wonderful smoked brisket aroma. My friend ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and was also disappointed. Service, although nice and friendly, pretty slow. Only reason for two stars instead of one, clean cute place and the mac and cheese was pretty good. Don't be fooled by its' looks like we were . . ."}
{"text":"Food was average, nothing compared to bbq in NC. I would still suggest it to a friend."}
{"text":"Caught our nose on the walk by, so decided to give them a shot. The food is definitely not worth the prices.  Appetizer- Had the burnt ends, never had any brisket that tasted this poor- but I'm from Texas. It was pretty much cubed pieces of mostly fat brisket appeared to be pan-charred.  The nachos were huge, sadly didn't live up to the hype. 1st, throwing shredded cheese on top of chips and melting it does not make it nachos. Again, these contained the questionable \"brisket\" mentioned earlier. The rest of the toppings were decent, but these overall missed the mark Entrée-  The fried chicken was mostly fried batter which had very little flavor. You get 3 pieces that were in between the size of a wing and a thigh. The cornbread roll was good, as were the garlic fries.  Waiter- this guy was almost non-existent! It was a weeknight and it wasn't crowded. There were plenty of waiters, so we weren't sure what the issue was. I know nobody's perfect, so we tried not to let this influence our opinion too much.   Overall, wish we had gone somewhere else. Our time here is limited, and it's always disappointing to feel like you wasted what could've been a good time."}
{"text":"The environment is casual, the decor obviously cowboy. The 2nd floor was dead and it took over ten minutes to get a drink, being the only ones at the bar. It was pretty weak sauce.  Besides that, the pulled pork nachos were tasty but a little on the small side considering the $19 price tag. Makers & lemonade ran me $10.50, not too bad for being on the strip. They also have Stella on tap here so I'm G2G."}
{"text":"So my recent travels to Vegas being from July 4th and out there for 5 days, I unfortunately did not get to partake in any authentic BBQ food while on my vacation and needed to fill that void. Double Barrel Roadhouse was fairly good in kind of fulfilling that void for me. Had some very good BBQ chicken, along with some mac n cheese and a beer. Very good eats. Very friendly service. The top of the mac n cheese was a little too crunchy, which in most cases I really do like the crunchiness if baked to perfection, this however was kind of a ehh crunchy but still very cheesy and flavored well so didn't overly mind.   If I need another fix for BBQ food my next go around to Vegas I may definitely come back here again. Nice spot."}
{"text":"Located in front of the Monte Carlo, the Double Barrel offers a great meal!  We stopped in one afternoon to try them out.  Since it was a nice Vegas day, we sat on the patio to enjoy the sun.  It's a nice view of the strip while people watching.  Our service here was great.  Greeted immediately, drinks always filled and fun personality.    We ordered the loaded nachos with wood grilled chicken to share. Trust me when I say there are more than enough for two. The nachos are topped with avocado cream, jalapeños, sour cream and cotija cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  The chicken had a great smokey flavor along with their well seasoned nacho chips. I'd definitely order these again.    We also split the Stacked BBQ Burger.  Meat on top of meat? Sure!  BBQ brisket on top of angus, onions, cheddar and sauce. With the great smoked meat, it gives this burger a little something extra.    It was an excellent meal all around.   Plus with the Yelp check in discount of 20%, I was definitely pleased."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm a fan of trying new restaurants.  Went with a 3 other people who did not rave about their dishes.  I didn't mind the food overall, and I sampled most dishes.  I had the fried chicken, however not a big fan of the breading.  I also had the appetizer like pork rolls forgot what they were called but those were bomb.  My friend had a burger and fries they thought was descent, another had the chicken fried steak which was alright not a big fan of gravy though, and my other friend had grilled chicken which was cool.  I would go back to try more stuff.  The customer service was amazing. I came maybe there 2nd week of opening and I have a SBE rewards card, they were not set up to give the discount yet however the manager Matt I think his name was took care of it and was really cool."}
{"text":"Food was good once it arrived, it was just a little slow getting there.  We went on a Friday night and music started at 8.   Music was GREAT!  Absolutely would go back."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday evening and it was ok. Agree with others that the service was lacking, nice enough but took forever and pretty much were never offered refills on our water (which basically meant we each only ordered one drink, so their loss). My spinach salad was good but obscenely large. They could make it smaller and knock the price down a bit, there is no way anyone finishes it. It was nice sitting on the Strip and people watching but due to the poor service I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The BBQ was amazing. The pulled pork nachos were awesome!  I had a burger with great garlic fries that I would highly recommend if you love garlic!  The service here was really good and the prices were very reasonable considering you are sitting right on the strip!  Try this place out. I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was great but server got order wrong maybe because music is to loud. They play a good mix of music that we like. Over all we would come back here."}
{"text":"So this was our first experience here.  We were looking for something casual and down to earth to take a break from all the celebrity chef and high-priced stuffier places.   We came across the Double Barrel while waiting for the Blue Man Group show.   First the wait.  We waited fifteen minutes for a table for two.  The hostess told us up front about the wait and said we could go sit in the bar area if we didn't want to wait because the full menu was available.   We chose to wait.  There were empty tables in the restaurant while we waited but might have been part of the bar seating.  Either way, we didn't mind waiting and the staff was up front about it.   Once we sat down, the service was very slow.  Our server came up to our table as soon as we sat down and asked if we wanted to place our entire order for drinks and food because it was going to take a while.   We weren't ready to order yet, so we waited until she came back a few minutes and placed our order.   Turns out the server was right.  It took a long time for our food to come out.  Well over thirty minutes.   Once we had finished eating, it took another twenty minutes to get our plates cleared and to get the check.  Overall, very slow for a place of this style.  It looked like they might have been understaffed.  The server was working really hard but she had way too many tables.   Needed at least two more servers.   The food we ordered all tasted good.  However, for what we ordered the price was way too high and the portions to small for two of the three items.   We ordered the baked BBQ oysters, the pulled pork sliders,  and the garlic fries.  The garlic fries were delicious, the portion was good for two people to share,  and the price was right.  The pork sliders were also delicious, but over priced.  $12 for two small sliders is a bit much.   Lastly, the baked BBQ oysters.    To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.  The portion size is four tiny oysters.  To give you a reference to the size, there was a small piece of bacon on top of each oyster.  The total amount of bacon was less than that of one average strip.  There was less oyster meat than bacon.  Bacon is amazing, but when you're ordering oysters, you don't want the bacon to compliment the oysters, not overpower them.  Third component of this dish, the BBQ sauce tasted good, but there was too much.  In one shell, I couldn't find the oyster in the sauce, even after I removed the piece of bacon.  So yeah, for $12 paid for this dish, I was really disappointed.  Save your money on this one and order something else.   Some of the other dishes that I saw people ordering looked substantial and good, but again, overpriced.  $17 for a basic cheeseburger is a bit much.  And while I understand that this is Vegas and things are more expensive, but for a casual place like this, these were a bit too high.   To summarize, the food tasted good but the portions were too small for the price paid on the appetizer and main dish and the service was way too slow because they appeared to be understaffed.   I would probably go back again because I never write a place off after just one visit, but I won't be back soon until they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ wings and they were very good! I ordered the cornbread on the side and it was very moist and delicious. My husband had the double barrel burger and it was ok. The fries were tasty. Nice place to watch the game, there are tvs everywhere you look."}
{"text":"Super leckeres Essen, die besten Spare Ribs, die ich je hatte. Die hausgemachte BBQ Sauce war auch der Hammer! Und ihr müsst unbedingt Mac and cheese probieren! Super geil. Wir waren zum Mittagessen hier, Der Service war auch sehr gut und schnell."}
{"text":"Four of us came here on a Wednesday evening and had a very pleasant experience. Our waitress, Rachel was great. She was attentive, very nice and prompt. The place is huge, there was no wait & you have the option of sitting inside or outside.  We had loaded nachos ($17), fried chicken & mac & cheese ($17) and pulled pork nachos (comes in a set of 4). The food was tastey and the portions were generous so we will be back here again."}
{"text":"First time here, and we were just looking for drinks. We didn't order food and weren't looking for much. We simply wanted a place to put our feet up, enjoy a drink before continuing our evening.   We figured with the name and ambiance it would be a country bar, but sadly we were wrong. Oh well. We were lucky enough to find a couple seats at the bar and ordered a couple drinks, including a Yard Frozen Beverage. Ever skeptical if there's even any alcohol in those frozen pre-made beverages, well this didn't disappoint. We were tempted to order dessert, but decided to pass when we could't get the group to agree on sharing.   Nothing special about this place, the service or the drinks, but it was just right for what we were looking for at that moment. It did take us a while to get a drink even though we were sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"1. Double Barrel Buger cooked perfectly. 2. Fries, perfectly cooked with great seasoning 3. Loaded Nachos with beef brisket AND pulled pork, outstanding! 4. Dogfish 90, perfect. 5. Staff: well staffed, friendly and good.  This place could just coast based on its location on the strip, but the place is excellent!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was impressed!! Hot outside on the Strip but pleasantly cool inside!!  When I checked in on Yelp I received a 20% off our check offer which was really nice!!  *Service: Warm & Welcoming!! The entire staff was really nice!!   *Decor: Was really cool. Steel & Wood everywhere which gives it a real cool look.  The consistency of the style/design is carried well throughout the space.   *Food: The food was really good. Very impressed!!  -The Southwestern Burger was Money!!!!!!! One of the best burgers I've had in awhile!!!   *Recommend: I would!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly my favorite meal of my whole Las Vegas trip. I started with a Mint Julep which really hit the spot. I ordered the BBQ beef brisket platter -- the barbecue was kinda Carolina style, with a bit of mustard. Not too sweet or overpowering. The platter was nice and large with plenty of brisket. The sweet potato fries were the same as you'll get everywhere else. There was live music (a guy playing covers on an acoustic guitar) and hockey on the TVs overhead. Whiskey, barbecue, live music, and hockey: it was heaven."}
{"text":"Zero stars to this place!!!!!!!! If you have a CA ID with restrictions, they will not let you in! Visited on a Friday when they had live Latin music, place was empty so we hesitated to get in but we decided to give it a try. We were a party of 10 and half of them were already inside when this security guard checked one of the ID's and decided not to let my friend in because of the restriction stated on his DL which is just for Federal purposes only.  We travel all over with this type of ID with no problem, this nightclub is not Immigration nor a federal building to implement this kind of bullshit! I will never consider come back to this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great draft beers. A great place to hang and have some fun on the strip. The food is great and the games, music and atmosphere was awesome! We'll be back when we're in town!"}
{"text":"The ahi lettuce wraps were fabulous.  According to my wife the spinach salad was the best she has ever had.  The service was was exceptional."}
{"text":"The worst place in Vegas racist make me feel  like crap the security guard ask us for federal id to go in  after that he say he had strictly order to check id  like immigration officer and they play latino music"}
{"text":"WOW! Amazing ribs, awesome atmosphere and an all together filling meal. Service was great! We are going back to fabulous Las Vegas in July this year and plan to make this our first stop for dinner! Can NOT wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!!! The food is great ! The homemade nachos with brisket are probably the best I've ever had ! We had the double fried chicken and it was so yummy . Loved the atmosphere and our waitress Victoria was awesome !!! Would go back here a 100 times !"}
{"text":"We went early afternoon. The place was not packed and service took a while. Prices are \"jacked up\". Food tasted great, but was not a lot per serving. A pitcher of shock top was $30, and two sliders cost $10 which I thought was over priced. Location was great, right on the strip and great for people watching."}
{"text":"The pulled pork nachos were to die for.  Homemade tortilla chips. BIG plate. Delicious. Beer $8 for draft. ( happy hour $3 3-6pm)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service was just OK.  The food was amazing,  the mac and cheese was delicious.  The house salad is a perfect portion.  The saying goes you pay for what you pay for.  Can't complain on the price.   Normally I leave a good tip 20+ but because of the service being slow I couldn't tip my usual a d that is why I only gave 4 stars...."}
{"text":"The food here was terrible! I ordered the brisket and it was the worst BBQ meal I have ever eaten in my life!!"}
{"text":"On the strip and doing bar food right. Tons of scratch made options to choose from. Fried pickles, nachos, and fried chicken were all winners. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here because of the $50 dining credit that came with my stay at Monte Carlo and was surprisingly impressed! I got the BBQ nachos with pulled pork and beef ($17), which came on a huge plate and loaded with toppings and good cheese...plenty for sharing. Very tasty, although next time I would skip the baked beans (or get it on the side) since they seemed to get the chips soggy. The menu was typical American/BBQ food, but I loved how they offered many sides to choose from, including pig candy, apple cole slaw, and three types of fries...go for the garlic fries! Atmosphere is fun and lively, including an outdoor patio area perfect for people watching on the strip.   Extra star for phenomenal service and offering a 20% military and senior discount."}
{"text":"Ordered pulled pork with Mac n cheese. Pork was full of fat. Mac n cheese tasted like power cheese was used. Cornbread had a fish taste to it. Wait staff very friendly. Smelled good when walking by earlier. Very disappointed. Bar seemed to be busy. TV's for entertainment."}
{"text":"Pretty happy overall  Lots of screens for the games - college and nfl games this weekend  Spacious, roomy  Could see crowd getting packed at night  Great simple food selection of chicken, burgers, BBQ ribs, good tasting gumbo and jambalaya  Service was top notch, and clean bathrooms   Ordered the burger, fried chicken, chicken tacos and gumbo"}
{"text":"Wow how to begin!! This was our first time so we knew it was BBQ.. This place is right at the walkway of the strip!! The staff is very friendly and helpful.. We ordered deep fried pickles $3.00 they were yummy and so getting again.. I got bbq chicken with garlic mash and a homemade roll!! Awesome .. My husband got Bbg brisket with collard greens and home made roll.. It was melt in your mouth good! The prices were $$ but worth it for the taste but it wasnt that big for some people you might leave hungry. But they do have burgers nachos etc so worth trying"}
{"text":"It's a great venue to catch live sports or even live entertainment. Open spacing, with bars that open out to the strip. It's perfect for people watching due to ample patio seating. It's your American fare cuisine with a twist on bar food. All the meat items such as the wings, meatloaf, pork are sautéed in a barbecue sauce base. It definitely adds a hint of sweetness to the taste of foods especially if it's fried. They have happy hour and great cocktails, the spiked tea is a must try because it's presented in mason jar. Also, the lemon merengue dessert is a standout item! Did I mention they serve Badoit, I was pretty impressed :-)."}
{"text":"In Vegas for my first day for business. I don't want to say expectations were mediocre, but I'd lie to say they weren't.  So I was pleaseantly surprised by the food at double barrel.   Don't come here expecting a broad range of healthy items. Do come expecting killer burgers, fries, massive drinks, fried apps, or other fatty material.  If you *must* err on the side of health, I cannot more heartily recommmend the bbq chix  lettuce wraps. They make them for you in individual holders with l individual dressing distributors (I recognize a photo would help but my phone is not synching).   My colleague swore by the burger and fries, which, while expensive, were according to him, out of the park. Music was kind of loud and annnnnnnoying pop country, but otherwise they earn top stars for great food and a nice patio. Definitely a go on the strip for a nice lunch in 50 degree weather (patio heaters were a'firin)"}
{"text":"Came in on a coupon which read buy one cocktail get one free of equal or lesser value! My friend and I were stoked! We sit down in the bar area and the host quickly tells us we can't sit there because we aren't ordering food. Okay fine whatever so we order some nachos. Literally didn't see the server after that for about 25 minutes and it looked like she was he only server for the ENTIRE place. People were getting up and leaving because they never saw a service. We theeeeeen order our second drink and she tells is she can't give is the same drink for free...it can only be a beer or a regular well drink. I'm confused...it says buy one get one free and I correct?? Odd. The only reason for the two stars is because the nachos were amazing! Good job kitchen...shit front of the house"}
{"text":"This dump has ZERO idea on how to check IDs. Oh, so this establishment is a FEDERAL bar or something? Is it a TRUMP owned bar? Is it ALT RIGHT owned?  A California ID with FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS means that a person that has this ID cannot enter any FEDERAL BUILDING or use it as a form of ID to TRAVEL at an AIRPORT. So since the IDIOTS at the door dont know the LAW on this form of GOVERNMENT ISUUED IDENTIFICATION, they use their power trip to deny certain CA ids entry to their establishment. I was upset at the moment, but im glad I was made aware of their bullshit, racist policy. The place was pretty much empty and the dumbfucks were blasting mexican music but they dont want Mexicans in there! Just another P.O.S crap bar that will be closed after awhile. Went all over VEGAS with my ID and its RESTRICTIONS and was welcomed everywhere else. So FUCK DOUBLE BARREL and THE OWNERSHIP THAT ALLOWS THEIR STAFF TO BE STRAIGHT UP RACIST NOBODYS."}
{"text":"I have to be honest..I couldn't remember the name of this restaurant...I had to look it up on my daughters bank transactions ( She paid for it ) I simply never really looked at the name...We had been walking for over 2 hrs..Looking for a good but not so expensive place on the Las Vegas Strip to eat..Which is hard to say the least...Well we stumbled onto  Double Barrel Roadhouse and stood outside reading the menu..When I decided on the 3 piece chicken meal and she decided on the ribs...We were quickly seated and it didn't take long to get our food...I have to say the ribs were simply Delicious and the only thing I will order when I go back ( The chicken was lacking in flavor ) The seasoned fries and Ultra delicious corn bread made up for it! Ohh! The ribs were so tender and soft and tasted Super good! For that alone...I give them 5 stars...Though the waitress needs more training.. ( Hardly checked to see if we needed anything else..Which we did ) To end on a sweet note...I Highly recommend Double Barrel Roadhouse!! Awesome Experience!! Super good food!!*"}
{"text":"Terrible, went on Saturday night late June 2018 warm night, was about 9:30-10pm, walked up asked to be seated for 2. Was seated on the right elevated section had a pretty good view of the dinning area, waited about 20-30mins saw staff after staff after staff walk by and no one seemed interested to greet let alone take our order. Got up and walked out, the table seated next to us arrived 10mins after us and they to were ignored table of 4, short staffed or just bad service. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"This was a fun place to bring the family. Luckily they didn't have any live music because the old folks and kids in our group would have gone nuts. The food and service was really good and the prices were not that bad. If you want some good eats and live music, this is a great place to satisfy our southern cravings. We ordered so much food that we ended up sharing everything on our plates because they really load you up.  I will definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Before heading back home from Vegas, we decided we needed something that wasn't airport food. We came across Double Barrel and decided to try it out.  The inside is cute and definitely sticks to the southern and.... barrel.... theme. Their whole back wall is covered in a barrel print wallpaper (can they not just get real barrels? the world may never know) and they have cute wooden plank walls as well. One thing that I noticed is that during the warmer months, the whole front of the place has the ability to open up out into the strip and there is patio seating.   If you're not a fan of birds, don't come here. There were three little birds that had flown in during our stay and I noticed a couple of older women getting very annoyed trying to swat them away. They really don't do anything but chill on the ground, but I know some people are weird about that shit and may not be okay with birds being in there.  On to the dranks. We all ended up getting Bloody Mary's because we weren't feeling one hundred percent - but I mean it's Vegas, so that's normal, right? The Bloody Mary's were definitely unlike any other I've ever had before. They were spicy as SHIT! And no, that's not the Caucasian in me talking. My fiance and his southern friend were both blown away at how spicy they make their Bloody Mary's too. After you get past the initial shock they're delicious and drinkable. But, be ready for a kick in the pants.  I wasn't too terribly hungry when we came here so I tried to order the Cowboy Chili and they DIDN'T HAVE ANY. I was pretty sad because it sounded bomb. I ended up with going with a side of their mac n' cheese which turned out to be a great second choice. That mac n' cheese was SERIOUS mac n' cheese. Bread crumbs on top, creamy, rich cheese all throughout the dish... The whole nine yards, right there in a small ceramic pan.   Just based off of the mac n' cheese I'd come back. So if you want some fire mac n' cheese and a spicy ass Bloody Mary, these guys have got your back."}
{"text":"What I like about here is the live bands. It was nearly empty late on a Friday evening. We didn't have any food, but they have a decent looking menu. Drinks are pricey (it's the Strip after all). The bartenders were friendly enough and decently attentive. It was a fun, small crowd. There are multiple bars. Lots of seating. And enough room to dance."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after arriving in Vegas. We both ordered burgers and they were perfect. Sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. Atmosphere is stunning!"}
{"text":"Truly a disappointment. Food was mediocre and drinks were very lackluster. Service was decent, but overall I would not recommend coming here if you're looking for a true craft cocktail and good Gastro pub/bbq experience.  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time! Brian and j money were the best. Had amazing customer service and the best bar tender in town!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good time at the bar. Get the brisket with Mac and Cheese side!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try. I had a coupon for buy any cocktail of your choice get 1 free. No exclusions listed. However, I quickly learned from the bitchy bartender that the specialty cocktails were excluded. We ordered bloody marys and they were awful! Tasted like I was drinking bbq sauce with a shot of vodka. Gross. Hated the vibe. Rude service. I wanted to like this place since I stay at the Monte Carlo frequently,  but I predict this place will either close soon or only have the Bud light crowd from the Midwest. I had another coupon and gave it away. A free drink wouldn't keep me at the bar, and I'm a drinker. The bloody mary was so bad, I cannot imagine the food. Dont waste your time or money. Btw, who has a bloody mary specialty and then opens at 11:30? Lame."}
{"text":"I had a dinner meeting with a group of people. I ordered the veggie burger with the fries and I must say that the fries probably had more flavor than the veggie burger. The service was okay not the best I've had but not the worst I've had. I probably would not come here for dinner again."}
{"text":"If I can give this place zero stars I would. I went there yesterday and sat at a table in the bar area for approximately 30 mins.  The place was very very very very slow.  It was approximately 5:00 pm.   NO ONE SERVICED US. NO ONE GREETED US.   WE LEFT. THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome drink specials, the Chicken nachos and pulled pork quesadilla is the best. Definitely a favorite spot. Night time the offer unlimited drinks for 2 hours for $40."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken sliders..delicious!!!!! In the mood for a good snack def. get them. After dinner turns into an all out saloon of high flying action. Girls on the bar dancing, beer pong , great fun for any local or out of towner."}
{"text":"Great fall off the bone ribs. Order the full rack of ribs only if you're really hungry...Huge! Great bar service and music."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, easy and high energetic. Very good for groups the relax after work and hang out!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were pretty good here and a fantastic meal.  Waitress wasn't very attentive and brought out the wrong appetizer that was cold."}
{"text":"Came here with a Bar Crawl. I was very disappointed in the bar crawl itself so therefore I am looking forward to giving Double Barrel another chance and updating my review at a later date. Meanwhile... Upon arrival we were given complementary shots that tasted like cough syrup. I was constantly being moved around wherever I sat or stood being told by staff that the tables or seats were needed for other customers. What kind of garbage is that?! Please note that the bartenders were a pleasure to order from and very pleasant. As far as the hostess who fed me that line, not so much."}
{"text":"I visited Double Barrel Roadhouse while in Vegas a few weeks ago. Double Barrel is in front of the Monte Carlo in the heart of the strip. I had one of their tall drinks with 151 in it. Needless to say, it did the job. Casey was our bartender and was very personable. I'd recommend Double Barrel for a drink heading down the strip."}
{"text":"Came to DB twice on a recent boys trip to Vegas for Fantasy Football draft weekend.  Staying at Monte Carlo, extremely convenient to get to DB. I made this the first stop on my bar hop to the Draft hotel at Mandalay Bay. Sat at the bar, great, fun atmosphere, bar tender was friendly and attentive, and even honored some outdated drink coupons I had!  Second trip was for a late breakfast the next day, checked Yelp, waited for it to open, but Yelp had the wrong hours listed! So I had to wait another 30 mins. Once seated, server was cute and awesome and had great suggestions. Good was ample and authentic. Drinks were good, but the Vegas beer selection is never what it should be IMO. Call me a beer snob I guess.  Overall, would def repeat here, lots of tv's for Sunday football and sports, hot waitresses, good drinks, and an awesome open air view of the Strip. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here at about 2 am with some friends played some great music and had some really great drink prices !!! Played some great Usher, Silk, some other songs I can't think of... Basically some great hip hop songs. But it was a great , quaint place to stop on the strip to drink, dance with some friends and the prices were so reasonable. The reason I am deducting the star is for closing so early."}
{"text":"Must try their salmon burger, perfectly cooked that it'll melt in your mouth!! Great place to have a cold beer and watch a game! TV all around the bar area, and a HUGE projected screen in the main dining area! Bar staffs are awesome too! This is one of my favorite places in Vegas that I'd revisit again and again!"}
{"text":"for vegas, this place is average at best.  the theme and decor is pretty cool but overdone.  we stopped in for some drinks and an appetizer...we ordered a few beers and nachos...the nachos were tasty, but quantity-wise, lacking tremendously...you go anywhere else on the strip and order nachos, you can get them for cheaper and twice or 3 times the size...  probably would not go back"}
{"text":"Walked in with no wait on a Tuesday night and had dinner at the bar.  Good selection of beer on tap, although they were all out of my top two choices.  Even so, still had good beer, good food, and good service.  The service we received from Christian R. at the bar was top-notch.  He took very good care of us.  The place was pretty loud, but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Tried Double Barrel Roadhouse on a Thurs afternoon for happy hour. Found out happy hour only means you can get a Budweiser/Bud light for 4$ or one other shitty beer for 5$ and Buffalo wings for $0.99ea. They claimed to have vodka cocktails for 5$ ea so I took that route but got turned down for a Vodka Collins because apparently Collins mix is too expensive versus cranberry juice.  Ok whatever- little stuff and I expect to get kicked in the nutts when in Vegas because that's how it works so we pressed on and ordered the 13$ potato skin appetizer. The final kick to the taint for us came when the 3 skins showed up the size of red breakfast potatoes. Also all the tables and chairs have a wobble from the uneven floor- not enough reason to not go but enough to say wtf??  Anyway- nothing personal against the wait staff who was only doing their job. Left angry and felt taken advantage of. This is a must skip on the strip."}
{"text":"Had a good time here.  Music was great.  Food was very good. Staff was very attentive and helpful. I would recommend this place.  Prices were competitive with surrounding places here on the strip"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some happy hour and had a great time. Multiple TV's for a variety of things to watch. Extremely clean. Fast and friendly service. Only reason it didn't get a five star was they are closed all day Monday and Tuesday which was unfortunate I couldn't come back the next day"}
{"text":"This place has a great view of the strip, great service, awesome food and an amazing dj. Great place for a chill girls night out! I highly recommend it. Thanks for the great service Sarah!"}
{"text":"The food here was above average, but more importantly our server Thierry was exceptional! I will gladly return here again one my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  My husband and I split the Caesar salad and the DB hamburger with garlic fries....everything was fabulous!!!!    YUMMMMMY!"}
{"text":"They did not want us to sit at the outdoor part of the place because we only wanted drinks. Fairly dumb thing to do, it was the middle of the afternoon, not mealtime. Prices for drinks were the same as everywhere else. No real reason to go there over anywhere else.... It's not like there is no where else to go nearby."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna be nice. I'd read about the comments regarding poor attitudes & customer service. Yep. Got'em both. Showed up at 2:30pm for their daily Happy Hour. Oh, of course. You have to be literally sitting at the bar on one of their 6 total bar stools. And the 10 open bar tables 2 foot away are just too much trouble. All of this was communicated to us with contempt and a smirky attitude by one of the hostesses and bartenders. See ya later..."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow. We were not greeted for 5 minutes and then did not get our drinks for an additional 5 minutes.  The short rib tacos were very good, but the chicken were incredibly spicy."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here so cannot attest to their food quality but this place is fun for a bar stop along the strip.  Been here twice and had fun.  Both times the DJ's were pretty good and kept the party going. They have go go dancers handing out shots for tips and dancing on the bar tops.  Drinks are standard...I think $11 for a vodka soda.  Not weak.  The second time we went there was the absolutely obnoxious girl MC'ing, if that's what you can call it.  Talking about virgins and circle jerking?  Um, I get that this is Vegas but she was just weird....like our WHOLE group, all 7 of us, desperately wanted her to shut up.  My advice Double Barrel? Get rid of the annoying girl that never stops talking, keep your DJ's and go go dancers and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a good meal at double barrel. Waiter was very attentive. Had 2 for 1 drink special, used 20% off yelp check in and only spent $37. Not bad for outdoor dining on strip with view. Had 2 Mai tai's, chips and salsa, sliders, and a Caesar salad. Overall food was very tasty. Would recommend with coupons."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I stumbled into it the last time I was in Vegas and decided I needed to go again on my next visit. The entire staff is really friendly, service is great, and the food is really good. Sliders, nachos, chicken, fries... everything was delicious! 5+ stars definitely!"}
{"text":"Place is pricey, food is horrible. Service was ok, that's about all your get out of your visit."}
{"text":"Great times and food.   Shout out to the best bartender and hostess in Las Vegas!!!   Sliders were good and service was attentive and no issues with any of our orders."}
{"text":"Last night in Vegas and figured we would spend it here. Great drinks and great food. Our bartender \"chris\" was awesome, he has great customer service. He acknowledge me and my wife once we sat down, unlike other restaurants. Chris is cool as hell, come pay him a visit."}
{"text":"The Double Barrel, on the strip in Las Vegas, is an upscale sports bar and caters to the tourists walking the strip.  There is an open area to the bar and the restaurant seating is on a different level.  Every menu item I've tried has been well made and tasted great.  There are many more menu items I still want to try.   The Zesty Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla is excellent!  The Bbq Pulled Pork is ok ... I prefer a more smokey BBQ sauce.  But the Double Barrel Chopped Salad is ... over the top.    If your in Las Vegas and near the Monty Carlo casino, stop in at the Double Barrel."}
{"text":"Third time here. Food and service is good. Love the sliders and coconut shrimp salad. The loaded nachos are my husband's favorite nachos ever. However, we tried to redeem a 20% coupon through this app and were denied. Bummer, but not a huge deal. Would still come back."}
{"text":"Had the skirt steak and Mac n cheese. Both were really good. Started with the chips and salsa, was a verde but still delicious. Had the gentlemen sunrise (just ok) and the blvd bullit (much better). Wife had Buffalo chicken quesadilla and it was good too."}
{"text":"The bartender Chris was hella dope. Would come back for Chris and his kick ass dranks!!"}
{"text":"This is one place I will never go back to in Vegas. They advertise discounts on the Monte Carlo site yet when you get there they tell you they don't give them anymore because \"too many people used them\". Isn't that the point of having discounts? Sounds like a bait and switch scam. The food quality was mediocre at best. It was convenient but turned out to be a bad choice. This is one place in Vegas we will never return to."}
{"text":"Racist place*  Unfortunately Las Vegas does have a racist place and this is it ppl.. am outraged I want to take the time to let ppl know that this place is a inhuman environment. To hate someone for there Image or credentials is one of the most inhuman things a person can do. I encourage ppl to be strong and avoid places like this.. Vegas is a place that welcomes many around the world except for this place. Be safe and always remember we're all here to have fun not be racist..   Viva Las Vegas!!..."}
{"text":"this is a really cool place, walked by and someone gave us a buy one get one free drink ticket. so cant resist that. cool place inside, looks like they have a stage, though it was not open during the weekday day, they do have a full bar, food, cool music playing. we were just going to go in for drinks but then we noticed some of the food they were serving to others and decided to order some. pretty good food, i had a chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries, and a beer. all of it was pretty good. not cheap, but not over the top for vegas strip food location. service was fine, i would eat here again for sure if im near that part of the strip."}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was Luke warm, the garlic fries was all garlic and the cups of ranch look liked they had been sitting out a while as there was a dried film on all three of the cups..."}
{"text":"Came back for a 2nd time because the food was amazing. Sadly our service was terrible the first night and not much better today! Water tasted like dish soap was poured in it so we had to get sodas and they charged us $5 per soda! Food is worth it but be prepared for bad service because the servers are running around taking on too many tables"}
{"text":"Liked music and ambience. However the BBQ brisket at $24 was overpriced, overcooked and unflavorful - do not recommend. Server Bill J was quick but not flexible on drink coupon. Drink coupon was buy 1 drink get 1 drink free but it contained restriction that were not readily clear."}
{"text":"The food was good, and there were plenty of options. But, most importantly, the service was phenomenal. Our waiter was on point, quick, and kind. How much would you pay for that?"}
{"text":"Had a friend come in town for a convention...wanted to stay near Aria..took a chance on this spot.  Has this drink called Raspberry bourbon smash...thee bomb!  Ordered 99 cent Wings for happy hour, and small salad,  was awesome...and did I say we had the best waitress in Vegas.  Rachel, was so sweet, and because of my experience I will be back!!!  She made my experience great!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, would go during every Vegas trip..not anymore! During our last trip in March 2015 I went and say at the bar with two other friends. Bartender was friendly but didn't know the menu, that's always frustrating. Prior to sitting down I ask the hostess if they accepted the MGM resort gift card that I had and she said yes. I then asked the bartender who was serving me and got a yes. So we ordered, most of our favorite items had been taken off the menu, oh well, stuff like that happens. Service was slow, food took forever, wings were way undercooked and gross. Okay, they were having a bad night. Then the bill comes, I put the MGM resort gift card in the presenter. Bartender can't figure out how to use it. Ask another server, she can't. They call the manager who can't figure it out. By now we had waited over 30 minutes and had plans we were running late to. The manager was completely rude and not nice. Didn't offer further assistance or anything. I think just being nice and sympathetic would have been a requirement in her position. Finally I just paid with my credit card and left. I called later to speak to a different manger and I guess that huge place only has one manager on during a busy night. I left my number to have someone else call me. A week later after i returned home the GM called me, apologized and offered me two free drinks. Cool, send them to California dude. I can't believe this place treats customers the way they do. Oh so what, one unhappy guest with all the hundreds you serve. Double Barrel you have lost my business and all who I may have recommended. Get some proper training to your employees."}
{"text":"Although this place is in a prime location on the strip, with outdoor views of the strip, the food was definitely lacking. First,  we came here because we saw pictures of ribs on the side of the tram. Well, when we got there, there were no ribs. I ordered the carne asada nacho bowl, the chicken and waffles, the mac n cheese,  and creamed corn. The nachos had melted cheese, not real cheese, but that fake nacho cheese. The Carne Asada was thinly sliced and all stuck together in clumps and had a lot of tendons.  Obviously not great quality meat. The chicken and waffles were only ok, the chicken was small and dry. The mac n cheese was good, and the creamed corn was not advertised as being spicy,  but it was. We ended up trading it for carrots,  which I actually recommend. I think this place gets away with mediocre food because of its prime location."}
{"text":"This place had great food! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for burgers and bbq. This totally hit the spot after a plane ride from Seattle."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way back down the strip to Bally's because of the 2 for 1 drink special. I did not try any of the food but it looked good. The bartender here was awesome and made my night. He was a blast. The crowd was pretty weak in here even at about 11pm. That's was the only drawback. The waitresses are very attractive as well, BONUS, and that helped a lot being the crowd was very weak."}
{"text":"Bomb, bomb!! My brother was here this weekend from California. I was being a tourist, we stopped at Double Barrel. Very cool Bar/restaurant. I was expecting good food, was very surprised. We Ordered the bbq rib platter to share, it came with a side..we got garlic fries to die for. Shared a steak taco plate, 4 tacos..awesome.."}
{"text":"Horrible service...too bad because their food is pretty good.  Took us over 10 minutes before anyone came to our table....same crappy service as 3 months ago."}
{"text":"Where do I start. We got here at 9:30 on a Monday night. Restaurant was less than half full, got greeted right away by a nice blonde hostess. She rushed us to our table, and as she walked away she said \"enjoy.\" There was no intent of communication with us. We sat down and got greeted by Kevin. I ordered a double bbq burger and asked for the bbq to be on the side and a beer with a side of limes. I never got my limes until I asked for them again (which is no big deal), but the burger came with the bbq sauce on it, not on the side like I had requested. I would've said something but nobody ever came over to check if the food was okay. Overall, I gave it 3 stars because the food was great, but they need to work on customer attentiveness."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas on  Tuesday for 20th wedding anniversary. Place didn't look to busy, saw plenty of open tables. But the 15 minutes turned into 45. Wasn't till I harangued the hostess did a table magically open. Night off to a rocky start.....until girlfriend came back after falling in the washroom because of water. Scrapped up knee and pulled groin latter....   Ordered flank steak, medium rare. Was done perfectly and tasted great. Friend ordered burger med rare, came back rare, sad panda. Wife ordered bbq chicken two incredibly small dark meat pieces \"slathered \" ie drowned in bbq sauce. Other friend ordered chicken sandwich,  was done well according to her.   The prices reflected a place on the strip, but the price to portion was .....very poor."}
{"text":"Great southern food.  We all were very happy with our orders...we had Chicken Fried Steak, Brisket, Pulled Pork Sandwiches, Ribs and Fried Chicken.  The sides were great as well.  They opened recently so there are kinks to work out.  We waited quite a while for our waiter to take our order.  Otherwise we were pleased with our service and it was some of the best food we had on our trip.  I'd definitely recommend it.    Its also great that the restaurant is open to the strip and has a patio area...seems like its more accessible to the strip."}
{"text":"Went on Easter to meet friends from out of town. They were out of ALOT of beer!! Prices were high. $17 for a burger and fries. Service was good."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went Double Barrel Roadhouse last weekend, We had a BLAST with EMILY  (dancer) she was pumping up everyone there and you could feel the energy and everyone having fun.Double Barrel is lucky to have her. One recommendation to Security please keep a better EYE on the dancers, some drunk men just think they can grab and disrespect the dancers. We will keep going to see EMILY and enjoy some drinks."}
{"text":"The food was meh, our waitress was working her butt off and bumped this review up to a 3.  I didn't catch her name, but she was the only waitress we saw the whole time  (along with the hostess, bartender and a busser/runner).  We are pretty sure she had the whole restaurant and she was running the whole time, but never failed to be attentive and friendly with us so kudos to her!  The food was just okay - except for the fries which were awesome.  Nothing special, but nothing bad either.  Husband did fried chicken dinner and I had a pulled pork sandwich.  We both agreed, the only amazing thing on either of our plates were the fries which had a great texture and seasoning.  The bill was surprisingly reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"The main reason for 3 stars is due to the service.  It just wasnt great.  We were in here for a few drinks and a snack (candied bacon btw - 5/5 stars) and we were met with a surprising amount of attitude.  I had checked in on yelp and saw that there was (I believe) a 10% discount coupon for checking in.  I showed the waitress who said great, no problem and then I proceeded to move on with ordering the drinks and bacon.  The drinks took a weird amount of time to come out considering there were only 3 other small groups in the bar (and it's a large bar) so we thought things would come out quickly.  They didn't about 15 minute wait.  Anyway, the drinks were just OK, nothing amazing but like I said above, the candied bacon was amazing.  When it came time for the check I stupidly just laid my card down and didn't check the total and found out afterwards that my 10% discount wasn't applied. Whatever, my fault - but I wish the waitress would have put the discount in at the beginning when she saw we had it.  We may come back for the bacon, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great first impression. There was a gorgeous lady who offered to take our picture before we ate and let us post on Facebook. So fun! We got some blue cocktails. Yummy. And salads are huge! Server was super friendly. Loved the atmosphere and music!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the St. Louis ribs and sweet potato fries it was $21 which was a little pricey for what you get with that being said it is the Las Vegas Strip and there aren't too many inexpensive places left. My wife had the burnt ends and they were really good, but it was a really small plate for $14! That was pretty ridiculous to me. But If you don't mind paying for it, it's a pretty good place to eat."}
{"text":"Great location on the strip, great food, and friendly quick serves! We got seated right away, our waitress got us drinks and when the over menu right away. Drinks were wonderful and the food was really good. I recommend one of the salads or a burger both are good! Service was outstanding she was very nice, knowledgeable on the menu and even great with allergies ?s. Prices where good for portion size and drinks!"}
{"text":"I came back for lunch today and ordered the BBQ Smoked St.Louis Ribs which were amazing and fall off the bone, as well as a side of Mac n Cheese. I enjoyed a Double Barrel Spiked Iced Tea to wash it all down while people watching on famous Las Vegas Blvd. It's been solid both times I've eaten there and will return soon"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch got fast service at the bar by the Amazing bartender  J-Money and Edgar ! when our apps came out Tasha recommended the stacked bbq burger which was AMAZING!!!  Everyone was very nice and informative ! Great place to come and eat or even come drink!"}
{"text":"Great food,  delicious food. Awesome service!  This is the place to be on the strip! Very close to MGM and New York New York."}
{"text":"I am so conflicted because I really want to rate this higher.   The menu is solid - great all American BBQ with fried chicken, wood smoked entree options, wing selections, and great looking burgers and wraps. If this review were just based on food, it would be four stars, losing one only because my wrap was slightly undercooked. If you tell me a wrap is grilled, I expect grilled, not just ... You know, wrapped.   Presentation and decor is excellent. No complaints on cleanliness or overall ambience. Music wasn't loud, TVs weren't blaring.   But major points lost on service. Katie was very friendly, but disregarded our 2 for 1 drink coupons  and up-charged brand vodka in drinks that would not have been otherwise ordered. She admitted to making that mistake after we received the check but made ZERO effort to make any credits towards the check. She became defensive and basically blamed her mistake on us.   Fighting over $10 is ridiculous so we all left."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. Both female bartenders ignored our party while they chatted with one another. We waited for 30 minutes until an Asian gentleman noticed we'd be sitting there so he rushed to help us. He was nice, other than that, this place is no good."}
{"text":"I felt this place was overpriced. My friends and I ordered a snack tower (pork quesadillas, nachos, oysters, chicken wraps, and wings), ribs, and a side of mac and cheese.   My friends thought the ribs were pretty good. I was disappointed they did not have the ahi lettuce wraps available since I don't eat meat (but I eat fish). So, I ended up eating a few chips, two oysters, and a tiny scoop of Mac and cheese.   They oysters had this weird, thick, slime on them, which was unpleasant. I live in San Diego and get oysters often enough to know that oysters should not have that on them. Ew.   The nachos and mac and cheese were pretty standard. Nothing special. The portions were pretty small.   My meat-eating friends probably had a better experience.   The best part was the watermelon tequila drink I ordered, which was great ($14).  Service was a bit slow.   Would be willing to give this place another shot, but with so many places on the strip would probably opt to go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Though our meal didn't work out so well. Manager Josh really came through and made me feel good about returning there soon. Everyone else in our party was pleased with the food and drinks."}
{"text":"A truly middling experience in the crowded Vegas food scene. The problem wasn't really one thing in particular, but a combination of slight misses that added up to an overall meh lunchtime for me and my buddies.   Food was OK, the BBQ oysters for example were good, but the BBQ sauce and bacon completely overpowered the oyster. The fried bucket of chicken was also OK- but the batter was way too thick, like half of each piece was batter. And the veggies tasted good, but were drowning in butter.   Couple that with service that, while extremely friendly, was also very slow (understaffed I'm guessing on a Friday afternoon), and you get my overall experience: meh.   In all, the three of us ordered two appetizers and one entree (7pc fried chicken) and two drinks. All in it ended up being $25 per person. Not worth it in my book."}
{"text":"Stopped for a burger but found they do a lot more than that.  I ender up having the brisket and was not disappointed.   It came with a sweetish bbq sauce which was very good because when they said north Carolina sauce , I was expecting something tart.  They also had a nice selection of music playing which added to the enjoyment of my meal."}
{"text":"Large menu, featuring burgers and BBQ. All burgers come with tasty seasoned fries. A few of my fries were undercooked. Hubby's sliders were a bit overdone, well as opposed to the medium rare that he requested. Then again, it's tough not to overcook sliders. My burger was cooked to order.   Service needs a little work. We waited quite a while at our table before anyone approached us to take drink orders. Also, we booked our table through the app Open Table and the day afterwards we received an email from Open Table about our missed reservation. It looks like the hostess never confirmed our arrival. If you're using an app to book, make sure to confirm that you're checked in so that you earn your points."}
{"text":"Great food, location, and service.  Location - On the strip, just 1/2-1 short block north of the Monte Carlo resort, so very convenient.  Service - Great service. Quick to refill waters and soda, which was very appreciated.  Food - Very tasty. We ordered:  - Chips & Salsa - note that this is green salsa, not the traditional red, and chips are seasoned. Very tasty, though not what we originally anticipated.  - Double Barrel Chopped Salad - a lot larger than I expected, with very generous servings of tortilla strips and avocado in particular. (Probably used 1/2-1 full avocado, which is unusual for restaurants.)  - BBQ Wings - My husband said they were pretty tasty, though he misread and was surprised that there were bones."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner because it was on our way to see a show, and it looked like a fun, laid back place to eat. We were seated immediately, and no more than 5 minutes later a blonde young woman comes to our table and without saying a word pours water into each of our 4 glasses and walks away.  No introduction, didn't ask how we were. After she walked away, we all looked at each other and said  \"I hope she's not our waitress\" Sure enough, she was. She comes back a couple minutes later and asks if we're ready to order.....still no introduction...we had to ask her name.  Jeez, that was like pulling teeth. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because I have a lot of food allergies, and she did help me in deciding what I could eat.  I would not recommend this place, it's worth it to walk a little more to find something else."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get a cold beer and people watch. We had the ribs and and barrels of beer. Ribs fell off the bone."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Monte Carlo so we decided to give this place a try and it was OK; nothing to rave about. We only had drinks and appetizers so I can't comment on the meals. The garlic fries were good but a bit cold and unless you get coupons (they hand them out in the front) for drinks, its not worth the price. Especially knowing you can get free drinks at the hotel even if you just gamble quarters. A plus to this place was the outdoor seating and our server. He was very good even though we only ordered appetizers. We would give it another chance and eat an actual meal so our rating could change."}
{"text":"The best place to hold a company event! Thank you from Do It Right Protocol Training!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Jen was awesome and the tacos and wings....perfection! Has Anthony Bourdain been here yet??? This place rocks!"}
{"text":"good drinks  delicious fried pickles  friendly staff  only went there once during my trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Love the open bar right on the strip. If you order beer get the large. It's more like ordering a pitcher then an actually beer stein. Staff was very friendly. Tvs all round to watch the game. Waitress in shorty shorts. Great prices on drinks, food was reasonable as well. Seems more like a local joint then an over done tourist attraction."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of ordering the bourbon glazed salmon sandwich but thankfully it did not disappoint! The bourbon glaze on the salmon was divine and combined with the bacon & avocado, my taste buds were in heaven!   This place has a DJ and live country music after a certain hour.  The atmosphere is loud and fun! Just keep that in mind...  It's not the place to go if you want to have a deep conversation with someone. You'll be screaming your head off."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food!  Love the outdoor seating arrangement. Service was great until it came to split the check.  You'd have thought she had to enlist the mayor to break things out.  But overall great service. Will definitely go back next time in town."}
{"text":"I went here for a company outing a few weeks ago. The interior is very well made, with TVs laid out in every corner and it was really easy to see the basketball game that was on from any angle. I'd say it's a pretty cool venue to watch a game. I had a Heineken and a Double Barrel Burger that costs roughly $30. It's a venue on the Strip so everything is going to be kind of a rip off. :D  The burger was seriously one of the best I've had. Don't know if it contained kobe meat (probably not) but it was so well made. I would go back just for the burger. Fries are A-OK and nothing special. No garlic fries which is a bummer. I didn't have the tea but my co-worker said it was pretty good. He also said the BBQ sliders were great.  If you're wandering in the area and hungry for a bite, I think this is a good choice. I would come for the burger and to catch a game but it was pretty crowded that day. If you don't mind a crowd, then it's a good choice."}
{"text":"Very loud music which is ok if your into that kind of thing.  Make sure you checkin on yelp they normally give you a free coupon.   Beer selection is dismal mostly big corporate bud, coors ect, but this is the case at just about every place in Vegas.  Vegas asa while has a terrible beer scene."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I am a local in Las Vegas and have guests here. We all specifically wanted to come to the double barrel and I called today to check if it was ladies night as their website says it's unlimited drinks for ladies thursdays thru Sunday's from 11pm-1am. The guy on the phone told me yes and put me on hold to double check with his manager who also said yes. We drove 40 mins to come to this place for 11pm and the whole restaurant was closed? People at this restaurant need to communicate more. Drove, parked, and walked a while for this place."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here and the second time the service sucks.  FIRST TIME SHAME ON THEM THE SECOND TIME SHAME ON ME.  I live in Vegas so I'm always entertaining my clients.  I brought a client here we were a party of two, they were not extremely busy.  It took them 30 minutes to acknowledge us another 30 minutes to get the food.  Now I must say the food was good.  But the service is horrible.  The waitresses have to be told they have a table they are constantly in the back.  My second experience the exact same.  This time I was more aggressive in getting a waiter. He came over took our order brought our drinks and we never saw him again.  I had to ask another waitress for our bill...  Lets say rediculous.  Customer Service is everything...  I even saw customers walk away because of lack of acknowledgement...  I will not setup myself for disaster again no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"They stop serving food before closing time. Don't show up 30 minutes before closing. Pretty lame"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas every year for March Madness, and I thought this place was AWESOME.  I refuse to sit in a smoke filled sports bar packed in there like sardines.  We stumbled on to this place on Saturday to watch the third day of games.  Our wait was less than 5 minutes, which to me is fabulous.  We drank 32oz beers (Shock Top) for $14 and ate multiple appetizers for $6.  I should give this place a bad review to scare everyone away that way I can get the same experience next year when I arrive.  With that being said, this place is 10x greater than the location just to the south.... I won't mention the name  but the name is spanish for the DEVIL."}
{"text":"We finally decided to try this place as we had a buy 1 get 1 free my vegas coupon.  I really wanted to like this place as I am a huge fan of Monte Carlo.  When we walked up to be seated, there was a group of 4 guys who were inebriated beyond belief sitting at the first table as you enter.  One of the guys looked my mother straight in face and yelled \"my pussy\" to her.  I then proceeded to tell the guy to shut the hell up. The hostess seemed very annoyed by this guy and apologized to us. Trust me, I understand its vegas and it happens, but the restaurant should be responsible enough to make sure their patrons feel comfortable.  That should of been our first clue to leave.  We were seated and it took over 10 mins to have our drink orders taken.  I ordered a salad and added shrimp which was good.  My husband ordered a burger and said it was average and my mother ordered the salmon sandwich which made her sick later that day and the next day.  While waiting for our food, there was a huge crowd of people on the patio getting drinks and name tags.  We asked what they were doing and they said a \"bar crawl\" was starting there.  It was annoying to me that this was going on as it seemed all the attention was going to this group and they were not even eating.  People in the group were coming in and taking tables that others were waiting for.  It just seemed like a real cluster.  Now lets go back to our drunk group of guys who were sitting by the hostess stand.  They proceeded to bother more people as walking in and made passes at girls.  Come to find out, they were apart of the bar crawl and should not of even been sitting where they were.  Management should of taken care of moving these guys outside where they would not bother their patrons.  The guy who yelled \"my pussy\" to my mom later proceed to go behind the bar outside and pour himself a shot, all while the bartenders were no where to be found. Again, I understand this is vegas and things like this happen, but you should not be subject to this while paying to have a meal.  I guarantee you if this happened inside Monte Carlo, they would be long gone.  Not sure why Double Barrel supports this type of behavior.  Pretty sad that someone who was not even giving them business chased our business away forever."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  Based on the reviews, we were not sure of what to expect but due to limited time and convenience we opted to give it a try.  The place was packed!  We are bar people so we easily found a couple of seats at the lower bar.  Tip: Go a couple of steps up past the lower bar and you will find a mirrored version of the lower bar on the backside.  The bar tender acknowledged us almost immediately asking if we were there for drinks, food or both.  We placed our drink order, not expecting to get our drinks for awhile because of how busy they were, within a few minutes we had our drinks and we placed our food order.  The drinks were excellent.  The food also came out quicker than expected and was very good bar food.  The bartender regularly checked on us throughout the evening to ensure our glasses stayed full.  At the end of the evening we placed a to-go order of chips and guacamole for a late night snack.  This was taking a little longer than our bartender liked (they make the fresh guacamole per order) so he personally went back to the kitchen to get our order.  The pork sliders and vodka martinis were both very good!  The guacamole was excellent.  There are many, many choices in Vegas for amazing food and drinks.  Although, they may not be on the top of the list for many... I would gladly go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Not impressed . Understaffed !Salad was wilted ice berg lettuce with grilled chicken that tasted a week old. Other family members had pulled park they thought is was ok. They atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was horrible. Of course the gratuity was included since we had a large group ! Gratuity was not deserved! The drinks were ok and ok prices. My pulled pork with Mac and cheese was $20. Would not recommend! There's so many more amazing restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! Salmon over cooked; burger ordered med rare came well done, and little to no BBQ sauce; too much cajon on the shrimp and over cooked!! Mac and cheese not a great; Room cold.  French fries...boring!!! Okay the grey goose martini ok...olives squishy.... but Casey the bartender was very sweet."}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich with seasoned fries. The place is right on the Strip and has a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Yum! I will say for starters that if you love BBQ then this is your place! I don't eat BBQ meals on the regular but when I do I sure can appreciate a place such as Double Barrel Roadhouse! I ended up here because my hotel (Monte Carlo) had some sort of food and beverage credit for me to use during my stay so after searching on Yelp for all the places I could've choose from this one was my choice. I made a reservation on the opentable.com application because I wasn't sure how busy they would be for lunch. Arrived right on time and was seated right away! I love it! I ordered their signature chicken wings as an appetizer and the rack of ribs! No disappointment on either of those and yes the apple cobbler ?! WOW... yeah I will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Had a chance to dine at this amazing restaurant and I'm so glad that I did. They recently upgraded their menu and the food is fantastic. I ordered the French dip sandwich and the meat was overflowing with the caramelized onions and provolone cheese too! The portion sizes are very  generous. The meatball appetizer is the chef's family recipe and they were amazing! I recommend this spot if your looking for a casual yet country vibe. Staff super friendly and attentive. Definitely going to dine again!"}
{"text":"If you want to have fun, this is not the place... si son Mexicanos no están bienvenidos aquí.. Racist place.It's sad that this shit still happens, and that security agrees with you that this place is racist as fuck.."}
{"text":"Everywhere else in Vegas will screw you for your money. Solid beer for cheap. Got the double barrel (72oz) for 20 bucks and refills are only 10. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good place, run by people who care about service and food quality. Great atmosphere. I recommend this restaurant for lunch, and specifically the Grilled Street Corn: skewered corn, butter, chila paprika, aji rocoto, cilantro & cotija; and the pulled pork sliders."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here on a slow night and experienced how different the service is compared to a busy night. The cocktails looked and tasted good, however, I did not like how the bartenders at the bar I was sitting favored some guests more than others. I ordered from what looked like high school jock (blond muscles) and his buddy with odd facial hair. Not only did it take TOO long for them to start my drink because their jokes seemed more important, but I also saw them pour a mason jar full of vodka for their friends across the bar. Being a local, I was shocked to see that happening out in the open at a NEW restaurant on the strip. No managers on a slow night???   The food was good itself, but then again, I was never checked on after. Maybe I will sit at a table where the servers seem friendlier if I ever decide to go back.  For future visitors, food and fruity drinks I would recommend, but for the service, you've been warned."}
{"text":"Got coupon for buy one drink get one for $3. The fine print is that the second drink has to be the less expensive than $13. The first time I had the barrel bloody it was spicy and smokey. Delicious. The second time it wasn't as smokey or good. The Jameson whiskey in a Bloody Mary was actually very good. The garlic fries were so garlicky that you would keep the bugs away if there were any. The shrimp and salmon were ok. Nothing outstanding. The BBQ oysters with bacon were excellent and with barrel bloody were on point. The second time on a different day we came back and had the regular fries that were season with BBQ seasoning rub were excellent. It was $7 for a small order of fries by itself but they were so good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere is wonderful, drinks are strong and very clean. Nicole helped us and we sure nice and accommodating and helpful with menu of drinks and food!! Salads are so tasty and healthy"}
{"text":"This place is located in front of what used to be a Beautiful Entrance to the Monte Carlo Casino, it sits next too that monstrosity known as Diablo's. The place is fine for what it is, it's got live music, and it's loud, but in a fun kind of way. The BT was courteous and took and filled my beer order quickly and with a smile. The bad part is the pricing, in addition to the cost of the beer, there is an entertainment tax, and a vendors fee, so my $9.00 beer became $12.00 after the fees were added in. Still average for Vegas on the Strip I guess, but I hate this nickel and dime BS that everyone is pulling these days. Overall worth a stop in, it was kind of fun, and the ladies working there are quite lovely, and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here. The chicken nachos are the bomb!!! Second to none. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"i got a super delicious steak! my friend got an amazing chili. no complaints.  everything was good!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was really good but I just thought it was so-so.   The host wasn't very friendly upon my arrival. He was semi pleasant.   My drink was the peach cocktail and it was eh. I wouldn't recommend it.   Our table ordered a bunch of appetizers and they were all fine but I've had better."}
{"text":"We were staying at NYNY this trip so every time we walked by DB I got more and more curious! I heard a live band in the back on Friday night and so we decided to go in and check it out. I can't comment on food or drinks, because we only each had one beer.   The place was empptttyyyyyy at midnight on a Friday, but I'm okay with that. It was a High Energy Band, I think they were called Midnight Rodeo. They were calling out Pokemon themed shot specials that kept me entertained. When the band would take breaks a really great DJ came on. The dance floor was big and fun!   The space itself is pretty cool - three different levels, two bars, huge outdoor seating and a lot of TV's. We would def. stop by here again and try the food out & people watch! Thanks for a fun night!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cool place to watch the games on the strip that has great cocktails and really good food, this is it! I love the fact that whether you are seated inside or outside you still have a pretty good  view of all the TV's and you don't feel like you are missing anything.   The service is really good and the servers are pretty attentive. I have been there 3 times and will definitely be back.   I you happen to go you must have the corn dogs, deviled eggs, wings and nachos!"}
{"text":"Good food, but very overpriced. Many better choices along the Strip. Nearly $80 (we shared a bowl of chili, each had an entree, and both got drinks) for lunch is too expensive."}
{"text":"Walking down the strip and found this awesome place!!! Bill was the best!! So much fun!! We will be babk again and again! Order pig candy and nachoes!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.....a little pricey but you are on the strip so what do you expect. We shared the burger with the brisket on it...delish and fries were good too!!! Fried chicken dinner was good....we loved the biscuit but the potato salad was ok (potatoes needed to be cooked longer). Also had the nachos with the pulled pork and baked beans on it.....very interesting but not sure if I would order it again. Cute upscale saloon in a great area....if the weather is cooler you should sit outside."}
{"text":"American music. Go go dancers. Decently priced drinks. I'm in. The ambiance here makes you fit right in. There are all sorts of people here so it doesn't make you feel like you don't belong. On most nights, they have 2 for 1 cards at the entrance!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because they ran out of bloody Mary mix. I was so disappointed because that was the main reason we went but I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Came in off the strip for a bite and drinks mid day. We were not disappointed. I had the boneless buffalo chicken and another had the burnt ends. Delicious. Burnt ends were very tender. Chicken had that buffalo vinegar smell that almost makes you cough, but you know they'll taste great. I had a punch drink that was on the menu, very delicious as well. Bartender and wait staff were very friendly. Perfect place for a relaxed experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during PAC12 week since Shake Shack was completely packed.  This place wasn't crowded at all.    The service for not having much of a crowd I felt was really slow.  Took a while just to get our drinks and at least 20-30mins to get our food.    The interior of this place looks industrial as if you're in a modern warehouse.  You'll notice the catwalk above the place where I heard gogo dancers dance at night.  Very clean and looks new.    I ordered the 3-piece fried chicken, which comes with a side and cornbread for $17.  Bonus that they added a 4th.  I like how the pieces weren't humongous.  Mediocre flavor, and I felt like there was more breading than actual meat, so it was very filling.  Greasiness was very light.    Got garlic fries as a side.  These fries were like steak fries.  I think parmesan garlic fries are best with thing/shoestring fries instead of steak fries, but that's just me.  I'm willing to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch and cocktails! Was not disappointed, the servers and the hosts were very professional!! Great place to kick back and enjoy the strip. Food was awesome, we had street tacos,grilled prawns,the Mac n cheese and garlic fries as sides. Food,drinks, and the service were excellent! Prices were very fair for being on the strip! We'll be back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times to work on my day drinking and had a blast! Jessica the bartender was so friendly and upbeat. I really loved the bar, it has such an open feeling. I had a bunch of friends with me so we all got a few food items to share. A few of our faves were the buffalo chicken quesadillas, BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders, and the Mac and Cheese. We tried the fried pickles but they just tasted like grease to me. There were a few girls passing out 2 for one drink coupons out front too, thats always a good thing! I will be back for sure, but only when Jessica is behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue. Went for dinner. A little expensive, but it's on the Strip so... Great sliders, pulled pork and chicken. Great ribs, sweet sauce but very good. Great chicken tenders. Good service, nice atmosphere, a little crowded. I will go there again."}
{"text":"Pretty patio. Not so pretty when servers unapologetically ram into my chair over and over. Ask me to scoot in if I'm in your way, I'm tiny, I can scoot I swear. I opted to not order a drink because they were out of every IPA on a Saturday morning. Our waitress disappeared for awhile after giving us our food as well.  Now the food was good.  Garlic Fries- YES. get and dip that sucker in some ranch. Burnt Ends-  YES. my friend wanted them more charred but I thought they were great; came with a delicious moist gritty cornbread as well Wing tower- Mm MAYBE. awesome! minus the price. We got the honey bbq and the habanero Nachos- MAYBE. very heavy. I'm used to the LA Mexican food scene and their downright durty canned cheese with diced meat and pico de gallo. It wasn't bad but it wasn't my fave."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this today. She had a burger and I had the chicken breast sandwich. Both were just ok, nothing special. We have had better sandwiches at the celebrity burger places on the strip that were less expensive. With so many places to eat in Las Vegas, this will be the one and only stop here."}
{"text":"Man this place is no good! They try to lure you inside with their buy one drink get the second for 3$ coupon...we sat at the edge closest to the sidewalk which was fun to people watch but holy crap after I waited 2 hours for my burger I was ready to leave. This place was so SLOW! When I asked where my burger was our waiter told us that they have to make sure the meat gets cooked properly since I ordered my burger medium well (nice excuse for the long wait)...well when the burger finally came out it was rare and I had to send it back and wait again. The burger tasted good when it was done right but this place isn't worth the wait and the poor service!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Pricewise, it was median. If you play MYVEGAS, try to get the buy 1 get 1 entree, and it will be cheaper.  I love the Chicken Pot Pie, best one I had so far!!! BF got the chicken fried steak, he liked it. Lemon Meringue pie was good too, but it would've been better"}
{"text":"this place blows dead empty on a wed night takes 15-20 min to be seated  and once seated took 5-10 min for a server once we ordered the server makes fun of what we order  2 ppl who wanted to share an entree before a convert must mean take thier sweet time for our order and once we finish takes 20-25 min for a check!!!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere. Service was bad. Really bad. To the point of being rude  Food is not bad, but definitely not good either. Really poor quality tuna in the tuna lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Bill J was very attentive and nice. Excellent Mac and cheese. I am making this longer so that it is a review and not a tip"}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a 4-5 star, because the BBQ was fantastic (I had the ribs), but the service was meh. We ordered 2 orders of the burnt ends for appetizers, and the entrees came out before the apps. When we asked the food runner about the apps he didn't even know about them. Sooo that wasn't cool but the ribs and brisket and fried chicken were great."}
{"text":"Great ribs & Mac cheese- great spot for a lively atmosphere, people watching & cold beer!"}
{"text":"REAL slow service. It wasn't especially busy or a crazy night but it took forever to get everything. Then I got food poisoning. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I had ribs. The ribs were fair, the service was very poor. It took the bus boy to finally get our check and some to go boxes. Not a big fan but still seems like a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start with what was good.... Ok, now that we covered that, the food and the drinks were abysmal. Really, the worst food I've had in decades."}
{"text":"Stopped in here this past weekend for a few cocktails and some food during lunchtime.  The overall vibe of the place is good and the food was great.  My partner and I split the chopped salad with chicken and angus sliders with a side of Mac and cheese.  The salad was fresh, tasty and the chicken was a good addition to it.  They split it for us which was nice.  The sliders were equally good and the Mac and cheese was a perfect side to go with it......nice and cheesy with a crispy panko crust on top.  Definitely recommend it.  Our friends were very pleased with their quesadillas and fried chicken.  It is also a great place for people watching those strolling the strip during the day."}
{"text":"My recommendations are the burnt ends and the nachos. Holy cow, they're heavy. The nachos use some thick baked tortilla chips, and they're caked into layers and layers of cheese, sour cream, and shredded pork. Delicious- but heavy. The burnt ends melt in your mouth- I'd probably recommend these over everything else. The wing tower was good, but the amount of wings you get for $40 was a little disappointing.  When we sat down at lunchtime, they were out of every IPA. EVERY IPA. How is that possible?! I was craving some hops, but I had to settle for an ale instead."}
{"text":"The food was alright; the service was abysmal. Ask yourself if the trade off is worth it before sitting down at your table."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Omg. Takes me back home.   Excellent location but don't come here to have a conversation. The music is way too loud.   Otherwise food is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food we especially loved their nachos , ribs and steaks if you get a table outside also a great view"}
{"text":"Pretty standard food and drinks.  The seating is not really great and the prices are a little high for what you get.  Typical for the strip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right on the strip, the service was pretty friendly and attentive. The overall food was ok, it wasn't great, it wasn't bad but fairly edible and of course, convenient since it's right on the strip. We had the salmon burger and the street tacos. The salmon was a little on the drier side but fairly tasty. The tacos were pretty flavorful. For a quick bite to eat, I think it meets the goal, for great food, I'd say meh."}
{"text":"After walking by and continuing to look for an outside seating area we ended up at DBR (the aromas also helped lure us in).    Our waitress was young and dumb. She didn't have any suggestions and provided the basic \"Hello. What would you like to eat?\". This was our only turn off, but the food was delicious.   I ordered the 1/2 chicken w coleslaw and my wife ordered the brisket w/ mac and cheese. Everything was delicious! The chicken was cooked perfectly and seasoning along w the BBQ sauce was spot on. The coleslaw complimented the entree very well. My wife's food was also tasty and she left stuffed!   They also had a nice beer selection that I choose from, but once again received no help from our waitress.   *Coupons for a free drink were also available which knocked a couple dollars off the bill."}
{"text":"They have stepped up the game. Peter is a great. Not only did he check on us, he checked on everything multiple times. I will give these guys a try again."}
{"text":"Very good food ribs Cook perfect beer was cold but service need to improve waitress never pick up plates from my Table."}
{"text":"The atmosphere reminds me of many indoor/outdoor pubs with a relaxed atmosphere. Limited food options by the salads that we had were great!"}
{"text":"So this place was right down the strip from my hotel which is the only reason I went. Reviews were ok but yelp community today was not their day. Sat quickly and waited 15 minutes for the waitress to come by. She seemed frazzled but the place was not packed. I felt bad thinking maybe she was new. Still stopping by and getting a drink order shouldn't take this long  Ordered the Buffalo boneless wings as an app. They were awful.  Not sure how this is possible but every little nugget I touched, the coating and sauce fell off. It's like they took chicken nuggets and wrapped them with little Buffalo tear away jerseys. Just terrible.   Next was the brisket dinner. Holy mother of all things smoky. This was the absolute worst brisket I have ever had. It's like they smoked a brisket, sliced it and then laid each slice under a broiler for 20 minutes. Literally the slices were hard, not just the edges but the whole slice. I tried a little bit of each slice but couldn't eat it. Absolutely terrible.   The side was creamed corn. Lordy there is no way they can mess up creamed corn, right?  The recipe is literally take corn and cream it. Guess what..... it was disgusting and I couldn't swallow more than one bite.   This place is at the Aria end of the strip. You will be tempted because you can get there without a 30 minute walk on the strip. Don't do it. You are better off going to the cvs next door and buying year old slim jims, rolling them in the street and then eating them. Same thing!    It's Vegas people. I know it's crazy and expensive but every part of this experience was trash."}
{"text":"Came in here one time and chose the half rack.  Was so good that I ended up having it 3 times in my week in Vegas... But come hungry as the portion sizes are generous (or maybe my stomach is still not acclimatised to the US yet...). Each time I sat at the bar & the staff were excellent.   Bearing in mind that this is the Vegas strip, prices are pretty reasonable & the food quality good.  Ok, time to get an Uber to the airport.  Farewell Vegas you saucy temptress, you know I'll be back.  X"}
{"text":"You comped us 2 dinners out of 6.  You forgot 2 drinks out 6.  Your busboys were very good but your waiter was in the weeds. Wanted it to be better."}
{"text":"Had a couple of brewskis here at this bar, restaurant, and live music venue in the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino.  Pretty rockin' place!  Friendly staff and good vibe!  I will be back, definitely!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was so pleased with not only the food but also with the great atmosphere. Great music and such friendly staff. We had the large draft beers and at 14 each I have to say I felt they were well worth the size. We only ate the app tower and got the hot honey and buffalo wings, chicken nachos (our favorite), pulled pork sliders, and quesadilla. All were fabulous and we were so happy we made reservations for NYE 2015. A definite must for anyone looking for a laid back scrumptious dining experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   Busy Friday night, and waters were regularly filled and our server was alway near by.    The BBQ spring rolls, grilled cheese and fried chicken sliders were amazing.  The fried s'more was simply over the top.  A must order!"}
{"text":"This place is great to beat the heat on your walk from Mandalay Bay to Paris. The bartender pours your drinks perfectly. Not too much, but just right. The owners should probably give good talent a raise."}
{"text":"Didnt have the frozen margarita so got frozen strawberry instead which was pretty decent but didnt come with salt like asked and was served in a cheap plastic cup. Got the buff sliders which were good but server dodnt point out that it only came with 2 and there was 3 of us. Food was pretty quick and all 3 of us enjoyed the quality. I got the brisket which fell apart nicely and the side of mac and cheese is some of the best that ive had and i wouldnt say that lightly the cornbread was subpar. Portions were too small. Got the cookies and the friend twinkies for desert both were just ok. Twinkies shouldve come with caramel sauce not chocolate doesnt compliment it very well. Also got these desserts  because they were also out of the mud pie. Waitress noticed us playing pokemon and gave us 2 free shirts one for each of our teams which was pretty neat."}
{"text":"Good set up, nice selection of drinks, conveniently located. Service is extremely sub par."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. Food was ok. 60 plus for two sandwiches and drinks is a bit much."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and drinks. Service was fine and everything was as expected. Just a bit noisy for me, but then I turn down the TV at every chance.  We'll come back."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here! The food and the service is excellent. Our waiter, Victor was so sweet and friendly! We both had the fried chicken which was delicious but our sides, creamed corn & mash potatoes were to die for!!! Amazing!! Bloody Mary's were exactly how I like em' spicy!!! Love it"}
{"text":"Great vibe inside. Beer pong. Beer bongs. Girls dancing on the bar coyote ugly style.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Nice location. Waiter very attentive. So atmosphere great.  Food - Briscut good, too much sauce everywhere for me.  Mac n cheese - excellent  Dinner salad OK  All in all not a lot of food for dinner. But good flavors and taste. I would return if open later. Sunday closed before my Cirque de Soleil show ended. Too early I think. Strip still packed at 10:30 pm."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food, service and ambience! In our party we had chips and salsa, sliders, pork sliders, mac and cheese, baked beans, ribs, garlic fries, and a taste of their daily soup. All of it was great! Please go and try this place. Worth the cost and trip."}
{"text":"We had the best server 1st off ! INA, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE! Pulled pork sliders and chili were amazing! Cornbread is so goo too. We will be back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had dinner after watching the Blue Man Group. Wife and I both had burgers, fries, and shared a chicken nachos. Food was great, service was friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere was awesome. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I have seen some of the reviews and feel like it depends on which day of the week you come. My husband and I stayed Tuesday through Thursday to avoid crowds and save money, The Strip is very populated every day of the week though so I was hoping for a pleasant experience either way. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess even though they appeared quite busy. She asked if the patio would be okay which I informed her it would and we were seated right up against the railing on the strip for a nice view and some people watching which made for a nice Vegas dinner experience.  We had pulled pork sandwiches topped with coleslaw, with fries and I subed fries for garlic mashed potatoes and my husband and I split the sides. The waitress was very nice and greeted us with a smile, she was attentive and although had many tables, was good about checking on us for refills a couple times as well as to see how our food was after we received it. We got our drinks in about 5 minutes and the food in about 15 to 20.  Pulled pork was pretty good, not incredible, but good, fries were thick, hot and cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes had a nice flavor and were piping hot. They gave us sizeable portions of both.   Drinks, were well made, a little on the weak side, but tasty at least, just wish they weren't $16 a piece, but everything on the strip is outlandish pricewise so it is somewhat expected that you'll pay an insane amount for cocktails.   Overall, we had a lovely dinner experience and were in an out in about 1 hour. I would go back if it is not overly crowded and I think a week night may help with the service times, weekends on the strip tend to be a little crazy."}
{"text":"The food was gross... I ordered the nachos w pork on top and everything was overly sweet and the meat was super fatty. The waitress left us w empty drinks constantly and the place wasn't even busy. I only ate maybe 20% of the nachos bc they made me feel sick.... the cheese did not taste like cheese. I ended up puking them up shortly after we left. I did get to use the yelp discount.... and I haven't tried their mixed drinks so I can't comment on that. My friend said her food was bland."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first meal here.  Good service. Lexie was very nice. Food was good. Pulled pork was meaty and sweet BBQ. Wife's brisket was tender.  Great price for on the strip. Lots of tv. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Traditionally, food was not that important in the bar business....so it was generally unhealthy, uninspired, and inedible (unless drunk).  In the past decade or so, some shrewd restaurateurs figured out that bar-food didn't always have to be crap This created the concept of the Gastro-Pub, which is essentially artisanal beer and liquor combined with high-end cuisine.  Well, the guys at Double Barrel didn't get that memo...because the food here is dreadful.  I had the BBQ ribs and my friend had the chicken-fried steak. Both came out 5 minutes after we ordered them, which means they were prepared well-in-advance and were waiting patiently under heat-lamps to be called upon.  Nice.  On top of that, the place is located right on the strip at the front of the Monte Carlo casino, which requires a 10 minute walk from the parking lot through the casino, to the hostess stand.  If you just want beer and big-screen sports, and you like to describe things as \"awesome\", then this place is for you. But if you're looking for good food worth paying for, then you can skip this place."}
{"text":"The outside seating was 10 minutes wait.  We waited at the bar where we found Johnny the best bartender on the strip.  Johnny made us few specialty drinks. But the best was Johnny's cocktail.  Just that special cocktail alone make us want to return.  We decided to stay and eat at the bar.  All three of us loved everything there.  We see how Johnny interacted with other people at the bar as well.  He was awesome.  The foods were very good. Nacho was very meaty.  Burnt end tastes so good.  Very well worth it.. Double Barrel we shall see you soon."}
{"text":"So I am only referencing the late night entertainment. I'm here from Denver for the iHeart music festival. I won the trip with a friend. So I go to the first night of the show. Multiple headliners and an EDM show that was out of control. But not once did I get out of my seat. 4.5 hours. Not once. After the concert we headed to double barrel for a couple of drinks. What I encountered was NOT what I expected. I'm disabled. The beginning of the year I was paralyzed from the waist down. Totally bed ridden.  During the concert I didn't get up because I couldn't. After the first drink at Double Barrel and the dj and hype man, the combination was undeniable. I couldn't help myself because the guys there make it hard not to. The combination of the music and the interaction, I was on my feet. Holding a table the whole time. But I was on my feet. And dancing. Because I couldn't help myself. I had to be a part of all that was happening at that exact moment. That energy and that crew make that place what it is. Please don't EVER change it. As for me. Find me at Double Barrel tomorrow near the bar holding onto something dancing to everything that comes on."}
{"text":"Great food and in a great location.  The staff seemed a little disorganized but they were busy during that time.  The garlic fries are worth coming in for."}
{"text":"Good food!  Pretty expensive, but about what I expected for the epicenter of the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"This place is the worst ever!!! They are racist to the next level. I would never give this place any money. They check your ID at the door and if you are Mexican with a California ID, they turn you away. Those business owners don't know how to run a business at all. They don't deserve my time or money."}
{"text":"\"That's it?\" Is not what you want to say when small quantity of food with a couple handfuls of lettuce called \"salad\" hits your table? Then stay away. Lunch special sounded like a good idea until nachos were hors d'oeuvre size. Saving grace- it was cheese wiz style. A step up from movie theater. Ahi lettuce wrap was decent. $8 for a beer."}
{"text":"Slow mediocre service and food. Very disappointing. Would have expected to see more attractive staff on a strip front location."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Our server never introduced herself, so i have no idea what her name was. We only saw her to take our order and drop the check. The busser deserved her tip because he was very attentive. There's nothing good to say about the food."}
{"text":"Jonny and Arron made our experience so enjoyable. Our drinks and food were. The wait wasn't bad at all. I will definitely be bringing my family and friends here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"After walking the Strip in the hot sun (that we totally were not used to), it was time to refuel and recharge. We wanted to sit outside to soak up as many rays as possible and the menu was just enough with options of all stages of hungry, so Double Barrel was a viable option.   The Chilled Spinach Salad was just a bowl of spinach with just enough toppings to keep it mildly interesting. Blackberries, which served as the seasonal fruit, and salty Manchego cheese went nicely with the earthy spinach and tangy white balsamic dressing kept it lively.   The sliders of the Mini Mac were really tasty-- something about that potato bun and special sauce. They were hearty enough to really fill you up. And the fries were spicy and seasoned, crisp and crave-worthy.   The pig candy, bacon with sweet and spicy elements, was so layered with different flavors that somehow it totally worked. Super yum.  Our server was super sweet and friendly, despite how super cool she looked. She was also knowledgeable of the menu and open to questions, which is great when you are practically delirious with heat and hunger.   In the end, it yummy snack on the overpriced Strip."}
{"text":"Skip this place! Group of six in our party and a wide open dining area. Sat there and never acknowledged by anyone other than the hostess who first seated us. I mean not even a glance other than the whispers between a server and the hostess while glancing over at us. 25 minutes later still nothing. We finally all got up and left as we asked, is anyone working tonight? We only got a dumb blank stare in response . This place is a joke!!!"}
{"text":"I did not have high hopes for this restaurant, but it turned out to be a stellar meal! When we first walked by Double Barrel earlier in our trip, we noticed it was new and commented it was a great location, in lieu of of the old Monte Carlo fountain/statues. We ended up coming back for lunch because we were craving some meat and the online reviews seemed okay.  Unfortunately we couldn't reserve a table using OpenTable, even though it was available in the search. Maybe that feature is coming, or blocked on weekends...?  There were girls in front of the restaurant passing out drink coupons - buy one, get one for $3. This applied to the 32oz beers (value!) We also had bogo entrees which helped with the bill, but even if we didn't, I would suggest sharing entrees. They are ridiculously big!  +ribs (I ordered them with sauce on the side so I could control how much sauce were on them; dry rub is also really good) +mac n' cheese (SO GOOD! I would come back for just a bowl of this!) -garlic fries (not a fan; kind of soggy) +sweet potato fries (lots of flavor)  +GREAT service!"}
{"text":"The steak we had was mediocore at best the jalapeño bread was hard and medium well steak was rare not impressed."}
{"text":"yikes.  on 11/23/17 at about 8pm or so, my husband and i were wandering around the LV strip having a wonderful evening.  we walked curiously into this place as my husband wanted a beer.  we asked the hostess (a shorter Hispanic woman) if we just seat ourselves outside as we did not see a sign indicating \"seat yourselves\" ... and she said \"are you dining or just drinking?\"  i said \"just a few beers\" and she said \"you have to sit inside if not dining\" (wtf?)... this was off-putting, but, ok um... whatever.  i have never been told that in my life from a restaurant or bar employee...  so we went inside to grab a seat and this time she motioned to us and i walked over to her and she said (with an accent and rather rudely) \"if no dining can't sit here\" or something to that effect.  it was such an outrageously rude experience that we walked right out.  i can only assume that she wanted the place *only* full of people ordering large meals or something and not just drinks but she was SUCH a snot about it we just had to laugh and leave.  are drinks NOT a form of revenue?  because we truly probably would have ordered a lot of drinks there but this woman was such a hassle that they lost a good chunk of change from us.  ugh, i sure hope she is not a manager there.  i will be back to Vegas several times but will not ever give this place a dime of my business.  just keeping it real :)"}
{"text":"The 1 and 2 star reviews below sum it all up. This place has been open for a while and this guy Matthew K responds to the bad reviews saying they will change to improve their business, but actually, they didn't do anything. Back of the house is terrible. Will not go back because i didn't get my food for over 30 minutes. I'm calling Jon Taffer to fix ticket times. Good luck double barrel because your gonna need it"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I walked into this place! The service was horrible! We had 7 and a baby. We went in hoping to grab a quick bite and be out. It was pretty empty when we got there but they seated us at a tall table that wouldn't fit the high chair for the baby because they had a party of 25 coming in in 20 minutes. We were there over an hour and that group never showed. They brought water and two glasses were dirty. The food was super slow coming out. The potato salad wasn't done. The potatoes were still raw. Someone ordered salmon and it wasn't cooked. It was raw throughout. We asked them for cooked salmon and they actually threw the one we'd just tore apart back on the grill. Cross contamination much?? They should be shut down!! Who puts food that a customer has touched back on the grill to cook?? What if he had had a major cold or flu and had just infected the rest of the people who are trying to eat there?? They didn't keep our waters full. It was a fifteen minute wait to get anything...from ketchup for the fries to clean silverware. When we asked for our bill, it took them over thirty minutes to get it. It was hot and nobody wanted to be there sitting there waiting all night. It was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas local and in the service industry myself, I was really excited to check out this new hot spot. And I wasn't disappointed! First off, they were very busy, but mainly from possibly being under-staffed. But that didn't stop our waitress Nicole from giving exceptional service. She must of had half the tables in there, but she still managed to make recommendations and treat us like we were her only table. The buffalo sliders were the best I've had and every specialty cocktail we tried was amazing. They really took the time to create a unique cocktail list (although, the beer selection could use some work) Overall, besides the small kinks that they need to figure out, this place was awesome and the friendly staff made it that much better!"}
{"text":"When we pulled into Vegas, and looking for a place to eat, we decided on Double Barrel Roadhouse simply because it was attached to the hotel/casino we were staying in (Monte Carlo). When we got there is was a little breezy and blustery outside, yet that is where they wanted to seat us. They got really annoyed when we asked to sit inside.  Once we were seated, we waited for 15 minutes...and no waitress waited on us, we had to ask who our waitress was...again, they seemed annoyed. After finally ordering and getting our food, the other guests with me seems to like the food they ordered, that is why this is getting a 2 star review.  I was not overly happy with my fried chicken. First of all the batter was fried beyond belief, and very tough. Also, I could not even tell what part of the chicken I was even eating...very odd sized portions of chicken.  I am not sure sure if I am getting grumpier as I get older, or just less forgiving...but when I have to pay for food at a restaurant, I expect it to be good...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...when I have to pay your staff and tip them, I expect EXCELLENT SERVICE AND ATTENTION... both of which we did not get here.  With so many other choices of places to dine in Vegas, this will not come up on our list again."}
{"text":"Incredible! The food. The service. The location. Best spot to stop on the south strip for a drink and some lunch right on the strip. TRY THE WINGS! Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch, and it was great. Portions are really large - it's delicious food, but be prepared, it's heavy!   My boyfriend and I ordered an assortment of appetizers, and we couldn't finish them; the nachos were huge and delicious, and I definitely recommend them with the pulled pork. We also ordered chicken wings and fried pickles. The wait staff was very attentive, the atmosphere was fun, and there are plenty of TVs around to watch the game. They have a good variety of beer, both bottled and on tap. I would definitely return. Plus - each day we were in Vegas the restaurant had staff outside handing out buy-one get-one for $3 drink tickets! If we were in Vegas longer we probably would have returned."}
{"text":"Food was good. The food came out quick but the waitress disappeared for a while. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Sat for 25 minutes seated by an open sliding glass door in 40 degree weather while the wait staff stood around chatting with each other. No one even bothered to bring water. We just got up and left, and no one bothered to ask why. Uuhhhh.... this is one to skip."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places on the strip. Me and two friends stopped in to have a drink and ended up staying for lunch. Our server, Crystal, was so friendly and attentive and is the reason we stayed and ate. She talked us into trying the \"pig candy\" (sweet, caramelized bacon strips) and we ended up each ordering lunch and spent the afternoon drinking and people watching (they are right on the strip). Now we are fat and happy and ready for a nap before we go out tonight! LOL! We'll be back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks.   Awesome music and environment.   Ribs are tough which is unfortunate.   But satisfied with experience."}
{"text":"Just had my reservations cancelled that I've had for about a week because someone apparently bought out the restaurant just today.  Totally BS, that kind of thing should be booked in advanced and if you have people who took the time and thought ahead and booked reservations you should honor them.  But I guess it's only about the $ here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Adam was our bartender, but I would hardly call him that. My boyfriend orders a vodka redbull (they only sugar free). The cup is literally half full..never even asks me if I'd like a drink. Charges $17.50 for the cocktail. In Vegas, we know drinks will be expensive, but it didn't feel right paying that much for a half a drink. I asked him about the drink and if their cocktails are always half full. He shrugs and says something about it being in a pint glass, and how normally it would fill a 12 oz..it's funny because that's only a 4 oz difference, but cup was HALF full. Ironic enough, I am also a bartender, and when I make cocktails for my guests I make sure appearance is great. If the cocktail looks a little low, add ice or more mixer. This guy could give a shit less. The other bartender on duty was also mumbling and grumbling under his breath - pissed off about something. Not at all a good experience, and I ended up getting my drink somewhere were I was actually asked if I wanted a beverage. What a joke lol will not return!"}
{"text":"Happened to stop in and what a great show by Sam Riddle! The place is amazing.  Hang out with your friends and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Mwâh......great location, ok service and mediocre food.   Set on the terrace overlooking The Strip. Always a bonus. Ordered a house Chardonnay (11 for a very, very small glass) and the nachos. Came out quickly. And were ok. Some nachos were hot and even a little bit burned, while not half the cheese was melted. The added chicken was hard to find. Lots of peppers, tomatoes and some kind of mayonnaise/ sauce. Nothing like guacamole.   After the nachos my husband had a perfectly cooked Double Barrel Burger. Nice fries. Nothing to complain about. I had the Cobb salad. Unappealing to see served in a glass bowl. Way, way too cold so it didn't had any taste. And nothing that resembles a blue cheese dressing.   Will come back because of the view. Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"While in town at our #PetSittingOlogy conference, our group stopped in for lunch. Can't say I was impressed. Very little for vegetarians to eat, extremely long wait for water and drink refills, had to ask 3 times for silverware and a napkin. Cancelled my root beer float order because it was taking too long to get. Our server was busy, granted, but I'd expect her to be handle taking care of us. Loved the atmosphere but MIT a place to go if you're with 9 other people."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  I ate a lot of BBQ when I lived in Texas and wasn't impressed with this place.  The menu was not GF friendly but I made the best of the situation.  My frozen marg was the best part of the meal.  I'd probably pass next time I'm on the strip."}
{"text":"The best things about this spot, are the atmosphere, the view, and the layout. A great place to eat with a big group, or watch a big game. The drinks and food are pretty good, but what truly makes this place is the service. One of the managers, Matt Kelly, made sure our every need was taken care of. Don't miss this spot next time you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh, where to start... So, my friends were coming into town for a birthday. We made reservations at Double Barrel Roadhouse on OpenTable for the special occasion. They were able to accommodate our party of eight, which was good. There was also a gentleman outside, who was passing out a 2-for-1 drink deal coupon for the restaurant. So, we picked up a few of those to use for the night.  We ordered our drinks. Everything seemed to have been going fine until the meals came out.   Three of us ordered steaks. $40 a pop. We ordered them in three different temperatures: rare, medium rare, and medium. However, they didn't come out at all like they were supposed to. My rare steak was more like medium rare, and the other two were fully well-done. The steak was okay, but not worth the price, even by Strip standards. The birthday boy and my other friend sent their steaks back. It eventually came out tolerable.   My boyfriend ordered the burger. It was supposed to be served with a fried egg and bacon on it. However, when it came out from the kitchen, there was no egg to be found, and the bacon was burnt to a crisp, literally. Like, it was blackened. I like my bacon crispy, but the strips were almost unrecognizable. He told the food runner, who then brought him out a plate with a fried egg on it. Eventually, the manager took the entire burger back to be remade.   My friend's dad also had extremely burnt bacon. But, being the sweet old man that he is, he didn't complain about it.   My other friend ordered the chicken and waffles, which he said were very good. It was the only meal that was positively reviewed by our table. One out of eight. A restaurant has got to do better than that, especially one in a 4-star hotel.  The manager was nice in the ordeal. He comped a round of our drinks, however, I believe they were supposed to be comped anyway because of the coupons. My comped drink also came out 3/4 full. Like, what? It is too much to fill 'er up? I feel like they could have done a little more since more than half of our meals were entirely unsatisfactory. He also didn't come back to check on us after the first time.  They also forgot to bring refills, appropriate silverware, plating, and so on. Normally, I wouldn't really care about all that, but on top of everything else... it was extremely disappointing.   So, our server was polite and managed to remedy the situations that arose. However, we were not happy with the way he handled our check situation. On one of the tabs, my friends' bill amounted to $85 (or something like that). So, they put a $100 bill and a $20 bill into the check book and specifically requested change. The server kept the $20 bill and brought back only enough change for the $100. So, he took the liberty of tipping himself $20. That really isn't part of \"Can we please get change?\". We were pissed. We didn't want to deal with the establishment further, so we left without making a fuss about it.   Overall, I will never be back. Too many things went unnecessarily wrong. It was such a disappointing birthday dinner. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Take your business elsewhere. There are much better value places that maintain a higher standard of food and business."}
{"text":"This restaurant is at a great location in the city, very close to the Monte Carlo hotel. They don't have too much variety, and this place isn't very vegetarian-friendly. We ordered nachos with part of it without meat, but it didn't come for a while, and it still had meat in it. They did replace it shortly after, though. The food was OK; it's good for what it's worth. The staff was really nice and refilled our drinks relatively quickly."}
{"text":"This bar has beer pong from 10:00pm to close! We were going to come back for it but realized that the specials and deals in this bar weren't worth it. They had the same deal as the restaurant across the street called Diablos Cantina, \"two-for-one.\" In the end it still only saves you one dollar for two beers since you are unable to use the coupon on happy hour or any special yummy drinks. Has to be rail or beer =( I don't understand why they do this since all of us can get free beer and drinks in the casino, you would think that they would have better deals on the strip to maintain people buying directly from them nonstop.   I viewed their menu and was sort of glad that I ate across the street at Diablos. I just wasn't very keen on their food choices. The bartenders were very young--or at least they looked like it. Both were kind and humble except when the one male bartender started to complain to another server about how stupid the two-for-one deal was in front of us. I thought that was unnecessary.   Also a quick fun fact: I have never seen bathrooms share a sink. So in between the men's room and women's bathroom doors was a space reserved for washing hands. This tends to be great and awful at the same time. At first I was like \"Sweet no line at the sink!\" then at second thought \"oh god...everyone can see me pick at my face and do my hair.\""}
{"text":"Awesome service. Very attentive. Sat us right away and made sure to get our drink orders in right away. Cool location and good music playing. Great place to people watch!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here because a B.O.G.O. Entree offer he received online and decieded to eat here during our stay in Vegas Labor Day Weekend. Have to say it was definitely one of the best decisions of the weekend. Walking into the restaurant I managed snag ANOTHER offer for drinks which made for an extra awesome meal!   Interior was pretty nice and modern but I'm sure that's the case with majority of Vegas restaurants you dine in Vegas. Very open and a large bar in the middle of the restaurant.   Started off with drinks, bogo was for good for well drinks so I went with my Henny and Coke and my buddy went with his Gin and Tonic. $14 a piece they were pretty damn good size so that was definitely worth it even without the bogo. Was big enough to actually fill a child's to go cup (which we found out later because my buddy couldn't finish his drink)   Food: My friend went with the New York Steak with \"fries\" and I went with the Full Rack of Ribs with Mac and cheese. Steak was the priciest of the two with both meals being just under $30.  The Steak was pretty damn good. Quality steak with a quality cook. He ordered medium well which I am personally not a fan of... BUT even with that one piece I took, i had to say it was quite enjoyable. Now the \"fries\"... I thought these were just going to be your run if the mill steak fries you get at the majority of Chili's/Applebee's... Oh but I was wayyyy mistaken! Truffles fries! Can say I've had Truffle fries that good before this.   My ribs. Can't remember the last time I ordered a full rack of ribs, but damn these were huge. Too big for the plate so they had to stack them up on each other. Sauce was on point and the meat were just falling off the bone... What more can you ask from such delicious dead animal?! Even the mac and cheese impressed me. Taste of real cheese, macaroni that were nowhere near overcooked, and that layer of crunch from the breadcrumb topping. I definitely enjoyed myself.   With the offer for drinks and entrees, meal came out to $45! But have to say would definitely pay full price if I was in the mood for some Steak and Ribs. Service was also friendly! Our sever joined me as a poked fun at my buddy for asking for a Togo cup for his drink he failed to finish."}
{"text":"Sitting just outside the Monte Carlo, Double Barrel has a unique charm with an enormous bar replete with plenty of taps and flat screen TV's. Beyond that, there's absolutely nothing special.   My wife and I went with another couple last night before attending event at the nearby T-Mobile Arena. We had made a reservation earlier in the week, which was good since there were plenty of people on the strip - both Cher & Katy Perry in town at venues right next to each other. We were seated promptly, though it took entirely too long, about ten minutes, for a server to visit our table.   We had ample time to look through their extensive but bland menus. I'm not sure what I expected, but the food options at this \"roadhouse\" were equally diverse as they were confusing. Chicken wings, street tacos, burgers, French dip and Cuban sandwiches, and a pasta primavera. I had imagined this place would be more of a BBQ or steak joint, but I was sorely disappointed, as was my wife who made the reservation.   We ended up ordering our food and drinks at the same time when our server finally arrived. I settled on the DB Pub burger and my wife the southwestern Caesar salad. She also got the summer sangria, which ended up sounding way better than it would taste. Our food took far too long than it should, though on a busy Saturday night I wasn't too upset. I was more taken aback when our server delivered our drinks, and challenged me when our server delivered a margarita instead of the sangria and told me, \"that's what you ordered.\" My wife's salad was quite peculiar. A Caesar by traditional standards, but with cilantro bits in the dressing, and black beans and corn - I guess that's what \"Southwest\" means? My burger was severely undercooked and the fries cold.   Our server returned to our table about ten minutes (timed) later to check on how our food tasted, and was apologetic when we told her what was wrong.  She apologized and explained the bartender made a mistake, and was quick to make sure the chefs remade my burger and fries. The sangria was brought rapidly, and my burger was remade promptly as well to my pleasure. However, everything was just blah.   Overall, we left realizing it would likely be our first and last visit to this strip establishment. As locals, we don't make an venture down to Las Vegas Boulevard that often, but this place is definitely one we won't be making an effort to come to again. Food was mediocre at best, and the service was less than stellar. If you're walking the strip hungry and need a meal, this place suffices, but don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"I visited Double Barrel Roadhouse after the Golden Knights game on March 31st.  We were drawn in by the music as we walked by and a nice employee provided us with a but 1 get 1 drink ticket. I'm glad we came in because their was a live Hispanic band and we danced the evening away.   It was fun and it allowed us to practice our wedding dance. They sang popular songs and the crowd was hype.   Food: We didn't eat any food. My review is based off of my experience with band and bartenders."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. It was 20 minutes before our drinks order was taken. Drinks were very slow to arrive too. Meals arrived and my sliders were cold. No water was available on the table. Overall, quite disappointing.   Upside - location was good."}
{"text":"Popped in for a beer while walking down the strip - great atmosphere, and good tap list but the excellent service provided with advice on good local beer places is what will stick out to me."}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way out of town. We ordered chips and salsa for an app, and was great for 3 dollars. We then ordered the pull pork sliders and street tacos, typical Vegas price about 17 each, Our only complaint was the waiter not being friendly or welcoming. A table behind us asked to have their burger to be cut in half and the waiter simply said \"oh you can\" deft not great service. The waiter Bill was even too busy to fill our water, because he was giving the other waitresses neck massages, or wondering off to the back with them. Since the food and price was average I would more than likely not return again due to the horrible service."}
{"text":"Good food; customer service sucks!! Server was not attentive. A good variety on the menu, something for everyone. Full bar and creative drink selections....good choice if you want to chill and eat on the strip. Severs and hosts need training to enhance people skills......smiles go a long way"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere ! Excellent food ! Great drinks . Very reasonable by Vegas standards. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm not one to post a lot of reviews but the food here was so terrible I feel the need to warn others not to waste their money. We got the pork and beef nachos, chicken sliders and the buffalo chicken quesadilla. Each one was worse than the next."}
{"text":"Are you hungover? Looking for something to fill your booze-soaked gut? Need a hearty meal to get you back at 100%?  Then look elsewhere.  After an entire day of liver-wrecking, my buddy & I woke late in the day and thought we needed something more substantial than the usual eggs-and-toast breakfast. Since this place is all shiny and new it acted like a beacon, calling out to us to stop in for a bite. The open air seating was attractive since neither of us felt like being too confined. We needed a constant flow of fresh oxygen, even if it was from Vegas' smoky streets.   I ordered up a Bloody Mary to get things going. The waitress warned me it was spicy, which I didn't consider a problem. What WAS a problem was that it just plain sucked. There wasn't much spice to it, just the overwhelming flavor of BBQ sauce, which someone at some point in time thought was an acceptable ingredient in this drink. I'm not one to leave a wounded soldier to die on my table, but I just could not get this drink down my gullet. And I really tried.   Both my friend & I ordered the brisket plate. They don't have any lunch specials here, so you're basically forced to order up an entire 1/2 lb. of brisket at once. I opted for the sweet potato fries as a side since everything else looked extremely heavy.   When they served it up, we immediately felt a wave of regret wash over us. My friend took one look, had a tiny bite of meat, and then decided he was probably going to puke if he kept at it. I covered his plate with a white sheet (napkin) and laid it to rest.   As for my meal, I didn't fare much better. The brisket itself was plentiful... and plenty lukewarm. There were, what, 5 or 6 other tables occupied here. How exactly did my food come out barely hot? The plate also included things like a parsley bunch and a grilled lemon. Function over form, chefs! WTF am I going to do with a grilled lemon? It's a plate of brisket. I asked the waitress and she said it was for presentation. A better idea? Don't waste lemons on a \"presentation\" that serves no purpose.   Even better idea? Don't waste time - and a considerable amount of money - eating here."}
{"text":"To start, I don't know how the service somewhere can get much worse unless they spit in your food, tell you about it, and tell you to eff off. We ordered 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in an attempt to have a \"quick meal\" before hitting the pool. We chose this spot on the advice of the MGM concierge, our main criteria being somewhere in walking distance that is \"outside with strip view.\" That pretty much explains the best attribute of the Double Barrel Roadhouse in 4 words.   After 30 minutes, we inquired into the existence of our grilled cheeses. I am positive this is when our order first made it to the kitchen. Another 15 minutes later, we had to walk inside to complain about waiting 45 minutes for a grilled cheese. 20 minutes later, still no grilled cheese. You would think they would make it a priority after MULTIPLE complaints. The place was more than half empty. After speaking with the manager, I explained as politely as possible that it's just 4 pieces of bread and cheese with some avocado and bacon inside and not duck a l'Orange. Following such a complaint, it should have been made within 10 minutes. Over an hour after our arrival, and after watching the table next to us sit, order, eat, pay, and leave, we had our sandwiches. I am adding the 2nd star because they actually tasted really good, despite being VERY heavy, and because the manager comped our meal, which included 2 beers. Of course they also got our bill completely wrong, which added to their reasons for comping our meal. The manager claimed he \"doesn't know what went wrong\" with the hour plus wait for our simple meal. Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food. When this place closes down soon, I will definitely \"know what went wrong\" with it."}
{"text":"Small portions, server was nice but overworked. We ordered ... He forgot our order ... Came back got it again. Wings (that we waited for for 35 minutes) were dry. And there were 6 of them for $14.  We told him we were done and wanted the check and waited another 10 minutes for a manager to give us the 20% discount from yelp. Poor kid. What kind of management leaves on a Saturday at 4:30??? 2 stars because of that. Shame!    No happy hour? Diablos up the way has 2 for 1 drinks ... C'mon.   Boooo. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night around 6:30pm. It was not that busy. Our server took 10 minutes to take our drink orders. It took another 5-6 minutes to get our drinks. Our food came out very slowly. The chicken tacos are very spicy. It really should be indicated on the menu or told how spicy they are. I enjoy spicy food and couldn't handle. The tacos are packed with meat but you don't get a side."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place in the multitude of things they had to offer like shrimp and drip grits, smoked chicken wings, Okra, college greens, margaritas were amazing, deviled eggs and salmon , perfect; fried chicken collard greens and and portobello sliders. That drink called the blue orchid was really pretty weird but really pretty. They also have three bars with a floor show that happens overhead in this very industrial looking building. The show is complete  with  really cute dancers who dance above you and there's also an awful lot of Las Vega$$ \"people watching\" as you watch the crazy tourists walk the Strip just outside of the Roadhouse.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Located in front of The Monte Carlo Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. For a \"roadhouse\", whatever the devil that is, they have an ok selection of beer, but still acceptable. You can easily get a BOGO coupon right outside. It is worth a stop in on your walking tour of the strip for a quick break. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"This new open air bar is awesome!  It was the perfect place to gather with friends  and watch the basketball games during March Madness over the past weekend.  The service was friendly and quick, and their Bloody Mary is THE BEST in Vegas!  They have a smokey taste that is really unique and just delicious!  There are tons of appetizers to share with a big group - be sure to try the sweet potato fries and the appetizer tower.  Getting a few plates to share is the best way to go.  The bar faces the strip so you can see what's going on, and it's so nice to have a fun place to hang out that is not inside a casino.  Definitely venture out of the norm and try this place out!  Cheers!  :)"}
{"text":"Cool Joint.   Not too loose and not too upscale.  Comfortable and cool.  Great staff.  I met the Chefs and they are great folks, and the food is simple and good.  Not so simple its boring, but no nonsense.  Quality ingredients and quality employees bring together a very good dining experience...  Go fancy or casual and they accommodate all levels to and from.  Chef Sandra went out of her way as well to make sure my vegetarian mom and picky kids were as happy as my meat eating self :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on the drinks alone, I did not eat here*  Drinks are very weak. They are not measured correctly at all. I saw the guy pouring our shots & it didn't even reach the top of the ounce pour. Someone was standing outside, handing out coupons for buy one, get one for $3 drinks. Seems like the best deal ever, right? Wrong. Maybe if you're just drinking beers so it doesn't take any actual pouring it MIGHT be worth it. I just didn't want to fill up on beers as it's Vegas & you have to pace yourself both drink & food wise. I sat with an emptry drink cup for about 15 minutes before the bartender finally ended his conversation with someone down the bar & came to take my second drink order. I definitely won't be back, nor will I be suggesting this place to anyone I know. I really wanted to love this place, but it just did not deliver."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Took us 15 minutes to get water and it wasn't even busy! Food was lukewarm and unimpressive. There was only one drink on their list that interested me and of course they didn't have the ingredients to make it!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, just another overpriced LV Strip eatery.  It was much better than that. The Southwestern Burger was very tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. My date had the veggie wrap and it wasn't up to her expectations."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday evening, not crowded at all, which is somewhat surprising in Vegas.  The food was disappointing.  The chicken wings tasted okay, but were rather small in size.  We ordered a Hangover burger and a Pub burger.  We are pretty sure the hamburger patties were previously frozen as they were small, flat and lacked any amount of flavor or juiciness.  I subbed a side Caesar salad for my fries.  Yikes!  Not good at all.  It was served in a small metal bowl.  The lettuce was in huge pieces and it was so over-dressed that the croutons were soggy.  Also, the dressing tasted just like Thousand Island dressing, not Caesar.  I brought this to the attention of our server, who agreed it was over-dressed, but that the dressing was their Caesar.  She offered to bring out a new one, but at that point we just wanted to get out of there."}
{"text":"Restaurant was empty. We were put at worst table with high top stools. Totally uncomfortable. Service took forever. Cob salad was awful. The tomatoes were mushie. The drink orders weren't correct"}
{"text":"This place is in a prime location on the strip, right under/outside of Monte Carlo and right next to the new Park area inbetween Monte Carlo and NYNY. With this, I definitely expect some steep prices and boy was I not wrong.   They have a happy hour that lasts from 5(?) to 7pm with $4-$6 items. I remember off the top of my head that some beer on tap was $5 and well drinks with vodka (Skyy or pinnacle) were $6. The bartender made really delicious vodka pineapple!   Ask for Johnny! He was an amazing bartender and really customized our drinks to our liking.   As for food... I definitely think that the pulled beef and pork brisket nachos is a mandatory dish to try. You will thank me.   Minus one star for steep prices :("}
{"text":"I got a good deal with MyVegas - 2 entrees for one price. I went there for dinner on a Saturday night at 6pm. The wait time was 10 minutes. I sat in the patio area with nice ambiance and next to sidewalk. The waiter was nice and good on refills. I ordered 2 $24 steaks with French fries and the steak was tender. I wish there are better side items. The apple crisp with ice cream was delicious. I would come back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Located at the Monte Carlo, great location overlooking the Strip. Like most Vegas bars, not cheap, but they do have a good happy hour, and a great selection of whiskey. We didn't eat, but I am told the food is good. Great place to have a drink and people watch on the Strip."}
{"text":"It looked like a cool spot for drinks n appetizers.  I'm all about customer service and this place was horrible. They seemed so unorganized and our original waiter never came back to take our order.  The current server was nice so I appreciated that."}
{"text":"Went here last night the only thing worse than the Burnt Ends was our Waitress Brought me water with no Ice then got an attitude when I asked for some ice...don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Some very yummy steak, brisket, sweet potato fries and biscuits! Good service. Good place to watch the football game."}
{"text":"Tons of hip Country music and some truly delicious ribs.  I would seriously rate the ribs about #3 for the best ribs I've had in my lifetime and that's saying something, because I eat tons of bbq.  The tangy sauce was delicious and balanced well with the cornbread which was just slightly sweet.  The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly, attentive and upbeat.  She answered my questions about the menu and was knowledgeable.  It drives me nuts when I go somewhere and ask suggestions and they either have never eaten the food or say something like how the fries are good.  That's not important to me because making great fries shouldn't be that complicated.  I want to know what's not so popular, but really awesome.  I want to know what kind of sucks and people never finish.  Tell me the truth so I don't waste my time and precious calories on subpar food.  She was a good waitress and I didn't waste my time.    I loved the music they were playing.  Upbeat Country that you can sing and move around to...burn off some tasty calories while you eat.  I also liked that the seating was reasonable in a way that there weren't people sitting right next to me staring down my throat as I ate and sang away.  The music was loud enough for me to sing out loud and not have anyone hear me, but soft enough for me to hear my husband.  All in all, this was a pretty good night of good eats and a good time that made me feel like I wasn't hanging out on the strip.  I'm going back again so they better get ready!"}
{"text":"We had the Kiwi Collins and the Cactus Cooler for our drinks and both were great... Our favorite was the Cactus Cooler!!  The service was great and the environment was fun even on a Monday night.   My wife had the sliders that came with incredible garlic fries!! I had the taco truck tacos with steak... LOVED the seasoning on the steak! Would like to see an option to one of each type (steak pork and chicken) instead having to just choose one, but they did not disappoint!   Next time in LV we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kinda like an upscale sports bar. Lots of tv's not too loud though. We came Thanksgiving Eve. Had some friends in town staying at Monte Carlo.  Started w the bbq lettuce wraps. Very good.  My friends had the huge mojito & the frozen lemonade. I tasted both & they were delish. We all ordered the Southwest Burgers. Simple & good, all cooked to perfection!! I will definitely go back.  Service was a lil slow and it wasn't crowded at all but the food was worth it. Place is very clean and everyone that we encountered was friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing \"roadhouse\"food! The Bacon Candy, Chicken Nachos, and Brisket Sliders  were all really amazing! We were happy that we made this choice. The drinks were fine. The Tito's Mule was ok. The ginger beer that they use tastes very \"molasses like\". If you're into that very spicy version of ginger beer, then you'll like it. Other than that, I'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"First time here, the menu looks good, the ambiance is fun you can sit inside or out.  Victor was our server and he was really nice and gave us great service.  We tried the loaded potato skins; Fried Potato Skins Topped with BBQ Brisket, Smoked Pulled Pork Cheddar Cheese, Pico De Gallo, Cilantro Sour Cream, Scallion.  Not bad but you get 3 small potatoes for $15, definitely not worth the price but it's on the strip.  The fried chicken comes in 3 piece or 7 pieces.  I asked what pieces come in the 7, Victor said it's assorted and you may get two or three of the same pieces.  When we got ours because we shared the 7, there were 2 legs and all the rest were small thighs, NO breasts.  Overall the taste was ok, it was not the best nor was it the worst we've ever had, it was ok.    We also had the garlic mashed and macaroni & cheese.  Overall it was just ok but definitely not worth $27.   It's not organic and if it tasted amazing then it would be worth the price but in this case, no it was not worth the price.  This is an ok place if you are stuck on the strip but being a local, this is a place I would not go back to, however, this is my opinion not my recommendation.  I recommend you give it a shot and leave a review of how you felt your experience was."}
{"text":"I'll just ditto the other 4/5 star reviews here.  A casual place with great service and decent food. Hey, could they put more brisket on my sandwich sure.. but...uhh.. this is vegas.   And when you have been hiking down the strip, this is a great place to stop for a quick bite and a few drinks.   Will stop back on next trip"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite of the burnt ends and it was very good!  The Bbq sauce is very tasty being a touch tangy & sweet. But not overpowering of the meat flavor.  The cornbread muffin served along side the burnt ends was delicious as well !   Very moist with a touch of sweetness and the texture being very consistent. The crust is nicely crunchy and the inside being very fluffy.  Good tasting food and a lively atmosphere for a Monday evening in May.  Nicely done!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"As a Texan, I was skeptical of finding decent BBQ in Vegas. The pulled pork was amazing! Loved the potatoes too! And do yourself a favor and order a drink. Their cocktails were awesome. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is the price was a tad higher than I'd hoped. But hey, I guess that's just Vegas."}
{"text":"Great ambience and delicious  smokey flavor in all you order. I'm guessing game they cook in a firewood over and it was a blast in my mouth. I had the tacos and OMG. try the raspberry basil drink, very refreshing and has a balanced delicious taste. The bartender was awesome  so bad I do t have his name to do a shot out. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I was here on opening night, and despite it being busy, service was friendly and took a reasonable amount of time. Ambiance was lively & fun.   Not too impressed with the food. Ribs were OK- pretty tough and very lightly sauce covered. Biscuits and gravy were gross- I couldn't even pinpoint what the watery gravy was seasoned with besides salt. Biscuits themselves were also tasteless.   Despite it being busy, there was a lot of standing around I observed from the wait staff, but being new, that is to be expected until they get into stride."}
{"text":"2 stars for Amazing ON THE STRIP ambiance and open wall.  But it ends there.  Went here with a big group, and not one thing stood out.  Which sucked. Big Birthday Dinner and I think we nearly ordered everything on the menu.  But, we definitely enjoyed eah other's company more than we did the food.  Except for the Ribeye, that was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is excellent all the food and service wonderful. The best part is the bartender that does a great job his name is Tige.Also Preston the chef came out to see if everything was great and it was"}
{"text":"This restaurant and bar was a convenient place for appetizers or dinner before a Cirque De Soleil show. Cover band was good and created a very fun atmosphere. It seems like it becomes a bit more \"clubby\" during the early morning hours. We only got appetizers; the tacos( which were exactly the same ones I ordered at Guys American Kitchen) and the fried chicken bites. I would go again for dinner possibly."}
{"text":"The music is very loud and can't have conversations. The service is terrible but the chili was good."}
{"text":"Drink was good.  Sat at bar asked bartender about various items on menu.  Everything we asked he told us wasn't good.  He said chicken to much breading, nachos all items on top and not good, etc.  we then left"}
{"text":"We had a great  experience. My husband had a grilled cheese. We shared the wings which are outstanding. They smoke them for two days! Service was great. I will be back to try the baked s'mores."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS      It was Sunday, March 15; and my dad had just flew in from New York. This was day one of my stay cation staying in NY-NY with family. We decided to make Double Barrel Roadhouse our leading meal. We had never tried it. I had walked by it several times when passing by the Monte Carlo. A few hundred feet north of NY-NY, we were now in the shadow of the Monte Carlo trying Double Barrel Roadhouse.      The Double Barrel Roadhouse  website promotes it as the place where country meets rock N roll roadhouse. However, in my eyes the industrial interior with the black ceiling reminds me more of a sports bar and restaurant that just so happens to open up to the infamous Las Vegas Strip.      When we stepped foot inside, the hostess walked us to a table that overlooked the bar. At the zenith of March Madness, the HD television sets played college basketball. It was a loud and upbeat atmosphere where holding a conversation was a challenge. A bigger challenge was staying here after seeing the astronomical prices. Where March Madness was playing above, the menu madness was below. We had expected a remarkable tasting barbecue dinner that mirrored those of Weber Grill and Rock Bottom. But just like gambling in a casino, we gambled and lost.      Just a sampling of the menu shows their astronomical prices. For example on the lunch menu, a cheeseburger and fries is $16, a classic Caesar salad is $12, and sausage gumbo soup is $9. For dinner, the starters (appetizers) are expensive with nachos for example costing $17. Beer is just as crazy. A pint of beer is $8 and a bottle of domestic beer is $7. This isn't a fancy bar that you'd see in the Wynn or on the top of the Stratosphere tower. Besides the astronomical prices, the menu selection is lacking the combinations that several barbecue restaurants offer. I did not see a plate where I could combine brisket with chicken or ribs with pulled pork. Anyways, my mind was set on the half rack of St. Louis barbecue ribs. With a side and cornbread, it went for $21. If I was very hungry, $27 would buy me a full rack.     The half rack of St. Louis barbecue ribs tasted average. They did not knock my socks off. And there was one rib where I had to spit out what seemed like a piece of fat. I used a fork and knife to handle the six  St. Louis barbecue ribs. Between the fork, knife, and cloth napkin there were no sticky fingers. On the plate to the left of the ribs, the French fries were allright. If there was a next time in the near future, I would of ordered the garlic mashed potatoes. This brings up the issue of omitting cole slaw from the side dish choices. I have yet been to a barbecue restaurant that passed over offering cole slaw as a side dish. But, on the Las Vegas Strip there is a first time for everything. And there is a last time for some things.      I understand that there is this expectation that this is the Las Vegas Strip and it is acceptable paying more for less. The reality is that Las Vegas Boulevard isn't paved with gold and there is a World of restaurants in the shadows of its famous resorts. Ultimately, my reality is that when a restaurant charges more, my expectations are higher. After closing the door of Double Barrel Roadhouse, I most likely will not reopen it in a long time."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Monte Carlo so we decided to check this place out as our first meal that evening in Vegas. I ordered a burger and garlic fries, my husband had the ribs and mac and cheese. My burger was alright, nothing super special and the garlic fries were definitely garlicy, but they were also dry and over cooked making them unpleasant.  My husband gave me a bite of his mac and I was extremely jealous that I did not order it too. Honestly, it is up there with some of the best mac and cheese I've had. I think it would be even better if it had jalapenos in it. So this is my reasoning for giving it 4 stars. because the mac and cheese was awesome! We wanted to come back another night just to have it, but there were too many other options to try out and didn't have time to come back.  The drinks were almost the price of the meals, so be forewarned."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the service here could possibly get any worse.  Came here on a Vegas trip for a quick lunch before our plans.  We chose this spot because of its great location and strip view.  The place was pretty empty, so we were seated as soon as we walked in.  We ordered their grilled cheese, assuming it would come out quick.  Wrong.  So wrong.  After about 30 minutes we asked about our meal and our server said he would go check on it.  Our server pretty much disappeared after this and didn't even come to refill our waters.  About 20 minutes later, we still had no grilled cheese.  This was more than enough time for the food to come out if they had initially totally forgotten about our order and put in the order during our first inquiry.  I had to walk into the restaurant and ask the hostess to find our server and to find out where our food was, especially since we had been there for about 45 minutes at this point.  Another 20 minutes went by and still no server and no grilled cheese.  I went in AGAIN and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager finally came out and we explained to him that 4 pieces of bread with cheese should really not take over an hour to come out.  He assured us the food was being made, which is basically what we had been told the last hour.  We watched about 3 tables sit, order, eat, and leave during the 1.5 hours we waited for our grilled cheese.  90 minutes later the grilled cheese came out.  After all this, I would hope it would've  at least tasted good.  Wrong again.  The only good thing about this sandwich was that I had asked to add avocado to it.  Other than that, it pretty much sucked.  It was super heavy, greasy, and just didn't taste good.  Making a grilled cheese sandwich is so easy and simple.  If they couldn't get this right, I don't know if they have a fighting chance in Vegas.    Then we got our bill, which was totally wrong.  The girl at the front entrance had given us a certificate for 2 for 1 beers.  Of course, we were charged for both these beers.  After yet another visit inside to find an employee, and another complaint, our meal was finally comped.  During this entire ordeal, not one employee, including our server, came to ask us if we needed anything or to refill our waters.  This was possibly the worst service I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"Food was average.  Service was average.  Atmosphere was good.  We got the smoked chicken Cobb salad ($13), not much flavor to speak of but a decent salad and large portion.  My husband got the brisket with Mac and cheese ($19) and said the meat was mediocre and the Mac and cheese was good.  Probably wouldn't done here again given all of the options vegas has but it was an ok meal."}
{"text":"Great place on the strip! The nachos are very good. The beer selection is diverse. Ask Kim, the bartender, for a recommendation. She will surprise you with a great beer choice! 5 star service! Thank you Kim!"}
{"text":"Meh. Come for the location and music vibe, eat if you need too.   Good cocktails and a nice little night-club scene on weekends. We caught live music mid-week this last visit which was nice, especially right on the strip with that great people watching.   Your typical unamused and unintersted LV Strip servers; just tryin to get you in and out..  The burnt ends were good in a juicy bbq sauce, mashed potatos were surprisingly tasty, cornbread was just ok, but the fried chicken was just not anything... The layer of deep fry was so thick and peeled right off into a bigger pile than the chicken meat I tried to enjoy.  Not sure what we expected because my boyfriend and I are picky about fried chicken but now we know I guess.   I'll be back for the vibe and drinks, maybe an appetizer..if in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on July 18 Friday night with a few friends. Started off pretty cool but had to work my way into the bar and when I got there the bartender saw me but by passed me.  Okay I thought she will come back or someone will.  NO  she didn't so then we moved to the other side and the same bartender came to the other side this time I was hoping she was going to help out..... NO again so then I moved the nasty cups off away from in front of me so she knows I need help.  This Asian little girl need's to smile or get another job tell me what do you want!  really????????? I just wanted my drink! told her what we wanted AND also told her we have these coupons deal that there passing out in front. She stopped and said why didn't you tell me this before..... I was done right then and there! we still paid and still tip but we left!  I'm not going to fight with someone that has a bad day! or will mess mines up but really they should sit down and talk to her about her customer service skills.  Never coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here!! The bartenders here are excellent! Especially Jmoney and Erka (not sure it spelled her name correctly)! They were friendly, attentive and efficient! The atmosphere is laid back, spacious and fun. We sat at the bar and got the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and the jalapeño cornbread. Everything tasted fantastic! Flavored perfectly. We also got the absolute bear schooner cocktail which was good. Jmoney made me a customized cocktail which was one of the best I've ever had! Definitely recommend this place! And sit at the bar!!"}
{"text":"Ok..I'll start out with what was good .  The ambience of the restaurant.  Vegas atmosphere...and sports bar right on strip.  Here we go, beer and drinks are way over price.  8 dollars for a beer !! C mon even the nice restaurants in Paris Casino does not charge that much.  If the food was great ok go ahead charge that much then.    On to the food then.  Again I'll start with the good.  Nachos are good.  Had chicken street tacos. Chicken was smoked, taste like plastic.  The tortillas was worst, taste old and like chalk.  Arrrh and you get 4 small ones look at the picture.   The worst part of this experience $17 for 4 of these 3 bite a piece street tacos WTF. !!!!!  Friend had the bar b que burger.  Wholly cow the meat was red to medium cooked.  That was not how he ordered it. Again $ 14 bucks for this.  The really only good part was getting %20 off.  We gave the waiter 20 percent tip, not really his fault the food was horrible !    If ya wanna hang out at a Vegas on the strip bar and pay sky rocket prices for crappy food this is wat you get.  Beware !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food was absolutely terrible! I ordered Ribs and can not describe how disgusting the food was. I took 2 bites and couldn't stand any more. They sure fooled me because they look mouth watering. I was famished and my wife ordered chicken, who can go wrong with chicken right, so I decided to share her meal and AGAIN I was disappointed. I gave my food away to a homeless person on the strip but felt bad I even subjected him to this mess. The staff was rude any my tip was to get better food and service!!"}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good. Did not get service for about 10 minutes but they made up for it. BUT then I go to walk out of the restaurant.... mind you NOBODY is here. And they tell me to go walk through the restaurant to exist the other side. Get a grip. Won't be back. Don't offend me as I freaking walk out. Management - empower your employees with the ability to act on common sense and judgment...."}
{"text":"The service is terrible and I didn't get any further than that.  The hostess wasn't smiling or friendly and she seemed annoyed at having to seat us. The place was busy, but not too busy. We sat at a table right next to the bar. We watched 5 different waiters walk by us, make eye contact with us and keep going to the bar area where they just stand around talking to each other. After sitting there for 15 minutes without one person acknowledging us, we left. We walked right by the hostess who was busy talking to another waitress and didn't even notice or care that we were walking out. I would never give this place a second chance even to try their food if this is how they treat customers. I work in the customer service industry and this was mind blowing to me. The only place in Vegas where I had terrible/nonexistent service. Shameful."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and really good food. Menu has been updated based on what is currently on Yelp.  Service was good and all the food we ordered was very good.  I had the brisket and the smoke was very good on it. The group also had the fried chicken that was moist and a good taste, not a lot of breaking but enough. Also the double barrel burger was cooked as ordered and delicious. All around a nice place and with fair pricing. Three meals and drinks for $67. It's a go back to place."}
{"text":"Only been there once, 4pm on a Friday, so it was pretty quiet. Service was ok, I've read it can be bad but it was fine, but they weren't busy at all. Food was excellent. I mean, it's a burger/ribs joint so it's hardly fine dining but for what it does, it did it well. My southwest burger was juicy and delicious and the garlic fries were excellent. Pricey for what it is, but it's on the strip...... My buddies ribs were ok, a little over smoked. Would go again."}
{"text":"What a joke they changed ownerships change their prices higher the selections are worse the owner should have kept it where it was that before that's why they bought it I won't be back to this place"}
{"text":"This place is great for men. It has a road house theme, lots of tv's, 3 bars, and large american portion meals. If you check in here on Yelp you shall receive a 20% off your bill.  We ordered a Southwestern Burger with fries and the side order of mac n cheese. The burger has sauteed onions and chili peppers inside, if you enjoy spicy food then this is the burger for you, definetly a good amount of spiciness. The mac n cheese is so far the best i've tried. It has a great cheese sauce and plus more cheese toasted on the top."}
{"text":"I had a blast here! I was a little bummed that you could not access this place from inside the Monte Carlo where I was staying because it was pouring down rain when I went. I ended up getting soaked walking here. Regardless of being wet/cold, I enjoyed my food.   My friend and I enjoyed a few apps and a pitcher of apple cider. I highly suggest trying the sliders, they were really tasty."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave bad reviews, but I gave this place an honest shot, 3 times to be exact & this last time was the worst.  I'm a Vegas local & live steps away from this place, came in opening week and had a bad experience, I just kinda though mmmm maybe they're just not ready yet. Gave them some time to maybe get situated, came back for a late dinner the 2nd time about two months after that & service was food was less than mediocre once again. Stayed away for months.   Went back again this past weekend, walked up to host stand, waited there about 10 mins with another group, employees were having their own convo, laughing it up, finally we get seated. Ordered some appetizers, the chicken wraps & the nachos, which were both very mediocre & totally not worth the $34 I paid for two apps (better off just stopping in @ Maestros Ocean Club in Crystals & getting some high quality apps for the same price).   No straws, no utensils, asked for extra plates twice, two different people, finally came when we were down to the last bite. Asked for check took about 15 mins to get that as well. Felt like the waiter hated working there & really wanted to go home.  Great location & venue but operation is poorly ran overall, staff is very inattentive. 3 visits & I haven't seen one bit of improvement since opening. Hope they change something quick, sad to see a new amazing venue fall apart so quick."}
{"text":"Service was good, appetizers were good, the brisket was so chewy it gave me TMJ, the burger that was ordered was practically raw, and was likely a frozen patty.  Too pricey for the quality of food,  go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm sorry has nobody had good BBQ before!?! This place was horrible! And I mean horrible! People are raving about the garlic fries, I'm sorry but they're just regular fries, not special whatsoever! Let me reiterate, HORRIBLE BBQ! OH and the mac and cheese was to die for, like literally! Puke!"}
{"text":"This is my go to bar when I want to watch football and dont feel like hitting a sports book. There is generally plenty of room, reasonable food and drink specials and the staff is very friendly.  Only reason that I don't give 5 stars is the food is lacking, its on par with a Red Robin or applebees at best."}
{"text":"Double Barrel Restaurant - We stopped at the Double Barrel for a quick lunch on a long walk on the strip seeing the sites.  We had burgers, salads and fries which were all tasty and affordable.  They have a great bar and the building opens at the front for semi-outdoor dining.  The service was good too.  We liked this place"}
{"text":"This was the first stop on our journey into Vegas. The husbeast's Boss had rented the place out for our corporate event, so unless they had the name tag around their neck and dressed in 70's fashions (1770's or 1970's as it was) people weren't welcome.  Inside this open format eatery, we mingled and listened to the -WORST- dueling pianos I've ever had the displeasure of hearing.  I have no problem -What so ever- with bawdy humor, or with dirty jokes, but when -everything- out of the mouth is sexist and a for of sexual objectification, it gets old REALLY fast.   That and the pianos seemed to be out of tune, or the speakers were up WAY too loud or perhaps the sound system was just out of balance. What ever it was, they sounded HORRID. They were difficult to listen to and made that portion of the evening unpleasant.   The food, on the other hand was quite good. There were several vegetarian options like veggie lettuce wraps, Thai style tacos, a delicious mac & cheese -so good. There were pork sliders and some very tasty quesedillas. everything that we ate was nommy! it was just the atmosphere that the pianaists created that made it uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan because it's just a typical themed restaurant/bar with at best average quality offerings. It's just like Diablos. But if you want to just get meh drinks and food that costs more than it's worth, then this should do the trick. Nothing special."}
{"text":"We went to Double Barrel Roadhouse on a rainy day on the strip. We tried the bbq and had a burger. We ordered a pitcher of beer as the alcohol prices are a little high. I would go back again we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Overall good experience.  Got here at 6 PM on a Saturday during football season and it was surprisingly not full, which was nice.  Many TVs and a huge screen at the far end of the place.  Service was prompt and professional.  The BBQ was good, not great, and a bit overpriced.  The specialty drinks were quite expensive for what you received. We ordered a $25 mojito which initially came without a hint of rum and we sent it back,  They did REALLY correct it, as it came back basically as a mug of Bacardi."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...great atmosphere and fun vibe.  Service was Sooooo bad.  I mean slow, not attentive AT all and understaffed.   On a positive note, the food was pretty good..came out a little cool but that was mainly due to the wait staff taking forever to get to it.  We had such great experiences at almost every place we went in Vegas...this place was disappointing.  So many great places to go, I would pass on this one."}
{"text":"The food here is really delicious with a reasonable price. The burger came out with a lot of flavor but the sweet potatoes fried was salty, next time I will remind them not adding any salt. The chicken lecture wrap was delicious & high protein low carb. All are good here!"}
{"text":"**** 20% military discount ****  DBR is more of a sports bar than a cocktail bar. Lots of TVs tuned to preseason football. Nice!!  We thought the burgers and garlic fries were awesome, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food excellent location three bars and plenty of scenery!  Great new spot on the strip. The staff is really trying hard to make it cool!  Outdoor seating right on the strip so you can watch all the freaks walk by!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit here for the last 25 min, no waitress or any kind of service at all , I took a chance on this I place because of the music and sidewalk view , next time I'll bring a 6 pack because no one would have noticed anyway  oh well , I'll take my money elsewhere and unless you like terrible customer service you should do the same . If I could give - 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Went there before a Vegas Knights hockey game. Slow and rude staff and food was not good. I had the pork sliders and they were dry, but greasy ... however you make that happen.   Staff seemed untrained and management presence obsolete.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"On the fence with a mixed bag of deliberation.  Let me first commend the hostesses. Great opener to the first-time visitor. Extremely friendly, courteous, and genuinely enthusiastic.  We ordered the loaded BBQ nachos, crispy (deep fried\") meatloaf, cheddar cheese grits, fried catfish sandwich, crackling pork shank, and BBQ brisket.  The best part of the meal was the appetizers. That meatloaf and nacho boulder were a phenom start.... (that meatloaf should be on every deathrow prisoner's bucket list).....  .... then it went sideways and slightly downhill like a 2-bit skateboard park. The catfish was too salty, brisket too dry, and cheese grits too...... out-of-a-cardboard-box tasting. The one saving grace was the pork shank because....... how the heck can anyone screw up pork at a BBQ place?  The live band was very ordinary (seriously, how do you mess up \"My Sharona\"?), but the highlight throughout the night were the double barrel dancers that kicked their heels throughout the night up in the rafters, as well as waddling and 2-stepping throughout the restaurant...... a very welcomed distraction.  Because this is an SBE restaurant, on top of the fact that a Vegas bar is expected to be high at these menu prices (yeah they're not cheap folks), my expectations are high, and therefore rating standards are tough on this one.   Cocktails were decent, but ridonkulously high-priced for the small quantity, and Bar service was slow. They also need to work on sound engineering and accoustic construction (waaaaay too much audible turbulence for a restaurant), and the air is far too thick. I think it has something to do with fog machines, but whatever it is, airflow is very stale and we eventually left because of headaches.  That said, I won't take away from the general fun atmosphere of the place. The dancers really brought a great dynamic to the place, and there was no shortage of gawking diners. It was sort of reminiscent of the days when the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders could send any place into a high-octane frenzy when they toured the country and were a one-of-a-kind breed back in the day.  From a epicurean standpoint, skip this place if you're expecting anything more than a basic BBQ roadhouse joint. But if you're in the mood for group fun, you'll probably like it.   Will I come back? For partying? Yes. For food? Meh..... we'll see...."}
{"text":"We ate here while staying for the PBA World Finals. The food was ok, the prices fair, the service was very good. I think they are closing soon. Give them a try !"}
{"text":"J money (j Pennie) TY & Cadillac ready (cheeseburger ready) are freaking hilarious !!! If your in Vegas u must stop in and visit these three . SUNDAYS are a must!!!!! I couldn't stop laughing my sides hurt ."}
{"text":"After looking over the menu online, we were excited to give this new-ish place a try. After waiting more than double our quoted time for a table, the hostess finally came and talked to us and made it quite clear that we were a very low priority for her because they were also hosting some sort of industry event.  (So then close for the night!  Or, if you are going to be open, be ready to serve actual customers!) We finally gave up and went to The Henry at Cosmo and had a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Double Barrel tonight on the Vegas Strip. Now I know what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas but this is soooo big I gotta share it  Bryan J was our server and he was excellent. Friendly but not obnoxiously so and helpful, making great food recommendations, and kept a good eye on the table. Great job Bryan  Food was 3 stars but Bryan pushed the experience to 4."}
{"text":"In Vegas for my niece turning 21. She choose Double Barrel for dinner. We loved it and had a great time.   It was Saturday about 6pm and we waited about 10 minutes but we were a group of 15 people. The service was great. We ordered nachos, potato skins, ribs, chicken salad and hot links. The ribs were excellent!   Only giving 4 stars cause it was very loud and for the Grandparents it was hard for them to hear and follow conversations. But we were drinking and celebrating so probably adding to the loudness!  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The garlic fries, OMG...most amazing fries I have ever had.  We got shrimp and sliders, great food for an OK price. Seemed a little pricey, but you have to expect that on the strip.  We did get 20% off of our bill simply for checking in on Yelp.  Definately will go again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a rather large group of 12 but the waiters kept forgetting things we ordered such as not bringing my friend's beer that we eventually had to cancel and not bringing half of our group's dinner. Overall the ambiance is fun an the food is good. I highly suggest you get the catfish sandwich"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch about 1pm. Service and food were great! We had the pig candy for an appetizer  my husband had a vodka and Red bull to drink. For our meals we had the brisket sandwich and ribs with a side of sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. The ribs were excellent. The mac n cheese was sooo yummy! Oh and it came with cornbread which was yummy to. Great experience here and I would definitely come back. Perfect place to come eat with the great weather...open patin style seating. Our server was Nicole P."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch while walking the strip, and we were pleasantly surprised.  My only con was that they were short staffed, and we waited a while to get our drink orders. However when our server did come he was awesome (guy from France).  The garlic fries are heavenly.  I had street tacos and my sister had sliders.  We cleaned our plates. The only thing I didn't like was the massive mojito, it was 25 dollars and was totally bland.  Not worth it.  I would totally go back here, though"}
{"text":"Went in here to have some drinks and we ask then is if they can change the TV to see Mexico vs USA and they were very accommodating.  Our bartender Double D mixed us up some great drinks.  All I had to do was ask him to make me a drink with a certain ingredient and he did! Dude made me drink with balsamic vinegar and that drink was bomb! Overall the prices are a little pricey but who cares your in Vegas right? All in all great customer service by the bartenders and of course great drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and had less than a 10 minute wait. Wasn't too crowded around 2 p.m.  If you use the My Vegas app on your phone for slots or blackjack they have some pretty cool stuff on there to redeem for your points and they had a buy one get one free coupon for this place through the Monte Carlo.  The hostess was nice and our server started out with a bit of an attitude because we told her we were using a coupon and wanted to start with waters while we looked at the menu. Needless to say it took her a while to come back and take our order. Once she realized that we actually wanted alcohol her service was much better. Had to take away a star for the initial rudeness, but can't give less than four because of the wait and the food.  For being a lunch menu, they give you a lot of food for a good price. The three meat platter came with chicken, pulled pork, ribs and a side. The meat was very tender and the BBQ sauce was super tasty. Their garlic fries were delicious. I got the jambalaya which came with four huge shrimp on top, you could seriously get three reasonable bites out of each one. And the Jambalaya also came with a side, which I couldn't finish. The mac and cheese was good but nothing to write home about. They also give you biscuits to start and they come with honey butter which is really delicious.  All in all I can definitely say that I'll return, but I won't be upfront about my coupon usage in the future."}
{"text":"For being on the strip, this place didn't leave me bankrupt. Came here on a Friday night for dinner with my kids, drawn in by the upbeat loud music, and our hotel was really close. For a Friday night, the place wasn't as busy, we were seated almost right away.   We had the pasta primavera with chicken, the Ny steak,  the hangover burger, one soda, and two beers. My bill came up to 120 and some change! Not bad consideringI got a steak for 37 bucks. (Which I know isn't terrible for the strip).  The only thing I didn't like was that weird tomatoe salad thing that came with the steak. I tried to ask to have it changed to something else and the waiter said I couldn't."}
{"text":"Great experience there. We were in Vegas to celebrate three birthdays including my own. The outdoor bartender Johnny alone made it a place I'll definitely come back to. Super knowledgeable about the menu and even though he was attending to everybody it seemed like he was our personal bartender. Food was also incredible, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I made reservations a week in advance. I received a call from the restaurant three hours before our reservation canceling my reservation.  They said they had a private event schedule and offered me a slot an hour earlier. This is completely unacceptable! You can't tell me they were not aware there was an event scheduled until three hours before. I have never eaten here, and I NEVER WILL!"}
{"text":"I visited the Double Barrel Roadhouse at 9 pm after the show, Zumanity, at New York New York. I believe that the closing time is 10 pm, but they still have  many consumers at 10 pm.  The mood is casual and very nice. I ordered 8 piece of chicken wings, their signature, side salads, and beer. Those were much enough for my dinner. The wings are very good for beer, and I loved them.  Oh! Club time began from 10 pm!!! I spent good time there with fun music and good mood!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing good service however waited almost an hour and a half to eat.  They are only concerned with serving alcohol."}
{"text":"Bummed that they could not accommodate A party of 6 on the patio on the strip.  Seemed like it was the attitude of the hostess, not policy.  Not sure.  Especially for Sunday night!  Food, once they finally took our order and served us was good!   Issue is more with attitude of servers/waiters, not actual food.  Also, they need a kids' menus!!"}
{"text":"First time here... our table had ribs, wings, burgers and chili....all excellent. Great food and great service (by Chris). And the manager, Megan, stopped by also to make sure all was ok. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We've got some friends in town and decided to come here as we are headed to NYNY to gamble and drink.   The pre-gaming here was a good idea as we hit the awesome happy hour.  We enjoyed some great food and some great beer.   Stephanie was our server and she was way cool! Our food came promptly and the drinks were flowing"}
{"text":"Yikes, for being such a hot spot on the strip the service and drinks sure did Suck!  I ordered a stella, it was brought out maybe 15-20 minutes later. The beer lines were definitely dirty and my beer was garbage. I had to return it. Got a vodka redbull because how can they mess that up.  My gf ordered a beer as well and here's was the same, had to be the lines. Any bar should know to clean their lines constantly. I ordered the beef brisket and had to return that as well, it was so dry even the bbq sauce couldn't save it. I was extremely disappointed in how long everything took and the quality. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Sad cause it looked like so much fun from the outside."}
{"text":"This place was just okay...the brisket wasn't as tender as I would have expected, the garlic mashed potatoes were good. My husbands burger was good but nothing worth writing about...wouldn't return."}
{"text":"WoW!!!  This place is off the hook!   Love, love, LOVED it!  We met up with a group of friends and had the most AMAZING dinner here last night.  We were all SO impressed that they have only been open for 4 weeks and didn't miss a beat.  The service was exceptional, the food was soooo delicious, the portions were perfect, the ambiance was just what we needed to start a fun night in Vegas"}
{"text":"Stopped here on accident actually. We were looking for a specific restaurant but we were having troubles, so we decided to stop here instead and we are so glad we did. This place was amazing! We had dinner here on a Friday night and we were lucky enough to get a table on the patio right by the sidewalk. Our server was great, very friendly and helpful. Our drinks were amazing and the food was to die for! We had the pulled pork sliders which were the best we've ever had. And we also split the wood-grilled chicken nachos...AMAZING! The best around, in my opinion.  We plan on stopping here every time we go to Vegas from now on.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for American comfort food! Service was great! The fried pickles and buffalo chicken sliders are fantastic! The DBR beer is great too! Hope this restaurant expands into other cities."}
{"text":"Cool bar, unfortunately the area (Monte Carlo, or what used to be) is completely torn up. Beer selection is limited."}
{"text":"Love the garlic fries! Good booth seating available; restaurant is located adjacent to Monte Carlo on the strip. Skip the dry chicken tacos and go for a burger. The flat iron steak with biscuit is also tasty. The honey butter for the biscuit is yummy. Good choice for an American meal."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is very cute. I would go to have a drink and maybe an appetizer. We had dinner and weren't very satisfied. The server was very nice. I had the roadhouse nachos. I didn't seem to be able to find anything appetizing on the menu so I chose Nachos. They came on a cookie sheet. On top was cheese, pulled pork in sauce that was to sweet. It said it had baked beans on them as well. I had him put them on the side. They were cold and to sweet. The sour cream had wasabi in it. I truly did not like them. My friend had the mini pulled pork sliders. He said they were good but agreed everything was to sweet. This is a cute place and good for drinks and appetizers only."}
{"text":"A big group of us wanted to watch the NBA playoffs. This restaurant helped us by making room on a busy Friday night. The service was lights out. Our server, Wendy, was on the spot before we ever needed her (even though she had a 13 top next to us).   I had the Buffalo sliders, yum.  We also tried the chicken lettuce wraps which were great. But the mac n cheese? Wow!"}
{"text":"Place needs to get its story straight. Scam.  False advertisement. Come to Texas and let us teach you southern hospitality and a real mans word........"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Monte Carlo and decided to eat here and catch some of a college game before going and seeing the George Strait concert.  Really wasn't expecting much from a burger place/bar located on the strip. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and that was primarily Due to the fact of the professional service we received from our server Rachel.  Rachel did a fantastic job of giving us a menu tour and recommending things that we should try for dinner. The four of us in our group each tried something different along with getting appetizers. The food was served hot and it was extremely tasty. Throughout the entire meal Rachel continually check back to see if there was anything else she could get for us or if we needed our drinks refill.  Highly recommend this place for a late lunch or a couple burgers and a cold beer and a chance to watch sporting events. We had great service and appears to be the norm for this organization."}
{"text":"Initial wait for food was on the long side. . . Luckily it was delicious in every way! Buffalo wings had a slight BBQ flavor to them, not the traditional buffalo sauce, but it created a unique flavor."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! Had an amazing meal - buffalo chicken sliders are UNREAL and the nachos are perfect!! We also had some fried pickles that were not on the menu - but were awesome!! Love this place! Will def be going back!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best fried chicken! Anytime we are in vegas we stop here to eat. Great drinks too. Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Don't bother.   I've never Yelp'd, seriously this is my first time.  But........this place sssssuuuuuucccccckkkkkkssssss!  Was a BBQ place, now it's food.  Whoever bought this place and changed it to this bs should be drawn and quartered.  Loser!"}
{"text":"I like this place - great atmosphere, convenient location, and quality food! I'll never understand why you can't bring in an outside drink, particularly when it was purchased at another MGM property?? so as long as you know that going in you'll be set."}
{"text":"Worst Serice on the strip. Served a Moscow mule in a glass. Handed us buy one get one free coupons. Then told us that they didn't apply to the drinks we ordered. The wings weren't bad."}
{"text":"Not a great place, burger was average should of went to In n Out, and their fried chicken lacked flavor.  Good place to watch a football game."}
{"text":"Worst bar on the strip.  We came to watch the games for March Madness. They have 7 TVs in the bar area all on the same game, and the manager said it was impossible to change even one of the TVs because they were all on a schedule.  Are you kidding me? Don't come here. Bad service, incompetent management, and somehow they ran out of beer by noon."}
{"text":"The atmosphere looked inviting as well as the option of al fresco dining, so I thought this would be a good choice. The menu was available to look at outside the restaurant for quick viewing. Prices didn't seem terribly steep so my husband and I tried it out.   Food quality was pretty good. My husband's ribs had a lot of fat on them. Looked edible until he tried to take a bite out of them. I got BBQ chicken which was just okay. Not worth $19.   Service was terrible. Ran out of sweet tea and coke quickly with no sight of our waitress. It wasn't even terribly busy. A bus boy brought us water and another waitress had to take care of our check. The original waitress came by at the very end as we were leaving because she thought we hadn't paid."}
{"text":"What can I say. The food and service is terrible. We had the \"chefs favorite hands down\" fried chicken. It was $40. It was flavorless, tiny, heavily breaded, and completely void of spice. The potato salad and biscuits were awful too.  A group of 6 of us all agreed that Popeyes many times better. No one ever asked us how it was and we had a few prices left. We called over the manager who told us \"well you are it\" and told us she never head that before. Really? we all laughed. There's a huge sign that says satisfaction guaranteed.  They charged us full price and made no apologies. Unless you're just drinking. Go anywhere else. Lots of good food around. The managers name is Leann that said that too. she should be fired."}
{"text":"LOVED the BBQ here.  I had the brisket.  Shockingly, they did a good job.  I had very low expectations being in a casino on The Strip but their brisket was very good. They smoke all the meats in house so you get that heavenly smell when you walk in.  The sauce was perfect to me - a little sweet but more tangy than sweet.  They also had good wine by the glass, so rare in BBQ joints. I also tried the mac n cheese - yummy!  My BF had the ribs.  They were tender and juicy, well seasoned. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Owned by sbe, like all of their other properties on the strip this fell a little bit short.  The venue and atmosphere is nice but the food was mediocre....I fuck with BBQ heavy so if your going to do a roadhouse joint on the strip you better come correct. The drinks were good though.   We ordered:  Samy Boy's BBQ Chicken - Ok...some parts of the chicken were dry though....  Mac & Cheese - Good but who could fuck up mac & cheese....whoever does that needs to close their restaurant hahaha  BBQ Beef Brisket - Again for some reason a little dry no idea why....  BBQ Smoked St. Louis Ribs - Probably the best thing we had besides the drinks. Done decent enough to order again...  Watermelon Crawl - Bomb ass drink   Cactus Cooler - Delicioso again  Blvd. Bulleit - Great drink  Overall the drinks are good but the food was ehh to get a 4 star or higher the bbq game needs to be stepped up"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to sit outside and people watch while having some drinks and food.  We were given discount drink coupons before going in so thought this might be good.  For what we were looking for it pretty well fit the bill.    The drinks were not watered down like I was afraid might happen with the coupons. and the food was really good.  The Jambalaya was really authentic tasting with a good bit of heat, just the way I like it.  My wife really enjoyed her Spinach Salad also.  So that part was all good.  The bad part was bad.  First, the service was ridiculously slow, they could have sold us several more drinks if we would have ever seen our waitress.  I took forever for the food to arrive also.    Don't know if it was an accident or on purpose but when we got back to our hotel my wife noticed an extra entrée on the ticket that we didn't order.  So if you eat here be sure to check you ticket before paying.  The food saved this from being a total disaster."}
{"text":"For $20 a plate I would hope for better service and better tasting food. The service was very slow about getting our food out, and got a few of our orders wrong. (not very apologetic about this) Also there wraps a pretty plain and have no flavor. I was hoping for more spice, or to taste something interesting for the price I was tasting. Very Meh, not really impressed at all."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Awesome drinks! Killer burgers!  Ask for Sylvia she is da' bomb! Great open air to outside!  Just past the Monte Carlo!  I suggest the double barrel spiked iced tea!"}
{"text":"Located right on the strip with great food and great service.    My wife and I spilt the boneless buffalo bites, they were very good. Then I had the sliders with fries , again very good. My wife got the Caesar salad that was alittle plain, then again she didn't want any chicken or shrimp added, it was just lettuce with dressing in a bowl. But other then that it was a great atmosphere very friendly service and good food would definitely  recommend."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Food and atmosphere way better than \"The Pub\" (inside MC by pool/shops).  Took the coupon in for 2 for 1 drinks.  We split $11 lunch special, pork sliders with a garden salad.  Sliders were tasty and salad was very good.  Great for strip people watching, would return (use a coupon)"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas staying at the Monte Carlo and my wife wanted to try this place all weekend.   We went Saturday night and ordered two beers and burnt ends.  The service was slow, the waiter was rude, and the food was bland.  We drank our beers and left as I had enough when it took 25 minutes for the waiter to come back to us for a second drink.  You think it may have been busy, no there was plenty of empty tables and servers just standing around.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place and go to Diablo's instead."}
{"text":"Yes, it's kitschy, and a little on the pricey side. But the burgers... Good lord, they are worth the money. The drinks are stiff and the garlic fries are phenomenal."}
{"text":"RUDE hostess- treated all customers poorly - had many open tables but was very picky on the count of people in your party to seat there- \"NO\" was her favorite answer with a sour-puss face included.  OUT OF ALL IPAs- I have no words for this, how can a restaurant by the name \"DOUBLE BARREL\" on the Strip, be out of all IPAs? Waitress stated it was because \"people really loved the IPAs this weekend! MEAT NOT SMOKED- the restaurant claimed to smoke their meat but their chicken and Burt Ends tasted like meat with a hint of flavored smoke... If you're  a foodie, u know what that means! LOL Adding smoke flavor seasoning does not mean you smoke your meat... Just saying LOL PRICES SUCK A$$ For WHAT YOU ORDER-see picture of receipt ... It explains itself!"}
{"text":"Great place for delicious BBQ for a reasonable price on the strip. We ate here twice during our week in Vegas. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Chris the bartender was amazing, he makes great drinks behind the bar and is very nice, very wise gorgeous man. I will def come back."}
{"text":"One word... Delicious! I've been here twice and I love the food, atmosphere and service. My favorite item is the Pulled Pork Sliders. I also highly recommend the appetizer tower because everyone at the table can pick their apps. I love sitting on the patio, especially during the evening when there is live entertainment on the Monte Carlo plaza."}
{"text":"I kind of love it here. First off they have the best fried pickels I have ever put in my mouth!! Like it's amazing. It's a pretty cool place to hangout. The patio is right on the strip and it's the perfect place to be on a warm Vegas night. The cocktails are great too. The service is always good. Great find."}
{"text":"Busy place to get some food make sure to be waiting around 20 min before you get served. Then not even that feels like this place need more staff. I went here for food and from the time I was sitting until the time I got to order was 20 min and during that time no one offered water. However I ordered the burger which was suppose to include salad, tomato and pickles didn't come in the burger? Nope I need to tell the server ( It's not servers fault that the kitchen did) So by the time I was half way done with my burger the salad, tomato etc came great. Anyways they even had hard time to fill up water for me and took away my empty glas with water before I even moved from the table.  So the place is great but more server will be good because just looking at the staff running around way to fast makes me to be stress with the food"}
{"text":"Sept.  3rd,  2014... 8:52pm.  We were just at this restaurant  with a party of 10 (including  kids)and the reaction from the hostess  stand was enough to make our entire party leave.  The rolling of the eyes and the look of \"really?!? \" on their faces showed us how much of an inconvenience our party was on them. After booking our room at Hotel 32 at Monte  Carlo..  VIP Room..  32nd floor.. It has been a great day and awesome experience  for our whole family until we went to Double Barrel Roadhouse...  THANK YOU DOUBLE BARREL FOR RUINING OUR AWESOME EXPERIENCE  HERE AT THE STRIP!!!  IF HAVING KIDS WAS SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE TO YOU THEN JUST TELL US. DON'T HUFF AND PUFF, WHILE ROLLING EYES BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO TRY AND EAT AT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT!!!! Will never be back."}
{"text":"Anytime new restaurants open they seem to go through an adjustment period.  Most times the service is spotty and the food may not be that great.  Very few times have I seen restaurants open and everything run perfectly.  It is what it is.  People need to not be so tough....  Anyhow, this place has now been open a couple of months (max) and I think they've worked out most of the kinks.   The space itself is very nice.  It's open to the strip and there is also a nice patio (Vegas needs more of these, even though it's hot).  Definitely some great people watching to be had.  The hostess and servers were all very friendly and helpful and made suggestions on the menu.  I was in the back bar area, where apparently they also have their own stage with band and DJ equipment.  They periodically offer live music, yet another thing Vegas needs more of.  I had the BLVD Bulleit which is made with Bulleit Bourbon, fresh mint, lime juice and ginger syrup.  I really liked this and found it pretty refreshing.  Although I couldn't have more than 1, I am not a big hard alcohol drinker. Their draft beer selection could use some work - there was nothing special about it and it was full of \"typical\" selections (Sam Adams, Bud Light, Shock Top, Stella Artois, etc).  I was excited to see that they had Steigl Grapefruit on their bottles list.    For food I had the BBQ pulled pork sliders.  The order comes with 3 and bread and butter pickles.  Overall they were decent.  The bun was nice and soft and the pork had good flavor, although I found the bread and butter pickles to be a little overwhelming.  They weren't the best I've had, but far from the worst either.  For dessert I had the \"pie in a jar,\" and chose the lemon meringue flavor.  It was only OK.  I thought that the meringue was a bit dry and too burnt.  Not something I would order again, but it was worth a try. I'd like to go back and try the peanut butter version.  Overall, I like the concept and the vibe of this place.  While I found the entrees to be overpriced, the burgers and sandwiches weren't too bad.  It's to be expected while on the Strip.  This place is owned and operated by SBE, so it becomes more of a rowdy bar environment at night.  I think over time they will continue to tweak things and improve."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. WHAT A RIP. DONT GO HERE FOR FIGHTS.  I came to see the fights, and they have a $25 cover charge, no big deal. I ask to sit down, as I'm an hour early. I'm told I can't be seated until 5 pm. No big deal, can I reserve a table? Nope, they never do reservations, by five pm all the tables will be clear its first come first serve. I line up at five, \"I'm sorry, this table (the one that only shows a couple screens from one side) is the only one left.\" Can we move? Nope, the rest were reserved. -_- but I can't reserve a table. Fine, whatever, we can all sit on one side of the table. THEN they tell me that, just FYI since you've already paid the $25 dollar cover charge, I should mention that there's a $50 dollar minimum. I'm pissed, because we paid $25 each and weren't told, but whatever the four of us will drink more than 50 bucks. Oh no Miss, it's $50 per person. We just sat at the bar, watched the fight, left and will NEVER go back. Served me right for trying to work with local businesses. The bartenders were super nice smart and made REALLY good drinks but the hostess was beyond rude, and the owner? He said shut up, I'm doing you a favor, I don't have to seat you...then what the hell did I pay for? So damn rude. Oh I forgot the best part, the bar has a screen that drops down so the people who paid can see but everyone else can't. They won't let u bring drinks through the screen, even though it's the SAME bar and they will let you transfer the tab. We even had the same bar tender. Good job, such a respectful establishment. MAYBE if it's a normal night it's okay. But DONT come here for special events.  Edit When I came into the bar, they gave me vouchers for buy one get one free on specific drinks, I ordered the drinks listed and was told, sorry that doesn't work during fights. Doesn't say that on the ticket. Such a tourist trap."}
{"text":"This place is not cheap, but neither is any other place in Vegas, so I will not factor that into this review. The service was decent. The portions were generous and I thought the food was good. We shared the brisket plate and the nachos. Not the best BBQ place in the world, but I would go back."}
{"text":"The food is good,well prepared. Nothing was over cooked,the presentation was good nothing extreme. The price of the food and drinks are fair to good priced. The customer service was great,our glass was never empty. The music and atmosphere went together perfectly, all of the servers were very polite. Band was great as well!"}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas is truly amazing! As a local we usually try to avoid the Strip as much as possible unless family is in town. So here we are walking the Blvd & decide to grab a bite to eat & get some cold beers. Walking by this place with the NFL game on, music playing, people hanging out & eating it just seemed like a slam dunk!   Checked with the hostess for a table & they had a 20 min wait so we sat at the bar & got service right away! Our bartender was so friendly & the game was on in front of us so we didn't want a table & we ordered food there.  The 4 of us all ordered something different & everything was on point! The burgers were cooked perfectly as ordered, loaded nachos came out as described (it's huge), pig candy is every bacon lovers dream, & the wings were meaty, juicy, & flavorful!   The husband & I will definitely be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Decent cheese and chicken quesadilla. Good Guacamole and chips.  Decent tender chicken and potato's. Pretty good chicken wings with lots of choices for sauces.    We were lured in by old Menus on this site. THERE IS NO MORE PIG CANDY, brisket nachos and many other things from old menus."}
{"text":"Bleh. Mediocre at best. The server gave us all these suggestions and we were so excited about it. The catfish was under seasoned and the bread was way too sweet (catfish sandwich). And the macaroni looks cafeteria style and too salty. No one was overly happy with their meals but it's not the worse food I ever had. Nonetheless there are much better places to go eat in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch on a Sunday, during football.  We were lured in with a coupon for Buy One Get One Drink Free or something of that nature.  But if you are a real YELPER...CHECK IN.  I Checked In and got a 20% off the entire bill deal.  It was alright.  The service was slow, but she was friendly.  The food was pretty good.  The Nachos, whatever version you get, are goddamridiculously humongous.    I got the Brisket Sliders, Boyfriend got one of the chicken sandwiches, his daughter got the Buffalo Chicken Sliders.  Large portions of everything, no way we could even remotely begin to finish everything. Food was all good, not bad, not breaking any boundaries or blowing my mind.  But good.  Root Beer for the under 21, was $5  lame.  Not that we normally go anywhere with anyone under 21 in Vegas, but she goes to UNLV (I am sure she was not gonna bust out her fake ID in front of her Dad LOL), so we were meeting for lunch.  I don't think Vegas should ever charge for non-alcoholic drinks, ever.  Anyways, it was a good meal.  I don't know what the place is like at night....can't tell if it would suck or not.  Kinda seems like a daytime place?  But I don't know, we didn't go by there at night ever."}
{"text":"Got a buy one get one free drink coupon and our drinks were good. However, we were sorely disappointed in the fried chicken and mac n cheese...."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we couldn't decide where to eat... if you are in the same boat, keep walking. there will be many other awesome places to eat on the strip.   i ordered street tacos, which were bland and not put together well (i hate it when tacos fall apart as you are eating them...).  The menu is pretty all over the place as far as food styles (i guess that is what American means?) but i kind of interpreted it as \"nothing is really all that great\" but maybe we just didnt order the right things.  Service left something to be desired.   it was fun at least because of the open wall to people watch folks walking up and down the strip. for the cool decor, atmosphere etc. it gets some bonus points."}
{"text":"Double Barrel robbed me of my money, time, and life experience.   We paid Double Barrel a huge sum of money and we had a group of 100+ people. They brought 3 plates of small sliders and they ran out of food faster than Usain Bolt runs the 200 Meter Dash.   I was expecting Double Barrel provide me with food so I could get to see Tiesto in time. I almost missed Tiesto because I had to run to McDonalds and nourish myself and the girl I brought. She later vomited because shitty food and vodka do not mix.   Thank you Double Barrel. Thank you so much for everything."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, not great either, would not eat here again. We had a group of 4 and sat outside to enjoy the beautiful view they have. That was the only good thing about this place.  The service lacked and was slow and our server could barely answer any questions we had about the food other than saying \"oh you will love it\". Well $18 for sliders l, I better love. But to my surprise, it was a waste. They were small, greasy and a true waste of anything more than $10.  We also got the nachos, which you would expect to be shared amongst 3-4 people. Nope, small plate that had greasy store bought cheese that tastes like it was microwaved.  And $14-$17 for a cocktail? Go next door to CVS, by a bottle and use that instead.   This place is a true vegas rip off and not worth it. Go down the street another block to better eating options which may cost the same, but you actually eat what you paid for."}
{"text":"Tried this new place on a lim they were handing out buy one drink and get another free, drink coupons so I was like well lets try them out. We got seated right away which is alway good thing. Then our waitress comes and was very polite to us and recommended some drinks for us to try. I ordered a draft beer which is usually a good choice. Then we had ordered the pretzel bites, and two burgers, they were really good they listens and made them to order like I like. They came with everything and the French fries were cooked just right not over done or under cooked. The pretzel bites for an appetizer were good and the cheese dip they use was really tasty. The whole time our drinks were kept filled and the waitress made sure we had everything we needed. They were also very friendly and was happy an glad we stopped in and will probably bring others back here to try them also. There were other menu items that I wanted to try."}
{"text":"I don't know what is with the bad reviews this place is getting; Double Barrel Roadhouse is awesome! So awesome, in fact, that my husband and I ate here 3 times during our 4 day stay.  Part of this was attributed to the fact we were staying at the Monte Carlo and couldn't step foot on the strip without being offered 2-for-1 drink cards for Double Barrel, and part of it was attributed to us just really liking the place.  It reminds me of a frat house.  A clean frat house that serves amazing food.  They have pool, air hockey and beer pong and non-stop upbeat music, mostly top 40s.  We heard Nicki Minaj, Miley, Daft Punk, Beyonce, Usher and the like.  Our service was always wonderful and the food always quick.  My husband ordered a burger.  I can't remember which burger it was, but he said it was hands-down the best burger he'd ever eaten, and he got it every time we went there.  I'm not big on red meat, so I didn't try it, but I did sample his steak fries that came with the burger. Delicious and perfectly crisp!  I got the buffalo chicken sliders which came with two tiny sliders for $12, but they were delicious and I got those every time we were there, too.  If you go during lunch, you actually get the same sliders and a half salad for only $11 total, which is an excellent price.  They have a bathroom attendant situated between the men's and women's bathrooms where the sinks are located, which I found kind of odd considering the atmosphere of the place, but it's a nice touch.  One of the attendants, who my husband said was named Javier (but he was drunk because hey, it's Vegas!), let him borrow a lighter after he bought a cigarette off of him for a $1 tip.  That was nice and was above and beyond what should be expected.  I don't have anything bad to say about this place.  We will definitely visit again on our next Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"Not bad, will probably find myself here again but would not necessarily go out of my way to come back here soon.  It is very loud when the band is playing, so sitting down for dinner not such a great idea when that is going on - for those who wanted to drink and dance it was probably great.  Food wise the friend chicken came out cold which was a disappointment, however the waiter got it taken off the bill.  The pulled pork platter was really good, unique mustard bbq sauce - sweet potato fries on the side were a nice side.  Prices are pretty reasonable for food and drink."}
{"text":"Had there cheeseburger which was okay and sub sandwich. I rate the food as just average. Not great for the price. I should have picked up on a Saturday night at 9:30 and lots of open tables. Never a good sign. Staff was friendly but nothing that just stood out. Not a wide variety on the menu. Probably wouldn't eat here again...."}
{"text":"Place was OK when it 1st opened. Now they don't have pool tables and closed half the place down. Guess having high prices and rude bartenders might be the cause of that. The service is slow and the food is so so. I can see this place closing down this year for sure"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool.  What I liked most was the atmosphere.  Completely open to the strip.  It was a little expensive but great appetizers and beer.  The nachos were delicious. Walked by later on and a girl was dancing on the bar.  Missed that show for my meal."}
{"text":"The racks and mash potatoes were great, but the service was horrible. The staff there was not so friendly. In order to validate the 10% off check in on Yelp, the waiter said we must give them a 5 star rating and leave good comments. They will literally sit there and watch you write your review. There was nothing on the Yelp that said this was a requirement. Overall, the food there was mediocre and I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice open ambience where you can get away from the haze of vegas cigarettes. Food for lunch is reasonably priced and served hot. Plenty of televisions to watch sports. Good food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I recommend the Mac and cheese and the chicken nachos. Everything else was terrible. We had a 9:30 reservation for dinner and the music was at club level--we were told it becomes a club at that time of night. I literally couldn't hear the person sitting next to me at the table, even wen shouting.  Very slow service even though it wasn't busy. I probably would have given it 2 stars but the bill came and they had added an 18% (that's fine) plus a \"service charge\" on top of that. Management insisted this was normal business practice in Vegas. I call it fraud."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place. Great atmosphere and great food. Haven't tried anything that we didn't like yet. Service is always friendly and quick. Great spot to people watch on the strip."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, the drinks are pretty standard, the ambience is great and the service is very friendly.   In a town that isn't las vegas, this would probably do fine. Unfortunately, this is Las Vegas where there are far too many options available to eat 'ok' food. It is in a busy area with lots of good people watching and your steps away from the monte carlo which has pretty decent tables."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Right on the strip next to Monte Carlo. Food was excellent and so were the drinks. Fried Twinkies were legit. I would recommend this to anyone especially the pulled pork and mustard sauce. Sounds weird but worth it"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and loved it. The food is good and prices are reasonable for Las Vegas boulevard. The menu is not too long but everything on it sounds good. The place makes specials on beer, buy one get one for free. The service was a little slow and my salmon burger didn't include fries like in most places."}
{"text":"We went here Friday night and it was super busy but we had a great time. We were well taken care of drinks, food was great, live band was awesome! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try...was walking by looking for a place to eat. Quick service, got a table in no time. Food was pretty good, nothing amazing. Good place to stop by for a beer and wings."}
{"text":"Came here randomly on a trip to Vegas. Food was delish!!  I ordered the nachos with beef and pork brisket. Highly recommend. Indoor and outdoor seating available."}
