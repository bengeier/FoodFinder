{"text":"My favourite Italian food in Little Italy. Make your own pizza or try the walnut pesto pasta.  This place is a constant favourite every time we order."}
{"text":"May 9, 2015, Party of six with reservations for 8:30 pm and needed to be finished by 10:15 pm for a birthday interactive event.  Arrived on time.  Waited 35 mins for drink orders,  (never asked for a second order) which at the time we also placed are complete food orders, one app of caesar salad and and mussels, and basic pizza/simple pasta entrees by each of us. Drinks arrived 20 minutes later, with an olive and bread board as an apology.    Never been to an Italian restaurant where bread/olives are an \"apology\", but rather a standard staple.  At 9:30 pm I asked would are food be showing up soon or shall we be stuck just doing take out and eat in our car?  Answer:  we will try and get it out by 10:00 pm.  That would give us 15 minutes to chow done our dinner.    At 9:45 pm the owner/server/bartender said our entrees would not be ready before 10:00 pm and would we would like some quick appetizers so we would not go hungry to our interactive event.  Well seriously what could we do? MacDonald's anyone? We were brought some apps at 10:00 pm and the table wolfed them back as we were starving and had to dine and leave.  Nothing else was complimentary, but we were told the table of 12 that-showed up at 8:00 pm still did not have their main course either...like I care should that be a saving grace, others at a RESTAURANT are hungrier than us?  In 1.5 hours you should be able to serve your customers a full course meal including dessert and coffee.  We got one drink and appetizers to share.  The restaurant could have made $300-400 off our table if they got there their act together.  The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is what few appetizers that came out were tasty - caesar salad is perfect - with the exception of the mussels, which were very small in size, but the tomato sauce topping was excellent."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Terrazza you had better go now because this place is quickly becoming a favourite among patrons in the ossington/harbord/annex area. Not only is the food delicious (we have tried everything from the pizzas (whole wheat option), paninis, pastas, salads, desserts) but we love the atmosphere and the sense of community and family in the restaurant. The service is always impeccable and they make you feel at home. The prices are very reasonable and probably the best value in the city. Great patio for the summer time too. Give it a chance you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is one of my neighbourhood favorites! The food is excellent and home cooked - I always get the pizza, which is thin crusted and crispy and the dough is flavourful without taking attention away from the rest of the ingredients. Friends have ordered the paninis and the pasta and they were always raving about how delicious they were. The service is awesome, too - last time I went we had a few food allergies at the table, and they were very patient and went above and beyond to make sure that everyone still got an excellent meal."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant many times on the way home and it looked pleasant, so we finally decided to try it out.  Great decor - I can imagine how lovely it will be when its warmer out and they can open the doors.  The olives they served while we were waiting were tasty - spicy & garlicy...my fave!  We ordered a ceasar salad,  pizza & gnocchi w/ gorgonzola sauce to share.  The ceasar salad was excellent, you can tell the dressing was freshly made.  Not enough restaurants do this nowadays.  The pizza was ok - it was thin crust which I like, but it wasn't crispy.  The gnocchi was ok, the gorgonzola sauce was really rich....needs a little contrast.  I was also disappointed to see they didn't make their own gnocchi.  Overall, it was ok but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"bruschetta 5/5 italian spring rolls 5/5 italiano pizza 5/5  Super amazing Italian restaurant. family run.  great food. Beautiful ambience. Great for a romantic date."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible and are all the wines. The atmosphere is so cozy and romantic. Perfect date night"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere in this restaurant. When you walk in, the whole place smells like garlicy tomato sauce. It made me crave a bowl of pasta immediately. However, they don't have any vegetarian tomato-based pastas, so I had to settle for an olive oil-based dish -- the 'Tomato' - tomatoes, olive oil, garlic on linguine. The linguine was cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh, but I would've preferred more vegetables mixed in. Our server said they are known for their pizza, which I'll have to try next time - they definitely smelled amazing, and you can get any pizza made into a calzone."}
{"text":"Just had a beautiful 30th birthday celebration for our daughter Andrea. Started with antipasto platters cold cuts, cheeses, grilled veggies olives bread we also had pizza followed by mussels and salads, and for the main veal in a mushroom sauce and grilled chicken served with vegetables. Food was delicious and plentiful. Very attentive staff eager to please. Thank you Frankie and Madison and the rest of the staff a good time was had all. The Neal family"}
{"text":"What more can I say? I love Terrazza. The restaurant, the food, the environment... Frankie, you're restaurant is right up there with the best Toronto has to offer in my mind.  If you are in the area or want to try something different visit Frankie at Terrazza and tell him Nick recommended you to his restaurant. I haven't tried the same thing twice yet because I want the full experience and Terrazza has yet to disappoint.  Lunch or Dinner, the food is magnificent. It's fresh, always updated and my mouth is watering as I write this review.  The wait staff is very friendly and everyone has a personality that is inviting, exciting and fun. When I ask for recommendations, they are more than happy to list their favorites and Frankie always comes to personally see how my meal is. He cares and is always open to suggestions; I like this in a restauranteur and restaurant.  Go on, give Terrazza a try, it's sure not to disappoint."}
{"text":"I've lived in Little Italy for 10 years and Terrazza is the best Italian restaurant in the area hands-down! They have the best bruschetta and fantastic pizza - even the whole wheat dough is wonderful. The pizza is baked just right; they're generous with toppings and have excellent sauce. Their latte was a perfect way to end a great meal.   Even my father was truly impressed and he's been eating at restaurants for many, many years! In fact he went back the very next day.  They have a lovely patio and the service was excellent. I highly recommend Terrazza."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting the restaurant that I had found doing some online searches of good Italian food in Toronto. Everything from the service (so attentive and friendly) to the food was amazing! We ordered a bunch of salads to start which were large and delicious, and had Margherita pizza as the meal which was very tasty and had the perfect hints of basil! The tiramisu for dessert was huge and really yummy! I can't say enough about how friendly and personable the staff is here!   The restaurant is such a cute little space that is very well decorated and taken care of! I would absolutely recommend this place and I will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city!!! Such a great atmosphere, especially for dates. My fiancee and I have been here on many occasions and I have taken lots of family and friends as well. No one has ever complained. Jason and I will usually get 2 entrees, an appetizer and a bottle of wine and it is always under $100. Such high quality food, for a low price. I would suggest this to anyone and I have!!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly, family owned. Perroni on tap. Cocktails we're large and tasty. Bread and olives were terrific. My wife and I had pasta dishes, clams for me and tomato pesto. Winter salad was very good. Large fireplace, roaring fire."}
{"text":"Dined at Terrazza with a party of 4 on a Saturday night around 9pm. We walked right in without a reservation and were sat in a great booth near the back. Our party ordered jess' lasagna to start, the lipstick burger, the Verde pizza, the Piccante pizza and penne bolognese. Everything was great. This will be my new go to spot in the neighbourhood for pasta.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Normally I'm put off by an italian restaurant hawking burgers, but this place is legit."}
{"text":"I've walk and driven past a million times never really sure what kind of spot it was/if it was open or not- it's got a lot of foliage in front of it.  I was a sorta-fan. Service was attentive. Space was really nice- prices were reasonable. Food was...OK. I'm gonna give it another try though because those other factors made for an enjoyable experience.  We started off with the \"Italian Spring Rolls\" - which was arugula, parmesan, and green onions wrapped in prosciutto, with a balsamic based dipping sauce. It was about exactly as you'd imagine it- maybe bigger than you'd imagine so don't order it just yourself (see the photo submitted by Michelle A for reference).   We had the plain tomato pasta and a sausage/grilled zucchini/caramelized onion calzone. Calzone was a bigggggg one- came with a little bowl of better than average tomato sauce to dip in and some chili oil. If you finish everything on your plate- you're in serious risk of a being a fat fuck.  The pasta was plain, but by no means bad (I guess there's less to do with just tomatoes and olive oil- everything involved better be top notch to make it memorable).  The restaurant has a small patio along Harbord which looked OK-  but you should probably go for the more comfortable chairs/tables along the open garage door windows inside....up a little higher, and with all the greenery right beside you makes you feel like you're somewhere in Italy eating something sorta OK."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I at here twice in 2014 - so this review is not up-to-the-moment current, but still worth sharing in case they haven't made adjustments since then.   This place benefits from a good location and a very cozy, sunken dining room with a fireplace. It's a nice place to go after work for some simple and \"fresh\" food. I say \"fresh\" because there is something oddly formulaic about the food. Maybe it is just your typical Canadian-ized version of Italian food - it's fresh but not hand-cranked pasta kind of fresh, if you know what I mean.   On my second visit, I had a pasta dish with chicken in it and discovered my first bite of chicken to be almost raw inside. It ruined my experience and it was a bizarre mistake for a place that wants you to think it knows better.   If it is family-run, there are no obvious signs of it in the kitchen or at the front of house for that matter. Maybe that's where my frustration with this place lies: there is something authentic missing in the food and its preparation and my experience with the undercooked chicken confirmed that.   Sadly, I wouldn't return unless I happened to be in the neighborhood and was just having a drink & apps by the fire."}
{"text":"If you want delicious Italian food make the turn off the Ossington strip and come here. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the food was amazing. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We visited Terrazza for the first time about a month ago and it was excellent. We were served water, olives, and bread with oil when we sat down. I'm not usually an olive person but these olives changed my mind. Spicy and garlicky is the perfect way to serve an olive.   My friend and I shared the house salad and the picante pizza. The salad was delicious, fresh greens with a house made vinaigrette, and a perfect compliment to the spicy, garlicky, thin crust pizza. Note that we love spicy food, and this is a very spicy pizza. Often we'll order food and a restaurant will say it's spicy, and it's not really very spicy. This is really spicy. It was excellent. The service was perfect, just the right amount of visits to the table, and the waitress was very friendly. The water glasses were filled up regularly, which is really nice.   The ambiance of the restaurant is great, it's not too loud to have a quiet conversation with your friends.  We went back a couple of weeks after this visit and the waitress remembered us. Everything on the menu looks great but we ordered the exact same thing because it was so great the first time. It was just as great the second time.  We went back last night with the resolution to try something different but unfortunately didn't make it there before the kitchen closed, so we'll have to try again another night."}
{"text":"Super good -- never met a bean salad I liked until now.   Lovely, simple Italian food. Family owned, great service, charming patio.   Oh and not to be a dirty old man, but the waitresses are smokin' hot."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a while. Great food, phenomenal atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant after a recommendation from my daughter's boyfriend. I initially called and booked for 10 people and then had to cancel five of them. They were very gracious and accommodating. Met the owner Frank who made us feel right at home. The Shrimp linguini was delicious. My husband had the pasta with Roma tomato sauce and although it was good it could've used more salt.  Watermelon and Arugula salads were also very good...ambiance very nice, especially with the doors open allowing us to enjoy the fresh outdoor air!  Next time definitely trying the pizza....looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Ambiance- Beautiful, comfortable and relaxing, nice small outdoor patio as well. Service-  We were a party of 8, service was okay. Slow. Diligent on offering a first drink, but after that sat the evening with empty drinks, no offers of refills for anyone. Food- Not very impressed. Frozen pasta not fresh pasta, another in our party had 2 tiny, I mean tiny, pieces on lamb burnt to the crisp, another in out party had dried, cooled off pizza delivered. Really with I had taken pics it. Would I go back? Nope, not for me."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, service and food. I will be back! I love the garage doors, the cosy fire place and the friendly atmosphere. When I first walked in, you see the kitchen at the front door, the waitresses were busy so I asked the chef if there was a menu, he walked all the way down to the restaurant and back to give it to me with a smile. I love to see that hospitality from the back of house to the front. The waitresses were knowledgeable and the food tasted fresh and delicious.   Then almost at the end, I heard my favourite reggae song! Along with a lot of other great tunes. I am sticking to my statement: this is my new favourite place. Thanks for the great night Terrazza, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been to Terrazza on several occasions with friends and family.  The food and service is always top notch. The atmosphere is comfortable and warm. Bread and hot olives - delicious - garlicky and warm.  Get the chocolate cake - it's amazing and fresh - it's a perfect balance of sweetness! Pasta is amazing!  You (or your guests) won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After fully digesting my experience, my torn desire to give it a 4-star rating was swayed by a number of small negatives: bread service wasn't provided until requested, the mussels arrived not steaming hot, and both pasta bowls came with sauce way too heavy.   Biased by personal preference and taste, I had envisioned a homemade or authentic Italian flavour to my shrimp pasta; however, the sauce was disappointingly bland.   Their pizza however, would be their specialty. Next visit, pizza only."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite neighborhood Italian!.  Great food! Great service! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had been biking past this place for months (never encounting anyone parked in the bike-lane, FYI) and thought it looked really cute. So, judging this book by its cover, I dragged my husband out for dinner a few weeks ago. It was a strange experience to say the least. First the hostess told us to wait at the bar, even though there were tables open. Then the confused bartender took us to a table that was just inside the great big open windows. The atmosphere here is really lovely, it must be said and that would likely be my main reason for going back. We ordered some drinks and then our meals. The wine selection wasn't extensive, but it was good. We both found something we were interested in. Then we got our appetizers. The bruschetta was delicious, but the \"Italian Spring Rolls\" were something I could have done without. Then the waitress brough my husband's dinner but didn't seem at all to notice that she didn't bring my food. A few minutes later I had to ask someone about it and she had indeed forgotten to tell the kitchen. So my husband ate his dinner before it got cold and I waited. My husband had a pizza that was perfectly respectable, but nothing special. Once he finished, my gnocchi in a gorgonzola sauce arrived. This is usually my absolute favourite dish. I adore gorgonzola cheese and pretty much anything made with it. This dish, however, was horrible. The sauce was boring and the gnocchi were mushy. I don't think I even managed half of it.  So, the place gets two stars because it's cute and I would go back for appetizers (just not the \"spring rolls\") and a glass of wine. I don't think I would ever bother with dinner again."}
{"text":"We'd been meaning to visit Terrazza for quite some time. It has an endearing story from the owner printed on the menu. The food was excellent, exactly what you crave when you feel like homemade Italian! You can smell the food from a block away. We ordered the bruschetta which was a great size for sharing and each had a pasta dish. Both were so flavourful and the pasta was perfectly al-dente. The patio is very quaint and garden-like. Our server was attentive and service overall was excellent. We were even offered a complimentary dessert for a slightly longer-than-average wait time for our main courses (which we hardly noticed in the first place!).   We can't wait to return. This will definitely be a new neighbourhood favourite!"}
{"text":"Everything here deserves five stars - the ambiance, the service, the drinks and the food. We both ordered \"create your own\" pizzas. All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and the crust was perfect. The big portions meant plenty of leftovers to take home. Our server was friendly and prompt, and had a great sense of humor. All in all a fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place & dropped by the restaurant on a Thursday afternoon at 5:10pm. There was a table of two who arrived just before me. I ordered the La Familia platter of cold antipasti. The other table got the complimentary bread and olives, I got nothing. Fair enough but I continued to sit & watched the other table's cooked mains arrive around 5:25pm. Then the other table moved inside 5 minutes later to escape the wasps.  5:50pm arrived & no food insight. l'd had enough and went inside to find the place empty save the table for two. There were 3 guys in the open kitchen. No my platter wasn't ready ....it was almost ready. I waited another 2 minutes while they made it a to go order while one of the cooks told the crew that I was being unreasonable. I paid & left. Serious fumble, don't bother going if you want your food anytime sooner or later, or ever"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here on Sunday.  attentive service, intimate space, great food, big portions (without being excessive), and excellent quality. This is definitely one of those hidden gems. The antipasto plate was enough food for 3 or more. Some of the trendier beer bars I've been to around town have much smaller antipasto plates and charge much more. I would recommend this place to everyone I know. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating dinner here last night for the first time. Every time we pass by the restaurant is packed, however when we stumbled in it was completely empty.  Shared a La Famiglia meat and cheese board. A delicious collection of treats, but would have liked more variance in the types of cheese served. All three cheeses were tasty, but similar.  The pizza (salami, red pepper and Gorgonzola) was fantastic. Thin crust and cooked to perfection.  Wait staff were friendly, attentive and helpful with suggestions.  10/10 would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"White wine mussels are probably the best in all of Toronto. Pizza, pasta, salad - doesn't matter what you order, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"I came here recently with a large group for a friend's birthday dinner.  The service was pretty terrible and the food was average. The pizza was thin crust, but part of mine was quite burnt (it's thin crust not in a Neapolitan pizza kind of way, but in a crispy/cracker way.. so burnt cracker is not tasty). The toppings were delicious, though. My friend's pizza with a non-burned crust was good, and the pastas looked alright, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. As for the service, the waitress who was serving us seemed constantly annoyed with us, which was honestly quite uncomfortable. A number of weird things happened, but one of the most frustrating was that she seemed to rush to put things down and get away before we had the chance to ask for anything else, and she wasn't really checking in to see if we needed anything, which made it tough to order more drinks/food etc. Another guy came and served our table for a second, though, and seemed awesome, so I think it's possible to have an entirely different experience here. Be warned, there's also a 20% auto-gratuity for large groups, which was pretty annoying given the poor service we received."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Terrazza a couple weeks ago when my husband and I went out to dinner with a couple friends. We went there because my friend's boyfriend really liked the pizza there, and because I always enjoy a good wood fire oven pizza, we figured we'd give it a shot! I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the food.   We had a reservation there, and we ended up sitting in a really nice booth at the back of the restaurant. Aside from the bachlorette group that was there making a bit of a ruckus, and the poor music selection for background noise, the restaurants atmosphere was pretty nice.  Once we were seated at our table it took a bit of time for our waitress to come by to get our drink orders. (Our friends had arrived before us and got their first drinks at the bar, so I'm not sure if the waitress just assumed we all had drinks...) Once our waitress came by to take our drink order it again took some time to get our drinks. We ordered a bottle of wine, which was brought to our table and opened so that we could taste it. The waitress then poured one glass of wine and left. While this wasn't a fine dining establishment, I kind of expected the wine to be poured for us.   Between the four of us we shared the Antipasto Platter, the Bruschetta and the Arugula salad. Each of these was delicious, and each was a very healthy serving. I'm sad to say that we didn't finish it all because we wanted to save room for our meals.   For our main course 3 of us ordered pizza. I had the Tuscany pizza, which I thought was very delicious. I can't recall what pizza the other two ordered. All of their pizzas sound delicious, so I don't think you can go wrong. As for my friends boyfriend, he ordered the one of the penne pasta dishes, which came with a very runny sauce, not what would have been expected of a cream sauce. When finished it just looked like a bowl of cream soup. Given that experience I would recommend sticking to the pizza.   We finished off our meal with a dessert of spanakopita. It was very delicious, though somewhat difficult to eat!   Overall, this was an okay experience. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area who is looking for a good pizza. I would not go out of my way to go there again, but I did really enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"To celebrate my birthday and our 15th anniversary, Gord and I had supper at Terrazza.  When I moved to Toronto 30 years ago, I lived a block away from this restaurant.  Back then, though, it was a burger place called Lips.  For $5, you could get a burger, fries and pop.  It was a great deal and good food!  I moved away from the neighbourhood and didn't go back again.  It's on my route to work.  I saw it had changed styles and put it on my list of places to go.  It turns out the place is back in the family.  Our server started us off with warm bread.  Yum!  It was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  They usually serve it with olives but Gord's allergic to olives.  Gord ordered Spinach Pesto pasta and added chicken.  He said it was really good and he'd get it again.  He ended up taking some home.  I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and sliced tomatoes.  It was a really good pizza.  The dough was soft and chewy.  It was cheesy and there was lots of pepperoni and tomatoes.  It tasted garlicy, which I liked.  I too took some home.  I felt like something sweet ... and it is my birthday after all ... so I ordered Homemade Chocolate Cake.  Gord had the berries, a bit of ice cream and a bit of cake.  Yes, I ate the rest.  It was good ... definitely hit the spot for sweetness.  Our servers were friendly.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been by this place literally a thousand times, but never been in. Finally broke down, and was very pleased!   Very quaint, lovely ambiance. Didn't have appetizers, but the bread board with olives was fantastic. I created my own pizza (arugula and prosciutto) with whole wheat crust, and my guest created her own calzone. Both were perfectly cooked, and the thin crust on the whole wheat pizza tasted great. Would definitely return, just note they do not take American Express."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian and service every time. The chicken penne pasta and goat cheese sauce dish is literally the best dish I've ever had anywhere period. Live in the states but make sure I come here when I visit Toronto no questions asked. The pizza also looks amazing from other people when they've ordered it so I will have to try that soon"}
{"text":"I've been living near this little Italian restaurant on Harbord for a couple years now and decided to go one night with my in-laws and was blown away by how great it was.   Our server was impeccable .. she instantly brought us over fresh warm bread when we ran out of ours, was attentive and provided some great recommendations. Between the four of us, we ordered a charcuterie platter, the bolognese pasta, the spinach pesto pasta, and the mussels. Everything was served hot and was delicious! The wines and cocktails are also reasonably priced and the atmostphere is charming and inviting.  We will definitely be back to Terrazza .. we're sad we've waited this long to try it, but happy that we've discovered it now!"}
{"text":"Terrazza... means Terrace in English, though you'll def. have the choice of eating indoors  ;)  Esp. i the wintertime.  RSVP's recommended.  Modern feel to this open-kitchened Italian restaurant, that plays a variety of Anglo/instrumental (jazz) non-Italian music in the background. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ More plusses than minusses...  +: -fresh crispy romaine lettuce used in their tasty salad; -thin-crusted pizza was above average; -nice bread to begin whetting our appetite with - served with better than average quality of olive oil; -service was good; -there was parking on a nearby street, and Terrazza was only a short walk away.  -: -prices are a bit... $$; -pasta was not made from scratch.  sauce was tasty, but I wish the fettucine was homemade since this restaurant is family-owned and otherwise had good food. don't get me wrong, the pasta was good enough.  It would just have been better if it was made from scratch.   I'd go back... for their Pizza for sures!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch for the first time at Terrazza last month. I was lured onto their Harbord St Patio by the lush greenery camouflaging it from the street traffic. Let's just say I've been back about a dozen times since.  Each meal is accompanied by olives and bread which are to die for. I've ordered the Caesar salad with nearly every meal because of the rich home made dressing, croutons and oven-baked bacon it comes with. The fare is simple but done right. Pizza, pasta and paninni an assortment of salads and a descent wine list to boot. You won't pay an arm and a leg and the service is friendly and speedy.   This place has quickly become my go-to neighbourhood lunch/dinner spot, can't wait till they do Brunch!"}
