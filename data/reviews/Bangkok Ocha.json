{"text":"I have been eating here for years.  While the ambiance is not great, the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable.  I have probably eaten every item on the menu, lunch and dinner, and never been disappointed. 

I am a bit of a Thai aficionado, originally from NY.  Bangkok Ocha is better than most.  I have had better Thai at significantly higher prices in Florida and California.  There are a couple of places in an Atlanta that are as good but overall this is a terrific \"once a week\" (at least) spot.

While I understand reviews are subjective; the details in some of these reviews, what was ordered and the comments, suggest input from Thai posers and dabblers rather than addicts.  I am the later."}
{"text":"Lunch here is soo good!  Their house noodles are amazing. They are perfectly spiced and cooked everytime!  Comes with soup, an egg roll, and tea when you eat in.  All for 7.95. So worth it.  I dont even have to order anymore.  I go so often they dont even give me a menu!  One server is much better than the rest , but nothing beats these noodles for me!!!!"}
{"text":"Friday lunch with the coworkers.

Small little spot tucked in next to the fresh market.
Quaint, but very well ...broken in, you know, kind of like a house that needed a new coat of paint a few years ago.

Even though they were very busy we were seated immediately.
They have a choice of about five different dishes for their lunch specials which range in price from $7.95 to $9.95 depending on the meat.

I opted for the gang massaman curry with beef and since I prefer spicy dishes I asked them to bump it up to 4 stars on the spice level. The lunch specials come with soup, spring roll and drink.

Not too bad, but I personally prefer a bit more green on my plate, when I looked down at my lunch it was completely brown and that just makes me feel like I am not even trying to remotely eat healthy.

Not a bad little spot, not a great spot. Three stars worth from me,"}
{"text":"My kids and I eat here every time we get a chance. The spice is perfect and the curries are spot on and delicious. We skip around the menu each time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good food. Excellent friendly service. The staff were sincere attentive and kind. I ordered the Ga Prow aka Ka Prow Chicken. It was flavorful and spicy with fresh vegetables and basil. The lemongrass soup had fresh veggies and mushrooms. It was also very flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"It was weird eating in the dark.  Vegetarian lunch was bland. I kept dumping salt on it, even though I don't eat salt. It didn't get any better with salt. Meat entrée had more flavor. The soup included with lunch tasted like egg drop soup with bits of canned  creamed corn floating in it."}
{"text":"This is one of my wife and I's favorite spots for Thai food and never disappoints. Its very laid back and the owner and his wife run the place as well as take all the orders. I dont think Ive ever gotten a different server that one of those two. There are many good dishes here and I cant really think of them off the top of my head but make sure you ask what all the ingredients are in the dish before you order. I dont eat mushrooms and one time left them on my plate when i was done...the owners wife asked me why I didnt eat my mushrooms...I kindly replied that I dont care for them and she then said \"next time just say no mushroom\". I think they get a little offended if you leave anything on your plate so, just a heads up there! 

Oh, they also try to upsell you on a drink even though I normally get water when I come here. 

Nice folks, good food, check it out."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience I had with my friends the other night. They close at 9:30 and we got there about 8:50, but they sat us right away and we were able to eat a great meal.  We chose to share mulitple dishes -pad Thai (love it), pineapple fried rice (little bland but great with a touch of hot sauce), spring rolls, house noodles and red curry( delicious). I definitely recommend this place to eat"}
{"text":"This little Thai treasure consistently delivers!  I have ate there and had carry out many times.  The service is excellent, atmosphere is fairly basic and quiet and the food is excellent!  To-date this is my favorite Thai place in Charlotte and I highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here all the time. I would put this food up against any Thai restaurant in town. Every time we go the food is consistently delicious and the owners and waitresses are very personable and friendly. 

Give this place a try you won't regret it. The house noodle dish is fantastic."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai in the Charlotte area. A FIVE stars for the North Carolina area for sure. Satay done right, Tom Kha was done right, the vegetables were cooked yet still a little snap in them as they should be and fresh, chicken was white and cooked right with no gristle. Very surprised to find such good Thai as so many Thai and Chinese restaurants in this area of the country flat out suck. This place was a breath of fresh air. For sure will come again."}
{"text":"Always crowded during lunch time. Food is good but I don't like waiting for 20 mins plus for lunch. I would prefer the Thai House across the street."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant a total of three times.  On the last visit we tried the Kang Dang curry with chicken, Chicken Basil stir fry and Pad Thai.  All were OK, but not extraordinarily flavorful.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the Pad Thai must have been made with ketchup.  The Chicken basil didn't have a strong basil flavor and looked different than I am used to-- it seemed to consist of dried basil, rather than fresh.  Not a lot of Chicken in the Kang Dang, but it certainly contained curry."}
{"text":"I've been eating here on and off since I was in high school, and though it's not my favorite Thai in Charlotte, it's certainly convenient when I'm hanging out with family out that way.  I appreciate that it's family run, and the same folks have been there for many, many years.  (Although avoid the evenings when husband/wife are pissed at each other... screaming from the kitchen...)

Their lunch specials are pretty decent, though I'll concur about the bizarre egg/corn soup.  I usually eat a couple spoonfulls and then decide to wait for the main course.

I got their version of pad thai last time I was there, since they didn't have a green curry on the lunch menu, and I was really surprised and pleased by it.  Generally, pad thai is a little too peanut-y for me, but Bangkok Ocha's pad thai has more of a citrus base and is incredibly flavorful and lively.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Keep it up, folks."}
{"text":"went for lunch. Service and food was fantastic. I will definitely be back. Pad Thai was very good. My wife loved her dish as well. Very friendly"}
{"text":"I like the food here. It's very flavorful. I hesitated to write a review here before because I would've given them a bad one due to their portion size and pricing. However, on my most recent visit I've noticed that they increased their portion for lunch combinations. Even though they're still pricey, at least I'm getting more food. Their lunch deal is definitely their best deal. You get a soup, unsweetened iced tea, spring roll, rice, and main dish. They give you a good amount and it will fill you up. 

I typically order the seafood combo number 3, which is a basil based brown sauce. The sauce is delicious, and they give you plenty of seafood, shrimp, calamari, and scallops. I took away a star because they're a bit too pricey still, but they definitely have good food."}
{"text":"I had one of my worst dining experiences here ever. I ordered Basil Chicken with no bell peppers.When it came, it was loaded with the slimy green peppers. I informed the waitress of the mistake and she called me a \"liar\". Well I was speechless. I can't believe a complete stranger is calling me a liar. I informed her that I could not eat this chicken and that I would like it as I ordered it. With even my friends backing up the fact that i ordered no green peppers, she started screaming at me and calling me a liar again. She said she would make another one, but that I will be charged for both. I refused, on principal, but also what nasty things would this irate server do to my food if a new order was remade. I refused to eat while my companion's ate. Everybody in the restaurant stared at me as tho I had just murdered somebody. It was surreal. At check out, I asked to speak to the owner to see if he would kindly remove my charge. He said he would call the police if I didn't pay for my meal. I was nice and courteous the whole time.  I submitted to his threats and paid for the meal I didn't order and didn't eat. I later called my credit card company and they reversed the charge. 

This is the WORST restaurant I have ever NOT eaten at in Charlotte!

My advice is DON'T GO!"}
{"text":"Just okay... Not great but not bad... The service is quick, can get in and out for lunch well within an hour. The Thai dishes are the usual suspects... The red curry could have used a little more time to thicken but not too runny. Overall a decent place BUT make the trip a little further down towards Ballantyne and goto Bahn Thai! Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl. It's the best Thai food I have ever had and the family who owns the restaurant is so sweet. I would pick this place over any other Thai restaurant any day of the week."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!!!  The BEST in all of Charlotte NC.  

Each dish is prepared fresh and to your exact specifications to what you like to add or subtract to the dish, your choice of meats or tofu or only vegetables.  You can also specify your level of spiciness, 1-5 stars, with 2 being medium.  

You can not beat their daily lunch specials, which include homemade soup, thai spring roll, entree AND iced tea!!

Their service is outstanding and extremely attentive.   You will not be disappointed.  After a few visits, they will know your name and will remember what you have ordered and will ask if you would like it again.

Every time I go there for lunch or dinner, they remember what I will order to eat for that particular day.

A  few of my favorite dishes are the Pineapple Curry Chicken, Basil Fried Rice with chicken, and the Pra Ram (peanut satay sauce over chicken and spinach or broccoli).  Their satay (chicken or beef) is so tasty and juicy, along with the cucumber and peanut dipping sauces.   My favorite soup is the Tom Ka Gai soup when ordering for dinner.

This is one of my truly favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  Give them a try, you will not regret it!

P.S.  A few things I would like to add vs. some of the other reviews, the   Basil Fried Rice **IS** made with FRESH thai basil and it is certainly NOT dried.

P.S.S  There are 8 daily lunch specials that change depending on the day, (but every Monday it is the same, every Tuesday is the same, etc) but if there is something you do not find on the lunch menu or want to order something for lunch that is a special from another day, they will be more than happy to make it for you from scratch for a small additional charge."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Bangkok Ocha when I lived near there and miss is dearly. They have great pad thai, quick service and a better wine list than I expected. Their pad thai is delicious and you an modify it to if you want it spicy or not. If you're looking for a good quality thai place where you don't feel rushed to eat, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I have ever had.  Ordered take out for the first time last night and my \"duck\" was all fatty skin.   The vegetables seemed to have been over cooked for days and for 60 bucks I could have had a much better dinner else where."}
{"text":"Beef house noodle is so gooddddd. Get it every time. The pud Thai is pretty good too. Service is mediocre.. The guy server likes to shout.. One time he startled me asking me from behind \"would you like sprite, coke, Thai tea?!!!\" Kinda funny actually hahah but It's so quiet in there! No need to yell in my ear xD oh also the Thai tea is really good here too!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pad Thai entree and their lunch specials include a bowl of soup, spring roll and drink. The pad Thai has a citrus flavor and a generous portion. You get enough food for two meals with lunch.
I think they also have a good basil noodles dish too. They are tucked into the shopping center near the Fresh Market on 51.  I think they do a nice job with Thai regular dishes.  We like the basil noodles also. Their chicken rolls appetizer are excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been here for take out and sit down lunches and have been impressed both times. I was pleasantly surprised on my recent lunch trip, as I was offered more than I was for take put. Got the Pad Thai w/chicken both times. Great price of $7.95, but when you sit down it also comes with iced tea and a bowl of soup. Soup was a corn based egg drop soup, which was different, but good. You also get a small egg roll. Yep...$7.95! Service is fast too! Enjoy! I'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place. I had heard it was good, but the food was terrible. I got crispy spring rolls, which were flavorless & I ordered the pad thai w/ chicken. It didn't even taste like pad thai. No flavor. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Pad Thai and Curry dishes are insanely good. I definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner. The family owned business is delicious and they make everything in-house."}
{"text":"I am an ethnic food snob. I lived in San Francisco for 6 years and have had the best of the best. Save your money and try Thai Place just down the street. Dinner for two people was $40 with a tip and definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We have a group from the office that frequent Bangkok a couple of times a month. It's great food, great price. Lunch menu is excellent and service is prompt."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in the Carmel Commons shopping center off of Hwy 51.  I've only been here for lunch, many times, and their lunch specials are very good and affordable...$7.54 I believe?  It comes with an entree, soup of the day and iced tea.  The menu rotates so some of the dishes aren't always available but the traditional noodle dishes are always on there.  I really like their house noodle (kind of a mix between Pud Thai and Pud See Ew).  They also have good curry/rice dishes.  Their ingredients are really fresh and the noodles are some of the best I've had from a Thai restaurant.  Lunch on Wednesday is always really crowded (I believe it's because of the hot and sour soup served that day only) so get there before/after the lunch rush to avoid a long wait for a table!  4 stars because they could use some more staff on hand otherwise I'd give them a 5!"}
{"text":"The food was decent however the reason I gave it a two star and not a 5 is because of the service... Took awhile to be seated and was not very polite or friendly"}
{"text":"Tucked away on a shopping strip, latent and nearly concealed is Bangkok Ocha. I've actually never noticed this restaurant despite the millions of times I've frequent this road and passed this exact location. One of my friends recommended Bangkok Ocha and raved that this is his favorite Thai restaurant. Let's be honest, I ignored him. The dull, insipid exterior does not exactly scream \"GREAT, AUTHENTIC THAI FOOD HERE!\" Nonetheless, the boyfriend and I decided to pop in last night and give Ocha a try!

We ordered the stuffed chicken wings as our appetizer.  I must warn you, patience is key since everything is made to order. Boy was it worth the wait! The dish is accompanied with a sweet and sour peanut sauce. Crushed peanuts floated on the sauce's yummy horizon. I added some spicy peppers (\"hot sauce\") and BAM, perfection! Kinda felt horrible, but I couldn't resist asking the waiter for TWO refills on the sauce.

For the entree, my boyfriend settled on the Curry Fried Rice and I went with one of my Thai favorites, Pad Kee Mow (pan-fried noodles stir fried with various vegetables, tomatoes and FRESH basil!). We asked for a level 4 (out of 5) of spiciness for both dishes. The main reason why I LOVE Thai food is the abundance of flavors, herbs and spices.  WOW.. Ocha delivered just that! Not at all exaggerating, but with the first bites into the entrees, all my worries drifted to the ceiling and I was in food heaven! SO many different, yet distinctive flavors between the two dishes. The Pad Kee Mow was steaming of fresh basil. The Curry Fried Rice was what really stimulated my taste buds, the most compelling flavors and spices that I've ever had in a Thai dish. Level 4 of spiciness allowed the perfect amount of spicy that complemented the other flavors and not at all overwhelming. We topped the prefect meal with Thai tea. I couldn't believe my luck, even the tea was more abundant in flavor than other Thai teas I've had. That was it. I officially fell in love with Bangkok Ocha!

The only recommendation I have is to reflect the amazing spice and flavor of the food onto the design of the restaurant. I love hole-in-the-wall restaurants as much as anybody, but the flat decor and exterior does not do this place any justice! The restaurant is nice and clean, but the lighting is dark (and no, I do not mean dim), rendering the place dull. I think with a little bit of color and lighting, Bangkok Ocha will get the attention it deserves! Regardless, the service and food is so amazing that once they get people in the door, they're hooked (noticed most of their customers are regulars that the staff knew by name!)."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha was decent...met our needs but NOT the best in town.  

The lady server bent over backwards to be nice but the man was super annoying and talked to us when we didn't want to have a conversation.

I don't like cooked tomatoes in my Tom Kha and the man almost started arguing with me that they are supposed to be in the soup--but that is NOT my preference--so don't try to convince me against me preferences!

We asked BOTH the man and woman for tea and neither brought it.

We were the ONLY people in the restaurant.

Also interesting: at closing time 2:30, a new customer came in saying he had a large party to feed and they were denied because they were closing.   Yet earlier we heard them complaining that the afternoon was slow... COME ON GUYS stay open another 45 minutes and serve this party!!!"}
{"text":"I have not been to Bangkok Ocha in quite a while... but came to have lunch with my sister here the other day.  We both decided to get the chicken Pad Thai on this visit.  I ordered mine with a spicy level of 3..it was good, but it was not quite as spicy as I had hoped.  The menu is very reasonably priced for lunch.  Service was good.  I definitely need to get back over here for dinner sometime soon, since I really like their version of Penang Curry here."}
{"text":"I don't frequent this little shopping center off of 51 often except for the occasional Fresh Market visit or essentials from Party City. I was happy to find solace in Bangkok Ocha for lunch with a deer chum of mine. Certainly a diamond in the rough for those who have not tried it. 

A quaint Thai resto with a lack of glitz and glam - my kind of joint. All about the food and service. You can't set your drink down without them filling it right back up! So rad. 

Food: They start you off with soup. It's some sort of rice-y, broth-y soup that has a somewhat peculiar color. Off white-ish. Very flavorful and salty. Contains some sort of protein as well. Either tofu or chicken, but not certain. 

I ordered the Pud Kee Mow. One of my favorites at any Thai place. Flat, pan seared noodles with veggies, chicken and plenty of spices. The flavor is very earthy and peppery. Huge portion for lunch, too. They give you a nice spring roll with your entree that isn't incredible, but definitely a nice touch for an already generous meal. 

Me and my buddy ate for just $18. Not too shabby, in my opinion. 

Definitely will be back for lunch again soon. This city has so many Thai options and I'm happy Bangkok Ocha is one of them! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Charlotte

I've been eating here on and off for over 15 years.  Food is always excellent as is service.

I get a dryer style green curry calked choo chi primarily vegetables and I add shrimp.  We also never miss fresh rolls.  My wife a house noodle being a favorite.

This place is great but the economy did not help them over past few years.  And their food remains consistent and excellent.

Go there, support them and get a great meal .

{"text":"We ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed ! 

Coconut soup is too creamy,the flavor is there but its texture is too thick for soup.

Pad thai noodles were mostly vegetables , and it's kinda bland, and there's baby corns. WHY is there baby corns in my pad thai !!?!? Ugh !!! I would make a wild assumption that their cook is not from Thailand because this is not how an authentic pad thai should taste like. 

Curry fried rice was also bland, luckily we have sriracha at home. Again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither.

We will not order from this place again, sorry.
For those of you looking for an authentic or even great taste thai food, this is NOT the place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today while on business.  Place was empty.  Service was above average and food was very good.  Try the beef salad; fresh and very good."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED! Food is actually good so I have to give them credit regarding food. 

Air conditioning was broken tonight so the restaurant was extremely hot. The manager (maybe owner) was using a dinner spoon to pry open the intake vents on the ceiling while we were eating. Very unsanitary to use a kitchen utensil as a tool, but why do that with customers in the restaurant? 

Very slow service with only three tables occupied in the entire place, while the staff seemed miserable. 
We only ordered 2 bowls of soup and 1 beer, so the manager seemed angry that our bill was very small. He asked us multiple times if we wanted rice or a spring roll which we declined. Of course this seemed to make him more annoyed. 

I really do like the food, but I'm sure the lack of service and using a dinner spoon on a dusty ceiling vent will keep me from coming back. 

Heck, they should have apologized for the broken A/C and maybe offered an appetizer on the house to get us to come back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in all of Charlotte! I love this place! It's family owned and all of the dishes are made fresh! It's cozy and unique inside with a service oriented vibe. The family is so friendly and the garlic chicken is the best! Great lunch specials that include a drink, soup and spring roll!! Keep it up! I wish they had more locations!!!! Great job! A+++++"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this spot for lunch and have always enjoyed it. The service is very friendly and attentive. The price is a great value. Today I had the #1 lunch special (coconut milk with red curry and chicken) and it was DELICIOUS. I'm sure I'll return next week and have the same."}
{"text":"Love their pad thai and the wait staff is friendly! They have fantastic lunch specials as well!"}
{"text":"I must say I expected better.  The décor and atmosphere here is a bit outdated.  The man who served us talked really fast but because I'm used to that it doesn't bother me that much.  It took him quite some time to actually come back to take our order.  I want to say around 8 mins.  Once the orders went in the food came out in a decent amount of time.  I had ordered the street noodles with shrimp.  The noodles had a good cook on the pasta but it was nothing too special.  The plate needed a bit more spice to my liking.  I will note I asked for it to be Medium spicy.  I would have ordered Pad Thai since thats my favorite dish but I have ordered from here that same plate in the past and did not like the type of sauce they use.  

The fried spring rolls were ok but I have honestly had better.  It almost tasted like the rolls could have been premade but I guess we will never know unless we see it made first hand.  

We waited almost 20 mins for the check even after asking the lady who started removing the plates after we had finished.  Out of two visits to this location one take out and one dine in, I have to say this place is just ok.  I'd consider it for lunch again one day maybe try some other things out.  

For the scale of the surrounding businesses this place needs a remodel or make over it doesn't look authentic at all.  That's just my two cents."}
{"text":"The staff is very nice and personable. We used to go all the time and they recognize us and ask about family.  Quick service, food is wonderful. I love the house noodle and husband likes pad Thai, their spring rolls and sauce are yummy! Been going for 11 years. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've visited Thailand multiple times and actually spent 6 months of this year in SE Asia. So I have a high standard for noodles. this place has really good pad Thai. I'm also a vegetarian and my sever even asked if I still wanted egg in my noodles. So I think vegans could eat here as well. The lunch special was really reasonably priced and even includes a Thai tea. Will definitely be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Even though I've lived just down the street for 8 years, this was my first time to Bangkok Ocha. The fella had been many moons ago and liked it, so we ventured out on a Wednesday night. 

When we walked in, there was only one other couple in there at 7:30 pm. As we sat down in the booth (of which there are maybe 6, plus 6-8 tables), the fella and I both noted at the same time that there was a really weird smell - I said wet and musty, he said dog. I think it was maybe wet dog. 

Service was really good, and we ordered pretty basic dishes; I got chicken pad thai, and he got chicken something. Mine was fine, but just a little dry, and his was better. For those two entrees and two glasses of wine, it was $35. Not too shabby.

I'd give it another try, but I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Reviewing a take-out order only -- the Mee Krob we ordered was described to have bits of chicken and there was absolutely none. Called back after discovering this and manager said that's how this dish was... everything else was decent, but this appetizer should have been refunded and we will not be going back-"}
{"text":"Well, the decent reviews for this place brought us here, but we weren't impressed. As I'm writing this, I'm teetering between 2 and 3 stars. 

We came in for an early dinner and got pretty quick (albeit rushed, impatient) service, but the food wasn't great. 

I ordered a glass of wine I knew was a dependable label, but it tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge too long after opening. 

Our summer roll appetizer was okay, but the rice paper skin seemed tougher than I'm used to (another indicator of lack of freshness). Filling was pretty good, dipping sauce was standard, with a bit of chili garlic sauce. 

We were craving shrimp, and ordered a shrimp special and a second shrimp item from the menu. We told the server \"medium\" spice. The resulting entrees were bland, and the shrimp, although plentiful, were pretty overcooked and didn't seem fresh (perhaps frozen). The sauces didn't have authentic Thai flavor at all. One tasted faintly of ginger (with no pronounced lemongrass as was indicated in the entree name) and the other was a thin teriyaki-flavored mild (not medium-spicy) weak broth. The strangest choice by the kitchen was to pour our entrees onto beds of sad, yellow iceberg lettuce for service. The entrees and the rice served alongside weren't very hot when served.  My dinner date went in search of condiments to jazz up our boring dinners and was offered some chili garlic sauce and a shaker of what smelled and tasted like an bizarre combo of soy and liquid smoke (?).

Our $50+ bill just made matters worse. If you've got a hankering for Thai, just know that this is not the real deal and the food is just so-so. :("}
{"text":"Our go-to place for take out dinner. Food is excellent, owners are very nice. Happy to support a long time local business and also have a great meal!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 yrs. We love the food and wonderful couple who run the place. Consistently good and spice levels are perfect. Don't miss the Thai Iced Tea, Spinach and Peanut Sauce, & Paad See Ew."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! The food is always really good & the staff is always very nice. I remember when I first went to Bangkok Ocha, I told a gentleman that I wanted Thai Hot: 4 & he said, \"Oh no no!\" & that it would be too hot for me. Luckily, I've progressively been allowed to get my dishes hotter & hotter without them worrying :) I do like how they look out for you though. As for the dishes, they are always delicious. I can literally say there are days that I sit at my desk at work just imagining going to Bangkok Ocha. It is literally THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"This place made me feel like I was visiting my parent's friend and eating in their dining room. It is AMAZING!
Large portions or endless flavors and freshness. They give a lot for such low price! 
I love the environment and super friendly staff. I want to take this place, move it to Brooklyn and have it to myself.
I shall visit again when I am in North Carolina :)"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like is place. We have yet to find a really excellent Thai place in charlotte. We ordered take out of pad Thai, pad see ew, red curry and fish cakes. The pad Thai was the most flavorful thing we had. The fish cakes were pretty greasy. Across the board, the dishes were flavorless. They warned me that the red curry was hot when I ordered it on the phone. Couldn't be further from the truth. The food was well cooked, but lacked seasoning and flavor overall. Nothing tragically wrong with it, just not very tasty. Also a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"5 stars because this is by far the best thai food here in pineville nc. We ordered from make a foodie call and they delivered it to the door. We ordered chicken satay...tender delicious chicken, the tom kah soup was so so good as well we also ordered a chicken and veggie stir fry. All for $40 tip included! Will order again!"}
{"text":"NO.  DON'T.  First experience was awful.  I had to ask for iced tea 3 times before I got it.  This was when we were the only customers in the restaurant.  My boyfriend asked them to leave the tomatoes out of the Tom Kha.  Restaurant owner explained for 3 minutes why this was a bad idea.  My BF had to insist that he orders it this way everywhere and it is never a problem.  Got it the way he ordered it and it was good.  My food was also good.  However, the restaurant owner would not leave us alone and kept coming to our table to discuss food- theirs and why it was so good and why other places are not good.  So not interested.  

However, this place is so close to our home, and we both love Thai food, so we decided to try it again.  This time, for take out.  How bad could it be?  The food was good.  It was the service that was horrible.  Well, as it turns out, it can be unbelievably bad for take-out as well.  I called in my order.  I made the colossal mistake of asking if they have brown rice.  Got a 3 minute lecture on how brown rice tastes bad and jasmine rice is wonderful.  It would have gone on longer if I had not interrupted this soliloquy to ask when the food would be ready.  TWENTY MINUTES.  Well, sure, if you aren't expecting any customers, why would you prep the food in advance?  He tells me that they serve the curries medium hot.  I know my boyfriend doesn't like spicy food, so I asked if they could make his less than medium.  Nope.  Absolutely not. They can only make it hotter, not less hot.  Fine.  Whatever.  Can I just get off this phone call?  We pick up the food.  Again, absolutely no one else in the restaurant and only the owner and his wife working there.  Which is weird since Bahn Thai is 2 miles away and stays packed. The food was good.  My BF's food, was not hot at all but mild, and mine, which was also supposedly medium hot, was at the top of my spicy tolerance range, and I like spicy food.  

Bottom line: NEVER AGAIN.  Getting a lecture with my food is not my idea of a good restaurant experience.  This restaurant does not believe in giving the customer what they want, but in giving them an education on what they SHOULD want.  Save yourself aggravation and just go to Bahn Thai.  They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Soft music and no televisions. A lot of food for the price. Pad thai was kind of bland. Good spring rools and thai iced tea. Attentive staff."}
{"text":"Quick service and good food. The restaurant was quiet and clean and had beautiful decor. The owners were super friendly and helpful. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because it was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"These guys have the best scallops I've tasted in a landlocked area! I don't know how they do it. House Noodles with Scallops is a must try!!"}
{"text":"In town for the week with Bae while he has been here for 6 weeks so far for work. He kept raving about the seafood sweet n sour soup he had at this place last week. Well he woke up today with a man cold. All he wanted was the soup! I love Thai so I was into it. So glad I went along with him. Got the chicken panang and it came  with a cup of House soup , steamed rice and a crispy spring roll.  Bae got the infamous lemongrass soup with seafood and chicken pad thai. All was just delicious. It was quite busy for a late lunch but I can see why. Very fresh tasing soup and the meal was hot and plentiful. I would highly recommend this place. Best panang I have had in a very long time!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! I came by here and did a to go order and the server was very friendly and wanted to make sure my food was correct. I got the pud kee mao with beef and a spring roll. Spring roll was delicious and crispy. The pud kee mao was delicious. Huge portion and cooked perfectly. I 've been here a few times without any issues. I've never had to wait long, I've never had bad service and the food is always good!!"}
{"text":"Eh- I don't want to be rude, and honestly I didn't expect that much from a Thai restaurant in the south... But this place was pretty bad. I came with 80% of my family right before Thanksgiving and it's just blah.

The interior needs a serious make over, not saying it needs to NYC style upgrade but a fresh coat of paint, new rug and lighting alone would probably make a significant difference.

I had the chicken pha thai and it was really dry and the flavor was off. 

I don't want to dump on this place too bad because the family who owns it/works there is very kind.

But this place needs so love for sure."}
{"text":"Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son. 

I met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast. 

And the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! 

The service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"The best Thai place around. I've never eaten in the restaurant, I always get to go and it is always SO GOOD and the portions are very generous. My fiancé gets the pineapple chicken fried rice and I get pud won sew? It's a bean noodle dish and to die for! Mom&pop owned super sweet couple."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Thai food.  Nice large, fresh scallops and shrimp.  Crisp flavorful veggies and fluffy rice. The lunch soup before your meal is delightfully mild and a smooth start to your meal.  The owners and staff really care about your dining experience and want to make sure that you enjoy everything.  We will be back many times."}
{"text":"First time in yesterday, and I will definitely go back. I got the Chicken Pud Thai - medium spice. Next time I will go a little spicier. The chicken was a little over cooked .. otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. The service was fantastic! Always around to refill our water. Prices are reasonable. Wasn't crowded on a Thursday night. Great spot overall!"}
{"text":"The food was Very tasty and authentic.  The staff  was friendly and provided Excellent service.  We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Bangkok Ocha for many, many years.  Although there are fancier Thai restaurants in Charlotte (and beyond), and ones with bigger menus, Bangkok Ocha has THE best wide noodles...always perfectly cooked and seasoned!  When I used to work nearby, I probably went there for lunch on a near weekly basis.  My favorite go-to dish is \"House Noodles\" (with Beef), and if you go for lunch, you'll get this INCREDIBLE dish, along with complimentary soup, spring roll and drink for less than 10 bucks!  Seriously, if you've never tried Thai food, try this dish, and you'll probably be hooked (like I am)!  I will add that I only dined there for dinner just once...so I'm referring to the excellent lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Review update!! Yuck I hate the service at this place.  The lady is nice...the man is super annoying and rude.  The food delivery was extra slow tonight..the man took our order and tried to talk several of us out of our specialized orders...like \"no that's too hot...you know that's hot, right?\" And at one point when I asked for only onions in my noodles even mumbled that I was \"changing the whole recipe\". Yea, so?! I'm paying for it. 

The food review remains the same...but I really do not feel like dealing with that kind of treatment and will most likely never go back.  There's plenty of other places. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"My family has been dining at Bangkok Ocha for years, and with good reason.  First, the staff is friendly, and they make a point of getting to know their customers.  They truly want guests to leave happy.  We always do.  The food is excellent, and the price is right.  I've never traveled to Thailand, so I can't vouch for the true \"authenticity\", but I have dined at a lot of Thai restaurants in the US and Europe, and this is my favorite.  I truly believe you won't find better Thai food in Charlotte.  The owners (Steven and Sunny) have made sure the flavors are perfect, and they aim to please.  I feel fortunate to have this delicious place just down the street.  And as a BONUS,  when I have a head cold, I go in and ask Steven for a curry dish to help clear my head, and he knows what works!  Also, the soups they serve at lunch are delicious.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here for lunch. I would highly recommend it! It's fast, friendly, priced right & very good. I always order the Pad Thai w/ chicken. They offer a spice (heat) range from 1 to 5 (5 being the hottest). I usually go with a 4. At lunch, for $7.95, you get unsweetened tea, soup, & your entree dish. They offer a different soup every day of the week. There is something to be said about friendly service and this place has it! To walk in and be greeted by name is a nice feeling. Because of my job, I once went almost a year without going in, but my first time back, I was greeted by name with a friendly smile, seated, and they even remembered what I used to order. Wow! It can sometimes be pretty busy at lunch time but the wait is never too long. You've got to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This was my first Thai place I've ever visited and u haven't found another place that tastes as good as this place.  They have the best spring rolls and I love their pad see ew.   The noodles that they use is much better than other places because the noodles is thicker. 

The staff is also very friendly.  The only downfall is that they close between 2pm and 5pm.  So this place is not ideal for a late lunch.  Other than that... this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  The decor was outdated and looked drab. The lighting was nonexistent, we were basically eating in the dark. The wait staff was friendly,  but honestly it was hard to understand them because they spoke so,  so fast. The food was not great.  I ordered #23- Gaeng Panang curry. I ordered it with chicken. I was greatly disappointed when it arrived. It was barely spicy,  despite the waiter describing it as \"level 3\". The chicken was rubbery, the vegetables were soggy, and the jasmine rice was mushy. For $12 I was expecting something not quite so gross. The saving graces-nice staff, clean,  not busy at all. The cons-drab decor, not great food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So this will be my last time eating here... first they rush you to order which typically is okay but literally the menu items are not your everyday food and the menu changes everyday and they really don't give you much help when asking what is what I was initially able to look past that the first time... and my first time eating here it was very tasty...
then I came today for lunch... I asked for my meal vegetarian style to include tofu and I was informed all the soups and the spring roll that come with lunch have meat in them (great that tofu soup I had the other day was probably chicken based smh) I simply asked if I could substitute those two items for steamed rice (which to be honest seems more than fair) when I asked she said \"no substitutions I can bring out the soup and the spring roll just don't eat them but no substitutions\" 

Her downright rudeness about being unaccommodating was so ridiculous I almost left... but instead I decided to stay and write this review as I wait for my food. I just took a bite and I.T tastes okay but overall the customer service element is really lacking which is so disappointing as the food is good I guess that's why so many people put up with the poor customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place. They cook their veggies perfectly!!! As a lover of broccoli, this is highly important to me.  Most places overcook them so I'm always happy when I come here.

My favorite dish is the Pud Khana. I get scallops. It also comes with broccoli, carrots, baby corn, mushrooms and jasmine rice. The sauce is light and slightly sweet. They use Sea scallops so you get the big ones! After you eat this dish, you feel healthy and satisfied. 

If you order chicken be aware it comes fried and battered by default. This makes the meal not as healthily and light feeling."}
{"text":"Very good food.The poor man seemed to be alone serving the whole restaurant but we still did not have to wait to long. The good was good and we woudl go back. I had the Pad Thai and spring rolls. Very yummy"}
{"text":"Was told by the owner they don't take shortcuts on their food.  And it shows.  I've been several times trying something new every time I visit. And they have never let me down.  The food has so much flavor and is just the right amount of spice.  I always get an extra spring roll because it's delicious.  The restaurant is small and private but a bit dark. Which is nice for a quiet meal.  Lunch portions are a good size."}
{"text":"This is probably a better place for lunch than dinner.  The lunch menu is reasonably priced and has eight traditional Thai dishes a day, each served with rice, soup, a spring roll and iced tea.  The service is quick and the food is flavorful (except for the soup- that was a little bland)."}
{"text":"I've been in the process of revisiting some of the area Thai places and decided to give this one another shot.  

The outside of the restaurant is receiving a makeover along with the rest of the shopping center.  Gone is the covered walkway right in front of the restaurant and the brick facade.  It's now a white facade with shade awnings above the windows.  

It seemed to be better this time around than my original visit but there were still some flaws.  The soup that came with lunch was kind of bland.  It was like an egg drop soup with corn and all you tasted was the corn.

My lunch was a chicken dish with bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and of course rice.  The chicken was overcooked.  The veggies were good though and the spice level (5) was spot on.

The staff was friendly here and everything came out super quick and although I increased my rating for them by a star, I don't think it's enough to make me want to come back again.  There are better lunch Thai options for me."}
{"text":"The owner is fantastic, the food is always top notch and their lunch special is the best around.  It doesn't hurt that the Pad Thai is literally the best i've ever had.  Their \"Hot\" is perfect...you get the heat without any nasty aftertaste or anything that messes up your enjoyment.  I'm always a bit disappointed that the pad thai is so good that i never order anything else....so the wife is always slapping my hand when i try stealing bits of hers"}
