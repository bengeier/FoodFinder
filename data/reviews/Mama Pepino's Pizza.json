{"text":"Awful customer service.  Gave us the wrong order,  over priced for the quality. When called back to voice my concerns was placed on hold for 15 minutes.  Can't wait until Abruzzi's starts delivering."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We make it a point to travel about 20 miles to have our favorite pizza.  Sometimes there is a little wait, but it's always because they are very busy."}
{"text":"Terrible management and ownership!  We ordered delivery, they brought the wrong sandwich and their suggestion \"how about a refund or a credit\".  Seriously biggest joke of my life...how about the right sandwich?  Guess I just won't eat tonight."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza!! Being from New York, and being a bit of a pizza fanatic. I know good pizza!! The sub's (or \"hoagies\") are excellent too. Nice fresh baked bread. And oversized...  Since I've found this place I eat there at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. I order at least once a week. The cheese is delicious. They also have great Monday and Tuesday specials. Example: large 1 topping pizza $9.50"}
{"text":"This pizza is some of the best in NHT. It is take out only but amazing. The only thing I don't like about them is their price of wings. $20 for a dozen, they need to find a new supplier."}
{"text":"The food is good, but their staff has the worst attitude ever. It doesn't matter what time you call (and I have called many times and gotten many people), they always act like you're ruining their day. Positively rude. If there were other delivery options around (even not pizza), they would lose my business easily."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in the Elizabeth area. The bread sticks are our favorite too."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST pizza and bread-sticks in the North Huntingdon/Irwin area.   They always have good combo deals, too.   Better to order out rather than eat in cause it can get really hot due to the pizza ovens."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Mama Pepino's, Irwin for over 7 months. There are 2 BIG pizza places to order from. Neither are which Mama Pepino's!!!. Every time I've ordered, I was given a time they would arrive. The last 2 times I was given a 45 minute time line. After about 75 minutes I called asking where my order was. I was told both times the driver was on his way. The 1st yiythis happened, the driver told me that he was standing there when they told me he was on \"his way\". He said this happens all the time. The 2nd time (tonight) same story only this time the manager told me it was coming and was free. This time he hung up on me. I never asked or requested a \"free\" pizza. I think I was more than patient waiting both times for my order, only this time I was hung up on as if I was being unreasonable. This pizza was NOTHING like the pizza I fell in love with. The rudeness of the \"manager\" and the quality of this pizza was inexcusable. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but this is by far the most disorganized operation I have ever dealt with.  Constantly the orders are incorrect, the delivery is very very slow. When taking an order they will normally put you on hold for 5-10 minutes.   When it comes to pizza there are so many other choices.... I would suggest you try one other than this one."}
{"text":"Why the bad reviews???  I came in for lunch today and grabbed a menu.  Laid back atmosphere.  Guy said we have some lunch specials if your interested.  I ended up not going with the specials even tho they had some good deals.  I got the perogi pizza.  I couldn't resist not trying it.  It was one of most interesting and favorite pizzas I ever had.  I love trying new things, this was new.  There has been thought put behind the menu and details of what they do..  I'll be back.  And will recommend."}
{"text":"I've had food from this place on four separate occasions, and it has not let me down yet. Their hoagies are toasted crisp and delicious.  The prices are pretty reasonable an the portion sizes are ample. It's one of the biggest menus I have ever seen for a takeout place and I will keep going back. NHT doesn't have a huge amount of restaurants, so this place should do fairly well if they keep delivering a quality product.  In my opinion, a sign of a good establishment is when it is fully staffed. When you walk in the doors of this place, there are workers everywhere. They seem to work together as a team very well and are highly efficient. It is clearly evident in the quality of their food and service. Well done."}
{"text":"Food is good, we have had their pizza, breadsticks and wings. Tonight when I called to order food I was placed on hold and no one ever answered after 5 minutes. The last time I ordered I was quoted a waiting time of an hour which is fine but after an hour past still no food, when I called to check on my order I was told my food needed remade and it would be there in 15 minutes. After all said and done it took over 1 1/2 hrs. The owner obviously needs to hire more help cuz no matter when I call they are so busy. I will take my business elsewhere for now."}
{"text":"Had their pizza yesterday. And I'm excited that I get to have it for breakfast today! My co-worker & I are picky about our pizza pies, so had to toss up a review."}
{"text":"Once again - same complaint.  Pizza is amazing, but dear lord please figure out how long it actually takes to make a pizza.  Every time it's the same - will be ready in 30 minutes, and then it's a half hour late.  EVERY TIME. No \"sorry\" - no discount, they don't care at all. Worst service in the industry and there is a lot of competition.  Likely our last order today!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and a steak sub and was told it would be 25 minutes. I got there after about 35 minutes and was told something happened and my pizza never got made. The cashier told me they did have another pizza made that they could put in the oven and have for me in a few minutes. I waited another 15 or so and they have me the pizza which of course was burnt. I mean what do u think is going to happen when u put an already cooked pizza back in the oven? I was offered nothing for my wasted time. I gave the pizza back and asked for my money back. They could have at least given me the sub for free but that wasn't happening."}
{"text":"Such an improvement since the new ownership, management, staff and oven. This pizza shop used to be a downer, but the experience has improved so dramatically I felt the need to write a five star review. Hope the staff embraces the change. Hope the new owner keeps going in this positive direction."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! We order it almost every night after work, and pick up the pizza! We usually buy a sausage and onion pizza, and we have not been disappointed once with our order. The prices are reasonable for the sizes of the pizzas, and the timing it takes to cook the pizza is reasonable. We do not dine inside, but they have 2 booths and a couple of tables inside. They have some of the best pizza in the Irwin area!"}
{"text":"The best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had- hands down. Their other pizzas, wings, and wraps are also good. Prices reasonable.  Biggest (and, really only) complaint - wait time. Don't think going to pick up your food is any quicker. I've chosen to pick up instead of delivery, and it's a mistake. They'll tell you 45 minutes, but it's more like an hour and fifteen."}
{"text":"Called them 5 times said they were open till ten no answer give my business to someone else"}
{"text":"I order it well done so it comes cooked. I order half cheese bc it is way too much. I dont know how they control their costs. Always inconsistent. But its better then etown pizza for sure. We tried another place was even worse. Brings us back to its the best this town has got, pizza-effically. The pie was excellent at the firemens festival this year, i gather because the owners were present. I have had the wings and are pretty good. So take it with a grain of salt. This place could have great pie and food but i think may a have staff issues. I hope for the best when i order. I wont call at peak times bc quality will be thrown out the oven door to push all the half assed foods."}
{"text":"Called to place an order and waited 10 minutes on hold. I hung up and called back and the young \"lady\" answered and shrieked \"I'm not taking your order we're too busy!\" She slammed the phone down and lost this business my business and everyone I can relay this story too as well. Idiots."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the bad reviews are all about I stopped in today for lunch and ordered a 9 inch Italian hoagie. The service was fast even being as busy as they were I only waited 10 minutes for my food and it was delicious. Within the 10 minutes that I was there they put out a lot of pizza so that tells you something about how good that place is."}
