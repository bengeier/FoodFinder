{"text":"I went here for lunch a week ago. I was hungry, having played basketball for 2 hours earlier that day. The menu was expansive, and a lot of the options looked great. I did the unofficial tasting menu, ordering falafel a la carte, a bowl of the gazpacho, half a chicken salad sandwich, and a house salad.   The gazpacho came out first. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was spicy, and unlike most other restaurant gazpachos I've tried, it had big, quarter-sized chunks of vegetables in it. One of the best gazpachos I've ever had.   The chicken salad sandwich was also very good. It was hearty, not too mayonnaise-y, and really well and interestingly seasoned (basil and honey, I think?). The house salad and falafel were solid but unspectacular.   Great place overall. Good value (large portion of salad and good-sized half sandwich was 9 or 10 bucks), tons of healthy options/vegan choices for the herbivores. Somewhat out of my way in Solon, but well worth the trip on a slow weekend afternoon.   I chatted with one of the owners for a while.  She was very friendly and had a lot of helpful tips and info about the menu.  She and her husband are restaurant-industry veterans, and apparently used to have a place on case western's campus. I highly recommend you check this place out for lunch or a light dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered a vego matic and it was great. Good portion size and fresh. The owner was patient with our questions and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of fresh, healthy food!  Vegan and meat selections make it available to everyone and the employees truly care about service and quality."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite lunch spots in the area. Everything is very fresh and made to order. Their soup of the day is always worth ordering. The owners take pride in what they serve and it shows. The sandwiches are really good and the salads are fresh. There isn't one thing on the menu I wouldn't recommend. Eat in, take out and they cater!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The vegan chili and falafel didn't disappoint. The owners were friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I usually really like this place, but today my experience was quite different. In my falafel sandwich, which was dryer and blander than usual, was a broken toothpick that stabbed me in the throat. I did not see it, because it wasn't stuck into the sandwich with the colored tip like it usually is. It was literally inside the sandwich. When I told the staff, they apologized and told me that I probably just missed it, but I am sure that I looked at the sandwich before eating. I was upset about their response.   Overall, this place has good vibes and normally superb customer service, but today was a pretty terrible experience."}
{"text":"I love Munch! The owners are so friendly and sweet and made the experience nice and the food was absolutely amazing. It's nice to have a vegetarian/vegan friendly place in Solon. I got Julie's tabbouleh wrap and it was delicious! Definitely coming back here more often."}
{"text":"I happened upon munch one day while running errands. I always like to check out new places so I looked at the menu, and yelp of course! This place deserves more than 5 stars. Food was fantastic, the staff is friendly and very helpful. I will definitely be including this place in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Stopped by here with my wife and son shortly after they opened.  Scott greeted us, explained the specials to us, gave us some samples,  and then we ordered.  My son had chili and I had mushroom soup.   Both were excellent on a cold day.  My wife had falafel, and while I wouldn't say it was as good as my soup, it was still very good.  We were happy to see a several healthy options on the menu and look forward to trying more of them on return visits.  The location can be a little hard to find as they don't front Miles Road, but rather, are on the side of the shopping center adjacent to Miles Farmer's Market.  If you see Honey Hut, you're in the right place.    Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Healthy and pure ingredients.The owner is very nice and ensures that you get the best out of your order.He provides great suggestions while ordering, making your food more awesome!!!!. Lots of vegetarian options. We had banana peanut butter and spinach smoothie. Yum yum!!! The falafel wraps are great. Sweet onion soup was so flavorful. Large portions yet u will not want to stop!!! I am going to suggest Munch to all my friends.  Great eatery in Solon. Keep up the yummy and healthy food."}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars if for no other reason than the great guest experience I was provided while getting my takeout. I was a first time visitor and was given samples of their chili, egg salad, chicken salad and tuna salad (all were awesome). I ordered the chicken salad melt before I had a chance to sample, so now I know what I want next time! Great customer service and my melt is delicious. Excited to try it again. Great local place! Oh forgot to add, pickles taste fresh!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I never knew it existed. But i recently became a vegan and i looked on yelp for vegan restaurants by where i work and this place popped up. I ordered the Red Sea wrap which is hummus, red pepper, and some other veggies in a tomato wrap.  It was huge and delicious and i was sad when i ate it all because i wanted more! Cute plate, great owners/workers. Adorable. I wish i knew about it sooner. Thank you for existing for us vegans!!!! And very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. My wife had the Red Sea and I had the falafel - both excellent - I agree with other reviewers , unless you are familiar with the strip mall it might be a little challenging to find. However, it's worth seeking out. High quality clean food, good variety and unique . Not exclusively vegetarian nor gluten free but both available. Will return , without a doubt- welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A fantastic concept and fresh take on sandwiches plus the flexibility to order it the way you want it.  The feature of the menu are their pita sandwiches (although you can change it to regular bread or a wrap or even a salad (I think)).    The owners have put together a lot of cool, out of the box creations including several Lebanese/Mediterranean, vegetarian or meatetarian options.  Best part, though, is the ability to customize everything.     My favorite is anything that includes their in-house roasted turkey.  Their soups are also fresh made daily and o so delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had Julie's Max Falafel with a home brewed ice tea.   Very good and a healthy option for lunch.  I loke that it was a unique family owned place.  Very nice folks that own the place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Everything is homemade and fresh, and they go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. Hands down the best service I have ever come across. Defiantly try the soups, they are homemade and excellent! We tried the black bean and the gazpacho, which were both outstanding."}
{"text":"Decent food, however, the Website prices are outdated and need updated.  Everything in this place is $1-$2 dollars more than the website.  I've told them for months and they still haven't updated the website."}
{"text":"Just had a phenomenal lunch here. Great local place with very friendly owners. Food was fresh, healthy , and delicious. Hidden gem in strip on Miles road near Miles market, but worth searching out. Eat here now!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best, \"vegan\" places in the region. My wife and I drove from Pennsylvania, and it was worth the day trip. The \"Big A\" was amazing, and the bean sprouts add a unique touch. Highly recommend this place for a nice place to get a healthy meal and talk with the good folks who run the place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners. Nice to have more clean, simple and healthy food options!! The classic falafel sandwich was delicious and so was the vegan chili. Check em out!"}
{"text":"Munch is a tasty and healthy choice. It is always clean and the food is fresh. They have been doing authentic Mediterranean food for a long time. I love the people who work there, too.  They are really nice and is seems to be a family business that they enjoy running. It's located in the back of the strip center off Miles Road near the Brainard intersection, next to Miles Market.  Definitely worth finding."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for something different. It was and more. The people at the restaurant were very friendly and explained the  menu thoroughly and helped us choose a melt and a falafel, a delicious brownie and top grade coffee. We'll be back. SOON"}
{"text":"Today was the first time visiting munch and it will definitely not be my last. I had the Marv's club and it was soooo good and fresh. The bacon was so crispy, thick and delicious. I added sprouts to mine to give it a extra yum factor. I haven't made up my my mind on what to get next. Everything looks so good but I think I have to give Marv's club one more try. Lol"}
{"text":"Wow amazing. I would give Munch 6 stars if I could. Tried Julie's Tabbouleh and it was so so delicious and flavorful. Great place for vegans AND non vegans. I'm definitely going to come here more often."}
{"text":"Really cute flexetarian sandwich shop we discovered on our trip to the Cleve. Owners are super friendly, and food is great... They DO have meat products, in case the word \"vegan\" offends your omnivorous palate, but they have a wonderful vegetarian selection as well. They brought out my 2 year old's food first, knowing the gnat-like attention span toddlers have. All our food was delish. I got the egg salad sammie, my husband got a The Hobb (which is a falafel pita filled with yummy veggies) and soup, and the kid's menu is basically a mini version of many of the adult items... which is great. We'd definitely come back when visiting Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Stopped at Munch for lunch with the wife.   The place is right next to the Miles Farmers Market.   Nice decor and very friendly people working there.  The lady asked us if it was our first to me there and we explained that indeed it was.   She went over the menu with us and asked if we had any questions, like I said very friendly people.  My wife and I both got the Big A which was absolutely freaking delicious.    We also got some pita chips to go with it.   The food was fresh and very tasty.   They have MANY vegetarian and Vegan options available.  I highly recommend stopping in and giving them a try, I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Julie's Tabbouleh is an awesome home made Meal! Also had the black bean chilli which was great and my 12 year old even loved it! Great service and a very kind staff."}
{"text":"Good sh*t. Came here to bring my vegan fiancée and I ended up liking it myself. I just added pastrami to my falafel"}
{"text":"Stopped by Much on a roadtrip, looking for a quick bite, not too far off the freeway, where I could get a vegan option.  Wife loved the hummus and tahini pita sandwich.  I enjoyed the vegan chili.  Kids liked their food (quesadilla and a chicken salad sandwich).  Service was awesome.  The guy behind the counter cares and ti shows.    If I lived closer, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy vegetarian, vegan and omnivore options.  Cool artwork by local artists add to the fun atmosphere.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was around the around looking for a good and healthy place to eat and came across this on Yelp. I was so surprised that it had 5 stars and so many reviews I had to check it out. Let me tell you- every star is well deserved!! Amazing place and food was delicious. Owner and workers were so nice it was!"}
{"text":"Discovered Munch this week. Looking for a healthy dinner. Found it here. Owner was very accommodating and very friendly. He offered a taste of anything we wanted before we ordered. We got 2 cups of soup; a gazpacho and onion. Both really delish. Came with side of homemade pita chips. We also got the turkey sandwich and tuna. And both were very good and filling. They roast the turkey's in house. So it's not just lunch meat.   We would definitely go back. Great experience friendly service and delicious homemade food. Plus, I love to go to the little mom and pop places to support the local small business. This fits that and has great food. Sold!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. Great value. Will definitely be back there for more. The owner Scott is a real gem. Great to have a great local restaurant to support."}
{"text":"Oh my golly gee wiz! I only wish there was one of these in Denver! Vegan black bean soup has a nice kick the Julie's Tabouleh is an amazing sandwich! Everything is fresh, made to order & the service is outstanding"}
{"text":"Munch is amazing!! Always has healthy fresh food and great service with a smile.  Well priced and each wrap or falafel is super filling.  Great lunch place and would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"I've gone vegetarian. This place looked great and felt great. The sandwich was huge & good but on the dry side so I asked for dressing. The self serve infused water was good & the self serve made me feel at home. I had a few great conversations too."}
{"text":"Went there with my sisters and mom and it was absolutely delicious. They have options there for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores. I tried multiple things there and I have never been disappointed. I definitely recommend you try this place. It's really unique and definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"So, my wife, mother-in-law, and I came here to eat because we were staying at a hotel a few minutes down the road...and boy are we glad we made the 10 min drive here. From start to finish, everything was phenomenal. We came in, and the place has a pretty whimsical, artsy feel with bright colors, vibrant menu, and paintings along the walls. The owner was there and was kind enough to explain the menu and point out various items that were either vegetarian, vegan, or carnivorous. My wife got the falafel salad, which had falafel (of course), hummus, tabouli, cucumber, lettuce, and tomatoes. My MIL got a cheese quesadilla off the kids menu (although it took some convincing because she isn't under 12). And I got the classic falafel with hummus, which was mashed falafel, tomatoes, tahini, sprouts, and hummus on a pita. All of the food came very quickly, and tasted great! I thought it was a little on the pricey side, but considering we got three entrees (one was a kids meal though), two milk shakes, and a peanut butter cookie, it was ~$41. And, the entrees were all pretty large, so big in fact that none of us finished ours and all took part of it to-go. My MIL also got a blueberry, strawberry, and banana shake, which she liked a lot. I got a peanut butter and banana shake, and it really hit the spot. We wish there were more places like this that offer tons of vegetarian, and vegan options while also having the occasional meat so typical consumers aren't so \"put off\" by the place."}
{"text":"I originally went to accommodate others in my group who are vegan.  I will admit I was not looking forward to eating vegetarian tonight.  Very happily surprised.  The falafel with mushrooms wrap was very flavorful and the veggies were very crisp.  I think the secret ingredient in their food is \"love\".  The food felt very personal in a very good way.    The menu is \"flexitarian\".   Many options from fully vegan to meat.  They only use \"whole\" foods so no processed foods.  Relaxed atmosphere.  Will certainly come back."}
{"text":"Super friendly owners, clean and great menu options for the veggies and meat eaters. The 16 year old said her turkey melt was the best sandwich she'd ever had. Husband also said the turkey melt was great. I had a veggie wrap and was not disappointed. Wish they were closer to home!"}
{"text":"A Yelp find that was amazing. It was worth the 40 minute drive for only a sandwich. Jennifer and I got a appetizer that was good with the humus and  traditional bread. It wasn't overly crunchy or dry like it usually is as restaurants   I got a pastrami sandwich with stadium mustard and a tasty Jewish rye. It to me was better than corky and Lenny's which was good but didn't have the same type of flavor.   She got a portabella sandwich wrap that was delicious. All of the ingredients were fresh and high quality. And the owners were amazing and nice and started conversations w us and kept track to ensure we were happy. We even had a conversation w the table next to us.   The ice tea was also fresh and the lemon was a nice touch. This place was amazing."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  Friendly, helpful staff. Delicious food. I had the Julie taboulie falafel. It was fresh and yummy. Flavor upon flavor. House made pickle on the side was a perfect addition. Coconut curry soup was also very good with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone! Great selection of vegan and vegetarian foods along with healthy dining. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Consistently great, fresh, healthy food. Great service. My favorites are the Red Sea wrap and the falafel. One of my favorite lunch spots on the east side."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great owners, always very friendly. Never had a bad meal here.   Great catering options as well."}
{"text":"The owner is super friendly and let us choose our own ingredients for our smoothies! Very fresh tasting food!"}
{"text":"The homemade soups are excellent!  I have had the minestrone, the matzah ball, chic noodle and last night gazpacho to ring in summer!  Okay it is not here yet but I am sooo... ready. I saw the tabouleh and it looked awesome. Next time!!"}
{"text":"Came for the rumored vegetarian options. Stayed for the actualized and plentiful vegetarian options. My Papa's Portobello melt was delicious both immediately from the restaurant and later as leftovers.  The owners were incredibly friendly, the local artwork was gorgeous, and the food was great. I'm not Cleveland based but would absolutely return if I were. Highly recommend, especially if you're looking for sprouts."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place in all of Cleveland. I live out of town but this is one of my first stops whenever I come to visit. Always fresh, everyone is nice, the place is clean, and the food is AMAZING. Couldn't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has been on my short list of places to try for some time. My daughter and I finally had the opportunity to try Munch, last Friday evening and we were not at all disappointed.   We visited at approx 6:30, and there were a few other patrons in the restaurant.  We were immediately greeted by the owner, and she could not have been more welcoming.  She explained the menu and offered us a sample of the curried lentil soup and OMG, it was SO good.  My daughter doesn't like lentils, but really liked the soup.  It was rich and full of flavor.  We proceeded to place our order.  We both ordered the turkey club, my daughter ordered hers with turkey bacon, I ordered mine's with pork bacon.  We also ordered a side of tabouli.  We seated ourselves, and our tabouli and pita chips arrived a short time later.  The tabouli was fresh and tasty, not as juicy as traditional lebanese tabouli, but very good, never the less.  Our sandwiches arrived and every element was spot on.  Thick cut multi-grain bread, juicy turkey breast, meaty tomatoes, fresh lettuce and a delicious herb mayo, along with the think cut bacon.  The sandwich was SO tasty!   We will absolutely return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Love this place! Wonderful healthy, reasonably priced food to go or to stay! Super friendly staff, clean and comfortable to sit and enjoy! Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian and vegan options!! Staff was super friendly and portions were really big."}
{"text":"Great spot! Open, colorful, fresh atmosphere and food to match.  My favorite so far ia the Julie's tabouleh, it was delicious and not overly filling. Can tell that care is put into the menu and the execution.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"SO delish! Super friendly staff, very clean, and probably the best falafel I've ever had. PERFECT stop right off the highway with fantastic, healthy vegan options. You won't regret dining here - awesome pickles too :)"}
{"text":"No lengthy write up/review is necessary.  This is very, very simple.  You need to get to Munch as soon as you possibly can.  The food is super fresh and the owners are warm and welcoming.  You'll love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I tried their \"My wife's Tuna\" melt and I ate the whole thing in 10 min... There was sweetness to the tuna and it even came with a slice of pickle on side. I finally found my new favorite lunch spot around the area.  The sandwiches are made-to-order and they make different soups each day."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never disappointed. Friendly service, owner is usually working and will explain menu items. Try the soups. Great for vegetarian options. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place besides that it is PHENOMENAL. The food is fresh ingredients that are chosen with care (some every morning), put together wonderfully in suggested menu items, and served by people who are friendly and excited to tell you about their products and see what you think about them.    It is a large menu and many items can be made in different forms - pizza, lettuce wrap, sandwich, wrap, etc. Many vegan items available but don't let that scare you away, they have MEAT and my goodness the bacon & turkey is heaven. The Marvs club with bacon on 9 grain bread I literally dream about (and have already been back for) The herb mayo on there is to die for! The curry lentil soup and the cold gazpacho are some of the best soups I've ever had. I was like $6 for a smoothie, yikes...but when she served it to me it was an insane amount. She gave me the glass and the left overs from the blender. So thoughtful.  Bottom Line: This is a place you become a regular at-and bring your friends and family because you're SO excited to share it with people. This is food and service you feel good about. I will keep going back and trying new things!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am so happy I discovered Munch on Yelp! My mom and I do a day-long trip to the eastern suburbs of Cleveland every summer for some shopping. We were looking for a new lunch spot for when we arrived in town after the 2+ hr drive. As soon as I saw the menu, I knew this was the place.  I think we were the first customers of the day and the owner and his family was so friendly. He asked if we had been there before and how we found out about them. To our surprise, one of his favorite meals is a fish fry from a well known family restaurant in our hometown in Western NY. His wife emphasized that he talked about it all the time. Who would have thought? haha.   He walked us through the menu, mentioning how they source locally and the \"flexitarian\" nature of it. They offered samples of anything we wanted to try and it was hard to make a choice because everything sounded so good.  My mom is a vegetarian, while I will eat anything, and there was so much for both of us to choose from!   Mom started off with a cup (which is actually served in a large coffee mug, so much more than a traditional cup size) of the Portabella bisque which was the soup of the day. I got to try it and it was super tasty, not salty, and a great summer choice. It was also served with a large amount of fresh baked pita chips.  My mom loves falafel, so having 5 different items with them was right up her alley. After careful consideration, she went with the Julie's Tabbouleh falafel. Wheat pita, sprouts, fresh ripe tomatoes, and hummus. It was packed full and my mom couldn't put it down.   I went with the Moe's Home roasted Turkey Breast as a sandwich on 9 grain bread. I liked how anything could be done as a traditional sandwich, a melt, or a wrap. Made for a lot of great choices. The combo of the herbed mayo and the fresh off the bone turkey breast was so delicious, fresh, and makes you never want to eat traditional deli meat ever again. It was also piled with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. The bread wasn't an afterthought either, and it was soft and flavorful. I also got some fresh brewed iced tea and a bag a chips for a combo.  For a total of $21, I think you would be hard-pressed to get such a high quality, flavor packed, filling and large portioned lunch for 2 people. I know we will be back on our further adventures in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"BLT was great. Very reasonably priced and quick service for lunch time rush."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, yes, but I don't really see what's so special. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing. I may have to go back to try something else. I did enjoy the soup special, which was mushroom. I only wish the portion were bigger for the price"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious falafel sandwich! Cute little place tucked back in a strip mall. Totally worth the trip. Also phenomenal onion soup that he gave us a sample of! So glad we went"}
{"text":"I've ordered Munch through Uber Eats. They have really tasty soups and the falafel is also really delicious! Lots of choices for vegetarians, vegans and meat eaters!"}
{"text":"The food was really good here. Loved the hobb falafel and the service was great. It was clear the owners really cared about the food they made and making it an enjoyable experience. I would define recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a quick and healthy option."}
{"text":"I was excited to stumble upon this place when I was on this side of town.  Great lunch spot for people looking for healthy options. I had a sandwich with yummy hummus, veggies and melted cheese.  We also had a side of the hummus and pita chips, which was much larger than expected. Staff were very friendly and it was also a kid friendly place.  I also enjoyed the beautiful artwork on the walls.  Bonus: there's a Honey Hut in the plaza as well.  Will definitely go back the next time I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a vegan lunch. With a couple tweaks this place could be awesome. I got the big a falafel. I was unimpressed. It had raw white mushrooms and green peppers. I'm all about mushrooms but even I know you have to saute those bad boys to get a good complimentary texture in a falafel. Otherwise you get a big bite of raw mushroom surprise. Cook them and chop them into smaller pieces and then we'll have ourselves a pita! I suggest the falafel themselves go back to the drawing board. Find some good hole in the wall places and compare the crunchy delight that they serve up and try to emulate it. My pita also had an obnoxious amount of tahini. All in all it was a bland, messy experience with overpowering mushroom bites thrown in. My girlfriend got the sandwich with cooked portobellos and uncooked green peppers. To make it vegan she requested it without mayo. This sandwich cried out for more flavor so we got some mustard from the staff. The best part of our meal was her rye bread that sandwich came on. The pickles they served were hit and miss. Mine hit. Her's seemed on its way out and had no crunch left in it and was possibly very old.   TL;DR - Falafel needs work. Mushrooms and peppers should always be cooked. Easy on the tahini. Throw some mustard on the side to cure blandness."}
{"text":"Incredible! I'm so impressed with the food and service!! I had the Papa's Portobello and was thrilled! I wish they had a place closer to where I live on the west side! So good!!"}
{"text":"Great big club sandwich was filing and I hade a very good muffin as well. My coworker said Tiboillie wrap was good too.   I think the place has great vegetarian options.  I ordered from them for delivery with über eats and the food came on time within about the 45 minutes listed."}
{"text":"Went here based on the high reviews and loved it!  Great atmosphere, prices, and quality. Wish I lived close to come more frequently! The free water is amazing"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!!  Fresh, healthy and delicious meals. The owners are SO friendly. Since we discovered this gem, my family has eaten there 10 times. Always great. We will forever be regulars."}
{"text":"Munch is easy to miss, tucked back in a commercial strip near Miles Market in the corner of Solon.  Munch has made the space feel warm cozy and very welcoming.  The menu has a nice variety of Mediterranean foods and American classics.  Got to sample a very nice variety at the Yelp event and everything was very good.  The food is wholesome and flavorful served in nice portions especially for the price.  We sampled 2 soups, the gazpacho and the lentil curry; the gazpacho was a zippy tomato soup with crisp vegetables, the lentil was nice and smooth with a nice curry accent.  I had the Portobello melt, a large sandwich with the meaty mushrooms and a great spiced mayo.  I also appreciate the crisp new dill pickle spear.  The falafel and humus were very good.    Munch is easy to miss since it is not visible from Miles road, but it is worth seeking out if you want some good food at a reasonable price.  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food and staff.  Plenty of options on the menu.  Stopped in after work and will stop in again.  Picked up their menu for catering too.  See you soon."}
{"text":"Very cool little sandwich place. Options are veggie friendly, but there are meats too. Soups are good too. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Excellent food quality, amazing tastes, great prices, and friendly staff. My wife and I stopped in on a whim for dinner and we will definitely be coming back! \"Flexitarian\" cuisine (vegetarian, vegan, as well as some meat choices)  it."}
{"text":"A nice little spot that I guess you would call \"fast casual\". The hummus was delicious. The owner offered a free sample of gazpacho (which I've never had) & I loved it. They also offered a free sample of falafel (which I've never had) & I hated it. Still, it was nice to know that before having to fork over cash & be stuck with it.  I ordered 1/2 pastrami sandwich & a cup of the gazpacho. It was very refreshing/filling & if I lived closer it would for sure be a \"go to\" spot.   However, it is 45 minutes from my house, but I'll be sure to remember it when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was driving from Virginia to Michigan and decided to swing in for some food. The menu is well thought out and you can tell the owner cares about his customers. He provides a great atmosphere, experience and of course the food is incredible. He will make anything you ask even if it's not on the menu. The detail and care that went into my meal was much appreciated. If I could articulate my thoughts better I would. I hope you enjoy it as much as me. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I like the fact that they have healthy alternatives and they are close to where I live, however the food was kinda bland and very messy."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick bite to-go or to meet with friends. I love the decor and the owners seem to really care about serving quality food. I would have given it a 5 star but I've been here several times and the owners do not greet you when you walk in it's very odd. Just a simple \"hi welcome to Munch\" would do"}
{"text":"I split a Julie's Tablouleh and a Chicken Salad Melt with my brother and OMG it was amazing. Definitely liked the chicken melt better, the fresh peppers were such a nice fresh bite to the savory chicken. The tabouleh was amazing though, would've liked more tabouleh and less falafel, but that's just me. My brother got an iced coffee black, and it was less than stellar, but would've been good with some cream and sugar."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood. I had the best falafel I've had in Cleveland. I will be a regular at Munch and recommend it to all of my friends. Especially my health conscious friends who love fresh food. The restaurant is very clean, cute and welcoming."}
{"text":"I hate when places fill up your sandwich with sprouts. It's disgusting and they are literally just there as a filler for them. I got the tebuleh falafel. The falafel itself was delicious but I didn't taste any tebuleh and they barely put any hummus or tahini on the wrap. Also like I said it was mostly sprouts. On top of it you don't get the option to pick what kind of pita you want and there multi grain whatever it was tasted stale and has a gross flavor. I wouldn't come back because for almost 9 dollars a sandwich you aren't getting an amazing lunch. I can see vegetarians and vegans coming here because of lack of options and thinking it's a healthy alternative. I went to their website and saw no nutrition info. Just putting that out there."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything is so good and the owners are so friendly and helpful when answering any questions! I got a falafel sandwich. The falafel is soft and moist, definitely a must visit for Cleveland area vegans and vegetarians. I don't know too many places where you can get a good vegan chili and a guaranteed vegetarian soup, either. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I sometimes so wish I had the ability to upgrade from 5 stars to 6 stars.  Anyone who knows me on Yelp knows Munch is one of my favorite places. You honestly cannot beat the great atmosphere, wonderful and healthy food, huge menu, and reasonable prices. Everything is made with real ingredients, and at Munch, I have no problem eating my colors. Everything is so fresh-- no wilted lettuce here. I come here every time i'm in the area, and while I tend to stick with my favorites, i've never had anything I didn't like. They roast their turkey in-house, the salads are bigger than your face, and they'll work with any type of dietary restriction. The walls are also adorned with local art (loveee).  I think we are so lucky to have Munch in Solon. The owners, Scott & Jamie, are two of the nicest people/business owners i've ever met! When my dog was in the car today, I called ahead to place my order so I could run in and get it without leaving him too long. Jamie, the co-owner, offered to run it out to my car! It was so sweet. Romeo would be okay for a bit, so I went in to pick up my usual chicken salad sandwich melt (but not a greasy melt, super delicious) and strawberry smoothie. It was all ready to go in a blink, and Jamie even gave me a little piece of meat for my Romeo! He's currently collapsed on the floor snoring, so it must've been pretty good. I thought this was so sweet.   Skip the chains and support local-- at Munch, you're basically part of the family! 6/5 stars, all the way!"}
{"text":"Very good food and very good service.  I had the red sea sandwich and vegan chili.  Both were  tasty and the chili was super filling with a ton of beans.  The place was very busy when we went so service was a bit slow, but very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and was so glad I did.  Great food great staff. Everything on the menu was explained and was offered samples.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"While I am not a vegetarian, I do maintain a primarily vegetarian diet. This restaurant also has some meat selections if you'd like to bring a friend!  The hummus is a must try. We had the sweet-roasted red pepper hummus and it may have been the best hummus I have ever had. The pita chips were perfectly crispy and the hummus was creamy and delicious. I would absolutely recommend trying it!  The veg-o-matic wrap I had was just ok. I love sprouts so I was really excited, but especially when your wrap is only vegetables, seasoning the vegetables and having a good spread is very important. I found the vegetables a little plain. It's difficult to find good American vegetarian food, and while this is a step above other vegetarian food I have had, I found it just ok. 5 stars for the hummus, 3 for the wrap.   I would be willing to go back, but I would probably try one of their sandwiches with meat. I'd go just for the hummus as a snack!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night. Not very busy, may be busier during lunch hours. Ordered the falafel wrap, it was very good. The manager was very helpful explaining the menu and suggest options."}
{"text":"Good stuff here at Munch. The owners really care about the food they make and they are so nice. The food here is wholesome and prepared fresh. The ingredients are locally sourced. The menu has both vegan and meat offerings. When you walk in, the decor is bright and cozy. Various pieces of art decorates the walls. I saw discrete price stickers next to the art so some of it is for sale.  I ordered the pastrami on rye with mustard and a cup of the gazpacho soup. The pastrami was fantastic. Peppery and salty. It is tender and almost melts in your mouth. The rye bread was fresh, just the right amount of mustard on the sandwich. The spicy gazpacho soup was excellent. It is a cold soup with spicy heat that is addicting. The crispy pita chips were fun to dip in the soup.  I really like this place. The diverse menu will have me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Munch is my new favorite. I found it nearly a month ago, have already gone 3 times, and already know what I'm getting next time I go. Even if you're not vegan/veggie head, JUST GO!! So far my favorite has been the sesame dressing on the Cobb Salad and Julie's Tabbouleh. Drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Another 5 star review! Everything I have ever tried here is phenomenal. I try stuff here I wouldn't try anywhere else because I know it will be quality and taste great.   Don't hesitate to ask for a sample of their daily soup special either... It's usually a *wild* mix of ingredients but put together super yummy (pumpkin peanut butter? YUM!)   you really can't go wrong, are you vegetarian? Vegan? Meat eater? Than you will be happy here. I love the falafel options here too!   This place prides itself on fresh food and sustainability and they fulfill that at every turn. Definitely a lot of great food options that you can't find anywhere else... This stuff isn't sources from sysco or gfs, this is fresh food that you would find at miles market.  Give it a go! This many 5 star reviews and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food quality. Very fresh focused. Fast service. Set up for mostly takeout but you can eat inside or on picnic tables outside. Tomato basil soup with a great broth base featured rough chopped fresh tomatoes and small flat squares of onions. Simple food done well. Also enjoyed an all fresh chicken salad wrap filled with super cold and fresh veggies like carrots, celery, multicolored bell peppers and sprouts. Go here and be impressed and well fed. Takes someone and impress them that you found it first. Fresh is the motto here. Truly 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time trying it today. Food was great the pastrami sandwich is definitely worth trying.  Very clean establishment with great staff. Every thing is made to order and fresh. I will definitely be back. Only drawback is the seating is limited. But if you want something healthy and fresh this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. The Marv's club is a big sandwich and has great flavor. Can't wait to try more of their menu. Definitely recommend for a healthier option."}
{"text":"Lovely place with great interior art and atmosphere. The staff were extremely welcoming and the food was great for all audiences. Great veggie menu right next to a pastrami sandwich with nothing but meat!! Will be back"}
{"text":"What a great new addition to Solon! Healthy food and fresh! The owners are nice and take great pride in offering an excellent product. The interior is cute and it is popular at lunch."}
{"text":"Three coastal cousins, all vegetarian, have traveled to Clevelandtown for a wedding. The ceremony is beautiful. Tears are shed. Meat is served. We politely decline, and begin a quest for vegetables in an unfamiliar city.   The Internet guides us to Munch, and we are warmly received. From the parking lot, Munch appears to be a standard Midwestern wraps and sammiches, with no external clue to the vegetarian gem that lies within. The owners/operators warmly greet us, and explain the plethora of choices. After learning of our meatless preferences, the female half of the duo lists the most popular veggie options.  We three spit the Big-A, Julie's Tabbouleh, Velma's Veg-o-matic, and Papa's Portabello. The falafel was filling and rich. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked, toeing that delicate line between chewy and tender. The sprouts were present but not commanding. Everything was delicious.  The atmosphere is relaxed but lovely, local art hangs on the walls. We were offered water while we waited for take out.   We couldn't finish it all in one sitting, but the leftovers remained excellent.  I'd go back if I were in town longer."}
{"text":"What a GREAT little place!  The owner was working.  Very kind and helpful explaining all the menu choices.  I had the falafel salad...it's HUGE and delicious!  I also had the tomato and dill soup, sounds gross....it was delish!!!  Seriously I could have eaten more than 1 bowl!!!  This is a do not miss stop I promise!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and very reasonably priced! The owners are very friendly and explained the entire menu to me as it was my first visit. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Cute little family owned place with a hipster vibe. Great vegetarian choices. Owner was so nice, gave us samples and talked us through the menu."}
{"text":"First time going to Munch. Had a falafel wrap called the max. And it was right on! Wife had the cheapest falafel wrap I had the most expensive at $8.50 and we both loved them! We were both a little concerned that for 850 our wraps would not come with chips or fries, but that worry proved to be no problem after we saw how large the wrap was. Plenty of food for the money. Similar in taste profile to Tommys in Cleveland Heights (except that we didn't have any french fries... Not even sure if Munch has french fries...). Plenty of free parking, great service and good value. Plus it's right across the parking lot from the honey hut ice cream. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything was so fresh like they got it off the farm. My girlfriend loved her Cobb salad with turkey! I had the Marv club sandwich, excellent!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Munch off UberEATS twice. The first time I ordered Marv's club sandwich and chicken-less chicken noodle soup. Soup was ok- nothing special. Needed the chicken. The sandwich was good- really fresh ingredients and awesome bread. I would order that again.   Second order I got the the Hobb which is a falafel. Although it had a good amount of fresh veggies it was really dry. Said it came with tahini- but maybe they forgot... or it needed more. And the PB banana smoothie was really lacking."}
{"text":"Fresh and fabulous describes this place. Great sandwiches, wraps and soups. We all had the turkey club on fresh whole grain bread with herb mayo. Highly recommended. Make sure you find this little gem of a restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe I didn't discover this place until now. Think of all the crappy lunches I could have saved myself from!  Let's start with the food, because... obviously. I ordered Julie's Tabbouleh Falafel sandwich. Tender, perfectly made falafel folded in a warm, wheat pita with zingy tahini sauce, peppers, sprouts, tomatoes, hummus and tabbouleh salad. It had great crunch from the peppers, but was a great balance of texture and flavor. So many restaurants serve dried out pita, but this was perfect. The portion was more than enough for lunch-  they don't skimp here!  I was also pleased to have a delicious pickle spear and that they served fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea! The café is rather small, but has simple, trendy décor and colors. I loved that there was a drink station and condiments available so you could really get the best out of your meal. Everything was clean and orderly.  Now we can talk about the service! I was greeted immediately by two friendly faces. I told them it was my first time there and the man walked me through the menu and made recommendations. (Julie's Tabbouleh is a popular choice). I chatted with another girl, too, about their upcoming Yelp event! My food was prepared expertly and quickly and they brought it right out. I was happy with the price too. I had a nice healthy, filling meal for less than $10!!  I can't wait to go back and highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Very good Vegetarian And vegan food choices at an affordable price. Their wraps are my favorite and their vegan chilly At a short distance from work makes it a very convenient place to go for lunch, brunch or breakfast. And better than the other choices available."}
{"text":"First time stopping in and I enjoyed my experience. The owner was very nice and let me sample the black bean chili and coconut ginger soup which was delicious. I took her suggestion and got the turkey sandwich and it was amazing. I will definitely be visiting Munch again for lunch."}
{"text":"Love it .. As a vegetarian I don't find places which actually focus on good vegetarian fare. It's always a substitute which may not be very good . I happened to find this place in Yelp and went there for lunch with a colleague . Amazing food . She is very picky but even she loved it . Quantity is huge and I was planning on eating half of the falafel pita  . But then couldn't resist and finished it all as did she . Since then came here once again and the same quality and service . I had the Julie's tabouleh falafel and the Red Sea melt and both were amazing . I am certainly going to go there more often ."}
{"text":"Great food--we were looking for vegan and we were very satisfied. Made-from-scratch, by friendly owners. The Julie's Tabouleh, the black bean soup, the Red Sea. All delicious. Great coffee, too. Will gladly return."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner with friends. Total of 4 kids, one of them vegetarian. Food was amazing! We had the spicy lentil soup, falafel with tabouli, Pita pizzas, pb&j, Turkey club, pastrami sandwich and a Turkey sandwich. Generous servings, no one left hungry.  House brewed tea was tasty as well.   Staff/owners were so nice, and very helpful with tastings and decision making.  We enjoyed the local artists on display, and picked up several of their cards, as we live in Houston, Tx and were afraid of transporting it back.  We can't wait to visit again and enjoy this gem!"}
{"text":"Cute place with many options. Great portions. I wish they made their own hot sauce for the falafel. Highlight was the waitress/ bus's girl - she was amazing!"}
{"text":"They're averaging five stars as I write this. I wish I could agree, but after my first visit, I'm afraid I have to differ. The staff was good-natured and accommodating, and I love that the menu is vegan-friendly. The black bean chili, tasty and loaded with slices of fresh carrot, was a great start to my lunch. But my falafel sandwich was nearly bone dry and almost tasteless. The pita holding the sandwich contents seemed several days old. On balance, this was not a good meal. (And I'm easy to please when it comes to eats...definitely not a foodie.) I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Munch is good food for all diets, not just vegan and vegetarian...anyone would love the freshness of Munch.  Deli sandwiches, wraps, soft falafels, with meat and Mediterranean fillings like hummus, tabbouleh, 'shrooms.  Oh, so good.  Shakes, malts, smoothies, coffee, tea and parfaits finish the meal.  There's even a Kids' Menu.  Bright and colorful, this is a cute hangout with a big welcome sign.  The owner has traveled to the Middle East, so he knows his foods.  Pretty amazing to find a place like Munch off Miles Road.  Turn into the shopping center and it way back on the left."}
{"text":"Awesome food - always fresh, tasty, and thoughtfully made for you! So many choices for all - fresh meats, vegetarian options and vegan as well. Homemade soups, fresh wraps and huge sandwiches - the perfect place for a great meal!! Owners are super and wonderful to talk to."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant. The owners are so friendly and helpful and the food tastes great.   My felafel mushroom wrap was out of this world.   The fresh roasted turkey sandwich was excellent.   The fresh brewed coffee really hit the spot."}
