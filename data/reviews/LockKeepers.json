{"text":"Incredible service, food, and environment! From the valet parking to the dessert options ... this is the best!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! There banquet hall is beautiful as well. The staff is very friendly and provide great service!"}
{"text":"Service was exceptional.  Food was very good.  Location cannot be beat.  Outside is covered in case of rain.  My entire party had a great time."}
{"text":"Both food and service was excellent at Lockkeepers. There were five in our party and all five dishes and appetizer were excellent. Although we were full from dinner three of us indulged in desert which again was excellent."}
{"text":"The only downside to this restaurant is parking - so remember to valet upon arrival.  This is one of my favorites in town.  A recent lunch, I had a seared trout.  It was lovely.  At a recent dinner, my friend and I started with the cheese platter.  That was a nice compliment to the wine we selected.  The wine list is excellent.  Dinner - sea scallops prepared over risotto.  Nicely done.   Excellent spot for business dinners, large groups or small intimate dinners.  Just outstanding."}
{"text":"Outstanding service in a great atmosphere. Try the specials or whatever your server suggest and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner, had an. excellent Salmon meal.  One of the gentlemen was my date and he enjoyed a steak. All enjoyed their dinner and drinks.  This is always very good and ambience is great  which is often times difficult to find on a Sunday.   Cheers!  Rita B."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and overall we enjoyed it. Our server, Gabriel, was personable and friendly. I started with a cup of potato & leek soup that was ok - a bit bland for my liking but not bad. My husband had the wedge salad and really enjoyed it. For our entrees, I went with the beef medallions. The fontina was a nice touch and the beef was flavorful. It was slightly more medium well than the medium I ordered but still tender. My husband had the bone-in ribeye and loved it. We also had dessert (cheesecake for him, chocolate cake for me) and loved both. My only complaint in terms of the food are that the sides that accompany the steaks are not great for dishes that cost almost 40 bucks each. My meal waa paired with spaghetti squash that was bland and mushy and my husband's steak came with potatoes that really looked like glorified tater tots."}
{"text":"The food was very good as was the service--in fact the service was excellent. The one thing we weren't overly enthralled with was the \"vibe\".  Just a \"cooler\" feel to the place would have completed the experience."}
{"text":"Seriously fabulous food! Try the filet medallions & a Lock 39 cocktail! My husband & I went there for our first anniversary. Service was great & everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Consistently solid execution with great service.  Having won me over as a regular since Dante vacated, not one visit has disappointed."}
{"text":"I was on vacation from San Antonio and looking for a nice Italian restaurant to Celebrate 13 years of bliss ;-) with lovely wife.  Arrived 20 minutes early for a 7:30 reservation. Valet parking within 2 minutes if that! Although restaurant was busy, and I offered to wait at the bar.. we were immediately seated. Mussels appetizers were wonderful.. toasted bread to soak up all that delicious juicy sauce! The pork chop was excellent. A lot of complex flavors not a morsel was left. The seared scallops were perfectly cooked and delicious.. Spent almost 2 1/2 hours in a relaxing atmosphere... Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife and a friend on a Monday.  Since the weather was warm we ate on the outdoor deck overlooking the creek.  Very nice upscale environment both on the deck and inside the restaurant.  The patrons were businessmen in suits and others dressed as business casual.  Not really a jeans and shorts place.  Nice menu and good wine list.  Free valet parking.  My wife and I both had lunch salads and glasses of wine.  Generous portions.  Prices were reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Their service is as good as it gets and the food is amazing. Surprisingly reasonable prices for such a beautiful upscale feeling restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here--I looked forward to it all week.   I ordered a minestrone soup, ribeye, and a drink. First came out the bread, with an olive dip and some butter. It was very good. The minestrone came next and it was so flavorless and poorly cooked, I couldn't have more than a couple spoonfuls. I didn't even ask, but they were kind enough to take it off the bill.   When I ordered my ribeye medium, my waitress was sure to strongly mention that medium meant there would be a lot of pink throughout the meat. Good. However, when it came, there was no pink to be found at all. It was really tough and hard to eat. Definitely well done. I'd expect a lot more out of a $39 steak. Not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Pricey restaurant rides on its upscale image alone.  Food is okay, but nothing special.  I had the special sesame encrusted sashimi tuna.  It was slightly overdone, and i thought It was cut a bit too thick.  They have a large wine menu which was nice, but i think a little on the pricey side as well ($21 - 100+ per bottle with the average around $30)  Desserts were creative and tasty but I've had better.  The atmosphere was nice, and service was good.  Overall, I expected a lot more for the price."}
{"text":".Thanks to my excellent professional waiter, Rick, my husband and I had the most wonderful dinning experience. We always celebrate love and life and the ambiance, the great food, the drinks and our waiter Rick, all made it a wonderful celebration before our evening outing, and then the check was so reasonable for the high quality! Thanks for the excellence dinner with great value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful and moderately upscale restaurant, with the food priced accordingly. Fresh bread (quite good) and olive oil spread are on the house, though more than made up for with the rest of the bill. An entree of a pear-topped salad was good, although paying more money for something that is conceivably identical to a grocery store product never enticed me about going to restaurants. The pumpkin ravioli was also good, but the highlight was the eggplant rolentini, which was thinly sliced with the perfect balance of crispiness and seasoning. Save your waistline, though, as the apple cobbler was merely mediocre. Another guest had the canoli, which was deemed better. Many alcoholic beverages were also available.  Service, as expected for a restaurant of this caliber, was attentive and courteous, and the place looked very well polished and clean. Valet parking is available. Overall, a great place for a business dinner or for visiting parents or a treat for the spouse."}
{"text":"Had a birthday celebration here with close family and friends. There were 16 of us so I had picked out a special menu with apps, and entrees for this event and I had worked with Stephanie I believe her name was. She was so kind and helpful with everything. Our food was outstanding, and my pork was truly a melt in your mouth entree with all the flavors, and seasonings. The staff was nice as well and took great care of us.  Out of all 16 of us there was not one compliant with food, drinks, or service, so they obviously are doing something correctly at Lockkeepers. We will defintely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice happy hour atmosphere.  Met a group there and enjoyed appetizers and drinks in the cozy bar.  The flat bread pizza was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, well prepared and fresh. Seafood diavolo .. Seafood cooked well, not over cooked, pasta was cooked well, sauce good but not great. Filet mignon was well prepared...perfectly pink center. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"It was hard to decide on a star rating. This restaurant is located less than a mile from where I've been going to the doctor for a broken arm. So we jumped at the chance to try them for lunch. We went two times, and I am unsure we will return. But why not give it a third try to match the three stars I gave?  Our first meal there we shared a fresh pear and gargonzola arugula salad. It was refreshing, well seasoned and while a bit heavily dressed for my taste, the dressing was not overwhelming. I had chicken picotta, which was delectable, he had the quite reasonably priced filet mignon ($12) which was sizable and perfectly cooked. Sounds great, right?  But the following week I went back to the doctor and we had our second LockKeepers meal.   Holy canoli, Italian-cravers. I ordered a side of steamed brocolli in exchange for the house salad...it was cooked to smithereens. I put my fork in and the majority of the floret fell to the plate in clumps. I forced myself to eat it because brocolli has calcium and calcium helps bones. I expect the veggies in federal prisons are more delicious. Then I made a hearstaggering choice between lasagne and bolognese. Both are among my favorite foods. I chose WRONG!! I went with lasagne and it was basically a bowl of sauce with some meat swimming in it and one globinous piece of cheese. He got crabcakes==it was the bad kind of crab, not the lump meat and he said it tasted fishy and gross.   So, one five star meal, followed by a one star, 3 stars for now. I may have a third just to see, out of sheer curiosity in the mathematics alone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Ambience was appropriate for upscale dining.  Especially fond of the seafood risotto special.  One of the best meals I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"excellent food, service, and atmosphere.  lovely outdoor patio for the summer time.  the food is a little pricey, but worth it, they also have nice happy hour/lunch specials.  very friendly bartenders as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. This was our first time dining here and we were thoroughly impressed.  The calamari was delicious, as was the lobster ravioli and grilled salmon entrees. I would highly recommend dining here, and I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I went for lunch a few months ago. My food was delicious and the service was great! It's a little pricey but worth it. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went to Lockkeepers last night to celebrate our 52nd wedding anniversary and had a fantastic meal!  I've eaten there for lunch two or three times previously, but this was the first time I'd been there for dinner.  Expected it to be pretty slow since it was a Monday evening, but was shocked that the place was packed!  Perhaps because of the RNC convention in town next week.  Nonetheless, the service was perfect, and our waiter, Phil, was great.  Very attentive, despite a full room, and knowledgable about the entire menu, including the specials.  My husband had the lasagne, which came in an individual baking dish, and was a portion large enough for two!  He loved it, and to my amazement, ate every single morsel.  I ordered two specials. The Buffalo Mozzarella salad with a beet reduction vinaigrette. I could have licked the plate!  The Mozzarella was delicious, light and almost airy, and the dressing was perfect.  My entree was Pappardelle with a light white wine sauce, herbs, and seared scallops.  It was exquisite!  The portion was huge, with five full sized scallops which were seared perfectly.  I took half of it home.  Even the valet service was fast, friendly and efficient.  I'll definitely return for dinner!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal at Lockkeepers so wanted to take my in-laws here for their 30th wedding anniversary. This experience certainly did not disappoint! Emily Q was perhaps one of the best waitresses we have had anywhere. The wine and food recommendations were spot on and the meal was very well paced. We will be returning for many a special occasion in the future."}
{"text":"While I generally enjoyed my experience here.  The initial impression was one of awkwardness.  There was a wine tasting going on in the bar/lounge area, and the hostess/staff had no idea of where to seat us.  The initial idea was to put us in the lounge (???), but thankfully they decided to put us in the dining area.  We were told several times that the dinner menu wasn't available (duh! really no dinner at 4pm, sorry but I'm not new), which wasn't a problem as we were just looking for some nibbles and drinks.   So outside of the service glitches, the food is very good.  We got the calamari salad, the pizza of the day and a pitcher of Basil Mojitos.  The salad was flavorful, with sun-dried tomato, olives and just the perfect drizzle of olive oil.  The pitcher of Mojitos was a wonderful surprise and I can't wait to make a version of it at home.  When back in the area, I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"It was one of the best meals I have had in a very long time....The Pork Chop was to die for!"}
{"text":"I always have an excellent meal here. Their seasonal pumpkin tortellini is excellent. Great salads and soups for lunch. Best service around.  Beautiful decor for the holidays.  It's one of my favorites in Cleveland. Make reservations especially during the holidays.  They get very busy!"}
{"text":"Our company had our Christmas dinner last night and I love love love this place. I'm a service snob and the servers are the best here. Intelligent to speak of the wines they suggest to pair with dinner. The restaurant was very busy for 3 hours straight and the staff never missed a beat in keeping wine glasses filled, timeliness in getting food out to the table and honoring a couple of special requests. Monica was our server and she is a true professional at her job. I had the seafood risotto and is amazing. If the service is impeccable, it makes most any meal taste even better. Thank you to the staff at LockKeepers"}
{"text":"In town for a business meeting, was supposed to have lunch with a friend here who had to cancel at the last minute...I decided to go eat anyway. Even though I was by myself during the busy lunch rush, the hostess Renee went out of her way to make sure I had a nice table and make me feel welcome.  Had the lobster ravioli which was amazing! Great balance of upscale but hospitable atmosphere and great food. Impressive wine list also.  Will be coming back on my next visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for various functions and meals.  The food is rather typical Americanized Italian.  There isn't really any standout piece to this restaurant other than it feels like a 50's corporate board room!  My experiences here have been consistent.  Good service, decent food, and a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times and first time to write a review. I think this restaurant is one of the best kept secrets in the Cleveland area ! I have never never had a bad meal here, the service and atmosphere is top notch !  One of my favorite appetizers is the Tuna Tartare, it is outstanding. The desserts are great also !  Try it you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"This is the best dining experience I have had in Cleveland. You have to pick this restaurant especially if you are celebrating a special occasion. The best servers in Cleveland, awesome food, great desserts, delicious drinks and the decoration and ambiance of the restaurant is great to impress a special one.  Food - I only eat seafood so I cannot comment on the meat but my party ordered the fillet mignon and the filled pork chops and they wouldn't stop talking about how good it was. Pumpkin raviolis was probably the best pasta dish I have had. The butter sauce on the ravioli was slightly sweet but also salty. I ordered the ravioli with marinara sauce and it was good but not very flavorful so I wouldn't recommend ordering their ravioli with marinara. I loved the tuna tartare, it has potato in the bottom.... I wanted to get it as my main course! The salads are spectacular... so many ingredients and flavors. I had the Arugula with Fig and also tried the Baby Kale with Blue cheese, I couldn't pick my favorite but I recommend getting two half salads instead of a full one so you can try more. Desserts - It was a birthday so we had a sampler with all the top desserts.  Chocolate cake - really rich and buttery Dulce de leche icecream - small but really light in flavor and texture. Great caramel flavor. Carrot Cake - I thought was a little on the dry side but the spices on it and the frosting were really good. The winner was the CHEESECAKE! It was fluffy which is weird to see on a cheesecake and with a rasbery and whipcream frosting topping.  Service - BEST SERVICE I have in a restaurant. Waitress was so accommodating, very fast and attentive. They have this special private room near the wine cellar that sits around 6 people. That's what we had and made the whole experience so unique. They treated us like royalty the whole night and we really didn't want to leave.  Price - It is fine dining so if you want salad, drink, entrée and dessert you are looking at $40+ a person, depending on what you order (plates were from $14 to $48) The bad thing is that nothing will top this great experience. RECOMMENED 100%"}
{"text":"Can't say enough how much I love this place!  The lobster ravioli was the best I have ever had with actual sizable chunks of lobster in the ravioli! The rest of my table loved their food too. Then to top it off they brought us a free dessert to try which was an amazing cheesecake with a side of iced wine!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  We tried almost every appetizer on their happy hour menu, and were pleased with everything.  I especially enjoyed the stuffed pepper.  The restaurant is much larger inside than I expected, with multiple private dining areas.  The decor definitely looks \"expensive restaurant\" without being too gaudy or dated.  I have not been here for anything other than happy hour, so I can't comment on their regular menu.  I would not hesitate to come back for another happy hour though."}
{"text":"Fabulously good food-- consistently.  A friend and I went for New Year's Eve.  We shared the calamari which was excellent.  I had the Frank' salad which was huge-- lightly dressed and delicious.  I had the lasagna and my friend had the lobster.  Both were excellently prepared.  And how could I  forget the tomato basil artichoke soup which was a delight-  we finished off with the cheesecake for dessert.  The service is exceptional.  Definitely one of the nicest restaurants in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Lockkeepers is excellent!  Great food! Great Drinks! Wonderful Staff! You couldn't ask for anything more. It is definitely worth a visit. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I must preface this by saying that I didn't really have a true \"restaurant\" experience here.  I went to my husband's company Christmas party here last night.  I was simultaneously impressed with, and turned off by, the complimentary valet parking.  I nicely declined even though it was free.  I just hate valet parking.  I was coming from work so was kinda dressed \"business casual\" for this event, and I didn't feel under dressed.  It was appropriate for the type of place it was.  We had a really nice banquet room, complete with not-so-gaudy Christmas decorations.  The carpeting reminded me of being in a hotel, which, come to think of it, isn't so bad, because I like hotels, but I'm not a huge fan of eating in them.  The appetizers were really good.  Great, even.  There was bruscetta, spinach dip with pita, a meat and cheese plate...even VEGETABLES!  Yup. I was able to get my daily allowance there.  I also got my daily allowance of pizza.  Times three.  Both the pepperoni and plain were really tasty, although they got cold quickly.  Well, whatever, it's still pizza, and good doughy pizza at that (I think it was on foccacia-type bread).  The pastas, however, got a big \"Hell Naw.\"  There was a penne with a VERY heavy, yet extremely bland, alfredo sauce, to which one man said in reaction, \"This has gotta be good for my heart.\"  The other pasta selection was a fusilli (corkscrew/squiggly pasta that I can only imagine little kids eating) with a red sauce that I think was a lame attempt at an arrabitata sauce, but I can't be sure because other than a hot jolt of pepper, it too had no taste.    I soon discovered that mixing the two together on the plate provided a better tasting pasta overall...BUT unless you're at the Olive Garden and get the Taste of Italy, you can't really order two dishes on one plate.  So skip these pastas.  Overall though, nice and friendly atmosphere.  Everything was catered extremely well; the food was constantly being replenished, as were our drinks (a plus!).  While I would probably never come here just to eat a meal, I had a good time last night and the staff were extremely professional."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets such good ratings. I was mislead. The seared tuna was bland. I had to put the garlic and oil bread dripping sauce on it. Then it taste pretty good. The combination of olives was alittle off with that delish. And the potato slices probably added up to one fingerling potato.  The tomato basil artichoke soup was good. My martini was ok. But the service was awful. I wish I knew my waitress name. I think she was a bartender.  She took forever and barely looked me in my eye let alone in my direction. I will not be back.."}
{"text":"For one why is there such a parking lot feud amongst the business owners to the point that they mark their spots so you can only valet or park a mile away at this restaurant.  It doesn't show anything elite just inconvenience.  It was nice the first time, if you don't valer tho, there's no where to park.    Julie our server was not very ambitious, had attitude & took forever at the end with the check.  I asked if they had Absolut Vanilla, she said Stoli & some other flavors, but didn't seem like she wanted to check so I ordered wine.    The special soup w/ kale & chicken was blah.  I ordered what Karen our last server recommended the Yellowfin Tuna crusted in black pepper & a spicy tomato sauce.  The sauce was great & must have covered up for the bad tuna cause after I ran out of sauce, it didn't taste so good.  Immediately after, I was in the bathroom dying of food poisoning.    Yes it was the tuna cause I had breakfast at 8am, got on the plane was fine & ate here at 6pm on 5.16.18.  First Yelp review I've ever had to leave about food poisoning.   I am still suffering today 30 hours later."}
{"text":"The service at the Happy Hour at the bar was wonderful. Kudos to the barmaids.  F"}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day last month, with the family.  Dishes had a distinctly Italian flair to them.  Tomato basil artichoke soup was creamy with chunks of tomato and artichoke throughout and had a rustic tomato flavor.  I had the Lasagna, which had the same rustic tomato based sauce on it with four cheeses, giving it a pungent flavor.  I did not try the other entrees, but everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered.  For dessert, we shared a vanilla gelato with warm peanut butter and dark chocolate sauces for the table.  It was delicious...lasted a few seconds. ;-)  Lovely atmosphere for a \"special occasion\" type of place, service was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived in northeast Ohio as long as I have and I never went here. My boyfriend and I went for a late lunch and we were more than impressed. We were basically the only ones there for a while which was so nice. Our waitress was so helpful and nice. I ordered a valley view manhattan and my boyfriend got a beer from Italy. Both were very good. Beef carpaccio was our appetizer of choice and it was AMAZING. We loved it. They had a special with fish and ratatouille, which my boyfriend ordered. I got the grilled Atlantic salmon. It was love at first bite. We had zero complaints. We ordered cheesecake for dessert which was delicious as well. I've never been so pleased with a place on the first try. The food, service and ambiance was 100% on point. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I understand this location has been quite a few different concepts and it has been  LockKeepers three times.  We came in for lunch / meeting on Monday.  The A/C was running hard (good thing).  The service was attentive and knowledgable.    We all had the fixe price lunch and it was prepared just as advertised.  Great ice tea.  We ended up staying for almost three hours, our meeting ran over, with nary a peep from management.  They continued to smile, top off our teas, and ask if they could help.  They could not have been more accommodating.  Kudos for this.  Bathrooms were immaculate.  Great spot if you are in the Rockside Road area and you need good food and an accommodating environment."}
{"text":"I would give 10 stars if I could. We sat on the patio which had a very nice ambiance. Our server was Gabe and I can't say enough good things about how great he was. We went for our anniversary and they went out of their way to make it just a lovely experience. On top of that, everything was absolutely delectable. I can't wait to go back!!!!!  Also, I know others commented that that parking is difficult. Valet is complimentary which worked perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"Lockkeepers is one of the most consistent restaurants in the area...consistently great food and service.  The bartender (short, dark hair) makes a hell of a Manhattan and Martini).  Dinner on the patio was lovely.  I opted for the spinach salad with grilled salmon and my friend got a salad with grilled chicken.  Both were delicious and nicely presented.  The bread, butter, and olive tapenade with garlic and sundried tomatoes kicks ass.  I haven't eaten that much bread in years.  Damn that stuff is good.  Our server was kind enough to bring some plain salad green greens in a to-go box so we could have fresh salad with our leftovers.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the wilted spring mix in my salad. I sent it back and the only apology I got was from the server. In my 30 years as a chef in fine dining if someone didn't send a chef or house manager to a complaint the server lost their job and the customer was called that evening. I never saw the manager or the chef. It was early Saturday and not that busy yet. I think it was a failure in management. (I was still charged for the salad even though I didn't ask for a replacement.) $90.00 for dinner with no alcohol!!! and this kind of service!? I won't be back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. This is THE place I go to for all family events (birthdays, anniversaries) and where I stop EVERY time I'm headed up to Cleveland to catch a game or show. I love the atmosphere and the service is always exactly what I expect it to be. Not to mention the food is delicious!  We live 45 mins south and it's definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Oh gosh. You wouldn't expect the interior of this building to be so spacious and well-decorated, but it was. I came with a lunch date and found the menu items that we ordered to be spectacular.  I had the Chicken Scaloppini - the meat was tender and easily sliced through as well as definitively dripping with flavor.  The sides of garlic roasted mashed potatoes and vegetables (I believe I had some sort of roasted squash and zucchini) were great - the potatoes were creamy and the vegetables were fresh and cooked to the exact amount of tenderness.  My date had the gnocchi, though by the time he had finished his salad he was a little too full for it. Generous portion sizes here.  For the lunch menu, the prices were more than affordable especially given the quality of our food. The service was attentive though not overly friendly.  I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"the setting was a sunset dinner aside the river in a high ceiling wood paneled main dining room... comfortable warm settting...attentive experienced staff.... Raymond Cabernet Napa average, grilled salmon with polenta and grilled peppers/squash/asparagus good to above avg, as were the crab cakes; cheese ravioli avg,, tiramisu excellent. very relaxing time with comfortable decibel level too :)"}
{"text":"Food was OK. I ate here for a dinner meeting 2 nights in a row. My salads both nights were a little wilted. Filet mignon was served at room temperature. Wine selection was nice and the servers were attentive. Chicken piccata was pretty dry and had literally 3 capers. The first night I parked my own car as there was a spot very close to the entrance. The second evening it was 10 degrees out and very busy so I allowed the valet to park. On receiving my car back, I noticed the driver's side window trim had been ripped off of my convertible top. Of course the valet claimed no responsibility for this and I had a cold drive home. Even though the food and service is good, I wouldn't bring my wife here as I will not trust the valet again and we can't walk half a mile in frigid weather when she has asthma."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 colleagues on a business trip. We drove by the first day and there was a Lamborghini parked out front, so that caught our attention and brought us in the next day for dinner.  The service was excellent and ambience very comfortable.  I had fra diavolo. The seafood portion was large. The half lobster tail was over cooked and shriveled, but did not ruin the plate. The spaghetti was homemade (I think) and I could have eaten another plate of that alone. The sauce was not overly spicy.  Dessert I chose a chocolate cake while everyone else had tiramisu. No complaints from anyone.   All in all a great meal and superb service. Next time I'm in town I'll swing by again."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my new favorite special occasion/celebration restaurants. This place is classy, dressy, pricey, romantic, dimly lighted, quiet, and fancy. The service and staff were great. My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day. We made reservations 2 weeks prior and they only had one reservation for 8:30pm. Our waitress checked in on us an appropriate number of times. They started by giving us warm bread with delicious tapenade and soft butter. It was fantastic. Once we finished they brought another bread and the tapenade and butter. Our waitress explained the specials and answered our questions perfectly. All the food was brought in on time and at the same time. We did not have to wait for a long period of time. We got the meat and cheese board and everything was great and a good portion size. Then we asked to split a Ceasar salad and they split it for us without us asking. I ordered the Porkchop wrapped in prosciutto with the risotto and green beans. Honestly, the best risotto I've ever had.  The green beans were nice and crispy. The porkchop was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great. My boyfriend got the breaded veal dish with spaghetti and I liked it even more than mine. The veal was superb and the spaghetti sauce was great. The portion sizes were large so we ended up bringing home leftovers that were just as good as the first round! We got the tiramisu which was a slight disappointment. The lady fingers were kind of dry but we ended up pouring our cappucinno into it. Everything else was so delicious I didn't even care. The drinks were great especially my boyfriend's Tom Colins drink. Our waitress brought complimentary pink dessert wine which was bubbly and great with the tiramisu. They are known for their wines so I would definitely go back there and try it again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful dining room. Excellant service. Food very good. Excellant bread. Excellant gelato."}
{"text":"Absolutely exquisite meal. I had one of the handful of specials for the evening: a risotto with a lobster cream sauce that included scallops and a small lobster tail. This was so rich and flavorful that I ate far more than I should have and still took 1/3 of it home. The quality was excellent and the portions were larger than I wanted. The waitstaff was knowledgable and attentive. For the food, this was quite inexpensive. The wine list is also excellent with many European wines a in their cellar as well"}
{"text":"We stopped at this gem based on reader recommendations.  Amanda helped with great suggestions including caprese salad, truffle risotto and THE best cheese cake I've ever had at a restaurant.  Great menu items.  Not a criticism, but if traffic noise freaks you out, ask for inside seating.  Do visit this delightful establishment.  The food was more than a meal, it was an experience."}
{"text":"Very nice building, excellent food and very good service. It was a business dinner with 6 people. We had a very comfortable round table and the noise level was perfect to have our conversation. Very affordable for the quality, and a very complete wine list."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is that they make me not want to go to any other restaurant.  The food, atmosphere and service are top notch.  Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Happy hour review!  I stopped in a few minutes before happy hour started  (4-6) on a Friday evening and there were about 6 other people at the bar.  But this place was packed by the time I left at 6pm plus a wedding reception in their upstairs banquet room.  From my experience it is easy to see why all these people stopped by: the food and drink are fantastic. I eat Brussels sprouts off every menu and they have some of the best I've ever eaten.  The crunch, the seasoning, the taste on these were perfect! I also enjoyed the sausage stuffed peppers.  For the drinks I tried the peach Bellini and loved the Italian margarita.  This margarita replaces the triple sec with amaretto and it is fabulous.  I know I will be back in for those Brussels sprouts and maybe give their dinner menu a try too."}
{"text":"Had a lovely holiday meal with work friends in private room. Great food, staff and service. Try the Lock 29 cocktail!"}
{"text":"LockKeepers is right up the street from where I work, Praise the Baby Jesus a decent place to go to lunch!  The food is beautifully prepared and the service has almost always been stellar.  Yesterday was no exception.  If you have the opportunity as for Jackie R; she was an awesome server!  My boyfriend and I periodically rendezvous at LockKeepers for lunch.  He meets me there and it feels like a clandestine meeting even if it is wholesome.  My favorite lunches are on the nice days when we can dine on the patio.    The LockKeepers pronto luncheon special is quickly prepared and exactly the right size for a meal.  This changes with the season and daily, so make sure to get the specials from your server.  Yesterday, my boyfriend enjoyed the lasagna.  A large portion of lasagna was served in its own lasagna pan, while not the best I've ever had, it meets a need.  I enjoyed \"Frank's Salad\" with a portion of rare tuna on the side.  While the salad was perfect and the tuna amazing I don't think the tuna portion size warranted the $12 additional for the fish.  (A bit high for market value right now.)  We enjoyed post lunch coffee and espresso with the flourless chocolate cake.  The dessert was the perfect portion for my handsome companion and me to share.  I wasn't in DIRE need of dessert so if you're really needed the sweet, order your own. :) While I have never been to LockKeppers for dinner, I have requested the dinner menu to compare to the luncheon menu.  There is a slightly expanded selection of food and the sandwiches are not as prevalent.  I have no doubt that dinner would be just as lovely if not more so than the lunch. Try LockKeepers , it is one of the few restaurants left that understand appropriate service and food preparation."}
{"text":"One of the better meals we've ever had.  I had the seafood risotto (lobster/bay scallops/shrimp) and my wife had seared yellowfin tuna. Both dishes were outstanding. Service was excellent - very friendly staff. Nice atmosphere - \"clubby\" and upscale but not the least bit pretentious.   Not a cheap place but certainly worth it. We would definitely return on an upcoming visit."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. Everything from the location to the valet to the sauce to the wine selection to the soup to the meals... everything. Never disappoints and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The seafood pasta was spicey and excellent.  Worth getting my shirt ruined by the sauce from trying to carefully eat the pasta."}
{"text":"Our group of four and a toddler had wonderful meals and service. Prices are reasonable and the food is great. I will definitely return for another meal and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. It is a very nice and impressive place. The waiter was very on point with all the special things they do and timely. It was a great choice for a business affair but the bf and I won't be coming back here. Mostly because we know where to go to find food just as good for less money. I think part of what you are paying for is the atmosphere, which is desirable for certain occasions. The food was great, I had the salmon and it was cooked just right. The soup I had was great too. As were the cocktails. But the bf wasn't very fond of his lobster risotto and said it had a fishy smell and taste so he didn't finish it."}
{"text":"After endlessly delaying my initial visit to this timeless classic, I finally decided to stop by after work - and what a great decision it was! Even for an upscale establishment, the prices are reasonable and the portions are generous enough to make you reconsider getting dessert. Furthermore, the service was quick, attentive, and friendly.   Upon walking in you are immediately shrouded by the intimate, low-lit interior, which was set against a backdrop if wooden cloth covered tables. I sat at the bar where I was quickly greeted and offered a choice of drinks, which I declined, but did order a cup of minestrone and the spinach ricotta cavatelli. The bread that comes standard with all entrees is accompanied by a housemade whipped butter and an olive tampendade, which paired exceptionally well. Now for the main course, the spinach cavatelli was simply outstanding, with a nice blend of sundried tomatoes, garlic, and cherry tomatoes that lit a fire on my taste buds! One distinguishing feature of this place is the authenticity of their menu; that is, if you're looking for Italian cusine that is more typical of what you would find in Italy, then this place has it."}
{"text":"Nothing special . Had the seafood pasta. It was just okay. Would i come back again? No!"}
{"text":"I had the tuna tartar appetizer which was utterly tasteless and the ribeye which while cooked well wasn't seasoned properly. I'll take a pass in the future and try someplace different."}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times and have always been impressed by the expert waitstaff and the excellent cuisine. Today I had a heirloom tomato and corn salad with and Italian vinaigrette that was fantastic and for the main course freshly made mushroom tortellini in a cream sauce. One of the lunchtime meals ever."}
{"text":"2nd time at the Lockkeepers.. Ordered the same thing .. Spicy pasta with seafood (yea ..really don't know how to pronounce) but fav!! Yum yum hav to try when in good ole Independence, Ohio."}
{"text":"What an amazing upscale Italian restaurant. Looking at some of the reviews on yelp, I thought it was going to be one of those small portion restaurants but I was wrong.  The portions, depending on what you order, are perfect. The food was exceptional! One of the best salmon dishes we have ever had. The charcuterie board was delectable, eggplant rolatini was to die for and the lasagna was perfect!  We will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a work colleague the other night and it was a really nice dining experience. Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. The ambiance is dark and would be a great place for dinner with that someone special. They have a nice wine list. I started out with a chopped salad which was excellent but had their pasta special which was the thin lasagne type noodles, i forget what they're called with clams in a wine and garlic sauce and it was ok. I honestly had food envy as my colleague had lobster ravioli which looked awesome. Mine was a case of the clams being pretty tiny and there was way too much pasta, although the sauce was good. Would I go back, you bet, but would try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurants in the area. Flavors are just right and hit the spot every time. Great service and love their chocolate mousse cake as final dessert.  The fillet mignon was tender and good with wine."}
{"text":"I eat here every couple of months. Typically the service is excellent, the food as well. Though the lobster ravioli was a bit chewy.  So why 4 stars? I was a bit irritated. It was a Thursday night, an old friend and I went out to grab a bite after I had finished a speaking event nearby. She and I settled in to our seat (2 women, look to be in our 40's, dressed in black - more NY work clothes).  We were chatting, catching up.  The waitress  (50 yrs old) asks if we are celebrating any special occasion.  We pause, ummmm....no, just getting together. Then she asks if we are from out of town. We pause, ummmm...no. Really awkward exchange, drawn out, she was perplexed. I don't think the two businessmen next to us were asked if they were celebrating a special occasion. Maybe we looked like a couple (romantic, not friends)? Or too poor to afford the place?  My $2,500 Louis Vuitton bag on the chair didn't make that clear?   Lol.  My friend and I looked at each other, paused to answer both questions, it was odd. So that was a downer. I get those reactions in all male business environments \"you....you are the expert in xyz.\" But judgement from a waitress?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite all around restaurants. Lockkeepers offers high end quality food with an emphasis on Italian cuisine, but also limits its menu to a $30 limit, with many entrees between 15 and 20 dollars. The service is outstanding, the food is consistently delicious, the view is beautiful, sitting on Cuyahoga Valley National Park. It is especially beautiful in the autumn as the leaves are changing.  In addition, if you are ever looking to have a private event, I had a dozen friends for dinner in their Sommelier room, and it was incredible. There is no room fee, just a very reasonable minimum spending amount, and the room is exquisite, plus your own server. The room is up high, overlooking the normal dining room and right next to the large wine cellar. They have other larger rooms for weddings, business events, etc. Management was extremely accommodating and supportive and the night was great.  Lastly, their wine list is a jaw dropper, looking more like a text book when you first get it. Page after page after page of wines ranging from 30 dollar bottles to 1000 dollar bottles. They have some wine experts on hand to help you pick the perfect bottle. At dinner with my friends they selected a bottle of Cab Sav which, of nearly 200 bottles we have been through in the past few years (we keep track for our personal reference), it still stands as the best of them all."}
{"text":"Went to Lockkepers for a business dinner. Nice ambiance; I liked the vaulted ceilings and wood paneling. The restaurant is relatively spacious and good for large groups. The staff were very accommodating given that we were late by varying degrees, and our server remained patient with a large (and gregarious) group.  Appetizers: I tried the crab cakes, eggplant rollatini, sausage stuffed peppers and calamari. My clear favorite was the eggplant (mild but flavorful), followed by the crab cakes. I only had a taste of the peppers & calamari but they were above average.  I skipped salad, but everyone else appeared to have enjoyed theirs. For my entree, I had the pancetta wrapped filet medallions. The quality of the meat itself was very good, as was the port-reduction; but at this point in the meal, I was a bit too full to really appreciate such a rich main course. The accompanying vegetables and potatoes were just ok, but I'm not too surprised or bothered by that.  I tried a bite of the tiramisu and don't remember it being anything too special - it was good, but nothing exciting. On the other hand, the wine selection was excellent, as was the post-dinner espresso.   Overall, this is a good choice for an event like a family dinner (e.g. a parent's birthday or anniversary) or a business dinner. The restaurant is somewhat formal, but not black-tie fancy. I would not call Lockkepers \"cozy\", \"casual\" or \"romantic\" (at least, not in my book) but for the right type of occasion, this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner tonight. Had the veal chop and Frank's salad. Only thing is that there was a lot of food and I couldn't finish it all. Dined at the bar and service from Nate was spot on. Excellent mixologist and he knows his wines. This place is definitely recommended.  Not cheap, but the high quality is worth the price. Also, get a Negroni and $1 goes to Autism Speaks."}
{"text":"Patio was very nice, good service, Ravioli was okay, nothing too special. Orange spritz drink wasn't anything too special."}
{"text":"Excellent food, presentation, atmosphere, and bar....is there anything else to say?!  I went to this delish restaurant for a work dinner and was blown away. They start you off with fresh bread and a spread of butter or an olive puree. I had the night's seafood special of shrimp and scallops with a lobster tail on risotto. It was great and just the right size. The flavors were excellent and the seafood quality was great for Ohio. Everyone at the table was very happy with the meal and the service. We followed up with desert and everyone ordered a different dish, once again no complaints. The chocolate cake was something special though. It was made to order and amazing. After this huge meal I went with a tasty and strong espresso. All in all, a great restaurant.   If you were to go here for drinks you wouldn't be disappointed either. Their bar is very well stocked and even had a few Scotches that surprised me.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, I have yet to dine in the restaurant for a \"normal\" occasion. I have only attended lockeepers for events in the banquet room. Wedding shower, baby shower, etc.   With that said, I've had nothing but positive experiences. The place itself is beautiful. The staff is attentive. The food is delicious!  I have had the chicken scallopini and it was very good. The last visit I tried the eggplant rollatini and it was also very good!   I would highly recommend this place if you were looking for a place to have a shower or any other gathering and I will definitely make a trip to further explore the menu!"}
{"text":"I brought my wife here to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  We started with cocktails in the bar.  Erin makes a great drink.  My wife had a Cosmo while I had an Aperol spritz--a perfect refreshing drink for a hot summer day.  We met a nice couple and chatted away, soon it was dinner time.    As it was a special occasion, they gave us each a glass of prosecco to enjoy while perusing the menu.  We started with the charcuterie board, a generous assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, and olives.  I selected a light red Sicilian wine to go with our meal.  Next up was the special salad: radicchio, frisée lettuce, heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella.  The dressing was light and fresh.  We had a hard time deciding on our main course, but our waiter Scott made some good recommendations.  He brought out a sample ravioli with bolognese sauce for us to try--fantastic!  My wife got the lobster ravioli while I thought about the beef medallions.  Scott recommended I get the 8oz filet and he would have the kitchen prepare it \"medallion style\".  This is leeks, carrots, spinach in a Barolo glacé....wow, wow, wow!    Next up was complimentary biscotti with a wonderful warm chocolate gnoche.  We paired this with two cannolis--homemade and filled fresh--two espressos and 2 limoncellos, also homemade.    We met another nice couple from NYC and chatted with them over dessert.  What a wonderful evening.  From the friendly service, the good drinks, the delicious food, and the friendly people we met, it was a night to remember.    This place easily blows away the snobbier, and pricier, trendy places that charge more for less.  At LockKeepers, the value and the quality is there.    Mille grazie!!"}
{"text":"I was taken here for a surprise birthday/ Valentine's Day dinner. It was my first time ever dining here and it was everything an incredible dinning experience should be. Between the A-LIST service, the phenomenal food and the romantic view, they knocked it out of the park.   Here's how the evening went:  As we walked in to LockKeepers, the atmosphere oozed romance and swankiness.  The man who greeted us informed us that our table was not ready just yet and that we could take a seat at the bar if we would like to wait.  At this time I didn't realize this was all part of my date's instructions that he had sent to them in advance with the reservation online.  He wanted to allow us some time to relax at the bar, enjoy some great conversation and wine before dinner started.  As we approached the bar, the bartender gave us wine lists.  He walked away for a moment for us to look at them, all the while he was in on the secret that my date had already arranged for us to be served a bottle of my favorite wine. He brought it over and as we sipped our Malbec, we chatted and were soon seated at a cozy table by the window with an amazing view.  Our server was went above and beyond for us.  She brought over our crab cake appetizer and recited the most complicated, long, menu of specials I've ever heard. (I gave her a high-five to celebrate how awesome she was).  We had the tomato soup, which was phenomenal, and the chef sent us over the lobster ravioli to try on the house!  For dinner my date tried the Surf and Turf with lobster tail, Filet Mignon, asparagus and a potato cake.  I had the Seafood Risotto with shrimp, scallops and topped with a lobster tail.  We shared and let me tell you...everything was incredible.  You know that blissful, comforting feeling you have when you eat something simply divine? That's what this dinning experience was like, but x10.  By the time we finished our feast of gloriousness, I had no room for dessert.  Little did I know, my date had mentioned in his thorough instructions that it was my 25th birthday and that it was very important that I was treated well. Before I could refuse dessert, our waitress brought out plate with mini torts on it with a little, edible, Happy Birthday sign.  All I can say is that LockKeepers was probably the best FULL restaurant experience I've ever had. Every part of it was incredible and they treated us like we were celebrities. How many times can you go into a nice restaurant on one of their busiest nights of the year and be treated like you're the only ones there? That's pretty tough to accomplish. A lot of time you'll get the atmosphere or the service, but the food is only so-so. Not at LockKeepers. You don't sacrifice a thing.  On top of that, my date was blown away how closely they followed all of his instructions."}
{"text":"The pork chop was great. I wish it would have been cooked well but I'll keep that in mind next time. It was accompanied by a rice cake which was great. I wish I could order hundreds of them separately. Lol My boyfriend ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly. His only complaint was the undercooked rice.  The server wasnt too amazing but the other servers were pretty nice.   The Carrot Cake was amazing. There must be a joke amongst the staff about how big the carrot cake really is because two servers walked past and jokingly said \"Man that's a really small piece of carrot cake!\""}
{"text":"We have always had a great meal here. From beef tips to paste. Always great. I don't know what they could do different. Just keep the good quality of food and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience here the other day! I stopped in for happy hour (3-6p) and sat at the bar where I was served by Monica. Right from the start she was pleasant and helpful, then just as importantly, she gave me my space while still being readily available if I needed anything.   So what I learned about LockKeepers is that they are very accommodating, they want the guest to be pleased so they will work with you on creating a dish that best fits your taste buds. For example, you want that $7 happy hour special flatbread, but you don't like the flavor of the day, they will make you pepperoni and cheese flatbread if that is what you want for the same price. Or you want a salad but aren't that hungry, you can get half orders! Or you want the calamari appetizer, but don't want it fried, they will sauté it for you! Or you want their sorbet dessert, but only one scoop instead of three, they will make it work! Pleasantly surprising.   The goods: *Peach Bellini - Tasty. Good mix of alcohol and flavor. *Bread - you get butter and olive tapenade to spread on your bread. Very good! *Meatball - Large meatball with some read sauce on top of polenta. The meatball was good (ask them for fresh grated cheese on top), but the polenta was mediocre.   *Brussel Sprouts - Legit deep fried so not healthy, especially with bacon filled aioli, but pretty delicious. Tasted like they might sprinkle salt on it so I'd ask for it without that next time.  *Beet Salad - I always enjoy salad with beets, nuts, and goat cheese so no complaints here. Happy I could get half a salad.  *Crème Brûlée  - It comes with like jam on half of it and this almond brittle bake in the center (maybe too much happening?). I was excited for this dish but it just wasn't for me. The sugar crust kind of tasted like blow torch.   There was a small issue with one of my dishes but management took care of it generously.   All in all, I would definitely come back here. LockKeepers is a high class place with great service and good food without a stiff or overwhelming atmosphere.    Oh, side note on parking, you can park anywhere in the lot just disregard the \"Only for Yours Truly\" sign. Or you can take advantage of complementary valet parking."}
{"text":"It looks like I am going against the grain here, but I was not impressed. I was in a party of eight and the service was very inattentive. I was drinking water and couldn't get refills. We were never offered bread but all of the surrounding tables had some. The server didn't try to up sell drinks, appetizers or deserts. I had the tuna and it was good, but nothing to rave about. The restaurant itself is very nice and would be great for any occasion."}
{"text":"Came in around 3:15. I ordered wine & a soup. Waitress behind the bar was fantastic.  Shift change happened at 4:00 & the new waitress has totally ignored me.  After 30 minutes she hasn't said one word to me & there are only 5 people at the bar!!!  I want to order food but I may have to leave before I have the chance. Finally got my food & it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The service was great. The food was impeccable.  We had the wedge salad, the beet salad, and Cesar salad along with the mussels which were the plumpest I've ever seen.  For the main course we had gnocchi, scallops and the pork chop.  Fabulous!  And of course we couldn't leave without coffee and carrot cake oh and the peanut butter sundae. Oh so good.  I'm from ny and this Ohio restaurant was a great experience."}
{"text":"It was extremely busy.  The wedge salad was great.  The meal however was forgettable.  Not typical for this place.  I would say it is the best in cleveland."}
{"text":"Food was very fresh and great taste. Ate upstairs in the private room and would come back. Service was fair food was amazing"}
{"text":"Thank you to our server, Nathan, who provided wonderful service and was very personable and charming. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I recommend the tuna tartaro and the pork saltimboca. Delicious! The ambiance at Lock Keepers is very nice. Make sure to take a look around and check out the historic canal."}
{"text":"This is a review for their happy hour, which happens Monday-Friday, from 5-7pm in their lounge and bar.  Their happy hour is fantastic!! $4 glasses of wine and incredibly inexpensive and yummy food. $3 cheese plate, $3 bruschetta, $5 pizza and burgers and other high quality bar food. The ambiance is beautiful, large comfortable booths and couches at around tables. The bar stools are comfortable as well.   While I have never been here for a regular meal, I love their happy hour. It's a great place to check out. Friday's they even have free pizza. It's great to go somewhere super nice without spending a ton of cash. Their service has always been fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good wine selection, and the absolute hands down most delightful hostess and waitresses I've ever come across. I travel the country for work so that's tall praise coming from me. The calamari appetizer was unique and delicious. It was large and we split it three ways. The scallops with the cauliflower mashers were absolutely superb. The home made spaghetti and clams special was delicious. I had a cappuccino and raspberry sorbet for desert which was excellent and just perfect... Not too sweet. The complimentary valet guys were very nice as well. We had a great experience. Don't pass it up!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter brunch with my father after church service. This place is pretty large inside. The staff was very warm and welcoming. We arrived pretty early before our reservation so we sat at the bar and ordered two mimosas. Eventually we were seated for brunch. The space was very well decorated. The food selection was also great and delicious. The only knock was the space was pretty tight and they only had one designated area for the food. So there was a long line in the beginning -which made it hard to move around. Another area with the same food options would have helped deal with the Easter crowd. Other than that, this place is awesome! Try it out."}
{"text":"A really nice meal. Ate at the bar. Nice selection of beers, wines, and liquors. Pasta was homemade and cooked perfectly. Service was perfect."}
{"text":"I had dinner here while on business recently. The restaurant is elegant and has several private dining areas for small groups and good for business dinners. Overall it has a warm comfortable atmosphere with a nice bar area.   About the Food: The tap water should be filtered as I could taste the chlorine and it ruined the taste of any food, the bread was adequate but nothing special, the Caesar salad was cold, dry & wilted, it needed more dressing, croutons and cheese, it was very disappointing, the Mussels were overcooked & shriveled up like pearls to about a third of the size of their shells, the broth was completely tasteless, it might as well have been steamed in dishwater. The stuffed pork chop tasted good but was overcooked & dry, it was redeemed by the tasty risotto cake and vegetables, the Carrot Cake was served cold and not room temperature as it should be to release the flavors and soften the cream cheese frosting; it looked & tasted commercial as if out of a box from a warehouse store.   My waitress, the hostesses, and the valet attendants were just great they all get 5 stars but the food was really disappointing & lack-luster for a place of this caliber and price."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner and we had a wonderful time.  From start to finish, it was a great experience that was spot on.  We made reservations for a Saturday night, having never been here before, we were not sure what to expect.  We arrived and were very warmly greeted by the hostess and immediately checked-in and seated.  The restaurant was full, but not loud or overly crowded.  We were seated and almost immediately greeted by our server.  Our service the whole evening was spot on and we did not want or need for anything.  We started the night off with appetizers.  We had the Calamari and Beef Carpaccio.  Both of those were phenomenal with great balance and flavor.  We then moved onto the salad course.  I had the salad special and my husband had the Heirloom Tomato Salad.  Again, great food with flavors that were very well thought out.  Oh, I forgot to mention the bread - it was so good and served with both butter and an amazing olive tapenade.  I did not even touch the butter because of the tapenade.  Our entrees were spectacular and it is just so impressive that they make their own pasta.  My cannoli was delicious and very well executed.  The wine list is very extensive and there is something for everyone.  The timing of the entire night was great.  Our server did not rush us at all and we had a wonderful experience.  We will get back, we will bring friends and family here and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Well I'll be darned. I admit I've been here once before for a pharm-sponsored dinner and I walked away that evening thinking the food was average. The steak I ordered was overdone, and on the dry side.   I went again to give it another try.   Items ordered:  Mussels  Tuna tartar Frank's salad Scallops Bottle of red (can't remember the name)...  All of the food was satisfactory and quite tasty. I think with the amount of food, I was just stuffed to capacity and I wasn't able to finish all of my scallop entree. I liked the tuna tartar, which was served with a lemony sauce but I felt it could've had a bigger flavor punch, perhaps with some capers or something a little more zingy. The mussels were average. Loved the salad- had all my fave things. Scallops were yummy and cooked to perfection, and very rich-tasting. It was served on a bed of cauliflower mash (which I was raving about all while shoveling it in). This would be a GREAT substitute for mashed potatoes for those looking for low-carb. On the other hand, it was very creamy and probably heavy on the fat. And as we know, fat= flavor!   Oh, and dessert was a tiramisu, which was ok. Good coffee flavor but a little heavy on the cream for me.   Service was fantastic. I gave this place 1 star more just for the awesome and friendly customer service. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive.   If it wasn't so far away, I'd probably go back a few more times."}
{"text":"Dined here last night for our anniversary dinner and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place! First off, our server Gabrielle was WONDERFUL!! My boyfriend and I were both noting that he is one of the best servers we've ever had. He was attentive, without hovering and was confident in his suggestions on the menu (something that is very important to me).  The meal started with a complimentary glass of prosecco in honor of our anniversary. Then we had the award winning calamari. It was incredible! it does not come with dipping sauce, but I have to dip so I asked for some marinara and I am so glad I did because WOW was their marinara to die for!   My boyfriend ordered the black garlic gnocchi and he raved about it! I went with the seafood risotto and it was one of the most wonderful things I have ever eaten. The seafood was fresh, the portion was large and the lobster was so buttery! And the sauce! AMAZING!!  For dessert the brought us again complimentary mini biscotti and canoli with chocolate ganache dipping sauce. YUMMY! I still ordered a the cheesecake! SO fluffy and my boyfriend ordered the Peanut Butter Cup Gelato Sundae he loved it!  This was such a beautiful space and the attention to detail did not go unnoticed. We can not wait to go back. What a wonderful experience. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for two on a Saturday night. Seated immediately when we arrived. Service was rapid and polite. The table we were seated at had a wonderful view of the decor inside the building. I really loved the warm feeling it gave me. We had scouted out the menu here before hand and ordered the things we saw that looked interesting. I couldn't wait to try the scallop dish I saw. Then we started eating the food. Everything was bland and of very average quality. Dinner rolls, salads, lobster bisque... had no pop like I was being served reheated food from the supermarket. The appetizer was the fried mozerella... again bland and tasteless like a box of frozen TGI Fridays chessesticks. I held out hope for the main course and luckily it actually had some flavor to it. My date's fish dish was pretty bleh so she said but it looked good. We opted not to get desert for fear that it would be as bad as the other things we ordered. Paid the check which had somehow almost reached $100 (went over that with tip of course) and left pretty unhappy. My money would have been much better spent elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this overpriced celebration of bland food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Seafood Fra Diavolo and the Gorgonzola Crusted NY Strip and spilt the Tiramisu for dessert.  The sauce for the Seafood Fra Diavolo is very spicy which I didn't mind, but very thin which I did mind.  It was more like a broth than a sauce.  We had the waitress bring a side of marinara which helped. The pasta was cooked perfectly.  The Gorgonzola Crusted NY Strip was cooked the way I ordered it (medium) but it seemed as if because it had the Gorgonzola cheese that the kitchen didn't see fit to season the meat.    Nice place, good location and service.  Would like to go back on a warm day, eat on the patio and try different dishes."}
{"text":"We love this place and come for every special occasion. We go about 5-10 times per year for the past few years and have literally never had a bad meal. We love to bring people here that have never been and they are always very happy. Great food and atmosphere for sure. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Lockkeepers, I had very high expectations when I attended a special event there recently.  Pros: - Really beautiful space that creates a rustic, classy atmosphere. - Easy accessibility and fast valet service. - Quality food for a special event.  Cons: -      When I entered and asked the hostess where the event was, she didn't make eye contact and was less than thrilled to help me. Sigh. -      Slow service. I understand that a big room takes time to work, but half of our table never received their food. We did eventually flag someone down and ask, but it took a while since the servers did not circulate often. -      We gave our lunch orders ahead of time when we registered for the event. When we got there, they still needed to take our orders again. When they were brought to the table, some still weren't correct. With guests who have food allergies, this stands out to me.  Overall, I would be willing to come and try again, but for me, sometimes experience and service outweighs quality of food."}
{"text":"went here after a funeral (unfortunately) but the food was amazing, and the staff was super nice !!"}
{"text":"The food (everything) is absolutely delicious and the service is great.  If I could go here every day, I totally would."}
{"text":"Ooooh.  This place was amazing!    The ambiance was very rustic and and romantic.  Definitely a great place for a date with someone special.  The food was phenomenal.  I ordered the pork chop saltimbocca and I think it might have been the best pork chop I've ever tasted in my life.  It was stuffed with cheesy goodness and wrapped with proscuitto that gave the meat the extra flavor that pork chops tend to lack.   My girlfriend had the garganelli with shrimp and pesto sauce which she also absolutely loved.  The apple cobbler was delicious too - too bad we were so stuffed from dinner to properly enjoy it.  The service was on the spot - they checked up on us frequently and took care not to bring us our leftovers until at the very end of our meal so we wouldn't be eating in the company of doggie bags.    This restaurant is 40 minutes from our apartment and Little Italy is 5 minutes away.  However, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had in the metro Cleveland area.  We hadn't been here in years.  I looked at the menu online and the new Fall menu was so interesting we decided to go.  I had the Beef Carpaccio and believe me this is the best I have ever had in NEO.  It was generous and fresh and since I don't care for truffle oil, they were happy to substitute olive oil.  I ordered the pumpkin ravioli from the Fall menu and it was perfect.  My husband had a Frank's salad and the winner of the night the bone in pork osso bucco.  The meat was honestly like butter.  So perfectly cooked.  Our server Jen was top rate!  I have a garlic allergy and she was very accommodating and willing to as the kitchen questions.  This is one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in NEO n the past seven years and that includes all the CLE hotspots!  Do yourself a favor...GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in Ohio on business and colleagues recommended Lock Keepers for a nice dinner.  Boy were they right!!  A colleague and I went for dinner, and were given a nice table in their back room in the corner.  Ambiance was lovely after a long day - kind of dark and quiet.  Very relaxing and would be a very romantic spot for a date.  Their complimentary bread & butter are yummy.  I then got the tomato artichoke bisque soup as a starter (DELICIOUS), my colleague got the lentil/prosciutto which she said was good.  After our soup they brought us out a surprise treat:  a single cheese ravioli with their marinara sauce - free of charge - which was superb!!  Main course was their skirt steak with potatoes and chard - prepared perfectly and was very tasty.  Colleague had salmon with polenta which she said was very good.  We both had their Pinot Noir (by the glass) which was excellent.  Service was very polite, prompt & friendly.  We were stuffed and couldn't do dessert, but I imagine that would've been lovely as well.  Valet parking made dealing with the snow/ice much easier!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience from start to finish. I ordered the pasta with seafood and was treated to a generous portion of fresh seafood that surpassed even that which I had on my recent trip to Italy. Excellent service that felt attentive yet not intrusive. My party of 4 all enjoyed the dining experience. We all hated to leave and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"One of the best in the area. We have had a few parties there and the food and staff were amazing."}
{"text":"The service was slow but the food was delish! The calamari was truly the best I've ever had. As an entree I ordered the seafood fra diavolo- PERFECTION! This is a solid Italian meal and I'd recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"Good service. No parking close by but they have free valet service. Great steak and nice atmosphere. Solid choice in the area."}
{"text":"This semi-expensive, fancy-pants restaurant went from being LockKeepers to Dante and then back to LockeKeepers.  Even though it has a fancy-people-only feel to it, especially with their valet parking, you can still come here dressed down on casual friday and get away with getting a coke and a pizza, albeit a fancy pizza.  Their patio is really nice and overlooks a nice view of flowers, the canal, and some obnoxious street construction.  I'd say this is definitely one of the best places to eat at in the Valley View area."}
{"text":"The only reason that this get a three star rating is simply due to the waitress we had.  She alone carried the weight of this restaurant two more stars than it should be.  I wish I could remember her name.    After reading reviews about the place my wife and I went with high hopes for a lovely evening with great food and no kids.  This turned out to be a one and done visit.    The calamari was dripping with oil and over done.  All the sun dried tomatoes and other ingredients were on the bottom of the plate with the calamari on top.  This was our first sign that they just like to wear chefs clothing but they must not employ any real chefs.  The long bone veal chop was well prepared and  is exactly like what we had expected the food to be.  The seafood fra diavolo.   Was a huge disappointment.  The pasta in this dish.  Who ever made it should just be slapped, twice.  Once for playing chef and the second time for the insult to the pasta.  This not rocket science, it was just pasta.  Even Olive garden has never screwed up pasta like this clumpy stuck together crap in a bowl.  Nowet me help the kitchen staff.  Next time you place pasta in water.  1.  Make sure the water is at a full boil first. 2.  Place enough salt in the water so that it's like seawater  3.  Give it a good stir once preferably at least twice during cooking to make sure the starches from the pasta dont stick together.  Should probable had been taught this in your cooking classes or by your mother but just in case.  Now you know.  Now that we covered the pasta let's talk about the spicy tomato sauce. Might as well just rename this dish just spicy sauce. Could not even taste anything other than the spicy spice in the sauce.  If you just love the texture of different seafoods in your mouth but don't want to have to taste them this is the dish for you.  I do so love spicy hot dishes.  But this was supposed to be Italian not Indian.  What a waste of lobster and other sea food.  Now depending on where they seat you in this place.  Unless you are at the bar it's pretty much going to feel over crowded.  The tables are to close together.  For the price of the food and drinks this dinning experience should have been the best we ever had and it was no where near close.  Don't waste your money or time.  Go to Yours Truely across the way.  They have better food."}
{"text":"My cousin had her wedding here and everything was top notch! The service the food the cocktails. I had the best stuffed pork chop of my life. It was perfection. The desserts they provided were excellent as well. I can't wait to go back again. They made me feel like I was royalty. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Went there after procedure at Marymount Hospital. Just yelped it and was so very pleased in every way. We had a beautifully prepared delightful shrimp on a bed of polenta, heirloom tomato salad, gnocchi to die for, long bone veal, and surf and turf. They make a great Sidecar! The service was absolutely stellar. We plan to go back soon. Oh BTW, besides being a beautiful place it was NOTICEABLY SPOTLESSLY CLEAN. Not a speck of dust anywhere. I don't know how they do it!"}
{"text":"Really like it and will be back.  Top notch service.  High end setting.  Very good food."}
{"text":"After years of living in the area and talking about trying, we finally did tonight and were happy we did. It was delicious! The waitress started us off with the typical bread and butter, but also came with an olive tapenade, which I could seriously not stop eating. I am a always impressed with that extra touch, over just the bread and butter, which that alone my boyfriend was obsessed with. We then started our meal with a chopped salad, which we asked to have platted separately and was composed beautifully, and dressed perfectly. All the flavors popped in each bite, the lettuce was saturated in dressing, without being overdone. We practically licked the plate after the pieces of Parmesan fell to the last bite. This is a recommended starter. I ordered the seafood risotto for dinner, which was cooked to the right temps for both the risotto and seafood. Perfectly buttery and salty and substantial, without being just a filling, heavy pasta. My boyfriend ordered the strip steak. He ordered it medium and it was cooked exactly to his taste and basically melted in our mouths. It came with purple potatoes and a little squash salad. Both were platted beautifully. We ended with the tiramisu which I have to sadly announce we did not enjoy. It had too much of the amaretto flavor and was too sweet, we eat a lot of tiramisu and are pretty snobby about the desert and I think they need to step their game up on the desert. The drink I ordered, Lock 39, a prosecco beverage with lemon, tasted like I was drinking a lemon drop and was tough to drink all the way. Overall, we will absolutely return and will remember to make reservations bc we got there at like 5pm on a Wednesday night and wanted the beautiful patio they have but needed reservations, bc they were filled up. Our seat inside was fine, and we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great find.  A bit off the beaten path, but this place was great.  Tasty, fresh Italian fare.  It was a beautiful day when I went, so the patio was awesome.  The service was great too."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight. Service was friendly and efficient. Food was great I had the Italian wedding soup, arugula salad and chicken scallopini.  All great!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, location is good. Very easy to find, free parking. But its overpriced"}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to lunch at LockKeepers. Despite the ever-so-packed parking lot (and dining room, for that matter), I had a good experience top to bottom.   The ambiance is nice enough to merit a business suit yet chill enough to accommodate your khaki/polo shirt crowd. Our server was attentive and delightful, recommending the prosciutto, arugula and parmesan pizza. As always when I'm conflicted about what to order, I took her up on the recommendation.   Here's where the review gets really good.   This is what pizza is supposed to be like; simple, rustic, and artfully conceived. The crust was thin, crispy, warm and chewy. The flavors and textures of the toppings created a perfect compliment: paper-thin slices of rich, salty prosciutto, generous shavings of parmigiano-reggiano, crisp, peppery arugula, a drizzle of olive oil, and fresh ground pepper. YUM!   I'm going to save a higher rating until after I'm able to take advantage of the dinner menu. I might even up the ante by making the best of the warm, dark atmosphere by taking a date. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, every time we go there I leave in a food coma. Great atmosphere,  service and food. One of the best places I have ever been to eat at! If you haven't had the opportunity to try this place you're missing out."}
{"text":"Today I went with Tony Bones to a fantastic Italian resteraunt that I've heard about many times in the past but never had the pleasure of going to: Lockkeepers. Out of the blue he asked if I would join in there for lunch and I happily obliged. It's located right off of the tow-path and has a incredible view of the water rushing past, just a block down the road from the fully renewed Cinemark it's a beautiful place for couples looking to take a romantic rendevous or old friends wanting to catch up on old times such as the people we were sitting next to at the bar. We were greeted by the wonderful bartender who has a wide selection to a glorious wine, beer and liquor selection. We were on our lunch break so we stuck with water but I will be back for a nice cold glass of craft beer in the future. The menu selection is varied with something for everybody with plenty of nice vegetarian and vegan options as well.   They started off our dining adventure with freshly baked, firm, Italian bread accompanied by creamy, chilled whipped butter and a splendid melody of olive oil, olives and pepper that embraced the bread setting the mood of the delectable dining experience we were about the embark upon.    Next we continued our course with deliciously fried calamari with both breaded squid rings and whole miniture squid. Topped with finely sliced peppers, olives and mushrooms. It was a delicate dance of flavor and texture that played delightfully on your tongue.    My main course was some of the best chicken parmesan that I ever had in my entire life. The spaghetti pasta was aldente firm and the perfect texture. Mixed in with a incredible red sauce in which you could taste the red wine that they used to accent the natural flavors of the tomatoes and spices. The chicken was cooked to perfection so tender and moist and topped off with the perfect amount of lightly melted parmesan cheese. This was all topped off with fresh ground parmesan cheese.   My colleague ordered the Penne Pasta Bolognese with the same wonderfully crafted aldente pasta and a fantastic Bolognese sauce that was loaded with mouth-watering ground beef and a melody of finely ground vegetables. He granted me a taste of his dish and it was to die for.   The prices were reasonable for such a high class restaurant. I highly recommend going there if you're in the mood for some incredible authentic Italian cuisine.    - Matthew Stovarsky  Lockkeepers: 8001 Rockside Rd, Cleveland, OH 44125   (6/20/2018)"}
{"text":"Loved it! Organized a 7-person group dinner through OpenTable and all were very pleased. Food was great, great wine list, great desserts by in-house pastry chef, and service was excellent. Portions were excellent. It was nice to get away from the chain restaurants that dominate Independence. We were staying there for a week on business and a waiter at Outback recommended it. So happy he did!  The bolognese sauce was very good on my ravioli. My coworkers had the pumpkin ravioli, the lasagna and the chicken picatta. I had mascarpone cheesecake for dessert and it was excellent.  Great wine suggestions from our server. We had a primary server but all the others around us pitched in so that nothing fell through the cracks. Great atmosphere. Also, even though we were surrounded by people (dining room was full), we were able to hear eachother well.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The bone in ribeye is to die for. Great service. Beautiful decor. Upscale crowd. Great drinks."}
{"text":"Nice outside patios reminiscent of lazy days down south with outside ceiling fans and decor.  Food great.  Staff very knowledgable.  Good time."}
{"text":"I just loved this place.  I was in the company of loved ones who live nearby, and this was a wonderful experience.   I had a perfectly presented proseco in along stemmed beautiful glass.  When the bread came I could smell it approaching the table.  My cousins both had the fontina prosciutto stuffed long boned pork chop which I was immediately jealous I did not order.  But then I took a bite of my veal parm on the long bone.  I almost did not need a fork.  Better than old school veal parm,  modern veal parm cooked perfectly and oh so tender.    I chose to get some of the nightly special, homemade ravioli.  I could finish only a quarter of my huge plate.  I was determined to try the most decadent and moist flourless choc cake, and was wild for the affogato espresso I pored over vanilla bean gelato.   Our waitress, Jackie did not skip a beat.  She is a 10.  If you go ask for her.  The next day my cousin and I read about the  Venetian executive chef, quite accomplished, and both the pastry chef and the chef d' cuisine.  They know how to please and it was clear to me they were very serious about what came out of the back of the house.  The ambiance, the dim lighting, and the charm of the story of the locks makes me, a Los Angelean, want to go back in the summer and lunch on th patio.  This is a gem in the Cleveland surrounds."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this restaurant for work meetings and am surprised I've never written a review before now. I visited on 12/19/16 for our company's holiday lunch. Service was terrific as usual. For the first time ever, I had dietary restrictions that I needed some assistance with. I told me server and she was terrific at communicating with me on my best options. The meal was prepared wonderfully and very light so I could enjoy it. I had the surf and turf with steamed carrots and loved it. In addition, their bread, butter and tapenade are terrific too. And my usual go to meal is the pronto which is soup, salad and an entree served together. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Lockkeepers had long been on my list of classy joints to check out since moving to CLE and now I can't believe I hadn't gone here sooner!        You know you're in for a great experience when you roll up and complimentary valet is offered - I was digging the place already.  Definitely a nice touch in Northeast Ohio during the winter.        The interior itself was very cool and classy too - the entire place looked nice but we chose to hang out in the lounge as my fiancèe and I were just in for appetizers and drinks before going out on NYE.  The lounge was very inviting and we got seated in a comfy corner with a view of the large bar.      Our waitress was nice and very informative, listing off a variety of wonderful sounding entrèes.  She was also very helpful in helping us decide on which of the delicious sounding appetizers to split - seriously, it was hard, but the meatballs and polenta were calling my name.      Now, one of my own cooking specialties is a gourmet version of spaghetti and meatballs so I'm critical of the dish when I get it out.  However, these were the.Best.Meatballs.I.Have.Ever.Had. For Real, it was like Italy in mouth.  People describe ribs as fall off the bone or chicken piccatta as melt in your mouth, but both of these were amalgamated when I tasted the meatballs. Amazing.  The polenta and sauce served as an interesting and delicious accent to the main dish.       The drinks we ordered were also very delicious, a nice balance of sweet for her and strong for my lemoncello whiskey combo.       We did have a really sad part to our Lockkeepers experience, though: we only had time for appetizers and left sad that we didn't have time for more food.  That being said, we're already planning our return to feast here and try more of the amazing dishes."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered the door until the time we left... The service was excellent! The food was truly amazing! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with my girlfriend. It is upscale for sure and we definitely were not dressed for it but they made us feel comfortable. We got a salad to start and had them split it at no up charge. It was very good and a nice portion. I had the strip steak it was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. My girlfriend got the seafood risotto and it was very good as well. It had lobster and shrimp and was a big porton. The feel of the restaurant was very mellow with a good feel. The patio was nice but we could not get on it. This place is definitely worth a shot. It's a bit on the pricey side but I felt It was worth it."}
{"text":"If you want to take your parents out for dinner, this is the place.  The food ranges from OK to good.  Nothing on the menu is particularly challenging.  The atmosphere in attractive and relaxed.  The service is fantastic.  We started dinner with a cocktail and some bread.  The cocktail glass was sticky-- ew.  But the bread was warm, fresh and crusty with a wonderful tapenade-- salty and savory.  We had the house calamari as an appetizer.  It was your basic fried, breaded calamari tossed with some of the tapenade, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms.  I liked this twist on the same old fried calamari!    I had the saltimboca pork chops.  You would think that pork chops covered in prosciutto and stuffed with cheese would be really juicy.  Not so much.  The prosciutto was completely dried out and the chop was very well done.  Not bad tasting, just a bit overcooked.  It was served with baby vegetables-- nicely crisp tender-- and a square of deep fried risotto-- really good.    My dining companions had the seafood risotto and the salmon-- pronounced very good.  They accommodated my daughter by offering a bowl of pasta with butter and cheese.  Second graders love that sort of thing.    The deserts were boring.  Our tiramisu wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly good, just sort of there. My daughter actually left half her sundae.  Wow!  The service, however, was really outstanding. Our waiter was friendly  but not intrusive.  He was a real professional-- there when you needed him, politely at a distance when you did not.  The serving staff and the bussers were also polite and unobtrusive.  I would give the staff 5 stars!  I really appreciated the waiter giving the price of each special.  He also gave the approximate number of ounces of seafood or meat in each dish.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Yes, as the 5 stars indicate - it's AS GOOD AS IT GETS! We had an OUTSTANDING lunch there as part of our anniversary celebration. They made us feel like we were celebrities! More importantly, the bass was cooked perfectly!! My husband and I couldn't talk while we were enjoying the bass - because we needed those moments to let the flavor take over. He said he didn't want to eat too quickly because then the bass would be gone! It melted in our mouths. Thank you for knowing how to treat your customers and how to cook seafood!"}
{"text":"This is usually our go to after an outing on the train. We've worked our way through the menu and found some favorites in the pasta (which is made fresh) and the sauces that accompany many of the entrees.   First I would suggest a reservation as sometimes there is no wait, and other times they are filled with special occasions. We actually first discovered this place for my Dad's birthday, so it does have a charm for a group outing to celebrate.   We tend to lean a bit more towards the Italian offerings at this place as the pasta has never disappointed and the appetizers have always been a great way to start the meal with some excellent flavors. The meatballs and antipasto board are our usual go to. For entrees, if you're a pasta fan, do yourself a favor and order from that section. The more traditional entrees work really well with the pairings of sauce they tend to have accompanied. We could take or leave the tuna as it was more well done than I would prefer, but the salsa was a nice touch. Otherwise, the rest of the entrees worked really well together and had us coming back.  Make sure to read the descriptions. The staff is very friendly so if there is something you're unfamiliar with and not sure if you should try, ask some questions."}
{"text":"Incredible service! The staff was very friendly and attentive. They even decant your wine."}
{"text":"From the time we were greeted from the valet till the time we exited, it was exceptional service. Very warm and friendly staff in a very warm and charming ambiance. Our server was on point and very friendly. Food was served hot and delicious. Large portions, I had to take half of mine home for a second meal. I ordered the simple greens salad. It was a large portion so our server split to share. It was delicious, spring mix with cucumber, carrot and the balsamic dressing was very good, and just the right amount to taste. My main course was the Seafood Fra Diavolo, huge. Again as stated spicy, just enough to taste, but not overbearing. There was a very good mixture of the seafood, proportioned well with the spaghetti. We were full, but splurge and ordered a cannoli to go. It was packed nicely in a box with a side of chocolate. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place.  I recommend the Bone in Chop."}
{"text":"Last night we enjoyed really good food and fantastic service here. I can't emphasize enough how great the service was. Everybody was attentive and personable. It's incredibly rare to have this level of service even if you're a regular, which we certainly aren't.   Our meal included the lasagna and walleyeas well as the meatball appetizer. All were quite good.   The new building - new to me, built around 2002 - was nice but tasteful. The view of the creek was excellent and made for an enjoyable dinner.  Please visit this place and enjoy it."}
{"text":"My grandparents or clients would really like this place.  I thought it was okay, but a little too old school for what I was hoping for and boy what a contrast from this, again perfectly acceptable nice place and lolita which I had the pleasure of going on Tuesday after a Monday visit here.  I was here last Monday and a few business associates had arranged for the sommelier room at this restaurant a couple miles away from the hotel.  The first impression is very good with a nice guy and a complimentary valet, however don't really know why this is necessary given the ample parking below.  The space itself is actually quite beautiful with warm lighting, high ceilings and white table cloths.  The servers are dressed iup and all seem quite professional.  I'll tell you what struck me most about the place was the beautiful ornate woodwork.  We were seated in the sommelier room with about 8 of us at a large (oak?) table I'd guess.  The wine room was directly behind our private dining room and again the general atmosphere was quite nice and relaxing.  The meal started with some perfectly acceptable bread served with a nice dipping oil.  The waiter was happy to make ame a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives on the rocks and the wine selection was pretty ample and reasonably priced.  I don't really eat salads and so he suggested the vegetarian bean soup of some kind.  I didn't think I was going to like it, but the flavor was actually quite good.  The only miss was the soup was luke warm.  I then had the lamb chops as the entree which were served with a very nice crust and a healthy portion.  The temperature was a little off, but not enough to mess up the lamb.  The risotto that accompanied was very rich and for me a bit of a miss.  I'm not italitan and probably have no idea what good risotto is.  I just know what I like.  Others had the scallopini, salmon and steaks.  I didn't hear any negative comments about the place.  Again, this is a pretty good spot, but not necessarily where I would want to go often or go to eat at the bar.  It's probably great for weddings and business functions and has a little above average food in a nice atmosphere with good service."}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was perfect with recommendations but still we're not hovering over you. I loved the use of truffle oil! Broccolini was on a special and it was the best i have ever had! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Cleveland for work, I had a delightful dinner at Lockkeepers! This fine dining restaurant has been serving up sophisticated, gourmet Italian-American dishes and cocktails for 25 years. There is no question why Lockkeepers continues to be one of the best restaurants in Cleveland.   First off, this restaurant offers a unique dining experience. Nestled in the Cuyahoga Valley, Lockkeepers is located in a stunning arts and crafts style building. Elegantly appointed with mahogany millwork its soaring floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Ohio and Erie Canal. In the summertime, patrons have the option to dine outside in candlelight.    Secondly, Lockkeepers offers an extensive menu. Venetian born Chef, Alberto Leandri, showcases his culinary artistry with fine Italian cuisine, fresh pastas, steaks and seafood. Each dish is made from the freshest seasonal ingredients, and all the pasta and gelato is homemade. Lockkeepers even has a special menu for each season. Portions are generous and affordable.   When I dined here, I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon. The salmon came with black fregula, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, spinach and basil pesto. The dish was healthy yet flavorful. For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Budino. It was AMAZING! One of the best desserts I have had at an Italian restaurant.   There is no doubt Lockkeepers will continue to stick around for another 25 years. Delicious food, wonderful menu and romantic atmosphere make Lockkeepers a true keeper of the Cleveland Foodies!"}
{"text":"What started as coming for special occasions became.. let's go for the wonderdul wine list. The appetizers are so delicious. Polenta and fresh meatballs  they were so wonderdul to put on separate plates.  The bread is homemade and aromatic and the butter just melts they also bring oil  and kind and bring more. We love the wine list we chose a wonderful Malbec   the entire table enjoyed their entrées . We have yet to have room for dessert and look forward to warm weather so we can enjoy sitting outside."}
{"text":"I don't know what the big fuss is. My wife and I went to the Cleveland Symphony on 12/14/2015, we wanted to go to a nice restaurant before the performance. I had a veal chop that they breaded and left on the bone, and my wife had their wild mushroom gnocchi. Both were ok, their pasta sauce is bland. We had the board with cured meats and cheese on it and it was ok as well. The kicker was we did not have drinks, just water but had dessert (which was the best part of dinner) and still dropped $100. To us, it was overpriced and so so so not worth another trip. Go to Melt, your better off."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for a date night. We had a gift certificate that we won at a raffle. We walked in and I was impressed by the rich decor. The vibe was warm and inviting. Be aware when you get there that the close parking is mostly reserved for a different restaurant, but complimentary valet is available which is really nice. We had a reservation and we were seated right away. The service was great throughout dinner.  We ordered a couple of specials from the menu that night. We started with an arugala salad with a nice portion of buffalo mozzarella. We split the salad so they halved it and brought it out on two plates which was nice. The salad was very tasty, a nice starter.  For the main course I had a special which I would NEVER have ordered had I not had a gift certificate. $55 for a pasta dish with mushrooms. The kicker is that it had imported truffles from Italy shaved on top. I basically ordered it necessary l because I wanted to be able to say I've had truffles from Italy! The dish was prefect. Earthy and rich but not overly done. The truffle wasn't too overwhelming and played nicely with the rest of the mushroom flavor.  My husband had the black garlic gnocchi off of the regular menu. This dish was stellar. The leek/cream sauce paired so well with the gnocchi. And the dish was just so pretty! The lobster was perfectly cooked and added a bright richness to the plate.  Anyway, if you couldn't tell already, we loved this dinner and I cannot believe this is the first time we'd been there.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars vs. 5 is that the desert menu seemed lacking. It's very rare that I go for a nice dinner and don't want something on the dessert menu. However, since the dinner was so great, I'll definitely be back anyway. We want to try something from the steak menu next time."}
{"text":"My love and I came here tonight to celebrate and had an incredible evening starting the moment we walked in the door. Everyone worked together as a staff seamlessly to make our evening memorable and beyond enjoyable.  The food was excellent and the ambiance set the mood perfectly. If you have an evening to celebrate, there would be no better choice !"}
{"text":"I made reservations here to celebrate my doctoral degree. The service was fantastic. Would recommend the lobster ravioli and lasagna."}
