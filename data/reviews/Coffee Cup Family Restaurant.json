{"text":"Love this little place.  I have been coming here my whole life it seems.  The food is always good and hot and fast.  The service is excellent. And the prices are perfect."}
{"text":"It's ok, typical mom and pop diner.   If you are looking for comfort food this is a good place to go.
Service is usually pretty good there, but there is one waitress who seems to have a permanently pissy attitude, which gives one strike against the place in my book."}
{"text":"Great heart-stopping fare. Really tasty but bring a defibrulator. Smarmy waitress as per usual. Great value though! Stop in!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has the feel of a family owned neighborhood restaurant.  They had a large party when we walked in, so service was a bit slow at first.  Now, since the name of this place is \"Coffee Cup\", I expected the coffee to be better than normal. Well, turns out, it's just a name.  It wasn't awful, but I guess I expected better.  The wallpaper even has pictures of cups of coffee on it.  

I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs and toast and it was hot and tasty.  I could not tell if the hash was homemade or not, but it was good.  I left with the intention of returning to try other things on the menu.  I noticed a waiter carrying an order of pancakes and each one was almost the diameter of the plate. I'll be trying those on another trip.

4/6/2013 Update
You know...I've been here twice mainly due to proximity and the need for something fairly quick. Each time I expect to be disappointed, but honestly, I have been satisfied each time. Nothing special for sure, but I think that's what adds to the charm of the place. I am assuming, but I imagine the older gentlemen enjoying their coffee and breakfast are regulars and from the surrounding Bedford neighborhood. I had grits and sausage and it was great. The grits were cooked perfectly...creamy, buttery and hot. Yes, grits. Again, nothing fancy...they don't do shrimp and grits or grits and gravy (at least I don't think so) or any other variation that you might see at a more upscale restaurant.  Nonetheless, I'm increasing the rating up to 4 from 3.  I still think their coffee should absolutely blow you away though....meh."}
{"text":"Local diner. Great coffee decor that gives this a sweet small town feel. They just added more burger options beyond the plane Jane staple. Coffee cup is my choice for a weekend meal"}
{"text":"Great home cooked food if you are NOT in any hurry to go about your day.  We finally had to ask for our order to be taken (sitting at the counting in front of 3-4 servers). Refilled our own coffee ....
Waited an hour for our breakfast.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Mom and Pop restaurants are a favorite of mine. 

They don't get more \"Small Town\" than the Coffee Cup. It's on the main drag in old Bedford and I went on a whim. The food was good, no frills but tasty and good, and the service was really good too.  What I was struck by was the nice, homey atmosphere and the interesting folks just hanging out. It felt like a place for conversation and quiet Sunday mornings. 

Lots of parking out back and front, prices were good and the folks that run it reminded me of my grandparents. Good place:)

So, if you want a place that fills you up, stop off, and try the Coffee Cup:)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years this time I wanted something different I got this so called corned beef hash If you enjoy potatoes onion and chopped beef this is your dish but it is not hash worst dish I ever had here. And the waitress didn't seem to care! How sad"}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant and the decor amiable when my wife and I visited this family restaurant yesterday. It's always a good day, of course, when there's bananas in your pancakes! I got a chuckle out of the saloon doors that led to the hallway where the bathrooms were. We recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times good food...but now I'm done..i can't wait 45 min for a few eggs... for a mom-and-pop Mom and Pop restaurant you would think the people would be friendly in total I think I was there an hour and 15 minutes for two breakfasts"}
{"text":"Cozy little place on Broadway. Stopped in today for a quick bite. Nothing quick here. The hostess took a minute to seat me and then a few more minutes to get me a menu. Then the waitress brought out the menu and took several more minutes to get my order. I was in there a half hour before I got anything to eat. There was hardly anyone in there. 
They feature a good deal of standard American fare dishes, omelettes and the like. Sandwiches, soups, burgers, comfort food. Food was OK and the dining room was tastefully decorated. Presentation was decent. Prices were great. Waitress was thorough and nice. Clean. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or anytime. Good quick food friendly service and a good price. This is cleaner than other local greasy spoons.  But I feel bad calling this place a greasy spoon, it is just a nice little restaurant.  It has been in the same location and under different management for at least 40 plus years."}
{"text":"At first I heard about this place around town it's just called The \"CUP\" I was concerned it was going to be a hole in the wall type of joint but I can say I was pleasantly surprised it was a nice, small, mom and pop restaurant with a home type of feel. Every one I encountered was nice and very welcoming and we got to request where we wanted to be seated. 

So the menu items there was very affordable like for example my waffle I ordered was about $5 w/ 2 eggs and turkey links. The breakfast menu is almost similar to a \"Waffle House\" but with more options! I saw the menu had a dinner and dessert selection as well. I was presently surprised overall! I would like to come visit again the next time I come back up this way. I love any place where I can get more for my money."}
{"text":"today I had the worst burger I have ever had in my life at The Coffee Cup today.  The waitress was totally unfriendly and the food was horrible, I have been there before and it was always just so so, but I will never go back !"}
{"text":"Upon first entering we got menus, we weren't given a child's menu so I ordered the only kid friendly item on the menu, grilled cheese ($3) I asked if it came with fries and the waitress said yes. We ordered the rest of our food (2 $5 items)
We ordered 2 drinks, coffee & Coke. It took a ridiculously long amount of time before our food even arrived, 45 mins when it was empty in the restaurant. When it finally arrived the table behind us (who arrived 20 mins after we arrived) got their food right after us. It was ok, nothing special. When we received the bill it was double what we expected because the waitress had said yes fries were included but they weren't. I wouldn't recommend this place even before the doubling of the bill for fries.
The waitress wasn't friendly at all and never checked on us."}
{"text":"Coffee Cup is a decent little restaurant.  It does have a hometown feel and look as soon as you enter.  There is plenty of seating as you can sit at the counter like an old fashioned diner or sit in the booths so it is very cozy yet roomy in Coffee Cup.  I work night shift and stopping in here in the morning is a delight.  It is called \"Coffee Cup\" so getting a cup of coffee in the morning here is an obvious choice.  The coffee is decent to (I give it 3/5 stars).  The coffee though is what starts you off when you look at a decently priced menu with daily specials and several choices!  I LOVE their pierogies as an appetizer!  My roommate always enjoys their French Onion soup but it is salty for those who are concerned with sodium as their menu contains several items for \"salt lovers\"  but hey, the food is more than decent and it does depend on what you order too!  Their fish items are delicious as my roommate and I ordered those one visit earlier.  We each tried the others dish and were pleasantly surprised (4/5 overall for food and menu choices).  Prices are cheap (5/5 there).  Our bill is usually around $30 with coffee, appetizers and main dishes.  Wait time can be an issue but it does depend on TWO things.  ONE; how many people are dining. TWO; (MOST IMPORTANT) how many people are working.  There is one waitress in there that always looks upset but if you notice the waitresses here DO IT ALL!  The waitresses here greet you, seat you, get you started, take your order, get your drinks/food and refills, watch/maintain the diner counters and customers while watching/maintaining the other tables and finally they check you out at the register.  If there is only two people working inside the restaurant then wait time will be much longer.  Also, (it's not great customer service but it is understandable) the employees can look/seem a bit snarky but that's because they have so much to do (NOT an excuse but a reason for some of their responses so early in the morning).  Overall, this is a great little place to try in the morning and especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Only got sandwiches here and that is what the review is for.

Pretty large portions for price (like nearly double what I expect). Can't comment on anything else but I enjoyed them. Guess it would depend on what you order though"}
{"text":"We will be back.  They offer about 5-6 various breakfast choices that offer a great variety and they are all under $5.00.  What a great place to eat.  Family feel with great knowledge of their menu.  Our server didn't even write down our orders and she nailed the whole thing (6 of us in the group).  We will be back.  Food was good.  Generous portions.  What a wonderful down home place to just go get breakfast.  If in the area it is a great place to grab a cheap breakfast that packs a punch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Very reasonable price for a tasty meal of eggs and home fries.    Waitstaff was over the top friendly.   I will definitely come back!"}
