{"text":"Where to start...Lacrosse tournament in town on night 1. Zero control of noise post 11pm. Number 2, thought I would use your dry cleaning. Slip says in by 8am out by 7pm. 7 pm return became 8:30pm and you didn't have my suit. Promised it would be there in the morning. No suit. Promised I'd have it that night (thanks but the meeting was over but we all had a good laugh at your failure). Finally got the suit, found it on the floor of my room! Picked it up and the pants weeny hung and you wrinkled it again by putting it on the floor..

So that's bad but the room cleanup also was bad. The remote fell off the bedside table and sat on the floor for 4 days. Sure I could have picked it up but it became a battle between me vs your cleaning team. I guess the floor is preferred place for things. 

The adjustable firmness mattress is another fail. The room attendants move the setting back to regular and once you change it the bed becomes a lopsided mess. Just supply a regular mattress please. Your option sounds fun but doesn't work.

This has become a substandard hotel that only thrives due to few options in the area. Sure you'll get business at this property but in larger cities with more options you'll not be a favorite."}
{"text":"What made me happy: modern looking, healthy snacks for purchase in lobby 24/7. Great a/c. Lots of parking. 

What made me unhappy: room is understocked in every category. Needed 2 more towels, pillows, and no glassware. Front desk kid had some stank in his voice. Not rude but, a I talk in script and don't bug me stank. 
The whole experience was average at best."}
{"text":"Excellent modern and clean rooms with brand new LG HD TV's.   I've been here several times now and always had a great night's rest.   Nice bar and restaurant which serves great original menu choices and offers a superb breakfast with great coffee and espresso available.   Finally, you get four-star hotel features and friendly service at two-star prices, this place is a tremendous value."}
{"text":"We tend to stay at Hiltons a lot when traveling for business. This Hilton is a solid bet - clean, modern rooms. I'm especially impressed by the happy, attentive servers at the restaurant/bar. I mean, really, they don't have to be so pleasant & caring, but they are, & it makes a difference. Best feature? Keurig coffee in each room and comfortable beds. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've stayed here a few times on business trips, and most of the time this Hilton Garden Inn is pretty unremarkable - decent chain place, nothing too nice or too dingy.

This last time I had an above-average experience - after coming back from dinner the hotel's Wifi network was down, which is a giant problem for Internet addicts like - well, any of us nowadays. I went down to the front desk expecting a dismissive response from them, but was surprised that the front desk woman seemed genuinely concerned and get tech support on the line right away and even played harball with them on the phone. (Tip if you're staying here and the internet is down - the Ajax convention center across the street has an open network you can easily get on from the bar area.)

So I sit downstairs at the bar for a while and get my drink for free on account of the Internet outage! Brilliant! Cool to see friendly service and people that actually seem to care at a chain hotel.

Another pro tip: if you get the $12.95 breakfast, skip the buffet and order eggs made fresh or the beef brisket + poached egg breakfast. No reason to eat egg beaters if you can have the real thing."}
