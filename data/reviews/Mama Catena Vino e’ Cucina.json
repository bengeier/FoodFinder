{"text":"On a road trip and Yelped for a restaurant with pasta. Stumbled upon this gem! Rita was an AMAZING waitress, the ambiance is AWESOME, and the food was SUPERB! My husband ordered a calzone and said it was the best he's ever had...that's saying tons! I had spaghettini with putanesca and meatballs...to die for! Definitely recommend to anyone stopping through!"}
{"text":"So happy to know that this wonderful establishment will rise again like Arizona's capital from soot! I understand Fran and Rina refused to accept crowdfunding because the insurance covered the damages. Such a testament to their character underlines their devotion to make certain Mama Catena returns as magnificent as it was when we all were there to delight in our superb meals. When they asked how my veal parmiggiana was and I replied \"orgasmic,\" they gave me a small wedge of my favorite cheese to take home (I was staying with my family) and gnosh on for the remainder of the weekend. And it was true Fontina! The one with the eyes, and sharp mushroomy taste! Not the slightly blander, creamy Fontinella counterpart found on this continent.  Bless you Mama Catena. Long may you live!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Mama Catena's for over 20 years, even though they live across town in Parma. I can't believe this place isn't better known. Run by a Sicilian immigrant and his family, the food is homemade, fresh and flavorful.   The involtini is my new favorite, but ask the staff for recommendations. They've never steered me wrong. As it's such a small place, you may well be talking to one of the cooks or to the grandfather who originally opened this place. You can see the love that goes into the food.  I am addicted with the lemon torte, which rivals the tortes I had when living in Europe. The cannoli have the right texture outside, creaminess inside, without being overly sweet. Heaven."}
{"text":"I signed up for a yelp account specifically to write a review for Mama Catena because it was that good and because I've searched for 3 years to find good italian food near Cleveland.  How good?  It was better than the tasting menu at Babbo in NYC, Mario Batali's restaurant.  This is as good as Italian food gets, outside of someone's actual home in Italy.  The owners and cooks are first generation Sicilians and cook with the same recipes and attention to detail that they do at home.  In addition to their soul-warming food, they also have the warmth in welcoming you that makes you feel like you're getting a home-cooked meal.  My fiance ordered the linguine in baby clams sauce, and I had the spaghettini in meat sauce with meatballs.  Hers was so amazing that it almost made me regret my own choice, even though mine was already one of the best meat sauces I've had in years.  The briny savoriness of the seafood was incredible.  Both our portions were also very generous for the price.  I don't usually write reviews because honestly, very few places are memorable enough that I feel it is worth my time to write a review.  Mama Catena was one of the top 10 meals in my life, and we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York City - wish this place were closer. Fantastic meal, wonderful people. Wow!"}
{"text":"Truly excellent food and overall experience.  The family operators are attentive and personable and personally engaged in your enjoyment of the restaurant.  Pasta options are many and uniformly high quality.  Pizza is very good, as is the pepperoni bread, as is the cannoli, and the regular table garlic bread.  Usually crowded, worth the trip to Euclid, no question.  Must check it out!"}
{"text":"I took my wife and son there for the first and last time. Aside from our server being nice and on top of her game, the food was not what I expected. We started off with the calamari which came to our table with a strong fishy smell. The calamari was saugy and full of old oil from the deep fryer. There were little black burnt pieces of breading and oil on the bottom of our plate. Maybe try changing the oil occassionally. My son ordered a pizza which he enjoyed but I didnt care for either. My wife ordered the stuffed lobster ravioli but they did not have any available so she ordered the stuffed spinich and ricotta ravioli which was ok, nothing special. I had the saltimboca (veal) and it was overcooked and too salty however the pasta was good. Overall experience was negative and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"My first meal here will not be my last. The amount of flavor in each dish is unbelievable. The pizza was among the best I've ever had. I couldn't stop thinking about it. The staff is very nice and friendly. The atmosphere is lovely. The escargot was delicious and the involtini was a treat. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After a couple of hard weeks, my husband decided we needed a dinner date. While heading to Little Italy...always a fabulous meal, I suggested we try something new based on a sweet friend's recommendation. Mama Catena's is quite small with seating for less than 50 but provides an atmosphere of warmth, love and family. The entrees are fantastic...fresh selections and generous portions. The owner ventured over to our table towards the end of our meal and shared a \"blind tasting\" dinner option that we plan to experience with a group of family members. This place is a gem. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh Italian food. We did the blind menu, and every dish was a delicious surprise. Wine pairings were spot on. Save yourself time and money and don't bother driving to Little Italy. This place beats them all, and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet and probably the friendliest family I have ever encountered in a family owned place. Rolled in looking for a hangover fix (nothing like lovin from the pizza oven), and wasn't disappointed. Met 4 generations of the family that afternnon,  had some fun, and some great food.  Great pasta, nice sauces and the homemade bread was just to die for. I'm a sucker for good italian, and I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here and were very impressed with the menu. Their wine by the glass selection is lacking with only one red wine and the Pinot Grigio I had tasted like the bottle had been open a while, but it was still drinkable (then again what wine isn't?). The bread was out of this world. Our appetizer was good, as were our pastas. However, like Danial B said, the chicken I got in my pasta was similar to Tyson frozen pink slime chicken. When I'm paying an extra $3.50 for chicken, I expect it to be edible. I wouldn't feed the chicken they served me to my dogs. We decided maybe they just don't sell a lot of chicken and still raved over the rest of our meal. At the end, the server offered us dessert and I asked if they had tiramisu. She said they did and we got some to go. Since this restaurant prides themselves on heritage I thought it would be good. When we got home we put it on the counter and about twenty minutes later got around to eating it. It was frozen. There was a small puddle of water in the to go container where it had started thawing out. They shouldn't have even sold it to us. We will go back, but we will stick with spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"Hospital stay at Euclid CCF. My wonderful wife made the run and brought back fantastic, flavorful pizza. Not to be missed"}
{"text":"Had such an amazing dinning experience. The atmosphere, Staff, and owners made you feel like you are family. Like legit. Food was great, wine list amazing, overall highly satisfied."}
{"text":"Euclid's best Italian Ristorante, Mama Catena's, is open again as of May 2018, and if you are new to MC's just know they can go noodle to noodle, bottle to bottle, calzone to calzone with any place in Little Italy and win.    I grew up around the corner from Mama Catena's and lived off their pizza and calzones as a little bambino.  As I got older I would gradually try more menu items and not long after that I fell in love with their Involtini pasta, which is cheese filled pasta rolled into a log then cut into large pin wheels.  I have never found anything similar to it. The involtini, lasagna with meat sauce, and gnocchi are some of MC's specialty pastas but they have a build your own pasta section that has every noodle and sauce you could imagine to make it your way. One unique sauce Mama Catena's offers is a blend of marinara and Alfredo called Rosella sauce, and I promise you it is worth a try.  I stick to the classic veal and chicken parm entrees and they are consistently delicious and give you the chance to try any of the pastas with it, but MC has a ton of authentic Italian entree's that I am just not adventurous enough to try.  You could come here every day for 3 months and try something new each time. Everything from steak, sausage and pork chop to salmon, shrimp and eggplant.  There are plenty of vegetarian options and tasty salads as well.   If you are a wino, Mama Catena's has one of the best wine lists in the great Cleveland area.  It is huge, diverse, and their sommelier can tell you anything you want to know about each bottle, including cool stories about their background. Wine flights and corking services are available.  My family and my community are so excited and relieved to have Mama Catena's back following their temporary closure from a fire. They are a true Mom and Pop, family owned restaurant serving up the most genuine Italian food and LOVE you can find.  Show them love back and support them as they make their return."}
{"text":"Pros: I didn't get sick or anything like that.   Cons: very small....not in an positive intimate kinda way though, rather in a way where you can smell the neighboring tables deodorant choices kinda way. The food was barely ok and very expensive. The chicken was not real chicken but mechanically processed bloop like at McDonald's....that in itself should be enough to make any foody irate...  I think their bread is fantastic and their pizza most likely echoes that, but otherwise, the food was overpriced and lazy."}
{"text":"Great homemade Italian food. The pizza and pasta were delicious! Was very impressed with the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Been going here for 3 years.  Food is excellent.  Love the fact it's family owned and operated.  We went last night. Ordered the 4 cheese pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, green peppers and mushrooms.  It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"As usual, another great experience here.  Took my niece here for a, \"girls' night\" dinner.  Food was amazing...we tried the pizza tonight.  Very good.  I had to get a side order of meatballs.  3 for $2.50?  Pinch me.  I'm in.  And the bread they serve...that bread!  It is so delicious.  I don't know what they put on it but it's great...and addictive.  They remembered me from when I had my boyfriend's surprise party there.  Fran and Rena were both there and Mama and Papa were on their way out as we walked in.  We are always treated like family and are engaged in conversation about a variety of topics.  At the end of our meal Rena brought out a complimentary plate of fruits and nutella sauce.  What a nice end to our meal.  This place will always hold a special place in my heart and I always look forward to the next time I go."}
{"text":"It's called Mama Catena's  All I can say is WOW. But I will say just a little more.  I'm from SF Bay area where there is no shortage of fantastic Sicilian/Italian food. This place was a step or two above anything I've had from out west. This quaint little unassuming spot will knock your shoes and socks off. Family run with all the love in the world put into the food. I could taste it in every single bite. I started with a hearty risotto soup,  fantastic. Calzone that was so soft and tender, stuffed with pep, sausage and mushroom and a beautiful dish I'd never seen nor heard of called invertelli (I'm probably off on how you say it)? It was ridicules. A rolled pasta with a multitude of different cheeses baked with a velvety red gravy.   I had the pleasure of meeting the family that owns and operates MC's. They are all wonderful people. Sweet as can be - all of them!! Thanks Mama"}
{"text":"I used to spend a fair amount of time out in Euclid on the weekends years back for training seminars. For long, grueling, 10 hours a day training seminars. One of my first days there I asked a local for a good place to hang my coat and to grab a bite. Aside from the typical fast food choices and other selections, one mentioned was \"Mama Catenas.\" Unfortunately, the couple I asked had never formulated a solid opinion of the place. Sounded like an adventure.  I walked inside and was offered a seat in the cozy dining area. It was earlier in the afternoon and I was the sole customer. On the television reruns of \"I Love Lucy\" played on. I noticed they were being watched by an elderly gentleman (\"Papa Catena\") in the booth behind me. I cordially said hello and grabbed my chair.  My first visit was a litmus test. Whenever I go to a new Italian (or Sicilian, in this case) sit down, I generally go with a plain pasta and red. Why? A good, flavorful red sauce paints a vivid picture of everything else on the menu. It's simple and generally requires a certain level of mastery to get it just right. Fran (who I later came to know) knew how to make a good red sauce.  A crisp loaf of bread, refreshing salad with Italian vinaigrette, and my selected pasta later, I knew I was in the right spot. I slowly enjoyed my meal as I sipped black coffee and watched the reruns. From the first day I was greeted warmly and felt like more than a stranger or patron grabbing a meal.  I've spent about a dozen times experimenting off the menu and have grown quite fond of the place. I still remember the extra long lunch breaks I'd take just to hear how \"Mama\" and \"Papa\" (who regularly visit) met back in the old country. On one occasion I had a bottle of Toasted Head with a friend and spent a good deal of time chatting with Fran. Catena's is definitely worth the visit for an early lunch. The hospitality and the flavorful cooking make for a wonderful experience that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"Mama Catena's is the definition of a hidden gem.  It is in a small strip mall and not something that would catch your eye driving by.  A colleague brought me here one day for lunch and I loved everything about it!  I liked that it's a family run restaurant and I'm pretty sure the whole family is always there when I visit for lunch.  It's an awesome place with a lot of character.  To me, the best dish here by far is the involtini (check out Steve R's picture of the involtini).  I recommend getting it half & half with chicken parm, but you may have to ask nicely for it. haha  I also recommend the caprese salad.  They do a classic stacked caprese salad and add a slice of cucumber and drizzle balsamic vinegar on top.  Very tasty!  Overall this place is definitely worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but the food was excellent and the service was spot on! This is a small, family owned Italian restaurant that has generous portions and reasonable prices, both of which are key components that dictate how I perceive an establishment - so I was not disappointed in the very least!  All entrees are served with bread, which is always an added bonus! I would definitely go back, and likely will sometime soon!"}
{"text":"It took more than 20 minutes for anyone to even offer us a beverage.  The calamari was really overdone.  My husband had a \"specialty\" pizza that had no flavor at all.   It was the worst service we have ever experienced at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night with my son. We shared a pesto based pizza with veggies which was delicious. The owner or maybe the owner's son stopped by every table to make sure everything was satisfactory. Place has a mom and pop feel and nice quiet atmosphere. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Quick review as I only had one dish. Went early,  so only 3 tables booked. Warm greeting from owner. Bread was warm, crispy on outside,  soft and seasoned inside  (really good ). House salad super basic, homemade Italian dressing was very good. Marinara sauce was fantastic, great texture, not too sweet.  Meatballs very good too. Homemade pasta tasted very \"doughy\", almost undercooked. My waitress was just ok. Took forever to bring/cash check. Actually had to ask other waitress as mine had disappeared for a while. Based on the sauce, menu and other reviews I will go back and try again."}
{"text":"Wow. What a gem. A business associate asked if we had ever been here, so tonight we stopped over. Amazing food. This is not a chain,  and the strip plaza is a bit odd, but don't   let that get in your way. Family owned and operated and warmth like you were in their home. Pasta is home made, unique dishes, and wonderful wine. Just tell Fran what you like and pure magic will happen. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"No idea what they are doing there. Tried to order a off of the lunch menu and they specifically told me no. So, ended up paying an extra $5 for the dinner portion and I received Penne covered in butter, a strip of bacon cut into 4 pieces, and prob a 4oz piece of chicken. This was accompanied by one of the weakest side salads ive seen and a sesame roll. That for $20 and it didn't even taste as good as I can make for $3 at home in about 10 min. Realistically this dish should have cost about $9. It does fit in nicely with it's location. There are no good Italian places to eat within a 3 mile radius. Drive elsewhere, you'll save time, money, and calories. When I called to place the carryout order not only were they surprised i was ordering something for lunch but multiple items!  They called back for an unknown reason and the first thing she said was \"Please don't hang up on me\" then said \"nevermind\".  PATHETIC!"}
{"text":"Papa Catena greeted us from his chair by the door as we entered on a quiet summer Monday evening with my 91 year old grandma. \"This is Mama and Papa - and that's for real!,\" she said pointing at the photo on the front of the menu as we sat down. My boyfriend said it was great pizza, and I got a delicious cavatelli marinara dinner with a salad. We got regular crust, plain cheese pizza and the meal was just delectable! This place is very tiny and quaint, hidden in the middle of Euclid in a strip mall on Babbitt Rd. Wine was a little pricey so if I lived in the area I might lean toward take out to save some cash but next time I want to go somewhere special out in the burbs I'll definitely think of Mama Catena's."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! From the salad to the wine to the entrée of rigatoni and Italian sausage the service was superb! The bread was warm and seasoned to perfection! I love this new haunt!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian meal I've had in a very long time. The antipasto platter was a great share the table first course, the mortadella was melt in your mouth delicious as was the eggplant tapenade. I got the gnocchi with marinara and meatballs, with chianti. Finished with lemon gelato would come again in a heartbeat and probably do the blind tasting!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation. Mama Catena's is popular - and for a reason. Delicious dishes - homemade pastas, family recipe sauces and recipes -- family-operated -- at reasonable prices.  On a busy night, I did take-out to ensure I could savor the flavors. Homemade calvetini pasta in marinara sauce with meatballs and a dinner salad. There is nothing like fresh and homemade pasta -- tender, melts in your mouth goodness on a fork. The sauce was tasty --next time I'm getting on pepper flakes for that kick. Hit the stop and oh so delicious.  Will be back for the pizza and other homemade pasta selections."}
{"text":"I've never seen more charm and character packed into a small space without it becoming overdone and cheesy but, this has been pulled off expertly at Mama Catena. In spite of the dark, romantic, and attractive atmosphere there's an instant feeling of warmth and family once your greeted.    Our server Hope was warm, knowledgeable, helpful, and perfectly attentive. The feeling of family comes from the fact that the majority of the staff is indeed family and they make you feel like you belong in theirs. This is evident in several of them either saying hello or making sure you have everything you need (and not because your server is slacking mind you). This is done with genuine concern for your experience and without being intrusive.    Now... Last but, certainly not least the food. Well, we started with the calamari appetizer and it comes lightly breaded and fried perfectly crisp along with the excellent house marinara for dipping. It had to be best calamari I've had. Next we got our salads. The salads while not anything original were fresh and crisp with an excellent house Italian dressing. The bread was rather unique. It appeared to be wedges of pizza dough drizzled with butter, olive oil, and of course seasoned with garlic. It was just ever so slightly crunchy and very tasty. Our entrees were fabulous. I had the Saltimbocca a la cesca, a veal dish that was lightly breaded and pan fried. Two pieces of such were layered with soprezzata which seemed to me to be another kind of Italian ham. On the side was a ribbon-esque pasta in a sauce that was a combo of the marinara and alfredo. It was topped with what appeared to be a grated toasted cheese that was awesome. The whole dish was incredible. My wife had the involtini which was a blend of Italian cheese rolled in sheets of pasta then sliced into pin-wheels. The \"pin-wheels\" were served over the marinara. This dish although simple in execution was excellent as well.    We're not wine drinkers so, we did not partake in the selections. We did however have dessert. One was a house special parfait type thing. It has fresh berries, pieces of cake, cream, and berry sauce. Wow! The second is the lemon torte which is also fantastic.   In closing all I can say is I cannot wait to get back there and try more of the impressive menu. ."}
{"text":"This is not just an amazing culinary experience, but also a trip to rich Italian culture and an invitation into an amazing family!   Mama Catena's stands as some of the best Italian food I've ever had - without question.  I ordered the eggplant rollatini - which came with homemade pasta and a delicious red sauce.  The eggplant was amazing - perfectly breaded, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside.   Also, it was enough to feed a small family of four - great to have leftovers! The meal comes with a salad, and I highly recommend their homemade Italian dressing.  The family who owns this spot is truly an amazing bunch.  We started chatting with them, and they were more than happy to entertain us with the history of the restaurant, their lives and travels, their family history in Sicily, as well as what inspires them to cook the amazing dishes they create each day.    In the corner booth, you'll see the matriarch sitting below a photo of her as a young girl in Sicily, enjoying the atmosphere and popping up every one and a while to help in the kitchen or visit with customers.  Next to her is her husband, who she met as a child.  They lived in the same village in Sicily and have been together ever since.  Two of the daughters run the spot, and could not be friendlier.  We shared some stories and gabbed with them over delicious dessert and coffee (the homemade cannoli's are HEAVEN!)  Two hours later, we had made new friends who I'm am very happy to go and visit again.  Hugs and emails were exchanged, and I'll be contacting them soon to set up a wine and food evening for friends!   Great food, new friends, and delicious wine - that's a trifecta in my book!  **Make a reservation - this place only seats 30, but the intimate atmosphere is what makes it feel like you're in their house, enjoying dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Wow. I am so glad that I found this place! Stopped for lunch and everything was amazing. The ice tea was fresh, they baked the amazing bread to order and it was so good. Got the pasta lunch with Alfredo, shrimp,  and broccoli! It came with an amazing salad and I got a delicious creamy Italian dressing with it. Finished off with an espresso! The family was here and the conversations were lovely! The service was phenomenal.  I will definitely be back often"}
{"text":"Welp Yelp, this place is legit.  When you park at the strip mall, it appears unimpressive from the outside.  But wait - there's a treasure trove of taste awaiting through those doors.   We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress Rina (ask for her - she's always there) ran through our questions that we had about the menu, which is largely in Italian words none of us really understood. Of course everything was proclaimed to be delicious, in typical Italian fashion.   After ordering, we were brought a delicious basket of bread. And this is the kind of bread that you remember and go back to a place to get again. I could literally see my friends eyes roll into the back of their heads from tasty bliss.  It was a kind of bread I can't pronounce, drizzled in olive oil with slight hints of garlic.  Rina then brought us a mini-cup of lasagna soup to sample. It too was delicious. I wish I would have had some more of that bread to soak up the soup that my spoon couldn't reach, but alas, I inhaled the bread too soon.  The salad that came with my sandwich was nothing too spectacular, but it was good enough that the plate was cleared.  I guess that says something in itself.  The sandwich - the Focaccia - was delicious. This pesto aioli that came with it was awesome. It was a little on the small side, but when I finished it I wasn't too full... and that's a good thing when you  have to return to work.  One thing about the atmosphere that I found kind of odd.  They had a TV with a screen-saver like floating fish, and it played elevator music on repeat the whole time.  That was their background music there - by the end of the meal, I was a slightly annoyed with that tune.    The prices were on the high side, but the food is worth it.  The floorplan is small and intimate which makes Mama Catena's very date-night-worthy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem.  The atmosphere inside is welcoming, quiet and could be very intimate if you were there for a romantic date.  No stuffy or uptight waiters here.  The family members do everything and if you want to talk to them, they are all very friendly.  We ordered the antipasta plate which was fantastic and such generous portions.  For our main course, the Involtini, Sausage and peppers, Veal Saltimbocca and Pancetta wrapped shrimp.  We all shared and each and every dish was absolutely perfect.  No heavy, Amercainized Italian here.  We will most certainly return with all of our friends.  This is the BEST Italian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"What a great dinner I had! There were multiple gluten free options, and the staff knew what they were talking about. The meat sauce was amazing over the zucchini \"noodles,\" and the meatballs were gluten free as well.  The other folks I ate with each had a different dish, and all meals received high praise."}
{"text":"I got the Capricciosa Pizza (cremini mushrooms, eggplant, prosciutto, truffle oil, basil and burrata cheese). It was very flavorfull. Just, a tad expensive for the size. Service was fast and friendly (I got a free tea while waiting). Wish they had bread sticks... Thank you!"}
{"text":"Mama Catena's is a very wonderful Italian restaurant with fresh ingredients and superb fresh pastas with perfect sauces to pair along with them. I am very happy that they reopened and are still in the Euclid neighborhood. Mama Catena's definitely is just as great if not better than any restaurant in little Italy."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in Cleveland.  Fran and mama and papa are gems, you always feel welcome.  A cozy little place with great choices, Fran is always dreaming up something new for the menu."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the staff!  What a great place a regular for our family!!! You would never expect such a gem in such an unassuming strip mall. Honestly I would tell you not to go here only to keep you from taking our table!"}
{"text":"Just wonderful. The service is fun-loving and friendly, the room inviting, and the food...possibly the best Italian in Cleveland. My bucatini was cooked to perfection and topped with a rich pomodoro sauce. An outstanding find in an unassuming strip center. Standing ovation."}
{"text":"Don't let the modest location (a shopping strip in Euclid) fool you: this place is the real deal. Mom and Pop were both born in Italy. NOT Little Italy...the one across the pond. Their pastas and calzones and salads and meatballs are off-the-charts delicious. I've probably had 2 dozen meals here, and never had a mediocre one. Proof you don't have to go to Murray Hill to get some great Italian food."}
{"text":"I love a good mom and pop place. This place is true Italian family and they treat you like family there also. The owners run the front and even come to talk to their patrons. Seemed like the pizza is a popular item, saw a lot pies being ordered for take out.  I think great sauce is what defines the success of the restaurant, and their sauce is outstanding. I ordered a second helping of sauce because I wanted a nice mouthful with each bite of my chicken parmigiana. Sauce was perfect texture (not too thin like some places), had perfect chemistry of light sweet and even a little spice. Chicken was moist and tender. Very generous portions made for a nice lunch the following day.   Be sure to check in on yelp, you get a free beverage (we each got a glass of wine)  Has its own parking lot. They don't take American Express though  Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Traditional Italian in full definition. Family working in the kitchen and coming around to tables to meet everyone and talk, huge portions of very delicately made food, slow service (but on purpose, traditionally dinner is about relaxing through the meal - no rush) and high-end price wize. They have their own house wine imported from Italy, unique to them. The bread is fantastic. Everything on the menu is home made: all the sauses and entrees. The food itself is 5 star, like, it was the best thing I ate on this trip, but I docked a star from the review because it was very slow. We were sitting for over a half hour before placing our order. This isn't a complaint, more of a disclaimer/warning to others looking for a quick meal. This is the place to go if you have over an hour to dedicate to eating and hanging out. But if you are short on time, I suggest calling in your order to go, and going back when you have more time."}
