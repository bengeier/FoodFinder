{"text":"Ordered via UberEATS and didn't know what to expect as I could not find any reviews.... I was not disappointed. The deep fried burger exceeded expectations. Perfectly cooked, I ate every last bite.   The BLT was like one your mom would make you, tons of bacon and just delicious. BBQ pork fries were delicious and the grilled cheese burger was good as well.   The rotel and homemade chips were AMAZING. Only negative and the reason I couldn't give a full 5 stars was they didn't fill the cup all the way on the rotel.   Would order here again for sure. Amazing. Give it a try, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The absolute worst, tasteless \"beer bratwurst\" ever! First they split the brat, then grilled it flat until it was totally dried out (who on earth does that to a beer brat?) and then made it even worse by serving it with a few peppers and onions on a dry old hotdog bun that had split totally apart. I can't adequately describe how incredibly horrible it was. The single  star is for the accompanying shoestring fries which were actually palatable."}
{"text":"Excellent service and exceptional food.  Defitinetly ago to place if I'm in the area or on uber eats"}
{"text":"First time eating food from here. This is a grill inside of a bar. The Burger I got was called the \"killer burger.\" it is a cheeseburger with LTO and instead of a bun it's stuck between two grilled cheese sandwiches. It's a lot of bread but it was very good and filling. The fries I got were well seasoned and flavorful as well. I will defiantly order from here again if I get the opportunity"}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering here through postmates. I had a order of chicken fingers and a small pepperoni pizza. I couldn't enjoy the chicken fingers because they were a tad dry and the fries were blah. The pizza was very cheesy, which I love. I just wish they would've gave me a few more pepperonis. The pizza should've been cooked longer. Despite my rating, I would definitely come back and try new things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst I've ever had delivered to me. My pizza is the worst ever. Way to show your customer you don't give 2 shits about them. I most definitely will never come or order from here ever again!"}
{"text":"The food was trash. My boyfriend is upset he wasted his money. The pizza tasted worse than school pizza. The fries were barely warm. It was just over all bad and I wish I could put 0 stars because that's what it was."}
