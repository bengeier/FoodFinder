{"text":"After discovering the Wings here, we've fallen 'in love'. The Dry rub are the girlfriends favourite and the BBQ flavours are delicious.  Did I mention the wings are huge. Much better value than what I've eaten lately in Toronto. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"CLOSED / OUT OF BUSINESS dont even try.  Dont even worry, you didnt miss anything special."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have had excellent food and service. First time was for breakfast, and the standard eggs and sausage were great, but the best part was the special oat cakes they include (believe me they taste better than they sound) Also take note of their coffee, The best in town for sure! 
Second visit I again used the patio, a deck found at the back of the house(pub). Again had a great atmosphere, service and food. Being a pub I went for the fish and chips, and was not disappointed. The prices a good and will come back again."}
{"text":"I imagine that I'm not going to be too popular amongst the locals but I felt, for the first time, that my fellow Yelpers had let me down. We'd spent the day just north of here and having missed lunch, were starving. The restaurant we originally planned on going to was closed for a staff event so, needless to say, I hopped onto Yelp to find somewhere we could eat that was on our way home.

Five stars they say.

When I see bangers and mash on a menu, it's difficult for me to turn down it down and my husband had had his mind set on a Rubin all day so our fate was per-decided before we even walked in.

The bangers, beans and mash came with three links of pork sausage, baked beans, mashed potatoes, vegetables and gravy on the side. First of all, the bangers were extremely porky with very little seasoning rendering them almost unpalatable and the vegetables were frozen mixed vegetables from a bag. Plain and simple. No thought, no taste and certainly not worth $14.

My husband definitely chose the better meal.  His Rubin, although small (and extremely watery), tasted fine and it came with a nice size salad that seemed to be dressed well.

We both finished our meals although I suspect out of sheer starvation and the wait staff was pleasant and quick. In fact, I think she might have saved me from leaving a rating of just 1 star.

0 stars for my meal, 1 star for my husband's and 1 star for our waitress.

Enough said."}
