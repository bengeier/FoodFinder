{"text":"Great food, friendly atmosphere!! Fair prices, love the daily special idea!  Owners and waitstaff warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"I drive by this area everyday, and I'm kicking myself now that yesterday was the first time I decided to stop in. I must admit that I wasn't expecting the quality of service and food, or the value at that. We came in early evening on Valentine's Day. We learn from the husband and wife team who own and run the restaurant that every menu item is prepared fresh and made to order. We ordered a fish taco, steak taco, and pork taco. Mind blown! They were 6 inch tacos, and each was fresh, inventive, flavorful, and delicious. Only $2 each on Tuesdays. We also ordered chili cheese fries, and without a doubt the best I've ever had. By the time we headed out around 6pm or so, the place was really filling up. There's also a patio, lots of games, and surprisingly kid friendly. See you next week!

(PS.. I'd like to note after reading reviews, someone noted that they only have a high rating because they challenge poor reviews. I would disagree. This place has a high rating because it's awesome!)"}
{"text":"Went there on an in prompt to lunch. Had the PB&J burger. It was AMAZING! The service was exceptional and the prices are fair. They were even thoughtful enough to give me gloves."}
{"text":"I was expecting a really fun little place after reading the reviews on Yelp, but the food was a major disappointment. We ordered wings (the double) and they came out as if they had been recooked several times and even seemed to have a bit of a rancid taste.

The server was very nice and took good care of us (hence 2 stars instead of 1)."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in town. Soon i will try the pizza burger or the Peanut Butter and jelly burger!! Btw, ypu can play games!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying out this place and WE LOVED IT! We had 10 alcoholic beverages, 2 shots, an appetizer, and 2 meals, for less than $60!!! The service was AMAZING! And they have tons of board games, foosball, air hockey, and darts for little to no extra cost! The food was amazing and the drinks were great, definitely coming here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is great.  Food is amazing and service is awesome.   Would completely recommend."}
{"text":"Out in Chandler stopped in the bar and grill the deep died carrot sticks and 3 little pig burger and fries were delicious. They have this awesome sauce they make , taking a bottle home! The owners Jenny and Bret vey nice we bs's while we ate lunch lol. Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"First time in for my wife and I. We were very happy the service and the food. The owners were on point. Another thing that is usually an issue is cleanliness, this place is clean and the music isn't too loud. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. This place is absolutely amazing! I stopped by this place with a friend for lunch one day. The waitress politely greeted us and asked us what we would like to eat. I let her know it was my first time in and asked if she had any recommendations. She pointed out a few favorites, but then told me that everything on their menu was delicious and freshly cooked. I've heard A LOT of waiters/waitresses tell me the same BS and had it be terrible. But this place stuck to their word and served me one of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my life! The service, prices, and food was some of the best I've been to in the STATE! On top of that they have Ski-Ball, Darts, Pool, and Jenga! It's a great little place to stop by for lunch and have some beers for a great price.

Huge shout out to the owners, don't change what you're doing because it's perfect as is!! I absolutely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food and good service. This is a hidden gem in an easily accessible part of town. You should try it. The Phoenix burger and the hand cut fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today after driving by this place,  Brad makes an amazing burger and even though I'm not a fresh fry person theirs are amazing. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Nice relaxing environment with great food.  They offer typical bar/pub staples and then some with a twist. We had some honey bbq wings and then split a club sandwich with fries.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good little local bar. Best onion ring we have ever had. Good people, drinks, food, and board games."}
{"text":"Wife:  This bar had a very cozy and welcoming atmosphere.  The owner introduced himself and engaged in conversation with us.  We enjoyed hanging out drinking beer and playing darts with some friends.  We would definitely come back!

Hubby:  Very open place.  Most places are themed but this place seems stuck in between.  Either way, waitress was nice, bartender was gracious and talkative.  Asked why they didn't have a pool table as they have the space and he said they once did but nobody played.  First time playing darts was on our visit.  Seems like it could turn into a nice local watering hole if more locals started coming.  Wings and fries were good and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Bad service. Unfriendly bartender who twice tried giving me a beer that was only 3/4 full. I called her out on it the second time and she blamed it on being foamy because it's an IPA. She reluctantly filled my beer to the top and was obviously upset that I did not just take a beer that was not poured properly. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"First time here, service was fast and friendly! The food was fresh and delicious! The place itself is clean and has tons of games! This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Our new favorite Friday night spot! The owners work there and are very friendly. Great service and fun atmosphere. The prices are reasonable and they have specials everyday.

The owner is also the chef and takes pride in the food he serves. There is so much flavor in everything we've tried there. The chicken sandwiches are great and so are the beef tips. Their fries are fresh, made in site from real potatoes, not frozen."}
{"text":"First time here and I was blown away by the food quality and quantity. A friendly and welcoming place for adult and kids together. great service and fun atmosphere. Keep the good work. Love it."}
{"text":"When you walk in you wouldn't expect what you get. Friendly owners who make it a point to make sure that your experience here is great. Food... Honesty delish! Drinks are so tasty and cheap. Chicken salad which my hubby had was so good and I had the chicken wigs which were out of this world. We will definitely come back worth the family."}
{"text":"Amazing prices and awesome food. We found a new place to hang out!!!! Super nice people and fresh food. The best chili cheese fries we've ever had!
We continue to frequent this place. The patty melt is to die for!"}
{"text":"Came here week 3 of being open. Surprisingly they had a lot of customers. We enjoyed our dinner and drinks. My fiancee gor philly cheesesteak and fried. I got memphis dog (chill, cole slaw) plus tatertot casserole. My fiancee loved his. I thought mine was ok. I like the chili and cole slaw didnt love the dog...i think bc polish and I wasnt expecting it. Tatertot casserole was something special in a good way! Drinks fairly priced. Will be back. I hope they continue to do well. Owners are super friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Family owned restaurant and fresh food. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome!  Very personable and accommodating.  Been here about 4 or 5 times and have always been impressed with the service.  As for the food... best bar food in all of Chandler.  Everything seems to be home made.  I've eaten a few things off the menu and everything has been outstanding!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some food and drinks and ended up staying for 3 hours!
Moderately priced drinks. Unique dishes and lots of games to play. My fianc√© and I played Sorry, Don't Break the Ice, Battleship, and darts. They also have a Foosball Table and Air Hockey. Tons of board games."}
{"text":"We found this by chance! Amazing! Jenni and Brett the owners were awesome,very personable and friendly. We sat at the bar and had a great time, chill place- clean and fun! We both had wings, great spices and flavor. The hamburgers were the best we have ever had; fries are perfect. All the food is made from scratch in house, nothing frozen or microwaved, ever! Don't forget to ask for a sample of the BS sauce- yummy!  U must stop by and eat a burger, seriously the best!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, you walk into a carpeted bar. The waitress was very rude and we actually didn't bother staying for food we were so turned off by this place


We actually walked in I ordered a shock top and my gf and her sister ordered a coors light. I comment to the waitress that it didn't taste like a normal shock top that it tasted like one of their seasonals. This is when the argument occurred. 

The reason this place has a 5 star rating is not because it's worthy of 5 stars it is because the owner and or manager insists on reporting or removing any negative comments. A true leader would look at the problem and try to address it instead of trying to cover it up."}
{"text":"Starting with the incredible cuisine choices of the Maestro, the expert, the genius (that is Brett).  I'm eating carrots this man created that are both sweet and spicy!  There is a magic element afoot, I dare say.

Jenni (Brett's wife and business partner) is charming and always first to ask \"What can I get you?\".

Expecting common bar fare here?  Nah!  It is homemade and original, with just a dash of \"bet you can't guess what this is\" as your mouth waters.  Oh, and your wallet won't take a beating.  Why?  Most of the items are less than $10, plus 25% off for a limited time!

Give your taste buds a treat and come out to see the new kid on the block, Local Play Yard.

{"text":"Just pulled in....good spot to a drink....food special was awesome...huge plate of chili dogs....biker friendly....clean joint....owners very friendly...I recommend you stopping  into this new bar"}
{"text":"I read they were from NC and local to us now, so we wanted to support them. They were very nice, food was quick, beer was cold and the fries were amazing. I didn't say anything to them, so they couldn't fix it, but I didn't like the burger. The IPA/craft beer selection was small, but what they had was quality. Overall, it was a good place for fries, catch a game, have a good beer and get great service. We'd go back for another try."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for wings, they are amazing. Super friendly family owned place with great drink specials and kid friendly environment. The owners always make it a point to say hello and invite us back. Don't forget to point out where you're from by dropping a pin on their map on the wall."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The owner actually hung out and took time to chat with us! I'm very excited to keep stopping in. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Food is literally what I was looking for. Staff and owners are awesome!!! They always take care of their customers. Burgers ate amazing. Taco Tuesday is the best. Air hockey, darts, board games. Good place to hang with friends and family. Love it here."}
