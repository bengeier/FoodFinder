{"text":"My husband and I have been searching for the best Buffalo wings. We are wing lovers! This place is now our all time favorite. We ordered the mild and hot wings with a request to have them fried crispy. All I can say is ... Perfection! To make the wings even better is the creamy ranch dressing that was addictive. My 18 month old actually finished his entire kids meal since he dipped all his fries in this tasty ranch. My 9 yr old, who is a picky eater...also ate his entire kids meal (Grilled Cheese.) His sandwhich was grilled to perfection. We went at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon, it was quiet with few patrons. However, by the time we left the place began to get crowded. Seems as if others, know of the great food at this sweet quaint tavern. Our service was excellant, we did not have to wait on refills and she brought us enough napkins, hand wipes, and plates to enjoy our Buffalo wing meal. This is a must try...I will surely tell all my friends about this great find!"}
{"text":"We live near Lake Wylie but this was my first trip to Cramerton.  I was a bit shocked that Center St (effectively Main St) was about five businesses (on one side of the road).  Anyway, we gave it a shot.   I'm a beer aficionado (so I think anyway) and was pleasantly surprised with the large selection of bottled beers and also a good selection on tap (roughly 10 or so) for a small establishment like this.  Kudos...keep it up.   We tried the buffalo chicken wrap and a Reuben sandwich...typical pub foods.  Both were pretty good...about what you'd expect from a decent quality pub.   Otherwise, the ambiance was also a plus...a dark wood, low-light environment that was warm and welcoming.   Overall, a good experience that'll I'll soon revisit.   Support your local businesses and forget about the chains!"}
{"text":"A really nice menu.  Has the feel of a modern English pub.  Service is friendly and efficient.  Everything I have tried on the menu has been well prepared and delicious.  I love the atmosphere and it is a place I will revisit from time to time.  Wishing Mount Holly could have a place like this!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy, slow service, food came within minutes of salad, they were out of MR prime rib and brought out MW when I told the server I ordered MR he said yes he knew that but they were out so they gave me what they had. Needless to say I won't be back. I will say that once I told him that was not acceptable he asked me if I would like to order something else so I ordered the sirloin and it came out perfect."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It has really neat atmosphere and servers are very friendly.    Food is OK too.  But not the best. So, I give it 4 stars. I wouldn't get the tuna appetizer again, everything else is decent."}
{"text":"I hate writing this review update but I've been back many, many times over the last year and unfortunately the food quality has gone way down.  I only go to Center Street on trivia night and the service is usually pretty slow.  This could be because of the trivia but we stopped in for breakfast recently and had the same problem.  I've now tried most items on the menu and there are only a few simple meals I still enjoy (like the BLT, but how hard is it to make a good BLT?).  I finally had to commit to revoking two stars after I was severely disappointed with my cold food and coffee at breakfast last weekend.  I still think Center Street is a good place to grab a drink and hang out with a friend but you might not want to go when you're starving."}
{"text":"Went there last night with wife and daughter. The hostess seemed put off when I asked for a table away from the door (due to the cold air).. After taking a while to decide what we wanted, the waiter informs us that the pork chops my wife wants and the rack of ribs that I want are no longer available. Note to owner: If you can't afford to print new menus then try using a sharpie to black out the items you no longer offer. What we did order was ok, but nothing special.Seriously, it shouldn't take 20 minutes to bring out 3 wraps when you are not very busy. Also, you may want to turn on the heater. Bottom line, I try to support local businesses but you need to do your part and provide an enjoyable experience. Last night you failed."}
{"text":"We love to come here on Tuesdays. They have awesome trivia. The food is okay & great beer specials. Great Brunch on Sunday too!"}
{"text":"2nd time in the joint and must say.   Same as before.  This go around I went with the grouper bites, fried pickles ( of course) and the chicken salad croissant (and o rings since fries are too starchy.  :) )      Grouper was really good and the chicken salad, I must say,  could have used something a bit more.  Bland for my taste but I know restaurant food and if it has too much of something you get a complaint of too much pepper, too much mayo, too much whatever.   Overall,  the tomato and lettuce were crisp, the croissant was as fresh as you can expect in Cramerton, the honey Dijon was a nice touch as well.   I honestly could not taste the pecans in the pecan chicken salad and would prefer grapes added for texture and color, but overall not bad at all.  A girl in the group who happens to be fairly picky thought the potato soup was really good.  I had a cup as well and it was good, real good.   Needed chives though.   Biggest draw to this place.    The menu is fairly big and there is something for everyone.   The atmosphere is great.  and the staff,  the staff is awesome.    Jessica, the bar keep took care of my table as soon as we sat since the server was on her way  out the door.   Jessica, made sure our drinks were always full and constantly asked us if we would like anything else.   She was very friendly and courteous the whole time.   I can't ask for much more from a server that had to visit our table 4 times as much as a normal table since we were there to work on another project and not there just to eat.      Two thumbs up Jessica.    Great job.   To the owner of Center.   Love your place and will use it any time I am meeting people in your area.     Thanks.  -Corbin.  Dang.  I forgot to get something with the spicy ranch they have.   crud.   oh well next time."}
{"text":"Rude bartender and waitresses. Made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Who knew little old Cramerton was hiding a tasty little tavern? Nice, clean wood feel to the place, with booths along one wall and plenty of tables throughout. Nice mix of beers listed up on a chalkboard next to the bar. We stopped in for an early Thursday dinner and the atmosphere was relaxed and the music at a nice decibel to hear each other talk.  i strayed from the always tempting buffalo chicken and ordered the Ranucci's BBQ Plate with kick your butt sauce and two sides. i thoroughly enjoyed the pulled pork and sauce. For my sides i ordered creamy mashed potatoes and sauteed seasonal veggies. The mashed potatoes were definitely creamy, not bad but not i don't think creamy taters are my favorite. The veggies however were my favorite. Quite a mix of mushroom, red pepper, squash, zucchini, and onions with delicious flavor. For beers, we had a $3 OMB Copper and a $4 Bells Best Brown. As we were deciding on our beers, our server brought a sample of the Bells leading us to select that one.   Service and food were fantastic. i know we'll be back and if we ever tire of constantly having to try new places, this is on my list for places i'd like to frequent. Also of note, they do currently have a $5 off $25 coupon online."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place and really want to like it, but it is hit or miss.  We have eaten here for breakfast, brunch, and dinner and the quality of the food and service is inconsistent.  They have a very nice beer selection and a nice variety of food.  However, twice when we have been for dinner they were out of what I ordered which is a huge pet peeve.  I recommend the pimento cheese omelet for breakfast and the pimento cheese burger for dinner (really, I'm not a pimento cheese fanatic!), but again sometimes the food is great and sometimes it is just OK.  The customer service could possibly make up for this but even when they aren't busy it is often slow and inattentive.  This could be a great place if they'd step up their game!"}
{"text":"I give restaurants a 3 strike rule, and most of the time never hit it. Well, add this one to the list. Went last sat night.  Strike 1- atmosphere. I was expecting it to be a tad bit darker than a cafeteria but it was super bright in there. It didn't help that the light at our table was missing its cover. You'd think a nice tavern would invite relaxation with a little dimmer lighting, but not so much here.  Strike 2- Menu. Lots of choices, which usually gets a small, local place in trouble. If you no longer offer an item or something has changed, please update your menu accordingly. Gf wanted to order pork chops, but was informed they no longer offer them. I was set on the new offering of ribs and pulled BBQ chicken. When I ordered it I was informed it's actually not pulled chicken, but a choice of chicken breast or pulled pork. It's pretty simple, update your menu when things change.  Strike 3- food. Gf got the salmon and said it was decent, but nothing special. I got the ribs, which were the new offering. Welp, pretty confident they were frozen ribs slapped into an oven and slathered with some grocery store BBQ sauce. If I wanted that, I'd go down to the local grocer and spend a lot less money reheating something frozen myself. If you can't offer a menu with items that you make fresh, then why have a restaurant. I can play \"chef\" at home by reheating some frozen junk.  Anyways, pretty good beer selection and the place really good be a good spot, but needs a lot of changes."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area and setting up camp temporarily in sleepy Cramerton, I was jazzed to find this cute pub along the 50 yards that is Center Street.  It was a Thursday night, and this joint was packed. Booths on the left, open seating throughout and a cozy bar in the back. Large TVs throughout would make this a worthy destination for game-watching.  Though we were bummed to learn the kitchen was out of the fried pickle appetizer, we enjoyed the consolation handmade chips with ranch dressing. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on kaiser--with a low threshhold for heat the mild sauce was enough--and my dining companion had the BBQ plate. Ask for extra sauce for the latter, since the amount that comes with it pales in comparison to the BBQ serving. Both entrees were good and better than your average bar food.  And let's talk about beer. Local brews on draft, all good, and if you can't decide get the five-draft flight--a tasty tour from lager to porter in highball glasses.  If you're wondering about the Thursday night crowd, my guess is because it was wine night--$10 house bottles. And CSTR has its ways to lure you in other nights of the week, from trivia on Tuesday to $3 draft night. For us it's all of the above and the fried pickles. Hope they'll have stocked up for next time."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while and finally tonight my husband and I stopped in for dinner at the bar.  The service was friendly, atmosphere was a nice surprise for such a small town and we both were really happy with our meals.  We will definitely be back. A great local spot."}
