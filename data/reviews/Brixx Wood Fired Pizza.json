{"text":"Pizza was good, but the place was dirty. I could get over the floors because it was busy,  but the glasses had grit all over them inside and out. The server brought us new drinks,  but those were the same.   He finally brought us plastic to-go cups,  and said he'd tell the manager.   Manager never came to say anything."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit I tend to always get the same things at my favorite restaurants.  I always get their turkey wrap and bean salad... uh doggie, good stuff, that bean salad (ummm mmm) .....   I get a big container sometimes just to take home.  Their Margarita pizza is exceptionally tasty as well.  Prices aren't bad less then 10 bucks for a meal.  They have a great patio area for people watching.  I went there today for lunch and they were a bit crowded as Birkdale typically is on the weekends.  The bar area is nice but I always find it to be a bit loud in there.  I like it outside.  Also, they are doggie friendly and as long as you tie fiddo to the outside of the patio railing he can sit and enjoy the people watching too.   I think it is one of my favorite affordable casual dining spots in the Birk."}
{"text":"Good food at the right prise. The wait staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. Enjoy the night and eat outside!"}
{"text":"Seems over-rated.  The salad wasn't that good and the pizza was ok.  Since it's walking distance to my apartment I'll probably go back again, but it's not going to be the first place I think of."}
{"text":"I lived in the Charlotte area again from 2010 to early 2013, and my wife and I ate at this Brixx location on several occasions. I love a good wood-fired pizza, and Brixx doesn't disappoint. Not a big beer drinker, so can't comment on that, but the pizza is great. I have also eaten at the one in Dilworth. Different vibe, but same great food. Now that I am back in Colorado, my best wood-fired pizza is A-Town in Aurora (which is great), but it lacks the ambiance of Brixx."}
{"text":"Great selection of pizzas from their wood fired stove, very good salads, very good selection of beers on tap.  Peak times can be packed..."}
{"text":"We returned here last night; it has been a regular spot since we moved to the area 4 years ago.  The pizza combinations they offer are creative and delicious.  The oven-baked thin crusts are delicious.  The ingredients are always fresh.  Many of the pizzas feature fresh herbs.  The service is always prompt and friendly.  It is a fun place to be and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good service, good draft selection, decent prices... Nothing much more to say."}
{"text":"While shopping at Birkdale Village I decided to have lunch and ended up getting a spinich salad and their meatball marinara dish.  The salad was average but the marinara dish was great!  They served the light (not heavy or thick)fresh tasting sauce over angel hair with basil and the meatballs were delicious.  Took leftovers home and my husband loved it as well.  The pizzas looked fresh and will definitely go back to try some."}
{"text":"Really. Good. Pizza.  Great variety of beer and wine.  If you are in downtown, and want a good meal, eat here."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza always brings me in. The crust could use a little more oil to it but all in all not bad. They have a few GF beers as well."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bronx bomber and breadsticks. Food was excellent and the service was very friendly. Good pizza"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great salads, varied menu, good staff, and ok pricing.  Pizza and other items.  Tasty and nice.  A bit crowded sometimes but they have extensive seating."}
{"text":"Brixx is one of our favorite restaurants in Birkdale. We take visiting family & friends there a lot and we've yet to have someone not love it! The pizza is delicious, right down to the crust. We also love the bruschetta."}
{"text":"We just returned from one of the WORST dining experiences of our lives. We went with another couple with free pizza coupons from a previously bad experience. (Our waitress that night flipped out on another group after she rudely took our order.....ended up walking out and then returning only to quit). We were ready to start fresh with positive attitudes.  We were seated at a table near the restrooms which was also the location for some kind of table game that was swarmed by some of the loudest, most boisterous, unattended children I have ever been around indoors. Their parents were conveniently dining outside where it was pleasantly quiet. We complained to our waitress and she apologized and said Friday's were usually noisy with the kids. It took 50 minutes for our pizzas to arrive. These children were continually running in and out of the door for the entirety of our visit. We could not even carry on a conversation with each other without screaming. It seems that the restaurant encourages this type of behavior by allowing this to happen and not stopping the children from screaming and running though the restaurant.  Our waitress told us she would send the manager over to speak with us but this didn't happen. As we were leaving he was in the kitchen making pizzas and was not available to speak with us. We would have had to speak with him outside in order to carry on a conversation.  Had we been offered more coupons to appease us we would have turned them down.  I will NEVER visit this location ever again. It was extremely unpleasant."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Love their wood fired pizzas. I have been here a couple of times. On my last visit, I ordered for a Hawaiian Pizza and it was delicious. Since it is very near to my office, definitely going back here whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"Had the new pizza which was the Italian cheese steak. We didn't like it. The fontina pimento cheese and the shaved roast beef wasn't a good match in my opinion, had half of it left but didn't take it home.    We order some of our favorites which was the spicy shrimp pizza, 2 x pasta pomodoro shrimp and carbonara shrimp.... yes I love shrimp... don't look down on me. Everything was amazing as always. The server was lacking. She was either outside talking or can't be found so we couldn't get refills or order more food.   The food will always bring me back!"}
{"text":"every time I'm here the food and service are excellent. Ask for Adam, he's special cloth. Jill is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bronx Bomber to go.  The first thing that impressed me was the phone call.  When I asked \"what's the most popular\" I was immediately answered with the Bronx Bomber.  This tells me that they actually know their menu and pay attention to their customers.  When I walked in I found a trendy looking restaurant with a nice bar.  The gentleman at the bar  (may have been a manager) was very personable with a good sense of humor.  The pizza was great. Crispy, thin and delicious. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience.  During the summer, Birkdale Village has live music on the weekends.  The patio at Brixx provides an excellent view of the band. It's also covered by lots of trees, which provide much needed shade (and an occasional leaf in your drink).   Go on Sunday for half-priced bottles of wine. I had the the arugula and pear salad, which was quite tasty.  The staff were very friendly and attentive. It was a good experience. I'll have to come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Great wood oven baked pizzas (you can watch them make it in front of you in the very clean kitchen) and Karissa and Laurel are friendly and attentive bartenders.  Great parking (an obsession of many in the uptown area).  Gets crowded before and after arena events but (1) it's right next to the arena and (2) they can handle the crowd."}
{"text":"Went here last week and I have tried another location in the past. This visit was not pleasant. Our waitress was inattentive, missing most of our meal and unfriendly. My salad was pretty good but my husband's cheese pizza had black crust but he refuses to send food back. The TV was showing a cop/detective type show and someone was being choked with a rope. There were young children present, so one of the many TV's playing it was changed but not the others. Overall, we were annoyed to wait on drink so long, the food so long(they did not have many occupied tables at this time), asked for more drinks that never arrived and so on. We won't spend money their again. It's obvious customer service and pride in ones job is not the mantra there. People pay to eat out because they don't just want a meal made for them but they also want an enjoyable wait staff."}
{"text":"i love this place, me and my family drive up here at least once a month!! i love the special they have a night. love coming here after my workdays to hang out with family, but just the other day i ordered pasta and it tasted really wierd. and the water i was drink did also, idk what was up with that but still will come back again!!"}
{"text":"It was not wood fire pizza!   The whole reason I look for wood fire pizza places is to get the smoke flavor/smell in the pizza.  While the oven had wood in it, it was heated by the gas flame and very very very little smoke was coming from the wood.   Extremely dissapointed   if it were not for the attentive staff, I would have given it 1 star.  The service was attentive.  If you are calling yourself a wood fire pizza restaurant then TURN OFF THE GAS... do it right!"}
{"text":"Brixx is truly a great place to go for any occasion.  They have an amazing selection of pizza.  I think I have had every single one and only dislike the pear and gorgonzola pizza.  They also have a great beer selection and have plenty of great specials especially on Monday nights. My wife and I like to have a snack for dinner and go for their late night 2 for 1 pizza special."}
{"text":"Birxx has a rather nice size menu and written out upon that menu is the statement that all of their pizzas can be made vegan. That's very comforting to me. Also the service is right quick, even when it's busy.  The pizza it's self is a nice thin crust. I have yet to have any of their pizza with a traditional sauce but their olive oil based sauce is decent, though i think it could use more garlic. The bruschetta is awesome though, and for my vegan friends, make sure to request it with pita chips.  The pizza are designed for one person to be able to eat. First time there for a light meal, I split a pizza with a friend and had to order more food. Note I'm not a massive eater either.  Good beer selection and drink specials. I would say they boast upwards of 20 different beer on their menu. Usually you can get a pretty good deal on them too."}
{"text":"Waste of time & money!! Thinnest pizza ever!! Paper thin, hardly any toppings, no sauce. I asked the waiters about a deep dish pizza they said the paper-thin ones were the only style they serve."}
{"text":"One word, ugh. In dire need of upgrades. Dirty floor, cardboard pizza. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Truth be told, I did not like Brixx initially.  The main issue I had is that I like \"traditional pizza.\"  You know, bread, sauce, cheese.. the dominoes stuff.  But you can just ask for it!  They'll make whatever you want, not just the artisan pizzas that they have on the menu.  I love the traditional cheese pizza with proscuitto.  Very good and not too salty.  Perfect!  They have a great beer special and I cannot remember the day but it is 2.50/pint AND they have Fat Tire.  My favorite!!!  Brixx has really become one of my favorite places to dine.  Great for families, too!"}
{"text":"I got their (wood-roasted?) vegetable pizza with vegan cheese, and I was taken aback at how tasty it was. Hands-down this was the best vegan cheese I've ever eaten. The portion sizes were a bit too big, but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. The pizza had no taste and cold and seemed made in the morning and just reheated when we ordered. The bruschetta was even worse. I would not advise and definitely over priced for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"I love the Rustica pizza.  Great salads."}
{"text":"I don't understand why they only have an average of 3 1/2 stars! They definitely deserve a 5 star rating! My husband and I have been here several times and we've never had a bad experience (whether the service or food)! We have tried 9 of their pizzas so far, and 8 out of 9 we LOVED! The other one was good too, just not as mind blowing (for us) as the rest. We've also tried a salad, a pasta, and an appetizer... NEVER disappointed. Plus the draught beer selection?? We've been here when they were busy and with a large party and have never had a problem with the service. C'mon people 5 stars!! Keep it up Brixx!!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza place in town but it does taste better then say... Dominos, Dominos ins cheaper though!   Went with a big group and shared a salad and a Chicken Caprese Pizza. I dislike the \"we only can make 10\" pizzas\" propaganda. If a big group comes in please make one big pizza! The pizza needed salt but the salad was great. The salad had some great fresh mozzarella on it .  With the volume level being so high and overall not being super-impressed I probably wont return."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I visited this location on a busy Friday night. We were told that the wait was about 15 mins, but honestly it was busy so we expects to wait some. After about 30 mins my husband teased the manager saying he was starving etc. THIS manager was so AWESOME- he asked us what our fav appetizer was and he sent it to our table - on him! I love this place- MARC ANTHONY (mgr) is FANTASTIC and knows how to make his customers feel appreciated! Thanku Brixx and Thanku MARC!!"}
{"text":"Im hate to be the bad guy! But this was the worst pizza and salad ive tried. How can you mess up a salad? Nothing had flavor. The chicken on the salad tasted like bolied chicken noo flavor at all. The pizzas where almost raw. Super white at the bottom and very soggy. Sauce had no flavor. Only thing i liked was the blue moon i had! The people that seat you down didn't even greet us when we walked in, they just looked at us and we had to ask if we seat ourselves or what. How ever our server was great.  First and last time at this place."}
{"text":"This review is based on a carryout order. Bought brixx late night to take advantage of the BOGO pizzas after 10pm Sun-thur. I can't complain. Fresh pizzas, smooth transaction. Literally walked in to get my pizzas and walked right back out. 4 pizzas for $20? Yes please! Will be ordering from you guys again!"}
{"text":"I liked their pizza v much... Had pepperoni Americano and the Bronx Bomber-  Bronx bomber was very good...  Will surely come back again.."}
{"text":"Good food, good service!   I love their cajun penne pasta dish. And my daughter loves going here for their Shirley Temple's drink. They also have a full bar and big screen tvs for you to watch sports and the news while you're there.   Its in a super friendly area and great for family night out or for late night socializing."}
{"text":"Brixx never disappoints! I love the mozzarella sandwich but have them exchange the french bread for foccacia. Mmm! The last time I went the hostess was not the friendliest but our server was excellent!"}
{"text":"I went to another branch of this chain, but it's similar, I'm sure.  I really enjoyed the pizza I had--the pear and gorgonzola--and the waitress was attentive.  I think I drank 5 gallons of water.  The food came out pretty quickly, and it was an overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! light sauce, thin, crispy crust piled with toppings. I was passing through the area and got the beer sampler of 4 NC craft brews, good option if you're not sure what microbrew to try! Splitting one 10\" pizza is enough for two people. Overall very, very good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mid afternoon late lunch, pizza took less than 7 minutes, had good taste and texture, but didn't knock me off my feet.  Size was right to fill me up and I can eat some pizza.  Total w tea was over $14.00 so not much as a value that's why the 3 stars and not 4. Service was very good but there was only 5 people in their."}
{"text":"Waitress took forever.. salad was dry and pizza was just gross and honestly overcooked. Won't be coming back here again"}
{"text":"I've been to Brixx on a few separate occasions. Typically I order the Buffalo Chicken Pizza or the Bronx Bomber. For lunch they have a pizza/small salad combo. I would not recommend this option as the portion is tiny, you're better off ordering the entire pizza. Pizza is pretty good, but for its price, around $14 after tip, I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Exciting and attractive interior, friendly attentive staff, and decent beer specials (at least when I was there on a Sunday).  The spinach/artichoke dip was pretty tasty.  My wife and I each had a pizza and ordered half/half so effectively we were able to taste four different pizzas.  They were decent but nothing special.  I think the pizza dough itself is what made it boring...kind of a strange softness although you could see it was cooked adequately.  I'd recommend this for a place to watch a game or hang out with a few friends while sharing some pizza.  However, if you're looking for really good pizza, I feel that Brixx falls a little short."}
{"text":"Since I work late and dont get off til after 11pm I found this place open til 1am which is GREAT!!! What is even better is the pizza!!! The selection and different vareities and different crusts that are offered are awesome!!! The staff are helpful and friendly and the food is well worth coming in for. Recommend this place highly for relaxing kicking back and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Sat for 20 minutes without a single glance from any of the three waitresses that breezed in and out from inside to the patio and back.  They helped others, but ignored us.  Even the young lady who seated us, when she seated another couple, did not look to see if anyone had helped us.  Used to be one of our favorite places.  Not any more!!"}
{"text":"It was delicious. High quality ingredients. It wasn't super expensive. The food did not take very long to get to our table after ordering. We had the Hawaiian pizza. The prosciutto was to die for. There didn't seem to be any wait staff on duty when we visited but the bartender did an excellent job waiting tables and taking care of the bar. He was super nice and friendly but not obnoxious. He also sent us home with a carry out menu that I am sure we will make good use out of."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with good food.  This was our second visit and both times it was well worth it.  Both times we arrived around 5:45pm on a Friday, so the 5-10 minute wait was expected.  Downside is the very limited amount of space and seats for people on the wait list.  Also the parking can be a nightmare, even with the large parking lot behind the building.  This will probably get worse as more stores open.  We started with the spinach and artichoke appetizer, which came with toasted garlic bread.  This was tasty and filling because of the amount of bread on the plate.  My wife ordered a salad with chicken while I ordered the Margarita pie, both were tasty and filling.    The best part, and surprising, was our server Monica.  My biggest pet-peeve is a server responding with \"no problem\" instead of your welcome.  Monica never used \"no problem\" during our 45 minute meal.  Additionally she understands how to be a good server, with a good mix of attentiveness and proactively anticipating our needs, such as small plates and asking my wife if she would like a to-go cup for her soda.  Might be worthwhile for the management to have other servers learn from her."}
{"text":"Brixx always has great food and our recent experience just shows they have excellent service as well! We recently did takeout for a change and unfortunately one item on the order when we got home was incorrect. We called back to the restaurant and spoke with a manager named Jeanna! She was awesome! Not only did they replace the incorrect order, they replaced the others as well to ensure they were all hot at the same time! In addition, they brought the food out to the car upon our return! Service like this, excellent food, no wonder they have remained a Birkdale icon! Thank you Jeanna and all the staff at Brixx!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday and it had to be the worst service I've ever had and we will not be back!   -Our drinks were empty half the time. -We ask for the check, and a couple boxes next thing i know, our waiter (Cody I.) is giving a message' to one of the bartenders, then walks over to the computer area that prints the checks, and hops on this phone while leaning on the wall checking out all the waitresses that are printing their checks in front of him.  We finally get the check, and then he disappears again.  Comes back to take the check, and still no boxes.  Finally we ask for our boxes, and he only brings one.  This was our first and only time to this location.  Also there appeared to be no manager on duty, because there were customers running behind the bar."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The food is decent, but not spectacular... a little too \"California-style\" for my tastes (I prefer Chicago-style pizza), but my wife and daughter liked it.  The staff was great.. all very friendly and professional (which is what made me put this at 3 stars instead of 2).  The prices are a bit steep."}
{"text":"One word: Bruchetta! AMAZING appetizer...salad also really good...very clean, white chicken."}
{"text":"The food here was ok. It had great flavor but the crust wasn't what I would call \"pizza\" crust. It was more like a fluffy tortilla or a thin pita. They lost a star for the crust. Now I know it's sometimes hard to control but there was a lot of nats or fruit flies. I had to take a star for that. I hate going to a restraint and having to shoo bugs away from my food. Nasty... They were fast and the food have great flavor, but not my favorite place to eat..."}
{"text":"We just had a really fantastic meal at this location.  We brought our little dog with us and sat on the porch.  Right away our server got us drinks and brought out a bowl for Alfie.  She doted on him and had great banter with us.  She was very sweet and attentive.  Our food came out quickly and our server kept our glasses full.  I got the prosciutto melon pizza which was fantastic and something I'll try to replicate at home.  My husband got the margherita pizza and we're looking forward to left overs and coming back for more.  We just moved from Philly and the pizza wasn't as great as home but comes close.  The crust was fantastic."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Brixx's in over 2 years but it has nothing to do with their food or service. Blakeney Shopping Center,  particularly on weekend evenings,  is terribly crowded so, in general,  we avoid eating at any restaurants there though we live less than 2 miles away.  That being said, we went there for a mid week lunch last week and as expected the food was great. I had their Hawaiian pizza though I swapped the sauce to a red sauce....it was great. Our server, I can't remember his name, was kind and friendly.  Overall, everyone in our party was pleased.  Brixx's has good food and a large beer selection.  Though it won't be on a weekend we will be back."}
{"text":"Brixx has different and unique pizzas.  Not your normal fair, though you can get that too.  It is not all about pizza either.  Their humus is exceptional. Probably the best part is that their pizza is the right size for one person.  Not too much... not too little."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great location.  I ordered their hawai'ian on whole wheat and it was quite tasty!  The crust was perfectly crunchy...  The only thing I'd change would be to have more size options for the pizzas.  I know they're brick oven so size is somewhat limited, but a 10\" pizza is too much to finish at one sitting and not enough to have a satisfying amount of left-overs....who wants to get a box for a single slice of pizza?"}
{"text":"Brixx is one of our family go-to places. They offer a variety of delicious pizza. My top two favorites are the Pear & Gorgonzola and the Greek. The pizza is thinner and you won't go hungry of you order one for yourself. I also enjoy their salad which consists of field greens, pumpkin seeds or pistachios (it changes), goat cheese, & a wonderful balsamic dressing.   The service at this location is always friendly. Management is often checking on tables, which I believe is a sign of a well run business."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Decent pizza but no real variety - i.e., all they serve is 10\" thin crust. Nothing magical imparted to the pizza being cooked in a wood-fired oven. Ordered root beer thinking that it was part of their coke-product offering. Turned out to be some premium root beer (which was good), but ended up being $5 for two glasses. No free refill on root beer, which they failed to mention. A lot of rave reviews here on yelp, but really don't understand why. Far better pizza in C-U and more reasonably priced..."}
{"text":"I went with the pepperoni pizza and it was average.  Maybe the other specialty pizzas have more flavor.  I was disappointed but hungry.  I would not be craving a pizza from here and probably won't come back.  The highlight were the meatballs which I found the meatballs to be tasty.  That's why I posted the pic."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots. Conveniently located on East blvd. Good beer selection.  Quick service. Friendly servers. Dog friendly patio.   My favorites are the spinach dip and bruschetta(sp?) for starters. And my go to pizza is buffalo chicken. I also add spinach on it and get it with blue cheese dressing on the side (and a wheat crush).   Check out the daily specials for food and drink. And get their beer perks card.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night, and had a buy one get one free pizza deal; the Bronx bomber and Meatball. Both where really excellent ... But the the general opinion was the Bronx was better. The ingredients were really fresh tasting and coupled with the slightly crisp crust... Pizza heaven. Fair warning though, I don't know if it is the norm here but the service we received was horrible. As in I had to walk over to my waitress to give her my check. As in I waited 10 minutes on a draft beer while she served others around us, who ordered after we did. At one point a she asked a different server to deliver the rest of our service while she went and sat down in a nearby corner. It was really embarrassing considering we were the only Hispanics in the place and seemed to be the only table she was having difficulty with. I'm not really sure what the issue was, but it was bad enough and embarrassing enough, I will not be returning. Good food cannot circumvent such hostile service. No thanks. I'll spend my money where they appreciate everyone's business."}
{"text":"My experience was outstanding I had a server named Robbie Decker he not only looked good but he also was well speaking and serve with humor and charm. He made the experience worth coming. The food was a little pricy but the service made it 100% better. If I ever come back to Bricks I would want a server like Robbie. This man deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Omg! So, I usually go to Brixx two Saturday nights a month with my girlfriend, after we get off of work for buy one get one free pizzas. Such a great deal! I will say I am very disappointed though.....we would each either get pimento cheese and pita chips off the appetizers or a pimento cheese pizza. It was great! I'm actually here now and found out that Brixx no longer carries the pimento cheese. We had our hearts set on it, could literally taste it before we arrived, and now we can't get it :( As much as I hate to state this, it might   deturd us from not coming as often. We really hope you get it back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Erin K. mentions the crowds.  I have, on occasion, picked up carry out from this location during peak dining hours.  It was difficult just to get in the door, let alone to find a place where I could pull someone aside and get my food.  So I concur: don't go when it's crowded.  This is one of the reasons Brixx is great, in fact: you don't have to go when it's crowded, because they are open until some insane time like 1 AM.  Is that a big deal in and of itself?  For starters, in Charlotte the answer is \"pretty much.\"  So few restaurants here are open late.  But the real key is that they are both open late and serving quality food until late.  The centerpiece of their offerings is their pizza.  This should not surprise you if you've looked at the name of the restaurant.  In my book the pizza actually deserves three stars, not four; but I think that's mainly because I don't care for this style of pizza, with thin crust and sparse sauce.  The ingredients are high quality and there are plenty to choose from.  One of my favorite pizzas is the Rustica, with garlic cloves, Kalamata olives, and red onions.  They used to have a special on (I think) Wednesday nights that was also very good; I think it was either an olive oil or a pesto base with blackened chicken, basil, and red onions again.  (If you want something that's not on the menu, ask them to make; they've never hassled me about that.)  Their salads are good, and their spinach artichoke dip is really quite good.  Staff is always very friendly and reasonably prompt.  Prices are very reasonable.  Go off hours (I used to show up at midnight; at the time they closed at 2 AM) and you won't have a problem having a nice meal.  Did I mention I love that they're open late?  (Disclaimer: last I checked they close at 10 PM on Sundays.  Also, after 10 PM or so it's pizzas and appetizers only.)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Exactly what I expected from a wood fired pizza. One of the best pizzas I've ever had! Service was great and they have a huge selection of beers. I am only in town for a week for business and I will be spending multiple days here!"}
{"text":"Thai chicken pizza was great. Friendly staff and great service. I will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wanting to try this new pizza place, we ordered 2 pizzas and Brixx Stixx for carryout around 11:40pm when they close at 1am. After 10pm they have their special, BOGO pizzas. I was told on the phone that the Stixx came with honey dijon and pizza sauce because they did not have cheese yet and it would be ready in 10 minutes. I walked in about 15 minutes later and there was not a soul in the place dining in. The guy who took my order joked that he \"forgot to put my order in\" and chuckled which insinuates a joke. It was not. I paid and waited for the pizzas, which I saw from standing at the bar, were one by one being put in the oven AFTER I paid and was waiting. I waited about 10 more minutes and was handed my pizzas and stixx. After getting home to eat, I realized the stixx came with 2 pizza sauces instead of honey dijon AND the pizza sauce. ...You would think with NO ONE in the restaurant, they would be able to have the pizzas done in time and have the stixx come with what they says it does. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, thin crispy crust, generous toppings and served hot. An unexpectedly large variety of draft beer, including the incredibly wonderful Red Oak lager. Service was quick and accurate from a smiling and friendly server.  I will visit this pizza place again on a future visit to Gastonia."}
{"text":"This review is based on the hostess only.  This girl was very rude as we entered the restaurant, told us to just sit anywhere then waited about 5 min before bringing menus and napkins. So we were just sitting there. There was only one other table and a couple people at the bar so I don't know why it took so long. When she finally did bring menus and napkins she just placed them on the table not saying a single word and walked off. So we got up and left.  I am currently sitting in Harper's enjoying great food and impeccable service from all staff members. Never going back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to checkout Brixx.  I had heard some great things about it.  We hit the 6th Street location.  My friends arrived before me and had their beers for 20 minutes.  10 minutes after I arrived, the waiter finally brought me a glass of water, then he flew off before we could order anything.  25 MINUTES later, we finally got his attention to request the bill. We had reached the point of frustration where we were so angry that we didn't want to order anything or give them our business.  The fastest part of the afternoon was when he brought the bill, waited and closed us out.  He did not receive a tip.  I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant in my entire life."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Brixx a week ago... Well It satisfied my hunger, but It didn't satisfy my taste buds.  Pepperoni pizza was mediocre, it was lacking sauce and cheese! C'mon cheese and sauce is what makes pizza!  Hawaiian Pizza, was  eh OK. The crust tasted pretty bland, a bit like cardboard.  $40 for three pizzas, not worth it. Frozen pizza from the Food Lion taste way better!  So, far the best pizza i've had in Charlotte has been in NODA, Revolution!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the hummus platter because you get three different types of hummus (roasted red pepper, black bean, and regular). I usually get pizza - and any of them are good. The beer selection is generally descent and the service is good. Friendly people that don't seem to mind when you ask for special orders."}
{"text":"I went for a week day lunch and ordered the artichoke pizza.  It was a thin crust and generous on the toppings.  If you love to use a wood fired crust as a vehicle for generous ingredient combos then this is the place.   Looking at the menu you couldn't really go wrong.  I forgot to order the wheat crust but will definitely be back to try that out."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, food is great, management is always accomodating and over all a good casual spit to drink some brews and get a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I went with artichoke pizza and pear pizza. Loved both of them. The crust was thin and seasoning was spot on. Ambience is comfortable and it's not very crowded."}
{"text":"Brixx is better since the botox. Not sure why, but I love the patio, pizza and salads. I always order my pizza well-done on the basic crust and could eat almost any of them that they would put in front of me. Beer specials are quite good. TIP: At the end of the year, you can buy discounted gift cards to use all year."}
{"text":"The only place my kids really like to eat out is Brixx, friendly staff, good location and nicely priced.  You can eat inside or out.  We go to the Birkdale location. After we like to walk around Birkdale and get an ice-cream or in the summer you can listen to bands play on the weekend outside!  Great family place, good location and they always try to ad something new to the menu, I love the breadsticks!  Also don't let the long line turn you away, all the time we go there on the weekend we are like # 9 on the list and it goes by super, duper fast!"}
{"text":"Brixx at Birkdale is a great family place to get some pizza and beer.  They have a nice amount of outdoor seating and a lot of friendly staff.  Be casual and have fun."}
{"text":"I lived out of Charlotte for the past five years and Brixx was the first place I went when I moved back! The pizza is so good and they will honor any request!! Toppings are fresh and interesting! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Very good wood fired pizzas, will let you substitute toppings without a hassle.  Not bad considering a lot of competition In Uptown."}
{"text":"For being a pizza-rich town, we've been surprisingly short of wood-fired options. Now all of a sudden there are two, maybe a third on its way in downtown. This one is a franchise and doesn't surprise me that it's a bit mediocre. We tried it out after its first month of being open, figuring the kinks would be shaken out by then. It was a busy football night, but late, after the initial dinner crowd was winding down. We were seated by the hostess then abandoned for about 20 minutes, even though the place was not so busy that all the tables were filled. She was just distracted yakking with a pal. When finally discovered about to leave, we were assigned a harried but competent waitress (who was tipped well for catching up for us). No obvious manager around, and certainly not the type that would pitch in and clean the messed-up bathroom or pick up paper or other droppings on the floor near us.  Anyway, the whole premise of a wood-fired oven seems like false advertising, because it looks like there's a gas flame burning in the back of that oven, with a small pile of wood thrown on the side to dress it up. And the results are not really up to what one expects from this style of preparation. The crust is not as thin and lightly prepared as classic neopolitan, and of the two pizzas we ordered, one was decently charred, the other pale an unfinished. That was the margherita, which can be excused for its drab tomatoes for this region and season, but the cheese should have been closer to a fresh buffala style rather than low moisture and stretchy/chewy.  The appetizers were fine, really enjoyed the hummus and crust \"chips\", and the caesar salad was also fine. But overall this is not the wood-fired pizza destination I wish it would be. Sure, we can't expect a Pizzeria Bianco in this sized town, but something as good as Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana (Henderson NV) should be possible. So far, the best option is actually the Dragonfire pizza truck, but they also have some issues with not quite \"getting it\". But they do have a really good crust going, and you can't go wrong with their basic pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Missed my connecting flight in Charlotte and was told this was a good place for a late night bite and a beer. Completely true. Spot on. Cool atmosphere, good draft selection and tasty, creative pizza. Hit it up"}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a busy Friday night.  We were seated promptly, and our waiter was right over to take our drink order.  We ordered our pizzas, took a little longer than usual to come out, but I think you should expect that anywhere you go on a Friday night in Gastonia.  I ordered the Thai Chicken (which I would definitely recommend), started eating it and realized it really wasn't the Thai Chicken pizza.  We told the manager, he apologized and remade my pizza and was delivered to my table extremely fast.  They even compensated me for the mistake.  Pros:  - quick seating  - good selection of pizza - outdoor seating available - large selection of beers - friendly waitstaff  Cons: - a little chilly inside in the winter months because the door opens right up to the dining area - can be a little loud if the restaurant is full   I always enjoy eating here and will be back!   Ps. Sign up for their newsletter to see their specials!"}
{"text":"Great spot, open late (until 1 am), a good draft beer selection (roughly 15-20) which are discounted heavily on Monday ($2 draft pints), and the pizza wasn't bad at all (I am admittedly very particular about my pizza). Youngish crowd at the brightly lit bar, a better place to mingle with friends than to take a date."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! They have vegan and gluten free options, the staff is always  friendly and attentive. This is a beautiful location and I love the outdoor patio. However, it really bothers me that smoking seems to be allowed on the outdoor patio/eating area.....Cigarette smoke is the last thing I wanna smell while I'm eating!!!! They also have a pitiful dessert menu - i think they only offer one dessert. The appetizers, pizza and sides are great though!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Brixx a few months after opening. For the 2 of us plus an app, drinks, and 2 pizzas, it cost us a bit over $50 with tip. We were not impressed with the food, it was quite flavorless, and the price seem outrageous for what we got and less than mediocre food. Plus our waitress was slow. We waited about 10 minutes after being seated to order. She didn't come back to ask for refills or anything after our food came out. So we also had to track her down to get out check then wait another 10 minutes for her to get it. Safe to say we are not going back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and love their selection of delicious specialty pizzas (the pasta and the salads are tasty too!) But the last time I went I was disappointed by the service. It wasn't very busy, yet our waitress never came back to refill our waters until after our food had been served (about 40 minutes after she brought the initial water), instead she was chatting with other servers. She also got my order wrong, which was disappointing. Overall I love the food and will go back but I was turned off by the service during my last visit. I recommend the spicy pimento bacon pizza or the margherita pizza, both are delicious and made on homemade crust!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't deserve as well as others simply because the service leaves quite a bit to the imagination.  I went with a party of 10, and my pizza was the only one that was burnt. Not a big deal. Except after 15 minutes of waiting on the waitress to come back, a friend had to go get her attention. She didn't ask if I wanted another one or even offer to comp my meal. Instead, she decided to slam the burnt pizza down on the server's station nearby and ignore me the rest of the time. The manager on duty was incredibly nice and even gave my whole group a discount as well as a voucher for me to come back. All I wanted was a fresh pizza, but his generosity made me actually want to come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of Brixx pizza. They have the best spinach and artichoke dip hands down."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. After 10 pm they offer BOGO pizzas, a great deal."}
{"text":"I love love the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza!!  Also the Thai and Buffalo chicken.   Favorite pizza place in the one hour radius for sure!  Great beer on tap selection too."}
{"text":"I like Brixx and eat there often, especially like the patio for people watching in the summer and the 2 for 1 coupons that are easy to come by but I have to say something about the bathrooms. It would be more pleasant taking a leak in the alley behind the restaurant. They smell, and you feel like you're in a dark dank cave with everything being spray painted painted black, kind of gross. ** Restaurant has been renovated including the bathrooms, much nicer now."}
{"text":"Always good to stop in late night for a quick bite.   Much like Cheers where everybody knows your name.  Has to be in my opinion the best staff in South Park.  Always running great specials that are easily accessible via the app.  For a small neighborhood restaurant and bar they always pack a good punch."}
{"text":"This is definitely your standard Brixx. Nothing outside of their regular chains, nor under-par. So for an off-the-cuff pizza place, they did great with their dinner salads. Its a little pricey for drinks ($3 for tea?) and the atmosphere is like a run-down California Pizza Kitchen.   I would go back again if I need a quick bite from a reliable eatery!"}
{"text":"Love the Mexican pizza without chicken!! It's always cooked to perfection. Always satisfied with Brixx"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, tried the cheeseburger pizza. The chicken Alfred is outta this world. Also my first time trying windy hill cider, loved it . Our waitress was the best! She was so nice and looked like a pixie! Nothing like christmas in the summer! Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"I am a foodie and usually am not a huge fan of chains but this place is consistently good. Come here a few times a month with my grandmother, she loves it too. Can't beat their specials and coupons too."}
{"text":"My daughter's soccer team was in Charlotte for the weekend.  We were looking for a restaurant for our team dinner on a Saturday night at 7:00pm, party of 45.  Brixx was more than accommodating.  Service was excellent, food was fantastic and the girls loved the Saturday night Trivia contest.  Highly recommend Brixx, can't wait for the new one to open back home in East Cobb."}
{"text":"I love Brixx but after seeing a cockroach and nicely pulling the lady to the side, they make me wait 50 minutes for two small pizzas that were only supposed take \"10 minutes\". Gotta love cold pizza when it's been sitting there for 40 min and no one bothered to even question it. Thanks Brixx I enjoyed the visit, my pizza is cold and I still tipped you."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to brixx they have catered our office before and the food was always good. The food was just as good at the restaurant. We started off with the pimento cheese appetizer with pita which was great. They could have given a little bit more cheese though. The americano pizza was very good. Over all happy with our experience. Not sure if I'd be quick to return."}
{"text":"I have always loved Brixx! Today I met a friend for lunch and the service was great! The waitress we had was more then accommodating getting our drinks and making sure our glasses were never empty. For some reason Brixx get's it right. No matter the location I can always expect consistency.   Food:  I have so many favorites at Brixx it's always hard to choose what I want. If you've never tried the chicken pene pasta that is a MUST!  Make sure to ask them to add sun-dried tomatoes to the pasta, YUMMY!  Also, my favorite pizza would have to be the pear & gorgonzola: pear, caramelized onions and walnuts. It is a masterpiece for your mouth. Also the spinach and artichoke dip is wonderful! I always ask them to do half crostinis and half warm pita bread. It gives you some variety. The salads are also very fresh and tasty .  This location can be tricky during lunch and dinner time because there is limited parking in the Brixx lot and sometimes you have to park over in the shopping center next door and walk over. Like Nicole said in her review amazing patio area. Also, close enough to uptown off east blvd and scott that you won't have to worry that much about going past that hour lunch time."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the bronx bomber and the chilli they offer both great choices ! I eat here alot and it never fails to disappoint .. great salads the server knows my favorite \"supreme like\" pizza ... they always give me healthy suggestions and alternatives to try. I love it. Very convenient and quick.. great atmosphere.  Some of the lunch staff could do a better job with timeliness and checking on the customers."}
{"text":"Spoke with a self appointed \"big cheese\" at the East Boulevard location. He did not agree that Wifi for customers was a good idea. He thought they would \"stay too long\". It'll be Hawthorne's from now on guys. You blew it."}
{"text":"I come in at least once a week for beer, pizza, and sports. I recommend half BBQ and half Buffalo Chicken pizza. They also offer wheat dough and have different drink specials depending on the day. It's the perfect place for dad to grab a beer while the family enjoys some pizzas to share. Great variety of craft beer. Wish they had Triple C Golden Ale on draft but now I'm just being greedy. Awesome staff, shoutout to bartender Chris who held onto a Northface I left there one night, the bartenders literally have you covered. Thanks for being a great dinner option any night of the week."}
{"text":"I love Brixx -- you must try the mozzarella and tomato sandwich!  It's great, and so are the salads, and everything is very reasonably priced.  I always enjoy lunch on the patio at any Brixx location."}
{"text":"The Bruschetta is excellent! The pizza is pretty good, too. Plenty of local brews to choose from."}
{"text":"Where to start ? The food is bad and overpriced,, I love pizza and will gladly pay extra for great pie butt. Brixx is not the case!"}
{"text":"Started with the triple hummus platter with pita triangles and then had the Chicken Florentine pizza w/o feta; they were both incredible.  The food was worth the wait; it was super busy in here! Customer service was also excellent."}
{"text":"The menu seemed run of the mill for a pizza place, but then again, there are only so many combinations of pizza toppings you can have. The thing that makes this place better than others is their willingness to sub regular cheese with vegan cheese. A huge plus for two traveling vegans.  The beer list was better than most pizza places I've been too. Very nice selection.  I just wish this place had a location back home in Florida."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town, the New York in me love thin crust pizzas. The service here is always amazing! Ed is our favorite for sure he's amazing"}
{"text":"Hard to decide between two and three stars.   Went to meet a colleague after work, so we didnt eat. Decent beer selection, service was quick (not a lot of people in there), but the place is DIRTY.   It looks pretty neat when you walk in, but as we sat down at one of the booths, we started to notice how dusty it was, especially in the ceiling, not appetizing.   Would consider visiting again, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"My favorite Brixx within 10 mile radius of downtown.  Really good wait and bar staff. This spot has a nice outdoor space and is a pleasant place watch games inside. I enjoyed watching some of the March Madness games at this location. They have excellent wood fired pizzas, salads, and pastas. They have an excellent selection of craft beers.  They usually have a couple you don't find elsewhere. I do like this location better than East Blvd and 7th Street Station."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some pizza after being reminded that Brixx was an option from the Sunday paper insert. I like the menu, lots of good choices.  Typically it looks like people order personal size pizzas which is nice because you can get what you want.  I ordered a grilled veggie pizza with sausage on it.  The service was excellent, the pizza pretty darn good, and a good selection of beers.  Nice place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to Brixx, it is one of the most consistent places I have ever been to. I have tried most of the menu and I have never been dissatisfied with anything. The appetizers are great, especially the spinach and artichoke dip. The salads are fresh and delicious. The Brixx salad is a must with pine nuts and goat cheese. The pizzas are crunchy and thin with a great selection of toppings. I particularly enjoy the Bronx Bomber and the Margarita pizza. I also like their sandwiches and side dishes but I rarely ever eat them because its hard not to order one of their delicious pizzas. They also have a great selection of beer and have a different special every night."}
{"text":"Boom! Brixx Pizza is hands down the best over fired pizza in town (I have tried so far).   Yes it's a chain. Yes it's small building. But they bring a big game. With a simple menu and fresh atmosphere they have a fun vibe. Most anyone can't eat here. They have healthy options and full fatty pizzas.   We have gone 5 times now! Out of all those times Sam has been out server at least 3. He was honest, helpful, friendly, fast and just all around a great server.   One time we went and the kitchen was having a struggle bus day. They messed up both our pizzas! Mine was remade once and still they forgot the goat cheese. My husbands was remade 4 TIMES And still wasn't right... We ordered menus items with no customization, so I think the kitchen was just having a bad day. They were very nice about it and so where we. The manager was there that day, but we didn't talk to him.   I have tried almost all the meat free options and all are amazing! My husband loves the 4x4, which is sauce free, but surprisingly good. They make the mozzarella in house and it's so good!!!   The beer selection is pretty good too. We trie the root beer on tap too. I would highly recommend that!   Give them a try and get your pizza fix at Brixx."}
{"text":"The pizza is consistently ok, the beer plentiful, service generally friendly, and they allow dogs on the patio rain or shine. We like the BBQ chicken pizza and the pesto. The quattro formagio and the mushroom pizzas are both fine though a bit bland. I love that pizzas is fairly thin, but would prefer that is have a bit more flavor and less raw flour or cornmeal stuck to the crust.   The Brixx salad is a winner for lunch if you aren't in the mood for pizza. Also, pizza is BOGO after 10 during the week and 11 on weekends.  This Brixx is incredibly convenient for those of us living in Dilworth condos. For that reason alone, we are regulars."}
{"text":"Brixx is such a good value, and the pizza is amazing.  You can add anything to any pizza and customize them however you like with no extra charge. The service is fast and friendly. The food comes out fresh, quick, and hot. Brixx, bringing people together."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!  Dont even compare to pizza hut or dominos.     They have the best thin crust pizzas, also some great salads!!!    Price is real good too!"}
{"text":"Brixx is consistently one of the best pizza places in town.  All of their locations is good but the Birkdale atmosphere helps make this the best.  Great beer selection and italian dishes if you do not care for pizza.  Salads are the best around for lunch."}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased. I was expecting more from this merchant. The pizza was slightly warm, not hot. But it was somewhat tasty, not great. I then looked up the calorie/fat content of the Bronx Pizza I ordered and was shocked to find out it had a whopping 1480 calories and 88 grams of fat. Looks like they are not into health. But the main reason I rated them only 3 stars was because the pizza was only warm served, not hot."}
{"text":"Pizza was good , but tiramisu was horrible  , me and my Roomie had food poisoning today ."}
{"text":"Brixx has great food in a fabulous atmosphere... and the waitstaff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Cold meatballs on the meatball sandwich - and no offer of doing something special or better. Typical Gastonia service."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere is actually really nice. But the food is just not good at all. We got the bruchetta and bread sticks for appetizers. The bruchetta had hardly any balsamic on it but at least looked nice. The bread sticks were utterly flavorless. They were served with marinara and honey mustard sauces. The marinara tasted like straight up tomato sauce. Then we got two veggie pizzas with their normal crust - the bread and sauce just the same as the bread sticks. It was like having ketchup on sandwich bread with warm veggies on it. Totally not going back."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend here and the entire place has been remodeled since my last visit.  I liked all the changes.  We each had pizza, but, I am very picky.  I have to say the waitress gave my different idea's until I chose one.  It turned out to be very, very good.  It is a small place so I wouldn't advise you to go here for any piece and quiet.  Very family oriented and very loud at times.  The food and service was excellent.  S. Cooper"}
{"text":"Pretty good food at an acceptable price. They seem to have a good beer selection too. The server was very friendly and responsive. Good place."}
{"text":"Brixx is a good spot.  This one is located nicely in the center of Birkdale Village.  They have a pretty good beer selection, tasty appetizers and, of course, some good pizzas.  At this location, the service was alright as well."}
{"text":"I love the thin crust pizzas here. They always seem healthy and are very tasty. I rarely leave feeling regret for eating too much pizza. The salads are also delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very desperate for food on Friday night after making the 6-hour trek from NoVA to the Charlotte area. Once we checked into our hotel, we rested a bit. Took the suggestion of a friend to go to Brixx for pizza. That was the best suggestion of the evening!!  What I liked - all of the pizza combos on the menu! They have 10\" \"personal\" pizzas, but we split one and had the Mediterranean salads each. Yum! Add to that, Pumpkin Ale!! Never had it - now I'm a huge fan!!   The service was so friendly and attentive - I loved the experience here! I wish they had this \"chain\" in NoVA!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why there is always a crowd. The whole wheat pizza crust was soggy and tasteless. The gluten free pizza, well, don't even bother to order it.   The only bright spot was my son's grilled chicken sandwich. We won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"If you think Brixx is good pizza then you have never had good pizza. The crust is bland and some how manages to be dense and chewy despite being thin. One question has bugged each time I have gone to any a Brixx location; how are they allowed to call themselves \"wood-fired\" when THERE IS NO WOOD in the place?? Even for the pizza waste land that is Charlotte, Brixx is disappointing.  The one saving grace may be the drink menu. There is a variety of beer and an om wine list. Specials are not great but prices on the list are reasonable."}
{"text":"Best service at any restaurant in town!  Jared was our server and he did an excellent job taking caring of us!  We got the spinach and artichoke dip, 4x4 pizza and the spicy shrimp pizza.  Everything was very good!! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and not overly seasoned. However, there wasn't much spice to it.  I didn't mind because I don't like too much heat, but my boyfriend thought it could have used more.  Overall we still very much liked it.   It was our first time tonight, but we will definitely be back.  I don't normally write yelp reviews; in fact this is my first yelp review.   I was compelled to write a review for Brixx because the food and service is great and it definitely warrants more than 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Drinks selection and service were good but the food left much to be desired. My pizza was more dough than cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"Have been twice in the past week - always good food. Love the Brixx salad with chicken and the pear/Gorgonzola pizza. Service from both our servers both nights was top knotch! Always quick, polite, helpful and friendly. Told server about a favorite summer drink from another restaurant that was similar to one on Brixx's menu, but not quite the same... and they recreated it at the bar which was awesome! Only place that could use an improvement is the host/hostess stand, but it's high schoolers so what do you expect. ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and an even better staff. I typically eat here about once a week. The also have great beer specials."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends and had a not so good experience. My salad was o.k.(great dressing!) but VERY small. Not worth the price. My friends both got pizza - one said hers was good the other said fair. Neither ate all theirs or asked for a take home box.   The major negative was the wait time. We were seated and given menus. After 10 - 15 minutes someone asked if anyone had taken our order... no.... she said she would get our waiter. Another 10 or so minutes....still no waiter. We finally tracked down the first girl and she agreed to take our order. There is really no excuse for waiting for 20-30 minutes to get a beer and have your order taken."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great beer options. Plenty of tv sports. Quality is high. Free table Pacman."}
{"text":"When in Doubt, we go to Brixx. The Hummus trio is a must try, the spinach artichoke dip is amazing and they have the best pizzas in town. I am a vegetarian and I cannot think of a more vegetarian friendly restaurant in North Charlotte than Brixx. The wait staff are very friendly and the prices are reasonable. No complaints about this place."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:50pm & was quickly greeted & seated! We were given the allergen list to see what vegan items we could order which was very kind of the host! Great service by Erick who was kind & always smiling. He checked in with us several times to make sure we were happy with our food. He was very busy tending several tables but his service was still very nice. We ordered the hummus trio (Vegan) & a veggie pizza with pineapple & vegan cheese (all vegan). It was delicious & came out very quickly. We ate & were out of there in less than 35 mins. The staff was all very friendly! Bathrooms were very clean & had a diaper changing area for babies in each of the two gender neutral bathrooms which is always a plus & I wish more places offered that. (Dads change diapers too!)"}
{"text":"I'm familiar with Brixx from living and working in Charlotte.  Recently moved out to Gaston County and was very excited to hear Gastonia was getting a Brixx!  The food is always good and they have a great beer selection.  I normally get the Broxx Bomber and a Hummus appetizer.  I wish I could learn to make hummus as well as Brixx does.  And the pizza is always spot on.  Atmosphere is fun and relaxed.  We have a kid, and he loves writting on the chalk wall.  We really appreciate this diversion while we wait for our order.  In the beginning, we had a few small problems with service, but nothing so bad to turn us off.  Figured it was a new staff and new store learning and working out the kinks.  Last few times we've been service has been spot on.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for good, well-priced pizza and a good pint!"}
{"text":"The pizzas my husband and I ordered were mediocre.  They were pretty greasy and I had the impression they had been sitting around for a while and just heated up before they were brought out to us.  I think this place is overpriced for the quality of food they serve.  The waitstaff was attentive.  I don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty flavorless, but not horrible.  You could do worse, but I wouldn't choose Brixx again. The service is the real reason for my rating.  Our waiter was actually quite good, it's everyone else we encountered that was the problem.    It's been two years since we've been here and I remember why. The restaurant is quite small and awkwardly situated. We arrived at 5:20 on a Sat and they were already running a wait. Watching the staff work, it's no mystery why. They appear to not have bus staff. The three teenage hostesses are also responsible for bussing. They have neither bus tubs or trays. They bus the tables by hand. Pick up two glasses, walk to the back, gather napkins, walk to the back, two plates, walk to the back...you get the idea. Then they search for a rag to clean the top, search for the cleaner...ugh!  Forget cleaning the floor.  Our already double seated waiter swept his own station, which was very messy from a recently departed kids party, while the hostesses chatted.  Watching these kids run the show was painful.   When our appetizer arrived, the runner just stared at our table waiting for us to move things around and make space. She brought no plates. Those came five mins later.  When the pizza arrived, the runner ( another person) set the food down but did not clear the appetizer dishes, even though it was clear we were finished. The hostesses stood by in clear site and picked up nothing. Finally our server (he was the only staff of the night I wouldn't fire), came for them.  I'm not sure who the manager of this place is, but the staff needs a lot of training!!  I'm guessing this place stays in business because of the location, because I can't think of another reason."}
{"text":"We went for the first time this afternoon (about 12:30 pm on a Sunday) and had a wonderful experience. Our waitress was attentive and our drinks never ran dry. The bartender came to check on our drinks and also refilled as needed. Everyone was helpful and nice. Our kids each got a kids pizza meal and loved theirs. We tried a 4x4 pizza and the Bronx Bomb (I think) and both were great and full of flavor. For appetizers, we got Brixx stixx and bruschetta. I loved the bruschetta topping - it was perfectly flavored with large tomatoes. We will definitely return. We got 2 kids meals, one pizza, 2 appetizers, and 2 soft drinks and our total before tip was $42 which we felt was fair. We left with extra pizza as well."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is great. Service, food, ambience are all good.   This time we thought we would change it up and sit at a booth, normally we are at the bar, and enjoy a nice meal. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which was fabulous, however the artichoke parts could have been a bit smaller for easier application to the crostinis.  We then ordered roasted chicken  penne and Italian beef sandwich. The penne was ok but basically tasted like green bell pepper and pasta. In my experience, the green bell pepper over powers a lot. I think changing this dish with red, yellow, and/or orange would be better along with shredding the chicken. The sandwich was great and a unique change to the standard fare; however the au jus was saltierthan expected.  Overall, this place is great. Service has always been exceptional in my book. We just happened to try different foods this time. We will definitely return and try different items an, if course, enjoy a ice cold local brew."}
{"text":"3 stars because I don't want to hurt the overall appearance on Yelp. To be fair, I did not eat anything on this recent visit. I came with my mother, sister and her husband.  THE TRUTH: This deserves one star, if that. This hurts my heart. I loved it here when I came as a child. Somehow things have changed. My sister's husband never got another beer, though he asked. It took nearly an hour to get one pizza and one salad. It was not busy, however, there were tons of people coming in for takeout. It seems like the dine-in guests were put on the back burner. My sister's buffalo chicken pizza had no buffalo sauce. My mother's salad was the size of a side salad. Our waitress was not friendly and did not refill our drinks and took a very long time to get the check. Sad to see a place I loved so much fall to a subpar restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little pizza! The wraps are also really good and I believe they are made with the pizza dough. Yum!  We've always had good service and today was no exception."}
{"text":"Brixx Pizza is very tasty. Try the 2 for 1 special after 10:00 p.m. M-TH."}
{"text":"The first time I've ever been to a Brixx was maybe about 3 years ago? I enjoyed it at the Gastonia location, so I also decided to introduce Brixx to my fiancé because he was interested. I did my research like I always do before I eat out... Call me crazy, but I rather be safe than sorry. So I was randomly craving it. Let me start by... I knew of the locations, but I wasn't really sure of the where exactly? We didn't get lost or anything, but finding it was really confusing, so you had to pay close attention!!! To get to the shopping center you have to make a U turn to get into it and the fact that it was super dark it didn't help! So it was kind of like getting a lost in a small ghost town. I was starting to think that the Brixx Pizza place didn't exist, but like I said... the location was really confusing. We finally found the place after 5 minutes, it was all the way in the back at the awkward shopping center to where I was starting think we were going to end up where the dumpsters are usually located. The parking lot was so small and dark, I was scared to get out of the car because it looked \"sketchy.\" So we entered inside the place looking everywhere trying to find the host, and everyone just looked at us like we were crazy? There wasn't anyone to direct us, as we finally found the hosts after looking like deers staring at headlights, we told them we were confused of the directions because apparently the side where we parked was the back! And there was supposedly a special way to enter. They just stared at my fiancé and I like we stupid, so it was a awkward start... we were seated at the seats and the waitress was great! So that was the only good thing about our experience. My fiancé ordered the garlic breadsticks and said it shouldn't be called \"garlic bread\" because there wasn't any lick of garlic taste in the breadstick and I ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza which I thought I was pretty bland. Honestly when doing research, they had a thing called \"Ernest Hemingway\" which was a non-alcoholic mojito and wasn't even at the location was  a bummer. I might come back, but not this location."}
{"text":"Brixx is our go to place for pizza and brews. Lately we have been dinning there on a weekly basis. However, today was a different story.  My husband suggested that we head over to Brixx in Huntersville to celebrate my birthday. I arrived first and put our name on the list. I was surprised there was a wait on a Monday night at 8:00 PM. The hostess said it would be 20 to 25 minutes. I looked around and saw 5 just emptied tables waiting to be cleaned, so I gave her my name.   At 8:14 she came out and got the four of us. She took us to a table in the back which was not going to work. We had passed 2 booths that were empty and waiting to be cleaned. I asked her for the larger of the 2 booths and she told me that there was someone sitting there, which was not true. She said she would clean the round booth for us.   When I walked to the front, the waitress started to clean the larger booth and told us she would have it ready in a minute. Meanwhile the hostess walked away from the round booth. The waitress took all the dirty dishes and trash from the large booth and placed on the round booth. After wiping the booth down she walked away.   My husband went and found the hostess and asked if we could sit at the now clean big booth. She told him \"NO\". At that point I walked out and went home. Thanks for a lovely birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"This location has been my \"go to\" for 6 years. It's taken way too long to rate. Great, friendly staff and food is always on point. Thank you Brixx for a consistently awesome experience. 2 for 1 late night pies don't hurt either.!"}
{"text":"I love this Brixx! Although the food is no different from their other locations, this East Blvd spot is so much more cozy and inviting!  Patio seating is perfect on a warm night.  Extra patio kudos for the space being dog friendly!  And I've never had any problems with the service, ever.  The pizzas are slightly overpriced... but after 10pm pizzas and appetizers are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE! (make sure you mention this to your server!) Brixx also has BOGO coupons everywhere! Citipass book, back of the Yellow Pages book, newpaper inserts, etc.  Menu is very vegetarian friendly! You can even get vegan cheese and whole wheat crust if you so desire. Both types of crusts are thin, wood-fired, and crispy; which makes them super light. Don't let the size of the pie fool you... if you're hungry, one person can take out an entire pizza! (or even if you're just in love with how perfect and delicious it is, in my case).  Appetizers: Spinach and Artichoke Dip is outta control good. It's even got a little zip to it. I substitute the crostinti for pita bread. The Bruschetta is good, although not my favorite in town. \"Wood Fired Pita Chips and Three Dips\" is really, really yummy. This is basically 3 different types of hummus (traditional, roasted red pepper, and black bean). Mmmm.  Salads: The first salad I tried here was the Brixx Salad, and it's so perfect I've never even bothered with anything else. Mixed greens, pistachios, goat cheese, croutons, balsamic vinegerette, and a hunk of house-mouse rosemary focaccia. Heads up, you can order a half-size for half-price!   Pizzas: The best part. I'd first like to mention that Brixx is so awesome that you can get these little pizzas half-and-half if you can't decide on what style you want, or want to split it with someone else.   My go-to is the Quattro Formaggio (mozzarella, parmesan, gouda and goat cheeses with sun-dried tomatoes) and then I add feta for good measure. Does that make it Cinco Formaggio?  Pear & Gorgonzola: !!!!! sliced pear, mozzarella, gorgonzola and caramelized onions topped with toasted walnuts!!!!!!  Greek: roma tomatoes, kalamata olives, red onions, and feta cheese topped with fresh basil and balsamic glaze drizzle.  Decent beer on tap selection here!   Open late (1am) when almost everything else in Charlotte is closed!"}
{"text":"Last time I went the service was ok, not especially personable and I felt that it took too long for the food to arrive. If this was dinner it would have been fine but because I was there on a lunch break I was tapping my foot waiting for the food to arrive.   I had the Americo. It wasn't bad. I like the wood fired style pizza, good flavor overall. I've had some of the less traditional pizzas before like the bourbon chicken. I'd recommend just getting something like the Americo, the bourbon chicken sounds great on paper but in reality it's pretty bland.   Been going to Brixx for years, it's always decent. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Many, many kudos for all of your always delicious pizzas and bubbly brews, Brixx. We had a bitchy waitress who was trying to go home the entire time she was serving us, but the food was so good- I didn't even care.    Went on Friday for the late night buy one get one free deal (after 10pm).  Hummus plate, spinach artichoke dip, pear gorgonzola pizza, and spicy shrimp pizza.  Several rounds of ice cold Sam Adams for $2.50.  Sigh.  My quest for comparable pizza in Seattle continues as I have been spoiled by you bastards.   You delicious bastards."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Wasn't very busy, but it was 1:30. Got the spicy shrimp pizza with wheat crust. Was pretty tasty. Wish it was a hassle spicier, but I understand not everyone likes as much spice as I do. Over all was good. Sure I'll come back."}
{"text":"Easy to get in and out for lunch! Great pizza! Weekends and evenings can get busy but overall it's a good place to eat. The space is a little tight is the only downside!"}
{"text":"Split a turkey and rye Sammy and a bowl of chili with the hubs and it was more than enough. Delish. I gotta go back for the sweets, they look spectacular."}
{"text":"The beer selection is wonderful, including some great local brews.  Sadly it was 11:30am on a Thursday so we couldn't partake.    I had the Chicken Florentine pizza. It was missing some zing, I found it rather bland, but I'm a sucker for anything involving feta.    My boyfriend had the chipotle bbq chicken and loved it."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of pizza, however,  I am married to a pizza lover so finding a pizza place in our new town is on top of our list. Thankfully as a good yelper, I search for a good place here and thankfully I found great reviews on this place. It is definitely everything everybody says and more. The food is delicious, the location is great ad the service is good. I can totally see myself craving pizza from this place."}
{"text":"Got in from Maryland around 10pm. And this was the only place open. They have a great casual vibe. Good beer selection and awesome pizza. Try the Mexican pizza! Delicious!! And one pizza was big enough for my BF and I. Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed dining at the Brixx in South Charlotte and were excited that one was opening in Fort Mill. We went for lunch yesterday in celebration of my husband's birthday. Our food was delivered quickly. My Arugula\Pear salad was full of goat cheese, cranberries and pecans. The pizza was hot and tasty. The caramel cookie dessert is one of the best desserts around! The only negative was that we had to ask for drink refills. We will definitely return to this Brixx!"}
{"text":"Bad food! Bad portions! Poor service!  Quality is aweful. Management is cheap.  $6.00 beer with pizzas that taste like Dijorno or Ref Baron.   By all means keep going back hoping it gets good again."}
{"text":"Great gluten free place to go.   Lots of freshness!  Amazing freshness of the ingredients"}
{"text":"Great family friendly location. Nice selection of craft beers on tap and bottle. The quality of the pizza is consistent and taste is very good. Service is generally friendly and efficient.  The bar area is a nice spot for a quick bite and drink while shopping in the area. Good patio area when the weather is nice for people watching and soaking in some sun.  My kids love the pizza and I like the beer selection. Many TV's around as well to catch a game while your there."}
{"text":"I had no problem finding a parking place on the Brixx side of the parking lot.  It was clean and really nice inside.  The server was super nice as was the host.  I ordered the Americano pizza which is just pepperoni and mushroom.  I thought it was good but not fantastic.  I would go back."}
{"text":"The wood fired pizza selection here is great and well priced!  This also may be the only pizza place I've been to that does not have wings! :(  PROTIP: They do not charge for extra toppings, so pick a pizza you like and build it however you want!"}
{"text":"I came here a lot growing up and it was always pretty good. I went tonight for the first time in a few years and I will never be back. It was a Saturday night and decently busy, but there were open tables and no one was waiting the whole time we were there. It took almost 10 minutes just to get waters. And we ordered a salad and 1 pizza and waited almost a full hour for them to arrive. Oh and my BUFFALO chicken pizza had NO buffalo sauce on it at all. It was bread cheese chicken and celery. Horrible."}
{"text":"I had a very distasteful experience. The food was not that good below average and also the service was not very good. No one smiled and everyone was very slow and lethargic. I hate to sound so mean but I'm just being honest. Other than that the building looked niv"}
{"text":"Not a very good place to eat in my opinion. Honestly the foods not good and service is less than average ."}
{"text":"Crispy flat crust, fresh tasting ingredients.  Artichoke/pesto/tomato pizza was excellent, highly recommended for the veggie minded or the plain old I like a tasty slice of pizza minded.  The chicken/sun dried tomato pizza was just ok.  And DO get a beer sampler - $4.50 for I think it was five samples of brew, which can be a steal if you pick your brews well.  Overall it totals up to over a pint. They had great Oktoberfest choices and several options of the wheat, pale, and hoppy variety (ahhh)."}
{"text":"My reasons for a 5 star review are two-fold... 1. The pizza and salad at Brixx are consistently well made, fresh, and delicious!  I'm never disappointed; but the REAL reason for my review of the Uptown Brixx today is 2. the Catering service!  Casey Offerman is the catering manager... today, I called him at 12:30 for enough pizza to feed lunch to the 40 people in my office... I ordered 24 pizzas and salad for all... They arrived here within 30 minutes with hot pizza, cold salad, napkins, plates, and smiles!  AMAZINGLY fast and reliable service.  This is not the first time I have laid a last minute mid-week lunch on them either... they are always this fast and always this wonderful to work with!"}
{"text":"I'd like to say it's a relative thing (I've had LOTS of really good and different types of pizza) but this was an ABSOLUTE thing - just really bad.  We had two pizzas - a classic (it was fine) and a new-age (Buffalo chicken).  The problems: crust had zero flavor, the ingredients covered MAYBE 30% of the surface and maybe that was a good thing because they too lacked any real flavor.  And then there was the service - incredible slow with lots of excuses (sorry - the bar got really crazy....and there was nothing crazy about it).  The only thing good was the above par beer list which we were forced to wait FOREVER to get our beer.  Bizarre.  DON\"T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of wine and beer. Comfortable atmosphere and fresh food which makes a huge difference in taste.  Thin and crispy California style pizza. Definitely worth a stop!  Wish I had been here Sunday night for the half price wine bottles.  Attending a convention this week and looking forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"Average to mediocre pizza.  I had a beer and the Bronx Bomber and never tasted a pizza this salty before.  And if the oven is wood fired they are doing it a grave injustice with the dough they use for the crust. It was sort of pasty white and bland with absolutely no character to it.  I know it is my personal bias but I prefer a crust that has some big air bubbles and an oven hot enough to char it just a bit   All in all I was disappointed by the food.  The two stars are because of the good service."}
{"text":"Kelly was an awesome server/bartender, the 4x4 pizza with tomato sauce was outstanding and the cold zombies really hit the spot. Topped it off with a melt in the mouth warm salted caramel cookie. The very generous military discount was almost as good as the food. I'll be back the next time I'm passing through."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the pizza at Brixx! Yet another place I have been to a dozen times but have neglected to review. The pizza is consistently good, but some are better than others.   My top 3:  BBQ Chicken - a classic that Brixx does better by adding fresh cilantro and gouda. I often pass it up in favor in trying something more \"unique\" but always end up wishing I had ordering this.  Sweet Thai Chicken - If you are not into the mixing of sweet and spicy, this pie is not for you. Otherwise, mangia! The flavors are intense and delicious! Under the spice is the slightest hint of sweet. Underneath the sweet is a finishing peanut flavor. This is the pizza we always order when introducing people to Brixx.  Pear & Gorganzola - I must admit, this was a hard sell for me, but I am glad that my fiancée talked me into it. The pears and caramelized onions make for a perfect pairing. And the walnuts add a surprisingly satisfying texture.  The 2 I could do without:  Spicy Shrimp - All I taste in this pie is spice. The kind of spice that sets your lips on fire. I don't mind that if there is good flavor mixed in, but the shrimp comes across as not having any flavor.  Bourbon Chicken - Not enough flavor. I was so excited to try this and was very disappointed by its blandness.  All of the others fall somewhere in between and are worth a shot if the description appeals to you.  I gave 3 stars because, while their pizza is great, their other menu selections are not. The two sandwiches I have tried (Pesto Chicken Salad Wrap & Roasted Chicken Club) were mediocre. The starters are also not anything to write home about. Perhaps that is why they offer one free when you check in on the app..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about Brixx is that it's open till 1am. And, even better, the service doesn't worsen as late night hours arrive. I'm not a drinker, but Brixx is a great place to have a few drinks, watch games and enjoy good oven cooked pizza.   The folks here use real toppings that taste fresh and they aren't shy about putting lots on. The pizza here is pretty darn good as was my Brixx small salad, which was filled with fresh leafy lettuce and veggies.   At this time of night, good luck finding a better place with quality food and good service."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, open late, and great specials. After 10pm it's buy one get one free pizza and that includes weekends. Amazing! My favorite so far has been the Hawaiian but added jalapeño and sauce which was phenomenal. Very friendly staff. Great location. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Brix, this one was not up to par. I got the fettuccine Alfredo. The bread was also dry. I'm not sure if it was an off night or what.   My friend got a cheese pizza and also thought it was terrible, so sadly I'm not sure if I'm going back."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place. My family came to visit from out of town and requested we go here for lunch. We dread going out to eat with our 2yo and 4yo. Very kid friendly!!! Dough to play with then cook, crayons and chalkboards at some booths. Gluten free dough and vegan cheese ....we can finally take my 4yo out for pizza!!!!!!  Love the lunch special and lunch punch card is such an awesome deal! Everything we have ordered has been great. The Mediterranean salad was outstanding! Great outdoor seating area. Lots of great craft brews, from many Illinois breweries! Great drink specials every day of the week. Unlike most places that don't have specials on Friday and Saturdays. Would be a great late night place to go also, bc they have some good specials after 10pm! Food has been out super fast, which is very important with 3 littles. Great service every time we have been there. Charity was our server on our last 2 visits."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily inconsistent. Ordered three pizzas to go this week. Two literally had four inches between the edge of the pizzas and where the toppings started. Paid $10 a piece for a crust!  Sent a note to the manager through Brixx's website...  Several days later, still no response.   Save your money."}
{"text":"The service was awful. Our waiter came up and said \"what do you want\" didn't introduce himself or anything. The staff was leaning on our booth talking while we are trying to eat. It gets worse. The manager was walking around with food in his mouth talking and the food flying out. One of the staff was shooting cleaning supply's towards the manager in the direction of the table. Call me crazy but I don't like food with a side of chemicals, also had an empty glass and 6 waiters at the bar talking to each other looking at our glass and no refill. So disappointing cause the food was good but the service was a joke. It was the whole staffs actions not just one bad server."}
{"text":"Best salads in town which complement well with there amazing pizzas. Great clean place to take the family."}
{"text":"Love this place ....but not for the pizza. I go for their yummy salads!!! The salad with the pears is my go to with extra dressing. Throw a piece of salmon on there and you're all set. I've actually never had the pizza. Service has always been fast. Kids seems to like the  pizza."}
{"text":"Brixx has some great selections if you know what to order. Their sandwiches can be so-so although I've ordered my fair share and my first week in Charlotte they were a major comfort (Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich). Their salads are pretty nice but their pizza- yum! I've tried all the veggie oriented varieties except the Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza which is next on my list. The location is perfect for when you're wandering uptown, maybe perusing the library, and hunger suddenly strikes. If you're looking for a cheap slice, you may want to go to Fuel, but if you're looking for something more enjoyable, try Brixx.   One drawback to Brixx... there is smoking inside, at least the last time I was at this location which has been awhile."}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick Bite or to even have a fully relaxing meal. Also a great place to go after work for drinks or even late night drunks they are open till 1 and offer BOGO pizza. Ask for Andrew as your server and tell him John from NYC Sent you and you will get world class treatment"}
{"text":"Sorry but I've tried this place twice. It's a typical wanna be south Park rich people crowd especially after work. And the staff as well as the waiters are pretty rude. I actually had to yell at one of them because they reached over me 3 times. I let it go the first two times because I was trying to have a good time. But the third just got to me."}
{"text":"We have our usuals at Brixx and it's absolutely amazing  everytime. Me and my boys give it a 5 Rea road crew rocks especially my favorite bartender! Thanks"}
{"text":"This is the first coal/wood fired pizza joint that has disappointed me. I had the  Wild Mushroom that is described as having 3 kinds of mushrooms, an olive oil base, mozzarella, shaved parm and arugula.   I first noticed that the crust lacked flavor and texture. Come on, these are what high temperature ovens are all about. The mushrooms were not \"wild\" at all. They too lacked flavor and the shiitake, portobello and buttons were indistinguishable between each other. The olive oil base was non existent, so it was one dry pie. However, the arugula was fresh and plentiful! (Stop the world!)(eye roll)  My guess is that this joint gets their ingredients on the cheap and is all about the bottom line and couldn't care less about food quality.  What an epic flop of a meal."}
{"text":"My wife picked us up some Brix to go.  After entering the establishment a line cook proceeded to cat call at her from the line.  This not only made my wife uncomfortable, but also upset her.  The guy continued and all this was occurring right in front of the manager who proceeded to do nothing.  The food was ok.  The artichoke/spinach dip tasted ok but looked horrible.  I was not impressed with the pizza.  With 10+ years of restaurant experience, I continue to be blown away at how poorly franchises are run."}
{"text":"I came here on a night free during a conference and it was great. Great service, staff, pizza, and beer selection. I came back a few days later and had the same great experience."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good service.  Please note:  former review is a butt review (just like a butt dial)."}
{"text":"The experience was excellent! My family had a great time and the service  was prompt. We didn't have to even look around to have our drinks refilled. I'm not from Charlotte and the location was a little hectic to get to, but ultimately I would go there again whenever I am back in the area."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza we ordered was mediocre at best.  The crust wasn't outstanding and the cheese was rubbery.  The tomatoes on the bruschetta, on the other hand, were fresh and flavorful.  I could taste the garlic and olive oil.  It was a shame that the toast it came on was as stale as the day is long....  I have had better pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"What happened to this long time, very favorite restaurant?? Pasta order was completely wrong, horrible, and the accompanying bread was stale, flat, greasy and gross. The pizzas had about a third of the toppings they should have, were undercooked but yet the crust was like cardboard, tasted stale and I'd guess reused. 2nd awful visit in a row. Feels like a place where the next time you drive by it's out of business. That certainly would not surprise me."}
{"text":"Made my first visit to Brixx this past Friday night. Boy, it was a madhouse! Very loud and very limited seating inside. I managed to get an inside table thanks to a large group leaving eventually. The pizza I ordered was ok. Nothing too memorable though. My waiter was great though."}
{"text":"Dropped into Brixx as it was close to our hotel in Charlotte.  I had previously been to other Brixx pizza locations, the pizzas we ordered were good.  We got the margherita pizza and the buffalo pizza. The service was good and fast. The facility is large, and was about 20% full during our time here.   Overall a good, quick place to stop by and grab a brick oven pizza while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went twice recently..1st time was on Presidents Day..Well, Mondays is $1.95 Domestic Pints !!!  5 STARS FOR THIS ALONE!!!! Service very friendly, Great for kids as they get a piece of raw pizza dough to play with, my granddaughter Loved that!  Did I mention $1.95 Drafts on Monday? ALL DAY ????   While the pizza isn't authentic NY style or Chicago deep dish or wood fired like my favorite pizza in Croatia or Italy, it's just right for washing the $1.95 PINTS down!!! Soup was good also.  I will be back..Hopefully on a Monday!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and always love to go back. The pizza is excellent, especially if you like the artisan-ish type without grease puddles and with fresh ingredients. I know some people have negatively reviewed the pizza here, but I have to thoroughly disagree with that.   The beer selection is great, dozens of craft beers on draft. Create a sampler there! It's good value with regards to the amount The environment is nice, I feel comfortable here, and our waiters have always been great."}
{"text":"I wasn't aware that I had ordered a side of judgment with my pizza. Pleasant experience upon arriving, sat down and the service was quick. After finishing one glass of wine, the waitress immediately came over and took my glass away, without asking if I wanted another- I had to call her back over to order another glass. After three glasses (we were there for quite a bit watching a football game), the waitress brought over the check, without us asking for it and without us telling her if we were done or not. Then on top of all that, the waitress looks at the bottle my mom had been drinking (it was half priced bottle night, so we figured getting a bottle would be cheaper than three drinks), holds it up, inspects the half bottle remaining, and comments \"oh, you did a good job too. Would you all like water- to-go?\" Sad experience because I actually did enjoy the pizza. Not sure why someone working at a bar would be so critical of someone else's three glasses of wine. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday evening and we were seated within a couple of minutes of walking in.   I ordered the Rosemary Chicken pizza but had them swap the rosemary with basil, and onions for tomato.  My friend ordered the Chicken Fajita pizza, which was the special tonight. Both pizzas were very delicious. See pictures.  I would recommend this location for a casual pizza place."}
{"text":"Where do you go when you have a couple people you're trying to feed with varying levels of adventure-seeking when it comes to food? Brixx Pizza. It offers thin crust pizzas from the ordinary (margherita) to the unusual (spicy shrimp) to rich pastas to sandwiches and wraps.  You can get the crusts in either regular or gluten free (meh) but they also offer a vegan cheese which is pretty darn good!  I always got the Brixx spinach salad with salmon as my go-to dish that didn't make me feel guilty like a pizza, but alas, the average quality of salmon I've had hasn't been great the last year or two (across locations) and they've overcooked it.  So now my favorite salad is the arugula pear with spiced pecans- YUM!  They offer a large beer menu and you can get an \"MBA\" - Master in Beer Appreciation which is like a passport of all the beers they offer.  The service tends to be generally attentive but not particularly happy- in sharp contrast to the staff of 10-15 years ago (I've been coming here a LONG time). The renovated restaurant is definitely more comfortable but I wouldn't say it's a place I would want to hang for a long time unless I'm outside.    Is it the best pizza in Charlotte? No. Is it a safe choice for just about anyone? Yes."}
{"text":"They were out of gluten free dough. Ordered gluten free chicken salad and put croutons all mixed in it with bread. Regular pizza was gross. Soggy crust and grease swimming on top. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Cajun Chicken Penne, so delicious. Sit at the bar with Wade and truly enjoy a moderate priced but quality meal."}
{"text":"Decent food with a very friendly staff.  Great beer specials.  All the pizza's are edible and some are actually pretty good.  Nice beer selection, and monday is the night to go for that.  Not really a whole lot more to say."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went there the other night and had a rather poor experience. We walk in and were seated by a young man. Roughly 10 minutes had gone by and we still hadn't even seen our server to give him our drink orders. Since we were on the patio, we thought maybe he didn't know we were there. When he finally does come, it's the same guy that sat us (so he obviously knew we were there). He's fairly quick with bringing out the water and pizzas we ordered, but then he disappeared again for about 15-20 minutes. We finally had to get one of the bussers to grab our server because we were done eating and wanted our check (we'd finished 10 minutes prior to asking for him). All in all, the food was good, but the service was awful.  EDIT: I have contacted Brixx, as requested, and they have not responded back. It's nice of them to \"make an effort\" to reach out, but doesn't help if they don't actually follow through.  EDIT 2: After my initial edit, the manager contacted me again and sent us some vouchers to give them another shot. We haven't gotten by there yet, but we may give them another shot to see if our experience was a fluke or not."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because we sat in our seats for 15 minutes with zero service.  Good location but they obviously can't handle a crowd."}
{"text":"Spinach pizza was great I love the fact that it doesn't have that really doughy crust and it is piping hot when you get it and also excellent customer service very polite and they were quick making our food to go"}
{"text":"I love the pizza and the beer selection. This location is near the arena and is open late night. This came in handy since the concert we went to let out a little after 11pm. We were starving! Our waitress Shannon greeted us promptly and got our drinks & food out quick! I was happily surprised because it was busy & crowded. Kudos to Shannon and BRIXX!"}
{"text":"REALLY cheap pints on Monday nights.  As do all Brixx.  The food is the same, the tap list is different but very \"national\".  They ran out of the local bird song higher ground after 2-3 beers.  They did have a small pour imperial IPA though.  Mostly female wait staff, but they all looked like teenagers(I don't go just to hit on the waitresses, but these girls look to young to be serving booze).  Just a different vibe in general as per other Brixx IMO.  Brixx is great.  Quick, made to order thin crust pizzas.  MMMMMM pear and gorganzola!  But yet, this venue just doesn't have the same vibe.  Seems more like a kids restaurant than the downtown, Fairview, or Ballentyne location.  I'm always down for buy one get one pizza and apps after 10pm but I have a feeling that the new Duckworths will take a lot of the beer drinkers away from this place and the taco mac across the street.  Birkdale will always pull a crowd, just not me on a night besides $2 pint Mondays."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service could have been a lot better.  Server class 101 - Don't let the drinks go empty and then stay empty the entire meal.  I'm sure it was just that particular server so we will be back, but will steer clear of the girl we had during our first visit."}
{"text":"It's slipped. I was a huge Brixx fan back in the day but it's just not up to par now. Bruschetta was stale over-toasted bread with marinated tomatoes. Salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing. Interior deserves a renovation. I hope they make it, but just think customers expect more, especially now."}
{"text":"A chain restaurant, over priced for small pizza and just not that good. Enzo's or Portafino have better pizza. People probably go to Brixx because they serve beer. Dough is poor."}
{"text":"It's a rare place that offers great food, an awesome beer selection, AND is still welcoming for the little bambinos.  So my husband and I are big fans of Brixx at Blakeney. In addition to roomy booths and tables inside, there is great outdoor seating overlooking the fun park and fountains at Blakeney. The bar is fully stocked with a great beer selection that features local beers in the Carolinas. It's always fun to test a beer from Fort Mill or Asheville! Let's hear it for local support!  The menu is solid with great pizza, yummy sandwiches, and delicious salads. Personal favorites are the spicy shrimp pizza (with basil and cholula hot sauce) and Brixx salad, which has goat cheese and pine nuts--seriously my mouth is watering as i type. Also nice is any pizza can be made on gluten-free or wheat crust, and there are vegan cheese options for those who need it.  I also always appreciate the good service. Last trip we had a server named Colby who was dead on with her recommendations. She told us what pizzas were best with which sauces, and was great about us splitting a salad. She even pointed out we could order one pizza with two different halves without any additional fees.    Brixx is accommodating, delicious and fun!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends before going to the Checkers game, a group of 6 people. We were sat in a booth that was a little cramped, but the place was busy so we didn't mind.   Being an after work event, our group got there in 3 waves. From the time we sat down until the last person got there was probably 10 minutes. The waitress was so impatient. As soon as the last person sat down she came over and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat. Well... yes some of us that had been there knew, but the one who just sat down (my husband) had not even had the chance to look at the menu.   From there it only went downhill. I got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice. She didn't come back to the table after that for 20 minutes. I got the Fresh House Made Mozzarella Sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich. It sounded so good, but the ingredients were wimpy. There wasn't enough tomato (which were not ripe) to cover the bread, and there were maybe 2 shreds of onion. There was nothing fresh about it.   I also ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (not on the menu) which I had to ask if there were any ciders. The waitress did not say the price but beware they are $5.75. Too expensive in my mind for that drink (but what could I do at that point?).   The location is convenient, but I would much rather go to Queen City Q."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch and everything was better than expected. I really thought that there was a good chance I was going to get some bland microwaved overpriced food and what I got was not that. I haven't tried the pizza yet but I did get the spinach/artichoke dip and spaghetti and meatballs. The food was seasoned pretty well and the portion was pretty big. The staff was running around because there were loads of people in for lunch but our server still found time to attend to us. Brixxx is open late and I'll be stopping by after after a Hornets game in the future. I recommend giving Brixx a chance."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I was not expecting much, seeing as how it is a franchise, but I was very impressed. The service was excellent. The price was right. I got the lunch special, 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad, which is available Monday-Friday between 11am-3pm for $7.95. Great value. I had the mediterranean salad and rustica pizza. Both were outstanding! Definitely recommend.   Some reviewers seem to be complaining that there wasn't any sauce on the pizza.. Read the menu before you order. If there is a hollow yellow circle next to the item, the crust is brushed with olive oil. If there is a red filled in circle, the crust has traditional red pizza sauce.   The manager was very visible and friendly. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is where we were seated. The place was virtually empty, but we were seated in a booth right next to the entrance. The restaurant phone kept ringing quite loudly directly behind me. Something to keep in mind for those in charge."}
{"text":"Meh...I don't get it. Brixx just didn't do it for me.   A girlfriend and I stopped in Sunday afternoon. The place wasn't too busy and we were greeted with the good news that they offer $3 mimosas!   The mimosas were good. But that's where the good stops...unfortunately.   Yeah, the prices were reasonable but I just wasn't a fan of the food. And for me I'd rather pay more to get better tasting food.   I ordered the Americo pizza which comes with pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. I didn't like the crust, or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm. Ugh.   No thank you Brixx...I'll stick to other pizza joints to satisfy my pizza needs."}
{"text":"First off, you get a Free app when checking in! I guess I forgot that Brixx's prices were more than reasonable. We were there on a Thursday, which meant $5.00 wines (all wines on the menu, not just a select few), and $3.50 red oaks on tap. We ordered the Korean BBQ meatballs for our free check in app, which were not very good. We like to eat but we couldn't even finish them. They weren't very warm and I would have liked them crispier. I would order something else for your free app!  Brixx is known for their variety of wood fired pizzas. One great thing is that you can substitute wheat for white dough with no up charge. I got the mediterannean salad with chicken. The chicken is actually pulled chicken, and the salad prices are reasonable and good size. We also got the Greek pizza. It was good, and a good size for one or two people. Although, if you are looking to split a pizza, I'd recommend getting one with some sort of protein.   The service was quick, but almost too quick. I would have liked knowing my food took a little longer and was fresher Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I appreciated that we were able to make small substitutions here and there without upcharges.  Overall, not the fanciest choice in Birkdale but great for a chill, laid back atmosphere with a modest beer and wine list, tvs, an outdoor patio and drink specials."}
{"text":"Been here on many happy hours and I love their beer specials and BOGO pizza deals. Absolutely love their spicy shrimp topping pizza and occasionally try the bbq chicken pizza.   Have been with large groups as well and wait staff is very accommodating and friendly. Definitely recommend going here if you feel like grabbing a beer and sharing pizza in a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Brixx Pizza on Fairview for years and have always been pleased however this past weekend we went there and had an unpleasant experience. We had to wait over an hour for a table. When we were seated we were told there was no silverware and we had to go up to the hostess stand for children's menus. We ordered 2 appetizers, hummus and the spinach and artichoke dip (our favorite). Both appetizers were very cold and the dip was 1/2 the portion they usually serve. At this time we still had no silverware. Waitress told us it was a hot commodity. We ordered 3 Brixx salads. The salads were very overdressed there was no goat cheese on the salads and the server did not offer fresh cracked pepper. We also ordered the Rustica pizza and I specifically asked for them to add Goat Cheese. The  pizza had no goat cheese and no prosciutto. The crust was also soggy. Definitely did not taste or look like a brick oven pizza. I sent an email to the management but never received a response. I guess the loss of one customer and her family doesn't mean much to them."}
{"text":"Vegan and want pizza? Go to Brixx! They offer vegan cheese on any menu item as well as whole wheat crust on their pizzas. My pizza also tasted delicious."}
{"text":"NY style pizza (thin crust).  I used to really like the veggie pizza with pepperoni and it was almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  But they recently changed it to a tofu based cheese and now it's pretty nasty.  I wish they'd go back.  The first visit we ordered the hummus and pita appetizer (awesome!).  And a Brixx salad with chicken (awesome!) and a chicken club sandwich (also awesome!).  The sweet tea is very refreshing.  I had diet coke and the waitress never let me go without a free refill.  She was the bomb.  Highly recommended!    It's a local chain but it's not like it's Domino's, Little Caesar's or Pizza Hut.  They definitely try to be fresh and healthy but lately I feel they're losing ground on taste."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had takeout from here once. Each time, the food is just so so. Service has been fine, but the quality of food here is below what it should be. Save your dollars, frozen pizza will come out better than this place. I also had a tiramisu, which was just bad. Don't get it."}
{"text":"Pricey and not good!   There was no flavor to be found.  The service was ok, they were trying hard.  We left still hungry with less money in our pocket! I have had many, many cheap frozen pizza's that had more taste! Very disappointing!    Will not return!"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit to Brixx, I decided to give the Thai Chicken Salad a try. It sounded good, but I had reservations about the limited toppings it was listed to have. When I order a salad, I like a big variety of ingredients, otherwise it's just something I could make at home, so what's the point ... ya know? This salad only had chicken, goat cheese, roasted red peppers & pistachios (random, but delicious nonetheless). Needless to say, when the food came, I wished I had listened to myself. The ingredients had a good flavor, and their was plenty of chicken in it, but it was just such a boring salad. Usually you get carrots, cabbage, onion ... tons of stuff in a thai salad.  This wouldn't be my first choice by any means.  Service was about average, nothing exceptional going on in that department. Their pizza is 100000x better than a salad, so I'd definitely go with the extra calories on this one."}
{"text":"Service is the worst in town. Food inconsistent each visit. Never returning after today's visit"}
{"text":"We swung in here for lunch with the kiddos. We were seated right away and it was super slow. As expected being a newer establishment it was pretty and sparkly! Overall appearance was pretty nice. The bathrooms were really clean and as a parent of a newly potty trained toddler  I was thrilled.   I had the buffalo pizza and I must say... it was pretty good. I wasn't sure I would love it being I am from New York and pizza is one of my favorites. Being that it was brick oven worked out in their favor because I wasn't expecting a regular slice. I thought the flavors were good and the spice wasn't lacking. Everyone liked the food for sure. There were no complaints except that the kids cheese pizza was just ok.   Wait service was ok. Sometimes when the staff is too young and all work together it gets a bit messy.   The bar seemed really nice and there were some pretty decent specials on the wall. We will definitely stop by for a happy hour to check out the crowd on Adult time!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty. Most items are housemade. Pita chips for the  hummus trio are delicious. Consistent  service, moderate prices and clean restrooms. Liked that the manager came by the tables to check on guests. One pizza is 6 small slices, so if greedy, then defintely order two. Did.kot see options to add toppings a la carte. Preset menu. We will back to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Not bad. Waitresses are nice, food is good... But not great. A little pricy for how much you get. Overall a pretty pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated quickly, our beverage order was taken. We ordered a number of items to share. Pimento and chips, Mediterranean salad, mozzarella sandwich, and 4 x 4 pizza. The pimento spread came out with hot toast points and while the color wasn't the usual orange of pimento spread, the taste was great. The Mediterranean salad was served with fresh bread was crisp, fresh and flavorful. The fresh mozzarella sandwich was on fresh baked bread with basil and tomato. It had an awesome flavor and texture. The 4 x 4 pizza was a thin crust with flavorful cheese and sauce.  I would definitely eat here again, an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Brixx never disappoints!! They have a unique and moderately healthy take on pizza that is quite refreshing. If you have any allergy or special diet concerns, this location goes above and beyond to make sure the needs are met. They run a late night discount special, be sure to ask when you call or dine in. Highly recommended for that moment when you have a craving for guilt-free good food."}
{"text":"The pizzas we ordered were wood oven Veggie and Caribbean jerk chicken.. both were awesome and sooo delicious..loved it! Definitely a 2nd time visit!!"}
{"text":"Just as good as I remember Brixx being, and bonus points for having whole wheat crust, gluten free crust, and vegan cheese available as options. To come here you have to deal with the chaos that can be Birkdale, but I was here on a busy Friday for lunch and didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit. Love that they have local beers and some craft beers from great breweries out of state on the menu, and loooove that you can order a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza if you can't decide exactly what you want! Prices are about on point for what you're getting. Atmosphere is casual and comfortable. I like."}
{"text":"As another reviewer said...I really tried. I love the atmosphere so came back 3 times, but each time my experience was worse and I just can't waste any more money here. The first time I gave it a bit of slack because they just opened, but months later my experience was even worse than the first time (sorry Brixx). The food is very average and was different (worse) the third time I visited (perhaps used a cheaper supplier?). Service is SO poor here. I have never consistently had 1 waiter/waitress, always different people coming around and asking if we need anything, but its too much. Last time we put in an order for bruschetta and the bronx bomber pizza, a few minutes later someone else came and asked if we ordered a pizza yet and took our order again. We didn't have silverware and it took about 5 minutes to get the waiters attention. Worst of all...the employees were doing FOOD PREP AT THE BAR. I'm not a restaurant expert, but it didn't look or seem sanitary in any way. I also saw someone at the bar with their friends (probably an employee enjoying dinner) go behind the bar and make their friend a drink - poured about a third of a bottle of Pinnacle into a shaker and mixed it with soda. Clearly taking advantage of their job and the business, and not a trustworthy person. This Brixx should be featured on Mystery Diners."}
{"text":"I went out to eat today with a couple friends and my 3 year old daughter around 1pm. The waitress offered dough for my daughter to play with and she said they would bake it and she could eat it. It sat the entire time and she did nothing with it. She forgot to put my food in so my friends started eating without me for some time. I tried my daughters pizza and it was absolutely terrible. For wood fired pizza I would expect it to be a little crispy, it was doughy. I said I \"might\" get the root beer that's on tap there, it was brought out anyway so I tried it. Super flat, I would expect root beer being on tap to be fizzy at least. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Original review:7/10/2013  My wife and I stopped in for lunch.  Their bruschetta use to be awesome.  The last few times I have been to Brixx..........bland.    This time we tried the hummas................bland.   I had the hawaiian pizza.........bland.  My wife's pizza................bland.  I don't know what has changed but I told my wife ...\"next time I say let's go to Brixx, remind not to\".    Update:10/30/2013 The general manager contacted me about my review.  He wanted to make it up to us so he sent a Comp card.  So the wife and I went back.  We had bruschetta and pizza.  This trip was much better.  The food was delicious and the service was good.  I have to give Brixx management credit cause so often companies do nothing about complaints.  I am changing my rating to 4 from my previous 3.  Good job Brixx!"}
{"text":"We took a big group here last weekend for dinner. They don't take reservations, but we called ahead and told them we were coming. The guy said if there was a wait, it wouldn't be a long one. Famous last words. We waited 40 minutes for a table for 11. They had to pull 3 tables together, and the people at the 3rd table just. wouldn't. leave. I thought the food came out pretty quickly. I got the Brixx Stixx, which are parmesan bread sticks with 2 dipping sauces. I thought my 4.5 year old would like those. He DID like them, but the honey mustard sauce was incredibly spicy and I had to take that one away. I got the Tomato and Basil Pesto pizza, which is basil pesto, mozzarella, roasted garlic cloves, roma tomatoes and goat cheese. It was good but not great. The crust was really chewy and I prefer a thinner, crispier crust. I let my husband try it and he said it was too rich for him. He got the Margherita, and although he said it was OK, I didn't like it. Again, the weird crust, and then I like a more traditional Margherita with tomato sauce. This one comes without it. We thought our son would eat a piece of our pizza, but he didn't like it, so we ordered another order of the Brixx Stixx for him. I would be willing to try some pasta here, but just did not care for the pizza."}
{"text":"Took advantage of a BOGO lunch entree coupon on the app on my phone.  Got the Wood-roasted Chicken Salad, and also the Wood-roasted Chicken Marsala.  Both were excellent and very tasty!  Definitely recommend Brixx!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night at around 10 pm  to meet some friends for drinks.  They had a decent selection of beer, but not the best I've seen in town. However, our server was super friendly and very patient for a table of about 9 people who were having beverages but no food."}
{"text":"Annnnnd that was fast and delicious! Wow the pizzas were Awesome! I had a Margherita Pizza and hubs had a split of Chicken Florentine and supreme and he loves it! The kids devoured their pepperoni pizzas. The service was good. The food was amazing and came out quicker then we thought for a sit down restaurant. We will be back again! Thanks Brixx! Oh and they offer Military discount! Bonus! Yay!"}
{"text":"I had a few friends from out of town: one meat and potatoes type of guy, one vegan, and one with a lactose issue. Where can you eat in Charlotte with so many different types of dietary preferences/allergies? The answer is Brixx Wood Fired Pizza! They have such a great variety of toppings, that there was something for everyone. I had the Greek Pizza with vegan cheese, and it was absolutly amazing. There aren't a lot of places that will cook a good vegan pizza, but they defiantly know what they are doing.   The crust was thin, crispy, and flavorful. The sauce was unique, and the toppings were fresh. The service was great and very helpful. I will for sure be going back again!"}
{"text":"We've always liked Brixx and have had good experiences at their other locations, but today wasn't that great.  Waitress was fine and no issues there, but the food just wasn't that good.  I had a chicken salad and they barely put any dressing on it at all and the chicken was dry and chewy.  My wife's cheese pizza was like wet cardboard.  I think they were rushing out orders and just didn't fire the pizza long enough. We had better pizza at my high school back in Michigan.  The breadsticks were probably the best thing we ate and my sons pasta/Alfredo was pretty decent.  All in all, I've found better things to spend $43 on."}
{"text":"I must say that Tim, manager at Brixx Birkdale, stepped up to the plate and apologized for our lack of good service on our last visit on March 7, 2015, after my Yelp comment. After a little bit of confusion, that all worked out in a positive matter, Tim contacted me and asked that I not give up on Brixx and sent me complimentary gift certificates.   We used the certificates within the last month and it was just as I remembered it to be, awesome.  (August 10th and August 28th) We were greeted and seated immediately.  The food was very fresh and delicious and our waitress, Ashley,  was extremely kind and she genuinely seemed like she loved her job and working to please her customers.   I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Tim, at Brixx Birkdale, for following up with this customer's complaint. All is good again and it feels great to be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"It's very conflicting when you have multiple locations of a restaurant, within the same city...thus my dilemma with this review.  I'm used to the service & quality of the Brixx location on 6th/7th Street, downtown.  While the service here yesterday was really good, the quality was lacking.  My boyfriend & I met a few friends here yesterday & thankfully, Milo (my dog) got to come along (dogs are allowed on the patio). For it to be 3 PM in the afternoon, the place was jumping inside & out.  Our waitress was very sweet & efficient, as we had multiple water & alcohol orders for our beverages, she always kept the glasses full. For our order, we got pizzas (Bronx Bomber to share between my boyfriend & I) & 2 Cesar side salads.  I echo Shauna a little bit, as I was a bit disappointed. The dressing was almost nonexistent & there were mainly pieces of the spine in the salad (which I'm not a fan of).  Our pizza didn't hit the mark either. The oregano was on half of the pizza, instead of spread all over, the edges of the pizza were somewhat burnt, & it just didn't taste as good as the ones at 6th/7th Street. Our friends had a veggie pizza & the spinach artichoke dip & seemed pleased with their food.  Other notes: parking is EXTREMELY limited out front, so you may want to check in the shopping center behind the restaurant.  The restaurant itself - as for the outside - is clean, but you have to deal with a lot of birds flying into the patio area, as well as looking for food on the ground. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"First of all, I love Brixx Pizza. Bronx bomber pizza is heaven to me! And I'm happy with the service here. Generally, I never have to wait long for a table & when I've gotten take out, it's always ready when I get there.  My complaints is it's SO busy just about any time I do go & there's not a lot of seating, therefore I'm crammed up against the loud group of teenagers or screaming kids.   Back to the food - Bronx Bomber is my favorite: thin crust, light sauce, cheese, slices of sausage, proscuitto, & basil leaves. Love it!"}
{"text":"Another spot on my list of consistency... :D  This is in a prime location for me before any event at Time Warner Cable Arena. I go in, order my always delicious Bronx Bomber pizza, eat & am on my way. Maybe the staff is trained in knowing who's in a hurry vs. those that have no where to be.  My pizza always comes out perfect. The thin crust is never burnt, toppings are plentiful & well distributed. The sauce is light, which is extremely important to me.  Yes, it's crowded & thankfully has a mix of people between the downtown workers, sports fans, families, couples, or groups.  Service is quick & friendly."}
{"text":"Okay This was my first visit to this delightful pizza establishment and I was not disappointed. The brusheta was incredible with large amounts of tomatoes and small quarter size disc of cheese on top. The personal pizza was also incredible and the staff took our order and delivered to our table quickly. My friend and I also had a delightful Mediterranean salad with Feta cheese ,calamari olives ,red bell peppers and tomatoes with a Greek dressing. Can't wait to stop by again soon as the Chicken Alfredo is next on my list."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Cheese was unmelted , still in cubes. Sad tomatoes and a few shreds of basil. If they can get the margherita right forget the  rest. Service was not good no o e came back to ask how it was. Crust was not right either. If it's wood fired cheese should be melted fully and blistered. Not recommended unless you have a low bar."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything more I could have asked for from my trip to Brixx. The waitress was polite and got to us quickly. She was not bothered by my request to split the check (for which I have gotten some major eye rolls elsewhere). The food was excellent. There were very few pizzas on the menu I didn't want to order. When I finally settled on the Rustica, which had prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives and roasted garlic, I couldn't have been more pleased. The crust was crunchy but not dry and all the toppings were delicious. My dinner companion got the Chicken Florentine and he was also quite pleased. It is also of note that they have a respectable beer list, including one of my very favorites which is often hard to find on tap, Victory Hopdevil. Perhaps most importantly, when we asked for a box to take home our leftovers, the box was not made of styrofoam! No decomposing, food sticking, non-microwavable to go boxes at Brixx!   All in all, an excellent meal and one I will be sure to repeat."}
{"text":"Terrible!! I just got take out from there and the pizzas barely had cheese and toppings and were super small. Same issues with the salads... It is really unfortunate as they used to put out a quality product. They seemed to have cheaped down everything while keeping the same prices..."}
{"text":"The location was kind of hard to find being that it's on the backside of the plaza it's located in. The ambience is great. We came as a group for my friends birthday gathering. Food wnd drinks were extremely slow to come out. We waited close to 45 mins for food and drinks took close to 20 mins. Our server was new and did the best he could. I will give it another shot because the food was delicious. I just hope to have a better experience the next time."}
{"text":"Great services, very polite waiters, good Food the Tomato Basil Soup is tasty and hearty, highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Brixx Pizza may be good for some tastes, but I think its a little overrated.  When I think pizza joint, I think substantial slices and a homely atmosphere.  Brixx doesn't fit the bill. The Dilworth location is good....nice view, nice atmosphere and attentive service.  However, the the average 10\" pizza was around $9.  They specialize in thin crust pizzas.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  But if you want a heartier pizza, try Fuel.   The beverage selection was limited and though this is a nice place for a lunch date, I wouldn't recommend it for a night out.  To its defense, they have salads that appear to be prepared individually rather than in bulk.  My friend had a huge bruschetta platter (though it was called an appetizer).  I would go back if invited by friends, but what's the point in going somewhere the specialty isn't so special?  Give me a nice medium-crust, no-frills pizza any day.   Hey, you wouldn't go to the Waffle House if you hated their waffles would you?"}
{"text":"I only went because I heard about it in a Migos/Carnage collab. Service was great, pizza was a little dry but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab an individual pizza with friends in uptown Charlotte.  They always run good deals on beers too! Last time I got a pint of a 9% beer on special for $3.  Very fun to go there on Saturdays at 8 pm for team trivia. Service is very good.  Waiter named Brian is great."}
{"text":"Service very nice on a busy night. Almost as if they predicted our requests. Eaten here before and food was best it's been."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and we finally made it over there. We went around 4pm on a Wednesday afternoon so there was plenty of parking. I'm not a fan of any of the cramped and limited parking in this block of town, but that's not a knock against Brixx.  We ordered the Brixx Stixx which were garlic Parmesan long and skinny breadsticks with marinara sauce. They were good but could have used a bit more flavor.   My wife ordered a pepperoni pizza and I got the Americo pizza (pepperoni and mushroom). It was really good and the cheese was very stringy and flavorful!   We decided to try their limited dessert items as well. My wife got the raspberry swirl cheesecake (not currently listed on the menu) which she really enjoyed. I got a root beer float which was fine but served in a regular glass rather than a frosted mug.  Overall we enjoyed the experience a lot and will visit again. The staff was very friendly and service was prompt."}
{"text":"This place is a good restaurant to go to with a bunch of friends since there is plenty of seating. We came here to watch the NBA Finals. The beer was pretty cheap and the pizza was tasty. Got the mushroom pizza but with goat cheese instead of mozzarella and they had no problems with switching it out. I really like the pizza crust here - chewy and not soggy. Ser"}
{"text":"Location is ideal, the outside area is very casual and may be noisy due to the play ground and water fountains near the restaurant. The servers are always so friendly and humorous. The service itself is pretty good. My favorite is the pizza, the dough is thin and you can tell the difference and quality of this dough compared to others. My tip is to get ranch with the pizza it makes it so much better. (Even though it's already good). If you are looking for an appetizer the Bruschetta is delicious and the balsamic vinaigrette that comes on top of it is it sweet and compliments the bread."}
{"text":"Many reasons why this has 1 star. Pick up the pizza and it's already cold. Thinking there was enough for 2 or 3 people when I ask for a large, the lack of info of telling me that all pizzas are 10 inches would have been nice to know when you get a piece of pizza that is not geometrically big enough to cut it into 8 pieces, much less it tasted like shit and the \"wood\" fired grill must not have been working, so I guess they used a microwave with a heating lamp. This may be my 2nd review ever, but this place is a damn joke. Gives pizza a bad name. Figure it out business owner"}
{"text":"Brixx is pretty awesome!  They have a new pizza, Thai Chili (or something like that)- it is my new obsession.    The staff is pretty friendly, they have a good beer selection, and they have a beer club where you earn prizes.  You can sit inside or out on their patio, which is nice when the shopping center is doing live music."}
{"text":"We always order the same sandwiches from here. Absolutely amazing. Well, this past weekend we encountered a minor problem with one of the employees. She overcharged us for 2 sandwiches and stated that \"included salads\" were an extra charge. Total for 2 sandwiches usually comes out to $20-21 since the sandwich we order is 8.95 plus tax. We disputed this charge but this young lady just kept getting angry saying that salads were extra and not included. As you can see, the menu clearly states that sandwiches are served with salad, fresh fruit or chips.   This young lady (bless her heart) could not calculate what 9+9 was when I had asked her. Obviously I'm going to question her math skills if she can't calculate basic math and read the menu. The total kept coming out to $27 and change even when I had asked her to ring up the order a second time hoping it would be a different outcome. There was no need to call the manager. I just had to walk her through a basic elementary math lesson and a menu reading quiz. I think when she finally came to her senses and the calculation finally registered, she was rude and didn't even apologize. Her demeanor and body language was just hateful. She knew she was wrong.  This is a decent establishment but please when y'all hire people, make sure they know their basic math and is able to read and be aware of what is on the menu."}
{"text":"Great Pizza  Great Service!! Awesome beer selection and can't beat $5 Glasses is wine on Thursdays! It was a perfect night to sit on the patio and relax after a long day! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good service and good pizza. Bronx Bomber was delicious and 2.50 craft beer night ! Good selection of beers. Pizza choices were diverse. Good crowd for trivia on Monday night"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group before an Illini basketball game and it was a great decision! They accommodated our large party and the waitress was extremely organized with all of our separate orders. The food was really great. I love that you can get half and half pizzas! They have so many choices it really helped to be able to try two. Even with our large group the bills were taken care of very quickly so we had plenty of time to make it to the game. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a gathering place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a late lunch with my husband and was excited to try the pizza. We were seated by a friendly hostess and the server came by within a few minutes. We both ordered water and a pizza. I got the artichoke hearts veggie option and my husband got the Caribbean jerk pizza. We then sat there unattended until a different server brought out our pizzas. I asked him to bring our drinks and he apologized and got them. The pizzas looked good visually when delivered but there was a lot of crust as I ate and my toppings were not evenly spread. Two of the pieces literally had no artichoke on them. My husband said his was not much better. The sauce on the Caribbean jerk pizza was not evenly spread so not every bite was flavorful. The crust was not good by itself so we both had a pile of crust at the end. We did not see our server again, but the waiter that delivered our food and drinks stopped to see if we needed anything else. I asked for the check and he asked who our server was. I told him I did not know. The server then reappeared and the checks aid his name was Sam G. We paid and left. Truly disappointed in the food and service."}
{"text":"I'd heard a few recommendations to try the pizza here. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that they offer some options you don't find at every pizza place. With that said, I didn't really like the pizza."}
{"text":"love this Brixx! My brother and I actually drove 40 minutes into Charlotte to eat here for dinner. Got a friendly greeting as soon as we entered and were seated immediately; outside seating is serene, clean, and quiet. The food is delicious, nothing quite like it! The crust is thin and tasteful. Well priced (about $10 for a 10\" pizza). If you can, ask for Shay (not sure if I spelled it correctly or not) but she is seriously the best! Very nice and gives great service."}
{"text":"Bartender with dreads has the personality of a brick wall.... was ordering some pizza and was going to get a beer while waiting and he didn't ask if I wanted anything else just cashed me out..... probably won't visit again"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE PIZZA! My bf tried to tell me it was a bad place to go for pizza but I wouldn't listen I thought he was lying wasted my money on the pizza I purchased super cold super gross nothing special not what pizza supposed to taste like!  I cried that's how bad the pizza was and I eat anything. Well that's what I thought until I tried this place. Don't waste your money here go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was pretty great! Service was also the bomb. Cleanliness could use some help though. The table behind us was dirty for the entire time we were there. Floor had a bit of trash as well.  Onto the food!   I got the Wood Roasted Chicken Sandwich! I really enjoyed this simple savory dish. It's a safe option and I have to say it was delicious. I gobbled the whole thing up! My waitress was kind enough to give me a little bit of pasta salad which I greatly enjoyed as well as chips (which were slightly stale tbh). I couldn't decide and she kindly offered both so 5 stars for service for that!   We also got the Korean Meatballs as an appetizer. Definitely a savory dish that's a bit much on it's own but the flavor is still really delicious! Think of a tangy bbq flavor. I certainly recommend it on the condition that you get something carby to dip it in.  My weirdo tip? Dip the chips in the meatball sauce. Dip the extra bread from the sandwich in the sauce and eat it with the meatball! Heck, dip the pasta salad penne in the sauce. It's dang good!"}
{"text":"Great location and beer specials. Food, as a whole, is just okay. It'll do in a pinch, but I definitely don't seek it out on purpose. Service and employees are typically great, although one employee acted a little \"off\" recently and that's putting it politely. Eventually I was just entertained by it. Will definitely be back for beer specials!"}
{"text":"I attended a fundraiser for relay for life where a portion of an entrée purchase was donated to the cause.....great concept and idea and shout out to Brixx for being a part of an awesome event.  This was my first time at this location and I haven't had their pizza in years.   Parking is available in 7th street station and they will validate.  I would say that the service here was lacking, which shouldn't happen at such an event or any other time.  I waited quite a bit for a server to come over and take my order, we received no silverware or napkins, just basic things that were a bad look.  I ended up ordering a kid's pizza for my son and I ordered the Rustica pizza(prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke, olives, and roasted garlic) which was excellent and I would order that again if I decide to go back.  As a plus, there is a free app with check in and the purchase of 2 entrees, plus cash back on your purchase."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and I took my family there for a Saturday night dinner.  We arrived after the main dinner crowd was leaving.  I had eaten at a Brixx for lunch in Gastonia about a month earlier and had a good experience.  The Foxcroft space was nice, but it was a little on the dirty and worn looking side.  The side Caesar salad for $3.25 was terrible and it came the same time as the pizza.  I think a gas station cooler could have served up a better salad.  We ordered 3 pizzas. The BBQ, Veggie, and Meatball.  The BBQ was slightly tasty but the others were bland and flavorless.  The service was equally as bad.  Long stretches where you could not even flag someone to help you.  Another waiter helped for a while during the middle of the meal and we thought our female server (J) had gone home, but she finally reappeared at check time.  We had to wait for drink refills and the check an excessive amount of time.  So close to home we can walk, but we will opt to get in the car and drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Brixx Pizza but won't be my last.  Service was excellent, I believe we had Brandon as our server. I opted for the pesto chicken salad sandwich with pasta as my side which was delicious. The Penne pasta was well seasoned with a lite creamy like dressing with olives, feta cheese(?) and I think there were also purple onions.  The chicken salad was fresh, the chicken was moist and equally well seasoned. I asked for an extra side of pesto to kick the flavors up just another notch.  My husband opted for the 4X4 pizza which he said was also good, all of their pizzas are 10 inch.    I also tried a Strawberry Mojito ( I normally stick to vodka cocktails) and was pleasantly surprised and pleased with my selection.  It was a bit on the sweet side but they did not skimp on the fresh mint or fresh strawberries, I would definitely order another one the next time I visit.    The atmospheric is very casual, laid back, and family friendly. Added bonus of Tvs to watch while dining.  There was also a patio area to dine in if you choose.  Overall, extremely happy with my first visit and look forward to returning again and exploring more of their menu options."}
{"text":"Great lil spot! Wonderful staff & comfortable atmosphere.   The Asian Pear & candied pecan salad is Devine! Crisp & fresh, just the right amount of dressing and absolutely delicious!   The Greek pizza is light, but filling, no grease, handmade flatbread to die for. Feta cheese is a favorite of mine so it only adds to the tasty pizza.   Reasonable wine prices.  My girlfriend had the Mediterranean salad with grilled salmon to which she said had been cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Good pizza. They do a great job on their crust made in house daily. Recently they introduced a new gluten free crust that is light and airy with a good taste. I'd recommend doing a half and half pizza, that way you get to try 2 kinds. The best part is there is no upcharge. They have BOGO on pizzas in local magazines so that's the way to go. Excellent patio to sit our on at night!"}
{"text":"My wife is new to gluten free and a low fodmap diet.  When we walked into Brixx,  the friendly server, Marieta,  was very helpful choosing menu items that matched my wife's dietary needs.  Brixx had a gluten free menu that also had info on garlic, onion and lactose allergens and which foods should be selected for an optimal dining experience.  Marieta was great and made a potential stressful experience a fantastic one."}
{"text":"Excelente s pizza s, la atención al cliente, inmejorable, altamente recomendado en Charlotte NC."}
{"text":"This pace is great!!! I love going for pizza and drinks after work. It definitely is the best pizza around. I recommend the Mexican pizza, it is my ultimate favorite."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But as far as chains go, it's a friendly place, and the pizza is decent. I always get the wild mushroom/arugula...I should really branch out, try different things, but I can't seem to help myself. A good weeknight option when I don't feel like cooking. We find the blackboards and chalk amusing...good place for people of all ages---family-friendly, but still fine for childfree grownups."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 Value: 4/5 Experience: 3/5 Service: 5/5  Average: 3.9/5   Located in uptown Charlotte, this popular restaurant offers a wide range of tastes and flavors. The price range is moderate, with most items around 10 dollars. This is great if you are looking to get pizza, but not great if you plan on eating a sandwich. Service was great he entire time. They managed to keep a 30 person party happy and refilled over the course of an hour. The food was good. Brixx is known for their wood/fired pizza, and it is clear why. Their crust was cooked to perfection and the sauce and toppings were wonderfully complementary. The sandwiches were not as great. I found the chicken to be very dry and tough on the chicken club. The atmosphere is that of a restaurant-bar. There are some questionable restaurant features, but all in all it is a nicely decorated restaurant. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for pizza for dinner or a heavy lunch."}
{"text":"Poor service. Waitress was not very keen on checking on us. Other waitstaff were too engrossed in a lunch party to notice our dinner was not being enjoyed. I got a Mediterranean salad and has their \"famous roasted chicken on top. The salad was mostly canned ingredients and the chicken tasted like turkey. If you know anything about chicken, if it tastes like turkey its old not fresh as advertised. The only saving grace in the meal was the incredible hummus trio app. There was a black bean hummus with cumin. It was amazing !"}
{"text":"Good & cheap casual food. House made mozzarella, good salads, great specials. Nothing fancy here, but never disappoints because the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Thanks Janet for the great customer service. True asset to the company and thanks for keeping our wine glasses full!"}
{"text":"Delicious wood fired pizza in North Carolina. This place has a great outdoor seating area where I enjoyed refreshing Arnold Palmers while waiting for homemade pizza. The pizza was clearly Made in a brick oven and was very satisfying. I am a NYer and can be a pizza snob, and this pizza definitely exceeded my expectations. There were a variety of options that didn't disappoint. Consider it gourmet pizza...not your typical NY slice."}
{"text":"Parking at this new restaurant is a let-down....especially at lunch and dinner hours.   This is a shared parking lot with Moe's.... it's kind of like that parking lot up at the Starbucks on Prospect.... small and narrow.... so you have two fairly middle-of-the-road chain restaurants sharing a one lane parking row.   I'm already off to a bad experience here.   As you walk in, it is actually very nice.... lots of seating and a clear view of the wood-burning oven.  The menu is fairly large --- lots of choices for all types of palettes -- salads, appetizers, pastas and pizzas.   The waitresses are friendly and they were hamming it up with my five-year old son, who was supplied with crayons and a little booklet.   He loves pineapple on his pizza so he put in the order for a Hawaiian pizza and I ordered a greek-like salad.     The waitress brought water and my first sip, there was a little piece of clear plastic floating in it... yuck.  Don't know what that was about but it seemed harmless.  The food came about 10 minutes later and the salad was huge.... with a huge chunk of bread.   I ate about half of it and took the rest home.   The pizza came out --- it was about 10 inches, cut into six slices.   The crust was thin and foldable....which I like, but it was fairly tasteless.... there wasn't any tomato sauce on it, and am not sure if the description said it was a sauce-less pie or not... but my son didn't seem to mind it.... he was just happy about having pineapple and ham (or prosciutto to be more specific) on his pizza!   My real gripe about this pizza was the amount of cheese.... it was so much.   It was gooey and melty which was a good thing, but there was this layer of grease sitting on top of the pie which was off-putting and made it very salty....We easily finished it because we were pretty hungry and frankly, it isn't that much better than Papa John's or Jet's.... just lighter (in terms of crust and texture) but just the same amount of greasiness.   I would choose this place over Monical's...but it still ranks in the low-mid range of pizza places in town.    My top 5 list is still:  Dragon Fire, Antica Pizza, Pizza M, Jet's and Papa Del's.   I still haven't tried Azzip so that's why it's not on the list..... the bottom 3 of my list are in no particular order, it just depends on what style of pizza I want."}
{"text":"A client took me here today for a quick lunch.  He told me you have to try the wraps so I ordered a pizza lol.  I figure thats what they have plastered all over so it should be good.   The pizza was just oaky.  I think I can make a better pizza at home with buying some dough.  Homemade pizza is what it reminded me of.  If you want decent pizza try NY pizza on south  The wraps did look good though.  I should have listened, but im stubborn."}
{"text":"ok, i wanted badly to give a higher rating...The building is awesome, lots of TV's, beer choices, ETC.  Lots of food choices..  The negatives, VERY expensive, the pasta i had (penne with blackened chicken) was extremely salty.  My wife got a half/half pizza and while it was \"good\", it was NOT worth 12+ dollars.  Azzip pizza is basically identical for 1/2 the price.  I will go back, but they have work to do."}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews that said that this place was average but everything tastes great and the service was definitely there!"}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and meet the staff. The staff here is friendly, interesting, and eclectic. During the years I've been eating at this Brixx location, the staff I've known include an actor (now living in LA), an artist, a photographer, future lawyer, several musicians, and found one of my best employees. The food is pretty good too.  So drop in and tell Jack I sent you."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a place to eat my last meal in Charlotte and this restaurant came up on my phone. So i figured give it a try, I went in there and was great by the host. I checked out the menu and they had a list of different pizzas. I wanted to try two different ones and they said they can put half and half on a whole pizza. So i was like COOL!   The pizza came out but it was on a plate, which was pretty small. If your going to eat a dinner there or a main course that was pretty small like an appetizer.   I ate there Italian one and there chicken garlic one on the other half.   Portions were pretty small and I wish i had a bigger portion for a main course."}
{"text":"On Sunday, 10/4 around 5:30,  I met up with another Mom and our 3 kids for a post-kid-bday-party dinner. The server, Evan was so kind and patient and engaged the kids in a sweet, playful way.  The arugula salad and shrimp was absolutely delicious and the wine was 1/2 off! My son devoured his pizza (that Evan kindly let cool off so the little ones could dive in). Then, my son started running around as the others chased him. I had to rope him in, for safety, and carried him back to the booth. An overstimulated 3 year old had a meltdown and began to scream. The kind of scream so shrill, and loud, you're left wondering why the glass didn't shatter.  At the tantrum point, we were waiting for the check. It wasn't taking long but in screaming toddler minutes, it felt like forever. A man came over and asked me to tell the child to stop screaming. First, if you've ever had a toddler melting down, they're not listening nor are they ready to comply with your requests. My fight or flight kicked in and I went off on the guy (not one of my better moments). I recall saying I'd send him a psych report in the mail and at the end \"Thanks so much for your patience and understanding!\" I later learned this man was a MANAGER.   If I may suggest, for the future, when a mom is embarrassed, hiding her face and laughing due to awkwardness from a scene that is making EVERYONE miserable, you may want to approach her with more empathy. Ie. \"I can see you have your hands full! If it will help any, I can have the server to expedite the check or if you need to, you can settle up the bill tomorrow?\"  I would have appreciated a life line... Evan came back with the bill and apologized (he will make a great Dad if he isn't already). You know... my son can charm his way into a free ice cream and another time, he's a 3 year old having a tantrum. Thanks to all the folks who lend a helping hand instead of passing judgment and presuming that would never happen to them."}
{"text":"DIDNT HAVE A BITE OF FOOD.. BELLS 2 HEARTED ALE ON DRAFT? in charlotte? best decision all day, brilliant IPA..Need I say more"}
{"text":"What is not to love?!? Great pizzas, great salads, great drink specials, large booths and quick service! Oh and the best Blue Cheese dressing around town. Love their Two for Tuesday BOGO coupon!! Keep it up Brixx! ;)"}
{"text":"Brixx is a solid 3 stars in my book.  I have been a few times and while the food is consistently A-OK, the service is very hit or miss.    Located off of Fairview, at the back of the shopping center (the first time that I met friends there, I could not find the place), parking is ample at off peak times - during the dinner rush, you may have to parallel park in the lot, or park on the street next to the restaurant.    My most recent visit was for dinner with a couple of friends.  I arrived at the tail-end of the dinner rush (no where to park, annoyed) and my dinner companions had already been seated and ordered beers.  The waiter we had was bleh.  For every refill, I had to flag him down.  They would have sold more beer to the folks that I was eating with if he had been more attentive.  The pizzas are good, better than the delivery chains.  Thinner crust, wood fired pizza.  My typical order is the chicken florentine for $11 (chicken, bacon, roma tomatoes, spinach, feta and mozzarella) and the veggies typically taste fresh with a moderate sprinkling of chicken and bacon.  Their pizzas come in one size - too much for 1, not enough for 2 unless you supplement with a salad or are a light eater.  But, as I always say - any pizza can be a personal pizza if you work hard and believe in yourself.  I like Brixx.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The service was ok I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and added pepperoni. When the pizza came out it had maybe two pepperonis on it. I mentioned my complaint to the waitress. She said she would go get a manager to come and speak with me. The manager never came out to the table. I was not wanting anything for free but if I am going to pay for pepperoni on a pizza I expect more than two pieces. The atmosphere was great. But I do not see myself going back."}
{"text":"I visited Brixx with a few friends and two toddlers. The staff was very patient with the little ones.  In total, our table ordered 6 pizzas. It wasn't a particularly busy Sunday for New year's weekend but the pizzas still didn't come out together. I certainly appreciate the children's pizza coming first. It allowed time to cool before the adults received their orders but the timeline was still more scattered than it should have been.  I ordered the margarita pizza which is a personal favorite from wood fired pizza joints. Brixx didn't disappoint there. Sometimes, the large slices of mozzarella aren't completely melted and other times they are so large you feel you may choke trying to chew it up. Brixx did a great job of portioning the cheese and melting without burning the crust. The basil leaves maybe should have been chopped but I've never known someone to choke on basil, so I'll take it.  My boyfriend had a mushroom pizza of some kind. He seemed to quite enjoy it and took the leftovers home. Not always the case for him. Our other friends had meats pizzas or pepperoni's. All looked delicious and what wasn't finished, also went home with them.  Overall, service and food quality was pretty good. My main concern was the timing of the pizzas but I think the toddlers were a bit distracting during the ordering process and may have flustered the staff. The only other suggestion would be to get a different disinfectant or change the rag more regularly. The table was cleared prior to us being seated but seemed to have a cleaning residue. Otherwise, I'll definitely go back and try again."}
{"text":"Typical California style pizzas, far from NYC. Their brushetta and jerk shrimp caribbean pizza is surprisingly good, nothing to rave about. Service was pleasant. We were immediately seated when we went since we just got there right before the dinner rush. There seemed to be a long wait after we left so I can see why other reviewers bashed this place for the wait time. Timing is everything."}
{"text":"After having lived in the EU for 7 years returning to the US and having pizza just wasn't the same!!   I like their 'no sauce' pizzas! Especially as my 5 yr old doesn't do well with tomato sauce. In fact as I was on my way home tonight I received a request for pizza for dinner, so I called and had the best surprise when I found out that I could order kid sized pizzas with any choice of toppings. One artichoke, Americo and kids cheese later there were 3 extremely happy people at my house!!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars for having BUY 1 GET 1  on pizza after 10pm. That's perfect for my boyfriend and I since we work til 9pm and sometimes later.  This is the only food item they serve after 10pm but we know this going in and are ok with that.  It's usually very slow on week nights when we are there.  We have only been here twice so far and it's on our way home and drive past everyday.  Pizza is good and perfect size for me. I have enough to take to work the next day. Also free parking is major bonus!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for the 1st time in a very long time. They really have there act together now. Food was absolutely delicious and the service was amazing!! Even the manager came over and made sure how our experience was."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times with and without grandchildren.  Located in the large shopping center at the junction of Rea Road and Audrey Kell Road.  A franchise very popular in Charlotte it is consistently good.  They keep it clean and the staffs are pretty much always on point.  Although located in a busy shopping center, this location has a pleasant fenced off dining area outside.  Not too noisy and most importantly, if you have children with you they cannot get out if they wander.  Sometimes they do slip away, so with cars continually roaming the shopping center it is reassuring that they will be safe, even if your attention slips.  I especially like the menu choices.  There are lots of them and they are creative and interesting.  I like the shrimp with hot sauce and the wild mushroom with arugula.  And the crusts are thin and charred a bit by their super hot pizza oven.  One 10\" pizza is more than enough for a meal.    Good bar with an excellent selection of beers.  Many on tap.  Prices are reasonable for drinks and pizza.  There are some other menu items, but we usually stick to the pies."}
{"text":"I like this place. I come here to get pizza with my family and have some beer out of their local brewery selection. Don't get me wrong, this is the American version of pizza, something that would immediately cause a riot in Italy and cost your life in Napoli, but still I can brave it and be happy. We come here often as the waiters are nice, they have a place to eat outside and their desserts are good too."}
{"text":"Why wont I be a fan when I get a free pizza for buying one.  Yes its BOGO pizza and apps after 11PM (on Friday and Saturday) and after 10PM on other days I believe.  This one Friday I reached the place by 1050 and was waiting until my watch stuck 11PM.  Cheap!! I know right. The taste is great, its your thin crust pizza and we have tried most of their veggie pizzas and its all great.  Situated in the new Kingsley compound which by itself looks upscale and the inside of the restaurant is just great.  Beautiful décor and nice outdoor seating.  Not so much crowd though.   Always went there after 11PM and go straight to the bartender to place the order and impatiently wait for it.  This guy bartender, not so friendly, no small talks, no smile nothing.  Its just a take out and bogo, so probably he thinks he is already offering more?  whatever I don't care.  LOL.  The other night there was this sweet lady at the bar and she was lively, making conversation, greeting etc., basically treating us like customers. Artichoke pizza is great, Margarita is good, all veggie pizza is great and have tried their brix sticks and Spinach artichoke dip, both were good.  Its open late so always a great place for a late night munching."}
{"text":"5 Stars now after the last few visits.  I went in Monday and asked what the beer special was.  They said \"$2 domestics\" which nomally means Bud, Bud Light, etc but not  here - almost every beer made in the USA (except for a couple of high gravity ones) were $2.  This includes OMB, Skull Coast, Four Friends, Highland Gaelic, etc.  Tuesday all Charlotte beers are $2.50, and Sunday all NC beers are $2.50 (plus wine is 1/2 price bottles).  The service has been very good too.  So 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for the beer and service."}
{"text":"I am no stranger to Brixx Pizza. I used to frequent the uptown location often before events at the arena.It is nice to have a Brixx in Fort Mill, but it may not be everyone's favorite pizza style. The pizzas are mostly personal-sized and range from about $10-12 each. It is not the place you would go to get an 18 inch pizza and some wings to take home. However, it is nice to go for a sit-down meal and the food is almost all made fresh. They also have sandwiches made on fresh bread, pastas, salads, a few appetizers, and a decent selection of wine and craft beers. My favorite pizza is the one with pear and Gorgonzola. That is not my normal style of pizza, but the flavors work well together.  The service was good when we went but the place does get a little crowded. They often have BOGO specials so sign up for their emails and follow them on social media. They also offer different drink specials each day.  If you are in the area and want a decent, fresh-made sit-down meal, then Brixx is a decent choice."}
{"text":"Customer service was a zero, Devin was not attentive at all, good thing her manager was. We had to get her attention for a refill, it seemed to have bothered her because she slid it on to our table. She also brought the bill without offering dessert.  Ok that alone isn't enough to stop me from returning, people have bad days. Now the food...  I had the tomato basil salmon with penne pasta. The salmon was good, the pasta was subpar. The Korean meatballs were dry and the pizza greasy. And that is why I will not be returning. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"The pizzas, pastas, bruschetta and spinach artichoke dip are fantastic. Good atmosphere and nice staff. Never had a super long wait to sit down."}
{"text":"I have been here before had good service, good food however this time my family and I came to eat lunch and we sat for 8 minutes without anyone coming to greet us, I could have let that slide but a server and hostess walked by our table a couple of different times and never acknowledged us. Our family walked out and went across the street to another restaurant."}
{"text":"The \"pizza\"here is a joke. The slices are barely the size of your hand , so best order two for any real fill. Bartenders are nice."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 1 star because the service was ok and the food was average. But after having dinner and conversation. I saw this crawling across the booth rail. Yes, I hope it was a palmetto bug but it is in the roach family please exterminate your building."}
{"text":"Great pizza and bread sticks. Fast service and good atmosphere. Reasonable price chicken pesto pizza is to die for !! Best pizza!!  Great service!!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY had a chance to try Brixx pizza! My husband and I came here before a Hornets game to get a bite to eat. We decided to order two pizzas. There pizzas are meant to be personalized sized, but they are pretty big! Well worth the $10. The pizza is made from a brick oven so it came out super fast. The crust was light and crispy- cooked perfectly.   We both ordered pizza and we were able to split pizzas half n half so we eventually were able to try 4 different flavors! Btw they have about 20 Pizza options for you to pick from. Here were our choices:   Pear and Gorgonzola: very unique. I liked this pizza, but would never order a full pizza of it. The nuts on the pizza kinda threw me off however, If you like something different I would recommend this.   Rosemary chicken: very refreshing with the Rosemary. The pizza also included mushrooms and onions.   Meatball: oh my! The meatballs were awesome!   Jerk chicken: this was my favorite flavor. It was spicy, but the pineapple on the pizza counteracted it. I would order this pizza again!    Overall we had a good experience at Brixx and I would go there again. I love the variety of pizzas they have, plus they offer salads and sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've lived in Charlotte nearly 18 years and had never visited this place.  Some mysteries are just too mind boggling, I guess.    This review is based on only one visit, but I was impressed enough with my salad to log on and write about it.  My salad had grilled chicken on a bed of spinach and mixed greens with some nice croutons, goat cheese and pistachios.  Yes, pistachios!  What a cute little surprise!  My waitress was friendly and took the time during the lunch rush to help me decide what I may enjoy.  I enjoyed a simple, yet healthy meal and will absolutely go back the first chance I get!"}
{"text":"I was craving some pizza lately, and when a friend mentioned this place for dinner I pretty much immediately agreed. The place is kind of hard to spot, it's tucked away in the middle of the square in the shopping center. But once you get there it's an awesome place to hang out at! We were seated promptly when we entered even though it seemed to be a busy night for them.  My date wasn't especially hungry so he asked to order the spinach artichoke dip appetizer and a bowl of baked potato soup as his entree. This thing was humongous, If all the appetizers are this big I have no idea how many people end up having to take their entrees home, or maybe they're meant to be shared for bigger groups. I opted for their special that night which was a pesto, roasted shallot, sun dried tomato with mozzarella and basil pizza. It was a good sized portion for a personal pizza, however I was kind of disappointed when I found out that even though the pizza was a thin crust it wasn't very crispy.  Our server was very friendly and on top of water refills which I always appreciate. She was also happy to give my date an extra order of spinach artichoke dip and crustini to take home when she noticed that he had finished all of it, talk about A+ service!  Next time I will probably try the various pastas they have, since that seems to get more attention than the pizzas in the reviews I've seen so far, since my meal wasn't super memorable but their service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Brixx is just okay for me, I prefer my pizza deep dish and fatty like it should be. But when I want to eat an entire pizza by myself thin crust is the way to go. I like how this location's thin crust pizza is quite crispy which is not always the case depending on where you go.  I also second Melissa's opinion about watching all the people trying to drive the wrong way on this street, fun! The service here is fairly good, my water glass ran out once, but it was promptly refilled."}
{"text":"Brixx Pizza is, like most places situated in the Birkdale area, a great place to enjoy a meal and do some people watching.  Add in the fact that their pizza is some of the most unique and tasty around, and its a great combination.  The restaurant is located in the middle of the Birkdale area, off the main circle across from Fox and the Hound.  While the interior is comfortable and spacious, I really enjoy sitting on the patio and watching the interesting characters stroll by, of which there are usually many.   The prices are good, from $9-$11 for a personal 10\" pizza, and the wait staff has been very prompt and courteous in my experience.  Although it tends to get a bit crowded on the weekends, the wait has never been interminable, usually 15-20 minutes or so.  To me, its worth it to score one of their Roasted Chicken or Quattro Fromaggio pizzas. Yum!  Mondays are $1.50 domestic microbrews, and Wednesdays are late night Happy Hour, with a 2 for 1 deal on pizzas and appetizers from 10pm-1am.  Thursdays are $2.50 draft imports, and Sundays are 1/2 price wine days."}
{"text":"I love vegan options. Usually do take out and haven't been disappointed.the servers are very helpful and always pleasant."}
{"text":"For a casual happy hour type place, Brixx is alright. I was here in a party of 12, and was able to sample a lot of the menu. And it was pretty decent... even for this Chicago pizza loving girl.   Their zza is more flatbread style, which is great because you feel like you can eat a lot more. Bonus points for having a whole wheat crust option! I tried seven or eight varieties, and recommend their quattro formaggio and mushroom and arugula.  For those who like traditional margherita pizza, do not order the one here. You will be disappointed as it is basically a cheese pizza with tomato and basil.   While Brixx is a pizza and beer place, they also have delicious appetizers. I swear I could eat a whole order of their gorgonzola blue potato chips by myself. Yes. Please.   But the real winner here is their desserts. The pumpkin tiramisu and chocolate mousse cakes were fantastic.  Prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"Family Friendly and a Favorite of the Grand kids which makes it a favor for me  My wife's granddaughter turned 13 a couple of weeks ago while my wife was in Pittsburgh so we celebrated her birthday a week late. She got to choose the restaurant and chose Brixx in Birkdale, apparently her current favorite.   I've known of Brixx for some time now and they do have a great reputation for a very good wood fired pizza made with very fresh ingredients. Outside of the grand kids, I've the only pizza  lover in the family so this turned out to be a treat for me.  Perfect timing on meeting at the restaurant. Dropped my wife off in front while I parked the car a block away in front of Pier 1 and by the time I walked back, Reilly to birthday girl and her family had arrived and met up with my wife and were already seated. Staff was very good in keeping track and guiding me to their table.  We had an excellent server who  made sure we were well taken care of.  After looking over the menu, I ended up ordering the Tuscan Sandwich which turned out to be a great combination of fresh baked bread in the Tuscan style with various Italian Deli Meats. My wife had a Pear and Arugula Salad which she really liked. As far as Reilly and her family, they ordered 2 Pepperoni Pizzas and 1 Buffalo Chicken Pizza and that was more than they could eat so Pizza to go.  The meal was great and they seated everyone in a nice discrete place where the birthday girl could open her presents in peace and private.  I have to give this restaurant high marks. Food is excellent  and you can taste the craftsmanship behind the end product. They strive to be family friendly even to the point of being dog friendly on the outside patio and providing water dishes for our canine friends. Next time I may even bring our Corgi but he will probably be a pest because he is of the opinion that the world exists to pet him  Good spot and I do recomment"}
{"text":"Went after 10pm got boho pizza and apps. They were so so good and the service was great! Will definitely come back at this time bc there is hardly anyone there and the food comes fast."}
{"text":"This is what's sad about Charlotte. A chain restaurant with frozen pizza dough and sauce out of a can is voted the 3rd best restaurant in town?"}
{"text":"The brick oven pizza is pretty good and their salads and pasta are also great.  While the food is good and the service pretty quick beware of the crowds.  This place is packed with yuppies and their children (I am talking tons of children), so you might have to wait a little while."}
{"text":"Yes I would recommend Brixx if you are a big pizza fan. They have a lot of different kinds of pizza with toppings for every taste. The only reason I would give it a four is because their restroom isn't the finest in the world the stall doesn't lock. But their pizza is very good and you have to get there Cesar salad."}
{"text":"Next to the Bronx bomber, the rustica is my favorite. I like the option of having this on whole wheat crust, I guess it's s little healthy.  They routinely offer different flavored pizzas on the menu so stop back to see the next designed option. I like the pear Gorgonzola pizza as well as the chicken Thai pizza."}
{"text":"Love it nice  date night after he movies. Pizza is diffract. But I enjoy it' staff is friendly. Good crowd of people.  Great atmoshophere"}
{"text":"I tried....I really did... I thought maybe just maybe Champaign has turned it around and has finally opened a restaurant that serves edible food... The only saving grace was the BBQ chicken pizza... Our sever was very nice... but I am sorry I will not come back again...  Over-priced, Domino's RULES  P.S.--- Do not get the smores dessert.....#barf"}
{"text":"So I really love the pear salad it's the best ever !! Last time I went  I had a horrible experience but we're going to move past that I have the same waiter this time and things we're a lot better really the pair and arugula salad is the best  I always get that with salmon and it's nice  that they let me tweek it because I don't care for Gorgonzola cheese overall I know I will continue going because the food is really good"}
{"text":"Went their for the Four Friends Cask Event.  Had a blast!  Me and a bunch of my friends went.  It was crowded - there was a Bobcats game that night too - tons of people eating great food and drinking great local brew.  Management is friendly and staff in attentive.  I ordered the Americo (classic pepperoni and mushroom pizza)  this is my favorite and I ate all but two slices!  I recommend this place as an early evening launching spot before hitting the other places downtown."}
{"text":"I've visited Brixx twice since they opened. The first time was last week for lunch with a friend; the second time was tonight for dinner with my wife.  I have to say, that overall the service was very good and the food was something I would come back for. For my lunch visit I had the roasted chicken club sandwich on focaccia. For my dinner visit I had a pizza that was half Bronx Bomber and half Chicken Florentine.  The only reason I'm giving Brixx four stars instead of five is because the noise level this evening was absolutely unbearable. I had to yell to have a conversation with my wife, and more than once we could clearly hear the servers at other tables because they were having to yell at people at the tables. I understand that restaurants can be loud at times, but the fact that extreme noise seems to be the norm here means that I won't be coming back for dinner.  If you want to enjoy their food (which I would recommend) then do your best to come for a mid-week lunch. If you're looking for a nice place for dinner, I would skip it unless you want to feel like you're having dinner at a rock concert."}
{"text":"To be honest I wish I could give no stars based on the food, my cheese pizza had no sauce on it, and barely had any flavor. Not to mention the fact the we waited over 45 minutes for a pizza that we called in. Was told it would be ready for pick up within 10 minutes... we sat there and finally after asking again, they checked the warming drawer and there sat the pizza. The lady at the bar was super nice and apologetic but everything in the restaurant just seemed rushed and it seemed like no one had any communication with each other"}
{"text":"We ordered the Bronx Bomber. On the whole, it was a very tasteless pizza. It barely had adequate meat toppings covering the entirety of the pizza. The crust was bland, as was the sauce. I cannot recommend unless they step their sauce and pizza game.  My hubs had the Korean Meatballs. His review was simply, \"they were ok. But, it's Korean Meatballs from a pizza place.\"   It was late night and we were hungry. So giving 2 stars is for simply meeting our late night pizza emergency."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers after a morning of training and team building. To be fair, I will preface my review with I work for CMS and there were two schools worth of staff coming for lunch.   With that being said, they knew we were coming in advance, and we're a bit unorganized and chaotic. Our table got decent service, but some of our tables didn't get served at all and ended up leaving. We also had a vegetarian at our table and it took about 30 minutes for them to bring us a pizza with no meat.   The food is okay here, there were a lot of slices with no toppings on them, just crust. The salads were lettuce and a sprinkle of cheese with only two dressings offered. The flavor was good on the pies that actually had toppings on them.   The two servers that were assigned to us did a great job, seeing as there were so many of us and very few of them. The manager came out to help at the very end, but they did what they could. Thank you for serving our big group."}
{"text":"We arrived just after noon on a Thursday, the restaurant wasn't very crowded when we arrived. We were greeted after about a minute and promptly sat. Our server was in training, he was friendly and personable.  My husband and I both got the lunch special (half a pizza and half a salad for $8.95). It was the perfect amount of food and allowed us to both get exactly what we wanted on our pizzas and salad. Our son choose the kids pasta with butter.          Our food took longer than expected to come out and unfortunately our pizzas came out cold. We informed our server and he had new ones made for us. By the time our new ones came out, our son was almost done eating his pasta and was ready to leave the restaurant.  The next ones came out hot. The remade pizzas were decent, but not great...they didn't want me to rush back to the restaurant to order another pizza.  I thought the crust was okay, the sauce was a little sweet for my liking and toppings were on the light side.  Overall it wasn't a bad lunch, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice next time I'm uptown and want pizza."}
{"text":"The new interior design of the restaurant is great and I have no complaints with the updates. However, it has made this location much more smaller than it already was and you just need to learn to get cozy with your neighbors.   Brixx is a great place to come for lunch and that's about it. It doesn't have anything special on it's menu that really separates it from CPK or like Mellow Mushroom. If you are feeling a late night bite though, they do have a 1/2 special for their appetizers and pizza I believe.   I've never had a bad experience here and I don't mind coming here at all. The pizzas are average and don't really blow me away in regards to quality and serving size. I'm the type of person that wouldn't mind paying a little more to get a lot more. An example would be their barbecue chicken pizza. It's a great little pizza, but lately their chicken and cheese have started to disappear and the price hasn't gone down with it. I could go to Mellow Mushroom and pay a buck more to get a better pie with better quality food and serving sizes.  The Brixx chain in Charlotte and Lake Norman is a great place for lunch. Just don't take somebody here on a dinner date unless you really want to go home alone."}
{"text":"There had been approximately a four year hiatus between my visits to Brixx. Despite the extended time between visits, i always considered it a 3-star establishment. However, i've changed quite a bit over this time and upon my return to Brixx, i found they have always had what i never knew i would someday want. For one, they have a solid beer selection. i've always drank beer and they always have some beer on special for $3 (New Castle last time in)  which used to be all i require. Nowadays i'm a little craftier than i used to be and they satisfy with a good selection of local beers along with some nationwide favorites. Also, $1.95 domestic drafts on Monday.  The other great thing about Brixx is the fact that they offer Vegan cheese. After trying vegan pizza one time at Mellow Mushroom, i was kind of turned off. Fortunately i tried again because i think i've had it probably 5 times in the past month. Love it here. We've done the wood-roasted vegetable and a modified Mexican and will order both again. With the wood-roasted vegetable, i like to get a side of marinara for some crust dipping action. This might be why they don't get 5 stars. i don't think i've had a server remember to bring my side of marinara. Not a huge deal, but every time?   i also recommend the hummus plate as a starter. Their black bean hummus is really good.    You can park in the 7th street garage and they will validate at the hostess stand, so no need to fret about finding parking.   Apparently vegan options and good beer is all i need in life these days."}
{"text":"Had a good selection of pizzas with great flavoring on each and they do allow you to do half and half pizzas. For a good price they are personal pizzas and me and my partner got two personals each had 6 slices and shared that. Service was cool, atmosphere was pretty chill nothing too crowded or much. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and terrific patio, if you are lucky enough to get a table out there!!  Almost always busy...but worth the wait if you like pizza and live in Charlotte (not too many good ones in town, yet).  Their sandwiches and salads are also awesome...very fresh ingredients.  Couple that with a great beer selection, this is one of my favorite spots when I'm in the Dilworth area!"}
{"text":"06/16/14  My last visit to This particular Brixx had not been stellar. Today I decided to give it another try and had lunch with a coworker and three children. This experience was completely different than my first. The staff was friendly and helpful and very attentive this visit. The pizzas my friend & her family ordered were well made and not over cooked as before. I ordered the Brixx salad with salmon and I will most definitely order it again! The salmon was perfectly cooked; well-seasoned with a great sear on it.   08/24/14 I'm sitting on the patio at Brixx again, having just enjoyed a back-to-school dinner. Today I had the spinach & artichoke dip and ordered a spicy blt pizza to go. The app was great, but it's also a hard one to mess up. I tried a piece of the pizza & it was delicious! The crust was cooked to perfection & the topping melded well together. The service has again been superb & I'm very happy to see that Brixx has stepped up. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner and service tonight. They have yummy pizza and a great patio to listen to live music...."}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta is great... I love the patio and the bar a very relaxing atmosphere... The service is good and they make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Second time here after a meet-up with the Charlotte Running Group.  No pictures unfortunately, but food was good and well-presented.  My girlfriend and I tried the Rustica pizza and the Thai chicken salad.  The pizza was good - thin crust, with lots of toppings, and the perfect size for two.  The salad was a bit sweet with the satay sauce, but the pistachios were a nice touch.    In addition to the food, Brixx has a good beer selection, as well as some cool specials.  They had $2 local drafts on Monday (tried an Olde Mecklenburg brew), and they also have a Masters of Beer Appreciation (MBA) that rewards frequent drinkers (sort of the opposite of AA).   Service was good, and I will be back after more runs as we are now getting into nice weather in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Brixx is consistently good & appeals to a variety of eaters. Pizzas are all good (favorites for me are Bronx bomber, spicy BLT, and pear & Gorgonzola). Draft beer selection is good. Location is in bottom of a parking deck & they validate for free parking. Popular with the after work business crowd, pre sports events, and pre show crowds."}
{"text":"I wavered between two and three stars.  I think truthfully this is a 2.5 star place.   Nothing totally objectionable or inedible, but just not my bag.  I've been to Brixx up in Birkdale and I remember liking my salad.  I was brand new to the area and my Realtor took me there one day after looking at apartments.  Maybe I was too focused on apartment hunting to remember it clearly, but I remember liking my salad from Birkdale.  I've eaten at the uptown place twice.  Both on Saturday nights while partaking in the free trivia they offer.  Four stars for trivia, but I digress.  The first time I had a salad and bread sticks.  The bread sticks were weird.  Not a fan and I love anything vaguely resembling dough!  The salad was unremarkable.  Not good, not bad, just kinda average.  I've had better salads at Panera.  Anywho, I tried a pizza the 2nd time.  Again it was just meh, I've had some frozen pizzas that were better.  But in the same vein I've had way worse experiences.      Will I return to Brixx in uptown....sure, I love me some trivia.  But I may just drink (responsibly of course!)....don't know that I'll try the food b/c it just doesn't blow me away and both times I came away sightly disappointed.  Shout out to my server from the last time - wish I could remember her name.  Well, Brixx validates parking and somehow I lost my ticket. I went back to the garage and attempted to pull a ticket on foot, but damn garage ticket dispensers are smart.  They won't dispense a ticket w/o sensing a car is present.  Anyway I asked my server what Brixx could do b/c I was genuinely afraid of how I'd get my car out past the gates. My server gave me her ticket, validated and everything.  That was beyond.  Maybe she was conning me to get a bigger tip, but I don't care...I made sure she was taken care of.  I think my bill was $13 or so for my pizza, but I tipped her an extra $5.  She was the bomb.  ETA - Ok I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 b/c my server was awesome.  She went above and beyond.  It appears as if management reads these reviews so I really wish I remembered her name b/c she deserves kudos.  Maybe they'll figure it out/remember me (it was the night of the big Bruce Springsteen concert across the street at Time Warner).  If not, well all I can say is the service is always great and for that I'll fondly remember Brixx in uptown."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed... Was a there last night, can't understand how the place is always crowded.  The pizza sux!  It is the same taste as domino's thin crust, so if you like the taste of 1984 tops baseball cards with tasteless cheese and ketchup, be my guest.  Just an extreme waste of time if you are looking for real wood fired pizza.  Novanta 90 pizzeria three exits up in Langtree is far and away better pizza.  Brixx is a joke, don't waste ur time!  I don't write reviews often and know what real pizza is, if you are looking for the real deal, you are better off someplace else...Tony's near the North Lake Mall or Novanta in Mooresville light years ahead of the slop they serve at this bogus/imposter pizzeria!   What a waste of a brick oven!  Thanks for a complete disgrace of the word \"pizza\"... Brixx.   You couldn't pay me to eat your fake a** sh** again."}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend for a charity event.  It was absolutely packed and the bartenders were working extra hard.  I mean literally breaking a sweat!    Despite it being very crowded, the restaurant stayed clean and cool!    We ordered a Margarita pizza which was freaking delicious.  Every ingredient was fresh and tasty.  Even the mozzerella was fresh, not the shredded typical stuff.  I would definitely order this pizza again.  Although this time I did not order a salad, I have in the past ordered the Brixx Salad and it is also quite excellent.    The price point is nice on the wallet.  Our pizza was $9.95 and can easily serve 2 people for dinner.    In terms of atmosphere, it is more casual but in a classy, Italian way, not a sports bar type of way.  I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my daughter. This Brixx's food consistent and friendly staff! Love their Brixx salad with fire roasted chicken. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ok, maybe 2 1/2 stars max.   The place has a familiar feeling even on the first visit, comfy enough. Drinks ain't bad but the pizza is a major let down. This \"California pizza wanna be\" is cheaper and the pizza comes out much faster ... but it doesn't rank.   First off the selection is limited, it looks like half of the choices are chicken this and chicken that. Sorry not interested.   Then it gets worse, IMHO the whole point of brick ovens is to get the dough crispy without overcooking the toppings. No joy here either. Both pizzas were undercooked leaving the crust doughy and spongy. The mushroom pizza was so undercooked that cheese shavings never melted. The tomato-basil was better but still undercooked.   To make things worse the waiter didn't seem to like unhappy costumers, he offered to get us the bill while we were still eating and I hadn't even finished my Martini.   Fail"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal and time dining on the patio. The server was great, the food was decent, using lots of fresh herbs. The beer selection was great, as well as the half price bottles of wine. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pricey and food is mediocre. I got the lunch special (Half pizza and salad for $8) and breadsticks. The cesaer salad was slightly soggy and had a bunch of pieces of the heart of the romaine which I normally don't see in the salads. The 4x4 pizza was alright but could have used some sauce. Breadsticks were meh and same with the marinara sauce it came with. The atmosphere was cool and well done. The service was pretty good too. Overall, not impressed because of the food."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are very good, as are the appetizers I have tried. They need to include more pita with the hummus, there is never enough. They offer a good selection of rotating draft beers, with a nice variety of local offerings. Service is usually good, although occasionally you get a dud. Traffic and parking can be a pain in Birkdale, so it is usually somewhere that I will eat if I'm already there but not a destination."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick family lunch or dinner or when hanging out with the kids at the Blakeny playground or fountain. It's a local take on the CPK concept of personal size pizza and trendy ingredients.  The service has been excellent the many times that I have been here, and the food and beer selection is decent too. The only thing where I feel they fall short is in the inconsistency of the quality of their pizza. Sometimes is really good and others is not. They seem to put the minimum amount of ingredients possible. There have been times when I can count the pepperoni slices in one hand or I will get a pizza without hardly any cheese on it."}
{"text":"First night in Charlotte downtown.  Went here for a late night dinner. At 9:00 on this Wednesday night this place had several guests sitting outside and a few inside.    I ordered the bourbon chicken pizza. It was a brick fired oven pizza, thin crust, crispy and delicious.  Service was good and the prices were responsible."}
{"text":"I love Brixx, but this location needs to get it together. Brought the whole fam in last night. After the hostess took us to a dirty table (\"I guess I can wipe it down for you\"), we sat for 10-15 minutes without being greeted by a server, as several helped tables around us without speaking and we watched one lean into the kitchen window and have a long casual convo. When our server finally came out, she couldn't tell us what beers were on tap because she was \"too new\" which begged the question of why she was on the floor by herself. We ordered drinks, she brought the kids' sodas, then went to \"check on\" our beers. She never reappeared. We watched staff crowd around the bar computer with what appeared to be the manager, looking puzzled and frustrated with a handful of tickets that seemed have issues. At this point, we'd been sitting for 30 minutes and had not even gotten our full drink order, so we decided to cut our losses and leave."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on November 30th. 1st time at this location near Southpark. I got the veggie pizza with arugula. FANTASTIC. Service was great and the manager even came to our table several time. I also love their crust. Had to finish up with the Tiramisu. Also great. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad. First, they had Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, which always pops you up a star in my book. Came here with my wife and her lady friends and a bunch of babies. Our server was able to handle it all well. I ordered the pimento cheese pizza which was surprisingly light and refreshing. When you think pimento cheese you think rich and filling, but this was nothing but. Others ordered the Bronx Bomber, which was good although I'm not a huge prosciutto fan. Another ordered the 4x4: 4 meats 4 cheeses: awesome. My wife got a salad. Boo! But it wasn't bad, it was something asian-themed or something. Decent, straight down the middle of the plate pizza. Probably a zillion locations."}
{"text":"Went to try out Brixx for the first time and you figure at 7pm on a Saturday night you are going to have to wait at least 45 min. to get into any good restaurant so I was pleasantly surpised when I put in my name at Brixx they said it would be about 25-35 min.  and I'm sure you are thinking, yeah they tell you that but they will make you wait for at least 50 before you get a seat.  Not true! We got a seat at 7:25.  For our dinner we had the Gorgonzola chips for a starter, they were soooo... good! Blue tera chips smothered in cheese sauce with a little hot sauce around the edge in case you want a little heat, yum.  Then, I recommend if this is your first time, that everyone in your party get a different flavor pizza so you can all swap pieces to get a variety.  Truthfully, my husband and I could have had our appetizer and share a pizza but that would take all the fun out of it.  Instead I got the mexican pizza and he got the bacon cheese burger pizza. My mexican pizza was great, I love spicy so the jalapenos offered a nice kick to the pizza.  My husband felt his would have been better with a cheese or ketchup based sauce instead of the regular pizza sauce that was used.  Overall we had a great exprience and can't wait to come back to try their other pizzas."}
{"text":"If you're looking for classic pizza...don't come here. They offer some really interesting and delicious flavor combinations. They are all personal size and are offered regular or whole wheat crust. You are also allowed to order the pizza half and half, which we took advantage of. From the group of us we had Thai chicken, buffalo chicken, greek, meat works, mexican and white zucchini.  No complaints from a table of 8. My favorite was the thai chicken it had pistachio nuts on it...nothing I would ever of thought to put on a pizza. It was great."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Jerk chicken pizza is the best one! Today I went and Evan was an amazing server.  I left my phone there and because of him I got it back. You don't get honesty like that anymore. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lots of gluten free options and vegan cheese. Good but thin pizza with hardly any toppings.  Would go back but would order extra toppings. Chicken breast on salad was just ok...med quality."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte on and off for 15 years. In that time, I've never been to Brixx, so I was pretty excited to try it for the first time. I came for lunch and noticed how empty the place was. And quickly figured out why.  The hostess sat us and we waited....and waited....and waited....and left after no server ever came to our table. I guess Brixx was more interested in a one-star review than my money. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here with my school and it took an hour and 40 minutes to leave. The waitress was rude in addition it took her 30 minutes to come get our order. The lady took out order and than it took another 30 minutes to get our food. When the first dish arrived it took another 5 minutes till the next dish came and another 5 minutes till the next and so on. They brought the wrong food. By the time we were done instead of bringing separate checks, she brought one big one. Not impressed, will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, the atmosphere, and location.  The Buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite and the Pita chips and 3 dips are great appetizers.  The beer selection is great, with lots of craft beer on draft.  It's a great place to eat, drink, relax, and watch sports for a reasonable price.  They also have a great late night happy hour specials.  They used to offer an MBA (masters of beer appreciation) there, but unfortunately, I think that got discontinued."}
{"text":"Just some info...All pizzas are (small) 10\". They fit on a dinner plate.... We went with a group of 6 and had to order 5 pizza's.  They range from $10-$14 each.  The pizza's were just OK and the service was lacking.  Also they no longer offer WI-FI in their store for our kids to play on their tablets.  They did have a good beer selection.    This place could improve by:  Offering bigger pizzas for families Coming up with better pizza crust Hire better servers Offer WI-FI More reasonably price their small pizzas"}
{"text":"Brixx is a nice little restaurant to go to on a summer night. We were seated quick and we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip that is served with crostinis. We also ordered a small pizza and a pasta. We had the roasted chicken pizza and the pasta pomodoro. We were so full from the crostini and the pizza that we had to pack the pasta to go."}
{"text":"Did the Tuesday coupon deal after 5pm: buy two entrees get two free. We selected 4 pizzas. The ones we tried to finish on site were very good. Meatball and artichoke pesto. Sausage and margarita we took home for the next day's lunch. Clearly pizza overload. While this place isn't much to speak about inside, it's ok. Good draft beer selection and very friendly, efficient server. The fact we used a coupon did not affect our order or service. Next time will try a pasta and pizza to avoid pizza overload."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time. Pizzas are done well, thin crust and crispy. Roast chicken sandwich on Focaccia is just OK. Lots of bread and chicken is placed in the center of the sandwich that visually appears to be more than their actually is. This evident when you open the sandwich. Roasted chicken taste wasn't that great. Not great flavors-would not order again.  Service was fine very accommodating. You can certainly get an OK lunch here, just trying to set expectations."}
{"text":"Got the wood grilled wing with the rosemary garlic sauce with celery to dip in the Gorgonzola dip. Along with the Greek salad with house made feta cheese dressing. Great keto meal."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I was really looking forward to eating the Greek pizza. It was great but I haven't gotten any service since I received my pizza and I am finished eating now. No napkins and no tea refill and I am being so ignored I could walk out since I haven't received the check either.  Another place I have tried and can check off my list now!"}
{"text":"Basically this is a chain restaurant, serving mediocre overpriced food, with an extremely slow unfriendly wait staff.  It's bad when the appetizers beat the first round of beers to the table. However I realize this could be a bartender problem...  I recommend coming here at least once to test out the waters.  There aren't much better options to choose from in Gaston county."}
{"text":"Was recommended but the staff at Holiday Inn which is across the street. They raved about it.  I on the other hand do not. It was okay but not great. Fuel on the other side of the hotel (Collge street) is better."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Brixx for the past year and a half, and it feels like the set of Cheers. The staff are great, very down to earth and the kind of people you enjoy getting to know and shooting the shit with at the bar.   Mondays and Thursdays are beer special nights, so of course I would recommend this to those both inclined towards tasty brews and pinching pennies.   The pizzas and pastas are delish-- among my favorites pizzas, the prosciutto and pineapple Hawaiian is the best.   This particular location of Brixx is convenient for those living in South Charlotte and the Ballantyne area, as well as those in Weddington, Marvin, and Waxhaw.   The atmosphere is very chill-- dim lighting without being overly dramatic, and plenty of TVs posted up for everyone interested in watching the football or basketball game. Dress is is very casual. The evening crowd differs greatly in my experience than the day time crowd; the latter usually attracts families and children whereas the evening crowd is college age and up.   Brixx is awesome, especially this location! Check it out! Especially Monday evenings for the 2 buck pint night of delicious beer on tap!"}
{"text":"My friend and I flew in from Portland, Oregon around 7ish on a Thursday night. We got to our airbnb around 9:00 and several restaurants we were interested in were already closing. All we knew was that we wanted something fast. Brixx happened to be the first restaurant we encountered on our walk so we went inside. We got the Korean meatballs, Bourbon pizza, and an alfredo dish. Korean meatballs tasted like normal meatballs with a sweet asian sauce poured on top and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was alright. The pizza was not to my liking. Much too sweet so I only had a bite of that. The alfredo left much to be desired. It didn't have any flavor, which I didn't mind. I was taking one of my board exams the next day and didn't want anything that would upset my stomach, so bland was good for me. The server who served us wasn't super friendly, but she wasn't rude either. Overall I would say the main draw is the restaurant's aesthetics. Cute lighting outside and spacious interior. Unfortunately I was expecting a little more from my first meal in North Carolina....."}
{"text":"The pizza was good ... but I ordered a whole pizza not realizing there was a lunch special of a salad with a half pizza. The waitress only told us we could get different toppings on half of a whole pizza. On our way out I noticed the table near us getting salads and half pizzas and asked about it. The waitress then told us it wasn't on the menu but was posted \"somewhere near the door.\". Yeah ... on the side window so you don't see it if you are looking straight ahead; it wasn't on the daily specials list either. I feel like she deliberately failed to mention it so our bill would be larger and therefore her tip as well.  Right now I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in in the middle of a Saturday of leisurely shopping & window browsing while at Birkdale. My friend and I made a stop right after the lunch rush and right before the dinner rush so we were able to have our pick of seating.   We were seated and informed of the drink special which was a summer ale for $2. Bingo, bango! As for pizza, I went with the meatball on whole wheat crust.  Now since I'd been to Brixx a few times before, I knew what to expect with the pizza. I'm from New Jersey so, yes, I'm a pizza snob. The good thing about Brixx is that they let you know that this isn't your 'typical' pizza/pizza pie....I just wish the pizza was a tad more crisp. The slices were quite weak, probably a mixture of the heavy toppings and weak crust.  Decent pizza and drinks; don't expect anything more or anything less."}
{"text":"First off decor is soo bright I must be in a mall! And where's the damn wood fired pizza oven! Isn't that the center piece of your business! Guess not. Oh and since when is it all cozy and nice for the waitresses to sit and take my order? I'm old school act professional, not cutesy! Menu not a single Chicken oriented item on the app menu! Don't care what anyone says! If it ain't on there! You're screwed! Menu choices were OK but where's the ala Carter pizza choices! Crust on the pizza was terrible one was burnt other one was half cooked. Not impressed in the least ! Spent too many years in restaurants to spend that much money on a so so pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I've had Brixx twice this week.  The food was good, one night was much better than the next! I would think different cooks?  The chicken sandwich was excellent and the buffalo pizza would only be better with more blue cheese(paid for extra??)!!"}
{"text":"Brixx is consistently one of the most disappointing pizza places in town (all locations). Service and beer selection are great but the pizza is mediocre at best on a good night. 10 years or so ago it was great pizza loaded with toppings then at some point they decided to skimp on the toppings, cheese and sauce making the pizza 80% crust. If I wanted bread I'd go to the grocery store."}
{"text":"My wife and I are return customers and have never been disappointed. We only buy pizza. She has pepperoni and prosciutto. I have pepperoni and Italian sausage. Consistently great food and service. We sit at the bar in order to watch television and faster service than table. She drinks Coke and I, unsweetened tea. The tea is not watered down and taste like tea. The bartender on this day was JEFF S.. He was very friendly and fast. I recommend this location for brick oven pizza."}
{"text":"We have really been enjoying Brixx for late night dates. It's quiet and intimate. Servers are always awesome. Food is so good. I love there bruschetta! So delicious. I always get the sweet Thai chicken. My husband is more adventurous and tries a new one each time we go.    Just thinking of there delicious pizza makes me want this for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"As always, awesome pizza. We had the Chicken Florentine and the Grilled chicken pizza. Very satisfying and paired well with the OMB Captain Jack Pilsner. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Lots happening in downtown Charlotte St. Patrick's weekend, and this place was packed.  The hostess told us we could not sit outside but we could sit by the window \"which is the same thing\" - huh?   Great beer selection and a very good Greek salad. The wild mushroom and arugula pizza was \"missing\" something.  The crust was chewy and not tough but the toppings were bland and I didn't see a wild mushroom anywhere on the plate (just white button). The server charged us for the wrong check. 24 hours later both charges are still on my Amex.  Just an average lunch stop."}
{"text":"Came with friends and Sara was our waitress and was fantastic server. The food was very tasty I had hummus brixx salad and my wife had mushroom pizza. I would return to have Sara take care of us. Thanks"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in Brixx. I ordered the thai chicken pizza and my SO ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. They both were almost flavorless. I picked the thai chicken pizza because it has goat cheese on it and there were maybe 3 little globs of it on the whole pizza. My SO picked the buffalo chicken because it came with gorgonzola and he could barely taste it. I did like the crust, but both pizzas were totally forgettable. Also, the price and proportions seemed off. One pizza wouldn't have been quite enough for both of us but two pizzas was way too much. I thought it was a bit too pricey for what we got at about ~$12 a pizza. The atmosphere and the service were fine. Didn't hate it overall but definitely won't be going back. There are a lot of better pizza options in town."}
{"text":"FOOD - Bruschetta: roma and sundried tomates topped with fresh mozzarella over focaccia and drizzled with balsamic glaze. Delicious. Huge portion. 4/5  - Turkey Wrap: sliced turkey with artichoke, roma tomatoes, lettuce, and aioli, wrapped in flat bread, topped with parmesan with a side of chips. Huge wrap! Good but not great. 3/5  SERVICE  Fast and friendly. Our waitress stopped by a few times to check up on us. 4/5  FINAL THOUGHTS I would definitely come back to try other things."}
{"text":"I've been to Brixx 2 times in the past month. Both were quite similar. I get the barbecue chicken pizza, and it's pretty good, although I wish they would lay off on all of the cheese--it feels like I'm just eating a heart attack. The Brixx Salad is pretty good, too. The lunch special, as another review mentioned, is a great deal if you go to lunch. Overall, pizza is good, service is good, prices are good, and location is exceptional. I'll definitely return when I'm in the mood for food at Blakeney."}
{"text":"The Dilworth location is great for sitting on the patio, hanging out and having a Blue Moon and an appetizer. I'd highly recommend the spinach and artichoke dip. The thin-crust, wood-fired pizza is good, but it's certainly not the best in Charlotte. (I'd say Wolfman is the best.) I like both the Margherita and Quattro Fromaggio pizzas.   I've generally had good service there, but the other day was an exception. The waiter forgot our drink orders and had to double check with us, never brought me water I asked for, then entered the wrong appetizer in the computer. When we got the wrong order, he and the other servers quickly got us the right one. Then the bill included both appetizers and we had to get that fixed. Still, he was apologetic and fixed the mistakes, so it didn't do much to tarnish my otherwise good opinion."}
{"text":"It was okay. My friend has a dinner here for her grad for a group of 11, we all sat at different tables because there wasn't enough space to accommodate us all at one table. So we each had different servers too. Ohhhh myyyyy gooooooood, I don't even think we even had a server tbh because he was nowhere to be seen 90% of the time & he was hecka slow! Our water glass was also empty for too long. I understood that it was a busy night, but he could've checked up on us a few times. I was going to order a pizza, but after seeing that it was about 1000 calories for one pizza I was too shook! So I just settled for the veggie sandwich with a side of chips. Chips were okay, the sandwich was pretty good! I tried a piece of my friends pizza the Americo and I don't think it's worth the 1000 calories lol. It was okay, tasted like regular pizza. Overall I don't think I would be back .. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because I hate giving low ratings but!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  You know when the the chain-smoking carnie running the Zipper yells to his toothless meth-mouth wench girlfriend at the ring-toss game to ask if she accidentally drank his dip juice again while everyone on the Zipper is either getting to second base or puking on the girl next to them in those little spinning cages? I think that couple might like this joint. It's just awful enough to make you feel worn down and dirty.  Remember that kid who climbed into the sewer pipe and swam with the turds for 36 hours until emergency crews dug a relief well and pulled him out? That freaking kid runs the kitchen at this place. Seriously. He calls the food, \"disaster themed.\"  Staffed by friendly neophytes slinging ugly, foul-tasting mishmash. One and done on this joint, man."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to either this location or the chain.  I doubt if I will return and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone who hasn't been to one before.  I ordered a pizza and a 'side salad'.  The latter was apparently not on the menu, so I didn't know what it included.  While I'm not nut adverse, there were nuts in the salad and the server didn't say anything about it.  Likewise, the server wasn't helpful with the menu -- but, I was dining alone -- bad me!  The pizza and the salad were delivered together after a longish wait.  The food was worth 3 - 4 stars, but the service and the price bring it right back down to earth"}
{"text":"The Brixx location near the Time Warner Cable Arena gets two thumbs up from me! Stopped in for lunch before the Charlotte Checkers home opener and we were seated right away. Very convenient to park and walk between the arena and here.   I had been to Brixx a few times before I was gluten free and have always been interested in trying their gluten free pizza. I was pretty impressed with their gluten free menu overall. It was very specific and easy to read. They offer not one, not two but THREE gluten free bottled beers, and I'm not talking cider here. Actual GF beer. I ordered the wood roasted vegetable pizza and it was quite yummy. Huge portion, I actually shared it with my non GF friend who only ordered a salad. They also cooked it in it's own pan, I'm guessing to help avoid contamination.   I was a bit of a problem child. I asked our server for the gluten free menu and then ordered a pizza but I think I forgot to specify that I wanted it gluten free. Totally my mistake, I always try to be 100% clear when ordering and specifying the gluten free option when there is one. So I received a pizza that looked very similar to one of my other friends, and I asked. It was not gluten free. Our server Chad was very nice about it, took it away and got a new pizza started. The manager then brought me a side salad so I wouldn't feel \"left out\" while my friends ate. I made sure to tell him that it was not the servers fault (I was afraid he'd get in trouble!) and that I would gladly pay for the non GF pizza. He was very understanding and did not charge me for the salad or the extra pizza.   So thanks Brixx for being awesome to this gluten free girl who was a bit lazy when ordering!"}
{"text":"We've ate here on several occasions and ordered carryout many more.  The food is always fantastic and the service is always prompt.  In fact, when ordering for take out, it literally takes 10 minutes form the time you order.  We've tried an array of their pizza's and salads and have always enjoyed them.  Our favorite would have to be the buffalo chicken pizza on a whole wheat crust, and their Caesar salad.    Their pizza is a thin-crust style pizza cooked in a brick oven --hence the name.  They use a real light sauce and they don't bury it in cheese like most of the more commercial Hut-type stores.  This location is nice and clean and always looks presentable.  I've never seen it too busy, and if we've had to wait, its only been for a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Pizza was absolutely delicious best by far for Gastonia will be returning with the rest of my family"}
{"text":"Man the people that give this place anything above a 2 star review haven't had good pizza apparently. We got the 4x4 and chicken florentine. Both super bland and dry. The 4x4 was \"supposed\" to be loaded with meat but the entire pizza had only a couple pieces of meat. More cheese than anything. The florentine had no flavor at all. The chicken was dry as can be. It was like chewing thru cardboard. This pizza is literally comparable to cicis buffet and to be honest for the money you're better off going to cicis. Not to mention our server came by once to take our order and then at the end to pick up the check. I had to get this other girl working to get us plates, straws and refills which were empty for several minutes which really sucked as I tried to swallow the extra dry and bland pizza down my throat. Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"As far as a pizza place goes I think brixx's is my favorite. I've been to plenty of them and their menu is great! I think I've tried almost everything they have to offer and would be hard pressed to pick a favorite. Not to mention great salads and a good beer selection on tap. This location has a nice outdoor seating area and stays busy."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Based on the crowds I've seen at this place during the weekend I imagined it would be a good spot for pizza, not the case.    Clearly the folks in the area don't know what good pizza is and neither does Brixx. We went during the week so it was pretty empty, so it was very puzzling as to why the service sucked so much. Our server Devin was clearly distracted and not very attentive. She was not helpful and seemed to have a lot on her mind. The manager however was very nice and seemed to be more concerned with her table as he asked us a couple of times how we were doing.    Our server never asked us how our meal was nor did she come by for refills. She also added a free appetizer to the bill which she had to correct. I ALWAYS order dessert when we go out, except when the server brings the bill without giving me the option of dessert.   After paying the bill, I asked Devin for a coke to go and she seemed bothered, she returned a few minutes later and slid the coke onto the table which was very unprofessional.    Based on the service I won't return. It also doesn't help that the food is subpar. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"After biking across town AND busting my ass in spin class, I'm hungry. So on one of these occasions, I met my coworkers at Brixx after hearing good things. The place was not busy (8pm-ish, weeknight) so they seated us right away and the staff was very attentive. They kept our drinks filled the whole time we were there and stopped by to check on us. The menu consists of 10\" pizzas, pasta, salads, starters, and a variety of drinks. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a decent beer & wine selection. They even have a short list of cocktails (which I didn't try so I can't tell if they're made well). We started with breadsticks ($6 for 6 breadsticks), which came with honey mustard & marinara dipping sauces. It was ok. I ordered a pizza ($12) - half Carribean Jerk Chicken & half Sweet Thai Chicken - which I dubbed The Sweet Jerk, which is what my coworkers probably think I am when I get sarcastic while offering them cookies. Since I'm thinking about cookies & desserts, they do have a S'mores Pizza on the menu. Didn't try it but took note for when I come back to this place. But back to the pizza I actually ordered... It was delicious - chewy & crisp crust, generous toppings, nice combination of flavors for both halves. We also found out that pizzas & appetisers are BOGO after 10pm, Sundays through Thursdays! (We were so close... 9pm) It was tasty but that could have something to do with being hungry after hours of biking. But being so close to the office, I will likely be back for [s']more[s]."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the apartments next door to Brixx. Never been less than happy here. I'm not sure who the manager on staff was, but what a nice man.....he makes it feel very \"cheers-esque\" in there. Picked up a pizza last night after a little too much fun on a sunday. The people who have cashed me out there have never been anything short of very kind. BONUS: you can buy bottles of wine to go on half price wine night?! SCORE.  My ONLY reason for 4 stars is size of pizza. Sometimes I just want a really huge pizza to myself, ya know?! Kevin McAllister style."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here- love that they have gluten free options.  Folks were friendly, rest rooms were clean and a great experience was had by all."}
{"text":"(edited to tone it down)  Pros:  - Pizza is great - Beer specials on Mondays are awesome.  Con:  - The restaurant can be a playground for screaming children.   I'm just trying to eat, have a beer, talk, and watch the game. I don't want to deal with a bunch of screaming kids running all over the place and fighting over the arcade game in the corner. Even the great beer specials on Mondays are not worth listening to that.   It must be noted that there is only so much the management can do about other peoples' children. Their parents should manage the volume - but I think some just become habituated to it.  Maybe it's not like that every night. But we have noticed it twice.  If you eat here, just ask to be seated in the corner farthest from the arcade game, unless you enjoy the sound of shrieking children after working all day.  Obviously, if you have kids, they're a family-friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Located conveniently in the heart of Birkdale Village, Brixx is one of a handful of restaurants often suggested by my co-workers for lunch because of it's centralized location.   The pizza here isn't bad, but by no means is it excellent. It falls somewhere between the lines of frozen pizza and your typical delivery chain like Dominoes or Jet's. On my first visit, my friends and I split a Bufflao Chicken pizza and a BBQ Chicken pizza. We found the buffalo chicken pizza to be extremely dry and bland. It lacked the heat that we were expecting, and we had to ask for a side of buffalo sauce to make it edible. The BBQ Chicken pizza was slightly better, but that's it. It was just average. On a second visit, I ordered the Bronx Bomber. While good, for $11 I expect a delicious, unique pizza, but what I received was a relatively small pizza that lacked the flavor one would expect when ordering a gourmet pizza.   Service here is good, and I've never had to wait to get a table, but that may be because I only come during lunch. If you're in the Birkdale area and looking for some quick pizza, Brixx could be a good choice. Otherwise, I'd recommend just ordering in."}
{"text":"Nice, Trandy place to have pizza. Went there with husband in a Saturday afternoon, not cowdy, which is nice. food was good, Waiter was friendly and like to joke around, very easy going atmosphere. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Nice place, nice location......i had roast beef sandwich, it was \"good\"... not worth another trip, wife had Americano pizza, came with a hair in it, they made another quickly and comped pizza....she enjoyed the pizza (without hair!) i wasnt impressed.....server was very nice, prices were good, ( i must add iam not a thin pizza fan-- probably adds to my part of the review)....server noted, they were going to have cook wear a beard net from now on...."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight. Everyone from the hostess to the server provided excellent service and the food was delicious. Everything tasted really fresh. The dough on the pizzas was the perfect blend between crunchy and soft. Also tried the Brixx sticks as an appetizer which again was fresh and flavorful. The place was pretty crowded for a weekday evening but there wasn't any wait. Had a good time."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Rustica pizza is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival I was met by Bri, the beautiful and caring bartender. I asked what the cheapest beer would be, and she politely gave me a menu and said bud light. She was also kind enough to pour it in a cold glass so everyone else wouldn't recognize my disgusting taste of beverage. I had a couple and ordered a pizza which was delicious. Bri offered my check with a smile and I took off. Would definitely repeat service!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I met here for lunch today, service was amazing due to the great attention from our waiter J.t. I think it was! Food was great as were the portions and prices! We each got a pizza and we got the spinach artichoke dip to share. All of the food was great! Hubby got the wild mushroom pizza, I got the Mexican and Americano halved.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot for dinner and a beer.  They have a great selection of draft beers, and some amazing specials.  Mondays every beer is $1.95!  They have $2.50 and $3 specials most weeknights, too.  I love that every pizza on the menu can be completely customized, and they won't charge you an extra buck for an extra topping or whatever.  A few of my favorites after visiting this location over the past 8 or so years:  Pear and Gorgonzola pizza - this is SO GOOD.  I often order a side of marinara to dip the crust in to get that tomato taste I often crave with pizza, since this one is an olive oil base, and not traditional sauce.  Mexican pizza, no meat, with extra black beans - They never put enough black beans on it, but it's a fantastic pizza!  The new Fiesta pizza is also really good.  I like to add sour creme to it.  I was skeptical of a corn salsa on pizza, but I really like it a lot!  It's got good heat in the red pepper pesto."}
{"text":"Brixx never fails to impress me.  First time at this location, but it was just as perfect as the one in my city (Greenville, SC).  Our server, Dale, was awesome, quick, so friendly, and everything you would want out of a server at a restaurant.   We came in late after spending the day at carrowinds, so needless to I was so thirty and he kept my water filled!!  Then....the food was so delicious.  We all got a different pizza, and shared a piece with each other.  Every one was something I would come back and order.  Thanks for the great experience Brixx!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced.Service is usually decent but unless you do BOGO after 9pm, plan on spending some $$. If I had payed menu prices for some of the stuff that came to my table I would have felt terrible.Burned pizza, spotty service."}
{"text":"Our small family tried Brixx tonight. We love wood-fire brick-oven pizza. Two of us had the pizza and one of us tried the meatball sub with black bean salad. We also tried the Korean bbq meatball appetizer, and I had a Brixx house salad as a side.   Neither pizza lover gave Brixx pizza top marks. The crust was not especially crispy. The blackening on the bottom lent a bitter flavor. To the good, the ingredients were high quality. I loved the pear-gorgonzola topping with walnuts and carmelized onions, although the onions were sauteed at best and not at all carmelized (they were out of the butternut squash-goat cheese pizza, so this was my second pick). The more traditional cheese pizza was just passable.   The Korean bbq meatball appetizer did not taste Korean (and I'm a Korean food lover), and came with pineapples chopped up as a garnish -- it didn't go with the flavor profile of the meatballs, but it didn't fight against it either. The meatballs were tender and tasty in a generic way. The side salad was good, too, with goat cheese and pistachios. It hadn't been seasoned and the dressing wasn't balanced (too little acid in the vinaigrette).   The meatball sub could not be held, and that's a pet peeve of ours. If you can't pick it up, it's not a sandwich. The toppings were somewhat off-putting in terms of texture, but the meatballs were good, with Italian seasoning. The bean salad side received a 7.2 out of 10. Good but not great.  The music was on too loud and the tables were not well cleared or cleaned. Our waitress was the only one on duty when we arrived and the place was filling up, but there seemed to be a lot of other staff. She was good and friendly, but overtaxed.   The place has double sets of doors, but the inside doors were open. Hard to know why. Restaurant staff should be aware that this lets in flies, and sure enough, it did.  We didn't feel cheated, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Once again Brixx provides solid food with a nice atmosphere. I've never had a bad meal here, probably because I stick with the pizzas. My wife had a salad which was ok but not great. FYI, this place is a hidden gem for local craft beers at very good prices!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was very good and they're different varieties than the normal. Also they have BOGO nights. Always love a deal"}
{"text":"Salad was not good.  Service was fine, but payment took a while.  I would not recommend anything other than the pizza."}
{"text":"Brixx gets five stars from me for it's fantastic faux cheese. It's a rare and wonderful thing to find a fake cheese that isn't nasty. Not only is the brand Brixx carries not nasty...it's actually quite good. It's convincing enough as a fake cheese that the first time I had it, I asked the server to double-check. I was convinced I'd been cheesed inadvertently.   The salads are great, and there are lots of good appetizers. I've had some good experiences taking family there, especially when there's a variety of picky eaters coming out. There's a little something for everyone.  It can get a little busy, which slows down the service, but I haven't had the kind of bad experience that Emilie P. had. I've always found the servers to be friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Holy cow, it is hard to make a bad pizza, but Brixx has done it. I like to consider myself a pizza ninja - but this, just not good. Bland. Ordered two pies to take to Triptych brewing (awesome), got there and the flop on these pieces of pizza was insane. CRISP IT UP BRIXX, that crust needs crisp - maybe its my rookie mistake for not knowing to ask for it well done...?   However - the friendly people on the phone (Ed, thats you my man!)  and I didnt catch the guys name when i picked up - were very great/awesome/friendly/patient/informative. If only the pizza reflected your attitudes!!   Cheers"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good but this review is about the server we had Johntel. I'm not joking when I say Johntel was easily one of the, if not the best server I've ever had in my entire life. He was such a genuine soul who really cared about our experience and Brixx. He was attentive and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. I was so impressed with him!! I can't say enough good things about my experience at Brixx!"}
{"text":"Had the worst service I've ever experienced at this location. The hostesses were sitting by the door chatting and ignoring everyone who walked in the door. Our server was distant and we waited 20 minutes after we finished eating to even be asked if we wanted a box or the check, in addition the server failed to remove our dirty plates from he table until after we left. Best part was that the food was average."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was delicious. The food came in a timely manner, and the waitress was very kind. We ordered an appetizer, three pizzas, and a desert. All were delicious! Fun fact: any added toppings to your pizza are free ;)"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Food is so good! Love the gluten free pizza! Friendly staff and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, so disappointed. For $18 bucks I ordered was was supposed to be a large pizza...4 tiny slices of paper thin pizza and an order of breadstick- came with 6 plain tasting dough sticks. I cant believe the ridiculous high price and the baby tiny size of food you get. My margarita pizza had like 10 tomatoes and 3 pieces of basil on it, the saddest looking pizza in the word. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fun atmosphere! I have had the Bronx Bomber pizza, the Chicken Florentine pizza and some of my wife's salad and all were amazing. They have decent beer options too. I definitely plan to become a regular."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Love their pizza. I usually come a few times a year. I love the location too. Dilworth is my fav area. The server was nice and attentive. Easy parking. Short wait. Fresh food. I always order the same thing. I made a mistake and forgot to ask for the Florentine pizza minus the bacon. I felt so bad I forgot that but I can't eat pork. They remade it for me with no problem and it came out pretty quick. I always eat out and good customer service is no longer a given. So I appreciate when I receive great service. Def had to acknowledge it. Will def go back."}
{"text":"One word....delicious!!!  Quite different from Dominos and Papa Johns. We split the breadsticks and Korean Meatballs appetizer, both were excellent. Wife had the Bronx Bomber, I had the 4 x 4, and kids had Americo without mushrooms. Service was excellent and restaurant was really nice."}
{"text":"I love all Brixx locations however this one is ESPECIALLY cool because it was recently remodeled and now has a gorgeous partial patio cover.  The best thing about this location is sitting on the patio watching all of the drivers try to drive the wrong way down one-way Scott Ave.  Sigh.....half price bottles of wine and much giggling later, it is a great way to spend a Sunday evening.  The service at this location has always been attentive and extra sweet.  This is the first Brixx I ever came to in Charlotte and fell IN LOVE with the Mexican pizza.  No Amstel or Heineken here but I love you anyways Brixx!"}
{"text":"Super fast service!!!  I love all the Brixx locations and this one is no exception.  Yes it is a little not-so-glamorous to have the patio view of a parking garage and street but it is so convenient since it is right on 6th street Uptown.    I have never had a bad thing on the menu - the Pesto Chicken Salad is what I had here recently and it was delish!!!  Candied walnuts really make the difference.  Super fresh fruit on the salad - it was so much I couldnt finish it all!  Great prices and awesome service!  Park at the 7th Street station and they will validate you!!!"}
{"text":"Listen to my story bout a man named Ed, poor korean mofo hardly kept his family fed. Then one day he was starvin for some food so they loaded up the car and went to brixx pizza.   Food that is, pizza piea, and korean meatballs and turkey wrap.  It was all good!  But the  pineapples were a bit odd tasting."}
{"text":"Maybe I have ate at Brixx to many times, maybe I am to much of a pizza snob. Is Brixx good? sure. Is it great? No not by any means. They do have semi creative pizza on their menu but ive never had anything that flat out wowed me. I usually go for the Bronx Bomber because I like the prosciutto. My favorite part about Brixx though is being able to get a flight of beer and how it seems their beer is always changing up so I can always get something new."}
{"text":"I want to love this place more than I do. It was fine but really nothing special. I love that they allow you to do half and half on the pizzas and they are fine just nothing that blew my socks off. $3 margaritas were good, service was good. Everything was just solid."}
{"text":"I may have a new favorite pizza place in the C-U area.  Plus I was impressed by the draft beer selection and the beer prices.  One of my dining companions had the hummus and we were very pleasantly surprised. I snuck a bite of a another companion's pasta, and that was good too."}
{"text":"You have to get the tai chicken pizza it was amazing. I cant wait to get it again. They have the perfect mix of all ingredients for a perfectly balanced pizza. MMMMM"}
{"text":"Ideally located and tasty food in an enjoyable ambience with excellent service. If you are a vegetarian like me, you are sure to find great salads, appetizers, pizzas, pastas and sandwiches here. My personal favorites - Spinach Artichoke Dip with the Garlic Crostini, Pasta Pomodoro, Margherita Pizza"}
{"text":"I had a bite of the buffalo chicken pizza at Taste of Charlotte this year. It was good, and what you'd expect from a wood fired pizza joint; fresh ingredients, thin crust, good crunch. I would be interested in trying the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service: 1/5 Food: FIVE OUT OF FIVE   Before we get started on why we came (the food!) I have to make a note about the service. We brought my boyfriend's parents and their friends from out of the country to make a party of 6 out on the patio. Our waitress was short and abrupt. Normally I'm ok with that but we felt like we were being given a cold shoulder. Next the food runner was so incredibly rude that we considered walking out. Her hands were full with plates, and she barked what she was holding to each of us (hoping we told her what went where I suppose? Perhaps a nicer tone next time). When we told her nobody ordered 2 of the items she'd brought over she kept repeating, \"well my hands are full.\" Umm yes, we know, of the wrong food... Finally 20 minutes into our meal, the hostess brought the missing salad we were waiting on. Finally, our waitress brought the check but never came back to collect the bill. Again, we almost just walked out.  Now, despite the terrible service, our food was delicious. The kitchen has it going on. For a chain restaurant I wasn't expecting such a quality salad. I had the Pear, Gorgonzola, and Arugula Salad and added roasted chicken to it. The whole thing tasted amazing and didn't give me the guilties. Everyone who ordered pizzas loved the thin crust and the flavor of the wood grilled pizza dough.  I would consider Brixx for take out next time!"}
{"text":"This is our first time coming to Brixx and we really enjoyed it. We ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola and the Bronx Bomber. The  Pear and Gorgonzola was unique. The Bronz Bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients. Personally I would have like them to be a little more crispy. But, that's just a personal preference.   What I really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables! Great customer service and great food"}
{"text":"Boy was I disappointed.  I've looked forward to visiting Brixx since moving to the area, but I never plan to go back.  The guy at the bar wasn't friendly, basically ignored me while talking to a fellow who appeared to be a regular, then rushed me out the door. For a Friday night, the place was practically empty. My pIzza was soggy and chewy because it was undercooked. There were hardly any toppings, so I don't understand why it costs $11. I've gotten great brick oven pizza before and this doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"These folks have come a long way.  They have a fantastic staff and some of the best food around.  What I really love is their bar.  Seriously, great selection and even better services.  Kudos to Mike and the team.  Love the food and service.  Can't get much better than this."}
{"text":"I came on a Monday night and got both of their specials that night- the taco pizza and a draft beer for $2.00 pint night. Our server was super friendly and the pizza was great. I completed the survey on the receipt and got an email back with a free appetizer. The next day I also got an email from the general manager personally thanking me for completing the survey. I am very impressed with their awesome customer service! I will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick bite during or after work in uptown. I been here quite a few times and just recently we were here for a quick meeting after work with our boss since she was in town from CA. They have good choices for wine, beer and great vegetarian food. This would be a perfect spot for happy hour or if you want to get some wine and seat outside to enjoy the outdoor. I will be going back here again for sure."}
{"text":"THEM DUDES AIN'T FOOLIN'  By far the best \"unconventional\" pizza I have ever had. Adding pimento cheese felt like a risk, but instead turned out to be more of an adventure. I was surprised at the amazing taste and the crunch in that pizza (The one with four Italian meats). Now I'm not saying it beats or even comes close to my New York pizza, but for pizza out in the these parts, it was an incredibly nice surprise.   Although I only go to Charlotte once or twice a month, which limits the amount of times I would visit the same restaurant more than once, this is one place I would not mind going to again... And it's a chain.   Also, I might add, Jeff, the waiter who served my friends and me, was one of the most accurate people in the restaurant business. I don't say that lightly. Never has a waiter or waitress's told me what to expect with such accuracy. What he said I would get was exactly what I got. That to me, means a lot. Kudos to Jeff! The manager was very nice, too.   Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, the artichoke dip is an appetizer you cannot go wrong with."}
{"text":"One word: BASIC. Had dinner for first time tonight. Pizza was basic.  App was basic (Pimento Cheese and pita) and salad was basic (forgot the chicken on it). Waiter was a drip; however manager stopped by to check on folks. App came out with our dinner (too late). Beer took 15 to make to the table. brixx was worth try but gave us no reason to come back.  the box."}
{"text":"Delicious   Different fresh ingredients   95% of SC shutdown because of snow, this gem was one of the very few restaurants open and I must say very impressed we had jerk chicken and meatball pizza!  Would get again"}
{"text":"WOW, I was impressed. The calzone and the 4x4 were Delicious!! (No, I didn't eat both myself lol just nibbled one and half of the other. I totally wanted to though Nom Nom)  The food came out hot and there was virtually no wait for the food or a table. It was a little busy but I think we hit them at the best time, between high traffic spurts. Beer selection wasn't too bad either The service staff have great attitudes and the place was clean (That is just my thing....If I go in and the table is sticky after you just wiped it down we are walking out) I loved the decor and the smell when you walk in was lovely. I have added this to my fav cheat meal spots. Great job Brixx!!"}
{"text":"I can't even deny it. I love this place. I've ordered salads, pizzas, pastas and the s'mores desert and have always been satisfied. (Yes, I've been there that many times in the past few months! lol)  And I have to mention that their later kitchen hours works so well with my schedule. It's a great option when you're getting home late and not wanting to cook. Their kitchen serves until 1AM!  The Greek pizza with chicken is awesome! Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite place! He loves the buffalo chicken pizza and I love the cheese pizza. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I like to hang out outside in the sun with a cold brew and a slice of pizza stacked with cheese.  I thought that this place was a little overhyped at first, but it lived up to its supposed greatness.  The waiter was fresh and quick, I actually slipped him a really good tip just because he was so pronto.  It is also fun to sit inside and check out the cooks making the pizza, you can check out the whole process.  The crust here is crunchy and just right.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Our waitress forgot to put in our order.  We waited for an hour after we only received a dry hummus appetizer.  After we inquired about where our pizzas were our waitress disappeared for five minutes, came back and told us our ticket had been 'lost', didn't apologize, and said the kitchen was making our food really fast.  We said never mind, we had 6 year olds that needed to get to bed, she brought our check (seriously?  You wasted our time, we had to leave hungry!) We paid and left.  It wasn't busy when we got there, our menus weren't taken after we ordered, drinks not refilled.  All in all I'm leaving hangry."}
{"text":"I go to Brixx often as I work in Dilowrth! I made a to go order today for the office and when we got back to the office, realized we were a pizza short. I called the restaurant and it was prepared quickly and we were also given a complementary coupon for one free pizza. So nice! Thanks again. We will def. return! Actions mean a lot!"}
{"text":"We spent the morning in uptown today, taking our kids to Discovery Place Science. We chose this eatery as a second choice after our first choice (Queen City Q) was seen to be overrun with drunken St. Patty's Day revelers. (The parade was a day late). Brixx was not overcrowded, and thus a winner in that regard.   I'll examine the good first. We were seated quickly, and our drink order was also taken fairly quickly. The food was really good as well; there's something about wood-fired pizza that is beyond compare to other pizzas. And with a coupon from their mobile app, the food was reasonably priced.   Now, the term \"starter\" is defined as a small course eaten before the main course. So when I ordered their Brixx Stixx as a starter, I kind of expected it before the pizzas. Maybe that was my mistake, expecting an appetizer before the main course; silly me. And 25 minutes isn't too long to wait for the main course, unless, of course, you're hungry and want a \"starter\" first.   Our server was obviously busy, so it's likely for this reason that she forgot our request for lemons for our water. It's OK, we re-requested them 20 minutes later from someone else and got them.   But is her busyness to blame for not asking - even once - how the food is, or if we need anything else after it was served? She didn't speak to us again until dropping the check off. I don't think that a $3 tip (a little over 10% of the pre-discounted check price) was out of line here.    Overall: good food, meh service, probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Average pizza at best and sub-par appetizers. Decent beer specials are only upside. Walk across the street and eat at Fuel for some real pizza."}
{"text":"Where else can I get a pear and gorgonzola cheese pizza?  I know it's probably not the first thing that comes to mind when you want to grub on pizza but I like a refreshing take on an old classic like that and Brixx does a wonderful job on it.  One thing I like about Brixx is I never feel weighed down by their pizzas, I suppose that is due to the fresh ingredients and the thin bake style they use.  Good service, good pizza.....no worries here!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Brixx!  Dropped in here for dinner last night and for the first time I actually tried their wood fired chicken salad.  It was perfect! Balsamic dressing, chestnuts, and great grilled chicken really stood out along with the goat cheese.  They serve the salads in chilled bowls and that's my favorite presentation for a salad.  The contrast of the cool greens with the warm chicken was superb.  Service was great and we had several visits to our table to see how things were going.  Another great little surprise wall Bell's Two Hearted on draught here! SCORE!"}
{"text":"The salads at Brixx are simply shrinking. Lettuce was brown, barely any feta. With the way overdone salmon was around 14.00. Rip off. The chicken florentine had barely any chicken or spinach on it. Sad to say, I've always loved this place. Will never return."}
{"text":"I try to support local business as often as possible. Brixx is the only chain restaurant I visit. It's due to $1.95 craft beer on Mondays and consistent pizza. We are beer snobs, living in a town of Bub drinking rednecks. Brixx has a fair choice of craft beer and not a Bud tap anywhere in sight.   Only one very small blot about Brixx on Cox, trivia game is way too loud."}
{"text":"Brixx has great staff. Husband says pizza is super good. Salads are amazing.  My children and I have to eat gluten free. GF pizza is meh. Toppings taste good crust is soft and a little doughy. But, this is not unique to this restaurant in Charlotte. We find this to be true all over the Charlotte area. Which is why I gave it a five star."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, excellent customer service and great menu. Dining outside on the deck is a must. Highly recommend the BBQ Chicken pizza."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to meet a girlfriend up for lunch and was amazed by their drink specials they have.  $2 draft beers on Monday and for the incredible selection of draft beers, I made a mental note to come back on a Monday night with the boyfriend!  The service was good, the place-clean and simple.  They had a nice sized patio, too, which I can imagine would be perfect for warm summer nights.  I ordered the chicken florentine pizza and devoured the entire thing....so tasty!  The crust was thin and cripsy and the ingredients were fresh and plentiful.  The second time I went in the evening with friends and I tried their greek salad (yummy but a little heavy on the red peppers) and their americano pizza....DELICIOUS!  It's not my usual NYC-style pizza that I'm usually about, but I will be back.  You just can't beat a personal sized pizza.  :)"}
{"text":"Great woodfired pizza that is light and not too filling."}
{"text":"I called one night for a take-out order, and the person on the phone informed me that after 10, they have 2 for 1 pizzas. I paused for a moment, wondering if I heard correctly, then for some reason said \"No, thank you.\" I don't know why, either, I was confused! I have since filed it away in my brain, and have taken advantage of this many times.  The pizza is always good, cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients. My favorites are the Rustica or the Artichoke. I am also a fan of their sandwiches. Whenever I've gone in to get my pizza, it's always full of fellow pizza fans.  Look, some have said that it's not the best pizza, and maybe if you're expecting a typical American-style pizza you might find at Fuel or Hawthorne's, it's not as big or as greasy. But if you think of it more of a flatbread, or perhaps deliciousness in a box that they give you 2 of for no reason at all, it is perfect for me.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because of the teeny parking lot. It's not their fault, and I don't really know where they would expand, but it sure is awkward to get in and out, especially if it's full."}
{"text":"Brixx was our first place that we visited for lunch when on a recent trip to North Carolina. The prices are good especially for the amount of food you get. The service was excellent and I really enjoyed the beer sampler as well! The server recommended different beers from the area and even though he wasn't very knowledgeable on where each one was from, it was good enough to pick a good selection.  I got the caprese sandwich and it was tasty and filling. It was a great first stop on our trip."}
{"text":"I love the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza, Thai chicken pizza and Buffalo chicken pizza.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I came on a Friday late afternoon and it was nearly empty. Shocking an empty place on a Friday. I sat at the bar. I wasn't greeted despite no one being there. There is tons of parking in the lot for this place but only appears some of the shops are more popular. The bar tender made recommendations on food and I stuck with the basics after he made my makers mojito and attempted to top it with half soda. Ummm it doesn't mention soda in the recipe on the menu. And why is half the drink soda. This is why I like to sit at the bar and watch my drink be made (check my photo). I totally called him out on this soda thing.  So he put it in a smaller glass. So I had the tiniest mojito in the world and you think I trust your recommendations on food?! Nope I'm sticking to the basics to see if you can accomplish a good basic pizza. So had the americo. Very doughy crust. Not okay that I had to ask for water or napkins. Will I return? Maybe if I am desperate. Customer service, food, and drinks need some support. Good luck Brixx and hope your experience is better then mine if you choose to embark on that journey."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Be sure and ask about their lunch special of salad and a small pizza for $5.50. It's an awesome deal and it is not advertised on the menu. It is great food and great service at a great price."}
{"text":"Place was busy, we sat at the bar.  Great pizza, and great service from bartender 'Jake'!"}
{"text":"This is still my goto choice for gluten free pizza. The have gluten free beer as well. The appetizer selections that are gluten free are pretty limited. They have no gluten free desserts at all. But the pizza selection is fabulous. My top three are the rustica, the greek, and the chicken and mushroom. If you com at 10:00 or later on Sunday through Thursday the pizza is 2 for 1. My wife likes the sandwiches and salads. Kids are welcome but there is no mac and cheese. Nor are there any burgers available. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have never written a review ever, but I feel I must stop others from wasting their time and money stopping here. Service slow, expensive, and we watched 3 tables of people that came in after us get their food and when I asked my the manager about this he said he would check into it and NEVER came over to talk to us! Very disappointing all the way around.....go some place they appreciate your business!!"}
{"text":"It was so wonderful place for me to hang with my best friends and they can understand my language due I am deaf! Foods was so deliciously!!"}
{"text":"Average pizza and the interior was a bit on the dirty side for my liking"}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I came here last night around 11 to get the buy one pizza get one free deal. Our waitress greeted us and brought our drinks, yet she continued to complain about how crazy and busy it was in the store almost every time she came back to us. She also let us know that things were going to be a slow process (not sure why you would promise a bad experience to your table). When I ordered, I only wanted a dessert and asked her what the seasonal dessert was (because that was an option on the menu) and in a frustrated and aggravated tone, told me she didn't know and then told me I could only pick from the rest of the desserts listed on the menu. Overall, she had an attitude that made me and my friends feel like a burden and a problem for her."}
{"text":"First time here. Took me a while to find parking so right out of the gate, I was behind the ball. When we sat down, the guy seemed good and attentive. That was wrong. I ordered specifically because I do NOT like onions. So I said, no onions. Guess what? My sandwich arrived with onions. I was not in the mood to give feedback since I was out with family and wanted to stay cool. I put them to the side of the plate in the hope that he would realize and at minimum APOLOGIZE for screwing up my order. Guess what? That didn't happen, he acted like it was all good. It is not and unfortunately, I will now tip accordingly. Oh and to add to my experience, I ordered a glass of water when the food arrived (from another server) and never got it. Same deal, the guy forgot or whatever but that's just bad. Now my bill is here at was it worth the money? Definitely no. So he can hate me if he wants but I tip based on service and their service was poor at best. The food would've been better if the right ingredients would've been used. Long story short, probably will not be coming here anytime soon and if I do, will call the manager if they sit me with them again."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place I have ever been to . The bad thing is that they don't have a lot of vegan options but this place is still a great place to go to . My daughter loves this place as well."}
{"text":"Always loved the food, and service. I will return usually during Hornets basketball season   My only complaint was the Shot glass had lipstick from the last guest!"}
{"text":"Good, reliable food in the heart of Birkdale. Their menu features pizzas, salads, pasta, and sandwiches/wraps. I like their veggie pizza w/ vegan cheese and I'm a fan of their pasta pomodora. The kids meals include a drink and they can chose from pasta or pizza. They normally offer coupons on their website for buy two get two free on Tuesdays. There is patio seating year round (heated/covered in the winter) & their staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Aside from making a great Pizza Margherita (the sweett basil, fresh cheese, OH MY!), they have one of my favorite salads, The Brixx Salad. Mixed greens, smooth, creamy goat cheese, perfectly flavored & grilled chicken, toasted pine nuts and a fabulous balsamic vinaigrette. I had quite the love affair w/this dressing during my first pregnancy and our wonderful server once sent home an entire container free of charge. Bless her. The service is usually very good but be prepared for a lengthy wait on the weekend. Nice, shady patio for people watching on a leisurely afternoon."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this Brixx location was fantastic!  Although parking can be difficult, once you are inside you forget about any parking hassles.  The restaurant is very clean and well-organized.  One of the best design features is chalkboard paint on the walls. My kids (ages 2 and 5) loved this and it kept them entertained.  The staff was very friendly, and was very accommodating to the dairy and gluten allergies at our table.  Our food was delicious, and the amount of options for people with severe food allergies is second to none.  We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"OK, so I tried this location after hating all the experiences I've had at the Blakeney location and it was better than a 1 star, but far from a 5 star.  They offer BOGO on apps and pizzas after 10, woo hoo! Thankfully they're open till 1am too, which is why we ended up there (Charlotte, you need more late night spots!). Tried the spinach and artichoke dip with pita wedges and it was awesome. Also ordered the brushetta and it was ok, but Mellow Mushroom's is much better.  For pizzas, we tried the mushroom and pear/gorgonzola/walnut. Both were lacking in any sort of taste. Sadly, I had to douse my pizza in balsalmic (I love it and it saves everything in my book), and while it was BOGO I regretted it.  Next time, I'll go back for the apps since I know the hummus is good, as is the spin/art dip but only because they're one of the only places open late.  PS: Why no Olde Mecklenburg on tap here? It's on at all the other locations...?"}
{"text":"Brixx is a wanna-be beer bar serving boring food. I went a few times and tried a few things, all of which are forgettable except for the creamy balsamic dressing (excellent) and the $1.95 domestic drafts every Monday night. Even with the special, it's hard to choose a beer that isn't boring - they go through their beer so slowly, you can tell that they don't clean their beer lines and the lineup rarely changes. I've tried the mexican pizza (B-), the mushroom wrap (C), and the buffalo chicken pizza (D-, and double negative for getting my order of no gorgonzola wrong not once but twice)  The portions are ok, the service is hit and miss, the patio seating outside is nice - basically, I'd spend my money at a million other places before wasting it here."}
{"text":"Brixx, it's time I came clean. I'm using you. You're just somewhere I go when I'm desperate and it's late at night. Your BOGO pizza and apps are a good deal, and let's face it - you're close to me. But I just want you to know that when Charlotte has more places open late Mon-Thur, I WILL start going to those places and I will not miss you. So let's just keep our thing at what it is right now, but please don't leave your menu on my take out box again, OK?"}
{"text":"Walk in no one even speaks walked up to counter waiter waitress walk off... someone behind me and my 4 year walks in greeted and tookin care of.... am i the wrong color for respect i wonder"}
{"text":"Not my favorite at all not horrible but not worthy of a second visit I'm thinking!  Prices are good but food was mediocre.   Nice patio seating and Birkdale is very nice so the atmosphere was pleasant.    I ordered the pear  and Gorgonzola with onions and olive oil based with thin crust.   Bland is all I can say.     Hubster had the wild veggie pizza and added  shrimp that was supposed to be blackened but wasn't.    We also had the trio hummus plate which was palatable except for the wimpy celery.    If I go back I would go the salad direction for sure!    If you check in you get a free appetizer!!!!"}
{"text":"Our server Matt was great! Gave great recommendations & had a great personality! As for food, we were all impressed! Great vegan options & vegan cheese is offered at no up-charge! Yay!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Savannah,  GA. 6 months later and I realize it's too long to go without my Brixx fix. Chicken Florentine pizza or mozzarella sandwich where are you???!!!!  I eat the chicken penne with gorgon zola sauce in my dreams. Please please please come to Savannah!"}

{"text":"I always sit at the bar........watch the crew work and create pizza's while a TV show silent ESPN footage.  I alway order the same thing........Americo and 2 beers..........and there is something to be written about consistency.....it is a good thing.  No one.........in my  mind makes a better pizza."}
{"text":"So, I found out that since I have changed up my pizza...mixing in a mushroom only half with the other side being the Americo I am being up charged $2 making my pizza which is normally $9 to $12?????  What?  Needless to say I am struggling to find the logic on how a $9 pizza and a $10 pizza makes a $12 pizza.  I feel like I was ripped off.................so perhaps I'll just stick to one pizza or the other rather than have them \"stick it to me\" with this up charge??"}
{"text":"My go to place for P I Z Z A.....Americano or nothing for me......though their Margarita pizza is also really good, it is a place that is always busy (great people watching in the Birk) and fun for the one that is a creature of habit."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza and more place.  Family atmosphere early, sports on TV, great selection of beer on tap and specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"In need of lunch and craving pizza, I stumbled into Brixx on a bustling Sunday afternoon.  I chose to take advantage of the outdoor seating to try and soak up the last rays of sunshine that I was likely to see for 8 months and mostly was successful, although the clouds kept me guessing.  A quick review of the menu and I settled on the pear, walnut, and gorgonzola pizza, washed down with Diet Coke.  The pizza was pretty good - I especially enjoyed the crust, although the pears seemed slightly underdone.  The pizzas are a large personal size and it was a struggle but I did manage to finish mine off.  Service was on top of things, my soda was refilled at proper intervals, and I left with my cravings satisfied and my stomach full.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pizza and beer is one of the great food combinations of all time and that's why you stop in here.  My always amazing Yelp Mobile App zeroed me in on these folks.  Thanks Charlotte Yelpers!  So I walked in the door and scanned the modern décor.  I don't mind modern décor when it matches the food but to me, pizza and beer is a rustic kind of meal.  I know it's a personal preference but I would have liked a different atmosphere.  Next came the beer list and the one word I would use to describe it is decent.  There was something for everybody here but nothing really exotic to excite the true beer aficionado. You can expect almost thirty drafts.   I was mildly annoyed that their list does not include ABVs.  They should add this sooner rather than later as it's become standard at good craft beer joints.  Next I perused the pizza menu and choose the BRONX BOMBER for $10.95. It included spicy Italian sausage, prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, tomato sauce and fresh oregano.  I ordered it because the carnivore in me was roaring and this is as close as I could get to a meat lovers pie.  They should consider adding one to the menu.  It was out quickly and I have to say I was impressed.  The amount of toppings was appropriate.  It was not greasy and that's a very good thing. For me, one thing that's true of a great pizza is that you can taste both the crust and the toppings.  That was true here and the delicious taste of a little char on the crust came through.  The size of the pie is worth noting.  It will definitely fill up one person but is probably a little small for two. Overall this was a very good pie.  Throughout my meal customer service was just fine.  These folks get a solid three stars from me and if I could I would go for three and a half."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for a relatively quick meal. The buffalo chicken pizza was okay, but the chicken thai pizza was great! The breadsticks were tasty also. Service was a little slow but it was during the lunch rush so it was understandable. Overall a good place to stop in for some pizza or subs!"}
{"text":"Average menu. Not much to say. Heard the drinks are worth the price though. May need to check that out at a later date."}
{"text":"I've been to Brixx a couple times but didn't realize they had vegan options, and I didn't know their doughs were vegan. I ordered the vegetable pizza with the vegan cheese and it was good. Crust was light and crispy and the veggies weren't overdone.   It's a nice atmosphere; casual like you'd think a pizza place would be. I'll return."}
{"text":"This place holds a pretty nice memory for me--I had my first-ever date here about 13 years ago.  I went here with a bunch of friends because we needed some hefty food to soak up the copious amounts of alcohol we had consumed hours before.  The pizza at Brixx is declicious--love the thin crust, the toppings are standard but they do a nice pie so I can't complain.  Katie, our server, was phenomenal, so ask for Katie (cute lady with short hair).  If you read this, THANKS KATIE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new take on an old classic. All fresh ingredients and smells that are wonderful. I personally did a pasta dish, angel hair with marinara and meatballs and melted Romano cheese, that was wonderful. The others in my group did various forms of pizza, the 4 x 4 seemed popular, and these looked fabulous also!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined here more than six times. On each occasion I was very pleased. The servers were very responsive. On my last visit they were too responsive. Two different servers brought my beer. They left the extra beer, with no extra charge.  I have enjoyed every pizza, save one. I found the chicken florentine pizza bland. Order that one for your picky eater child. My favorite is jerk chicken. When I suggested that their beer offerings did not include enough dark beers, their manager asked for a recommendation and within the month they had it on tap (Founders Porter). Their Left Hand Stout is also excellent. A local micro brew also supplies great offerings.  Champaign has some great pizza offerings. Brixx thin crust brick oven pizza is unique. Few restaurants offer this kind of variety in toppings. And if there is one they haven't thought of, speak up. They listen to suggestions."}
{"text":"Love the half price wine night! Goes well with the BBQ chicken pizza."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was amazing!!! Drinks were average, wait staff and bartenders were friendly. I had the Bronx bomber and it was pretty good. In comparison to other wood fired pizza places, this is not my favorite. Although I liked it enough to go back. They make their own sweet and sour mix for drinks and it was pretty great!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good here but also, they have an amazing pasta dish (roasted chicken penne with gorgonzola cream sauce). Very large beer selection. This location is good for families. Great service."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night extremely busy. Sat at the bar with no wait. Bartender was overwhelmed but handled it great! Beers were great. I had a small spinach side salad which was okay probably would pass on that next time. Had the Hawaiian pizza w. Chicken and pineapple which was good & my husband had meatball & pepperoni. Both were good but we weren't amazed by the pizza it's been hard to come by good pizza as we are from NY. Will go back though friendly service and cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Not like the pizza we are used to from NY but it's not bad. It's always consistent which is a plus and prices are decent. Pizza isn't very Filling.  I do Like the Mexican pizza, it's sauce is a refried bean sauce. Reminds me of the Mexican pizza from High School!  The Thai chicken salad is always one of my favorites. Be careful this location gets packed fast especially in the winter when the patio isn't utilized as much. Good specials on drafts and usually find a coupon that makes it a better deal. Service is always consistent and friendly."}
{"text":"Just an fyi to those in the Chambanavoy area - Brixx gives our awesome coupons. We had a buy one pizza get one free, they even let us do a half and half with the specialty pizzas at no extra charge. Food was great and so was the service! One of my favorite new places in Savoy!"}
{"text":"Pizza, drinks & service was great!  Hummus was awesome, great selection for pizza-- recommend adding balsamic to pear Gorgonzola!  My friend thought she lost an earring & manager called back after searching & was super nice!  Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Brixx is incredibly popular, which I found somewhat surprising since the place doesn't really blow me away. The Dilworth location is especially popular; it's jammed on weekends. I love the patio here--great for beers. Lots of people hang at the bar here, although you can definitely do better. The bar doesn't really offer much as far as I can tell: it's decent--a couple of tv's, some chairs.   Great beer selection, lots on draft, which is great. As for the food, it's just ok. If you're gonna get a pizza (and you should), try the Spicy Shrimp. I really like it. Someone in my group got a veggie and vegan pizza (vegan cheese etc), and it didn't seem all that appetizing. Another friend swears by the penne with vodka sauce; I tried it and it was decent. The salads are pretty good (and cheap) and the bread they're served with are really tasty.   Again, though, this place is packed, so some people LOVE it. It's fine, but it certainly didnt dazzle."}
{"text":"Brixx Pizza franchise is known for their excellent pizza and wide ranging beer selections. This franchise in Gastonia is exceptional, with friendly service and consistent food. I love their Chicken Penne and bbq pizza. A \"must go\" restaurant in my opinion"}
{"text":"The food here is just average but a few things are working in their favor...  A. Good beer selection and even better specials. ($3.50 Charlotte beers on Tuesdays!)  B. Family friendly inside, pet friendly at outside seating.  C. Coupons and specials galore! When we went, we had a free appetizer thanks to the Yelp check-in and a buy 2, get 2 entrees free coupon from their website. Our check for 3 adults and 1 kid should have been over $70. Instead, we walked out for $30.   I had the butternut squash pizza and was not a fan -- the sweet squash was an odd match with the sharp goat cheese. I think I'll stick with the safer options (roasted veggie or mushroom for instance) from here on out."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I've been here twice and just don't understand the raving reviews. Both times the staff was super slow, the place was packed and there were several employees just standing around the hostess desk. And the food...nothing to write home about. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was nasty. The crust was on the thin side but really soggy. It was almost like it had been undercooked or something. Won't be back for a third time. My husband had a sub and the bun it came on was super cheap white bread and the bread totally overpowered it. The massive, melted piece of cheese wrapped around the sub reminded me or something bachelor would make for himself not knowing how to actually make a good meatball sub. No thanks."}
{"text":"2nd time here. I think we can mark it off the list. Host and Mgr were nice. The rest of the experience including food was not. GF crust was not good.  I know what you're thinking...WHY? BUt we have to do one for one of our kids. We've had a lot of gf and there is much better out other places including frozen. Chicken on pizza was dry. Service...meh. Atmosphere feels like a hotel . Holding out for Papa Dels and we'll bring our own gf pizza."}
{"text":"Food - two stars. Brixx has okay pizza, but I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Portions of appetizers are usually too big/calorie-laden for me and my party. Seems more catered to the obesity epidemic.  Beer - four stars. Excellent and diverse selection of local craft beers on tap. And - oh muh guh! - they have an awesome late night happy hour!  Service - five stars. This is really the only reason for this review. Because of the late night happy hour and the fact that my friends and I usually get off work around 10 at night, we find ourselves at Brixx fairly frequently. The staff at this particular Brixx is SO accommodating and nice. They are always happy to throw a few tables together, provide prompt service, and give us separate checks - no hesitation or questions asked. These guys really deserve a freakin' medal for their awesomeness.  So, if you want a great late night happy hour, good beer or (for some reason) crave mediocre pizza with some of the best servers in town, come check out this Brixx."}
{"text":"First time trying Brixx. It's a sit down restaurant similar to Mellow Mushroom and California Pizza kitchen. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk pizza and my friend got the Rustica. I was expecting the Carribbean Jerk to be similar to the one at CPK or similar to the Maui Wowie at Mellow Mushroom. It's not very good compared to either of those places, but the crust on the pizza was good. Overall taste was not great. My friend said there was chunks of garlic in his and it would've been better if it was pressed garlic. Service was quick and the waiter was very tentative. Although we were the only ones in there at the time so I guess that should be expected. We had a buy one get one free deal, so value wise it was definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"It is decent pizza, Better than a Dominos or a Papa Johns but nothing I would rave about. I  have visited this establishment 3 times now and I am not impressed with its staff.  We made our 3rd attempt on New Years Eve.  We arrived around 6pm and we were seated right away. That is the first time we did not have to wait for a table so life was good! I would like to tell you  it was a nice enjoyable relaxing dinner but from the time we were seated to the time we finished it was a total of 25 minutes. Now that would be great if it were my lunch hour but it was dinner and we went out for a reason to have some fun and enjoy food. We barely got seated and started to look at the menu and the waitress came up and asked if we were ready. well no so we ordered drinks and asked her to come back. Just a few (very Few) minutes later she came and we ordered. She rushed us that we even felt that we had to blurt our order out so fast that if we wanted to ask a question we could not. the next thing we know the Pizza came. It was room temperature. and not cooked they way I asked, but the waitress was long gone that we could not even tell her. Oh she did pop by to drop the check. I finally had to grab her to get a refill of drinks. It is one thing if the food was good but for Room Temperature Pizza and an attitude get em in and out quick is not the place for me."}
{"text":"Easily the best service we have had since moving back to Gastonia. Went fairly late on Tuesday. But one get one special plus $3 draft special was great!! But the service was fantastic! As someone in the service industry I just wanna say thanks!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this Brixx location and the Brixx franchise for several years now.  The food is always good and the service is always solid.  I think what I appreciate most about Brixx is the effort they put into having a large, diverse beer selection.  I completed their MBA program last year and enjoyed everything about it, from the beer dinners to the free schwag to just trying so many new beers.  I've probably tried 1/2 of the pizzas they offer and have enjoyed each one.  The Bronx Bomber is excellent, as is the veggie and Mexican.  They also have sandwiches and wraps that are really good as well.  If you want a delicious sandwich, ask for \"the Chad.\"  The waitress will look at you like she's confused and has never heard of this menu item.  This is normal, because it's not a real thing.  but I always order a Roasted Chicken Club on toasted flatbread (instead of focaccia as it comes) with a side of Caesar dressing.  Get extra napkins for your friends so they can clean up after your face explodes with the first bite of this awesomeness."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was in this Brixx.  Even though I can walk to this place, I think I avoid it because it is so small.    But I stopped here for a late lunch this week and came out with a great impression.  First off, although the place is small, they make use of every inch of space.   There are booths around the perimeter and tables placed close in the center of the restaurant.  Outside is a covered patio which looks like the place to sit when the weather is warmer.  There's also a few seats at the bar and that's where I sat.  Behind the bar is about 12 beer taps, a full bar and wine bottles racked on the wall and below.  To the left of the bar starts the kitchen...a stove, and a salad, fresh prep area.    I ordered a chicken florentine wrap but what I actually got was a Chicken club.  No worries because that chicken sandwich was wonderful.  The foccoccia bread alone was fresh and flavorful that made me want more.    Service at a bar is usually spot and and that was the same here.  And contrary to sitting at the bar, all I ordered was an unsweet tea.  :)  As for the parking lot that someone else mentioned, yes it is small but there's overflow parking in the next lot with a stairs up to Brixx."}
{"text":"I first went here with some buddies of mine a few months back. My first impression walking in was reluctance. There were what seemed like a million little leaguers running around screaming and a hostess who continually forgot the name of our party of 4 people.   But things got better. We were seated outside, which is surprisingly quieter than the dining room that night. We ordered a couple of pizzas to share and they were delicious. It was a group of fellas so needless to say the pizzas that we ordered were the ones covered in different meats. But they were really tasty and well-prepared. They also had some good beer options, which perfectly complimented the pizza.   The other few times I've been there I've sat outside. Why mess with a good thing, right? Each time the service has been pretty good. No complaints from me.   It's a simple formula really. Good food, good beer, good service and good prices. What's not to like?   I definitely see myself coming back here for more."}
{"text":"While this place is a chain restaurant, it really doesn't feel like it & I'm a fan. This location is located right off East Blvd & is in a nice little cozy location.  The building seems pretty old, which I think is why I don't feel like I'm eating chain here. The kitchen is pretty open here too, so you can see a lot of the pizza making & preparation. The seating area is not too large, but they do have a patio area that's ideal if the weather is nice. The lunch crowds are hectic here so make sure you get here early or late.  While I won't comment too much on the food considering it's a chain, the pizza is worth it. I love how they make their pizzas & they taste great without making you feel like you're eating junk. I absolutely hate the fast food pizza (Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc.), but this pizza is entirely different & much better. You will pay a good price for it, but it's worth it.  Brixx serves some quality pizza that I love & this location is a nice little spot that will make you feel like you're at a mom & pop joint."}
{"text":"The locals love this place. It is one of those places that you JUST KNOW someone will suggest for lunch in either Dilworth or uptown.  It is good- don't get me wrong. I like the pizza with pear on it (trust me). The crust is thin- the way I personally prefer. The salads are fresh. The outdoor area in Dilworth is nice.  It is a bit overpriced though and I will never understand the undying love that the locals have for it (really- there is a huge fan club)"}
{"text":"Not trendy, but solid food, good drinks, reasonable prices.  This is a very chill place to hang out on any evening with a few friends & they are open late which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Brixx has the best pizza around! They have a friendly staff and each location has an awesome beer list. It is the perfect place to go for a fun and relaxing night."}
{"text":"Went here because I've been there in other cities and loved it. Always have good deals on drinks or food. Staff was friendly and food was good. Will be back I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Brixx is... A chain restaurant I have low standards already. I've been meaning to review this place a few Times,  I started out with a 4 star review, and then the last time I went knocked it down it's been a few weeks, but the quality & the bill still haunts me.   We started with some bruschetta... It was uneventful to say the least. The flavors were bland, and lacking.   Hubs ordered a chicken salad before I got there, and it was actually pretty good. Chicken, Goat cheese, some other shit thrown in there...spring mix and spinach is what it looked like seemed fresh and the balsamic dressing was awesome. It was big enough to split too.   He ordered what I think was suppose Margherita, buuuut it failed. Hardly any cheese, the tomatoes looked like shit. How can you have a soggy, and over cooked pizza. HOW?!? It was gross.   Server was overly enthusiastic, but kinda sucked at his job... Can I get a refill boo?!? That's what the cup on the edge of the table, me waving, and me shaking a glass of ice means. I wanted to throw our shitty pizza at him if we are being honest.   Good thing the salad was delicious, I had to eat and run we didn't even take the leftovers.   Brixx you need to train your staff on how to cook a proper pie, and pay attention."}
{"text":"I would actually want to give zero starts. This is a new business already confused about when they close. Went about 10:30 pm, they close at 11pm. This was noted on google maps and also there door. There was like 5 employees all just smoking outside and they said there closed. I said what does that sign say?? They said yeah it's wrong. And we're looking at me like I was the idiot. Retards. The owner won't last to long with employees like this."}
{"text":"I visited this Brixx after the lunch crowd while it was slow, so I expected better service. No bartender was at the bar area when I sat down. A waitress came over behind the bar and didn t say a word. Finally the bartender came between  5-10 minutes later.  I ordered the Americo pizza which came out faster than I expected. The taste of the pizza was good, but I've had better. I will be back again to try other things and see how it goes"}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing pizzas I've ever had. It lacked any taste at all. Will not be coming back.....too bad because I was excited to try it."}
{"text":"Drinks:  Huge draft beer selection, everyone in the group ordered beer sampler (up to 4 beers). Loved it.  Appetizers:  Spinach and Artichoke dip (was good) Wood Fired Pita Chips and Three Dips (was ok) Best of all was the Brixx chips. Purple colored chips tossed with goat cheese and spicy sauce on the side.  Entrees: Jerk chicken pizza Mexican pizza Bronx Bomber pizza Buffalo Chicken Brixx salad  All the pizzas were good but I personally loved Bronx Bomber.  Dessert: Tiramisu: Will be definitely in my favorites dessert ever eaten. Very moist and I still think of it's taste. Perfect size for sharing. I loved it.  Decor: Nothing fancy.  Bottom line: Will go back not for their pizza but for beer, chips and Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Twice in a row this place has gotten my order wrong.  The first time was a vegetable pizza and it arrived dry with no sauce on the pizza.  The second time was a margherita pizza, which was incorrectly made with barbecue sauce. Yuk!  When they brought out the new/corrected one, it had anise leaves mixed in with the basil.  Anise taste like licorice, if you don't know. It wasn't tasty at all and I lost my appetite.  Both times when they screwed up the orders they deducted the price of the pizzas, which I guess is okay but it doesn't make me want to come back there.   Who wants to have to order things twice?   It used to be a decent place, but Brixx must have gone through an ownership change recently.  This particular one was renovated in Winter 2011 and they added a lighted awning to the patio.  The menu has changed, as well.  The pizzas are very dry and apparently, the cooks don't know how to make these new ones because they keep screwing up the orders.  Also, it has a non-functional bike rack along Scott Ave. made of concrete.  There are better pizza places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came in town for a concert and decided to stop here to eat before we headed back home. The late night appetizer and pizza specials were cool but the service could've been a lot better. Our waiter seemed very uninterested in serving us as if he had already clocked out for the night. I'd definitely return to Brixx Pizza. Just maybe not this location."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant for family, co-workers or a cozy place. Delicious pizzas. I enjoyed the supreme with broccoli, onions, mushrooms, tomato sauce and cheese that was hand-crafted perfectly with a thin crust that allowed me to taste every part of my pizza. Though we had a reservation, the friendly staff did not seem stressed over the size of our group, which included at least 100 children and staff members, but we were served promptly. I will visit them again on my next trip to Charlotte N.C."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place!  Love the thin crispy crust. Every pizza I've had was great."}
{"text":"I meet friends here for lunch pretty often.  The pizza and pasta are always great and the servers are usually pretty friendly.  A lot of the time we have a buy one entree get one entree free coupon which makes it a really cheap lunch.  Two entrees and two drinks will run you about $20 or so with tip."}
{"text":"Thoroughly unremarkable pizza but good beer selection earns Brixx an extra star.  My bbq pizza's crust was just kind of dry and tasteless. But I could drink Stone beer among other brews I like so Brixx isn't a lost cause."}
{"text":"As usual a great experience. We had our normal favorite in the wild mushroom pizza and we tried the spicy BLT. That might be my new favorite. You can't really go wrong with any of them. Make sure you order one pizza per person. Sharing one pizza is good if you have 2 kids who are sharing, or your a parakeet. One pizza for one person will fill you up nice."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5. We started with a couple four friends beers. We have had these on a few occasions and really enjoyed them (especially the I-77 IPA) but I think something was wrong with their tap as it tasted almost syrupy- very heavy and just overall not so good.   I had a side Caesar which was just ok. I prefer creamy dressing and this was the vinaigrette type  (my fault- I should have asked). The rosemary focaccia served on the side was incredible though.   I went with the quattro formaggio with mushrooms and prosciutto added. The flavor of the pizza was good - but 1/3 of the pizza was crust and I'm just not a crust gal. If I did this again I would almost certainly not add prosciutto as it was too salty (yes prosciutto is naturally - but it shouldn't have been quite this salty). My boyfriend made the comment that it tasted like country ham, I ended up taking off most of it. He went with the margherita pizza which he absolutely loves, but I thought it was a bit soggy.   While certainly my first choice for pizza, it wasn't awful and I would probably give them another shot possibly for lunch."}
{"text":"Sorry, but there's no reason why 30+ whole, half-cooked cloves of garlic need to be on a personal pizza. So overpowering - you can't taste anything else. I guess it's their strategy, since the crust is flimsy and flavorless. Hostess was nice, but the guy making pizzas was texting, proceeded to make my pizza with the same gloves he touched his phone with, then complained about needing a cigarette. Forget this place and go to Pizza Antica instead."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my kids today.  It was mostly good.  I had the pear salad with added shrimp.  It would have been better if the bread was warm instead of cold from the fridge and no butter/evoo or parm.  Also had the 4 cheese pizza which was good with a very thin crust.  The kids ate cheese pizza but did not like the burnt edges which you have.  The server was ok.  Very busy for lunch.  The kids could make their own breadstick but tried to eat it raw.  Might return if there were others who wanted to go.  Would probably not be my first choice. Since Jay added his comment I will again restate:  Your bread needs to be warm and served with butter or I would prefer evoo/parm.  There are many other fine places to dine in CU where this is a norm."}
{"text":"I come here maybe every three months or so. Love the spinach and artichoke dip. I always get that for starters whenever I go. Afterwards I'll just get the Mediterranean salad. I never add the meat, in my opinion I do not think it's worth it. Also the Bronx bomber is my favorite pizza there. The jerk chicken is also good."}
{"text":"My husband loves Brixx. It's in a great location and we always sit in the bar area. They have great coupons too! Their pizza has always been great. Right amount of toppings and just delicious. I always ask for a side of the pizza sauce to dip my crust in. I've also had their pastas too. They are good, but not great. Stick with the pizza. :)"}
{"text":"The great:  1. The beer. In a growing beer market, Brixx has done a great job of offering locally brewed as well as other crafts to please a serious and/or casual beer drinker. The weekly specials are great too; there seems to be a deal on beer almost daily.   2. Service. Super friendly server named Kris; friendly and knowledgable.   The good:  1. The pizza. I like interesting non-tradtional pizzas, so the menu is up my alley. Ordered the Thai-chicken pizza; while it was tasty, there is no way I could have deciphered that it was Thai- inspired if I didn't know.  2. Pear-arugla salad. Our great server Kris, spilt the salad for us, so that was awesome. The salad was good, but missing pears. They are not in season, makes sense, but then take it off the menu.  3. I arrived before 6pm, so happy hour specials (half-price appetizers) were still going. I felt compelled to capitalize on the deal, but nothing about the apps stood out to me. Ended up ordering the hummus trio. Black bean variety was great, but the traditional and the roasted red pepper, weren't anything special and we barely put a dent in those 2.   Overall, the experience was pleasant. The pizza is not my favorite in town, but its good enough for me to return for the great beer and fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Consistently good! Good service and pleasant atmosphere. My go to late night spot. I got the margarita pizza with pesto sauce. My mother got the americo."}
{"text":"Went here with my sisters while I was visiting Charlotte. One sister got a salad that was a good size while my other sister and I got two individual pizzas to share. We had enough with some leftovers- could have really gotten one and shared. I thought I was more hungry then I really was. We sat outside but got put at a table that was more shade then sun and in october it was chilly in the shade. Overall attentive staff and good food."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to kill a few hours in Uptown, and Brixx fit the bill perfectly. They've got an awesome patio, delicious eats, and friendly service: what more could you need?   I was the only person there for the majority of my stay, but they didn't seem to mind. The patio had plenty of space to spread out (I was toting luggage and a computer) and they checked up on me just the right amount of times. The garlic knots were decent, nothing mindblowing, and the salad I ordered was huge and flavorful.   Brixx isn't doing anything super trendy or memorable, but what they do, they do well."}
{"text":"This review goes as a courtesy to the server who was fired for posting her opinion on facebook.  How dare you violate a person's first amendment rights, especially when she does so on her own intellectual property. Shame on you. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Not very good. Dry, thin crust and a paucity of toppings. Palatable and meeting need for sustenance but not delicious."}
{"text":"Usually love this place, it's our favorite place for pizza and beer after all the normal restaurants close. Unfortunately we've now had two poor experiences in a row at Brixx Gastonia. First, we were in the area after a funeral, and came here at a reasonable hour. They told us they were closing up early due to speculations of snow (it didn't snow FYI), and that we could have a quick drink but the kitchen was closed...alright maybe they're just being SUPER precautious. The second occasion was tonight. My mom and I drove 20 minutes here. We live in Charlotte but prefer having dinner in Gastonia as opposed to uptown Charlotte (there's another Brixx there but it's more hectic than Gastonia). We arrived at 10:30pm to find a closed restaurant. The hours listed online said they were \"now open\" and that they didn't close until midnight. Super annoyed. Guess we're gonna stick to our more reliable Charlotte Brixx from now on."}
{"text":"Mmmm Brixx. A wee bit overpriced? Yes. Great location on East Blvd.? Yes. Tasty, creative pizzas? Yes, indeed.   Brixx is the perfect little lunch spot, IMO. Hubs and I frequent this Dilworth location for a quick tasty lunch on their pretty patio. I'm a fan of their Quattro Fromaggio as well as their Artichoke 'za. The 10\" \"personal\" pizza is plenty for me (for lunch) and I usually take home a few small slices. Granted, this is lunch.   The Quattro is super cheesy, as you expect, and the combination of cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gouda and goat) are delicious topped with sun-dried tomatoes. The Artichoke 'za is a bit more healthy and one I normally choose - marinated artichokes, roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, basil pesto and mozzarella. Yum.   I wouldn't recommend getting wheat crust, as it was a little too dry and cardboard-y to me. The traditional is the way to go, my friends. Also, keep an eye out for restaurant coupons, etc. for Brixx. I've scored a few free appetizers and discounted entrees this way!"}
{"text":"I love Brixx! I lived in Charlotte for 4 years & this is one of the only restaurants that I miss. The Brixx salad is my favorite salad OF ALL TIME. Their pizza is also really tasty. The Americo & Rustica are my favorites. But, I have to say that they would probably get 5 stars from me for their salad alone."}
{"text":"Very clearly a chain with cooks who are not concerned with the quality of the final product. I ordered 2 pizzas and there was sparse toppings, only near the center and pretty undercooked. I doubt I'll be back   The place could be good if there was management oversight.  Be sure to tell your waiter you want it done right and not sketchy"}
{"text":"Was greeted at door by an employee with food in her mouth she was still chewing, sat on patio where no music is played, had the bruschetta good but bread was burnt, had the chicken Alfredo for my meal lacked flavor and sauce.  Server never checked back till after 10 minutes of meal being delivered he also never cleared my table of empty wine glasses.  Was done with meal for 10 min before sever came back to check on me.  Server Adam had no personality and really didn't seem to know what he was doing, never saw a manger either.  Overall ok but with being so slow in the restaurant service and food could have should have been better."}
{"text":"Brixx's is my favorite pizza place in Huntersville. My favorite pizza is the Caribbean Jerk Pizza. It has a caribbean sauce base, with mozzarella and gouda cheese. Topped with jerk chicken, pineapple, red onions & roasted red peppers. Brixx is not a typical NY style pizza or a Chicago style pizza (my fav), but they are different and delicious. The pizzas are thinner, with fresh ingredients and there are a ton of options. Give it a try and get creative with your pizza choice."}
{"text":"This is one of the few decent pizza places in Uptown Charlotte.  I have been here a handful of times with coworkers this past year.  They cook in a wood oven, and it seems to make the pizza taste that much better!  My favorite specialty pizzas are:  - The Bronx Bomber: traditional red tomato base pizza with sausages & prosiutto (This is probably my favorite and will keep getting this one)  - Hawaiian: pizza with pineapples & prosciutto  - 4x4: four cheeses & four meats (very filling if you are hungry)  As for anything else like sandwiches or salads I have not really tired, but if you do decide to come here you have to try the pizza at least once!  On a side note they have a great selection of beers on draft for any beer fanatics.    For all the times I have been here I have not had any trouble with seating or the timeliness/attentiveness of their wait staff.  I will definitely be back here sometime in the near future! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, was very quiet and had all the games on the TV's. I ordered a chicken club and the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer and the draft root beer. There wasn't much of an atmosphere before it was so quiet but everything was good, hot and fresh and the service good. The place was clean and the service was good. No complaints here, I would go back"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Pizza was ok.  I got the gluten free Rosemary mushroom chicken.  The crust was good.  Chicken was dry.  Would go again but try different toppings."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Great original pizza flavors that provide plenty of options for every type of eater! Good selection of beers and mixed drinks. The Lumberjack Lemonade was perfectly refreshing! Our server was very kind and speedy."}
{"text":"I love my pizza and pasta dishes! We have eaten here twice and loved it! We like the atmosphere and the food. It stays open late, which is nice. I would recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza...BAD SERVICE... If You're African American  I have been a fan of Brixx for years and have visited numerous locations and never had bad service until last night.  A friend of mine and I ventured to the uptown location and were treated like second class citizens the entire night.  It wasn't particularly busy due to the inclement weather so I thought it was odd that it took nearly 15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge my presence and take my drink order or bring menus to the table.  She never gave her name or smiled and for the entire meal experience, my date had to keep flagging her down.    She hardly checked on us during the meal (our empty dirty plates smiled at her from the table), my beverage glasses became empty and remained that way until we flagged her down and asked for refills, it was awful.  It was then that I noticed that we were the only patrons of color in the entire restaurant.  I have never had the \"race\" experience in Charlotte, so this was shocking.  I was determined NOT to look at the situation that way, but it was soon VERY evident that our Caucasian counterparts were getting stellar service, and we were not.  This all culminated when she brought us the check (which we had to ask for) that she literally tossed across the table.  I was mortified.  Newsflash:  I am an EXTREMELY successful business woman who worked her way through college as a waitress.  I have left tips that were more than the price of the meal in pizza joints just because the service was amazing and I wanted to help out an up and coming young person.  Casual dining should not equal sub par service, and if you have problem with BLACK people, you should work somewhere else.  This experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I will never visit this place again.  I have made it a point to tell my friends not to go there during the upcoming CIAA weekend.  Boycott!"}
{"text":"Being from NY I had low expectations but was blown away with the food.  I had the Asian pear and arugula side salad and the wild mushroom pizza.  Both were excellent.  They couldn't have been any better.  I will be back for more."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  The fam was in the mood for some brick oven pizza and while I id'd some potential winners downtown, we wanted to stick to somewhere close, so off to the Brixx chain we went.  We had the wild mushroom pizza, jerk chicken and vegetable pizzas, and the fire pita with hummus starter. The pita was pretty good I thought, the hummus forgettable.   The mushroom and jerk chicken pizza were both sans red sauce, and the mushrooms with arugula are always a nice pairing, but I wasn't a fan of the jerk chicken pizza. The veggie pizza was also just pretty average. The dough was  not bad, still a little left to chew on with the thin crust, but I think they overdid it on the cheese, and it wasn't great cheese at that. I was tempted to order the tiramisu simply because they said it was made fresh every day, and I am a fan of home-made tiramisu. Sadly, it scored a huge thumbs down, it had none of the fresh airy just-whipped today texture, it was heavy on the rum, disgustingly heavy on the sugar, and the four of us together could not muster up the wits to eat it all. It was a tiramisu gone wrong, a thick, unappealing glob of sickly sweet cream and to top of, a squirting of what I suspect was hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, and bad chocolate shavings on top. Oh the shame.  So to summarize, I am still on the quest to find decent pizza in Charlotte and I will not be back here to satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"We (party of 4) ordered spinach artichoke dip, spinach salad as starters. Pizzas (4)...a mushroom, a greek, an artichoke & a ham. All the food was very good. The server was friendly. All in all it was a nice dining experience.  ps. We ate outdoors."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite to eat while visiting from out of town. When we first walked in we saw how empty it was and thought it was probably off hour. We ordered our food for take out to bring back to the hotel and ordered a margarita pizza for us  and penne pasta with marinara sauce for my son. But once we tasted the food we were not only disappointed but was also a little disgusted with how bad the food tasted. My son literally spat out the penne pasta and one bite of the margarita pizza we didnt have to courage to take a second bite. The staff was friendly and while it is kid friendly it isnt taste friendly. I think we would have better luck by ordering dominos pizza or even frozen pizza. Save yourself the trip and just order room service if your in town for a visit like us."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to my Brixx Pizza last night, the only other location I had been to is the one on Scott's Ave, late night, and it was delicious (buy one, Get one after 10pm I believe?).  When a friend and I arrived at the Birkdale location last night the restaurant was very busy as it was a beautiful evening and everyone wanted a seat outside.  We brought a dog with us so requested a seat outside, the hostesses of a restaurant are very important as they are the customers first impression,  this hostess was very rude and abrupt - when requesting a table she was clueless, then upon seating us she threw the menus down and immediately walked in the other direction.  Because of this we left to try somewhere with better customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza here, with lots of gluten free options!!! We came here with a friend of ours who is on a very strict gluten free diet. He recommended several items on the menu that were gluten free, and all pizzas can be customized to have gluten free doughs (but as I learned today, that doesn't mean the ingredients are also gluten free so make sure you get what you prefer!)  I got a pizza with half spinach and artichoke (the special of the day, with spinach, artichoke, cheese, slices of tomatoes and grilled chicken) and half pimento cheese (jalapeño pimento cheese, roasted red peppers, bacon and fresh spinach). My boyfriend got the barbecue chicken pizza, and our friend got the spicy blt. All our pizzas were made with gluten free crust and we asked for them to be on the crispier side. All of them came out excellent.   Service was great, atmosphere was cool, cleanliness was on par.  The only down side I can think of is the extra $3 for gluten free dough. The pizzas were about $11 each plus the $3 for the dough, and we each ate all of ours. We were stuffed but not the sick-to-our-stomach stuffed. We could have easily taken half home but we knew we wouldn't remember to eat it.   Would definitely like to come back next time we're in town. So many of the other menu items looked appetizing!"}
{"text":"Brixx is one of the rare places to taste the real italian style pizza. Thin crust, simple ingredients, moderate amount of good cheese.  Nice ambiance and friendly people. They are open till late and they usually have a buy one get one free offer from 10 PM on all pizzas and appetizers.   by the way, I sometimes see Mr. Fox (Charlotte's mayor) eating at Brixx."}
{"text":"Solid pizza, albeit with untraditional combinations and toppings.  Had dinner here with a large group and we ordered a bunch of pies.  Had the hummus appetizer with wood-fired chips and veggies - excellent flavor and light. Then had pies, Margherita came and had only sliced tomatoes, no sauce, was delicious despite!  Also had the rustica (or something similarly named) which had pieces of garlic, ham and artichokes - delicious also!    Lots of local beers on tap too, a major plus in my book."}
{"text":"Not a bad meal here. We started with the bruschetta appetizer, which was delicious but extremely messy. Almost a knife and fork kind of deal. I had the rustica pizza without olives, which was tasty. Pretty generous on the toppings but I do think the mushrooms were underdone and they appeared almost raw to the eye. I also thought the whole cloves of garlic were a little excessive even though I love garlic. The Bronx bomber pizza was pretty good as well and again, generous with toppings. They have a really wide variety of different pizzas so pretty much anyone can find something they like. Aside from the food, our server was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience, don't know if I would make an effort to go back, but it's definitely not a bad choice if you're in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"All of the pizzas here are personal pizzas.  You can catch some good deals here at Brixx.  On Mondays you can enjoy all American craft brews for $1.95.  This is a good deal especially if they have the more expensive craft beers on tap like Stone or Rogue.  Some of the Brixx in town offers half price pizzas and apps after after 10:00 but I am not sure what the half-price status of this one is.  The one on Rea Rd definitely has the half price after 10 deal.    The pizzas are pretty good.  The thing you need to know is you can customize your pizza for no charge.  I like to get the wild mushroom pizza add red sauce, pepperoni, and pineapple; hold the arugula.  I try not to \"over-do\" it because I do not want them to stop not charging for toppings.  The Brixx salad is also a great addition to your meal, a light spring mix with pistachios and goat cheese.  If you decide to get the spinach and artichoke dip, I recommend getting the warm pita triangles instead of the croutons.  They just taste better."}
{"text":"Sad to say, Brixx has failed me for the last time. It was a Sunday afternoon lunch for the family and our waitress was beyond distracted. We ordered an appetizer (that felt like it was prepped the day before). The lettuce was dried out and wilted and serving as a \"garnish\" - the app plate was sitting there and she came back to ask if we wanted our drinks to go (but we hadn't gotten our meals yet)?! Meals came and they were just OK. Nothing to write home about and definitely not worth a $48.00 check. We had a coupon for a free app (thankfully the wilted lettuce wasn't something we had to pay for) - so she took the app off but reminded us (in writing) at least 3x that the original bill was more (maybe so we'd tip appropriately?) - we did, we certainly don't blame her for all that was mediocre at Brixx, but we won't be back. Just easier to find other establishments with fresher stuff and more attentive service. Hope they stay busy on the weekends - it's clearly their bread and butter."}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and was going to dinner with my cousin I haven't seen in over a decade and she decided to bring me to brixx in huntersville.  We wanted to sit outside and we were informed it would be a 15 minute wait and we said that was fine.  We received a text that our table was available so we went in and we're seated outside.  There were about 4 to 5 waitresses that passed our table to check on other tables the 17 minutes we sat there without even being acknowledged.  A woman who ended up being the manager asked us if we knew what we wanted for drinks and about 5 minutes later our waitress brought them out.  She didn't apologize for the wait that we had and just asked if we were ready to order.  I informed her that we had been sitting there for 17 minutes and it was a bit ridicules she hadn't even greeted us or let us know she was busy and would be over, not to mention all of the other servers who saw us sitting there for a long period of time with out being helped(I am myself in the service business and understand it can be busy, at the same time I know how easy it is to tell a table you will be right with them and that you are busy) our waitress said she would \"make it up to us\".  My cousin ordered a pizza which she enjoyed very much and I ordered a salad that had pears that were not fresh, and tough chewy shredded chicken.  I had to ask another server to get my waitress because our waitress hasn't come over to check how our food was.  I asked for a new salad with no chicken unless it was fresh and no pears unless they were fresh, I also asked for it Togo because at this point my cousin had finished her meal.  When my new salad came I asked for the check only to find out both of the salads were on this check.  I almost thought it was a joke and there had to be hidden cameras, the waitress came back and I told her that there shouldn't be two salads on my check.  She went back with a shit attitude and comped one of the salads and gave me a \"goodwill\" discount for the other salad I'm guessing which was a total of 2 dollars.  At this point again I was waiting for a camera crew to come out and tell me I was being punked....I asked a server to send the manager over and she came shortly after that approaching me saying\"you don't want your salad\"?  I told her I most certainly did want my salad but there was no way in hell they could rightfully charge me for it, after getting horrible service and having to send my first salad back I can't really believe they didn't comp the entire bill.  The manager took the bill and comped both salads.  When she brought the bill back she didn't apologize or make eye contact, she just dropped it off and walked away.  So much for southern hospitality...most of the people I have encountered in North Carolina have been nothing but pleasant and very polite but I feel as though these people had several sticks up their asses.  The bill came out the final time and it was 20.30 I literally never leave less than 20% being in the service industry myself but I couldn't leave her a 20% tip for the experience they had given me.  I left her two dollars and a penny upside down for her tip, and it's unfortunate because I will be coming back to the state but not visiting that establishment and giving them my hard earned money.  If someone had a horrible experience at my place of employment management wouldn't let them leave unhappy, it seems as though customer service isn't important to them or they don't care about bad reviews.  End of rant."}
{"text":"My first visit, will be my last... Our pizzas were one click above the frozen kind. Yes, the pizza was cooked in an open brick oven, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it, their dough seems to be pre-made, sprinkled with a very light layer of toppings. (We ordered two different flavor and the were both prepared the same, lightly covered) Maybe we visited during a bad time, but Friday @ 7:45pm seems to be prime pizza eating time to me, and the place was 1/3 occupied, maybe others who have visited found the pizza to be disappointing too! The location of the business is awesome, our server was very friendly, it's just the food wasn't what we expected.  Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Love that each Pizza flavor has its own distinctive flavor. Best pizza in Fort mill. We appreciate having an option that's  not the same old standard pizza."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Brixx. They just built this one about 2 miles from my house so I was excited to give it a try. The restaurant was nice and big with some tvs around but not over the top. We were sitting at our table for a good 5+ minutes waiting to be greeted by our server, which you know can feel like an eternity. There was more on the menu than I expected, however being a \"wood fired pizza\" place I expected a better selection of pizza and even a build your own which we couldn't find. My friend got a pizza, I got the Chicken Alfredo and my daughter got a kids cheese pizza. What disappointed me the most was the lack of flavor on anything, it was all super bland. My friends pizza wasn't too bad but it was only 10\" and $12! He ended up putting salt and red pepper on it for some flavor. They are pretty thin so it didn't even fill him up. The little piece of bread that came with my Chicken Alfredo was burnt and cold and the chicken was way overcooked, it was dry and tough. The alfredo sauce was runny and tasteless and the dish wasn't cheap! My daughter said she liked her pizza but then only ate half of it. The kid's meal was supposed to include a drink but then we were charged for the her soda. I didn't notice until we were walking out the door. We eat out almost every day from fast food to burger joints to the occasional upscale steakhouse and I can honestly say I can't remember a meal I was more disappointed with. When I got to work this morning I mentioned to a couple co-workers and they all said they don't like it an won't go back. i wish I had talked to them first, I could have saved myself $50."}
{"text":"We call this place our second kitchen because we easily eat here 3 times a week.  In fair weather the patio is great and non-smoking.  The pizzas are sized for one and priced right.  The ingredients are always fresh and the food ALWAYS comes out on time.  While we generally favor the pizzas (thin California style) the salads are YUMMY!  I highly recommend adding the seared salmon to any salad.  Kudos to Brixx for continually updating their menu...... Boo for changing the original jerk chicken pizza recipe!  Oh and thumbs UP on the wheat crust!"}
{"text":"Have Gluten-free pizza served and baked on its own tin-I have never gotten sick here-6 yrs.   The Brixx salad is unique with goat cheese, mesclun greens, and pistachios.   Best unsweetened tea-I know sweet tea reigns in Charlotte but they actual use high quality tea so even us unsweetened customers are happy.   Full bar and great variety of IPA's available. Casual atmosphere and decent prices."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We arrived with a hungry child and ordered his food before ordering anything else joking with the waitress that he was really, hungry. When she came back for our drink order , we asked if he could have bread while he waited. We ordered our drinks and food. After a long wait, finally his food came out. No bread yet. Drink orders were messed up. Pizza didn't come out hot. Had to get up to get my own red pepper flakes. They kept making excuses that it was trivia night and they had more people than expected. Really I don't care. Will not return."}
{"text":"Brixx has started to grow on me. They don't just serve standard, tomato sauce pizzas. They have a variety of options that will satisfy just about anyone. They also recently added a few new pizzas to their menu that are tasty and keep me wanting to come back...especially the artichoke red pepper pizza with pesto sauce. Their crust is always good, even on the wheat pizzas. And, the prices are really quite reasonable.  You can most definitely expect a wait for a table (sometimes up to an hour), since they are very popular. The quality and attentiveness of the service does vary significantly by server, however. We had one server that we saw watching a football game when we needed refills. Um, the TVs are for the customers' enjoyment...NOT the servers!   Even so, we enjoy the food enough to want to return."}
{"text":"Came in at 9:05 on Monday 7/31. The sign out front said to see the host for seating and Someone told us sit where ever we would like. I had a server bring us menus and silver and ask how we were and she walked away before we could even respond. We proceeded to wait for 5-7 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement, while watching possibly every server on the shift walking past our table. Needless to say, we left. This was our first and more than likely our last time visiting."}
{"text":"It has been too long since I initially reviewed Brixx at Blakeney.   I go there at least once a month and have come to love this place.  The bartenders, I normally sit at the bar, even if my girlfriend accompanies me (I love that she likes to sit at bar as well sometimes) give great service and I never have to wait long for my food or a beer pour.  Brixx must be a great place to work, because the same two bartenders have worked there for the past 5 years or so.  Great beer selection and they always have a special or two to choose from.  I like thin pizza and crispy crust, which  they do both very well.      Still no wifi but I use their neighbors service and I am good!   Glad this place is close to my home!  PS: I never did collect on that free pizza! :-)!"}
{"text":"Menu cards had food stains and it was disgusting to touch. The plates served were not clean. However, the taste and quality of food was good."}
{"text":"All the times I have gone the service has always been excellent. I've had their sandwiches, pastas and pizzas and all were good. My favorite is the wild mushroom pizza. I like mine with kalamata olives and goat cheese added and they gladly accommodate. I am a beer nerd so a place's beer selection plays a huge roll on whether I go there or not. They have a good draft selection and always have several of my favorite beers on tap. The only reason I do not give them five stars is because they can have better rotational drafts and more porters and stouts in the winter months."}
{"text":"Ehhh maybe it was the fact that I came on a random Monday evening but I wasn't impressed with the service or the food. I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and the chicken was over cooked--it had a burnt taste to it which made it hard to enjoy. Our waiter was nice but would disappear for long periods of time especially considering there were probably 20 people in the restaurant total. I think if I came back I would shoot for an appetizer or a salad."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today the place was loaded with flies. All the tables on the south side of the building get hit with sun so you can't hardly look at the person that is across from you while your eating. The service is extremely slow and uninformed. Example: waitress tells our party of 4 about the lunch specials pick any salad and pizza off the menu and you will get 1/2 of that salad and pizza for 7.95. The bill comes and the waitress says sorry the price is different because you do have to get a specific salad. Then follows that comment up by saying my manager lied to me this morning when he went over the specials. Really!?!? Then the food was just average. Kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening to order carry-out.  I ordered from the bar and it was mildly busy when I arrived.  I placed my order and waited.  Then waited, and waited, and waited.  It became so packed in there that it seemed like there was no room for another soul to walk in.  I mean, crazy!  Everyone was running around and it was nuts.  I must commend the wait staff, I saw a lot of teamwork and people working hard.   It turns out the kitchen printer was backed up and my order for breadsticks did not go through in a timely manner.  A manger came out and gave me some coupons for my wait and to say he was sorry.  He was personable and nice.    The meatball sub was awesome!  It comes with onions and peppers on a special ciabatta bread.  The breadsticks were so good!  I love the honey mustard dipping sauce!  Yum!"}
{"text":"If you ever watch the walking dead you will understand the meaning here. The wait staff and hosts were like walking zombies. After waiting for our table to be cleared (15 minutes) I almost offered to bus the table. Finally, after sitting for 10 minutes with no visit from the staff, we cut our loses. Shame ... we used to frequent but it's off our list."}
{"text":"Gotta love a pizzeria that'll serve everyone from the vegans to the Celiacs, even if them pies come out lukewarm, and even if they're a tad pricey and suffer from Enlarging Crust Syndrome (heretofore referred to as ECS).   The Mushroom I had ze other noche was dusted so liberally with cornmeal that it tasted like Special K.   Which was odd.  But still - totally fills a void and many bellies, this Brixx - tho not mine, when I'm craving the pie."}
{"text":"I completed my fourth visit to Brixx, and I have to say that I could not be happier. By all appearances, they've gotten their early foibles under control.   I have had three different pizzas, the Bronx Bomber, the Chicken Florentine, and the wood roasted tomato. Each of these pizzas has been outstanding. (I added red sauce on the Bomber and the Florentine).  The beer menu was excellent, and the prices have been reasonable and the beer specials (Wednesday, I believe) were outstanding.   The kids menu was very good, and my kiddos just love their pizza and pasta at Brixx. What is more, they will give each kid a ball of dough that they can shape to their pleasing and they will throw it in the oven, and out comes their own creation! Great idea!  I have not found Brixx to be overwhelmingly busy. The ambience is outstanding!  The only thing I might grade them down on was that getting to their parking wasn't easy, given construction. But all things considered, that was minor.  I'll be headed back soon."}
{"text":"My family celebrated my niece's 3rd birthday party here recently. She's really the best child ever. No kidding. They were very accommodating, as we took up two tables and we never felt rushed. Anything we asked for, bags..... extra plates...random other things, they did. Also, the food was great. I had the pasta pomodora without any meat and it was filling and very flavorful. Highly recommended for any group gathering.  The only thing that I saw that made me raise an eyebrow was a manager fussing at a worker about sweeping. There is a Place and manner in which this should be done, and he was rude, seemed completely pissed off and made me feel uncomfortable just watching. Remember people are always watching how you treat your workers and that situation was uncool."}
{"text":"What happened to Brixx? This used to be pretty good, not anymore. Crust is more like hard flavorless cardboard and the service is just plain awful. After sitting there for 45 minutes we finally had to ask what was going on with our order. Something has changed and the pizza just tastes like some cheap frozen thing from the grocery store. If not for their buy one get one coupons I wouldn't step foot in here again. One of our party ordered a salad that was sent back because it pretty much was nothing but lettuce. There are way to many good places for pizza around Charlotte these days to waste your time with this garbage- look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brixx does good wood-fired pizza and it's always consistent when you eat here. Now, I've only had their pizza, but I'm never disappointed with what I order. They are pretty generous with their toppings and it's always a quick, but never rushed, sit down meal. They also have great drink specials throughout the week, including 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday. This spot also has ample parking, even though some of it is mixed in the front and in the back. Overall, not a bad thin-crust wood fired option in the area. I do wish their gluten free crust wasn't a $3 up charge though."}
{"text":"Good place for pizzas , some are sweet read the sauce before ordering.. Else be ready for suprise"}
{"text":"Loved it!! Staff super friendly. Got the Bronx bomber pizza. As a New Yorker, I was surprised. Great crust!! Greek pizza was to die for. Hummus platter was delish, too."}
{"text":"Brixx has been consistent over the past few visits. However, I have a very sincere warning for you: DO NOT ORDER the Korean BBQ Meatballs! These were literally the worst meatballs I have ever tasted. If I don't like something in a restaurant, I will eat it and deal with it, but I had to spit it out. It was crazy mushy with a reallllly poor taste.   On the bright side, the waitress was very friendly and happy to exchange for a Caesar Salad. The pizza was also solid, which it has been the past few times out, hence the upgrade to 4 Stars.   While I focused more on the negative than the positive in this review, I recommend Brixx as long as you do not order the Korean BBQ Meatballs and keep your pizza expectations in check. Additionally....  Eating in Birkdale is usually a good experience. They have movies, ice cream, shops, etc. To add a little fun to tonight's experience, my son and I walked around Birkdale taking a survey: \"What do you think is cooler, a Lamborghini or a Ferrari?\"  When we asked this question, unhappy-looking people suddenly looked happy. They couldn't believe strangers were talking to them. So, it was a cool experience. But ... Lamborghini won 10-7 and I'm a Ferrari guy (don't own one). My son was pleased with the result.   We then went to the bookstore and asked: \"What's cooler, MC Hammer or The Floss?\" MC Hammer took it home by one point. Thank God for that. Uh oh, uh oh."}
{"text":"I go to Brixx a lot with the autistic teen I work with. She loves their pizza, but pizza has been such a turn off since being pregnant since red sauce gives me all sorts of heartburn and acid reflux.  Brixx has a lot of options for pizza without red sauce, which I love!! I've tried the Quattro Formaggi (I sub fontina for the goat cheese since I don't like goat cheese), and the Margherita. Both do not have red sauce, and are wonderful.  I also really like the bruschetta. I lived in Naples, Italy for 7 years and feel that the bruschetta at Brixx is pretty similar, so 5 stars on that!  The girl I work with gets basic pepperoni pizza and Brixx Sticks. Both are good on a regular basis. We also get the lemonade (a small up-charge)-- my favorite is the Root Beer (even though it's not refillable).   Today, I felt that I should actually do a review because our waiter was so great! I think his name is Derek, I'm not sure, and I kind of have a bad memory right now. But, our service exceeded other visits today!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. Half priced bottles of wine are sneaky on Sunday's after a wedding. Let's talk about the real draw here, Robby. Robby is a stud of a server. Long black socks, cargo shorts, and Air Force ones bring in crowds.  Hard to get a spot in his section. Would wait 45 minutes today to be sat with Robby. Looks like a cross country runner but carried 7 drinks at once. Got a 34 on his ACT. Great sense of humor and as majestic as a unicorn. Love, Kayla."}
{"text":"The pizza crust is great and they have a wide selection of pizza. I had the buffalo chicken.  Very good."}
{"text":"I just keep finding myself here. Maybe it's the convenience. It's just down the street from my place. Or maybe it's their pizza. The Bronx Bomber is a pretty darn tasty pizza. Or maybe it's the half price draft beers on Mondays. They do have a nice selection of brews to choose from. I don't know, I just keep ending up here. Any way you slice it (see what I did there), there are some good reasons to visit."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken pizza was excellent. Bomber was good but the fresh oregano over powered everything else. Great beer selection. Service was good."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, reasonable prices and excellent vegan cheese. In particular, besides the pizza, really enjoy their soups as well"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, but over priced and nothing special. Won't be back. Portion sizes are a joke."}
{"text":"Brixx will have many different types of thin crust pizza's.   The flavors are different and varried but they have a huge selection for you to try out.  I got the Bronx which was pretty awesome.  I will have to stop by again and try there other items on the menu whichever looked and smelled great."}
{"text":"Stop in here for some late night food. Was traveling and this was one of the only places open. Got to say I love the decor and the staff was very friendly. I tried to order a Manhattan but they do not have vermouth which saddened me. Otherwise, the food was excellent and fast.  Would def Rec this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This Brixx is close to our house and our go-to Friday night spot. The staff is friendly, the food is good and plentiful, and there are good specials during the week. The Brixx salad keeps me coming back! We love the specialty pizzas. I would say the kids meal pizzas are small, so older kids probably need more."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a baseball game with my boyfriend since I was craving pizza. We got there and it was already late in the evening so it was not very busy. We order the bread sticks which where freshly baked and delicious and the Hawaiian pizza. Both my boyfriend and I agreed that it tasted amazing, the portions aren't that big but the prize is also not bad so can't complain. We are definitely thinking of stopping by again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Brixx on a recent business trip with a few co-workers.  We were promptly seated outside on the patio, which was great.  Our drink orders were taken, so I ordered a glass of water and a glass of cabernet to go with my pizza.  I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza.  A little while later, the food was delivered and the pizza looked very appetizing.  The pizza was fresh and delicious.  The chicken tasted good, was moist and had a good texture.  The BBQ sauce was about as plain as could be, but overall, still good.  This was not life-changing pizza, but it was solid.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the black bean hummus they have as an appetizer! Also, they carry daiya cheese which is very important to me!"}
{"text":"Went back again last night with some friends as we were willing to give it another try. Service was atrocious as our waitress second guessed what we saw written on their chalkboard, \"everyday after 10 pm buy one pizza or app and get one free\" stating that it was only on the weekdays. Heads up, weekends it's 11. While the weekend deal is accurate, it was written on the chalkboard and she second guessed our integrity when reading the \"everyday\" deal.   Showed up around 10:15 pm and everyone in the restaurant looked at us as if we were inconveniencing them. Waitress rushed us into ordering an entre immediately, took over 10 minutes to get a bottle of rose and two beers even though we sat next to the bar.  Check came to the table and the waitress wrote and circled the amount we would have paid without the BOGO deal. Waitress also did not observe the BOGO deal with the two appetizers, but we just wanted to get the hell out at that point.   In short, we're not going back"}
{"text":"Great for outdoor eating.  They also allow pets just outside the gate.  Lots of options on the menu and all are good."}
{"text":"Brixx is okay.  But, I would not say that their pizza is worth the hype people give it.  IMHO, I do not find Brixx to be serving the best wood fired pizza that I have ever had as the crust is too much like a cracker and the toppings usually disappoint in quality. Anyway, on this visit I went with a sandwich.   Atmosphere - Late 80's early 90's feel (mostly w/ the signage), located in an older strip-mall area, nice patio  Food - I had their roast beef sandwich. It was tasty. I liked the focaccia bread Brixx uses and the gorgonzola cheese w/mixed greens and tomatoes was great as opposed to the normal iceberg lettuce other places give you.   Service - It was decent but nothing spectacular. Sitting in the patio area on a nice afternoon added more to the experience than anything else.   Price - $7.95 for the sandwich and chips.   Overall - I have been to three different Brixx locations in my many years in the CLT and I must say...at least they are consistent."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! Got the americo which was great. Bought two, but was pleasantly surprised that there is a late night BOGO special. (I think it was BOGO, my husband paid and it cost about half of what I expected). We were looking for some food after a concert at Bojangles and this was perfect!"}
{"text":"Love the Dilworth and Uptown locations!  It is really the only place I like pizza.  My favorite is the Mexican pizza, but the menu is pretty extensive.  Their hummus is to die for good. This is one of the best restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"Don't cheat yourself out of the Brixx Stix. They're delicious. I enjoy the salads here, the pizza is alright and they have several good pasta dishes. I was in last week and got the pomodoro pasta with chicken. The chicken was really dry and a bummer. Our service was great though. Never had an empty glass but wasn't filled every two seconds...I can't stand that. They are almost always busy, so give yourself some extra time. We like to go here for dinner before heading to the Birkdale theater and sometimes we cut it close after having to wait a little bit for a table."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  I have tried this Brixx location multiple times, and the result is the same.  \"Lumpy\" service, bland pasta and pizza.  The bruschetta and salads are a bright spot, but there are many better choices within a few minutes of here.  It's fully priced and not worth anywhere near what they charge, given the inconsistent service and lack of flavor.  Still wonder how it survives on a busy corner in Dilworth..."}
{"text":"Brixx= Primetime Happy Hour. Working in the ITC, this is a primo location for a place with 15 different beers on tap. Walk across the street from work, stumble back out with immediate access to the \"train.\" Can't go wrong.  Gotsta order the BBQ Chicken Pizza. There's no better drunk food in Charlotte. Last night, got shwasted off their special (you get a free glass when you order a special) and munched on some BBQ Chicken Pizza. I stumbled down 6th, hoping not to get hit by stray bullets coming from the Breakfast Club and made my way into my apartment.   Definitely go to Brixx with coworkers, sit at the bar, and watch PTI. It's a good time, I promise."}
{"text":"The pizza was as close to NYC pizza as possible! The pizzas are wood fired and made to order so they are always fresh! I had the Americo pizza which consists of mozzarella, sliced pepperoni, mushroom and tomato sauce. Before you roll your eyes at this typical pizza, know that it is nothing to sneeze at; the mozzarella is fresh, the pepperonis are thinly sliced and are bursting with flavor as are the mushrooms. The crust was crispy and thin, just like in NYC!   My friend had the buffalo chicken pizza and she sums it up at this: buffalo chicken on a pizza!   The ambience is your typical pizzeria, dim lighting, decent music, and there is a bar available for a few beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"Most of the time I've been to Brixx is because they're having some sort of craft beer event. Yesterday I had a couple of meetings in the downtown area about an hour apart so I decided to stop by and have a couple of beers and a pizza.  The place was deserted but what do you expect for 2pm on a Thursday. My waitress was friendly and attentive. My food came out fast and my beers were poured cold. That visit was good.  In previous visits we've had some major issues with our waitstaff not having even the most remote clue about craft beer. It's always been a pet peeve of mine that craft beer venues do not hire people who know what the heck it is they're serving.  This is the biggest problem I have with Brixx. Aside from that the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is your typical downtown crowd. On weekends it gets incredibly and uncomfortably packed.  I also think it is totally awesome of them to be involve din RAIN's Amazing Bar Crawl which got the the 4th star in my book.  Overall you won't be disappointed. Pretty solid place to hang out, eat some good pizza and drink some good beer."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was even better. Really enjoyed the grilled wings. Much healthier option. The pizza was great and a light thin crust. Would definitely come back. Server was extremely friendly and told us about downloading app to get a free pizza. Will be back"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Brixx. Certain beers were offered at $3 (not sure if it was a happy hour things or it's a certain day of the week), but there were quite a few options available. I opted for the Laguitas IPA. If you're a fan of IPAs, this one is pretty good.   For a meal, I decided on the buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was fresh and delicious. The service was a little slow and parking is a bit limited, but there is parking in the adjacent shopping plaza. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Brixx at both the Foxcroft and  the Blakeney locations. We have always been satisfied with our visits. The food  has always been consistent and good.  This time, we have  decided to try the Dilworth location since we were in the area. I can't unfortunately say that the same experience applies for this location. The only item we both enjoyed, was the Arugula and pear salad. It was good and fresh . As far as the entrees, we ordered the wild mushroom pizza and the vegetable pizza. The arugula on the wild mushroom pizza was wilted and the vegetables on the other pizza didn't look fresh and were not very tasty.The pizza  crust was doughy in the middle. At this point, we would rather go back to the other two locations."}
{"text":"We frequent brix at the different locations in town . The food is always consistent . At this specific location , the service was good . The waiter was good but had some sort of a dry personality . The pizzas were  also good. The crust is absolutely delicious. I ordered the vegetarian pizza which I enjoyed despite the so many broccolis on it . I would go back ."}
{"text":"Awesome & Tasty Appetizers + Great Individual Sized Pizza = Happy Customers!  We ordered 2 appetizers: Bruschetta & Hummus Trio with Wood Fired Pita Chips. Both were delicious and large portions.  Then we each ordered a pizza: Bronx Bomber & Buffalo Chicken w/ Ranch Dressing. We each loved our pizza and I loved that mine came with ranch and didn't cost extra.  Great service, awesome appetizers & the pizza, oh my yum, it was great, the perfect crust!!!"}
{"text":"First ever visit to Brixx pizza and can not say enough about how disappointed I am! Although service was good, food was horrible! My boyfriend ordered the roasted chicken Alfredo and after 2-3 bites had to send the dish back. He did not order a replacement. I had the mozzarella   sandwich with blue chips. While it was edible, nothing at all fabulous. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"I like a good brick oven pizza and this place doesn't disappoint. Wait staff is fast and courteous. On the downside, the food took an abnormally long time - 30-40 minutes for a simple pizza."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Always been good for us and we've visiting 20+ times. Pizzas are consistent and we love the brick over crust.  The salads have been very good as well and seems the service is always top notch - even when really busy. Would like to see more \"quantity\" of toppings - sometimes on the stingy side. But all in all - a good place to be casual and enjoy the food.  We really like the Hawaiian pizza and the BBQ chicken pizza. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I might not have liked the wood fried Pizza. Loved the starters though but not all. Three cheese was good (liked only two of them) and the bread sticks. In general pizza was ok."}
{"text":"Pizza. Quick. Variety. Dependable.   Brixx is always a place you can count on when you need good, quick pizza. They accommodate many allergy related requests and  have a large menu with customized options.   If there is not wait you can likely grab a spot by a tv and catch a sports game or two while you enjoy your food and a beverage. The bar is fully stocked with good beer and decent (not great) wine.   My husband and I never can agree so we both build our own pizzas and take the leftovers home. They have gluten free crust. It's actually good, non-cardboard like and vegan cheese. Win. Win!"}
{"text":"Love Brixx... we go late and take advantage of the BOGO pizza special... pineapple and pepperoni is where it is at. Good drink specials, super cold beer (and a good selection!) and the service is good. Great spot to chill and eat. The rest of the menu is lacking so if you dont want pizza you are kinda SOL... would like a few more app choices but still love the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location with the best servers/bartenders!  I've never had a bad pizza at Brixx.  Also, the salads are great too.  They have takeout too and it is easy to park.  Sit outside if it is warm."}
{"text":"Pizza? Is that what its supposed to be? I was excited because it was rated well but hey I come from Brooklyn and I never saw a pizza like that before.  Yuck"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish I had jotted the name of the manager, bartender, and lovely waitress my friend and I had today for lunch at Brixx! Not only did they get creative when sharing some beer tastings after I inquired about some new brews on the menu, but they checked on us frequently and our lunch was delish AND affordable. $8 for a salad and a mini pizza?! Count me in :)  I have noticed that CU is missing out on real hospitality these last few years and I think Brixx has really stepped up to the plate to offer friendly, professional, and pleasant staff. I'm sad I don't think of their bar more often for happy hours- they've got a solid beer selection and great 'za that would be easy to share with friends and coworkers!  Keep it up Brixx folks!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!   I just left Brixx.  I have been to this location many times.  It's frustrating how inconsistent it is.  Sometimes it's great - good prices, good atmosphere, good food.  But I have had a number of bad experiences here and tonight was one of them.    This waiter could not have been worse.  We had to to inside from the patio 3 times to get plates, to go boxes, the check....  And the quality of the food is totally inconsistent.  Tonight's red sauce was so sweet that I could barely stomach it.    Brixx, do yourself a favor and FIRE the horrible waiter who was working after 10PM.  He was totally inattentive and seemed that he could not have cared less about servicing guests."}
{"text":"Brixx isn't the very best pizza I have ever had, but they offer a very unique and yummy menu.    They have a thinner, lighter pizza that is topped with quality ingredients. On a good day I can eat an entire pizza on my own. My favorite pizza has to be the pear & Gorgonzola pie. I wouldn't normally think I'd like pear on my pizza, but it is a great switch-up from the traditional toppings.   Make sure to visit their website before you go; they have a monthly coupon!"}
{"text":"I am so lucky!  I won a free dinner here courtesy of the LGBT Film Festival simply because they happened to draw my name. We scored outside seating at the East Boulevard location.  They had a nice beer list and wine as well.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip to start.  It was served with pita bread and tasty.  My husband and I had a lot of fun telling each other that there was flecks of spinach in our teeth. We ordered the mushroom pizza also.  Crisp crust with flavorful toppings. We requested a pasta dish to go that featured tomatoes and basil.  Generous portion!  We were able to share it the next evening. Even if we don't win another free dinner here, we will return."}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed. The wait was an hour which turned in to more like 1.5 hrs because it started storming. Not their fault on the wait because they had to close the outdoor seating. The staff was at the end of their rope. I was sitting next to the hostess as she was muttering under her breath about people taking so long. Usually I would just brush that off but I found it really unprofessional since there was a 4-top, a 2-top and a booth waiting to be cleaning and the hostess was doing nothing to help. We got to our table and the waitress was ok. She did her part. We ordered the hummis appetizer, a margarita pizza and the 4x4 pizza. I forgot to take pictures because we were all starving. The hummus appetizer was good. Pitas were warn and dusted with a seasoning that tasted like a cross between a nacho chip and chilli. The hummus itself was different. Very think and not blended smooth. I'd eat it again but the pizza, that's a different story. The 4x4 was a salt lick and I don't normally mind salt but this was awful. The Salt over powered everything. The crust was good it had a nice chewy texture. The same goes for the margarita Pizza, crust was good. The taste of the margarita was ok. We're used to having it with a tomato sauce base so my wife was a little confused. She needs Pizza with sauce because it helps everything slide down. I'd order it again because I didn't think it was bad but the experience of the Holy place was kind of disappointing. This was an ok place if you have kids, but if you are trying to have a conversation then I would skip it. You are practically yelling for the server to hear you and having a conversation across the table without yelling is almost impossible. I really wanted this to be a good place. :-("}
{"text":"Above average thin crust pizza. The staff was great. Nice looking restaurant. It won't knock your sox off but it's a good experience. They have a lot of options with your pizza."}
{"text":"First time coming into this place. Let me start by saying clean cut and extremely modern. They have a nice size beer and wine collection, that compliments the pizza and salad combination. I sat at the bar and was greet by a handsome gentleman who helped me navigate through the menu. This place is simple and perfect for a family night."}
{"text":"If you want the all around good service, good food spot, this is the place to be! They've really gotten this whole restaurant thing figured out. Drinks always refilled, hot food comes out hot, salads come out quick! I have nothing negative to say! The pizza is amazing! BBQ chicken and the mushroom pizzas are the best! They use to have a spicy bacon Ceasar pizza that was amazing!  Love sitting on the patio during the nice weather days and people watching lol."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and wasn't really that thrilled but I have been a handful of other times where I have been a bit more impressed so I landed in the middle for my rating.  The good:  The hummus, their pizzas are decent if you like thin crust and mostly cheese and I like that they will split two different kinds on one personal pizza.  There is one grilled chicken wrap that is pretty good and their side items are decent....I like the fresh fruit bowl and the corn and black bean salad is a good side option as well.  The bad:  Most of their salads leave MUCH to be desired and if you add chicken just go ahead and plan on gnawing on it for a good 5 minutes before it's safe to swallow.  Also, the pesto chicken salad wrap is mostly wrap so that was no good.  The reality:  It is what it is.  It is a semi-affordable lunch spot but I think the Blakeney location is better than Fairview for some reason.  Some things are fresh and done well and other things are just not quite up to par.  I don't seek out going to Brixx but sometimes it is conveniently located and a better option than its neighboring fast food joints."}
{"text":"Don't order the Banh Mi sandwich. It was nasty! It was missing daikon and carrots. Pork was similar to bbq pork without the sauce. Bread was soggy. I would not have known it was a Banh Mi sandwich. Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service always is a pleasure to dine there"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been to Brixx, but had a pizza craving tonight so I made the call for pick-up, and learned they now offer curb-side pick-up, a definite bonus tonight in the rain. I ordered the Caesar Salad, which was ok. The lettuce was ok, however a lot of wilted pieces, but the focaccia bread was fresh. As for the pizza, I chose the Roasted Chicken. It was hot & fresh, but was a little underdone, at least in the middle. I ended up cutting the middle out and enjoyed the good crust."}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner at 8:30 pm. The place was busy but no wait for seating. After being seated it took about 10 minutes for a waitress to stop by our table just to tell us she would be with us soon. When we finally placed our orders the pizza came out of the kitchen very quickly. (Not brought by the waitress - but a kitchen staff member) The pizza was very tasty, my husband tried the Thai Chicken and I had the pear and Gorgonzola. We both enjoyed our pizza however it took a long time for drink refills etc. So overall if you like unique pizzas, are patient and not in a hurry you might enjoy Brixx."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch yesterday. Brixx is one of those places that I only go when someone else suggested it. Nothing against it, just kind of overpriced if I just want a slice of pizze (think Fuel). Decent lunch crowd. Getting in and out of their parking lot can be a test to patience. Luckily I wasn't driving. We got a booth immediately, which was surprising. We also were greeted very quickly. I ordered the roast chicken club (and I switched it to a baguette instead of focaccia) with a side of black bean salad. Lunch mate ordered the typical plain cheese pizza. My sandwich was $8.95... ok price I suppose. The chicken was very dry, and lacked flavor. Only redeeming quality was the garlic aioli sauce which looked and tasted alot like garlic butter... you won't hear me complain though. I lathered my sandwich all up with that stuff, and salt and pepper a little and created a better tasting sandwich. The baguette was excellent in itself. I don't know how much the pizza was, since it's a plain cheese. I took 2 bites, and I found it soggy at the bottom.  Lastly, our server likes to disappear. He did well with my hot water, but he never brought a refill for the coke until we were ready for the check.  And oh, I HATE that lousy to-go box, they should consider an alternative box choice. All in all, 2 stars due to lack of value, lack of food quality, and below average service."}
{"text":"Always my to go place for late night snacks and pizza. Never disappointed with the options. Always great. Keep it up."}
{"text":"My wife and I too our kid on a train ride uptown and had planned on eating at 7th Street Market, which was too crowded.  We remembered brixx being around the corner and headed over there.  We had a BOGO coupon for an entree there so decided to beat the crowd and get our little one fed.  We each ordered the excellently priced Lunch meal - a personal pizza with a salad - awesome since you can choose any of their pizzas and are not confined to the standard Pep or plain cheese.  I ordered the greek, and she a Peperoni.  We ordered our kid buttered noodles, because, well, he's a 4 year old that likes to say \"I no like it\" in a whiny voice.    We tried a beer that was on special - it was fruity, but that's not their fault - you have to try something to figure out if you like it.  Our waiter was new and was very friendly and enthusiastic.  He kept our waters filled and always had a smile.  Our pizza came out after a longer than anticipated wait as we watched people leave.    When the pizza did come out, it was the biggest issue.  I bit into the pizza to discover that it had arrived cold.  The cheese was melted, but it was only warm.  The real nasty part was that the sauce, toppings, and even the crust were cold to the touch.  My wife started poking into her pizzas as well and found it was cold to the touch also.  We asked for some new ones, and had to remind the trainer assisting our waiter than we would eat our salads, that had also thankfully arrived cold!  Our new pizzas came out faster than our original pizzas did, and they were cooked properly.    This is really a 2.5 star visit - the service was friendly, the price was good, but the food was just a disappointment.  The pizza just want that good and made me wish we had waited for the pizza inside of the 7th street market - it looked extremely unhealthy and delicious.  I remember Brixx being better in the past, so I hope this is just a bad visit."}
{"text":"Four great reasons to head over to Brixx before the Hornet's game:  1) Who wants to pay $10 a beer in the arena when you can pregame here with a great selection of local drafts.  2) If you haven't had the Chicken Thai pizza you have been missing out. 3) They validate parking, its basically getting $10-15 knocked off your bill. 4) If you check in on yelp you get a free appetizer...you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Party of 12 on a Saturday? Lets try BW in Savoy... oh wait, it's a UFC night. They didn't even offer a wait time, just sort of laughed and were like \"yeah right\". So, we're like \"where do you want to go?\" looked around (while standing outside bw) and there's restaurants all over the place. How about the BBQ place right next to Tucks... \"i don't like bbq\" why not \"i don't like bbq\" THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS!!! Applebees? It's right there... no... geebus... how about... (name every restaurant)... finally... BRIXX. She calls, yes, we can get in. Whoo hoo a decision!!! Drive down the street, drive around the building a couple times, hoping to find a parking spot. That may be the worst thing about BRIXX, is the parking is terrible.  Go inside, seated right away. Oddly, only know 1 person who was working there, and she was the hostess (i believe).  Menu's are passed. Beer list is perused. Hey, look, there's always a Triptych on tap. That's great. The draft list is all craft, and that's awesome. There are no macros on tap. I assume this is upsetting to many people the first (maybe only?) time they go there. \"What do you mean you don't have bud light on tap???\" I'd assume is asked by crusty old people. \"Back in my day, a restaurant would have Budweiser, Miller, Coors AND Pabst on tap! I suppose I can't even get a HAMM'S in here?!?!?!\" Hey, whaddyaknow, they have macros in bottles. \"Well, why didn't you tell me that?\"   Craft food deserves craft beer.  The lady and I both order the Triptych, the Blue and the Gold. She believes it tastes better than when it was at the brewery, so that's odd. Beer is promptly served. It doesn't appear that it was in a frosty pint glass either, so that's good too. There is also craft rootbeer on tap, so that's cool. They seem to have some staples in intro craft, like Fat Tire, Sam Adams, but the list is nice. It's not going to be a place to go to for \"I've never even HEARD of this beer\" (from the craft beer drinkers) but the BMC drinkers will be exclaiming that, except in anger.  I order the 4x4. So does the lady.  The manager brings over a Mediterranean salad, apparently an extra one had been made, and he decided to bring it to our table (he must know i'm a yelper!... or maybe he's just nice). Bill eats the salad. Courtney eats the bread, she seemed to like the bread.  Others at the table ordered other things. Court got the ravioli, the waitress was awesome and asked if she wanted the tomatoes on it, and court was like no. The waitress was awesome, did i mention that. She was like \"i'm a picky eater too, and you look like you'd be a picky eater\" which was really nice. There were 2 young boys in our group, and they went over and drew on the chalkboard, and one of the bussers brought them out extra chalk to draw with, and that was really nice. Man, those people were really nice.  The pizzas come out. I devour mine. Apparently, the reason i don't really like pizza is the sauce. The 4x4 doesn't have red sauce, it's an olive oil. So, maybe that's why i don't like pizza. Who knew? I remember as a kid, eating some frozen pizzas, every now and then, one of those Tino's (or similar) would have a sauce that we would call \"watermelon pizza\". I also hate pizza hut. As a youth, when John and I would drive around Pontiac, we'd sometimes eat at pizza hut. Well, we'd drink... sometimes too much. It was then that i discovered the acidity in the pizza hut sauce is almost exactly the same acidity that is regularly in my stomach. So, when i'd throw up from drinking too much, it would taste exactly the same. As an adult, I don't drink to that point.  So, the 4x4 was amazing.  I don't do desert.  Kansas was losing the first half of the game while I was there. I leave and they win by like 20, wtf? Tres Tinkle was having a great first half. I leave and suddenly Kansas remembers how to play? The 3 bean salad was great. Not a typical three bean salad either. Red beans, black beans and garbanzos (i realize everyone poops, but that doesn't mean i want to see chick pee's!)"}
{"text":"I went here for an early dinner at six on a Friday.  We were told to sit anywhere we wanted, so we sat outside and the. Proceeded to wait for 15 minutes before anyone paid attention to us and then we had to ask them for menus.    As always, I needed all my food strictly gluten free as I have celiac disease.  I called ahead to check their practices and they use proper procedures to ensure nothing touches anything that has gluten.    I ordered the spinach salad which at first came with croutons (but no read, so they got that right).  The waiter immediately got me a new one when I noticed and alerted him.  The salad without croutons was good but way overdressed and only had one vegetable.  What is it with restaurants these days? Why do salads usually only have one green and vegetable?  I had the 4x4 gluten free pizza which was alright.  It comes on a separate aluminum pan which is nice but the crust is not that great.  It is not at all crisp and it is kind of squishy/foamy.  The toppings were good but when has four cheeses and meats ever not been good?  All I all it was a nice experience to sit outside with my dinner date and eat, but not the best food."}
{"text":"Yum! yum! yum! Loved it! Food, service, ambience every thing is awesome here please try this place."}
{"text":"It was late & nothing was open. Or so it seemed. A staff member at my hotel recommended this place. I'm glad I came. I ordered the Americo, simple pepperoni, mushrooms (I added olives,) it was fresh & delicious. I didn't catch her name but a pretty blonde lady was taking care of everything, very nice & fast which I appreciated. I'd like to try other menu items if I'm still in town."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to try this place. Lots of options and fresh ingredients. Not quite as flavorful and a little less generous on the amount of toppings for the price, but overall a good place for pizza and drinks!"}
{"text":"I love a good brick oven pizza, and this was a great place to grab one. First thing I want to say though is the pizza style. This isn't NY-style, which is what I'm used to (since I'm from NY.) It's more a California style in that it's a thin crust and offers some unique topping options. In the end, I was a fan.  I ordered the Jerked Chicken pizza. It had some spicy jerked chicken on it along with pineapple salsa, onions and gouda cheese. My wife ordered the pear gorgonzola pizza that came with thin pear slices, carmelized onions and a gorgonzola cheese. We ended up splitting both pizzas so we each had two slices of each, and then took four slices home for lunch the following day. Mind you, they both also had mozzarella cheese, but neither had tomato sauce, so in that respect it wasn't your traditional pizza.  We both loved the pear/gorgonzola pizza. All the flavors combined sooo well, and the smokiness of the gorgonzola complimented the overall pizza very well. The jerked chicken was also good, and had a nice spice to it, but the gorgonzola definitely outshone the other one.  One last thing I want to mention is the beer. They had a beer list of at least fifteen brewers, the vast majority of which were local, or at least based out of the Carolinas. Each glass is $4.50 or you can get a sampler of four for $4.50. I almost got the sampler until the waitress mentioned that tonight was \"$1.95 Draft Monday\", so I was totally sold with that. I got one of the local IPAs and it was darn tasty. My wife had the White Belgium Ale and that was good as well.  My only complaint was that the waitress was very slow. We waited quite a bit of time between finishing up and getting out, and it wasn't too busy. Also, she never came by to see how everything was (not that she needed to since the food was amazing) but the manager did pop by to see how things were, so at least someone cared about us.  I highly recommend getting your pizza on here!"}
{"text":"Late night happy hour -- two-for-one pizzas and appetizers after 10 p.m. Sunday - Thursday and 11 p.m. Friday & Saturday!  We arrived around 10:30p yesterday for some late dinner, I haven't been to Brixx before and I was interested in how good the pizzas were..so late night was the best time to try. There was also $1.95 domestic drafts which was also cool.   I was surprised to find a large, unique pizza items which was pretty nice. We ordered the Mexican pizza, the black been spread sounded good, and the Caribbean Jerk pizza. It took a while to come out, but it was worth it. They were both delicious. My favorite part: the veggies were so fresh and the chicken was tender. This is pretty hard to find when ordering from your large chains like Dominos or Pizza Hut. The pizzas were also really big too, it was about the size of a dinner plate, with the ample toppings..two and a half slices left me full. I love the cumin flavor that came out of the black bean spread on the Mexican pizza and the extremely fresh pineapple bits on the jerk pizza. There is also fresh sliced jalapeños on the Mexican pizza, with seeds, so if you don't like spicy you might want to order it without them. Over all, very unique and yummy!   Our bill for the 2 fresh, well portioned personal pizzas and a pint was $13. Totally worth it, we will definitely be back...with friends. Hit up late night happy hour when you have the time"}
{"text":"This is for my last takeout experience, I ordered after 10p on Sunday for the BOGO pizza deal, $10 isn't bad for the 2 unique pizzas. As always, I ordered the Mexican and Jerk Chicken pizzas. I was given 15 minutes till it was ready, the place was packed when I went to pick this order up. I took forever just to get the bartender's attention just to pick up my pizzas. It took about 10 minutes just to pick up food. At home, I was upset to find this Brixx location had messed up my order. I received a veggie pizza? ( broccoli and other random veggies), I'm not sure how they got \"veggie\" from \"Mexican\" over the phone. It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't what I ordered and was sad as the Mexican is my all time fav from Brixx. The Jerk Chicken pizza was good but it looked very sloppy, the toppings were uneven and splattered all over the pizza dough. These pizzas were clearly not made with love.   I'll be checking my boxes next time I order from this location, the Dilworth location has never let me down like this."}
{"text":"i've determined there is no good food in NC. this place is decent enough though. especially since the outdoor seating is nice since birk is always busy and affords fun people watching.  i like the option to use whole-wheat dough for your pizza instead of the nutrition-less white. lol  if you've had real nyc pizza, this stuff sucks. if not, i suggest it.   they also have a fun beer special, if you're into that. i am not, but i once partook of the beer sampler (four mini cups of beers you select).  if you are in birkdale village and hungry, check it out.  i dislike the indoor seating: it is too noisy and cramped."}
{"text":"This place is great casual dining! Every server we've had has been great. If you have the option to eat in patio, eat there of the weather is nice. The atmosphere and people and dog watching is real nice. Last night we sat by the large window by front door which my kids enjoyed. I couldn't decide between a pizza or a salad so I went with spicy BLT which was great. It's salad ontop of pizza with tasty long strips of bacon and fresh sliced hot jalepenos, romaine tossed in dressing with tomatoe!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. We always tend to bring our guests here, as it's not crazy busy like Bad Daddy's can be, but not so expensive of a bar/restauranty place as some other places in Birkdale. We usually have some kind of coupon or you can check in on Yelp and get a great deal. They have a nice bar area, and great outdoor seating too. The times we've come, we have had nice service and the food doesn't take too long either.   Pizza is really delicious - my favorite part is the crust, which is something that my 5 year old self is cringing about! We've had some pizzas I'm not a huge fan of here, but it's totally personal preference. I really liked the Mexican pizza and the Thai pizza."}
{"text":"Very pleasant service and visible management. THe food is well done and consistent.I've been here approximately 3 times and every experience has been what you would expect from a respectable restaurant."}
{"text":"It is a cookie-cutter style, but that's why I like it. No matter which Brixx I go to in Charlotte, it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"Always had excellent service here and the food is great. I love the Bruschetta! Not to mention they have a pretty solid beer selection, one of only two places in Gastonia where you can get Red Oak. We love coming here plus they are open late with buy one get one pizzas!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! What's not to love about a place that serves quality food, has exceptional staff, and has great pricing! I always get the custom wood-fired pizza. And it is delicious. It has that authentic, rustic taste on the crust. The cheese is perfectly melty while the toppings add great flavor. The staff is also very nice here. There is plenty of seating and it is a great place for friends or family. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience at Brixx. The staff was extremely rude and lacked customer service qualities. If they put as much effort into servicing the customer as they did talking amongst themselves they would get more accomplished. The food was over priced and sloppy. I don't mind paying for over priced food if the service is outstanding but im not going to be made to feel uncomfortable and pay for it. Two thumbs down. Try a different place."}
{"text":"In town for business and while walking through the birkdale village the smell got to me! Ordered a Margherita Pizza and it was good! The service was great, flavor was a little bland. Would love to try others next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I always love the spicy Thai chicken pizza here. Unlike any other pizza place and I come here specifically for this pizza. My husband always gets the chicken florentine which also never disappoints. I prefer brixx over mello mushroom any day!"}
{"text":"Great location in Birkdale Village. The food is always excellent! The servers we have had are friendly and prompt. Their beer selection is huge and they always have a special. Also one of my favorites is the sample beers where you can try 4 or 5 different ones. My absolute favorite part of Brixx is they are open late AND they have BOGO with pizza and appetizers late night! The employees are great at reminding you too so you can get your free item! Oh and try the s'more pizza! YUM! (My fav is the buffalo pizza though!!)"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday evening for Dinner with the wife and daughter. We have been here a few times each summer when we visit and have always found it comfortable with very little wait, if any. The food was very good. We each got a pizza. For those with gluten allergies like my wife, the handmade crust was very tasty with good texture on the crust which is hard to do. We were sad to hear the music trivia went away on Fridays but those are the times. Still, I recommend this place... Prices are reasonable, staff if well trained and courteous, and it's close to the convention center and the train/tram. Be sure to sign up for the mailing list, the coupons are a good deal."}
{"text":"Trash. Waiter threw away half my leftovers when asked for a to go box. The pizza was not very good. And also did not refill glass barely any. Glass stayed empty nearly the whole time I was at the table. VERY negative experience. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, their pizza is good but I think the spaghetti and meatballs are to die for and the Mediterranean salad is delicious!!! I can never say no to going here:)"}
{"text":"Hmmm,went there for lunch today with a group of eight from work. Decent pizza served lukewarm and not cut into separate pieces. Horrible , rude service  I'll never go back"}
{"text":"The pear salad is awesome! Pizza is Always great! Wish they had a bigger wine selection but always good eats!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Brixx.  I haven't had a bad pizza in here yet - and it doesn't seem like I will.  One of the perks of being downtown is going to Brixx for lunch... but definitely a great dinner place as well.  It's located underneath 7th street station parking deck so there is always plenty of parking.  Haven't really gone here to drink, but they have a good selection of beers to go alone with your pizza.  Looks like the place has a full bar as well.  There is outdoor seating for when it is warmer and the wait staff are pretty friendly.  When I was here last Saturday, they were having trivia - which looked fun.  May try it sometime."}
{"text":"Brixx is a Charlotte-based pizza chain but it's not your typical pizza joint.  This is a place with creative pizza toppings and the pies are cooked in a brick oven (hence the name Brixx, i presume).  It's been a while since I've been in this location of Brixx but it is my favorite even though there are two others that are closer to me.  This location is in the first floor of the 7th Street Station Parking Garage.  I remember this location to be a little brighter inside but it was not this time around.  I guess I need to get here more often to see the changes.  In fact it was rather dark that it was difficult to read menus even with the small light against the wall of the booth.  One good thing I will give Brixx is they have a decent selection of local beers of draft (OMB, Four Friends, Birdsong and NoDa were all represented).    As for food, well I felt jipped with my Caribbean Shrimp Pizza.  There was all this dough and not much in toppings.  I personally prefer my pizzas loaded with toppings.  But 5 shrimp really didn't make this worth the bread.  And service was odd here.  There were times that our server was constantly checking on us which was bit annoying because it didn't give you a chance to enjoy anything and then things slacked off where you didn't hear from her.  And it seemed like extra effort to ask if we wanted separate checks.  But at least she split them up corrected after we finally asked.  I'd come here for the beer more than the pizza.  For Pizza, I'll stick to the local Italian places where I know I can get a loaded pie without having to ask and pay extra for it."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Brixx in years and went with family when in Charlotte late night a few weeks back. Split a 4x4 and Mexican pizzas and they were great!  I will definitely be returning to Brixx!"}
{"text":"We attempted to go to Positano Osteria and Dressler's first, but both were closed until 5, so we ended up at Brixx instead. The spinach-artichoke dip was pretty good, although a bit mayonnaise-y for my taste. I really like the fact that they offer whole-wheat pizza crusts and vegan cheese as options. The topping combinations were pretty standard as far as woodfire-pizza places go (chicken pesto, margherita, etc), but the ingredients were nice and fresh. I was hoping for something a little more adventurous and unique, though. On the bright side, our service was prompt and friendly. Overall, it was a satisfactory experience and I have no real complaints; I just found myself wishing that some of the more interesting restaurants in the area had been open."}
{"text":"The ingredients were sub par and lacked flavor, the pizza was average as a result. It was expensive for pizza which is a very competitive market particularly in a college town! On top of it all our waiter was inattentive and never asked about how we liked the food or if our drinks needed freshened. An overall disappointment."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. The bruschetta is simply delicious as is the pizza. We live 45 minutes away and it is totally worth the drive. If your near by stop in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Oh Brixx how I miss you (I've since moved to Boston). I would eat their spinach and artichoke dip everyday if it was socially acceptable... Best barbecue chicken pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"We went to Brixx quite a few times when we first moved up to LKN.  Oh look, cool pizza place in this cool Birkdale Village place, and it's always got a crowd.  Then, over time, we found more and better options and the visits all but ceased with the most recent being April of 2011.   Next visit was yesterday because the in-laws picked it.  Result... same ole, same ole.  This place is so mediocre and, in some aspects just down right bad.    How in the world can you possibly cook a thin crust pizza so it still turns out with a doughy interior?  Not sure but, if you're interested in learning, come ask the folks here at Brixx.  Unfortunately I was pretty hungry when we walked in so I ordered a Caesar salad ahead of the pizza.  What I received was a bunch of tired old Romaine (posting a pic of the brown lettuce ribs as soon as I next open my Yelp app), with out of a bottle tasting dressing and out of a box flavorless croutons.  Blecchh!"}
{"text":"Very good.  I am more of a standard Pizza Hut kind of person, not impressed by artichoke and marshmallow or whatever on pizza.    So I figured I'd skip this place since it was probably all that new-age pizza.   Well, it's both that and good for boring people like me.  I got the Meatball Pizza, and I was satisfied.   And the Cubs were coming on TV at the bar upon my exit and I was sad that I had to go back to work."}
{"text":"A very eager to please staff. The pizza's taste isn't coherent... everything on the menu tastes exactly like the separate ingredients listed. You can't really go too wrong with pizza, though.  P.S.: Smores pizza? Really?  EDIT: Hardworking manager. Kudos to the staff and their efforts."}
{"text":"Came here due to it's proximity to the Holiday Inn hotel.  High school graduations were going on at the TWC arena and the restaurant was pretty busy.  Luckily, our party of two was seated quickly.  We weren't that hungry so we decided to share an app and a pizza.  We started with the Pimento Cheese and Pita Chips.  It doesn't happen often, but there was a perfect quantity of dip to chips ratio.  Nice work, Brixx.  The Pimento cheese was good, not great.  We shared the 4X4 pizza that has four cheese and four meats.  The pizza here has a thin crust and was a nice size for two people to split.  I didn't really taste the goat cheese or the gouda that were supposed to be on the pizza but the flavors may have been overwhelmed by the meats.  Service was good and efficient.  I'd been to a Brixx before and this visit met my expectations.  The main reason we avoided Fuel pizza is because it didn't sell alcohol."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant, and lifelong pizza addict, I've been determined to find which pizza place in Charlotte will get my recurring business. This is the first sit down pizza restaurant I've been to so far. I visited on a weekday, early evening. The weather was still nice, so I sat on the patio.  My companion ordered the shrimp carbonara and I chose the 4x4 pizza. The service was attentive, great atmosphere with a large amount of customers. The pizza was thin, not too thin, but held up well with all the toppings. I couldn't get enough! I had a few bites of my friends pasta which was also delicious.  I was very pleased, and will definitely come back to enjoy the other pizza pies on their menu."}
