{"text":"We had an excellent dinner in a fine dining atmosphere allowing casual attire.  It's a small place and intimate with great service, wine, and food."}
{"text":"Despite some of the other reviews on here. I believe this restaurant is a hidden gem.  Classic decor paired with a unique dining experience.  The staff is always attentive and food is well above par. Fresh bread is always brought out to us, unlike other places where its not even warm.  My favorite dish to get is the gnocchi rosé, try this place out for a nice romantic experience by candlelight and get cozy."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and attentive. The food was good. I had the goat cheese and it was delicious. The service may have been slow but who wants to feel rushed?  I would recommend a stop in here I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I've been on a date to Frascati twice, the food is okay, nothing remarkable, but nothing disappointing. The desserts are boring and typical. Would go back but the server we had, both times is very odd. She's a mature lady, who you'd think would know how to take command of her role, but she is mousy and kind of useless. She kind of shyly hovers around, and needs to be coached on how to do everything. It felt like we were being served by someones very respectful but super awkward and skittish teenage daughter on the first day at a new job. By the look of it though she was well over 40 and had been there for at least 6 months since that's how long it was that we hadn't been there. On the plus side, they are open on Sundays, which is why we went back."}
{"text":"The food was just okay....scallops were overcooked, they could have used some greens to color the chicken piccata dish. Only one CD playing over and over....not a bad place, just not awesome in any sense."}
{"text":"Quiet small restaurant.  Pasta was excellent.  Service was attentive.  Patrons at least when we were there were all 50+.  Great place for a nice dinner with family."}
{"text":"Fake Italian food. Service was horrible. I was there on a Saturday night and there was only one waiter with a hostess who's probably the owner. Waited 1 hour to get main course. No service in-between. Definitely a pass. Don't waste your time here. Go to donatelo next store."}
{"text":"Had such a lovely time, service was great even though it was busy on a weekday, great appatizers, complimentary bread, delicious pasta, I definitely recommend one of their lobster specials! Decent prices, good wine, these earlier reviews are definitely dated, delish!"}
{"text":"The family and I were looking for a nice Restaurant after a long day of sightseeing, we stumbled upon Frascati by chance, the menu looked great and the series of local reviews and awards in the window looked great.  Our family of 3 kids (7-11) and two adults were dressed casually so we were glad to see a great place that was open to casual dress.

First and foremost the restaurant was very nice, small/cozy and I would say romantic but we had our kids!  great selection of wine priced in the $34-$100 range and the several entrees we tried were all great.  The did not have a kids menu but split entrees so that was great.  

The service (Woman) who greeted and attended our table was excellent with the kids and on her suggestions for entrees. 

So for a date, this is a nice place on a nice quiet street near downtown. For a family, I was impressed,  no crayons or kids menu but a half order of spaghetti with meat balls was a hit as was the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Frascati is a decent place for dinner. The atmosphere is definitely more suited towards the elder generation with a sort of peaceful, comforting homey feel. The menu didn't have a whole lot of variety, offering your very typical Italian pastas and meats. Tasted the spaghetti and meatballs, linguini frascati with shrimp and vegetables, and seafood linguini. The spaghetti had a nice light tomato sauce and the seafood was cooked well, but nothing really stood out from any of the dishes. The two linguini sauces (garlic olive oil and garlic white wine) were not as flavourful as I'd have liked, with a very minimal amount of garlic/herbs/chili flakes mixed in with the olive oil.

Portions were a good size for the price. Service was very slow however; we had to wait quite a long time for the waitstaff to take our orders and an hour for our food to come."}
{"text":"Wandering through the city after a TIFF screening we found this gem! We started with a nice bottle of red, delicious warm bread and some Caesar salads. He ordered the Penne Arrabbiate, which they tell you is spicy because it actually is. He enjoyed it very much even though it made his nose run. I accidentally just ordered a steak instead of the brandy peppercorn that I had intended to order. No worries though, it was delicious and served with some fried potatoes, broccoli, carrots and green beans. YUMMY! The only thing I didn't like was the mushrooms served on top because they were bit tangy like they were cooked in lemon juice. I even ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it was also tasty. I'd go back next time we're in town and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was great  would go again! Romantic atmosphere. Very homey vibe. Their menu has many different options to choose from and they have a decent wine list.  The staff were so pleasant and engaging, and I would definitely go again! Thank you very much for the wonderful evening :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience.

We were walk-ins on NYE of all nights and were seated promptly. The lady that attended to us was knowledgeable, engaging and very efficient at her job. Our table wanted for nothing, as our glasses of water were never empty. Their cuisine was exceptional, with steak that simply melted in your mouth, paired with potatoes and veggies that were seasoned to perfection. Their dessert selection was light and the perfect end to our meal. The red wine that accompanied our meal was delicious and paired nicely with their steak, the bottle of bubbly we toasted the end of the night with was an excellent end to a great year and the beginning of a wonderful new year to come. 
We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Frascati's decor is classic but not amazing a little old school but nice. The service is okay but they don't have enough waiter's to serve the tables. The hostess is the waitress. And the busboy is the waiter. Also the staff doesn't come around at all unless you are a local person eating here. There not very nice to unlocal people. But it got a lot better as the time went by. Another thing I didn't like is that you have to walk up stepp steps to the bathroom. The room is very small they need to upgrade. The price is really reasonable for the food it's not so expensive as the other hotels.The food takes really long to come out you wait for hours. And lastly food is average. Not bad but there are a lot better restaurants in Toronto for a little more money. That's why I give this 3 stars."}
{"text":"A previous experience had been quite delightful & I attended this time with a companion, to whom I had shared this with. Sadly, things were not at all the same with respect to food quality only. 
The service and attention were impeccable. The Wine list was extensive but the tomato sauce on my Veal Parmigiana tasted as if it had come from a jar at the supermarket. The portion was skimpy, in view of the price. My friend had chicken Marsala and the verdict was bland. The appetizer mussels were drowned in the same sauce as the veal parmigiana. The prominent flavour of garlic in most Italian cooking was noticeably absent. 
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The place is overpriced for what you get. The scallops were over cooked and the dish did not resemble anything Italian. The dishes are nothing special, and the service is okay, but that's because no one is in there. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The décor is a bit dated, but the food and service were pretty good.

Staff: Seated quickly, the food is a little slower than I would've preferred. The staff were friendly and attentive though.

Ambience: The décor has an old European vibe. The purple doors confused me.

Food: I had the Grilled Calamari to start and it definitely tasted a bit burnt and it was heavy on the vinaigrette with the accompanying salad. For my main I had the Fettuccine all Pollo which was very tasty. Great flavours, pasta was nice and soft (not the usual al dente, which I thoroughly enjoyed it). It was yummy, but I wish they did more with the chicken because it was just diced and didn't seem to add anything to the dish.

A nice option if you're in the area because it is close to Yonge and Dundas Square."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent recommendation by our waiter. Warm bread was delicious, as was the very flavorful bruschetta. I had the special which was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The perfect place for my graduation celebration with my family. We came here on a recommendation from a family friend who has been coming since the day they opened. The food was delicious, bruschetta was fresh and tasty. I had the special of the day which was spaghetti with shrimp, the sauce was flavourful and the dish had almost 15 large shrimp! My family enjoyed their meals equally as much. Definitely would come back."}
