{"text":"Wow. A great surprise to see Road Kill Grill at the shooting complex. The brisket was excellent and the mac n cheese amazing as usual. Trey smokes some fantastic ribs, fall off the bone tender and seasoned perfectly.Trey is very personable, great service and was proud of his ribs. Watch out Road Kill 1"}
{"text":"Today I treated three couples to lunch at Road Kill Grill II.  None of them had been to the Shooting Range before and only three of us had eaten food from the original Road Kill Grill.  Trey, the waiter/manager/do-all guy was fantastic and was very patient with a group of old timers.  We all loved the food, the atmosphere and the great treatment as valued guests. We all had pork ribs, plus one of my guests had the brisket.  All were delicious, which I've grown to expect from the Road Kill Grill.  I highly recommend it to everyone for a fun and different experience."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would!!! Ive eaten bbg all over the country, and this is one of the best...hands down amazing. The ribs, hot links, brisket, pulled pork are superb. Tuesday & Thursdays they have melt in your mouth tritip, so freaking good. My absolute favorite is the baked beans. It's loaded with brisket & tritip meat, onion, jalapeno...you better order extra, you're going to want more. Chuck and his staff are some if the nicest, welcoming people you'll ever meet. Enjoy, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good the portions a gave you are great if you want a Down south barbecue feel you need reason will price come here I get to you'll be back"}
{"text":"Small place but very nice, food was excellent! Cheap and delicious!! I got combo with 3 meat and 2 side only $17. Most price friendly BBQ place I ever visited."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great place. A bit hard to find as it is in a residential area but worth the hunt!  Top notch authentic barbeque. Portions are large, even with a combination plate.   We tried pretty much everything between the two plates and could not finish."}
{"text":"The food at this location was decent but deafly not the best that my family and I have had we came on a Sunday because the other location was closed and I won't be returning to this site but definitely will be going to the other location to try their food as I think it will be much fresher"}
{"text":"While staying in North Las Vegas, we searched Yelp for the closest BBQ place and we found John Muir's Meats and Road Kill Grill. 

As we followed the directions on Google Maps, it lead us towards the mountains to the Clark County Shooting Complex. First I thought, Google maps lead us to the wrong location. But it was right, the restaurant was hidden inside the shooting complex. 

The restaurant wasn't much, just a small counter surrounded by a dining area. There were only two guys took the orders and prepared the food. 

We ordered the Brisket sandwich and the rib teaser. The brisket sandwich had a generous amount of brisket and it was very tender. The same can be said about the ribs. Both were delicious and it exceeded my expectations. I thought the BBQ would be mediocre but it was some great tasting BBQ. 

The restaurant is definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love purchasing our meats here. Their bbq is delicious too!!! This is our go to place to buy meat or chicken. The staff is all friendly and outgoing. I love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent meat market. The ham steak was delightful. BBQ is good. Pulled pork outstanding.  Great brisket.   Pass on the ribs and Cole slaw. Very good size portions."}
{"text":"Had the chili cheese fries as a snack while TJ and my wife had chicken wings, fries, mac n' cheese and ribs. Cheese fries were pretty good and TJ liked the wings a lot. Looked pretty good. Good spot to put a small grill at the shooting range because will get hungry and instead leaving the area, they can get food right on the premises."}
{"text":"The BBQ is AMAZING. The staff is always so nice and friendly, always greeting you. Chuck always has a smile on his face and you can see he has a passion for what he does. Won't go anywhere else for my bbq or butchering."}
{"text":"Just love the breakfast here. That is why I keep coming back. What more can I say?!
Yelp won't post this unless I write more? Yelp.. Did you notice I said what more can I say? Sheesh!
 I mean how many ways can I say I like the breakfast?"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Vegas and have been coming here for years. My uncles used them back in the 60's for their deer. and it is still around and family owned. They have picnic tables if you want to eat there. 
They will have a wait if you go at dinner time, but it is SO worth the wait. The brisket is amazing and I love the Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens."}
{"text":"First things first Google Maps and the like take you to Costco, which is wrong. Costco is the 6800 block and this place is the 11000 block. Continue driving north on Decatur until you get to the shooting range and then follow the signs towards the shooting center. Road Kill Grill is inside there. 

PSA They do not have the full menu that they do at the other location. This was likely a cafeteria for shooters to get snacks and stuff they decided to open up a delicious bbq spot here, but why? The location sucks and the lady said they are usually slow in the summer because no one wants to go shooting in a billion degree weather. This location has a small bbq menu and a few other non-bbq items like corn dogs, quesadillas and chili cheese fries. There is also a vending machines with frozen burritos, ice cream, drinks and snacks. 

We both ordered the 3 meat combo for $17.95, which includes 3 meats and 2 sides. I chose pulled pork, brisket and hot links with mac n cheese and fries. My bf got ribs x2, and brisket with mac n cheese and beans. We also got bottled water $1, and Gatorade $2. 

Our food came out fairly quickly which is great cuz we were hungry! The 3 meat combo was huge and definitely enough to make 2/3 meals. The fries were hot and crispy and they had ranch and fry sauce for dipping which were both house made and delicous. The beans were really good. They had a smoky flavor and a bit of a bite to them. My favorite side was the Mac and cheese. It was so cheesy and delicous. It was like if you look up comfort food in the dictionary, this mac n cheese would be there. So good. 

All of the meats came unsauced and they provided regular and hot bbq sauce on the side. The pulled pork is always my fav but this one was very salty. I really liked the hot link which wasn't very hot, and you get two of them. The ribs were St. Louis and had a nice smoky flavor, but they were kind of dry and not super hot. They weren't fall off the bone and had a bit of a chew to them, I wonder if they were cooked a few days before? Still good but not my fav. The sauce helped a bit! I enjoyed the brisket the best, it was tender and needed no sauce. 

The service was friendly and the food was good, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to make the trek to this place again."}
{"text":"If you need to cater a party or event this is your place! The prices are great and the food is to die for!!! I went to a wedding catered by John Mulls and people were going back for 2nds and 3rds! My mouth waters thinking about their mac n cheese and pulled pork... oh and the baked beans are unreal. Go for lunch, dinner or schedule an event, just go!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Slow service. The guy behind the counter said, \"I'll be right with you buddy,\" and went back to whatever he was doing. Seemed out of it. I waited, waited, waited.... a few people bought sodas by dropping there dollars on the counter, he said thanks, looked at me.... waited, waited, waited. And then I left. Im sure the food is great but if it takes that long to order how long would it be before I got my order? I use Mulls to butcher game animals they're good people but you need to have nothing to do all afternoon to eat here.  I was there on 3/3/16 at 1300 hours."}
{"text":"Tried the pulled chicken sandwich, fries and mac n cheese. I wanted coleslaw but they ran out. The sandwich was huge and tasted so good. The fries were well, fries. The were good nothing special, but I didn't expect much from fries. I was sad I couldn't try coleslaw, hopefully next time. The mac n cheese just didn't do it for me. I have heard amazing things from it but I wasn't that impressed. Maybe it's because by the time I was able to eat my food it had started to eat cold. I'm not sure. But the sandwich was amazing and I had a bite of the hot link which was amazing too."}
{"text":"Located inside the Clark County Shooting Complex you will find this hidden gem! Road Kill Grill (featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives) has opened a second location. We went up to check out their breakfast menu. This is a no frills, picnic style, counter service, very affordable, AMAZING FOOD, place to eat. The portions are large and it was served up fast by very friendly staff. Two of us ate this amazing food for a total of 15.00 plus a few bucks in a tip jar for the great service. Breakfast is served Friday-Sunday 8-11. Note the Decatur location is closed Mondays and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in town, everything was good and affordable.. definitely will comeback for more, worth the drive and  it's clean.."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here. If it's the prepared food or the butcher shop. Absolutely excellent food and cuts of meat. Remember to Support small business."}
{"text":"Ok this place is good. But they have a young man in there that serve that need a personality ck need to be more personal when working with the public. Holidays they need to be more organized Thanksgiving I was in line for two and a half hours to get a pre order Turkey.  Need to find a another system cause the one they have isn't working. But over all the food is good but I make the best homemade potato salad  I'm just saying"}
{"text":"Saw Guy Fieri's episode about John Mull's meat place. So while we were in Vegas we decide to check this place out. Upon driving in the first thing we noticed is it literally is in a neighborhood. Homes all around. My husband said \"I don't know about this. This can't be right. Well it is right. It's a big place meaning the land the BBQ joint SIT ON. I say this because when you walk in to order your food, that is all the space the inside has. About 10 people can fit inside. Stand in line, order your food, pay for your food then walk out and turn left and left again to a shaded are to eat your food. The food is very tasty. I had the combo of pulled chicken and rib tips my two sides were green beans and collard greens with a side of Mac and cheese. It also came with a corn bread cake. It's was as Guy would said on point. Very favorable. We also met a great family who was visiting from North Carolina who was visiting the area and checking it out because of the Diners Drive in and Dives. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was 100 degree out and sitting in the heat with the dry winds was a little uncomfortable. With that said, both my husband and I said we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Greatest BBQ in Vegas. I have been there many times with friends and family and it has always been wonderful. The BBQ is not that Lucille's heavy smokey flavor that I don't like. The sauce is perfect for me sweet with just the correct amount of spice and heat. This was the best kept secret in Vegas although now everyone should enjoy. Visit the Thom location it is very old school and you may see some rabbits in the dirt parking lot, heels are not appropriate especially if it's raining. You can have your Deer or Elk processed there so don't call your significant other dear.  Love this place I wish they were open later and had inside seating.  Andrew JF"}
{"text":"The best smoked tasty bbq in town.   Had to work late on the holiday and they closing. The young nice gentleman hooked me up with tips, sliced beef sausages greens and things . Thank you for keeping it  real, real good. Will come back for seconds, and thirds and fourths and so on and so on. Stay tight and keep it right. God bless ya'll and see you soon."}
{"text":"By fat best BBQ I have ever had! Ribs cooked to perfection, Brisket was the best cut it with a fork so full of flavor! And we tried the pulled BBQ chicken did not expect to be blown away wow so good. Awesome cornbread green beans like Grandma used to make! Can't say enough good about this place. Be prepared to wait in line 1 - 1 1/2 hours in line but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch on our 2 year anniversary trip. The food was great.  The meats didn't even need bbq sauce.  The scenery was great along with friendly staff. Thank you guys for the great food and service"}
{"text":"First time here ordered a brisket sandwich with coleslaw on the side very good very filling not bad pricing what so ever place was empty when we arrived kinda weird but the food was pretty good"}
{"text":"This is the best bbq I've had in Vegas, and the service is top notch. I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 meat combo with baked beans, Mac n cheese I also got a side of the coleslaw. No potato salad available. Brisket-tough & too much fat & cold
Ribs-would have been really good if they were warm and not cold, Pulled Pork-awesome and hot
Mac N Cheese-old and cold, probably would have been really good if it was hot. Coleslaw mushy and the baked beans were the best part! Oh and cold corn bread. I will try the original location but I will never got back to this location."}
{"text":"We saw the Road Kill Grill on Triple D a few years ago but just never had the time to get there when visiting Las Vegas. They have the best brisket we ever had! It was worth the drive from the strip. Ribs, pulled chicken and pulled pork are also excellent. You get a huge meal for a very fair price. Next trip to Vegas...you'll find us there again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place and now I have found this location.  It is smaller than the original but food is just as awesome and the service just as friendly."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the location of this place.  It's like eating at a neighborhood block party.  There's no alcohol here but I'm sure you can sneak some in a small cooler and an inconspicuous cup.  I've had a variety of meats and this place has not disappointed.  A MUST for BBQ!!!  Sides are all good too.  Don't hesitate!  Just go and see for yourself :)"}
{"text":"We cane here thinking it was like the other one and we can buy meat but we were so wrong lol.  But we ate and the food was pretty good.  The fish was fried nicely not too fishy, ribs were tender and didn't fall off the bone, tender brisket, baked beans were just the right amount of sweet. Overall oil must say we enjoyed it.  The bathroom was clean.  It's in a weird location but hey it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"By far some of the best BBQ I ever had. The staff is always real friendly too. The only reason I didn't give the 5 stars is for the fact that you have to wait in a line outside for your order. We waited about a hour our last visit. In the summertime the n can be a little brutal."}
{"text":"My experience at John Mull's was based on Thanksgiving. I had my turkey smoked by John's Mull. Here is a warning: if you are ordering your turkey you WILL have to wait in line to pick it up. How long do you ask? An hour..that's right! My recommendation is to get there EARLY! When I say early I mean 8:15am the day of pick-up. Trust me...I showed up at 8:10 and people were already in line. Ok ok you want to know if the meat is good...uhhh yah! The meat is tender, moist and full of flavor. My entire family gobbled up that turkey like it was nobody's business! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Just want to write a review to a place that deserves it. Every time I come here the food is always exceptional with the customer service to match. The food taste great, & the atmosphere is awesome. I love coming here even when I don't shoot whenever I'm in the area I just have to grab a bite. Thanks for having this place here I wish there were more in town!"}
{"text":"Good collard greens lots of food. Brisket was moist and juicy.  My partner liked his chicken and he's fussy on smoked chicken. 

Not overwhelmed as previously described it is busy and unorganized. Today the credit card machine wasn't working right. 

There was not much of a line when we arrived   It took nearly 25 minutes to get our food. Since it is cafeteria style the hold up was the credit card machine.  
I would give it another try and split my meal. I don't live in Vegas so it will be a while. 

Reasonable even cheap pricing. A true dive which is always an experience."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and sides. Large portions and good prices. Be prepared to wait in line if you go during lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after shooting with my parents on my birthday. 
I was shocked, because I had NO idea that there was a second location, here at the range. 
I've been wanting to try the original Road Kill Grill for a minute, so I was thrilled when mom and dad offered to buy me lunch. 

We tried: 
The Brisket sandwich
Pulled Pork tacos
Mac n cheese.

The Brisket was amazing.  It actually heated up pretty well, as I took half home to my husband.  The meat was tender and flavorful, even without the great BBQ sauce that they provided.  Loved this.  Will DEFINITELY have it again.

Pulled Pork tacos:  Have I mentioned that I'm not a pork fan?  I swear I never used to be.  Sometimes I still get squicked out ordering or eating it, but these tacos were the BUSINESS.  So good.  Tender meat, shredded to perfection.  Cheese.  A mystery sauce (I think maybe a cilantro creme?).  Onion.  My only wish was that the corn tortillas were a little more cooked.  They seemed under done/raw-ish to me.  But they were still delicious.   I begrudgingly shared one with my dad (since there were 3 street tacos), and he agreed.  Delightful.  

The mac n cheese:  I liked it.  It could have been creamier, and the noodles were mushy soft...but I like it that way.  My husband wouldn't have enjoyed it, but he can write a review if he tries it.  I liked it a lot.  Really good, and you can tell its homemade and not boxed. 

All in all, this was a great visit, and I cannot WAIT to go back again."}
{"text":"Shooting tournament over the weekend at the Clark County Shooting Complex.  In the club house/office is the Road Kill Grill II.  We tried the grilled cheese, cheeseburger, chicken wrap, chicken nachos, all beef hot dog and peach cobbler.  Food was very good, priced well and we LOVED Selita who worked the counter.  (I hope I spelled your name correctly)  She was friendly, always smiling and remembered our grandson's name (probably because he ate a lot there).  No matter.....good food, great service.....hope we have another shoot there soon.  Want to try some of the other items on the menu.  Wish I could post the pic of Tyler with Selita....."}
{"text":"Keep hearing about this place as the best BBQ in Vegas...I can agree however it is by far not the best BBQ i've had.

I ordered the three meat combo and got:

Hot Links - Pretty Good and nice flavor

Rib Tips - Pretty good and even better if left in the sauce overnight...

Briskit - A little dry but decent flavor...Their sauce is muy fuego...the spicy isn't spicy but its so damn good. I'm a fan of not putting condiments or adding extra shit to food that has been prepared for you because I believe it should be good the way it is. However this sauce with that little dry briskit made it good.

Mac & Cheese - You can't fuck up mac & cheese and if you do you need to stop cooking...so yes of course this was good and you can tell they used real cheese instead of that powdered or liquid form.

Green Beans - Ehhh yah it reminded me of them frozen green beans maybe cause its soaked in some broth but yah I should have gotten their greens...

Cornbread - who doesnt love cornbread and bbq...

Honestly I eat a fuckin lot and I couldn't finish the 3-meat combo (pause)...they give you so much good food for your buck that it is worth it. Plus the way all the hard work, passion and dedication is resonated in the food how can you not love this shit. Good Merican BBQ at it's finest."}
{"text":"Just like John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill #1, this location is beaming with hospitality and customer care. Although this location is a little hidden from the main road, this restaurant serves delicious bbq-style platters for a very reasonable price! Once again, their customer service is above and beyond your typical restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed after driving out here because we heard it was on Diners Drive ins and Dives. My husband is from southern VA and is a BBQ fanatic (Carolina style mostly). We got the pulled pork and chicken sandwiches thought they tasted like \"BBQ\" you can make at home by putting meat and sauce in a crockpot. The bread was great. As was the macaroni and cheese and French fries we got for sides. Decent meal, we just thought the meat would be smoked to perfection and that was not the case"}
{"text":"Genius idea to put their second location inside the Clark county shooting complex!  Pretty much guaranteed business since there is NOTHING else out there.  With that said their ribs are legit and I would travel to try them out...but the good news is they are just minutes from Aliante!  This location looks like a normal grill at any sporting complex.  Small and dinky looking...but plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  The menu is a lot smaller than their original location, but has the goodies like ribs, pulled pork, brisket sandwich, hot links.  They also serve breakfast on the weekends.  For $9 I got the four rib teaser (which surprisingly came with 5 ribs) and one side.  The ribs were nice and tender and the mild BBQ sauce was the perfect combo of sweet, smoky, and spicy for me.  The Mac and cheese was good, but not the best I've had.  My husband had the hot link sandwich...came with two hot links and a side.  The French fries were really crispy, just the way I like and we enjoyed their fry sauce.  This will be our BBQ spot up north...we have yet to try their original location...but it's on the list since the menu is bigger there!"}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like shit this is the place to go.  Patricia mentioned a young man.  I had misfortune of ordering from a woman,  so it's not just one rogue employee. I'm pretty tolerant of bad service but I can't recall ever having such hostile service. 
How's the food?  I don't know. Maybe I was just so angry that when the food eventually came I couldn't enjoy it.  And I did not enjoy it and neither did my friend. 

The fries had nice seasoning but I didn't like the them.  The chicken nuggets were like McDonald's but fried longer.  The brisket was passable but had a lot of extra fat I had to pull off.  It wasn't as tender as I would expect.  The BBQ sauce was good.  We didn't like the coleslaw either.  It seemed a little mushy for my taste.  The soda was room temperature.

While I'm not expecting food poisoning I'm going to give my first one star review for a restaurant."}
{"text":"The closest restaurant to my house is this place!  It's in the shotgun center at the gun club.  Basically a cafeteria.

It has a limited menu, sandwiches only.  No collards... Boooooo.  I had the brisket sandwich.  It was tender, flavor just ok, but the flavorful sauce fixed right up.  

Not worth the drive because of the limited menu, but better than waiting online for 2 hours at their other place.

Great views up here."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Trey is a great asset to this company, he is Professional, polite, Caring of his customers. Jose is the best cook ever. I love his pico de gallo. Everything is freshly made. Both these guys are a great asset. Everything has a phenomenal taste to it. Great job Trey and Jose."}
{"text":"I can't remember when I was here last but god damn is it AMAZING!!!!!!!!!

I can't remember what I got, but it's one of the best. Every time I took a bite after the first one, I drooled and gleeked because I was in heaven. 

\"Gleeked\"  the act of taste buds mortaring the food about to enter your cake-hole. 

Anyway, I wish they had a spicy honey mustard or something to go with the BBQ. You can even bring your kill to their butcher shop! How convenient! I wonder if the butcher requests a cut of your kill. If so, by all means! Great place, John!"}
{"text":"I want to live here. Just kidding, but really.. the food here is DELICIOUS & the service was amazing. Everyone makes you feel right at home. Being able to eat smoked bbq outside on picnic tables with my family like we did when I was growing up was an awesome experience I won't forget. We drove over 40 minutes to bring our family here for this food & we'll be doing it again very soon!"}
