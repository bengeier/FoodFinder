{"text":"Wasn't very pleased with the lights flickering on and off when I first walked in to the restaurant. Second of all , it took over 40 minutes for my food to arrive. My mistake I was out with my family of 5 and it took well over 40 minutes to get a typical family dinner ready. The staff was very nice don't get me wrong. I just wouldn't recommend going here with family"}
{"text":"If you want to get a lot of food for a reasonable price this is the place to go. With an assortment of food options from burgers, to Italian, to seafood every meal comes with a soup AND salad. I personally love this especially when I am starving. I always go to de la place for their pizza-ghetti! It is my favorite! The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because I feel like they could be a little more clean. Definitely getting rid of the bar flies would be a good start."}

     The other option for quality pizza if you live in the shitberg of chateauguay  is restaurant De La Place.

     A restaurant that the 55 plus club frequents and with a menu of over 100 dishes, this is the local restaurant that stays open because there is nowhere else to go and the same customer have been coming on the same nights for 50 years...but the pie is good, second best in town...
