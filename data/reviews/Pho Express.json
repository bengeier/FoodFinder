{"text":"Awesome Pho! Definitely the best I've found in the city so far, friendly staff who remember us every time and what we order. Satay Beef Noodle Soup is 100% - and they have dippy cups which is apparently hard to find in viet restaurants nowadays."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a fan of Pho Express. I first started coming here when I used to work in this mall. As soon as I found out a Vietnamese place was opening, I knew I had to give it a try (I LOVE Vietnamese food). 

I have never had a bad experience here. The owners are super friendly, and always remember me when I come in. Even though I haven't worked in the area in two years, they still know my name and ask how I'm doing. Customer service like that really doesn't exist much anymore, so it's really nice when you have an experience like that. I have tried a variety of things on their menu. Their veggie spring rolls are always a good choice, and I like that they have their hot sauce at the table as that is what I dip my spring rolls in (yep, living on the wild side :P). I love their salad rolls as well. Now I will admit that I'm picky when it comes to salad rolls. Often the rice paper soaks for too long, and the rolls rip the minute you pick it up. Such a pet peeve when that happens, and luckily I've always had salad rolls that don't fall apart here.

I often get either their Spicy Beef Pho or Beef Satay Sub for an entree. The sub is always delicious. The bread to filling ratio is pretty good (often I've encountered subs where the bread is huge and there's hardly any filling). The portion size is quite generous also. I'm always full for several hours after one of their subs. Their Pho is perfect on a cold day. Big portion, good amount of spice, and lots of meat and noodles. I like that their noodles aren't a big clump. That can be an issue with Pho I find, and I like that I've never had that happen here.

Overall, their decor isn't the prettiest. But they are fast and the food is always delicious. Check them out!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been trying all of the Vietnamese food in the area trying to find our favourite (we LOVE Vietnamese), and we found it in Pho Express. The owners are super friendly and they always remember me when I come in (even after only the first couple times). The customer service is absolutely the best I've encountered, and the food is too. The business is family owned and run with the women making the food, and the men serving the customers. I can be a bit critical of spring rolls, but theirs' are absolutely perfect. All of the dishes portion sizes are very generous, and they always fill me up for hours (if I can't finish, it's still two full meals). If you're getting take-out it's extremely fast (~10 minutes), even at busy times.

Pho Express is so good that now we don't even consider going back to other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast, well priced and super friendly staff. Our go to pho place in the area. It's another hidden gem in Glenmorgan."}
{"text":"Quick service and inexpensive but tasty pho.  The daily lunch specials are a good value at around $5."}
{"text":"My family loves it hear. We go every Friday and get the soup. My kids call it Pho Phriday."}
{"text":"Pho Express is my go-to Pho restaurant. I started going there as it was close to where I used to live. I don't live that close anymore, but I still go there as much as I can. The broth and noodles are delicious, and it always come with a good amount of meat (I always get the rare beef pho). Definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered #14, the grilled pork chop with vegetables on rice or noodle.
Some strange things now that I look back:

1. the menu says rice OR noodle, but they didn't ask me which one I wanted and just gave me rice.

2. the menu also says $5.49, but they charged $6.49. Tax included. I chose not to say anything because most of the other items were $6.49 to give them the benefit of the doubt that they just forgot to update the menu.

Cashier asked me whether I wanted a fork or a pair of disposable chopsticks. I guess they didn't want to give supplies out if I wasn't going to use it.

The pork chops are grilled when the order is made, so you'll have to wait a few minutes for it. 
They sort of just left me standing there without any additional instructions while they continued to service other cashiers, and a minute later only mentioned that I will need to wait a bit longer for the food. I could see what was going in the kitchen so it wasn't a surprise, but I can imagine some people might be turned off if the cashier takes their money, but then proceeds to serve other people.

Portion sizes are pretty small. They don't really fill the box, and there's only a few pieces of vegetables. Taste is just alright.

Their pho bowls are better."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! 

Fast-food/court, inexpensive, generous portions and fresh tasty ingredients.  The staff are really friendly compare to my previous Asian fast food vendor experiences. I paid $6.50 incl. tx.  I was stuffed halfway through.  And they were quite generous with the shrimp too! I didn't give it a 5 cause of the place/mall,  it's dark and run down looking. If in the area, check it out!  I will in the near future! :-) 
Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Pho Express is located in the village by the grange food court adjacent to OCAD University. 

I had lunch here a few times; I think their food is tasty enough but not very authentic. Their pho broth lacks the flavour that other Viet joints have. Price is very reasonable and staff is nice.

Still I like eating here and am almost jealous that OCAD students have this dining option whenever they feel like on campus :)

Debit/credit charge: $0.25"}
{"text":"I was driving around the area looking for a Vietnamese Pho restaurant as the usual place I go to was closed on Monday. I stumbled upon Pho Express.  There was ample parking and the inside of the restaurant was clean. I ordered the pho with beef slices and, while the portion was generous, the soup base was not good. It lacked any depth of flavour and tasted like the quality of pho I would get at a food court. I also ordered spring rolls and salad rolls. The spring rolls were tiny. Teeny tiny.  The smallest I've ever seen but still good. The salad rolls were okay - it had shrimp but no pork and the dipping sauce left a lot to be desired.

I would not recommend this restaurant if you're looking for delicious homestyle pho."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and friendly staff. Would like slightly larger portions but always happy when I order from here."}
{"text":"I do eat here semi often as it's close to home. It's really just a cheap food option when we don't feel like cooking.

Like most Vietnamese restaurants, there are a lot of options that are really just a choice of meat on vermicelli noodles or rice. The staff, which must be a family business, are all polite and the service is quick. 

It's a bit run down and sometimes there's no one else eating here besides us. So it's usually quiet."}
{"text":"First time here. The restaurant is dated & very shabby looking but the food definitely makes up for it. Had the Satay Steak Rice Noodle Soup & it was absolutely delicious! Broth was very flavourful. Not too spicy, just enough of a little kick to it. Spring rolls were hot as they were just cooked fresh but wasn't too crazy about the taste of them. I will come back here if I'm in Calgary again. Definitely would recommend this place. Service was good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last year and my latest experience has left me cold. I order #24 and my complaints are: the vermicelli noodles are cut up in little pieces, the spring roll that appears on top was tasteless and appears to have been left to soak in oil, there is a shortage of peanuts on top and I'm assuming it was only lemongrass infused not made with lemongrass. I am so disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Had the food delivered to me at work. All the sauce was dripping from the Styrofoam container into the bag. Had to spend 10 minutes of my 30 minute lunch break cleaning up sticky sauce off the counters and containers. Not great. Will not order delivery from them again."}
{"text":"I came here regularly for lunch when I worked in the area, and it's okay. But I can't imagine that I'll ever go out of my way to get back here, so I thought I should cut it back a star (as it's really rather average at best).

Good service though, and nice people."}
