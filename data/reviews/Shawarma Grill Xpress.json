{"text":"I come here once and a while when I don't want a burrito from Fat Bastards, in the past three four years that I have been coming I always recieved cold meat. It is a health regulation for shawarma places to warm up the chicken on the grill or pan since the rotator does not get it up to proper serving temperatures. Every single time I want to give them another chance I'm left disappointed from the coldness of whatever I've ordered. I really hope they change that and up there standards since everything else is quite good."}
{"text":"Ordered uber eats from here twice. The first time the chicken shwarma platter was good. Came nicely packed in a black plastic container with a side of pita. Today was another story. The chicken was chewy and full of fat. Once I opened the white styrofoam container it looked like a horrible mess. Meat, rice and potatoes all mixed up like a sir fry. No pita, hardly any veggies. Way too much sauce just thrown all over. Don't think I'd give this place a third try."}
{"text":"The food is Halal and its not that bad as they do make there own sauces. There is plenty of space to sit down and eat. As its part of the a strip mall there is plenty of parking as well.   I have had the chicken Shawarama plate twice here and the meat is cooked properly and the potatoes are nice but that's where they cut.    All in All its not to bad and not too great. If you are in the neighborhood and feel like Shawarma, this place is there to go and get it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero,  I would.  Had the worst experience and food in the gta from this place.  McDonalds feels like a 5 star restaurant when compared to here.  We had beef shish kabab sandwich. The meat seemed stale, and really tough to chew, the employee were serving clients after us, first and forgot about us, got our quantities incorrect. Overall, not sure if this is a rare occurrence, but this is definitely our first time and our last time. We ended up throwing out the food."}
{"text":"Meat is often overspiced, dry and salty. They are also skimpy with the sides, especially fries. It's not a bad shwarma perse, but not very authentic or satisfying for the price."}
{"text":"Shawarma fanatic here. I've eaten my fair share of shawarma and this place is one of the best places I've eaten, so far.   The space is small but clean and staffs are professional. They have many side dishes like potatoes and samosas. They also give u pita bread too! :)  All the items combined are so flavourful, my mouth water for it after a night of partying. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the mixed shawarma on a pita.  They didn't give me any of the chicken and all the meat was burnt and taken from the bottom  drippings (they didn't shave any off) plus they burnt the pita when it was grilled.  Not a good experience, though my husband thought his falalfel sandwich was good ( I suggested not to have them toast the pita).  We had to race to a meeting so I didn't asked for a replacement but I saved the burnt bits to show the counter staff.  There is very limited parking here."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma here is excellent. The ingredients all taste fresh, with lots of flavour.  Everything else available here looks great too. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I went on a week day just before lunch time so there was no customers there. It looked like mom was the cook and son was the server.   I order a chicken shawarma plate to go with rice and tabbouleh for the 2 sides. When I told the \"mom\"  I like lentil rice, she gave me a big helping which I appreciated and a generous portion of chicken as well. But when it comes to tabbouleh, it was a little pre-packed box that has no more than 2 tablespoons. I was so disappointed as I love tabbouleh! Most places, they give you an equal portion of everything which I would rather have than just rice and meat with no greens! Anyway, the total comes to $13.55 without a drink! A little on the expansive side!  The food after all taste good and deserve another half star ( 3 1/2 in total). I may go back again next time and see whether I can negotiate for more tabbouleh and less meat and rice!!"}
{"text":"Well cooked meat, Generous portion And best of all their grills are delicious.  For grills, it is better to order over the phone since they  grill each order separately  It is probably the cleanest Shawarma place ever."}
{"text":"Service is consistently SLOOOOOOOW.   Different staff members every time I've been there (3-4 times now).    Falafels are delicious, but the service is so dodgy that I think I'm done trying...   Also, my brother had a Chicken Shawarma, and had quite a few tiny little bones in his meal.  Very nervewracking, since you don't expect to have to watch out for bones in shawarma.  Would be a nice option for fast food in the area if you could rely on it, especially with it's proximity to the movie theatre.  But you just can't rely on it."}
{"text":"I ADORE this place. I am a bit of a shawarma connoisseur.. Mostly since Shawarma is my favourite food. I grew up in a Lebanese family so i know the difference between the yummy homemade stuff and the industrialized \"feed the crowd\" food. Shawarma Grill Xpress is defiantly homemade quality good! The ingredients they use look fresh hand picked and healthy. The space is beautiful and always kept clean the food is exquisite and the service is amazing. As a feminist let me say that this is the one shawarma place that treats you with respect without catcalling you, like other joints (*caugh.. Caugh villa madina*) Over all service is incredible. Food tastes amazing. Quality is amazing. The place is clean and beautiful! And they are OPEN FROM 11am-11pm  Weekdays and 11am-9pm weekends"}
{"text":"We dropped in late Thursday night.  Ordered their chicken shawarma dinner and the missys ordered a veggie dish.  Both were very good and the portions were generous. The guys serving us were a bit of a comedy act but in a good way.  Maybe a bit over-priced for a strip mall eatery but the food is definitely very good."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant, for some time now and the people I work with, have as well because I recommended them to this place.  Today was a very big disappointment!  First of all the owner and employee were too busy talking, I had to interrupt them to place my order and they still continued to talk while I was paying.  Then they put my sandwich together, with the chicken sitting around for who knows how long, instead of cutting fresh!! To top it off, they give it to me cold and the chicken was all dried out and hard! Not Happy and not sure if I will go back....too bad, i really liked this place..."}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh each day - no stale, soggy veggies here!  I always get a plate and ALWAYS get the stewed veggies as one side (garlic, tomato, and eggplant magic).  Potions are generous, the staff is friendly and the place is very clean. I go here often and have always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went here a while ago.. definitely overprices for what you get. Portions are not generous and the meat is dry and too much fat on it. I ordered a dinner plate type chicken shawarma and it did not even come with hummus. They charged me extra for that.  If you are looking for mall food court type shawarma then this might be okay, but there are plenty of better places around for the same if not lower price.  For anyone who wants real shawarma try going to Paramount.  Bottom line, that was my first and last time there. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I fucking love this place. Hands down my favourite shawarma dinner. The chicken is always tender and has a great sear on it. I always pair it with their brown rice and lentil side and the roasted garlic eggplant. Absolutley love it here."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto over the weekend and decided to stop at Shawarma Xpress.  I had  Beef Shawarma and Chicken Shawarma sandwiches.  It was one of the best Shawarma sandwiches I've had.  Excellent staff and quick, great prices, and I enjoyed the sit-down.  I will definitely go there in my next trip to Toronto, and I totally recommend it.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"As a newcomer on the Mimico scene, I just tried this place for the first time, and I am one happy little piggy.   The lovely woman in charge is from Lebanon, and man, she is a great cook. She makes everything herself from scratch each day, and makes just enough for the day, so go early if you like lentil soup, because it sells out.   Very clean & bright, it's a pleasant little place, but it's really more of a take out joint, with high top tables and chairs that don't invite you to linger.   I had the falafel plate, and it was a huge mound of delicious flavour delights. The falafel is made from scratch; she hand grinds the chickpea, onion, etc, to make these crispy, tasty balls of protein. I had mine with seasoned rice & lentils topped with caramelized onion, and char grilled vegetables. And hummus and pickles and all the other little extra goodies. I declined the pita and still couldn't finish it. Not even close.   My mom also lost her mind over this food, so that's 4 enthusiastic thumbs up.   So. To recap. Wonderful, fresh, flavourful & healthy vegan food in mass quantities.   Nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"I visited Shawarma Grill Xpress for the first time yesterday (Friday night) after seeing how close to home it was. They were very quick to take my order and money, but took close to a good half hour to even put my order together. Reason for this is because they were serving their regulars first instead of going in the order the orders were placed. There was a young couple in front of me who had been waiting for their order for well OVER a half hour when they finally decided to leave and wanted their money back. The gentlemen behind the counter said that they cannot do debit/credit returns. This was my first time visiting this place and after what I saw/experienced, I can be rest-assured that this will be my last. Even Shawarma places downtown that are twice as busy seem to have more prompt and reliable service. I would suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. More of a take put place with limited seating inside. The plate dinner is a good portion as you get 2 sides on top of the meat.  They have daily specials such as sandwiches with pop for a decent amount.  Nothing to write home about, maybe I should have went to the Burrito boyz next door."}
{"text":"This Shawarma joint gets an A for effort, but doesn't quite satisfy like a family style restaurant specializing in this middle east cuisine. I had the chicken shawarma on a plate and it was fine just not as good as it could be. The chicken tasted good but had a few chunks that should have been cut off before cooking. The sides were amazing though - the grilled veggies were excellent. I asked for hot sauce on the plate and the guy covered everything with sauce which was fine, but I could have done without it on the salad part, that was not expected. I'll go back and try the sandwich shawarma sometime next time I need a fix. Worth a look if you're heading down the Queensway and get the urge for spice and garlic, yummy!"}
{"text":"I may have had better chicken shawarmas over my years but this joint still definitely hit the spot, I scarfed down that sucker like nobodies business. Juicy chicken, crunchy tangy pickled elements, soft chewy wrap, and tasty sauces. Only possible complaint? The distribution of ingredients within the wrap was slightly off, but that's bound to happen with just about any wrapped food. The place itself was nice as well, and the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick dinner tonight, and ordered 2 chicken schwarma pitas and 2 side of fries to go. I had to wait 20 minutes for my order to be complete, and there was only 1 order before mine. On top of that, we got home to find the fries were completely uncooked and soggy. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with fries and it was pretty good. The portion was large enough to completely satisfy. Chicken was well seasoned and veggies fresh. Just wish the sauces were a bit stronger or more flavourful to amp up the taste of the wrap. Love that they are open late too! Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"One of my favourites in the city! Fast, delicious, and great portion size! The staff are always so kind and friendly :) I always bring friends here and they get equally addicted as I am."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered two plates - mixed shawarma plate and minced beef kebab (kefta). The shawarma meat was some of the best I've had across Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. You can choose your own sides - salad, grilled veg, rice, potatoes, etc - which is almost unheard of at a flat price. The minced beef kebab was made fresh to order.   There are many wow factors; 1) well seasoned meat [by far the best I've had; they don't rely on sauces to flavour your meal (even though they have great ones)]!  2) sides were delicious, fresh and generous 3) the price is very reasonable as you get an unusually large portion - I could only eat 1/3rd in one sitting 4) it's family run and offers warm, friendly service   I didn't try the garlic potatoes but, damn, they looked amazing and the table next to us was raving about them.   Come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The shawarma meat is really amazing. Friendly service, tasty, but slightly confusing menu. Their shawarma plates are $11.99 which I find slightly expensive for a fast food place. You get to choose 2 sides with hummus being included on the list to choose from (thought this would come standard with any shawarma dish). My go-to is the chicken shawarma pita which is priced at a very reasonable $5.99 and makes for a very satisfying meal. I'd recommend if you are in the area but you better be a good driver if you're going to park in the lot out front:)"}
{"text":"Since this is pretty much right beside my place, you can say I go here often. Large portions, great staff and unreal hot sauce. Make sure to get Garlic, Hummus, Tzatziki sauce and hot sauce on your plate (sounds weird but amazing). Also, avoid going right before they close because your food will be cold, saying from experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap on my way home, as I lacked the self-control to wait to eat until I reached home.  Fortunately, even after 10pm, the chicken was still cut off the spit to order, and not simply taken out of a warming tray. The sauces were tasty and even the hot sauce had a distinct flavour to it, though not actually being that spicy.  For some reason, the way they stuff the pita meant that many bites were veggie only, whereas other bites were mostly meat. It might sound a bit picky, but it did sort've take away from the enjoyment. They also grill it once wrapped if you want. The grill must've been absolutely scorching, as the pita had deep grill marks barely a few seconds on it. The problem with that is that it didn't really heat anything inside.  Not too bad, and credit to them for serving a fairly fresh wrap even that late in the day."}
{"text":"Craving for a classic shawarma plate? Shawarma Grill xpress isn't too shabby. Located right in the plaza with the busy burrito boyz, shawarma grill xpress is often forgotten. Went in on a rainy night and decided to try their chicken shawarma plate. The plate itself is huge.. you get to choose 2 sides, salad and your chicken. I opted for the potatos and rice. Rice was flavourful and good and the potatoes were also good but not crispy enough! The chicken shawarma is very flavourful and tasty and you see them cut it directly off the spit. Ask for the garlic sauce because it is very tasty! The only down side is the last time i was there, the potato and rice were only warm and not hot hot so it makes you think if it has been sitting out for long.  Overall, whenever i do get a shawarma craving, I will be stopping by here. Family own as well I believe. The mother is super friendly and super nice. Be hungry if you decide to choose teir shawarma plate!"}
{"text":"We had passed by this place a couple times going to and from the Queensway Cineplex cinemas and finally decided to try it out.  It's right next to a Burrito Boyz on the south side of Queensway just west of the cinemas.  It's a cafeteria style place so you basically just order and let them know what you want and they call you up when it is ready.  I had ordered a mixed combo plate, my brother ordered a beef shawarma plate and my wife ordered a falafel pita.  The pita I think was 5 dollars and the combo plates were 12 and 13 bucks respectively.    The first thing I thought is that it's a few bucks more than say Villa Madina but I was interested to see how their food was.  Our choices were basically rice, rice with lentils and potatoes to add to our plates.  They don't really have salad on the plate like Villa Madina has options for you to choose from like tabouli, cole slaw, mixed salad etc but they do ask if you'd like your plate dressed with parsley, pickles etc.  We took everything on it including all 3 sauces (tahini, garlic and hot sauce).  They also give you a pita bread you have to rip out of a sealed plastic bag.  The hot sauce is really not hot.  The tahini is what it is but their garlic sauce is really good.  As far as the meat goes we had a decent portion and was pretty good.  The portion size of the plate is pretty large.  My brother could barely finish his and I finished mine but was quite full.    The only thing I can really compare it to is Villa Madina because it is sort of the same style of food and price.  This is a good place, I'd go back."}
{"text":"one of the best shwarma in town. always go there whenever we are craving shwarma at work. service is nice. price is reasonable.  The meat they use, both beef and chicken are very well cooked. I can tell they dont cut any corners on the slow cooking method.   The veggie sides are also very delicious. they also have the full set of dressing sauce as u would expect. the sandwich toppings selection is also complete.  Parking can be a problem on busy times as they share the lot with burrito brothers. But there are other parking spaces around."}
{"text":"Love schwarmas because of the amount of vegetables that you can have to accompany your plate or sandwich. This place boasts a variety of salads and different types of vegetables such as grilled eggplant and peppers. All the ingredients were fresh and the portions are massive! After all you are paying about $12-13 per beef/chicken schwarma plate which is about $3-4 higher than the average price. For overall quality, ingredients were fresh just the chicken maybe need more flavour.  Also, be aware that the parking lot is not the best. It shares the same lot as Burrito Boyz and a few other businesses and there is only about 6-8 parking spots so you will likely have to park on the street if you come during lunch or dinner hours."}
{"text":"The first time I went there was the day before their opening. They actually werent open! But they gave me, my boyfriend, my boyfriends sister this pastry which I thought was a baklava. Well it was sort of had nuts, crispy philo, honey, and inside was like a mascarpone cheese. It was free!  We promised to go back the next day because we really wanted shawarma.   The next day we went back bf ordered beef shawarma, I had the falafel one, and my bf's sister had chicken. we all got the combo. sort of because we just wanted to food no drinks but i guess it was the owner he said no have drinks so we got our drinks free (THIS was opening day please dont go asking for a free drink lol) anyway we had fries and we got to pick our sides. I picked tabule, and humus...everyone did..lol it was packed full i'm glad they did this but business wise I would not fill it that full. Most people wont finish it and might just throw it out. Hate seing food going to waste, but on my end I was lucky enough to get home in time to keep it in my fridge. ANYWAY  Food was great, fresh, and I had my fries on the side instead of inside only because I liked it not included. hehe.  While we were eating we staff walking around cleaning and also asking all the patrons if we were ok, if we needed anything. Very polite.   Over all the staff is friendly, it is also a clean place. As for parking good LUCK.  read below..  there is another restaurant which I will do a review for next but there is one next to this place and both restaurants are doing well so of course parking gets full fast. To avoid a ticket DONT park across the street where the construction is taking place YOU will get a ticket. instead go behind the mini plaza where the Shawarma Grill Xpress is and there is a HUGE parking spot there. You just have to walk back a little towards the restaurant it isnt far and after your done eating so much food you will need that walk. Plus you avoid getting a ticket. Hope this helps!  **Anyway ive been there recently and they have reduced the amount of tabule and humus inside their side containers which im sad but happy about because some people might not be going home right away to keep the left overs. or some might not even care to finish it and just throw it away."}
{"text":"Food is okay, their portions are way off. Service is alright. On of those spots that are good for maybe quick take out. Meat vs salad ratio is super off. Good luck with that. Awkward location you have to park on the street (Zora) next to the condos as there is barely any space in the strip plaza. Not priced very well against their servings."}
{"text":"I've had chicken shawarma from many places and I found that Shawarma Grill Xpress is one of the best.  The chicken was juicy and seasoned very well.  The additional stuff (I got everything) was delicious and everything was fresh.  The shop is very clean and the staff friendly.  I will be stopping by to try their falafel and other items.  So far, so good!  Please note that the outdoor seating is just a bench."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in need of a late night dinner. Shawarma Grill has late open hours. We decided to get the chicken shawarma wrap, by that time they were out of lamb. Also we ordered one side French fries and a drink. They have homemade juices that look yummy but it's not included with the combo. You are able select your toppings and sauces for your wrap. We took are food to-go. The food, price and customer service was good. They give you a lot of food. My only criticism is the wrap had an unpleasant burnt taste because they put the wrap on the grill once you finishing putting items inside. It almost ruined the taste of the wrap."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken schwarma and the first thing I noticed was the chicken wasn't as greasy compared to the the other schwarma places it was actually quite flavorful. The hot sauce was pretty weak. I believe if they had a better hot sauce it make the schwarma taste better. But overall I thought it was a good schwarma will not hesitant to come back again. Only con was it was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped by this with the initial intention of going to Burrito Boyz next door but did not want to wait in the long line up of \"bros\" with their gym bags getting their burrito protein fix or listen to them talk while wait in line.  This place in my opinion had one of the best shawarmas I had in the Greater Toronto area in years, as the chicken in it was soft, fresh, and non-oily.   The price was good for what I got ($8 including a canned drink) and it was quickly made."}
{"text":"I have to kind of agree with Lambert P.'s review in comparing it to Villa Madina - fast food Middle Eastern; HOWEVER, Villa Madina gives you more bang for your buck.  I've only been once, on a Sunday afternoon and it was very quiet in there.   I'll get straight and to the point.  Pros:  friendly service, nicely flavoured meat.  Cons:  skimpy on the condiments (e.g. imagine being on a diet and you're only allowed 1 TBSP of hummus, well it was spread on that thin); only three little onion pieces and about four little turnip pieces; green pickles had a rancid taste but that could have been a spice they used - I discarded them.  Again, it was probably a spice because I wasn't ill after eating it.   Shawarmas really fill me up and I usually can't eat the whole thing but I was actually still hungry after this one. Tip: if you're a guy, buy two because one will NOT fill you up.  I might return but that would have to depend on how desperate my shawarma craving is that day."}
{"text":"We went when it was just closing, the food was ok but not supper tasty I found. The egg plant stew was not the best I've had. The shawarma chicken was a bit dry. But the customer service was spectacular"}
{"text":"they have daily specials for sandwiches that comes with pop and really is 0.50 off sandwich prices  i ordered the beef plate at ~13. was good, not bad...but was extremely thirsty for the WHOLE day. and quite filling.  also, you choose two sides for the plate order which is cool as its not set order  sit down has a bar facing window,  with perhaps three or four tables for a quick sitdown only (essentially a takeaway place)  gd turnaround...but i did see the pickles, lettuce etc wilted and not at its freshest...but not a big concern for me  **overall probably would not return as there's so many other options and no wow factor"}
{"text":"Ordered mixed shawarma plate with grilled vegetables and lentil rice for take-out, as well as the falafels to try it out.  The plate was amazing-- very large container was filled to the brim. There were more meats (chicken and beef) compared to the rice, which I'm not complaining about, though the lentil rice is really great.  Falafels were a bit hard and nothing to write home about.   Get the lentil rice! And the chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. Not amazing but not average either. I'd say well above average.   I usually order the shawarma wrap but I got the mixed shawarma plate this time. It was really good. Flavours were solid. The chicken could've had more crispy bits but it was late lunch time so the good crispy bits were gone. The beef was really good. Roasted potatoes could've been a bit crispy on the outside but that's tough to do when you have to leave them sitting on the hot table.   Service is impeccable. The lady at the cash is really nice and the guy who puts together the dish is polite.   All in all, it's a decent place to go to if you're feeling like eating shawarma."}
{"text":"ok so all I can say is the shwarmas are realy good but the service can be crap depending on whos there, some times it quick some times its slow, one time there was a girl working who didn't even ask what me and my friend wanted on their shwarmas and proceeded to putting random stuff in it , besides that lol its usualy good"}
{"text":"Ordered: chicken shwarma, fries, hummus, $9.03  Pros: fries are awesome, pretty good portions, hummus is ok, toppings very fresh  Meh:  meat kinda bland.. Maybe because there was hardly any meat on the spit.. I wish I asked for the fresh chicken  Cons: horrible hot sauce!!! Thick and not good  Definitely not the best.. Kinda tastes like something you'd get at the mall.. But maybe it was just my order and it was the bare remnants of the chicken.. I'd try again if I was in the area"}
{"text":"Really solid chicken or beef shawarma.  I always go plate, which comes with an abundance of meat, with two incredibly large sides...i don't usually finish everything, which is a rarity for me due to my fat kid tendencies.    The chicken & beef are house made and seasoned on a spit; no pre-made mystery meats here. These are both fast options...if you go for something that requires grilling, it'll be made fresh but expect to wait 5-15 minutes.    For sides, I always go grilled veg and their eggplant/tomato stuff...it's pretty excellent, and low carb (bonus).  If your into rice or potatoes, both have gotten strong reviews from my colleagues.  As far as sauces, their garlic sauce is excellent, though when you say \"just a tiny bit\" this is interpreted as approximately 1/4 cup...tread lightly unless you wanna smell like \"that guy\" all day.  Lastly, it's run by a guy and his mom...nice folks, support your local family-owned businesses."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Shawarma places. The best in Etobicoke for sure. The plates are packed. You get your money's worth. This is a must for me. Try the mixed plate you won't be disappointed. Open late some night so good for after work."}
{"text":"for a friday night, our tradition is to go out for dinner, in our neck of the woods.  originally having burrito boyz in mind, i wanted shawarma instead.  this place is Amazing, clean, fresh, amazing staff behind the counter.  only two negatives come from this place, they will never know how busy they can be, because burrito boyz is beside it, and the parking lot is super tiny.  the food is very flavorful, lots of options available, efficent, and cost effective.  im SUPER glad i found this place in my neighbourhood.  will come back more often!  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shwarma. The chicken didn't come off the spit and wasn't heated up with a little grilling as other places. Also wasn't toasted after being assembled and therefore resulted in a cold meal. Not done right like other shwarma places"}
