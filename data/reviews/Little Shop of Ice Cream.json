{"text":"we found this place because of posts on Instagram!

nice place to have a sandwich and sit on the patio by rose theatre! 

good service - the line up at lunch was very long but worth it! 

definitely will return to try just the plain grilled cheese."}
{"text":"It's now my third review of this place, and it reflects the fact that my appreciation of this place continues to grow with each visit.

First off, value is about as solid a '5' as I could give anywhere, with virtually everything $5 or less.

I've previously mentioned their grilled cheeses, and I love that they always have a unique offering almost weekly. Last week's Jalape√±o popper one tasted just like you'd expect.

What bring me back to write another review and bring it up to a '5' is that I've now tried their soups a couple times and they're amazing in the truest sense of the word. There's always different soups, but they're homemade, unique and delicious. Probably the closest experience I've had to having my knees buckle when first tasting it like they did on Seinfeld with the Soup Nazi (however, the owner here is anything like him personality wise).

Great food and about the best value you're gonna find."}
