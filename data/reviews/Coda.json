{"text":"This place was awesome! We went here last night to watch stand up comedy. The space was perfect and intimate. The cocktails were awesome too! Get the life on mars drink!"}
{"text":"Great music, nice to have live music in Tremont! Drinks are reasonable for downtown and the atmosphere is great. Definitely leave your coat in your car if it's not too cold though..."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this bar while waiting for a table at Barrio and was glad I did! Staff was very friendly, bar was intimate and drinks were good! Love the decor and bar top! Will definitely be back to try food and signature drinks!"}
{"text":"Coda is AMAZING!! So glad this place is finally open in Tremont.  Went there last night to hear some live music. The music was awesome, the decor of this place is so cool and the atmosphere makes it that much more awesome.  The bar is small but has a wide variety of good drinks. And then there's the food. My God was the food fan-freakin-tastic!!! Get the spaghetti & meatball pizza. You will not regret it! We ordered that pizza and grilled mac n cheese w/ Cheetos and they accidentally brought out the wrong order but let us keep that food too! It was amazing!!  You've got to come to Coda, I can't rave enough about all it's awesomeness!"}
{"text":"It is an odd place in the basement.  I walked down there, then checked for exits, like you would on a plane.  The bathroom is in the back, and there is one.  As in one toilet.  One sink.  One.  The drinks are not expensive which is nice.  I bought my friends drinks and had a few myself, and my bill was $40.  I haven't eaten here...I go for my friend's band once a year.  So for that, it is fine.  I don't know if I would go otherwise, but I might."}
{"text":"You need to visit this new spot in Tremont for some great food and live music. The place is very intimate and have a small bar, a few tables and a dance floor. The decor was on point. They put a lot of thought into the music venue details, from the large graffiti wall that acts as a backdrop to the musicians, to the actual memorabilia in the bar. There was a fun band there that was rocking it out all night.  I love loud music, however, it got a little too loud at times. All part of the experience, right?! The staff was very friendly and took time to answer our questions. Perfect small bar menu of food choices. We ordered 4 different items off the menu. The beef and onion sliders were very flavorful. Chicken and waffles were awesome, however wish the waffles were a little crispier. The grilled cheese sandwich was yummy- it had spinach and was pressed in a waffle iron, and the Cheetos that came with it were extra special with some spicy flavoring. The tempura onion rings were perfectly seasoned, but wish they were a big crispier as well. The onion ring and chicken and waffles were service on drum stick planks. Cool touch. Ill definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"This place is so quirky. And maybe because I am so much so myself - it was a great way to end Friday date night.   A friend of mine mentioned this place months back. When Mr. Man and I found ourselves in Tremont for the evening - I knew we had to check this place out.   We got there around 9 - it was dead and the band was late in setting up. I thought this could easily go one of two ways - we would leave really disgusted or feeling like we found a big hidden gem.   If I could have been more in the mood for a great cocktail - I promise I would have gotten it. They have a huge offering, and even though wine isn't on the list - the serve it too. I was boring and just got a vodka and soda.   BUT - the food.   OK. So, it was like ALL sorts of exciting! The best part of my evening was the little snack page on the menu. That's all it is - it's just a snack page.  BUT IT'S LIKE SOO MUCH MORE. I couldn't decide what I wanted because I literally wanted all the things. A woman across from us ordered a spaghetti and meatball pizza and though we scoffed - when it came out, it looked awesome. Then she and her guests split the massive onion rings.  The 70s-80s cover band started up and the place got lively. Filled to capacity actually, so I was really happy that we got there when we did so that we could pick out our seats.  We ended up getting beef sliders and ...  the popcorn shrimp. And though Mr. Man enjoyed his spicy beef sliders, he didn't enjoy them nearly as much as I enjoyed my popcorn shrimp. It's probably because I cave to popcorn every time. Literally, popcorn shrimp in a bowl of popcorn.   Can I just go on a bit more?  We asked how big the serving of popcorn shrimp was. I figured - for five bucks, I'm going to get a little side plate. The bartender said \"It's just a handful of shrimp in a bowl of popcorn.\" NO WAY JOSE. This was EASILY $15 dollars worth of popcorn shrimp. I ate it the next morning for breakfast and lunch. All snack menu items run between $5 and $10, which is great!   And then the best thing evar happened... (you're gonna flip...)  Cookies and Cream Push-pops. SHUT UP! I know, right?   Bookmark this place now! Go next Friday. Go next Saturday. Take your new date for a quarky and fun time - it's bound to be!"}
{"text":"Coda appears to be a passion project for Cleveland chef Dante Boccuzzi-- a means by which he can further revel in his undying love for all things rock'n'roll. The bar is a small, subterranean affair, drenched in mood lighting, with a floor-level stage serving as its focal point. The walls are meticulously painted with the logos and occasional likenesses of all manner of rock legends (everyone from Cheap Trick to Blondie to Beck!). There isn't much seating and the room can get jaw-clenchingly loud (the men's room is also curiously small, resembling an airplane john more than anything else), but when a band has taken the stage and the drinks are coming hard and fast and patrons begin to clap and laugh in the half-dark, Coda hums with its creator's overwhelming dedication. The menu is meager, consisting mostly of meaty bar staples (chicken wings, sliders, etc.) but Dante is a celebrity chef for a reason, and each dish is cooked up with the same care that went into designing the decor. The cocktail list, too, is outstanding. Drinks are $10, but pack a wallop. Try the Guns N' Roses--the mixture of gunpowder green tea and bourbon may raise an eyebrow or two at first, but the result is an immensely favorable pick-me-up. In sum, Coda is clearly the realization of a clever man's dream. For sheer zeal alone, it simply rocks."}
{"text":"Great place to chill on the weekend, the bands that where there completely rocked. Service was nice, but there was a ton of confusion on our bill, and staff seemed annoyed to have to fix the bill. Other then that staff was friendly, and drinks where great."}
{"text":"Extremely loud and a confined space. They did not have any outdoor seating and you cannot even hear the person next to you speaking. Very frustrating to try and hang out with people and listen to the overtly loud music."}
