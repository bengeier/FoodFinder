{"text":"Everything my wife and I tried was delicious. The location, next to a convenience store, was less than impressive. I am so glad we went inside and gave it a try! Very clean, and the food was as beautiful as it was flavorful.

Two guys at a table behind us mentioned that they like to try a different sushi place twice each month. They ordered the sampler for four people, it looked amazing. They gave Ninja a very favorable review compared to other options in the area - I agree, we will be going back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Ninja is a very nice small restaurant in Mentor on the Lake which serves great Sushi! My girlfriend and I frequent here many times for great sushi and hibachi!"}
{"text":"YES! Who would think that between an Irish pub and a KFC this hidden gem would be a beacon of sushi awesomeness? We were blown away. I haven't had sushi this good since leaving the west coast and ohhhhh! The fish was fresh, service was perfect, presentation was outstanding, and dessert was lovely. Everywhere my husband and I go we are taking about this place. We were blown away and WILL BE BACK! Go!"}
{"text":"This place was mighty! The portions were ample, the ingredients were fresh and expertly prepared, and the prices were very reasonable. Great find!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service i have ever been privileged to experience. The sushi chef took incredible care and diligence on each dish. He was knowledgeable and displayed true passion for his work. We were graciously given two courses, desert and a sushi roll, on the house. The staff was friendly and pleasant. I highly recommend this hidden gem on the lake!:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and service.  Best around.  Can't believe I used to eat at Fuji by the mall.  Yuk.  This place is the deal.  We had a bunch of different rolls, raw and cooked.  Only con is no beers or saki.  Food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have had no complaints. I usually do take out and everything is fresh and ready to go before I get there. I've had rolls and sashimi each time. The parking lot is sometimes a pain because of all the bar flies drinking next door."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast service. Great for take out. 

It's small but comfortable to have a quiet dinner. The appetizers are numerous and tasty. The specials are creative. Great sushi. Great flavors."}
{"text":"Was never really a sushi guy, but since I've started going here with some friends I've been converted. They're quick, easy, and inexpensive. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best sushi bar I've been to. The atmosphere is great. Don't expect the luxury. This is a local restaurant that will blow your socks off. The sushi is so fresh and so good. The presentation is great as well. I love this place but stay the hell away. It's my spot and I don't want the yuppies ruining it."}
{"text":"Today I went to ninja sushi with my family and it was delicious. I got chicken and rice and I got a normal portion. I got to take some home for leftovers. I also got some vegetables. there is soy sauce on the table so you can use it. it is very expensive but it's worth it. the waitress was very nice. she helped me put my leftovers in the box."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never seen this place.  Open for about 1 + years and I live close by.  Sushi is delicious and reasonably priced.  I got the Shrimp and Scallop combination Hibachi dinner for $15.95.  Very well prepared and delicious.  Will definitely go back.  Not much for ambiance and decoration but the food is great!  Worth trip."}
{"text":"Update. They have sake and small wine selection, which is just enough. Definitely 5 stars. For sushi lovers who don't want to dress up for great sushi."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in MOL. Eat here once a week. The staff is amazing and the food is always fresh and delicious. So happy they are close and open late!"}
{"text":"The lasting impression that you'll probably walk away with after you've enjoyed an excellent sushi meal at Ninja, is how such a good place could be tucked away in such a shitty location.

Tucked away in a nondescript local in a strip mall in Mentor on the Lake, you'd never think you'd be able to get such excellent sushi. The restaurant is small, with a small sushi bar, and tasteful modern decor.

The choice in sushi is either in platers or alacarte as well as a selection of Hibachi style entrees that are also delicious. 

Prices are reasonable, and every dish was excellent, including the miso soup that comes with a meal. The included salad was probably the only disapoint, and came drenched in dressing, though still above average.

They at the time of this writing are in the process of obtaining a liquor licence, so no alcohol is available, but this hardly detracts from your meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Stopped in for dinner on a Friday night.  Ordered fried rice, spider maki roll, California roll, avacado salad and spicy tuna roll. All were really good. Avacado was fresh and creamy, fried rice could have been a little more flavorful, sushi rolls pretty good.
Service very good. Food came quickly. Will definitely try them again. It's nice to have somewhere close to get good sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mentor! We are always treated well and nothing beats a free sample of their crab salad. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I can't properly express how much I wanted this place to be good!  I live close by, and good hibachi style food and sushi is a dream come true!

A dream unfulfilled sadly.  I've been back over and over since they opened hoping things would change but no luck. 

Three times I've dined in but the experience is always the same.  The food quality is the same whether I'm dining in or doing take out (more on that in a second).  The biggest issue I've had when dining in is that there have always been kids (obviously belonging to a member of the staff) watching the only TV in the restaurant.  The channel is never changed for guests, and its very uncomfortable bringing friends and business clients here with Blue's Clues or Nickelodeon blasting full volume through the otherwise very nice restaurant.  I understand needing to keep your kids with you at work, and they have always been very well behaved, but can they not do without TV for forty minutes?  I would rather have no TV at all than have to talk business over cartoons.

My other issue with dining in stems from the one time I asked the hostess/ cashier/ waitress if they shared the wifi password.  She held out her hand for my phone and said \"Let me.\"    I said no thank you, it wasn't that important, and she proceeded to to take my phone out of my hand and type the password in herself.   I'm sorry... for one thing, I don't want anyone grabbing my phone away from me, for two, is your wifi password that much of a prized secret?

Sadly, on to the food.  The hibachi style entrees have never been bad.  Nothing special, but not bad.   The sushi however I could never recommend. I once ordered a tuna roll, and the raw tuna inside was black......  black.  I don't mean dark red, I am very familiar with raw tuna, this was BLACK. That shouldn't have been served to a guest.  I once tried the salmon skin roll.  Salmon skin should be light and puffy, not the construction paper like confetti that I received.  Clearly it had been fried long ago and was very very old, not something I want to see from people I'm trusting with sometimes raw seafood.

I wanted them to do well, but after a year in business, they haven't improved at all."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. My boyfriend brought it to me and it met our expectations and then some! We've been there twice in 3 days!"}
{"text":"After finding this on Yelp last week, my son and I decided to give this a try before a movie.  I have to say that everything was really good!  This is the best sushi in lake county right now IMO.  Very well presented, fresh fish and great service, what else can you ask for?  Not inexpensive, but good quality.  I recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It's about time we gave a great Sushi place in Northeast Ohio! Way better than any other sushi place around .  Very fresh all the time.  They are super friendly all the time.  Great service and would recommend to anyone.  The hibachi is also amazing ! There's not one bad thing to eat here."}
{"text":"Great sushi! My co-workers and I go here every few weeks for lunch. Prices are decent and the quality is fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim in the 4 hours between a wedding and the reception. Amazing. Great food--we had the fire boat appetizer (spicy seafood salad topped with avocado), the ninja maki roll (lobster tempura, cream cheese, smoked salmon), chicken teriyaki, and unagi sashimi. The portions were generous without being excessive, the quality was wonderful, and the server was attentive. 

The exterior is nothing to write home about--an old strip mall--but don't be fooled. This place would be at home in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Ninja is a hidden gem that we found a few years ago. The sushi is always fresh and amazing and the service is awesome. It is a small place but it always crowded. They offer sushi but also offer hot food for those who don't like sushi. I highly recommend the Ninja a Rice, it has steak, scallops and shrimp and it is a huge portion."}
{"text":"ITS A MUST TRY!!!

My wife and i have been going here since it opened a few years ago and they never disappoint. It has been awhile since we ate here since we have 2 kids under 2 which make going out a project so tonight we got carry out. We ordered the sushi for 2 plus a roll of the cheifs choice (always a good idea and off menu) and 2 slices of the chocolate crepe cake.  The sushi and nigiri we very fresh and flavorful the plating even for take out was out standing (looked so good i did not want to mess it up). The fresh diced jalapeno that topped some of the rolls was just the right amount of spice.  The chocolate crepe cake is tops on my list for desserts it is not overly sweet and well balance. I could eat a whole cake if i bought one.  All in all ninja sushi never dissapoints weather dine in or carry out, the food is always fresh service is always top notch (nacey is the best) and now they serve alcohol my next visit will be for dine in.

Thanks for another great meal!"}
{"text":"A+. This place is great. Some of the better fish I've had off the coasts. Very good service and amazing deserts. If you haven't been, you like sushi and you live within driving distance.. Go!"}
{"text":"Love love love! This place may be small but it packs a punch. The staff was wonderful and the food amazing. We even ordered a second round of the Tuna Tataki to take home!! I have several food intolerances (including rice) and they were able to cook around it. I will definitely come back to this place and hope to see them flourish."}
{"text":"The best Sushi! As soon as I walked in it reminded me of the little Sushi houses I would frequent when I lived in Kyoto. The sushi was just as good. Everything fresh, clean, and delicious. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best sushi that I've had so far in the Cleveland area.

For starters I will admit that I was hesitant to come in because of the number of all five stars. I was almost suspicious of how highly rated this restaurant was.

Uni was creamy and delicious.
Extremely fresh.
Aji ( horse mackerel) great texture and flavor.  
I wish I saved more room to try the special fish Ken had to offer. 

Ken knows his craft.  He is bringing high quality sushi to this area.  I want this place to be filled with customers so that he can continue to offer top quality sushi. 

I will definitely be back.  Omikase next time :)"}
{"text":"Remember: You get what you pay for. Ninja is more expensive than Youngs and Fuji, but certainly better! My husband and I have been religious followers of Fuji's half price sushi on Mondays/Tuesdays. And while their sushi isn't bad... it's \"half price\"... so soy sauce and Wasabi required. But Ninja... even their plain tuna roll was flavorful. The seaweed was even tasty.

I had the Sushi Deluxe (9 pieces of fish with 1 tuna roll) and a side of fried rice. My hubby had a Spider roll and a side of lo mein. And every... single... bite was amazing! All of the sushi on my plate was great. They topped one of the white fish with a small slice of pepper and caviar - great flavor! Presentation was  eter than Fuji has ever been. And our fried rice and lo mein sides were your standard hibachi restaurant flavor... which is fine as we both enjoy it. And we shared a shumai shrimp pot sticker style appetizer. The dumpling itself was okay, but the sweet teriyaki dipping sauce was the star.

So in the end, all of those items plus 2 Pepsis, cost us $50. And while the sticker shock set in at first... we stopped and thought about it and realized that everything was higher quality, better presented, and more flavorful. So a little higher price tag was no big deal. Plus fast lunch service with a smile. We will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"amazing, amazing sushi!!! nearly all of their fish comes straight from japan, multiple times a week. you can count on everything to be fresh. 

dining room is small - in a cozy way. everybody there was super friendly & made good recommendations, and every single roll we ordered was perfect or near perfect. 

as far as quality goes, this place is on par with or actually better than Otani. I don't think Otani's fish is quite as fresh :) oh and it's cheaper too! pricing is super reasonable. 

don't let the cheesy name or outside appearance fool you. ninja sushi is the real deal.

also- lots of sashimi/fish offered that isn't on the menu. make sure you check the wall or ask about them!



the only thing they could improve upon is drink options, maybe get a liquor license to serve some sakes & offer a few juices in the meantime."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things we decided to order a carryout dish to try.  Got a shrimp &salmon hibachi combo with a side of lo mein. The food is extremely tasty a bit small on the portioning but i'll take quality sometime over quantity. We will be sure to go in and sit as we now see how nicely designed the interior is and how much of a variety of dishes they have. Glad we finally tried this place as should you, do not let the location or exterior fool you this is the real deal and maybe one of the best spots in greater cleveland."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for sure! As a sushi fanatic, I can confidently say they are one of the best sushi spots in town."}
{"text":"Just moved to Ohio from California, so I've tried many high end sushi spots. I have to say this place shocked me so much because the quality and the flavors were phenomenal!! It could definitely compete with all the hot spots in California. Thank you so much for the great service and food! I will be coming here for sushi from now on!"}
{"text":"If possible, just go ahead and scrap the regular menu (teriyaki chicken, etc) and go for the sushi. 

The sushi chef here is well trained and they go for the freshest ingredients in the Midwest. The sushi for two doesn't come in a ho hum sushi boat but in a beautiful arrangement of food, flowers and a little flair. If you have the cash, I would highly recommend the omakase (chef's choice). They select the finest ingredients of the day and typically include lesser known/more expensive sushi such as salmon belly, fatty tuna, uni, king crab, fresh scallop, etc. I have to say that the fresh scallop is one of my favorites here.

Even for their regular rolls (which we grab if we're on I-90 on road trip regardless if it's slightly out of the way), the sushi is fresh and flavorful.

Like other yelpers said - it's the best sushi for the best value in the Cleveland area. 

Protip - order the chocolate crepe cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Never thought I would ever say this. From California and this is as good as it is in California! Quality fresh delicious goodness! A+++"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by the outstanding quality of the food. I lived in Japan for a few years and I know the real stuff. I was taken aback by the strange people passing by the front on the sidewalk. It seems that I missed the tattoo parlor next door on the way in. Ignore the strange location and come in for excellent authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Delicious as close to a West Coast Japanese restaurant as possible. Enjoy the small traditional style restaurant. Great spicy sushi selections along with the traditional tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Read a few reviews and thought why not I will give it a shot. I was NOT disappointed, the place doesn't look like it has amazing sushi but wow it was good. We had the Sushi for 2 and every bite was delicious, except I didn't like the octopus that much too chewy for me. The place is definitely a hidden gem and if you love sushi...stop sometime."}
{"text":"Seriously I have only had sushi equivalent in California!
The fish was so so fresh and the portions were perfect! I had an Alaska roll, yellowtail roll, and tuna belly (toro) sushi. They were all simply amazing! I highly highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Second best sushi restaurant in Cleveland area for me! But Ninja's price is more affordable ... Hmmm... Hard to decide which is the number one then...
Anyway, very fresh material , good portion, and great presentation for sushi. Make sure you check out their Facebook page. They post pictures of fresh fish they get every Friday and special desserts."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and I will be back for sure. The sushi was some of the best I've had (other big cities included not just local). I had a Super Maki roll, Red Dragon roll, and Spicy shrimp roll. The tuna was extremely fresh and vibrant. No fishy smell or texture issues. Their roll combinations are great too.

The restaurant itself was clean and comfortable. I was very impressed with this hidden gem. I will go out of my way to drive out here to get sushi it's completely worth the drive."}
{"text":"A disappointing meal after reading all the rave reviews. The menu does not compare to the pictures posted online. Pricey for only 6 pcs sushi rolls. Our son ordered a  habachi meal which only came with soup, no salad. Yuku sushi restaurant in Painesville is a much better value!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for food without as much as a check-in from the waitress or manager. Absolutely ridiculous service and wait time. When addressed with staff, was told that they're busy and the waitress ARGUED with me that they're busy and I'm not getting it. Literally, never again will I come and I do not suggest you schlep down here either."}
{"text":"Small and hidden away but big on flavor. Great customer service as the wait staff was highly attentive. The Filet Hibachi was delicious with the steak being super tender. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. This little gem is tucked into a strip mall flanked by a convenient store and the Ale Haus bar. The restaurant is unassuming & small but the interior is modern & urban.The sushi is very good, prices are affordable and food presentation is impressive! Had bites of sushi and the shrimp teriyaki. Both were fresh and good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a real nice little place with yummy sushi. They have wine beer and sake too. From the outside looks like just a carryout place but it's nice! 

We got the sushi for two which was a lot. I took some home. The green Hats are super awesome. Next time I will order more of those. Service was very good. Lots of people were taking to go so it's popular and very fresh   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you stumble across a complete SURPRISE.  Ninja Sushi is just that in the most pleasant way.  Sitting between a tattoo parlour and a pizza place next to a Convenient.  I would drive past that place so easily it's not funny.  I came away TOTALLY IMPRESSED.  

Presentation -.  Absolutely GORGEOUS!  we all know we eat with our eyes first and Ninja does a masterful job of presenting.  DRAMATIC would be the best description.

Freshness - Its sushi so the fish needs to be fresh.  The rolls we had were VERY FRESH.  They keep their fish wrapped tight when they aren't cutting them.

Flavors and textures - my biggest pet peeve with sushi is when it gets drowned in sauces.  Makes me think you are trying to hide something.  Not the case at Ninja.  The rolls had an appropriate amount of sauces and textural enhancements to make them interesting while not taking away from the star of the show... 

Service - Very pleasant and extremely quick.  I feel like the staff there are very accommodating.  Overall an A for our service

Cleanliness - Their Kitchen is in open view and there was nothing at all that made me worry.  Everything appeared from the eye to be very clean.

I enjoyed my dinner at Ninja, if you are on the East Side give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed.  Try the Wasabi Skin Potstickers if you like spice.  It was different but I thought very tasty."}
{"text":"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! I have been eating Ninja Sushi Hibachi for about 2 years now and the food is good. However I recently ordered our usual sushi order of about $70 worth of food and they said it would take about 40 mins. Came in to get it and they said they don't have that order. They tried telling me I must have called some place in Michigan. I showed them my phone with the number dialed and call times and they eventually found a waitress who took the order and never put it in they system because \"they were busy\". They \"offered\" to still make the food FOR NO DISCOUNT even when I asked and politely said I hope you can understand now my family and I are out dinner after already waiting for 40 mins and your response it basically \"too bad\". Offering to do something for full price you were already supposed to have done isn't a solution.  Thanks I'll pass. This is not how you keep customers. Very odd and rude experience. I will be going to the other handful of sushi places near me from now on."}
{"text":"Really really enjoyed this place the 2 times I've been there. The first time was just my wife and I and the most recent time was another couple with us. Appetizers were fresh, fast and tasty. Server built rapport with us and made some great suggestions. Seasonal promo of jumbo oysters with a soy mignonette was AMAZING!  Oysters were the size of my fist. Multiple courses of sushi came out fast and tasty. Best part of this meal was at the end of the night. Server came up and saw me touching my wife's belly. She asked if we were having a baby (we are). Server brought out a complimentary creme brûlée with a blown sugar \"dome\" on top with berries. What a great experience at our new favorite place. Will be coming back here as long as they are in business."}
{"text":"I love this place! They get crowded pretty easily, but take out it always super quick! Polite and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Family owned business. Great Sushi! The best Sushi I have found in Lake County. Diverse Sushi menu. I plan to come back again for the Hibachi steak dishes. If you love Japanese food you need to give them a try."}
{"text":"Most people have no clue about this little restaurant. I have only been there once to sit down and eat, but the service was excellent. The food (the hibachi portion) is very good and fresh. 

Now the sushi. If you love sushi, I would definitely try it from here. I usually get it as takeout. It is so good. Everything is fresh and tastes delicious. They really know how to make sushi. 

The sit down portion of the restaurant is pretty small, but it isn't too bad. I hope that more people check this location out because they have great potential."}
{"text":"Christmas eve at Ninja Sushi.....the best Christmas eve dinner ever. They went out of their way to prepare us a spectacular platter complete with volcanic \"smoke\". Everything was beautifully prepared....a combination of sushi and sashimi...the freshest fish ever. We are so lucky to have a restaurant of this caliber in Mentor Ohio!"}
{"text":"To put it politely, this restaurant left a lot to be desired. My husband enjoyed his sushi, but my first bite of their sushi rolls was a spicy tuna roll. No amount of spicy mayo can cover the fishiness that was the tuna in the roll, so I ended up trying to make the most of the cucumber roll, the avocado roll, and the tempura shrimp roll. It sort of ruined the experience for me to bite into something that clearly wasn't fresh.

Fresh fish isn't supposed to be fishy in most cases. Tuna at the very least isn't supposed to be fishy, and they tried to cover up the lack of freshness, and they still failed.

I wanted this place to be good so badly. I really did. But my experience was ruined. My advice to future visitors: Stick to the cooked or vegetarian stuff to make sure you don't end up with something that's clearly about to go off that they cover with spicy mayo hoping that no one will notice. A place in Zanesville made up for it and redeemed Ohio sushi for me, but this restaurant? I'll avoid it from now on if we drive through the area again.

It gets two stars, because my experience sucked, while my husband's was pretty okay. I had such high hopes, based on other reviews..."}
{"text":"We stopped in here because of the Yelp review. The place is small, and has great food. We ordered both sushi and habachi. The food was ordered and food was delivered quickly. Both items were great and tasted fresh. I would recommend The place to anyone who likes type of grub."}
{"text":"Impeccable sushi... great atmosphere... and did I mention the INCREDIBLE sushi... bravo"}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star except for no liquor license - so while the food is awesome I may not suggest it for a night out with friends. Small intimate place with Sushi bar. I had spicy tuna & crab roll, wished I would have went with my first instinct and got yellowfin tuna....oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"I'd definitely come back to explore more sushi options. First try, got the Green Hat specialty roll and sumo combo hibachi with salmon and steak. The hibachi was decent, not very flavorful. But the maki roll was great!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant for sushi in the mentor area. I have been all over and the quality here is outstanding! The only reason I give the restaurant 4 put of 5 starts is because the music can be very obnoxious. I wish they would pick music that is calmer and quieter."}
{"text":"No need for soy sauce with your suishi here! Fish was perfect temperature and presentation was an unexpected surprise. Do not judge by the look of the outside! Cozy inviting and warm when we entered, greeted by the chef. I'm picky about my suishi and have sampled the best in my travels...ninja is definately the best so far and true to suishi as suishi should be. Worth a visit so you can discover the little things that make this joint a new local favorite."}
{"text":"The appetizers and sushi were excellent, as was the service! The hibachi was just OK. The shrimp hibachi was the best, the chicken was marginal and the salmon was overcooked. We'll be back for the appetizers!!"}
{"text":"We have NEVER had a bad meal here! The service is outstanding and doesn't get any better! It's such a little hidden gem, that most people wouldn't think to go to! Too bad for them, but good for us! When we think sushi, we think here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on Valentine's day and got the tricolor sushi plus the chicken hibachi dinner. Both of us now have food poisening and my boyfriend had to call off work because of how sick he was. I called to speak to the manager and he acted as if I was inconveniencing him, and then gave me a phone number to call and then hung up on me. Very very rude. Our waitress was amazing, although it was not her fault it's a shame how management treated me. Never again will we visit, and we will be telling our friends about this as well. Happy Valentines Day to us right?"}
{"text":"Soo goood. I can't believe I've just found the place, been living in the area for years!"}
{"text":"Fresh, creative, eye-popping artistic displays of sushi. On top of that it's delicious! The restaurant is clean, very small and does more takeout. The service is friendly. There is hibachi for those who don't like fish, but it isn't the kind that gives you the comedy show with the choo- choo trains and flying saki. 

If you like sushi, this will quickly become a favorite place for you. My only disappointment is they don't serve any alcohol. I can't deduct for that because it's not who they claim to be. They're primarily Japanese take-out and and beautiful presentations of sushi for those who dine in. They do it really really well!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest Sushi bars I have been too. I loved sushi... but I had only ever tried a select few and was afraid to try the rest. 

The guy behind the counter walked me through the whole menu and convinced me to try a raw salmon, and flounder. I was so nervous, but he talked me into it. Even gave me the flounder to try on the house. I've never had a sushi bar do this, and for this, they receive 5 Stars! It was absolutely awesome! Thank you for the treatment"}
{"text":"Ordered Sushi to go and it was horrible. Fish was smelly and NOT Fresh at all. Would never try again!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the market and surrounding markets. My wife and I are sushi lovers and our kids eat sushi, as well. They always recommend the pink lady. My wife and I recommend everything. The chef is a sushi genius. He is always trying different things. They had a sushi special that had scallops on top. I would never had thought of that. It was delicious. There fish is always fresh and we have never had an issue with their food. We have issues elsewhere with the quality of fish being old and fishy. The quality here is always great. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"WOW, did you know most Sushi places are closed on Sundays, me neither, but NINJA IS OPEN !!  After running down the list of places to go on a Sunday we decided to give Ninja a try based on its close proximity to home and its better than average reviews.  Yes, it wedged in a mini retail strip, parking was no problem but must be tricky Mon-Fri since there was some \"parking for only  \"  signs.  Ninja is fresh, clean and new looking inside so much so I had to ask \"how long you been open?\"   1.5 yrs for those keeping score.  The place isn't very large so I would think there might be a wait during peek times but the size makes it a little more cozy and less mainstream restaurant. No booths though, I'm a booth guy but got over it as soon as the food hit the table.  We started out with gyoza or pot-stickers for us laypeople and they were awesome !  Hot and flavorful so much so I had to have a 2nd round of them :)    We had a sampling of various sushi rolls and all were very tasty and the fish ones weren't all \"fishy\" and that's a good thing. The rice was cooked dead on.  I prefer (insist) on having my sauces on the side which allows me to select  how my sushi will taste with what sauce so the photo isn't going to be representative of how yours will hit the table unless you request sauce on the side. (and catch them before they squirt all kinds of sauce on it)   

bottom line is we'll be back for sure !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and definitely a sleeper. Don't let the location or outside area scare you away.:) 

Enjoyed the tuna tataki for an app and it was a nice portion for the price and was in a delicious sauce. Also had the Red Dragon and the Super Maki and they were delicious. Second round was the Tiger Crunch (average but mostly bc it didn't have much to it and that was my husband's preference) and an order of wasabi shumai. Wasabi shumai definitely had a kick (we were warned), but would probably not order again. Everything else worth every penny! They weren't crowded, but service was fast. Also saw two people in and out quickly for carry-out. If you're looking for good sushi without all the frills of getting dressed up and hitting the town - this is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I agree this is probably the best sushi we have eaten in a long long time, the now closed sushi rock of Beechwood was close, but that's been out if business for many years."}
{"text":"Ninja really exceeded my expectations!! The sushi is incredible and fresh, the presentation really lets you know that they care. The decor inside the little restaurant makes you feel right at home. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna roll I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Peach sake is mind blowing. Unique and fresh sushi. Great service and creme brûlée to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sushi is always very fresh tasting! I've never had anything I didn't like here!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to discover this little storefront had maybe the best nigiri & hibachi (the food, not the show) that I have ever had."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that you wouldn't think to go into but big on taste and value. Very clean and quiet. Sushi is great for the value. Recommended highly."}
{"text":"Great place. Everyone was so nice. Food was excellent.  I would not have tried this place if not for the Yelp reviews.  The outside plaza does not look like a place for a restaurant of this quality. 

Price seemed much better than other hibachi places. 

Service was great. Inside is very clean. Food presentation excellent. 

Give this place a try.  Me and the wife found our new date place / take out."}
{"text":"I can not believe how high the reviews are for this place... I ordered a spicy tuna roll and got a slimy, brown thing wrapped in rice. It tasted like old canned tuna. Disgusting. I forced one piece down and threw away the rest. The avocado roll was okay. I won't be returning. \"Best sushi in Ohio??\" Oh my God. I can't even imagine what you've consumed in the past if this is what you think is good sushi. Yuck."}
{"text":"The menu here has the sushi right on the front page, not buried in the back, which told me up front they care about the sushi. This is a small place with great service, but the quality of the sushi is why I come back. Well done rolls with small amounts of rice, fresh fish, good selection, elegant presentation, and good serving sizes."}
{"text":"Wish they were closer is all i can say. Probably the best sushi i have had in the cleveland area and we have done the leg work. First off the Miso soup was amazing, the best broth i think i have ever had. The kani salad was better then most. The rolls which are inexpensive compared to places in beach wood and downtown were great as well with a lot of creative flavors. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love sushi.  I love finding places like this... hole in the wall between a tattoo shop and a convenient store.  Atmosphere was appropriate.  Server was friendly and helpful.  Most importantly... THEY HAVE SUSHI WITH FRUIT ON IT!!!! I have had kiwi, mango, and a number of other pieces of fruit on my sushi but nothing locally... until now.  The salty and sweet is something you HAVE to try.  The chef was super friendly and of course... the sushi was spot on.  Order some traditional rolls... And they did not disappoint.  Order some rolls a little 'off the cusp' and again, was not disappointed.  Best sushi in town.... hands down... I'm a poet and I don't even know it."}
{"text":"Delish and medium priced. The only downside is they don't stray away from their set menu- I always order the same but my friends wanted different things but were denied. The store is also really nicely done and cozy. A good little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time going to Ninja and I am sorry I waited this long! It was so good I went back again today. This is by far the BEST sushi I have ever had. I've tried 3 different rolls, 3 different deserts, the seaweed salad and the tuna tataki appetizer.  The fish is very fresh and tasty. The presentation is delightful! The deserts are to die for! If you have not gone her GO!! They also have hibachi for non sushi lovers :)"}
{"text":"Very nice elegant looking place. I ordered the pick 3 hibachi and got 2 steak 1 chicken the chicken was amazing but the steak had that hamburger taste to it so I was not a fan but I'm definitely coming back the soup salad and rice are all fantastic just ask for extra brown sauce ohhhhhhhhhh sooo good"}
{"text":"I found this place on Instagram from one of the people I follow on there and she said this place is a must! That alone intrigued me as there doesn't seem to be many stand out sushi places here in the heart of America.

I'm not going to lie, I had very high hopes coming here. My current favorite place is Pacific East so this review is going to be based on a comparison of the two. Pacific East seems to have varying reviews but I'll explain my reasoning, sorta.

Overall, the sushi was good. No complaints there. My friend and I had the Sashimi for two that came with two rolls. I tend to order my sashimi individually as the combo platters usually just give you the basic cuts with the crazy price. Ours came with the regular salmon and tuna but also came with some other cuts as well that I have not had. That's always a plus. The presentation was very nice and all the cuts didn't seem old. I can't really say fresh because everything is pretty much received frozen but they were \"fresh\" as in not thawed out and sitting there for days waiting to be sold.

What I disliked about the place was that it was hyped and the menu is very basic as far as the variety of fish offered. Pacific has a lot but then again they don't always have everything as its seasonal but it's good to know that they are willing to carry them. The menu here was very basic and I didn't see the crepe cake listed, which we did order. It was something we saw on Yelp and had to ask. We had the chocolate one and it was very good and worth it if it is made in house as they claim.

Overall, it's just another cookie cutter sushi place. I drove up from the Akron area just to eat here and I doubt I'll make another trip. I'd much rather go to Pacific East if I'm going to make the drive for sushi."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint, a hidden gem. Good sushi,  good hibachi and a kid friendly menu. Prices are on par with similar places."}
{"text":"Great local place! My boyfriend and I both had a hibachi dish and a sushi appetizer and both were kick ass. Good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go for all different taste. If family member not into sushi, there are other menu like hibachi and food. Quality of food is really good."}
{"text":"Great local business, I usually end up eating there/ordering take out once every two or so weeks. I have not been unhappy with ANYTHING I've ordered from there, and the staff has even recognized me as a returning customer. I've recommended this restaurant to friends and family, and received positive feedback from them also!"}
{"text":"Traveling through Mentor on business, trying to stick to my healthy diet and avoid all the cheeseburgers, this was about the only option with Yelp reviews. I  was not disappointed!! 

This place is a lovely if lonely outpost of something different, I hope they are patronized. My sushi sashimi combo was expertly prepared and really exquisite presentation. The fish they called white tuna was like butter. Miso and salad were meh but the fish shines!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted hibachi without all the knife juggling and sitting at a communal table with strangers? Then Ninja is for you. But seriously, the food is good. I was more impressed with the sushi than the hibachi actually. Everything fresh and tastes great. The reason I couldn't go 5 stars is the restaurant itself. It's small and you leave smelling like hibachi. It's loud, cramped, and the servers are trying hard but are young and not so efficient. So I'll be back for take-out sushi. If you would have told me ten years ago there'd be a decent sushi place in MOL, I wouldn't have believed you, but here you are."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this place is amazing! Excellent food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I eat at Ninja at least once a week (carryout). Service is consistently fast and the woman that answers the phone knows me and my order by name. My friends all know Ninja is a hidden secret in Mentor."}
{"text":"I have sent family and friends to this GEM of a Restaurant. you are missing out by not going here."}
{"text":"Amazing service - the fish was some of freshest I've had(I've had a lot). I had the sashimi deluxe and I couldn't finish it! Miso soup, salad and a crab meat salad, and 15 pieces of amazing quality fish. If you're are hesitant don't be, wow!! I can't believe this here. Won't be able to stay away!"}
{"text":"Never liked sushi before, I tried it one time and I didn't like it, until Ninja moved in around the corner! I gave in and tried it again, and now I'm addicted! Their Philadelphia Roll is one of my favorite foods in town, I could eat it every day. I also recommend the tempura shrimp roll, the spicy crab roll, spicy shrimp roll, spicy salad, and the yaki soba noodles. The prices went up across the board a bit recently, but you get what you pay for. 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Wow, this is really good sushi- it's a shame it's all the way out in Mentor on the Lake where most of the hipsters don't live to enjoy it, but hey it's not THAT far!

After hearing so many rave reviews about this place, we took off on a Saturday afternoon to go grab lunch (along with fellow yelpers too).

And boy, was it worth it. This sushi is by far the best sushi I have had in CLE. And seriously, that's a big statement.

It's a rather small restaurant, located on a random strip plaza. I was really hesitant at first to go here- I mean, it's not in the downtown area at all, not in an area of hipsters.... but mentor on the lake.

It's a pretty small restaurant- with a group of 9 + one baby, we nearly took up most of their restaurant.

However, the food was amazinggggggg.

The prices for the sushi are quite fair- I mean, for the amount of FRESH fish you get, the quantity, the presentation- it knocks the other sushi joints in CLE out of the water.

We ordered the sashimi deluxe- a beautiful arrangement (and I mean, the presentation is pretty insane), of super fresh fish and a rather large amount- for only twenty some bucks. Jeez, that's a good deal!

The fatty tuna was delicious. And then we ordered the omakase- whoaaaaa that was really really good.

And once again, the presentation of everything was great- it was super impressive. I was not expecting it, given it's location!

We also ordered the crepe cake for dessert- and yes, it's like a Lady M cake- I was super duper impressed.

Delicious fish- I mean, it's not like Tokyo quality, but it's pretty good ESPECIALLY for CLE!!! I give it a solid five stars.

GO GO GO!!! If you crave sushi, don't go anywhere else in CLE (believe me, you'll be pretty disappointed)- take the drive and RUN TO THIS PLACE!!! It's good!

I'll be back when it's warmer to try the rest of the menu- it's worth the drive. :)"}
{"text":"First time here and We Will be back!  We had the tuna tataki and wasabi shumai for appetizers both were fantastic!!  For the entree smoked salmon sushi, jalapeno incident (absolutely fantastic), spicy salmon roll and Philadelphia roll. We loved them all!!  Very friendly staff.  This is our new place to go for Sushi!  Oh and dessert cheesecake tempura, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to Ninja Hibachi. As with my other previous visits I was extremely satisfied and blown away with not only the exceptional service from being welcomed at the door, the friendly light conversation from the staff, to the expertly prepared and artfully garnished food. 

I came for lunch and I was the only patron in the establishment which was nice and relaxing. I ordered a bowl of miso soup and some a la carte sushi for an appetizer. For my main course I order the sushi deluxe which was 9 different species of fish that came along with a tuna roll. Everything was prepared fresh and was garnished with artfully cut fruit, a light drizzling of sauce on some of the fish pieces as well as some that were also topped of with brightly colored roe and garnished with greens. The meal looked like a piece of art and I almost didn't want to eat it. Everything was superb and I definitely will be coming back! 

Don't pass by this place without giving it a shot because of its odd location in a strip plaza between a tattoo parlour and a pizza shop/bar. When you walk in you will forget what its next to and the food won't disappoint. 

The only con I can think of is that this place runs a little higher price wise than Sumo Boy, Fugi, and Youngs, However, the price is only a $1 or 2 more for certain items and the fact that everything is prepared in plain sight right in front of you with a excellent knowledgeable chef whom of which with no hesitation when I asked told me excatly where he gets his fish supply, how he keeps and prepares the fish for safe consumption, and is willing to accommodate your pallet depending on your food allergies earns this place a 5/5 in my opinion!"}
{"text":"It's up there. Best and I were led to this spot by fellow Yelpers. We are so glad! Sushi rolls had a good ratio of rice, so it did not overwhelm the seafood with starch, striking a fair balance.

Hear ye! They received their liquor license. Previous Yelpers may rejoice. As someone who was previously employed in a top sushi spot for 5 plus years, I can confidently give a thumbs up to the proper cutting of the fish and the beautiful attention to presentation. This is better than most, and a true find. The space is quite limited, basic, but quite clean. 

Ninja may not have the most romantic ambience but it's a good spot for a small and fun tri or quad squad get together or a casual QT night for sushi lovers. 

I can't say I have ever really frequented hibachi restaurants but I know half of the draw is the showmanship of the chef. No seated shows available here, but as others have mentioned, it an appreciated alternative for those who prefer not to have sushi.

So. Libations are in the house.

Let's see an cocktail menu, Mr. Ninja."}
{"text":"What a treasure in Mentor, Ohio. Big city sushi in small town America. We will be back."}
{"text":"I wish we could do 1/2 ratings because I would to give ninja a 4.5 out of 5. 

This is a small but very cool spot to hang out for sushi and hibachi. We had no idea we had a hibachi place so close. 

The restaurant had a very cool look, I love the dark chocolate wood table and chairs. Such a good vibe. The staff was very nice and we placed a pretty large order of sushi (you can see that in the photo) which came out rather quickly. The sushi and sashimi was very nice. Very fresh. I also tried the cheese cake tempura, wow! Don't skip it. 

Here's the bad....and this is minor stuff but...the miso soup, it was ok I've had much better. The chop sticks they proved, I don't know, I just didn't like them. They felt much to thick and I just struggled using them. Normally I have surgical accuracy with chop stick but this brand they use were kicking my butt. With that said I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and I will be going back many times. Our waitress was also very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent! presentation is above and beyond anything I have seen in the Cleveland area. My bf (a former executive chef) and I, go out to eat sushi very often.  He lives in down town Cleveland, and while the downtown hipster joints have ambience, they cannot compare to Ninjas food presentation.  The owner apologized for the lack of a liquor license, but hey that just kept our bill cost down : )  The license is on its way we were told.  Prices are very good, again comparing with downtown pricing. Absolutely will be back and telling everyone about this pearl in the strip mall of oysters lol"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that some of the best sushi I would have would be around in a small town in Ohio. I was here visiting for a family gathering in Kirtland and based on other reviews tried this place out. Fresh, delicious, and the quality of the actual roll was top notch. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. My friend lives in mentor on the lake and said I had to go with him to try this place. I was really really impressed. I lived in LA for almost two decades and experienced some of the best sushi. I didn't realize a little place in a strip mall in ohio would have equally good food. The waitress was quite knowledgeable and kind and the fish was incredibly fresh. I was very pleased. I went back another time and was equally pleased. It is now my favorite sushi place to go to"}
{"text":"Ninja is a very pleasant surprise, as you would never think that high quality sushi at a fair price would be available in Mentor on the Lake.  I have been here three times now, and have never had an experience less than great.  I have had the miso soup, spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, the Ohio roll, and the spicy killer roll.  Their white rice is some of the best used in sushi I have ever had, adding much substance to each sushi roll with the perfect amount as to not cheapen the other flavors.  For instance, the mixed filling used in the spicy salmon roll is not mushy, but almost a creamy melt in your mouth sensation.  That mixed with the perfectly cooked rice makes for extreme texture balance.  Would recommend to any sushi lover, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to find a good sushi place around here in Cleveland. Probably the best sushi in Cleveland. Ordered eel, sogo maki, ninja maki, and spicy salmon."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi. Authentic and delicious. Prices are reasonable. Best place for sushi in Lake County!!"}
