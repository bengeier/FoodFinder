{"text":"Just moved in around the corner with my wife and was looking for some thai food. Wowza! So excited to find a legit thai place in our new neighborhood! Staff was very nice and got us to go stuff that was hot as Hades even when we got home. Expect more photos of these dishes from us, we're going back soon and often."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is not as packed as the other thai place my cousin and i used to go to (selfish reasons! Lol). Its a gem close to my work, the food taste amazing!! Everytime we come here we order the same thing, panang curry and pad thai. With each visit the food just got better and better. I would definitely recommed this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong having a meal at Ploy Thai Bistro. I have had take out several times and dined in for dinner as well. Seriously, they do not disappoint. Their Pad Thai is the best I have ever had (I ordered medium spicy and on different occasions ordered with chicken or shrimp) and my son raved about the Pad See Ew with pork. I recommend you start your meal with the Chicken Satay - the peanut dipping sauce is amazing. While the portions are large, we still managed to indulge in some dessert - the coconut cake was delicious!  So moist and light, order a slice to go, you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to stop in for lunch today at PloyThai and walked out very satisfied. The service was friendly and very attentive. We started out with the Miso which, while a little salty, was chock full of carrots, celery, onions, and chard. This will definitely be my go to the next time I'm feeling under the weather. The egg roll appetizers were crispy and delicious. In addition to the normal vegetables, there were tiny silver noodles inside giving it a nice texture. We ordered Pad Woon Sen, Chicken Chow Mein, and Orange Chicken for the table. The first two dishes were great. I especially loved the Pad Woon Sen. Noodles were cooked perfectly, fresh vegetables, and the flavor combinations on the Pad Woon Sen and Chicken Chow Mein were spot on - the plates were emptied quickly. I probably wouldn't order the Orange Chicken again. It didn't taste very fresh. My daughter insisted it was made with Kool-Aid but I think there was just a little too much orange marmalade.   All in all, a very nice experience. The restaurant is decorated very nicely. Clean and open space. Television inside and a big center table to accomodate group functions. They have a lunch menu and extended dinner one, as well. I, also, must thank them for being so sweet to my children. All the cups had the bendy straws, there was scrumptious coconut ice cream to end the meal and even my three year old, who wasn't in the best of moods, was smiling and asking more noodles once he tasted the chow mein.   Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Food is not the same as it was. Recipes are different with new ownership. There is an employee which carried over to the new ownership; but other than this, nothing else is the same. Anyone who says otherwise is related to the business.  Wow! Patrick N., you sound like you know a lot. Comments you make only show how little you really know. If you know so much, please tell"}
{"text":"Welp, I'm pretty satisfied with this place. It's right around the corner from me. When I need my thai fix, this place is perfect. Their curries are traditional. Not too shabby. All dishes are packed with flavor. Their spice levels are on point. The lady I always see up front is very nice and always smiling. Ploythai can definitely be my local thai bistro while I'm here. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Thai. We came in for his birthday to place a to go order. Service was great. Free wifi was offered. Most importantly, the food was really good! Everything was fresh. The heat level matched our order. We will be back, without a doubt!  We ordered shrimp tempura, green curry chicken and shrimp pad Thai. We could not finish it all, but we wanted to. So yummy!"}
