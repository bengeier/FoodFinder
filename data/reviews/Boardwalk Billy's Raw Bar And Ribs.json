{"text":"Boardwalk Billys is our favorite place to eat for two main reasons.  Sadie and Amanda. While the food is very good and the outdoor dining is the best in town, nothing beats being greeted like an old friend and valued customer.  It makes our day when we are greeted by Sadie who always has a big smile and a high energy personality that just lights a person up.  Amanda is awesome as a server.  The glass is never less than half full and she always remembers the little things such as additional bbq sauces for the bbq sandwich.  Barrett is the new GM and we have seen a huge difference in not only the food but also the staff.  We eat there a couple times a week and have always been taken well care of and leave totally relaxed and well fed."}
{"text":"Really love going here for lunch! The dinner menu is a little too pricey for me, but it's no more than T.G.I. Friday's or Cheddar's. The service is great and the food is even better. Plus you can't beat the view."}
{"text":"Good place.  A little more difficult to get to while road construction is going on.  I had a combo meal of wings, ribs, and sausage.  The sausage and wings were great.  The ribs were a bit tougher than I would have expected considering they were \"smoked\".   The coloring of the meat also brings the level of \"smoking\" into question with the ribs.  The place was nice the wings had a great flavor. It was like a medium citrus kind of flavor."}
{"text":"My first time in Charlotte, NC and I was there on business. My colleague and I decided on this place because it was near the hotel we were staying at. We had dinner here around 8pm on a tuesday, and it was sad to see how dead the area looked, even though it was a nice scenic view.   We shared the \"Southern Nachos\" that had smoked pulled pork, cheddar jack cheese, pico de gallo with cilantro lime sour cream sauce drizzled over the top. And of course, I added jalapenos.  This plate was soo huge, even for the two of us. I definitely recommend sharing with at least 4 people, otherwise, by the time your entree gets there you've filled up on nachos. Nothing wrong with that, but you'll miss out on the fabulous BBQ.   For my entree, I ordered the \"Q Combo\" which allows you to choose from their 2 or 3 smoked delights & two mouthwatering sides. I chose the link of smoked sausage and the 4 bone mini-rack. The sausage was good but not memorable. The mini ribs were fall off the bone which is great however it was lacking in flavors. I needed to drench it in bbq and hot sauce.   Overall, I thought it was a great casual place for the family."}
{"text":"Service is a joke. Our server look like he had been forced to be here.  15 mins after we ordered our first beer we finally got one and it was tapped. This place is a joke. Where the food is ok we aren't staying past apps. Bc of how we were treated.   Will not return do to bad food and crap service"}
{"text":"The place was packed when I went but they had room at the bar so I decided to sit there. They had some really good drink specials for happy hour, and it looked like each day has different drink specials for happy hour.   I ordered a chicken sandwich which was really really good. Much better than I expected from a place like this. The wait staff/bartenders were all great and very friendly. This is absolutely a place I'd go to again."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a long time. Great staff. Wonderful food. Sweet atmosphere. You can always meet new and interesting people and eat real good food. Check it out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was great! I loved how it was right on the lake. Very unique. I was here during the olympics, so seeing a different sport on every TV was awesome.   We came for appetizers and margaritas. We had the crab con queso and chicken fingers. Both were great. The crab con queso was some of the best I have had. I have had many cheese dips with crab that tasted fake, but this was rich and tasted fresh. The chips were crisp and fresh as well. The chicken fingers were skinny, but we loved them. I had ranch with them and it was some of the best ranch I have had at a restaurant.   The margaritas were pretty pricy ($11-15), but that is alcohol for you. It tasted good and it was a pretty good amount for the $. I will definitely be going back for $4 mimosas on Sundays!"}
{"text":"We walked to the entrance where a young woman was standing she informed us it would be about 30 minutes for our table of two to be seated. She was very delightful. They notified us about 15 minutes later. We walked in to the hostess she was busy talking and about a minute later she asked our name. She seated us we wait another three minutes for another young female to come over she walks up and asked our drink order. No hi my name is or anything. She brings us our drinks then walks off comes back five minutes later. You guys ready to order. Oh ok we place the order and she just walks off twirling in her hair. She didn't repeat the order or anything. About 20 minutes later another server comes and gives us our food. The burgers and fries were good and flavorful. The only reason it received two stars was because the food was really good. The service sucked for this to be our first time here. We'll try it again hopefully we won't get the same server."}
{"text":"The buffalo wings tasted dry....  Their mashed potato and gravy tasted old. The crab cakes was good except presentation sucked for $13.99.  The waitress was decent so that made up for it.  I'm not super impressed with this place, but I am willing to give it another try. Just not during dinner time"}
{"text":"9/17/12-Highlight of the meal was the local beer.  Server brought the wrong app (fried green tomatoes and crab cakes instead of just fried green tomatoes) and after we had already started eating it he showed up with our correct order and demanded that we give him the app. (My companion had already grabbed one of the crab cakes thinking it was a fried green tomato--yes, they were basically the same diameter and general color, just thicker.)   In my opinion you never take something away from the customer that was your mistake and an upgrade.  My concern here is that they are going to turn around and give the crab cake to someone else........In the end, it saved me several hundred calories from a crab cake that was more filler than crab.  BBQ chicken 4/5 Pulled pork 2/5 (bland and tasted like it was cooked several days ago and reheated for service...maybe even frozen ) fried green tomatoes 3/5 Fried pickles great novelty but a one time order 4/5 crab cake 1/5 my companion only took 2 bites and it definitely wasn't top quality."}
{"text":"Always good service and friendly staff. Nice local beer selection. My favorite bar in the area. Food is usually good and the wings are great."}
{"text":"Went to this restraunt last night. Service was terrible all around joke staff was down right terrible .the manager was drunk and getting an attitude . I will be sure to never return to this bar agin . also food was old and dry the wings were chewwy and over cooked. Also took me 20 mins to even get a second bud light. Stay away from this place if u want a good experience"}
{"text":"So if you want a good experience don't go to board walk Billy's its a total crap shoot staff treats you like shit managers are drinking all the time . if you want to have a good  time go somewhere else"}
{"text":"We meet here once a month after work for get togethers.  The staff is real nice and there are big screen TVs everywhere.  We get fried pickles, Sweet Potato fries, crab cakes, or the happy hour 5-7 shrimp or wings at $0.50 each in sets of 5!  The only complaint I have is that it is so noisy that we can hardly talk.  But then, I guess I am getting old too!"}
{"text":"Great people and cold beers. And the food is good too. Daily specials on food and drink."}
{"text":"This place always has great food and great drink specials! It caters mostly to the younger crowd, but you can still take your family here for a great meal during earlier hours. The only complaint I have about this place is the peanut shells all over the floor. It grosses me out a bit to step on them as I'm making my way around the bar. Other than the peanut shells this is a great place to have a drink and watch the game with some friends."}
{"text":"Came here last night as a late night dinner for 4...ended up super satisfied with their seafood! Ordered the Southern Nachos with Pork...the pork had amazing flavor! The rest of the nachos were pretty typical, over salted, over cheesed...but still quite good. My friend ordered the fish and chips; I ordered the fish and chips with shrimp. Shrimp was ok, but the fish was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! It was light and the flavor was amazing! The kids ordered the chicken baskets for kids, nothing amazing but they loved the chicken fingers. :o)  I cannot rave enough about that fish though! I have yet to have fish that light, and flavorful!   Service was lacking, but I don't think we had a seasoned waitress either. The service is why it got 4 stars instead of 5.   Price was great for what we had. It was $65 for the 4 of us. Not bad at all! Would so go there again and again for that fish!!"}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes, low country boil, crab queso, and really great sweet potato fries! Service was quick, friendly, and helpful. Priced reasonably, smaller meals offered, generous portions all the same."}
{"text":"This was my first time there. The service was good and the pulled chicken sandwich was so moist, tender and yummy! The sweet and spicy BBQ sauce topped it off. Our seats overlooking the water, within site of the TVs, was fabulous. I can't wait to go back. Oh, prices were good too."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is run by a bunch of comedians.  Last night when walking in I was asked for ID.  I am 60.  I had left my wallet in the hotel.  I explained I was British and didn't have to bother with that sort of thing. Nice bouncer with a sense of humour let me in and I enjoyed my meal and a few beers.  Why they gave me a wrist band when I wasn't in hospital eludes me.  Tonight I wander across again and am asked for a $5 cover.  None last night but $5 tonight.  I explained that all I wanted was something to eat although I did fancy a few beers as well. Ok. Says my nice bouncer friend who recognised me from last night. Go on in but you will have to get it to go.  Being a cheeky little 60 year old I snuck a beer whilst my food was prepared.  There were twice as many seats as the previous night and the 6 bartenders were serving no one.  My food arrived and I left.  Tastes good but no beer. My question to the manager or owner is who came up with this?    2 additional comments.  1 There was no live music playing which could have possibly justified the cover and  2. Why was o not ID'd tonight. Had North Carolina overnight declared it legal for 60 year olds to drink in its bars.  Had common sense prevailed   I wait with baited breath for an answer.!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place.  We have had good luck finding something everyone likes, and that is quite an accomplishment.  Its very casual and friendly staff makes you feel at home.  I have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I know you are right. You must be the same manager who told me your drink menu has a disclaimer that all drinks are final. So the truth is, I ordered without looking at the menu as I told you. I also told you anyone can have a bad day. SI if he has been there for 10 years, big deal. I still stayed, drank beer and the waitress who took care of me after was lovely. But the couple who was next to me, did not like the mixed drink they got from the same bartender who has been there over 10 years. So he may have had a bad nite or that is your standard of service. I leaned over and told them I had the same issue. They did not drink it and left shortly after. Your philosophy of walking past dollars to save pennies is not the best practice. But, you were not too helpful either. No matter what, I paid for all the drinks I received and ordered. But I have the right to post my experience and I have been honest. It is not a personal attack. It's a review of my experience."}
{"text":"crappy customer service, drinks suck had to pay $5.00 to get in because it was saturday night and the live band didnt show up...."}
{"text":"When we were in Charlotte we ate at both locations and have to say Boardwalk Billy's had absolutely the BEST raw oysters we ever had!  Hands down!!!  The oysters were fresh, not sandy AND they were \"released\" from the shell by the person who opened them. That is a big plus to half shell lovers. I had the Mahi Taco which was excellent and my husband had a burger which he really enjoyed.  The atmosphere was fun, very casual and the wait-staff friendly and attentive.  You should really give this restaurant a try even if you aren't into oysters & if you are an oyster lover you owe it to yourself to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome. The food on the other hand was a complete joke! Portions were small for how much they charge. I hope this was not the only BBQ representing Charlotte! Again the service was awesome but when I leave still hungry and spend over $10 bucks there is a problem."}
{"text":"Wow! Great service, excellent food and overall great experience. We were in town for a wrestling training and made our way over a few times. Everyone from the security staff to the bartenders were amazing. Even the regular customers were so helpful! Thanks Dave. If your here for any reason give this place a try. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Their Turkey Burgers are awesome I get grilled & fried onions on mines I only wish they had avocados to put on top. Reasonable prices for a super delicious burger. I mostly do take out. Need a better system for delivery pick ups but eat here at least 2 times a week"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying my server Amanda was great super friendly and attentive  My 3 stars are for the food... Pretty mediocre not terrible but not great Seems like a better hangout for the bar and drinks... And I'm not a snob I love to party and think this place could do both great bar and great food would be a winning combo"}
{"text":"I had a great NC lunch.   Fresh raw oysters, ribs, fried green tomatoes and Cole slaw.   It was great.   Ribs are so tender . . good sauce  . . Oysters are fresh . . $30 with Tip not bad . ."}
{"text":"Brought the fam here, we ordered the pots and burgers & fries...Delicious! Wait time was reasonable, the peanuts held is over until our food came. Our waitress was knowledgeable on what to order that helped since we had never eaten here before. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is average for bar food.  Beer selection average.  Long wait(1hr) for food so this is why it gets three stars."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere. Staff is very friendly. Great drink specials! Food is good, my personal favorites are crab queso, shrimp tacos, Boardwalk salad, and the smoking section is so delicious my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. I've been several times and never been disappointed. Almost everything they make is homemade from the desserts to the dressings, even the BBQ sauces that sit on the table. If your visiting Charlotte this place is a must visit! Ps the beer selection is huge and very diverse, my personal favorite is big boss high roller."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. Cold drinks, the crab dip was spicy and flavorful. Had the founder sandwich - great people size, prepared and presented well. Wife enjoyed her coconut shrimp. We would order everything again. Good noise level and a terrific view"}
{"text":"My wife and me went here to try the steam pots. The meal was awesome. The crab legs was some of the best we ever had. Not spicy at all. The waiters was really good too."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go!! Love the atmosphere, just sitting on the deck overlooking the lake. Night time is fun too with open mic on Wednesday nights with Jon Linker!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken wrap was bland and kind of grody. The fries were barely acceptable and tasted like they were fried in week-old grease. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Crab Queso and a cold beer and some vodka on special has always been my go to thursday night at the boardwalk.. great attentive staff with a great vibe.  Super huge resturant/bar with seafood avail!! Lots of great seafood. I love the boardwalk"}
{"text":"Food was fair, atleast hot, hard to find at 1 a.m..the problem for me is the staff...have tried several times to get a feel for the place...keep getting the same snobby attitude...will go in a pinch, but not my first choice.."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the shrimp and flounder basket. As well as the crab cakes. Very tasty. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. The quality of the food has declined over the years. The customer service is horrible. It's a 50-50 chance of having a good experience so save yourself the hassle and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I will never go back here ever again. Not only is the service here incredibly slow but the staff acts like every customer is a nuisance. I have been all over the world and this was the worst customer experience I have ever encountered. The way I was treated tonight this place is lucky its still open. Only people that would enjoy this place is if you enjoy sober ignorant racists and that is the straight up honest truth if you find yourself there from the hours of 9 pm till close"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, Clint's a good man! He takes care of us every time, he has a very warm personality."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the experiences were great. But I had a bad experience with a server Megan. She was short, rude, and even went on to say not to \"look at her boyfriend\". It was very unprofessional and rude. Quite frankly, I didn't trust her with my food afterward. Other than that, go enjoy! Just don't get Megan for your waitress."}
{"text":"Disappointed with food.  I stopped in on Fathers Day 2017.  My wife and I ordered fried green tomatoes which were pretty good.  My wife had the low country boil and I had the shrimp tacos as recommended by our waitress.  The tacos were supposed to be soft flour tortillas but came to the table dry, hard and cracking with every attempt to bite.  The shrimp was not seasoned and the slaw lacked flavor.  The low country boil was dry.  Really, food that was supposedly slow boiled came out dry and tasted microwaved, especially the corn and sausage.  The atmosphere left me not even wanting to go back as many other tables seemed bored with their selections as well."}
{"text":"This Boardwalk Billy's is perched over a little pond with ducks.  It kind of feels like you have been transported to Florida.  It is located within a nice shopping area north of Charlotte (near UNCC).  The food is standard bar fare with a definite leaning towards seafood.  I had the fish tacos with mango salsa and they were delicious.  They have drink specials every night of the week and tap beers are affordable every day ($3 for Yuengling).  They seem to have a regular line up of live music.  It feels like a good spot to grab a few drinks, an affordable meal, and relax for a while.  The wait staff was all female (from what I could tell) and super sweet - referring to me as \"honey.\"  The crowd is diverse - a mix of ages and ethnicities.  Nothing too special about the place (besides the pond) but still a solid option!"}
{"text":"First time here so my thoughts may chance if I do come again. I came here with the wife to check this place out Since we were in the area. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the fried green tomatoes. The sandwich was satisfactory with a very Carolina style BBQ sauce. If you don't know what that means, it has heavy vinegar notes. The fried green tomatoes sucked. They were the equivalent to ordering the onion rings from BK Lounge. My wife ordered the 1/2 chicken which was good and again like me made the mistake of getting the tomatoes. If we do come back it will probably be purely be for drinking. As far as wait staff I give them a C+"}
{"text":"Several items were not prepped overnight, so they weren't able to be ordered. Brisket was dry. Baked beans made pork & beans look 5 star. Save your money."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am a regular here and the place always has friendly staff. The food is pretty decent depending on what you get. You can't go wrong with the seafood here. You get a pretty diverse crowd too which makes for good people watching. The patio is nice too when the weather is nice. I highly recommend this place. A++"}
{"text":"Went last night to have a girls night out and I order the \"purple fishbowl\" $22! Now for the size great deal but 2 of us drank the whole thing and I felt like I spent $22 on some kool-aid!  How nice at the bottom of the menu as I was looking back it says all sales final! What a rip off. The waitress was very kind and I even allowed her to try it and she said she didn't taste any liquor but yet there's suppose to be 12 shots in this thing! Now I'm now a heavy drinker so I did expect to get at least a little buzz. I guess looking at how dead the place was it should've told me something! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"For what it is, I think it's good. It's a sports bar! I don't know what some of the people on here want  out of this place. The food is good and there's always a game going on somewhere. I really like their turkey burgers! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great area. Water front view. Not bad for bar food. Good vibes. Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming experience. Bad service, below average food. The location was great but you would be better off going somewhere else on the boardwalk."}
{"text":"Great place to catch NFL on Sunday.  Good selection of drafts on tap.  I like the chicken tenders in honey lime buffalo"}
{"text":"Boardwalk Billy's is consistently good. We come here often because our kids like it and we are addicted to the hushpuppies. The service is pretty good here. They are well staffed and if you do have to wait for a table it moves pretty quick. We ordered the crab dip and the turkey burgers, they both were good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was tasty and the servings were large. I ordered ribs with two sides and couldn't finish it. The atmosphere was good too. There was a live band that didn't seem to play much more than warmup riffs. After about 30 minutes, they did manage to play a couple of songs. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed. It took her a while to come and check on us after we received our food so we were without extra napkins, BBQ sauce and sweetener for our tea for a while. We never received refills until she came to ask if we were ready for the check. The cost was great though. Full meals for two and a crab cake basket with drinks for less than $60."}
{"text":"Feels like a neighborhood bar - you can bring the kids or have fun with just adults.  Very casual.  I always get the Jerk Chicken salad with balsamic dressing, very good.  But all the food is good - yummy, unhealthy bar food.  Have had the ribs, burgers, and son loves the chicken kids meal served in a cool paper ship.   Beers on tap are good and specials are always good too.   Service is usually great, sometimes not so great, but we always go back.  Daughter loves the cup cakes."}
{"text":"Ehh... I was craving oysters after work and used yelp to search some places in the area. I completely understand that Charlotte is no where near fresh oysters, but I've had some good ones in the area. Here... I'll pass. Maybe they get them out of the pond beside the business. The mojito was good and the pimento cheese was good. (Probably because it was palmetto brand) I'll skip this place and drive to Concord for Full Moon. I was also expecting more seafood on the menu, but this is a bar with seafood options at best. Thank you Yelp for the 10% off my bill and 7% cash back."}
{"text":"BoardWalk Billy's  This was a Great place 2 Eat.  We had gd service right from the beginning. Their Peanuts R 2 Die 4 ! Yup I had a lot b4 the meal. Wish I could hv ck'd out their Bar Scene, but we were there for lunch. Shrimp Ribs Corn. Mahalo Susie Q"}
{"text":"server needed help with our group of 15. a very large part was in the back room and they took a lot of attention from the staff. frustration was the look on faces at other tables. We were ok because we were talking and celebrating a friends bday."}
{"text":"This place is great. Clint and Pete made me the most phenomenal drinks on my 21st birthday. Josh made sure to check my ID and he was really good at it.  I will definitely be returning to boardwalk Billy's. I even liked Joshs beard. Make sure to try the wild watermelon!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area pretty much all my life, and even worked across from here for a couple of years and have never walked in here until tonight. I came here with my girlfriends. We were seated as soon as we walked in. We waited for five minutes, with no server to greet us. My friends and I all used to wait tables, so we understood if he/she couldn't come immediately, so I gave a five minute limit before we decided to walk out. The server had 30 seconds to spare before the five minutes was up (talk about lucky!) before greeting us. My friends and I ordered drinks and split a pulled pork nachos. I had shared some blue bowl drink (can't remember the drink's name). It was really good, with a delicious coconut note to it. However, definitely too much ice. The melted ice diluted the alcohol that it ended up tasting like juice. The nachos were absolutely delicious. The server (can't remember her name) had redeemed herself from the long wait before coming to us. She was funny, friendly, and consistently came to check on us (we were there for a couple of hours). I absolutely recommend this place for some drinks and bar food on the patio!"}
{"text":"Lost my business after two visits!   I had two really bad experiences here.  First we had a bar tender on a Sunday night who didn't pay a group of 4 people getting multiple drinks any attention.  Then the next day my boyfriend noticed an extra charge for the tip on one of the bills.  He called and complained and didn't need anything out of it but a manager said to come back they'd have a gift card for him.    So two Sunday's later we went back. Ready to give it another chance.   The manager was too nice and gave us the gift card. It was the same group of four people at the bar for drinks.   Same bar tender.... Who made delicious drinks this time and was super personable and fun to be around.... Until he talked to another manager.  Which was really sad because he was doing a way better job than last time.  Delicious drinks and way more attention. Maybe the other week had a bad day? You never know what another person is going through.  But then hmm talked to a man who was another manager who told him we needed cut off after our next round of drinks.    There were 4 people.  Two couples.  Both bills around $50 and 4 people willing to continue to give our business because we were enjoying the bar, the environment/atmosphere and the drinks.    They cut us off.  With around $50 checks with mixed drinks that cost about $7 or so dollars each? That's about 3 or 4 drinks per person.  No reason to be cut off.    And from now on they have lost my business at that location."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for an impromptu lunch outing and I we started our with the crab queso and it was very, very delish! I ordered the shrimp tacos w/ fries and ohmygooooodness-- so good!! My hubby got the fried flounder sandwich and it was HUGE!! Two, large pieces of flounder on top of a hoagie! Definitely filling! He couldn't even eat it all! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Walk up and they ask for ID in a very abrupt, uber-bouncer way. Must be 21 to eat here. This family of 4 with minors left immediately. RUDE."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. They were really busy and we were a large group but the hostess made it happen. We sat outside on the deck and the kids loved it. It was a little hot and the umbrellas were lacking (the fan was too loud and obnoxious). Our waitress was on the ball. Im so sorry I forgot her name. She was young and very good.  Our fishbowl was tasty (not watered down like most), food was so good and came out fast. The kid meals were adorable! A paper boat the kids carried and played with for days. Great presentation! We ordered the flounder sandwich (it was huge!), brisket nachos (OMG!) and lots of shrimp (perfectly cooked)."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is great and the drinks can be cheap if you get what's on special- however the bouncers are total a-holes! So I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon even though I love the atmosphere once I'm inside..."}
{"text":"Nice Location.  Utterly forgettable food.  Insanely slow service.  The place was slow and the waiters just could not have cared less about our group.  Sort of unreal."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. They have a good menu and a good atmosphere, a nice view by the water. I thought brisket dinner would be safe. The plate shows up and everything fills up the plate but by the time I start cutting away at it, about half the brisket plate was just fat. The presentation looked nice but the portion, by the time I finished I was still hungry. Coming here felt like I could stuff money in a sock and cut a hole in it or tape up the sock and leave. So that's what I did and don't plan to be back."}
{"text":"We like to go to this Boardwalk Billy's over in the Matthews area on Fridays or Saturdays after a long work week.  It's a nice, casual place to go as a couple or with kids and just hang out.  One of my favorite things is the salted peanuts in the shell waiting for me when I get seated.  YUM.  What a fantastic appetizer.  I try not to think about anybody's hands other than my own touching them before they were placed on the tables.    I'm a sucker for spicy stuff, so I always go for the Buffalo Chicken Wrap or Buffalo Chicken Salad, both with Super Hot or Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Both are good, nothing unique about them or probably any menu items at Boardwalk Billy's, but they're reasonably priced, taste good, and we enjoy the laid back atmosphere.  There's usually some beer on special any night we visit, so I like to wash down the spice with a cold brewski.    The only downside to BB is the smoking.  People smoke at the bar and it wafts over to the tables.  Even if you're sitting outside, you can't escape the smoke from the tables surrounding you.  But, hey, it's a bar.  I mostly expect that.  We get out of Boardwalk Billy's relatively cheap and with full stomachs.  The kids enjoy the (one) free arcade game, so that gives us a breather to enjoy the beer(s) a little longer..."}
{"text":"My 2 star is literally only for the one dish I ordered which was the seafood boil. Was supposed to be boiled in a butter garlic type sauce but it was just flavorless water. I paid 2 dollars extra for flavorless sausage slices. It came with 3 oysters, which I'm not sure why because I could eaten each one with a toothpick since there was literally no oyster in the shell. We also ordered the crab con queso dip which was what I can only assume to be a melted chunk of velvita with crab chunks in it. My wife ordered the shrimp tacos which were pretty good which is why I was so disappointed that my boil was so bland. I'm sure the actual meat they serve like the brisket etc is probably really good. So the next time I go back I will stay clear of the rawbar menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer last week and a appetizer. The beers were cheap and the appetizers were pretty good for your standard \"bar food\". I kinda doubt I'd go back for a full on meal because the place looks a little run down but if you are in the mood to watch football, eat peanuts and tie one on. You are in the right spot. Also, it seems to be more of a country bar type location so if you are in to that check them out on one of the nights they have a band playing. The servers are also very friendly and prompt about taking your orders."}
{"text":"Boardwalk Billy's is consistently mediocre. They don't try to do anything fancy, and they do a fine job of it. Their food is simple American fare: hamburgers, chicken fingers, mayonnaise, etc. Not gourmet, not well presented, not Earth-shatteringly tasty, but fast, cheap, and always good enough to enjoy.  This is par for the course at a University City lunch joint."}
{"text":"I came here sometime last week to kill time before going to work. Always passed by this place whenever I'm at this shopping center. Nothing spectacular, but the food I ordered satisfied my taste buds. My waitress was good. They have a good lunch menu overall."}
{"text":"We've only been living in Charlotte since the end of April and we've been to this place 8-10 times-it's THAT good. Everyone who visits us gets a trip to BB's. From the fried pickles, fried green tomatoes, and nachos to the crab legs, smoked ribs and wings-everything is amazing. Not one complaint. Great food, great service, and a very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Checked in here on Sunday with family.  The weather was perfect....sunshine and blue skies.  We were seated at an outside table so that we could enjoy the weather along with our food.  We received great service and the food did not disappoint.  Two of us had the crab legs and the other person had the peel and eat shrimp.  I am a crab leg lover and must say I was thoroughly satisfied.  The corn on the cob that accompanied the crab legs was delicious. I knocked that it first so that I could give my undivided attention to my crab legs.  Every time we eat at Billy's it is a rewarding experience.  My first time here was during a visit to Charlotte a few years ago.  We have since relocated here and Billy's is one our favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"I love the Boardwalk Billy's by Matthews, but this University one was a bit dingy and worn (like an old pair of socks) the last time I was there.  It was early in the evening on a weekend before the weekend crowds started to get there.  The sun was still out, so I was able to see everything in the restaurant as light poured in from the big glass windows.  Everything felt so dirty from the floor to the table to the sticky menu.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad night, but I haven't been back since.    The food was just as good as the Matthews one, and I still love the peanuts in the shell on the table, but I was a little afraid of where they'd been after seeing the rest of the restaurant in disarray.    The University Boardwalk Billy's has great prices and a prime location on the mini lake with a lot of great outdoor seating, so I hope they'll -- literally -- clean up their act."}
{"text":"Husband got food poisoning from ribs we suspect? He was violently ill after we left. Tried calling 2 times to speak to manger to warn them or ask for advice...put on hold and hung up on. Let it go. But will not return. Jerk chicken sandwich had no flavor at all where is the Jerk? Waitress was friendly and excellant service. Food was aweful.  Took husband 8 hours to feel better was very sick. He threw away leftovers in fear they would make him sick again.  He never gets I'll stomache made of steel. So something was not right about ribs. Gave 2 stars for great service. 0 for food."}
{"text":"Boardwalk Billy's location is prime; you get to eat with a view.  Its in the university area of JM Keynes; if you're familiar with the area, its where the Hilton is & the giant pond.    The food is alright; I like the blackened chicken pita & the chicken fingers.  They have free peanuts at the table, try not to fill up on them!  If you like ranch, they have pretty good homemade tasting ranch.  I typically go at lunch & they throw in a free sweet tea.    The service is good; mostly college kids working there.  Today we were served by Kelsey; she was super sweet & let us know about downloading their app for deals, including free lunch.   You can't beat free food.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great sandwich for take out last night. Pulled smoke chicken w/ pepper jack cheese added bacon. Get the fries add siracha seasoning. Bar staff always great, locals hang out, cool bar atmosphere. Ashton is great."}
{"text":"The service and food was really good. The drinks were great and the service very friendly. Kristina and Clint were behind the bar and although it got busy they made sure were taken care of. I highly recommend this place and will be back again when in the area. Def get the ribs!!!"}
{"text":"A cool place to get a beer, right on the lake.  The food is marginal at best.  Drink specials daily.  As of recently they have added a lot of microbrews to their selection.  May make it a 4 star, but not convinced yet."}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed my experience. Had a bit of a wait, but I enjoyed my rum bucket or whatever it was called, and I loved my BFW (burger, fries, wings) boc. The burger was good and the wings are excellent. Loved the fries too. My server was on point, but they might need training on up-selling. But, no complaints, only compliments! Keep it up, Billy's! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very laid back restaurant/bar. Great wings and seafood options! The service is great. Lots of teamwork. The management is awesome and I can tell they get along great with their employees. They always have drink specials. They have live music on some nights. I def recommend this place if you want something quick and laid back."}
{"text":"Fourth visit here and yet to be disappointed !! I usually get a peach, mango or berry mango daquiri and smothered fries for an app! I absolutely LOVE them! I recent tried the crab dip which was also quite yummy. It's not overly \"crab\" and has a spicy kick to it. I then usually get the combination of crab legs and steamed shrimp. Yum yum. I have also had the chicken tender salad And their burgers and wings!!! I recommend this restaurant and I will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food & great drinks! Garrett is always my server and he is the best!"}
{"text":"As a person that isn't the biggest fan of seafood I thought the menu had a good bit of options and I found the food to be enjoyable! I would say that the waitress was not super attentive and I found that I was wondering where she was most of the time. Other than that I would say it was a good experience with a pretty view of the water!"}
{"text":"Jill was or sever and was amazing! She recommended new and different beers all night long and she kept our glasses full! Great place with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went in for the 4$ flavored vodka special on Tuesday. We had the crab con queso and it was delicious. I would recommend to anyone that wants to have a few drinks without spending too much. Kendall was our waitress and she was great. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Saw The Panther's playoff game here.  The beer was great.  Atmosphere was great.  No problem watching the game.  Food was good!  My bill was great!  In better words, under  $25. for myself and tip was included."}
{"text":"The perfect complement to a long day of height-conquering fears, crawls through barbed wire and jumps over flaming coals! lol I suppose I should clarify that we did the Warrior Dash in Huntersville prior to coming to Boardwalk Billy's =P  Our group consisted of 6 people and the staff was very accommodating. The wait was not long at all! Our waitress was very sweet. She consistently checked on our group despite the busy crowd that typically flocks a Sunday afternoon.  I don't normally care for bar food and mainly chose this place for the view. The relaxing lake view is always the perfect ending to a long day. I've been to Boardwalk Billy's a few times, but I tried a different dish this time and was pleasantly surprised. I had Grilled Shrimp Tacos, which is mango BBQ shrimp on flour tortillas. I traded one of my tacos for my friend's Blackened Mahi Taco. I got the shorter end of the stick since the Grilled Shrimp Tacos are SO MUCH BETTER! Should have just kept mine, no tradesies next time! ...jk =P Definitely try them though if you stop by!"}
{"text":"Loved them when I went. Their raw oysters on the half shell are large and great with lemon and Tabasco."}
{"text":"Good drink specials. Been there for lunch and dinner and it seems like the lunchtime cooks and servers do a better job. Overall decent place."}
{"text":"I spent a weekend in Charlotte and figured I'd try a local spot that has some seafood- I always go for the seafood. We opted to try Boardwalk Billy's. I'll start by saying the service was slow and the food was... eh. The drinks were decent, although I think I would have enjoyed them more if they were a tad bit heavier on the liquor. The basket of peanuts was a cool touch. It was something to munch on while we waited what felt like forever for our food to arrive.   Once it did arrive, it was \"ok\". We ordered the ultimate steam pot and the private party. The former was said to have been cooked in a garlic and white wine broth. The flavoring was bland. The butter that was served with both dishes must have been unsalted. It seemed watered down and had no flavor. When you eat steamed crab, while crab legs are good, the butter adds for that extra flavor. Not here. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was great! It isn't 5 star seafood, but it doesn't claim to be.  It's great food for the money.  The coconut shrimp appetizer was just ok. But the entrees were delicious.  My wife ordered ribs and I had the steam pot.  The ribs were cooked just right and flavored well.  I swapped out the oysters in my steam pot for an extra cluster or crab legs and more shrimp.  Crab legs were outstanding and the shrimp were delicious.  We were also seated outside on the deck overlooking the water, so the ambience was nice also.  Great service, good price.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and enjoy their food and drinks. I highly suggest u try them out, the pond area is a little dirty but it's not their fault. They get my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Pass on this place. Food is mediocre at best. Atmosphere leaves much to be desired. Clientele make this place less tolerable."}
{"text":"Smoked wings tasted like burnt pork ribs with no flavor.  Sweet potato fries and the sweet muster like sauce was good.  Sauce for wings were very watery.  Sweet chili wings were a little better than the smoked ones.  Overall I am giving 2 starts because it took over 40 min to get our food."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in the university area but I was very pleased with this location. We sat on the patio and watched the game. Our server was very prompt and nice. I ordered the shrimp in mild sauce with sweet potato fries. The mild sauce was way to vinegary for me. The fries were excellent with honey mustard!! I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"A great place to catch the panthers game,and cheap cheap cheap food.  The environment is a friendly one and the people (not just employees) just know how to support their local team.  Be sure to show up early because the bar fills up really fast, as well as the tables around it! I was there for 4 hours and only spent $16! Oh and I have to mention the delicious beer. On game days you can order a personal pitcher for $5 which if you don't know, its about 2 to 3 beers.  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Boardwalk Billys has been a landmark for me as a UNC Charlotte Alum for quite sometime. Used to come here pretty regularly as a student and the drink specials were always good for a guy trying to scrunge-by on nickel and dimes.   Now-a-days, as it still close to \"the office\" I find myself wandering in here now and then for lunch. Now, the food was never bad before, but for whatever reason I never really ate here. But in any case, I was fairly impressed with the quality of what I ordered- Jerk Chicken Pita. It really hit the spot. Others at my table also had pretty decent meals off their lunch special menu. It is definitely worth coming out for a trail run of this place.  The atmosphere is great, nice interior with large bar. It is right on the man-made lake area and has an outside deck that protrudes the water. Great for nice weather days/ nights.   I'd imagine they still have local talent come out on the weekends, playing covers of decent songs. Drink specials have probably increased with the times since I've drank here, but I'd assume they are still competetive."}
{"text":"The staff is pretty decent and the food comes real fast.  The price is decent and they have a great selection of beer and other alcohol beverages.   The food tastes pretty good and it's a great portion. But it's not the best BBQ I have tasted. It is more vinegar base than ketchup based.  The ribs are tender and it is well marinated.   Also, one of the plus side is they do have a patio and it is pet friendly at the patio:)"}
{"text":"Boardwalk Billy's while a popular college bar during the evenings is a staple of area work lunch venues. Though they have a variety of fried options, a good burger, and my coworker swears by the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (with Frank's Hot Sauce, Fries, and 2 orders of blue cheese dressing), what will surprise you here is the variety of their healthy options. Instead of fries, swap out for steamed vegetables! They have a ground turkey burger and what is quickly becoming my favorite is their grilled chicken salad with Mandarin oranges, candied walnuts and dried cranberries.  The atmosphere is very laid back with staff in shorts & peanuts in baskets at each table shelled to the floor. On spring days the patio outback is perfect for the mid afternoon office escape."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent staff and even though we had to wait - the hostess staff really was helpful and kept us up to date. I liked having the mobile updates for our table wait time. The selection of beer was good, the view was nice and we enjoyed the atmosphere a lot! They did close off the front doors after 9pm and started entry access to the bar through security after that, so I don't know that it is like late at night. We'd definitely stop in again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Good bbq pulled pork entree; the lunch portion was huge! We had some fried pickles as well.. Not the best, they were a little soggy. Had a top shelf margarita as well.. It was a bit on the strong side, but it did the job! Awesome view through the big windows, reminds me of restaurants back home in south fla by the beach."}
{"text":"I thought this was a nice restaurant.  Definitely has a college feel to it, with loud music, sports on all screens, and a younger clientele.  Drink options were pretty good, and the drink specials were very affordable.  I enjoyed my food, and the service was quick.  Also, it's a great location on the boardwalk with plenty of outdoor dining options.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Truly a University Area Classic...  I've been coming to Boardwalk Billy's (or B-Dub's or B-Walks) for years, and its good to know that this place has lasted long enough to become a must for any UNCC student looking for a good time.  PROS:  *Above average bar food. The chicken tenders are awesome!  *Great drink specials almost every night of the week.  *Plenty of outdoor seating available, with splendid views overlooking the pond/lake.  *Service is very friendly, and willing and able to chat it up with you if you like.  *Free, all you can eat PEANUTS!  CONS:  *Parking can be tight, esp on Thursday nights.  *Usually there is a $5-$10 cover on Saturday nights.  They say it's because they usually have a band playing on Saturday nights.  Screen game is well below par, and not good for watching big sporting events.  *Also they don't carry any fights or special packages such as MLB or Sunday ticket.    NEUTRALS:  *HEAVY COP presence throughout the parking lot.  *Strong UNCC/college presence on most nights.  *Bar can be tight on their bigger nights.  Boardwalk's is a must if you are looking for local flavor within the University Area.  However, if you are not in the University Area, don't make any specials trips to go to the University Area just for B-Walks."}
{"text":"Great food and even a more reasonable price. If you need a suggestion for an appetizer get the crab con queso . Add a lil on my burger. Will never eat burgers the same way again."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar atmosphere with good barbecue. Laid back bartenders were attentive and pleasant. Good draught beer selection at reasonable prices. Several TVs throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed the perfect pulled pork, all but falling off the bone ribs and added a crabcake.  Sides were excellent fried green tomatoes and okay slaw. Too much food? Yes. I especially liked that there were 4 distinctly different sauces for the smoked meats. Eastern (more vinegar), Western (tomato based) and South (strong mustard influence). I eschewed the Sweet & Sassy as it's generally not for me.  The setting is great with an outdoor patio (too cold tonite)overlooking a nice pond. All in all - a bodacious dinner for me.  I will add that the prices are very kind to the wallet."}
{"text":"Been here three times so far, first time was just for a drink, we had to get carded and pay a cover, so I thought it would be a happening spot. Unfortunately, that was not the case for a place so close to a college. Went back for lunch on a football Sunday, got seated fairly quick and the food was good and came out fast for being a busy Sunday. Just had dinner the other night and food was fast and good.  The servers are younger people, probably from the school near by, which is fine, but the one I had last time I was there seemed to want to be somewhere else. I completely understand this, and we have all been there, but at least smile!    Overall, food was good, lots of beers and drinks on the menu, lots of specials through out the week, and plenty of TVs for game day."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner. Food was good , but staff could use a little attitude adjustment. Overall everything was to be expected."}
{"text":"This establishment is a solid choice for a quick meal, especially if you're interested in watching a sporting event. I've had the Buffalo chicken wings on a few visits. They're very good wings for a southern establishment. (I hail from Western NY.)  I have always found the service agreeable and accommodating. Each time I've visited for dinner it's been with a bigger group including small children. The atmosphere is loud, so kids blend in. On Sunday's they tag the TVs with team logos, so you know which games are playing where--helps with the seating selection.  It's fun place with tasty food and good drinks."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is quite pleasant overlooking the boardwalk and man made lake. The inside is clean and has adequate spacing between tables making for a nice dining experience. It can be a little loud but what else do you expect from a college restaurant.  Food:  I ordered the Buffalo wings touted by Boardwalk Billy's as being the \"best in Charlotte\". I wouldn't go as far as to say that but they were quite good with a nice crispy crust and and a flavorful sauce. The real standout of our meal was the \"Crab con Queso\" dip, a crab dip made with a cheese base with a slight spice to it, absolutely loved it.  Service:  We had a new waiter but I guess even the new waiters at this place are good. Our drinks were never empty and he wasn't intrusive but always made sure we were okay every so often.  Definitely would recommend to a friend! Only downside is that it's a little rough on the wallet if you're on a college budget."}
{"text":"When did they renovate Boardwalk Billy's? I haven't been here is years, mostly becuase the food was mediocre and the restaurant itself was a bit run down on the inside. A few friends decided to come here to grab some food and drinks. I was hesitant but came anyway. Much to my surprise, Boardwalk Billy's has grown up. The restaurant had a new look on the inside and it was clean. And the food was good. Our server was great too. I ordered the Boardwalk Salad, steamed shrimp and a side of fries. Everything was good, even the salad. I think they also expanded their selection of beers. Not sure when this happened bit they offer craft beers and sours now. And they have drink specials multiple days of the week. So I may be back to Boardwalk Billy's in the future to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Caleb Register was a very attentive and helpful server, giving us suggestions on our beer and food choices. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Our table was right by the water so we had a pretty view. We started off with some fried green tomatoes and of course some fried pickles. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and I have no complaints. Food was good, the beer was cold. They also have flights of beer so you can try the different brews they have on tap. I just stuck to a blue moon. I would like to come back here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong coming here for happy hour. Decent draft specials. Appetizers are good size and a burger combo with fries and wings or fingers is what I'd consider bargain basement."}
{"text":"the service was terrific! our server was attentive and polite and smiling! the floor was gross, not because of peanut shells, there was food and crap everywhere. yuck and an even bigger yuck.... they must have a very cheap chicken wing supplier because they don't bother to burn off the hairs that are on chicken wings and drums. There's hair poking out all over the place and yes, that is where I get put off. UGH.  The mashed potatoes were ok, if not cafeteria like. the best part of our visit were the hushpuppies. They were yum and the fried green tomatoes were good."}
{"text":"Maybe it is because our hometown doesn't have good seafood (or at least any I've found), but we found the seafood at this restaurant to be utterly delightful.  It isn't cheap but most seafood isn't.  The shrimp were spiced on point and the rest of the meal was seasoned well.  I saw that they have live music later in the evening.  Looks like they do charge cover charges at times.  Might want to do call ahead seating or reservations and check on their specials."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a half of dozen oysters and then the smoked wings with mango bbq sauce. The wings were nice and Smokey and vey juicy. Our main meals were the coconut shrimp that had very good flavor but were a little greasy. Also had the shrimp tacos. They were very good. Server was very good as well"}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff. The bar is always fun but sometimes they have a guy \"DJ-ing\" on Tuesday that can be a little much.  Try the smoked wings and sit on the patio when it is nice out."}
{"text":"Great environment and view.  Nice for families as well as childless adults.   Very clean.  Great service.  We were addressed right away and seated quickly.   The tables were well organized and utensils clean.  There is a great view of the lake if you ask for it.    The food was very good.  The kids really enjoyed it. I order the Q combo and choose chicken wings and ribs. So good.  And the portion was huge. The hush puppies were delish.  I had a side of mashed potatoes Erich were also good.   Everyone at the table enjoyed their food.     The waiter, forgot his name, was very good.   Young African American man with braids from Virginia. That's all I remember, but that he was professional, polite and efficient.   All the servers and staff seemed to be good.   I recommend this for anyone visiting the area.   It's in a nice outdoor shopping center with activities by a lake."}
{"text":"Was in the UNCC area for the first time with a couple friends in which they took me here for dinner. Place is located right on the lake so outside seating had a really nice view when we were there, nice and breezy, sun was setting which gave a really nice feel to be here. Granted it was a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant had a large amount of customers dining. As for the menu, typical bar food.   Some friends ordered a dozen half-shelled oysters. Quite good I have to say. Plump, great taste and didn't have a seafood smell. I would've preferred if the oysters were a slightly more chilled, but that's a personal preference. They were a good size and went down smooth. So if you're a fan of oysters, I'd say try it.   I personally had the mahi tuna taco with a side of apples. The quality was alright at best. I can't rave much about it as a friend had the grilled shrimp tacos and I must say those were better. With the mahi, it's served in a flour tortilla with diced tomatoes, slaw, pico de gallo and cilantro lime sauce. Just add a twist of more lime and I say it's a decent meal to wind down too. Not overfilling and not heavy also.   Another friend had an order of crab cakes which I would've rated 4.5 out of 5. Nice flavor and good texture. I think it was a tad heavy on the breading which takes away from the crab flavor, but to each his own. He loved it, so it works out.   There was also a order of perfect sunset fish bowl that was ordered. It came in a short plastic pitcher almost which was interesting. Personally, I don't drink alcohol but this thing didn't even have the taste of alcohol as if it didn't have any at all. Couple sips and I mainly tasted pineapple juice. Maybe the alcohol is at the bottom? Stirred around a bit, nope. Still all juice. Kinda disappointed on this one.   But if I were to rave about one thing this restaurant, would be the service. I forgot to ask for her name, but she was amazing. While seated outside on the patio, she checked up on us frequently, made good recommendations, and joked around. It made the dining experience that much better.   So my first experience with this restaurant and the city of Charlotte was very positive. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"First time here.  Wasn't sure which beer to order (great selection) and my server offered to bring me a sample of the two I was trying to decide between.  Lovely patio on the water. Perfect Sunday afternoon ambiance.  Ordered ribs and wings.  Ribs were  fall of the bone tender wings crisp and flavorful.  Sides were not that great.  Fried green tomatoes had too much breaking-beans okay.  Service was spotty-wanted another beer and waited longer than I should have.  Good bar/wings type place, don't be in a hurry.  Is a family place-lots of well behaved children.  I would go back"}
{"text":"My granddaughter is a little picky so this is a spot she likes to go out to dinner.  The food was very good especially the fried green tomatoes.  We had fast service even though it appeared to be busy. The Jamaican Jerk Chicken is a very good option. It is a little sweeter than other jerked chicken that I've eaten but still good not too spicy."}
{"text":"If anyone tells you that this place is not a top 20 contender for best wings in the area, they are lying to you. And, the seafood was fresh and flavorful. The waiter was friendly and joked with us without being overly personal or intrusive. Our drinks were good, and the atmosphere fit the restaurant's vibe. Service was timely and efficient."}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place. From the rambunctious customers to the attentive staff, this is a great place to bring friends, excited kids, and even grandparents.   Now to the food... I got the Buffalo Shrimp in the Mango BBQ sauce. It was so yummy. The menu is basic, nothing screamed at me. The drinks were ok, I've definitely had better.   I would come back with my girlfriends, if only for that mango sauce and the feeling I get being on the boardwalk. Next time, I think I'll try the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Oh Billy Bobs....I just don't know where to begin. My (Lois) experience started out with good service and anticipation for a tastey treat. My friend, Pat, and I were given food that was not what we ordered. When our server was searched for near and far, she was no where to be seen. We mentioned the mix up to another srever and they took our food to the kitchen. Soon after, our original server came marching up to our table pointing at what she wrote down for our orders, claiming that there was no mix up. After telling her what we (Lois and Pat) wanted (again) she went to the kitchen and brought back our food. The rest of the time she was a big meanie and made us feel bad about correcting her mistake. I hyped up Billy's to my friend, Pat, and was so excited to share the experience, but we left with a little bit of hurt feelings and a frownie face :("}
{"text":"Boardwalks Billy's is a good environment to eat in, it's a clean restaurant as well, nice waiters as well, BUT..... they take about 1 hour to deliver food ! Wish they could serve your food faster but the food is a good solid 9 /10 ! Would I recommend this place yes ! But definitely should come and try yourself ! I recommend the brisket and the sweet potatoe fries btw !"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4 Service-5 Food-4 Strikeouts-0/3  Either I was really hungry after landing on my flight here, or this place was impressive for what it was. My expectations were really low. Why? It's a seafood/BBQ/bar food place with tons of variety. This leaves me he question of whether the quality was there.   This places looks like any sports bar, which isn't what I expected before I walked in. The place was very icky maybe from the heat or just dried up beer. I just wanted some oysters to eat since it's pretty much the only place in the local vicinity that would serve it.  My server was pleasant and extremely efficient. I sat down with the menu, and narrowed it down to two in-house specialties and she was quick to help me decide what to order. Typically, I would get waitresses that ask for a drink order and then come back and then ask for the order of food. She did it all at once knowing that I only wanted water. Terrific!   My half a dozen oysters came and it was not only cleaned very well, but shucked smoothly. I couldn't do much better myself. The cocktail sauce on the other hand was sweet and not too sour, which was great because I usually hate cocktail sauce. Ended up drowning each oyster with it unnecessarily. These were good size oysters.  Next came the double sausage I ordered, and everything was perfect, it was tasty like a sausage should be. My only gripe is the ketchup, but being Canadian, I am used to a different kick of ketchup, and know that the US have a different supplier. The restaurant can't change that.   Best part was the bill. Wha? The bill? Yes, checking in for yelpers gets you 10% off and she gave me little to no trouble adding this discount. Go go yelpers! I'll probably drop by one more time before I leave back to Canada."}
{"text":"Happened to show up on a Wednesday \"college night,\" meaning $5 cover at 8pm. Bouncers at the door said there were drink specials and $1 off domestic drafts, so we agreed to pay. The place was empty and you could hear a pin drop until 10pm, when an awful DJ started rumbling the place. Turns out not all domestic drafts were $1 off -- only the shitty light beers. My beer can chicken was so dry that I could barely swallow it without choking. Steamed broccoli tasted like seafood, literally. And they forgot to add bacon to my friend's BLT."}
{"text":"What can I say that will begin to pay homage to the feelings I have in my heart for the bar that raised me from a novice drinker to the raging alcoholic I am today?  I love you Boardwalk Billy's, and I'm not ashamed to share my Top 7.5 reasons why:  1. If I've had a bad day, I can always count on killer drink specials to enchant my evening.   2. Crab Con Queso.  I'm salivating at the thought. 3. There's always an interesting mix of people gathered at the bar, mostly mouthy, but usually very friendly. 4. The atmospheric conditions are always favorable to me drinking A LOT of beer, especially on the patio.  5. I've hosted baby showers, going away parties, birthdays, etc. in the private room overlooking the lake. Beautiful setting. 6. Ian and Sasha, two of the best bartenders in the city. 7. If you're a single lady, you'll love the ratio. 7.5 Hello, Beautiful College Boys...."}
{"text":"Had dinner here our last night in North Carolina and really enjoyed it.  They have an amazing beer list, although I actually tried a hard orange soda!  Our service was good, maybe a little slow, but good.  The menu is a good size.  The husband got buffalo wings but the sauce was not hot so they brought him some hot sauce and after that he loved them.  I ordered a fish and chips platter and it was RIDICULOUSLY HUGE!!!  It was also YUMMY!  Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was upbeat.  I could see us going back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to the Boardwalk Billy's near UNCC a few times but this was our first time here.  It is an average place with average food, but our waitress was very nice.  We though this place would be packed for the AFC Wild Card game but it was pretty empty.  This location is also much smaller than the UNCC location.  There was nothing inherently wrong with the food except maybe the slaw having too much of a vinegar taste to it.  Fried shrimp, steampot, and fish tacos were all par.  They don't have too much craft beer on tap except for Fat Tire, but that's better than nothing.  We may go again if in the area, but also may not make a special trip to go."}
{"text":"Started with perfectly spiced bloody Mary's. Tried the fried pickles, which were nice and crispy, not soggy.  The three of us, combined,  had the BBQ pork sandwich, the smoked turkey BLT, and the Mahi Tacos.  All were very good. A nice selection of 4 different BBQ sauces graced the table.  Our server, Aeverie, was outstanding!  Engaging, funny, full of information about what to do in the area, and she made it a special time for us.  Kudos to you, Aeverie!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here with my team for lunch or with my kids when we have our night out. Good food, nice ambiance, helpful people."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo shrimp with Thai chili spice and it was a very generous portion and very tasty.  My friend had buffalo chicken fingers.  Open until 2 am on weekends! We sat on the patio.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This was one of the last places I went to on Saturday night. It was Avery up and live place! They had live music, and the two guys playing guitar were really good! They have multiple flat screen televisions so everyone could keep up with the NBA Playoffs and the MLB games as well.  The waitresses are really cool and took care of me and my homeboy very well. They had a wide variety of sandwiches in their late night menu; I got the cheeseburger and made mine a double with fries. Very basic. It was good, the party was cooked well done, the pickles, lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and they even put fried onion straws I their as well. It was very very good!  I would come here again for sure! It's a nice, fun and relaxing place for a group of people or even an individual to enjoy themselves! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, server was inattentive, food was marginal and a  bone or something (?) in my food.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with friends one day for lunch. I am a vegetarian while everyone else I was eating with ate meat.  There were no menu options other than sides or appetizers for vegetarian options so I got the mozzarella sticks. They were ok but nothing special or unique. I do believe they made their own marinara sauce which is a plus. They have a small local beer selection on draft as well.  All in all I wouldn't go here again. All of my meat eating friends seemed to enjoy it though. They have pretty standard food options, bar food for sure."}
{"text":"Cold beers, decent food and good music. This is probably the best spot in the Matthew's area for pounding beers and oysters."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Boardwalk Billy's. One of my favorite places to go whenever I am in Charlotte. The location is perfect - I usually like sitting by the windows so I can get a great view of the lake.   The service here is usually good, I've had a few instances where my waitress forgot about us. But it's alright because the food and atmosphere made it up for me.   Everything I've gotten here is good, my favorite dish is the coconut shrimp. It really is unbelievable. A definite must try. The salads are delicious, as well.  If you are in the area and want to try something new, come check them out. They're a great place to come with friends and enjoy a nice night out.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Never EVER again! The service was lousy and food wasn't all that great either...you have to be drunk to love this place. The drinks there wasn't even strong enough for me to even ACT like I enjoyed myself!!!"}
{"text":"If I based the review on the oysters, beer selection, and service I would be giving a 5. The oysters were great, somehow they were some of the best oysters I have had. However the ultimate steam pot was a little disapointing, small amount of crab legs and only a handfull of shrimp and mussels but a ton of potatoes. But it was only $16.99. I had 2 beers a dozen oysters and the steam pot for $41, not bad at all.  7/13/2010  Visited again today for a dozen oysters. Some how they were better than yesterday. Today they were huge and outstanding."}
{"text":"Update: The business responded and again attempted to discredit my accusations.  Either way you look at it, this location sucks.  I went to the other Boardwalk Billy's and enjoyed myself they were a lot nicer and their point of sale was able to accept my credit card payment unlike yours.  Also with regards to your comment about me being Elite that's so childish.. me being Elite has nothing to do with the way you treated me so nice attempt to sway the attention away from your blatant disrespect and highly egregious lack of customer service.  Job well done.  If you love being belittled and talked to like you are a child then this is the place for you!     Also just a heads up the most recent food inspection score I could see they were cited for personal cleanliness before.  The complete detail is available.  After already being seated for about 20 minutes and the other person in my party having a few beers, Aaron the server decided to come to my table to tell me that and I quote \"since we are getting busy and people are coming in, turn down your music or turn it off\"  All the while the music on the patio is blaring something talking about demons and I don't stand for that.  I asked for the manager and Aaron got an attitude and told me \"for what because I told you to turn the music off\" I said yes you are absolutely right.  Aaron came back outside and told me that the manager was busy and he'd be outside to speak with me in a little while.  I waited for over 15 minutes for the manager \"Dustin\" to come outside.  In the meantime I spoke with the only other customer outside on the patio with us, they said they had no issue with my music and couldn't even hear it.  Dustin then finally came outside.  He came outside seemingly cocky and said what can I do for you.  I explained the situation as described.  I also told him that the only person outside with us said they didn't have any issue with my music nor could they hear it.  I explained that the music playing from the restaurant was too loud and we didn't want to hear it since there was objective material not fit for the whole family playing.  Dustin told me that he wasn't changing or turning the music off or down and that this was private property and that's the music they play and if I had a problem I could leave.  At the time I had food from across the boardwalk because Boardwalk Billy's point of sale system was unable to read my payment method.  Since I couldn't order food from here I went there.  Dustin proceeded to tell me that since I wanted to complain that I needed to get rid of my food from the table that it was a healthcode violation, I told him that was fine since I was done anyway.  He stood there and asked me again to throw it away as if he was going to wait there the whole time until I performed the task for him as if I was his slave.  There were still paying customers in our party.  All the while no other customers were sitting outside on this patio.  As I finish this complaint submission we are the only customers sitting out here.  I'm appalled that you allow your employees and managers to act in such an unprofessional matter.  They literally told me that if I didn't like the way they ran their business to leave that it was private property.  I can promise you this, I will never set foot into a Boardwalk Billy's ever again and this experience is a shining star example of why I don't patronize this establishment.  Since you all want to talk about violations I'll also go ahead and file complaint with the Mecklenburg County Health Department and Code Enforcement because I watched some of your employees go and touch ready to eat food without properly washing and sanitizing their hands.  I'm not going to be disrespected and belittled in front of public so your managers can feel better about themselves.  I asked for Dustin's supervisor and he brought me out a comment card and told me to go on there to write a review.  I did not ask for a review/comment card.  He obviously did not want me to reach any higher than him since he thinks it's okay to treat customers in a disrespectful manner.  Since I was refused the proper contact information for upper management I decided to follow through with further action."}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughters 18th birthday here on Sunday and we had a wonderful time! Our waiter was very friendly and right on top of things even though it was just him and 18 of us and the food was excellent as well. Brooke the hostess was so sweet and courteous in making sure they would be able to serve such a large party...she went above a beyond, so glad to experience such good customer service...thank you!"}
{"text":"I love the water so for me, eating dinner here was awesome. Centered in the University area over the lake, it was nice. The view of the water, geese, ducks, and turtles made my meal enjoyable. I loved the fried pickles!!!!! Our first waitress was not too friendly but the visit ended on a high note with a new waitress. The food was great and so was the atmosphere. Prom season so there were young couples everywhere lol. Great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Great hamburger and great location!  Has a sports bar feel which I'm not crazy about, but food is good!"}
{"text":"Try the mashed potatoes & gravy! Sardis Rd is better than University && try their Fishbowls at your own risk! Not always stellar quality of food but I never say no when invited there for drinks! *lmao* Not sure how solid of a review this is but honesty is key!!"}
{"text":"Found on yelp and was not disappointed.  Some really great beers, and the food was phenomenal!  I had the Q Bar - 3 meats plus sides.  Everything was hot, the meats super moist and the sauces were really good as well!  Great value for super affordable cost"}
{"text":"Nice menu selection.  During this visit we enjoyed the crab con queso, fried green tomatoes, the flounder platter and sandwich and a chicken Caesar salad.  Varied draft list with quite a bit of local selections.  Paul, our waiter was attentive and courteous.  The location is nice especially since its near the University.  Like that it has outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Wow just wanted dinner, $10 cover for nothing going on, yea ok live music but it's a dude with a guitar.  Update so paying the cover was bs right, called our order in the fat, balled, tattoo bouncer said I must hold your drivers license while he are here."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad but it isn't fantastic.  It suffices for typical bar grub.  I do like that they have vegetarian options that are not on the menu for those that are non-meat eaters.  The other plus is the free, and plentiful peanuts.  Of course, as the night goes on, the floor is covered in shells.  I'm not a fan of the bar atmosphere here.  The music is hit or miss.  The DJ/Band sets up near the the back and has a makeshift (small) dance floor.  The music genre on the nights I've been there  is highly variable.  Cover bands, metal/rock to top 40.  The drinks are not very strong but on certain weekday they have some pretty unbeatable bottle/well specials.    The patio on good weather nights is also a definite plus.  Parking during the day is not a problem but on Friday/Saturday night the lot competes with the Wine Vault and Bad Dog.    Not a place I like to frequent, but I wouldn't be totally miserable if it became part of my unplanned night out."}
{"text":"My friend commented that she wasn't sure she wanted to pay a cover. Door guy over heard from 8 feet away and was so \"offended\" he wouldn't let us pay to get in. I know it sounds like there must be more to the story... But there isn't. It was baffling. So even though we took an uber just to go to this bar we couldn't get in. Stupid way to run a business."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when in town for work before I actually decided to move to Charlotte from Alabama.  I was sad to learn they got rid of their macaroni and cheese which was phenomenal.  But I still love the crab cakes, crab legs and bucket mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Always quick service. Great drink specials. Buffalo fingers are amazing with any sauce you choose! Not a fan of the sweet potato fries, but their fried green tomatoes and hush puppies are amazing! If you're looking for something very causal, upbeat, simple food.. This is the place."}
{"text":"Last night the smoked chicken wings were tough and chewy. That leaves me nothing to order other than beer and free peanuts. This place seem to attract a large number of NASCAR fans for some reason and they seemed to enjoy their food just fine"}
{"text":"Honestly, how can you come here and eat if you can't even get decent service??? Don't you want your customers to come back after a great experience? I'm so tired of going to places that gives such crappy service that even it affects the rest of your meal, which BTW the burger came out well done bc we weren't even sure if we could choose a temp since our server never asked. Train your servers to smile a little more and to be more attentive, that's all I ask."}
{"text":"To get the right feel for this place, think TGI Fridays meets your typical sports bar.    On a Tuesday afternoon this place was fairly crowded with the undergrad crowd from UNC.  There are plenty of big screen tvs showing sports which can be viewed from almost every seat in the place.  There is an outdoor section which overlooks the stream.  It seems nice but the geese might make it a little more trouble than it is worth.    The food is what you would expect from a sports bar.  The portions are huge.  Don't be afraid to select the half-orders, you will receive plenty of food.  The staff is very friendly in a Southern charm sort of way.    Be careful walking in because they serve peanuts in the shell in baskets to each table.  The custom is to chuck the peanut shells onto the floor while a staff member pushes a broom around the establishment.    Oh yeah, be warned this isn't California.  I looked at this rectangular object on the table and it actually took me a minute to mentally register that it was an ashtray.  People smoke still inside restaurants here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and location are great. The food and service, not so much. Had the fish tacos which were good but I've had much better. Others in our party thought the food was good but not great and some of us thought the food was not good at all. The service was very slow. At the end of our meal we all stood up and waited for our checks because we needed to go and it took forever to get them."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere. Family friendly. Amanda, my waitress was wondeful. Polite, knowledgeable, friendly. Had my youngest son, who has special needs with me and she acknowledged him and was so nice to him. She is the reason they got 3 stars and not 2. Now, let's talk food. Yeah...I had their burger with sweet potato fries and chicken strips. The strips were hot and they were good when dipped in the sauce. Outside of that, the food was non descript. Bland even. No taste, just texture. Would I go again? Uh, wouldn't make a point to go."}
{"text":"A great hangout, always a good selection of local beers and very attentive and friendly waitstaff. But as a special shoutout: the manager chatted with us briefly a few weeks ago when we were in for happy hour. That evening my husband left his prescription sunglasses at the table. 3-4 weeks later, I was in for happy hour again with some work colleagues, and the manager approached me saying \"weren't you in here a few weeks ago? I have something for you!\" and hands me my husband's glasses. What a memory! And what great customer service. That's the sort of experience that makes a good bar into a great local hangout :)"}
{"text":"Six of us ate lunch at BB's and it seemed like a fun place. Initially only four of us were there and we were waiting for the others to arrive. We sat at the bar to have a drink while waiting. The tattooed barmaid seemed a bit put off that she had to be working and felt as if she was doing us a favor by getting us drinks. Thank God it was only temporary to have to deal with her as the others in the group arrived not long afterwards. We were seated in the back overlooking the pond and were all surprised at how beautiful the view was. Our server was Alex and he could not been any more helpful or friendly while we were making our lunch choices. Everyone in our party enjoyed their lunch and Alex must have overheard us mention that one member in our party was celebrating a birthday that day as he brought out a cupcake with a bday candle in it. If and when we return to Charlotte, we would probably return for a meal   http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49022-d399087-r325593396-Boardwalk_Billy_s_Raw_Bar_Ribs-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html#"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday evening, for the first time. They were very busy. Told us the wait would be about 15 minutes. They ended up sitting us in 6 mins. Ed was our server. Had a flyer to receive free wings if we purchase a meal. So we had the BBQ mango wings. My meal was 4 bone ribs, corn on the cob, and steam broccoli. My wife had pulled pork. Wish they had a steak option. Nice experience. Would consider coming back, but when we usually come to the boardwalk and walk pass, they always seem so busy and crowded. But we we will keep it as an option."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night around 6pm and were seated right away bit definitely started to fill up though as the night progressed. We were seated on the patio which was great -- it was shaded and there are fans so we could enjoy the beautiful weather without sweating for the entire meal.   Our waitress was very attentive, checking in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. I ordered a tropical tangerine punch bucket which is a great size and comes in a cute Bacardi bucket. Although it was super tasty, I don't think there was that much alcohol in it. I'm not a complete lightweight, but for a drink that supposedly has six shots I would expect to somewhat feel the slightest bit tipsy. I didn't.   We started with the \"world famous\" crab con queso dip. I will start off my saying that I do not like seafood but enjoyed this dip. I might have eaten around most of the crab chunks though. But it was pretty tasty. My meal was mediocre. I had the mango BBQ chicken sandwich. I don't know if I would order the particular sandwich again but would gladly try other items on my menu. My boyfriend ordered the steam pot and he seemed pleased. It's no beachfront restaurant seafood but definitely filled that seafood void between trips to the beach.   Overall, loved the atmosphere of Boardwalk Billy's. We will definitely be back for drinks and appetizers with friends."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go. Waitstaff and bartenders are friendly and quick. The food is pretty damn good. It has a laid back atmosphere. Expect a wait time if you are going on fri or sat night (you think most people woukd realize this but....). I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Small bar with some big food. Lots of cold beer and very good service. It the kind of place where they know your name and what you like to drink. Food is fresh and there's a nice patio if you like to sit outside."}
{"text":"Best blue cheese dressing I have had in a long time.  Fish tacos wonderful and fresh.  Good beer selection including north Carolina beers."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance from my house so I go there often.  The bar staff is very nice and freindly.  they have good drink specials every night of the week and it is a good place to watch a game. The food is better than typical bar food and has a wide selection.  I like the cheese sticks and the Burgers."}
{"text":"Decent food cheap drinks and a great place to catch a sports game. The servers are friendly and this is located in a great spot with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night. There wasn't many people inside at all. Despite the place being empty, however, it still took a good 20-30 mins for someone to take our drink orders and bring them out.  I had the don Julio margarita which was surprisingly not bad.   This place is close to my house and the drinks aren't bad but the service is. Don't come here if you are in a hurry"}
{"text":"BF and I landed in Charlotte for business at 10pm on a Sunday and we were hungry once we checked into our hotel.  Room service was almost closed for the night so we went down to Boardwalk Billys since they were open til 2am.    They checked our ID at the door and gave us wristbands.  We figured this is a hot spot for the University students since UNCC is nearby.  But it was pretty dead on Sunday when we went.  Only the late night menu was available which included your typical bar food: wings, fries, nachos, and other munchies.   We went with wings, crab cakes, and fries since it was already getting late.  Really liked that they had a long list of sauces to pick from for the wings.  We tried the chipotle citrus, which was great with the chicken.   I'd definitely try to come back next time I'm in Charlotte to see this place crackin' and have a few drinks with dinner.  Also like that it's right on the man-made lake which provides a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Way better than expected! We got the Burgers fries and fingers. Priced at just $10, It was the perfect amount of food! Cooked nicely and served quickly. The atmosphere is laid back, lots of tv's to catch the game on. The hurricane punch bucket for $10 was a great deal as well because most of there drinks at $7."}
{"text":"What a great place in North Charlotte. Cool decor and a laid back atmosphere. Everyone working was friendly and helpful. I ordered shrimp and had them chilled. They were great. Everyone in my party enjoyed their entrees. The French Dip sandwich, coconut shrimp, salads, and burgers were all very tasty. We will go back here for sure."}
{"text":"Ahhh B-dubs you shall forever hold a spot in my heart!  Many, many a college Wednesday night spent at this place for 5$ pitchers followed by a cookout trip and the inevitable skipping of that 8am class.  Beautiful scenery, great patio, next to paddle boats, and food is pretty decent.  How can you not like a place where one of the menu options includes a giant burger, 6 wings, and a generous helping of fries!?!? And the loaded cheese fries are some of the best I have ever had for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to hang out here way back when we went to UNCC (about 1.2 million years ago if you ask my kids). We didn't go for the food then & after our dining experience last night I assume most of their customers feel the same way. The bar scene is lively & they have great drink specials. However, we actually went to eat dinner last night with our kids. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The food was lackluster. My pulled chicken sandwich had 2 bones in it. The fries were greasy & didn't seem very fresh. The kids macaroni was so dry it looked and tasted like it had been sitting under the heat for hours. If we go back here it will be to sit at the bar for drinks."}
{"text":"The food and service go hand n' hand here and both at just mediocre. I ordered a turkey burger and it was really bland and dry. I tried my friends fish sandwich and it too was just ok. Sorry to say I spent my money on this at least my server was nice."}
{"text":"Cody Wade is an awesome waiter. He made our dinner so enjoyable and he really knew his stuff. Great food and service. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have been here Atleast 3 times and staff is always nice.  Of course some servers are better at their jobs than others, but that's anywhere. As long as I get served in a reasonable time, I'm content. My gripe is that sometimes they give peanuts as an appetizer and sometimes they don't. I want my damn peanuts ALL the time :-(  The food is nothing spectacular, but it's good for a casual meal. I have never dined in the indoor area. The deck patio over the pond is too awesome to to be cooped up indoors! They also have a front patio area for a view of the Boardwalk traffic.  Dogs can also dine with their owners on the front patio.  There is nothing bad I can really say about Boardwalk Billy's. It has become one of my favorite spots in the area. The atmosphere is casual and welcoming. It is definitely a great summertime spot."}
{"text":"A University City staple, Boardwalk Billy's is worth visiting at least once. I suppose I've been going since 2006 when I started going to college nights. I'm not sure if they still do college night, but it's still a good place to visit if you're in the North Charlotte area. The restaurant is located in a  boardwalk area, by the water and other restaurants, so there's always a group, especially on Friday nights. They have a long beer list, large bar area, large patio and ample indoor seating. Great place to watch a game ( large TVs everywhere). My favorite dish here is the Fried Flounder Platter, its seasoned and fried just right."}
{"text":"Dinner at Boardwalk Billy's was a great experience.  I ordered the Q Combo which included ribs and sausage.  The sides that came with the dinner were good, but I have had better.  The meat however was excellent in quality and flavor.  The service was excellent also.  Would definitely return when back in town."}
{"text":"I still love this restaurant. Was a little disappointed in the wait staff today. My server acted like he hates his job. Said the bare minimum to me. I wasn't even done ordering before he took my menu and started walking away. Basically finished my order while looking at his back. Pretty sure he wanted to get back to standing around and watching the World Cup instead of working. It just rubbed me the wrong way. The food was still delicious. I went with my regular, chicken finger plate with the chicken fingers tossed in franks red hot and added cheese to the fries.  Been ordering it for years and it never disappoints. Food was delicious and came out piping hot. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years.  I LOVED the cheap beer they had in college.  It's changed a lot over the years.  They have great lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11-2.  I always get the 6 chicken fingers and fries basket with the fingers tossed in franks red hot.  The fingers are lightly breaded and delicious.  They also have seafood steam pots that are amazing and large enough to share.  They did a complete remodel of the interior and it looks great and is always clean.  Sometimes the service can be quite slow for lunch.  I would understand if they were busy but on this particular visit they weren't busy at all.  Overall I've always had great service when one come here so that's why I gave it four stars.  They now have a wide selection of craft beers if that's your thing. I'm not sure what the night scene is like there anymore.  I would imagine it's full of college kids because of the college campus near by."}
{"text":"Boardwalk Billy's isn't bad for what it is, and it's a decent little bar that's not too far from my house. It's nice and big on the inside as well, which makes it easy to accommodate a large group.  The foods are nice and fried and greasy, kind of standard bar fare with an emphasis on seafood. The crowd tends to be a little older most nights, which helps keep it a little more subdued. It's kind of like a college bar for the 25+ crowd. It's a good alternative to a lot of the other chains in the Sardis area, and there are always good specials, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Convenient location next to the Hilton hotel. Kinda surprised they charge a cover on Thursday nights. I ordered the smoke Jamaican jerk wings, they were so-so at best. Bartenders were nice and helpful with suggestions. Good drink specials."}
{"text":"The Cesar Chicken wrap and sweet potato fries were Delicious!!! I enjoyed sitting out back on the balcony on such a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I favorite spot. Somewhere we go just to go chill and relax. I only had one thing and that's the wings and French fries with a Blue Moon. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 2.5/5 Pretty loud. We had a three-person party and at some points, it was difficult to concentrate on the conversation. At the same time, we understood: it's a bar.   Taste: 3/5: The hushpuppies were pretty good, the crab cakes were decent, but they were expensive and the quantity was very limited. The fried flounder sandwich didn't have a lot of flavor.   Food Presentation: 4/5: The peanuts are a nice touch. Flounder sandwich is served in a basket, open-faced, and delicious-looking. The butter is served in a separate container which makes moving things around effortless!   Service: 3.5/5 Nothing special, but no complaints.   Cleanliness: 4/5: Generally pretty clean, our server wiped off our table with a spray because one in our party was allergic to peanuts (which they have on the table for you to eat while you wait for your food)."}
{"text":"I am not impressed. In short it's a great big beer bar. Wings weren't great. Menu & bar were sticky. Service was slow."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Wings are great, as are the burgers. Service is usually very good, even when busy.  They have a decent number of TVs for sports viewing, and this can be a pretty loud joint during football season or other major events. They also have a nice outdoor deck area on the 'water' (of the man-made pond), which is perfect for spring/fall...not so much in the summer unless you love the heat!"}
{"text":"Glad this wasn't my first time here or I wouldn't come back. The waiter had a serious attitude. Out of the three parts of my order, only one of them was delivered correctly. And when I pointed it out to our server, he argued with me and said it was right!... and made me feel like he was blaming ME for my order being wrong. Very uncomfortable. He reluctantly asked me if I wanted the correct wings... of course! It's what I ordered!! On top of that he was difficult to flag down. The tude was definitely unnecessary.  I've been let down the past 2 visits to this place. The service has gone downhill, and I've noticed there have been considerably fewer patrons there. They've also changed some of their menu without actually reflecting it on the menu. For example--they got rid of the awesome shoestring fries. Sad day!  Sorry Boardwalk, I've got to downgrade you to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Loved it! There were three of us and everyone loved the fresh fish and seafood.   The view and location can't be beat and our server was awesome.  Additionally, I appreciated their draft beer selection. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good oysters and the crab queso is very good. Bartenders seem pissed off at the world. Will find somewhere else while here on business once a month. Everything was clean and it's a great location. Other than service i would give it an A.  Hopefully they get some service that likes their job."}
{"text":"Place was good! We enjoyed the music and the food! It took a little long  to get our good, but they were pretty busy! Live band was great! I would come back!"}
{"text":"I had the skinny margarita and it was good, much better than that awful sweet and sour mix restaurants love to ruin a drink with.  For dinner I had the low country boil and it was good, not the best I've had but certainly not the worst.  Ben the server was great"}
{"text":"The official name of this place is Boardwalk Billy's Raw Bar and Ribs. That is extremely misleading for a BBQ fanatic like me. The ribs were right off the shelf at the local Costco. No smoke flavor. Tough. Very little meat. If the word ribs is in your name, please don't sell me Costco ribs. The brisket was also not good. Extremely fatty, under-cooked, and again, no smoke flavor. I suppose I should have expected this given the bar-like atmosphere, but c'mon. The word RIBS is in your name!"}
{"text":"Been really disappointed the last few times I've been here. The last time I went, a friend and I went for lunch on a Saturday.  The place was dead and we chose to sit on the patio.  When we asked our server what the drink specials were, she said she didn't know and would go check.  She came back and told us Yuengling was on special and there was some sort of frozen drink on special.  I was interested in the frozen drink and asked more about it. She again had to go inside to ask what the frozen drink was.  When I ordered it, she told me that it was $5 (when I got my receipt, it was $6.50, which I let slip because I was ready to go). We finally ordered, and although I made some adjustments to my order, it was nothing complicated (I'm a server myself).  She had a lot of trouble understanding what I was asking for and was clearly hungover. Our food was less than memorable and we had to wait for more time than necessary for our check. I may give the food another try, but I'd definitely request a different server."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get at this spot.... pretty good fried seafood and sandwiches but it is by far the best place in Charlotte to get green fried tomatoes....they never disappointment me when I'm having a craving....if you never tried them and your in Charlotte, you have to order them from Boardwalk Billy's"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my sister's place so both of the past 2 times I've visited we've stopped in.  Apparently it's a great local spot!    Lunch there in the spring was good.  I had a fish sandwich and we enjoyed sitting outside near the boardwalk.  What a nice feature!  Good service, good food, and good times.  Someone else tried the fried pickles and someone else enjoyed the fries.    Last weekend my sister, Mom, and some friends stopped by for late night drinks and snacks.  Great drink specials!  I enjoyed $6 Grey Goose and Cran drinks and the others enjoyed a few beer specials.  Mom ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and subbed steamed veggies for fries.  Not bad for 10pm!  I ordered 6 steamed oysters.  $7.99 was definitely steep for me in terms of pricing, but I really wanted them and thankfully they didn't disappoint!  Others ordered sandwiches with fries and all said the fries were terrible -- my sister's were barely cooked....so no-go on those.  Sad.  Service was good though.  We never felt \"abandoned\" as you do in some bars, but were taken care of very well.  Open mic night was also going on which we enjoyed.  We'll probably hit it up again next time we're in town since my sis and her friends enjoy it so much."}
{"text":"Met my husband here and 3 years later we had our wedding reception here! Great food (got a lot of compliments from our guests) and very accommodating to our 100 guest party!  Thanks so much for helping make our special day even better!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!! GREAT SERVICES!! I loved the oysters nice and fresh. Its a great place with great view of the boardwalk. They have outside tables."}
{"text":"Our family was out shopping in Charlotte.  The usual afternoon hunger striked and we opened up our go to app, yelp.  Once again, a hit.  The food was great and they treated the kids like kings. The staff was friendly and the portions were great.  They have variety in their menu and fantastic flavor in their barbecue dishes and fish.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant in the University Area. Great environment for college kids and other sports fans. Good for lunch with the family aswell. It's a tradition that my friends and I go whenever they're in town.   Try the Philly Cheese!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Boardwalk Billy's to start out the night.  I don't feel like it's a very good all night place but they do have a cheap special if you want to stay in the area.  Awesome wings, fantastic crap queso dip.  They also have some good pasta dishes or a regular burger.  Lunch special always 6 bucks which is a great deal!  They also just started serving Landshark which was fabulous so get a Landshark, some wings, sit outside and enjoy the breeze."}
{"text":"It's not my favorite place to eat however the food is not bad I'm not crazy about the wings but the burgers are good this place gets very busy so I've only dined in once"}
{"text":"I am not in this town often but this place is a WIN-WIN! Great service, good food @ excellent prices! Very glad I went inside and left completely satisfied! Need a Boardwalk Billy's in New Jersey!!!"}
{"text":"Billy's ultimate steam pot and oysters are great. It sits right by the water too."}
{"text":"Recently visited and received terrible from both wait staff and manger. The food was dissatisfactory and poorly put together. Extremely confrontational bar staff will not not be going back."}
{"text":"To be fair, I arrived at about 9pm for food so I I totally get that the kitchen has slowed down... BUT!!! Don't serve me food that's been sitting in a pot ALL DAY!!!   1. My chicken wings looked like skeletons with a tough skin wrap... dry and tasteless.  2. The meat plate had a blop of BBQ that pooled grease at the bottom... yuck!  The beers were good and cold but that's what saved this place from being a One Star-rated joint...  The service was OK if not a little too perky... sometimes I need to be left alone and not asked all the time if everything is alright. Well, I might have been tired and grumpy but it was still a tad too \"in your face\"...  ... still bothered by the terrible food..."}
{"text":"Came here on an early Friday evening and liked the vibe of the place.  Very casual bar-like place with an open atmosphere that pours out onto the man-made pond.  Bartender was casual and friendly, and best of all, made some strong drinks.  Always a plus.  Food was really sub-par.  Raw oysters had zero flavor in them.  You'd want a taste of the ocean in the oysters, but none was to be had.  Very bland and disappointing.  A steamer platter of oysters, mussels, shrimp, crab, and corn and potatoes was also very bland; and over-cooked.    I'd come back for the drinks, but not the food.  Nice atmosphere though, for a Friday after work chill."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.  Good bar food and nice drink specials.  The last time I was there will be my last.  The bartender (forgot her name) was awesome, but she was getting off, so I settled my bill with her.  I decided to get another beer from the new bartender, Travis.  He puts my beer down and says \"name!\".  I tell him I'm just going to settle and try to hand him my credit card and he says \"I don't give a f*** if you don't want to open a tab!\"  Just moved around the corner from this place and thought I found a cool spot.  Travis ruined that."}
{"text":"They serve peanuts and have everyone throw the shells on the floor - that says it all about this place. The dirty floor bothered me but I guess that's part of the \"charm\" (i.e. college kids can screw this place up and no one cares because it's crappy anyway!). I had a carribean jerk chicken sandwich and it was good - there was no spice to it, but it was more flavor that I was expecting! My mom got the pimento cheese burger with fried green tomatoes on the side and it was OK (\"but it's no Pinky's pimento!\" - Mom), too.   There are a good amount of TV's here and a view of the pond, so that's a plus to the locale, but the parking lot was packed at 2pm on a Friday, so parking at night or the weekends might not be a boardwalk in the park (har har har).  The food is OK, the service is OK, the location is OK. So the theme of Boardwalk Billys? OK, ok ok ok ok OKKKKKK, Oh-kay!"}
{"text":"I love eating here as it's casual and pretty cheap but still has a great view and good food. Our favorites are the coconut shrimp and mahi tacos. Beware that it is more like a sports bar so it can get pretty loud when there's a game on."}
{"text":"Food, cold. Drinks watered down. Service, non existent. Down the street from the University, I guess this is reminiscent of a college bar... Not for grown folks!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. Service at the bar was so quick, I wasn't ready to eat when food arrived. Bartenders: Clint, Stinky, Sam and Lyndsey are the best! The level of service they give can only be matched by the best places I've been in NY and DC. Their management better take care of them! Love this place."}
{"text":"I really liked this place . I just went there for the first time last weekend and it was delicious . It was a bit busy because it was Saturday night but we only waiting for about 15 mins. I got the Jamaican chicken and it was super good with mash potatoes! It's definitely a good date night spot !"}
{"text":"This is a great local bar with a cool atmosphere along the boardwalk and the pond. Our server was excellent, very friendly and attentive. I had the fish tacos. They were awesome! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OK wings. Great selections in hot sauces. Good cold beer. Great place to watch sports. They need new TVs."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant and the surrounding area. Paddle boat on the lake, boardwalk, surrounded by multiple restaurants and stores.."}
{"text":"While sitting here trying to watch the SC and UNC game, my waiter approaches me and asked me where the rest of my party was...of course women are late somerimes...lol but in actuality i checked in and waited for the seat im currently in...so regardless of the eta of my guess im still a paying customer. So for my waiter to say i couldve turned another 2 tables while i sat at the bar was a serious problem with me. My drink order was placed so now my time is your time so treat me accordingly. Beyound pissed with the comment."}
{"text":"This places kind of hold a special spot for my husband and i as it is where we signed the papers to submit our first home bid.  If you are looking for a casual place to sit and drink with friends or family this is a great spot.  They have a good beer selection and a pretty basic menu.  I don't recommend the crab cakes, as the ones I had were burned and tasted like I was eating crab flavored bread.  But their salads are great and the oysters are pretty solid according to my husband.  The staff is a little slack, when we were there there was a waitress (not serving us thankfully) that was sitting with some customers and smoking with them, which I find to be disgusting and incredible unprofessional.  Not sure where the manager was to manage that.  But it is a lively casual place and a good spot overall for just that, casual dining."}
{"text":"We are visiting family here in Matthews and we were told that Boardwalk was a great place for burgers. It wasn't bad, it was \"meh\"-- we we're very hungry from our flight so they had a chance at vulnerable people who would like anything, unfortunately the burgers were very dry and over cooked, the fries were probably the best thing on the plate. I should have ordered the wings in hindsight. The service was good, on point and attentive, that was the strong suit--the burgers seemed like they were sitting under heat lamps for a long time. If you need to catch a game, drink some beers and get some wings--this is your spot. However, if you're in search for a tasty burger, look somewhere else."}
{"text":"My son and I were in Charlotte for the Nascar race and stayed at the Hilton nearby. Of course the south is known for great BBQ and this place was close and had good reviews so I was anxious to have some great food. We are from Portland Oregon, a foodie \"mecca\" these days and it seems our food rating scale is a lot different than here as this food was not very good. It was just okay at best. If this is what you are used to, that's fine but all the food we had in Charlotte was bland and uninspired. In Portland we have better BBQ."}
{"text":"I went here on a date with my boyfriend, cute location and good service. However, we both got the BFW (Burger Fries & Wings) and the wings tasted like fish/ seafood! Neither of us finished them, we even tried more than one to see if it might have just been one wing but it wasn't the case! They had a terrible after taste! Thankfully I ate them after the burger (which was great by the way), if not the wings would have ruined the whole meal. They really should have their food separate at all times!"}
{"text":"I love the food! And my waitress Cali could not of been better! She always checked in and brought everything out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Drinks = OK Food = Didn't try Atmosphere = Crap. Music trivia on Tuesday is so bad that I wouldn't send my enemas here (yes I meant enemas not enemies)"}
{"text":"Just to preface this, I gave it a 3 because in some aspects it's a 2 and other it's a 4.  This place has great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly!  Every time I have been here the service is nothing short of exceptional.  They have a pretty decent beer selection and good drink deals.  Their menu has a bit of everything from wings, burgers, sandwiches, seafood and barbecue. The table peanuts are a nice touch as well.  Now for the not so good and hopefully these have only happened to my wife and I. Of the last two visits my wife was served a raw burger once and today she was served a burger with a hair in the frys.  I would go here again, but might start to rethink it if we have a couple more unfortunate situations. My wife and I go here a few times a month."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Our waitress Amber V was awesome. Her food recommendations were great being that we were from Hawaii and didn't know what to order. Smoked turkey was delicious. Susie Q was amazed by their delicious roasted peanuts."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night so they were pretty busy, but the service was good and the food was even better! I ordered crab cakes and they were as good as you can expect when you're not in Maryland. (Where I'm from) My wife ordered basic chicken tenders and they were amazing. It was nice to walk around outside by the pond and feed the ducks afterwards."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst place in town.   Let me start by saying the server a struggling college student was great and this is not a reflection of her. Shanay was great. She was pleasant and accommodating. The rest of the staff struggles at life. I suspect they expect everything for free and don't put any effort into their job what so ever.  The place was trashed like it was never cleaned from the night before. The food was so so.  Skip it!"}
{"text":"This is literally your typical college bar, with a beach twist to it. They have good wings, burgers, and fries but everything is only okay. I always get their burger, fries and wings trio and that's enough food to hold me over for a while. Their nachos I will say are the best I have ever had! My boyfriend and I love getting them and splitting them, they're so good. I will say do not get their coconut shrimp. Soggy, and squishy, not very crisp and juicy like I was hoping for.  However if you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner this is the place you're looking for. The waitstaff is also pretty nice too."}
{"text":"I went there the other day and the bummer was they charged me a cover charge to walk in Michael Caine is this exclusive nightclub bouncer laughed at me and he just said you're welcome so I sit down at the bar and I noticed this the whole bunch of young college kids and older black guys just hanging around high-fiving everybody and very rowdy and a lot of suspicious activity so I drunk a couple of beers and ordered two chicken wings there are good to be beer is cold the Buffalo shrimp is very good the service was decent I will I go back again probably not due to the sea like is lot of suspicious activity going on there with older black guys and the younger teenage college kids"}
{"text":"Ha! I went on my first date with my bf around the Boardwalk so on his bday I brought him back to the boardwalk 4 lunch. Cute right? **smitten**_  He ordered the seafood boil ~ the sweetest corn ever. I ordered the Brisket & OMG it was so tender. This place gets 5 stars because when I asked for a pitcher of water that's what I got!!!! The waitress was very attentive. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once after work one night, and the experience wasn't too good.  I remember ordering some kind of burger with a side salad. The salad was very delicious, the best part of the whole meal. I don't remember much about the burger. That kinda says this place is forgetful.  I also believe that the pricing here is pretty ridiculous. That's the main reason why we haven't gone back for such a long time. Maybe we will in the future.  The customer service also sucked the last time we were there. The lady that helped us was rude, and the decor is not too flattering either. It needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Good buger and the fried pickles were good too. I catch the game there during football season."}
{"text":"This is a good option if you are in the Matthews area and are looking for some good eats and cold drinks. The beer and cocktails are a flowing all day long. After inhaling a pack of cigarettes as you enter the front door... You are seated by a hostess then greeted by a free pail of peanuts. A little something for you to chew on as you browse the large menu.  I don't think I have had anything bad on the menu at all! Anything with jerk chicken is tasty as well as their house made Reuben! Don't forget to ask for your fries to be done extra crispy with sriracha powder.. You can thank me later. I've been lucky enough to learn about a secret menu item - pork rinds! Ask for them to be done in the sriracha powder also... Woo!  It's a good place to watch a sporting event, there are several boob tubes placed all around the restaurant. They also offer live music on Sundays which is fun and team trivia on Thursday. A calendar of daily specials will keep you coming back...  I've never seen Billy. Or a boardwalk."}
{"text":"The best thing on this menu is the hot peel and eat shrimp. The service here is horrendous! It seems that the wait staff receives no training. I've been here a few times and it's always the same. The staff runs around like a chicken with their heads cut off. The food is standard bbq fare and that about it. Expect to wait a while before you get your drinks and food."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for the little lake in University Place.  It almost always ends up being cold - or at least breezy - when I'm there, but it's just a nice feature.  And looking out of the windows at Billy's to see the lake is just cool.  It will never be Boardwalk at the Beach or anything, but it's just nice, and that gives them a leg up.  When I sat down and looked over the menu, I had a heck of a time figuring out what I wanted to eat.  That's a bad sign, because I love to eat.  I can almost always find something that I want, so when nothing appeals to me, it means that I'm not in the mood to eat.  I ended up ordering some kind of burger and I ate it.  It left absolutely no impression on me.  That's almost worse than leaving a bad impression.  The staff was equally bad - or at least as uncaring.  It was just a so-so meal.  I really have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Get the chicken fingers tossed in JBO and you can't go wrong. Drink specials are always on point!!! Specials during the week include $3 craft beers and $2 domestics just depending on the day."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar. The food and service were really good. The bottom line was that me and my wife had a good time. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Because of its location (the University area boardwalk, across highway 29 from UNCC) and its menu (some of the best sandwiches and wraps anywhere), this is a great place to meet, greet and eat, especially in the Spring and Summer months.  I try to get here for lunch at least once per week."}
{"text":"Ate here twice, due to its proxinity to the Hilton University.  Its location, location, location.  I think they can do a much better job with both food and service. This place has so much potential. If they would only make the effort, I would come back time and time.  However, as it stands now, the BBQ is dry.  The burger is ...well..like any burger..  Come on Billy.... make better food.. make fresh food..make something unique.."}
{"text":"Great service from the bar even though they were crazy busy. Food was very good and the beer selection was impressive, several local beers along with many other great options. The music is perfect for the vibe here and it's a nice little getaway from the norm."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and sat at the bar with my boyfriend. The girl bartender who's pregnant kept giving me and my boyfriend dirty looks all night, we had a total of 5 drinks (me) and 6 drinks (my bf). We were there since 10pm so we had a drink per hour until about 12am when we had two drinks. We also had one shot each and bought some for the band that was playing (amazing group!!!). The pregnant bartender then decided to grab all the other girls that were bar tending and started talking about me and my boyfriend in front of us. I guess she \"thought\" we had too much to drink since I was laughing with my boyfriend. There were other much drunker people around. My advice is if you go there and she's bar tending just sit somewhere else, she gives horrible service and I will not be coming back after that."}
{"text":"this place gets packed at night on any day. they actually charge you to get in. lol. didn't try any food just got some drinks. their drink specials are pretty good."}
{"text":"Called in to order something to go. The lady kept on yelling at me because apparently she couldn't hear me. So I spoke up and told her what I wanted, which was the crab cake basket. I said \"I seen online that you had a crab cake platter or something\" she said \"no, it's a crab cake BASKET, not a platter\" I said ok, that's what I want. She said, was what 2 sides, I said what do u have, and her response was \"u didn't see them online\".....  I hung up. Her unprofessionalism and attitude just lost them a customer.   And the manager Dustin isn't any better, he stood up for her."}
{"text":"Normally love the food here but tonight they're served me undercooked pink bloody chicken"}
{"text":"I love raw oysters and was excited to get some good ones at a \"raw bar\"...nope! They were tiny (smaller than a quarter), warm, and didn't taste good at all. I had to send them back. My fiancé got the peel and eat steamed shrimp and they were completely overdone and rubbery."}
{"text":"Visited BWB on 5/10/16 with my bf..sat out on the patio by the lake and it was very relaxing. I had the fried flounder and shrimp dinner and it was delicious both were hot and crispy fried golden brown the corn on the cob was well seasoned and hot. My bf had the Q combo with ribs, chicken and pulled pork the ribs and chicken were smoked to perfection and the pork was very tender. I checked in with my yelp app and received 10% off our total. We will be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"If you need a seafood fix then you need to check out Boardwalk Billy's. My favorite menu item is the steampot; the broth is delicious and I get extra shrimp instead of oysters. The meal is HUGE and comes with potatoes and corn. I also tried the clam chowder and it is wonderful! We go on Thursday nights when there is trivia and 2 dollar drinks. Even the best, local drafts are only 2 bucks! We frequent the Galleria location and the service is prompt and friendly. I knocked off 1 star because their burgers are AWFUL. Stick with the seafood and wings and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There isn't to appeal to me in this place.  It's obviously a college kid hangout bar: it's super-loud, dirty, disorganized, slow on the service, and yet not cheap.  The food, I'll say, is surprisingly good...especially if you're comparing it to other bar food.  The fries and BBQ sauce are especially good, but each of the times I've come here I couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting next to me because the music has been to loud and the crowd trying to rise above an already deafening noise level.  Probably good for people who like to silently stare at each other and get drunk, and good for a bite to eat if you can sit outside, but otherwise the food doesn't compensate for the bad environment...at least for me."}
{"text":"Awesome spot.  The wife had chicken tacos and I had the shrimp tacos.  Both were exceptional.  Service was great, atmosphere was calm (I'd expect nothing less at 1:30pm on a Saturday).  I bet this place gets better at night."}
{"text":"Smoke house wings are delicious.  Has a wide selection of beers and t.vs for every game.  Great place to grab a beer and wings."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this establishment with my Husband. Overall we enjoyed our meals. My husband ordered the BFF (Burger Fingers and Fries), this was our first time ordering this item and figured as the name suggests we would get those three items. When we placed the order online, we selected coleslaw as a side believing that it was in addition to the fries. However, when my Husband called to inquire about not receiving fries, Mary was quite rude. Instead of using this opportunity to explain the menu, she decided to scold/blame my Husband for selecting coleslaw. Maybe BFS (burger, fingers, and side) would be a better suited name to limit confusion. Keeping your tone of voice professional would have made all of the difference.We love to support local businesses, so we'll give this place another shot. Hopefully Mary was just having an off moment and isn't normally so snappy with customers."}
{"text":"This place is located near the University area of Charlotte. It's kind of off the beaten path, but I think that's a good thing. We went to another restaurant in the area, but they were only serving a lunch buffet. We say the other spot, which was located by a man-made pond/lake? It had paddle boats and more. The restaurant was large with plenty of seating. We elected to sit outdoors. The seating was great and plenty of shade.   The menu was vast. I had shrimp tacos, corn on the cob and mac &cheese. I liked the corn on the cob best. The mac & cheese was just ok. I also enjoyed the tacos. Everyone seemed to like their choices. The parking options were good. You have a short walk over to the restaurant and you can take a walk around the boardwalk after to burn a few calories. The bathrooms were clean, the restaurant was spacious. Our waitress was nice, she was very helpful with menu choices. I'd visit again."}
{"text":"The only good thing about eating here would be the view from the patio. I've eaten here a few times since I lived nearby. The service has never been spectacular and the food has never been above mediocre."}
{"text":"I tried to come here the night of my 21st birthday and was denied by some rude power tripping bouncer who said they couldn't accept my temporary drivers license that was issued to me by the DMV."}
{"text":"Took forever to get someone to come to our table -kinda dirty and sticky. Came here years ago when smoking was allowed and we walked out then. Thought Id give it another chance, however not much has changed except the smoke.   Parking lot, casual dress, never used the restroom."}
{"text":"During my UNCC days Boardwalks was definitely the local watering hole.  I have recently revisited this past Sunday.  Staff is still friendly, food is good.  I was pleased to see they added fried pickles, which I did not remember from before.  Beer was cold and has a good atmosphere being right by the water.  This place is great, I would not go there at night with the college crowd."}
{"text":"Hello friends,   This is a go to spot for the locals. Great divey feel. College kids. Hipsters & Dippers. They always run some sort of specials.   Today I shared oysters (yeah, I know) and a Bowl (nope not THAT TYPE of bowl) I believe it was called the Wild Berry Punch Bowl. ($22.00). Man it was good. It really did the trick.   I don't live in this side of town but wanted to come here on a nice Sunday afternoon and have some food/drinks while people watching on the patio.  They give you peanuts for the wait.  Go enjoy, have fun TTFN"}
{"text":"Really wish I could give this place more stars but the service staff is so hit and miss, the (male) bartenders are somewhat smart asses a lot of the time, over serving is a problem, the food always seems to pretty tasty, smoked wings can be dry sometimes, fries are always inconsistent hot/cold, portion and prices are in line, management maybe not always focused as the should be, I'll keep trying the place ???"}
{"text":"We live close so we eat at Billy's a lot but never have been disappointed. It was the first time trying the Southern pulled pork BBQ instead of the usual suspects. It was good. And they sell Mecktoberfest. All in all, still good."}
{"text":"Ah, Boardwalk...how you've changed. Used to go here all the time. Then, they moved from the little hole-in-the-wall storefront to the big, impressive one diagonally across the walk. And they suffered. Had friends down from NY who *always* went there during race week, and they will never go back. Gave it some time, went for lunch during school, and liked it once again. Went Monday night after my 2nd shift, and it was AWFUL. You know it's been a bad experience when the best part was the bouncer checking your ID. The Hostess wasn't at the door and we waited....and waited....and waited. The server on the floor was too absorbed in breathing to acknowledge our presense, even when addressed. In 4 words, she blew us off. Soooo... off we went to the bar. The bartenders were very nice; the bar was very dirty where we sat. For a place with less than 12 patrons, it was ridiculously loud. But... no hostess meant we sat at the bar. Did I mention the server that blew us off? She had tables come in AFTER we sat at the bar, so, no, she wasn't closing the dining room or going off duty, both of which we considered. Food was OK, not in the rave category. He had a blackened chicken pita, and I had the coconut shrimp. I think mine was better than his, but... His came with regular fries, and I asked for sweet potato fries- both were cooked correctly, but ruined by way too much salt. Way.Too.Much. Orange sauce was thin, but tasty.  My disappointment stems from the buildup I gave my guy on the way to the restaurant. He'd have been happy with The Wine Vault, but I insisted that he'd like the food and atmosphere at the Boardwalk better. My mistake."}
{"text":"Working on the University area this is a staple. I love the low key atmosphere and yummy food. My go too is the classic chicken finger plate. I love the borage of sauces that im able to use to grasph my appetite and attitude for the day. Did I mention that there was an awesome patio over looking a water feature..."}
{"text":"Wow it was great! The food was excellent I had the seafood steamed in the pot as shown on here it was great crab legs and corn potatoes clams and a lot of shrimp my date had Buffalo chicken and salad we are taking some home they give you so much the boardwalk was great live music wow it was a magical nite we had a great time"}
{"text":"We had a really good time the last time we were here. Use the \"NoWait\" app to see how long it'll be and you can check yourself in before you get there.   The waitress was tentative and my food was perfect (I got the nachos with chicken).   My boyfriend liked his wings."}
{"text":"Average chain-ish restaurant if you like that sort of thing.  There is really nothing that stands out, or that is special about this place or the atmosphere.  That being said, it is not bad, just nothing spectacular.    The service is hit or miss.  Sometimes it can be decent.  There is never a wait to be seated, which is always a plus, anywhere you go!  The atmosphere is open and friendly.    I have only eaten the oysters and they are good!  Never had any complaints about them.  They have oysters available all year round, so if you're craving them, it's nice to know you have a spot to come.  It is very casual environment."}
{"text":"Review update: ok I did decide to come back...never say never.  I stopped in on a weeknight, I think they were having trivia, so it got kind of loud.  I was seated really quickly, which was nice.   The waiter was ok, I think he was a little overwhelmed.  I got the mojito (coconut) and coconut shrimp appetizer.  They were both surprisingly good.  I would definitely get the shrimp again!! Great flavor.   So now I may come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The ribs are pretty good. My coworkers and I go from time to time. The drinks leave something to be desired I must say. I've tried to find one that I like, but so far I haven't. I still recommend this place because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday experience. As a first timer, I was very impressed with the staff and service! Ordered queso, side salad and coconut shrimp, and it was all delicious. Big portions with plenty left over. Sweet tea was on point. Beautiful view over the water. Chris was a great server with a love for his job, and a positive attitude to top it off. Great experience, and I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I'd like to really give it 2 and a half stars, but alas! yelp likes whole stars.   Honestly, if you don't live in the area, I don't know if it's worth the hike up 85 (I'm in uptown). The best thing this place has going is its location. There's a beautiful corner overlooking the water and plenty of outdoor seating. However, if you sit out front, you constantly get the whiff of smoke from the smoking area being right next to the tables.   As for the food, well, I could have done just as well pulling the same items from the freezer. I had the coconut shrimp, and there were only maybe ten-twenty coconut flakes for all ten shrimp. There were other menu items that sounded good, but nothing looked over the top amazing as it came out.   Drink specials, they've got those, but after that and their location, they really dropped the ball on food. If only they kicked it up, just a smidge, I feel like there's great potential."}
{"text":"Great Food and Drinks!!  Had their steamed shrimp and it was Sooooo GOOD!  The seasonal Pumpkin Ale in October was awesome.  My fiancé had fried flounder and shrimp, and their 2.50 Yuengling beer all day every day is a deal.  My favorite part is the complimentary peanuts in a shell! :)  Definitely a great spot to watch the game."}
{"text":"After graduating from uncc I barely make it here very often but I can say without a doubt they have the best wings in Charlotte. GET THE SMOKED WINGS!!! Don't get the regular deep fried.. Trust me.. They also have really cheap drinks and a patio with a great view.. Check it out don't be lame"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The atmosphere is awesome especially during the spring/ summer when everyone is outside. Drinks are a little pricey regularly but they have good drink specials during the week."}
{"text":"We wanted greasy good food and we got it! Not the best service, but that was to be expected."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lunch is amazing. Great atmosphere and location. and the chicken pita is dynamite. Great value and great food. Repeat customer."}
{"text":"Cute place. The service was very good, really nice friendly waitress. The food was good. I had fish tacos, they were tasty. My husband's ribs were very good. My daughter tried the buffalo chicken salad and she really liked it. I would absolutely go here again."}
{"text":"Lots of regulars hang out here! I like it! Always good beer specials and you can't beat playing some Golden Tee with a couple friends.  I've been impressed each time I've eaten here too. Good seafood selections. Always enjoy myself when I stop by."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting here. It was before the weekend lunch rush, so we were seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and thorough. The food was hot and delicious. I thought the french fries were amazing. If you like patio dining, you'll love this place. It has great views of the lake and boardwalk area. Also, don't forget to check in with yelp; you will get 10%off your meal."}
{"text":"UNCC location - Fun ambiance; sports on tv; Not incredibly loud like other restaurants at lunchtime. Great food! Had the steam pot...Yum!!!! A must if you like seafood! Hubby had the shrimp tacos. He was bummed that he only got 2 regular sized tacos rather than 3 he gets at other places. Service was spectacular. The server (Sharise?) and manager went out of their way to ensure a wonderful dining experience. Lots of selection for beer and cider. Would have been a 5 Star review if Hubby wasn't whining about the portion size. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting family. So we decided to come to the boardwalk to grab an early dinner!  The restaurant is really clean, and the staff is super friendly. The fried green tomatoes were SO GOOD. The coconut shrimp was pretty good too. Wings were also great. However, my burger kind of sucked. So there's that.   I was pleased with my overall visit though."}
{"text":"The first place I've been where I didn't like the wings at all. I had the BFF (Burger, Fries and Wings) as did my daughter and my wife had their Burger, Fries and Fingers (BFF). I all cases the burgers came to us hockey-puck well done. The waiter was not really attentive as he began by getting drinks for a table who arrived after we did. After we were served our meal he didn't stop by to see if all was well. We waited 20 minutes for him to come by and then voiced our problems to him. Also note that the wings had no flavor and were actually tough. There are too many options out there to give this a pass."}
{"text":"Huge menu! Also a great cocktail menu. The food is delicious and service was also great."}
{"text":"So glad I found this location which happens to be much closer to my house. I got the steam pot $18 with crab legs, shrimp, oysters, potatoes and corn. OMG the best thing you ever had in your life. Everything was seasoned perfect and I loved everything. The staff was really nice and overall I liked it and will surely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. I realllly loved this place. The atmosphere is great, bar staff was friendly. Food was great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic waitress. Everything about this visit was excellent!! I ordered the ultimate steam pot and it was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I didn't have very high expectations with the name, nor the decor, however after leaving the place we were like, that really wasn't bad.  They seem to many specials, and many drink specials.  So many drink specials it becomes rather confusing.   I really liked the chili nachos.  The peanuts at the tables were a nice addition too, addictive though.  We didn't eat here, but we might go back for drinks again in the future."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and tried this place for dinner as it was close to my hotel. I got shrimp tacos and the chicken fingers with fries.The tacos were ok..a combination of not enough shrimp in each taco and each taco being drenched with too much sauce. I've had better. The chicken fingers were bland. If it weren't for the batter it was covered in, it would have been really unappetizing. Service was fast. The friendliness of the hostesses and servers could be improved though, but I probably won't ever come back here again (unless it's for work again) so I guess it really won't matter to me!"}
{"text":"A sports bar type of place featuring ribs and seafood.   Not a bad place to stop in to catch a game, have a drink and meal.   The food is decent with the ribs and beer can chicken being the stars.   Prices are reasonable, service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The location is hidden in the back of a shopping center your GPS won't pick it up so keep your eyes open. When I got out of the car I was greeted by a regular that was outside smoking and she was super nice. I then went into the restaurant and sat myself. I took a look around and the first thing I saw was a large board with a NEW BEER selection which was a decent amount of draft/bottled beer of all types.   The menus is pretty diverse from seafood, wings, sandwiches, and more. I ordered a founders porter (beer) which was $4 not a bad rate and the Party platter($25) of seafood. The food was good but no vet much seasoning on it and not enough to fill you up. If your hungry either upgrade or don't get the Party platter. I then ordered the smoked chicken wings and they were amazing!   The service was really good, beer was ice cold, specials daily, and if you like to talk to regulars sit by the bar."}
{"text":"Cool spot sitting right above the water outside people watching. Seafood tasted frozed and not fresh never a good look for a seafood spot. Bikers were in the way of the service staff slowed service down a lot. Might return for lunch"}
{"text":"We stopped be Boardwalk Billy's Raw Bar & Ribs for a little afternoon delight but we were not delighted by the Hurricane Punch bowl we ordered! This colossal sized drink looked appetizing but it turned out to be a $22 glass of watered down punch flavored with raspberry notes and a pleather of ice with a orange slice draped over the side!   The Hurricane punch was so bad that we asked for a shot of something to give it some flavor! Aaron our server offered to bring us a $6 shot to pour in the drink!  FYI if you happen to come here for something other than the Hurricane watered down punch make sure you know exactly what you want because All mixed drinks are final sale!  I'm not impressed by the drinks or the service we received at Boardwalk Billy's!   I appreciate the owner reaching out concerning our experience so we will give Boardwalk Billy's another try!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  I wanted the Jamaican Jerk chicken but had to settle for the buffalo chicken wrap. At that point it was a disappointment for me.  My wife and daughter loved their meals.  Hopefully the next time they will not be out of jerk chicken."}
{"text":"Very good food, very nice atmosphere, courteous staff, great location. Their burgers  are very big, and juicy! Great wings, and fried pickles! I will definetly frequent this place. Bill wasnt nearly as much as i expected, for the amount of food ordered."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual bbq restaurant on a spare of the moment basis and found BWB on a google search. Very nice experience, albeit small inside, but that added to the 'fun' vibe inside where we were greeted with a friendly atmosphere, attentive server and good quality food and beer.. topped off with a game of musical bingo! Nice."}
{"text":"while the view on the deck overlooking the water and ducks are very nice it doesn't make up for the small portions. I ordered a 2 meat combo, brisket and sausage. the brisket tasted ok (not great just ok) but it was only 2 very thin slices. and the \"sausage\" was nothing but a plain hot dog wiener grilled. now I suppose an Oscar Meyer wiener technically is sausage but I definitely felt cheated. at $17 they could have at least given me 2 of those \"sausages\". I will never go back"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place! Lyndsey and Kelcei were awesome. Super friendly and would engage with all their customers. Knowledgeable about their products offered and helpful. Beer on draft is awesome, best selection I have seen in a long time and food quality is amazing! I will be back many times over"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during a recent visit to Charlotte, based on it's close proximity to Ikea.  I really enjoyed the pulled pork barbeque sandwich with mashed potatoes (and for $5.99 at lunch- it was a steal!).  Hubby wasn't quite as impressed with his meal, he ordered the B.F.W. combo (burger, fries, wings).  Burger was barely lukewarm and they gave him their regular wings instead of their \"best in the area\" smoked wings, which were just average.  But what we really liked about this place were all of the homemade barbeque sauces they offer with your meal (the sweet & spicy one was fantastic- I wish they'd bottle and sell it).  Service at the bar was friendly but a little slow (hence the almost cold burger), but in their defense it was New Years Day before noon.  I'd like to come back on a warm day and enjoy their waterfront patio.  Even with the less than stellar burger/wings, we definitely wouldn't rule it out when on that side of Charlotte again.  Those sauces can make anything taste good!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hit and miss. I have been here a few times, sometimes music is good, sometimes not. Sometimes service is good, sometimes not. Sometimes food is good sometimes not. Sometimes live music is good, sometimes not. In other words you better role the dice before heading over and hope for the best. The End"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Boardwalk Billy's. We were looking for somewhere good but not a chain place after a long drive into town. I was pleasantly surprised given the ratings were lower here on yelp.   I ordered the ribs with fried green tomatoes and baked beans. He ordered the BFW (burger, fries, and wings). We shared a Mac and cheese. Everything was great, so great I asked the waitress to find out what was in the Mac n cheese. Got a recipe so that will be my next culinary experiment.  The four different sauces for the ribs were run-of-the-mill but not spectacular. The south cackalaky and the western were my faves. A good  beer selection, including some tasty local ones.   Overall, a good experience, pleasant staff, good food. One drawback was the peanut trash on the floors from the peanuts on each table weren't really cleaned up. However, that's barely worth the mention. I would definitely return. In fact, I'm tempted to break a rule and go to the same place twice in one trip."}
{"text":"Love this place - great locations, very good food and a great variety to suit everyone's taste.  Great beer selection and lots of free peanuts!!  I've been here a couple times, most recently April 28 - Prom Night for some.  I was told there was a 90 minute wait for a table, but found a seat at the bar.  Within 30 minutes we were seated outside on the deck which is really nice at sundown.  I tentatively tried the BBQ, but was very surprised at how well this non-BBQ place pulled it off.  Would definitely go back for more.  Really fun and energetic staff, place is not a romantic setting - little noisy, but fun to hang around in and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"One star is one too many. We will never go back. Our greeting was not, \"Welcome to Billy's.\" Instead, these out-of-towners were told, \"Show us four valid North Carolina IDs.\" No smile, no friendliness. Just an incredibly rude greeting. I can't imagine service any worse than this anywhere."}
{"text":"Got the B.F.F. (Burgers, Fries, Fingers). It was delicious! Greasy in a good way- yum! The portion was very healthy and I have plenty of leftovers. Service was pretty good. Waitress was super ditzy, but nice. I used the YELP check in coupon and the manager never saw anyone use it before and let my entire table use it toward our bill. Overall a great experience with pretty good food."}
{"text":"I am from LA and this place be ghetto! The drink specials are cool, but the food is whatever's. I had crab cakes and steamed shrimp for dinner. I could have taken the food out of frozen box, and served it myself."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tons of fun and good food. I love the laid-back atmosphere there. I also enjoy the good drink specials especially on college nights. I would go there almost every week to hang out with my neighbors and have a blast.  I love the fact that it is on the little lagoon there. It makes me feel like I am actually on a boardwalk having a nice lunch/dinner.   The low country boil is my favorite dish there. It is good hearty food, but healthy.   LOVE this place."}
{"text":"A solid choice for bar food - a nice burger or wings. My wife has had the soup a few times and like it, too. My daughter usually gets the wraps. I find myself eating the peanuts at the table while I wait. Service has always been good.  I've been here a lot, and have never had a bad experience. A lot of places can't say the same."}
{"text":"I never write reviews about Restaurants. However there is a time to start. First off let me start by saying the wait staff was excellent. Now to why I am writing this review, my wife ordered a drink off of their drink menu, she took a sip and did not like it. So we asked the waiter if we could replace it with a different drink.  Unknown to us there is a policy that if you by a drink you have to keep the drink. So I asked to speak to the manager night. I told him that we would like to exchange the drink. He points to the menu that they have a no return policy on drinks ordered. (lol) Now call me old fashion but I have never been in any restaurants that had that policy. So I told him ok well since you are forcing me to buy the drink. We will pay for the drinks we had and the appetizers and we are leaving. He goes to get the bill and returns saying. \"I did not know you place your order\" you will have to pay for the order placed.  Now once again that is a new one. So I asked where is it written that I had to pay for food that is not bought to my table? He threaten to call the police because we were going to leave without paying for the food.  (lol) I said I am offering to pay for what I consumed. He couldn't answer the question about having to pay for the food. We were asked to leave and never come back.  What I don't understand is this, we ordered over $90.00 worth of food. However instead of reaching an agreement over an $8.00 drink you give up $90.00. I am surprised they are still in business. Wow what an unbelievable experience.  Sorry can't review the food since I never received the food."}
{"text":"Crab dip is the best! Depending on where you're seated, it has the best views of the boardwalk and cute ducks!   The offerings range from BBQ, Seafood, Pub-like foods, and salad - of course - for a reasonable price.  Their staff is really friendly! I love the mobile system they utilize to text you when your wait is up. It's perfect for giving extra time to browse the boardwalk before eating.   It's located directly across from the paddle boats so it'll make a good date or Sunday Funday location!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I thought it was alright. My boyfriend didn't really like his wings though. He said that his wings were too dry. If I remember correctly I got the burger, wings, and fries. I thought that it was good and it was a pretty good deal for it. May try this place again whenever I'm in the boardwalk area"}
{"text":"Great place & prices for seafood in the UNCC area, with mostly college students in/out. There's a enclosed patio sitting over the man made pond & a regular patio amongst the mini boardwalk.   Kayla was our super star server, as she handled all three of us simultaneously & with a smile. Especially in dealing with my old school Newark Godmother, she has no cut cards...if she didn't order Shrimp, don't put them on her plate LOL.    My Mahi Mahi tacos were blackened to perfection, yet a little dry as I was able to consume any of the tasty sauces. Yet, I made my own concoction of Tabasco Sauce & a couple of dressings & was good to go. The Sweet Potato Fries were really on point. Godmother got the Fried Flounder Platter that came with Mash Potatoes, Coleslaw & French Fries. My Goddaughter had the CrabCakes, & we all dined happily in the sun.   Kayla thanks for being a super duper trooper in serving us, we'll ask for you when we return."}
{"text":"The manager and/or bouncer was about as rude as could be. My wife didn't have her iD so he pretty much made our visit as unpleasant as possible. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I put off going to Boardwalk Billy's for a long time. We purchased a Groupon last March, but it didn't expire until this April, so we've been pushing it back in order to use other Groupons that expired sooner. Now with April fast approaching it was finally time to see what ol' Billy had to offer.  Boardwalk Billy's is located in that...boardwalk-esque area set up in the University area. It is a nice location being right near the water, and there is plenty of space to wander around in order to walk off your meal and drinks. There were some nice outdoor seating options but it was a tad too chilly to do that, so we ate inside. I was surprised to find there was a fifteen minute wait at 6:00 on a Saturday, simply because this was one of the first times we've had a wait at a restaurant since moving down here. It ended up being shorter, and we were eventually sat.  Boardwalk Billy's offers the tableside peanuts so you are encouraged to chuck your shells on the floor. We partook of the nuts (keeping our mess in a neat pile on the table) while perusing the beer menu. There were probably close to twenty beers on draft to choose from, and most were either local or national microbrews, which is always refreshing to see. I went with NoDa's Hope Stout ($4) and the missus had the Big Boss Countess ($4.) After the beer arrived we placed our dinner orders, and it arrived shortly after. The menu is pretty solid, with choices ranging from BBQ to seafood to plain ol' sandwiches and burgers.   First thing I want to mention is that Boardwalk Billy's looks like your typical bar/hangout spot. What I didn't expect was to find the food was far better than what you would expect at such a place. I ordered the four bone rack of ribs ($9.99) and they were some of the best I've had down here. The ribs were not heavily sauced so you got more of the smoke and natural pork flavor, which was awesome. There was also a nice \"crust\" on the exterior of the ribs, and that bark was nice and crispy while the meat underneath was succulent, moist and flavorful. For the sides I ordered a salad ($1.50 upcharge) with balsamic dressing and mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was not the best, but not the worst. The consistency and texture were spot on, but the flavor was a bit lacking and mild. On the other hand, the salad was the star and totally worth the upcharge. This wasn't a cheese side salad...this was a real salad. It comes in a huge bowl and had some mixed greens, diced tomatoes, carrot slices, crispy croutons and...BACON!!!!!! I would never expect to get bacon as a component of a side salad, yet it was there and it was chewy and flavorful and plentiful. They definitely didn't skip with the cured pork and it made the salad totally worth it.   The missus ordered the shrimp tacos ($9.99) and they were pretty scrumptious. It came with two big soft shell tacos full of shrimp mango and pico. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the overall flavor was downright tastetacular. As a side she ordered the fried green tomatoes, and these things were crazy good! I don't like tomatoes but I had to try a fried green, and boy am I glad I did. A side comes with four huge slices that are battered and deep fried and served with a tasty sauce. The green tomatoes are so thick and firm that I didn't get that nasty mushy feeling I get from regular tomatoes, and the batter coating was great. The dipping sauce was a touch spicy and complimented the tomato very well. I ended up stealing two of her tomatoes because they were so darn good!  Don't let the look of the place fool you...they know how to cook and serve great food. Sure you can come here for a beer and bar grub, but it's done better than your average bar would do it. The BBQ is some of the best I've had in the area, and I'm surprised to find myself valuing their BBQ over other places I've been to that specialize in nothing but the 'Q. If you don't mind the loud noise and crowds I'd definitely recommend giving this place a visit. I definitely know we will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a date night on Wednesday, (I know awkward date night, but as 2 busy business professionals, we have to make time when we can). Lol. It happened to be trivia night which I would have loved to participate in. The music was nice and the overall atmosphere was cool and laid back. I could definitely see myself hanging out here in the summer time. I ordered the turkey burger and chicken tenders with some fried green tomatoes. The turkey burger was dry but had a nice flavor. My counterpart ordered the fish tacos. He said that they were (cool) so that could mean a plethora of things. He's not a foodie like myself so I cant really say if \"cool\" is a good or bad thing. I would come back just based on the atmosphere alone. I cant wait to come hang out n try some of the other things on the menu this summer. I will also be participating in trivia night as well!"}
{"text":"Great Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap , he crab con queso is amaaaaazing!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab some lunch or have a casual dinner with some beers. One of my favorite parts is the basket of peanuts you can munch on while enjoying your drinks and waiting to order food.   My favorite item on the menu is the chicken pita. The pita is soft, the chicken is tender, and the sauce is spicy and flavorful.   Overall, it's a nice casual place to eat and drink with decent prices."}
{"text":"Came in last night for dinner and a couple beers. Food was excellent got the burger with fries and a cold red oak. Sat at the bar & was completely ignored the whole time. No one asked if I wanted another beer while My glass sat empty. 3 bartenders working and it was not busy. They kept walking by, looked and looked away. They all seemed in a horrible mood. Like I said the food was great but the service was super shitty."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday. Great place and really good drinks. Brianna was our hostess and she was fantastic. Very attentive in spite of it being a busy night. Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"I was really excited to take my out of town guests to this place. Figured it would be a great atmosphere because it was on the lake. Have been here for lunch before. It was around 9:15 pm Saturday. We were stopped and asked for our ID then told we had to pay a $5 cover charge each because there was a band starting at 10pm. We told the bouncer that we were just in to have dinner. Said sorry it is a $5.00 cover charge. Being that we already made the trip all the way here we paid the cover charge. Never heard of paying a cover charge to eat burgers, but really wanted to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.  Oh and no band ever showed up.  Never again. Also, my guest went outside to make a phone call, and at least ten people walked away because of the cover charge.  The place was completely dead, and they ended up losing customers over a $5 cover charge."}
{"text":"I hadn't been back here for a while and last night was a perfect occassion. It was late and we were looking for a casual place to have a drink. Billys is in a great location, but isn't anything special. It's just a fun spot to have drinks and be merry with friends.   On Monday, they had $4 washington apple shots, and $2 domestics. Sat at the patio until about 1am and it was a gorgeous evening, morning."}
{"text":"Your typical dive bar. They give you complimentary peanuts, but boardwalk Billy's has never been an \"I have to go there\" type of establishment for me. Food is decent, usually just get wings when I head out there. Mozzarella sticks are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Had the 12 Oyster plate.  Were so good had to order 6 more.  Best oysters I've ever had in my life.  Wife had the coconut shrimp and they also were most excellent.  Service was great and had a great table overlooking the lake.  What I like about this place is that the tables are not jammed up against each other like in so many restaurants.  Plenty of room.    so excellent  food, service and reasonable prices.  5 Stars for Boardwalk Billies"}
{"text":"My must have menu item for any visit is Fried Green Tomatos. I enjoy the other location off WT Harris because they have the actual boardwalk"}
{"text":"I first tried Boardwalk Billy's with a client who requested we go there because he liked to watch the ducks... I had a grilled chicken salad and he had the low country boil. The salad was a salad, but the boil looked great and the sample I had was delish! It was a MOUND of food, seriously. Probably a legitimate 2 pounds of corn, potatoes, sausage and shrimp with a dusting of an Old Bay type seasoning. After this experience, I decided I should go back when I could eat like a cow and really try the place on for size! The BF and I returned on the following Saturday. We were able to get a table outside and were ready for the real trial. The service was slightly above average and the beers were cold. I got the pork plate and he got the pork and ribs. It was so good. The pork was tender and melt-in-your-mouth good and the ribs were literally falling off the bone. The sides weren't anything remarkable, but were definitely good. The ambiance is great and the food is pretty good. All in all, a good place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with coworkers, I had the blackened chicken pita. It was very delicious and the chipotle ranch alongside was yummy. My coworkers enjoyed their food as well.   As far as decor the place has a very beach feel, cute ambience, casual and not too collegiate (considering the area). The majority of the customers were also business professionals so that was nice. I may have to come back to try their drinks, they have an extensive beer list and mixed drink menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my two favorite Bar & Grills in Charlotte. The food and menu are perfect! A great lake front setting. Lots of TVs, a juke box, a full bar. What more could a man ask for. I go usually once a week. Check the coupon clipper for a free entree or appetizer coupon."}
{"text":"Eaten here a couple of times now.  The location is great... it's tucked away from the road, but it's worth it since its out on the pond.  Makes for some nice ambiance when you are eating... I'm sure it's especially cool to eat here outside next to the water on a nice summer night.  Decent lunch specials that include your drink (soda or sweet tea) so you don't have to have your food with a water if you don't want to.  The menu has your normal bar food, but has some seafood options as well.  There are also peanuts that you can munch on while waiting for your order.  Watch out though... people like to throw the shells on the floor instead of the empty basket on the table... go figure~!"}
{"text":"Service was lacking. Not sure if it was due to it being after midnight. But we had to keep flagging down the bartender when we needed something. The place was nice and I will come back and give it another chance. However if I get poor customer service again I will not return."}
{"text":"After my last experience here, I will NEVER go to this restaurant again. The service was awful and I have never left a restaurant feeling more disrespected and offended. I won't go into detail about what happened but just know that over the past few years I have frequented this restaurant with friends and even brought visiting guests to this place - so for me to say I will never go back is a big deal. This place obviously does not care about preserving its customer base whatsoever.The worst part is that I wish I had this experience sooner so that I could have stopped going here sooner and they wouldn't have gotten as much of my money as they did. Hopefully they will get better management and make some serious changes at this place."}
{"text":"I am in town for the Jimmy Buffett concert tomorrow night.  My spouse and I checked out your restaurant online ahead of time, and purposely chose Boardwalk Billy's for dinner tonight. We were really looking forward to some of your entree choices, but after being seated and then sitting at the table waiting for our server for over 10 minutes, we left. This was after several servers walked past, looked at us, but never stopped. As we walked out, there was even a group of staff gathered at the hostess stand.  Don't worry, we found another establishment to spend our money in tonight."}
{"text":"Crab legs were great but the service was typical college bar style. Could have been better for the price. Good beer selection though!  I would come again."}
{"text":"We were going to Famous Toustery but it was an hour wait and my man was hangry so we walked over to Billy's. The service was good. The food was meh. Just. So. Basic. I mean if you can't tell by the name of the place and the interior decorations. I wouldn't be so much of a hater about this basic place if it wasn't so damn overpriced. When you are hungry, there's nothing wrong with basic food. But wayyy over priced basic food? Ugh. My hangry boyfriend even said \"this is a restaurant for suckers\". He said CookOuts food is wayyyyy better (for basic food). Well I guess that makes us suckers but I will be our last"}
{"text":"Under the Boardwalk we'll be having some FUN! Under the Boardwalk.. BOARDWALK !    Boardwalk Billy's truly has become a staple in the University area, as well as on the UNC Charlotte scene. The laid back atmosphere and sociable staff always make my trips to Boardwalks the most enjoyable. The restaurant and bar space is extremely functional. There's ample space to move about and people watch as you grab a bite to eat or a quick drink with friends. Speaking of food while you're here do yourself a flavor and try the Buffalo Wings. Your tummy and taste buds will thank you. And if you so happen to have a taste for a spirited drink, Boardwalk's has daily drink specials. My favorite special is the Thursday night special. You and your friends can enjoy \"$2 U Call Its\" while listening to some upbeat mixes from the house DJ. And if you're lucky, you and your friends might catch a glimpse of the local \"smooth criminal\"  (a Michael Jackson impressionist). And what could be more fun than great food, good drinks, and a show?!  So grab some friends and make your way to Boardwalk Billy's for some food and fun."}
{"text":"A glance at other reviews shows that quite a few people haven't received good service here at Billy's. After trying to go in one night and being stopped for ID and cover charge, I decided I would only return during the day. I have been twice, both times mid afternoon and thankfully never had an issue with service. So far I've only tried their burgers, fries, wings, and crab cakes. Normal bar food but it hits the spot every time.  Looking out at the water and the ducks in the lake from the patio is always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This may not be a fair review, but when reading others, it prompted me to call before I decided to go over for dinner.  As we really like oysters, I called to ask the price for them.
