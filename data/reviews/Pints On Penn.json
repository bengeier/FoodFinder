{"text":"I had such a wonderful time here! The bartender was one of those guys with the mustache and suspenders. But not at all a jerky hipster! Gave me and my friend amazing service during our  meal. The food was a bit different than normal bar fare, but everything we had was really amazing, especially the wings which were just wonderful. It wasn't too crowded which I enjoyed. Might have to make this a weekly get away!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Lawrenceville and am really bummed this restaurant wasn't around when I lived there. We came in with a large group and ended up sitting on the outside patio that is upstairs which was perfect during the summer.  The beer selection was impressive, I'm a big fan of ipas and there were plenty of craft options to choose from. As well as lagers, porters, stouts and pale ales. Our waiter was super awesome also too. Very knowledgeable about the menu and the drink specials, make your own mules!  I had the fish tacos which is one of my favorites and these might be the best ones I've had. And if you like spicy food and your a vegetarian the buffalo cauliflower is a must. The owner even made sure to stop by our table to make sure everything was perfect. Overall I know that if I lived in Pittsburgh still I would be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"First time at Pints on Penn. Love the neighborhood bar atmosphere. Great food and awesome selection of beer. The staff is professional and even the owner stopped by to introduce himself. Well worth the trip"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment twice so far and both experiences were just okay. The first time they were out of the black bean burger and it was only noon. Now they no longer have the item. The second time, service was slow in the bar but I do not blame on the bartender. I ordered fish tacos and some how got the fish sandwich. We waited at least 10 mins until we got a menu and even the manager was present. It took the food over 40 mins to come out, it shouldn't take that long to fry a piece of fish and make a chicken wrap."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary last night at Pints on Penn, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience!   From our starter of Chicken Nachos to our dinners -- Turkey Club for him, Southwest Chicken Wrap for me -- our food was beautifully presented and mouthwateringly delicious.  Our server Kyle was attentive and upbeat. He made us laugh, and provided for us a truly enjoyable evening.  Thank you Kyle and Pints for a great anniversary dinner - we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here on Saturday, our first time here.  It's a really comfortable 'neighborhood' bar/restaurant to come to; relaxing and friendly! There was a private party upstairs, so I don't know what was available up there, but if it was noisy, it didn't infiltrate downstairs! Our server was really helpful in suggesting some different beers for us, and in explaining items on the menu.  Do not miss the buffalo bleu-cheese cauliflower; I am now a BIG fan! The caprese grilled cheese was also really good, and of course, the cheese-filled pretzels. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. You have to try the bacon appetizer. The portion sizes are huge and the taste is great!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. Been here twice now. Bacon, wings, pretzel and City Chicken sandwich were all great. Love the bare ass blonde (it's a beer). Cool atmosphere and loves the bartender Maya."}
{"text":"Minimal beer list /taps Beer was flat  Bacon great ! Service fine Well was looking forward to a great beer selection / taps? Hoping  things with beer will be tweaked"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. No chicken, no fish and no turkey available after we ordered. Took 15 minutes to get our alcoholic drinks and never got our waters. Our entrees came 45 minutes later and the appetizer came after that with the nachos dried out and cold from sitting. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Food is more than incredible.  Beer selection was great!  Unfortunately I didn't get the meatball burger but I will definitely get it next time I go back.  Hats off to the staff who took great care of us out of towners and the cook who made it a point to ask us how much we enjoyed our food ... I can't remember the last or even first time that has happened.  Looking forward to going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos....amazing!!!  Also had for appetizers the pretzels, the bacon and the stuffed  avocado and the tuna tar tar.  All very good and very tasty!  My cousin got the city chicken sandwich which was very good, I will probably get that next time!  The portion sizes are huge and well worth the money.  We had a great time and enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"I went here recently for dinner with my girlfriend.  To start, we got fried pickle chips, which were tasty and the best part of the whole night.  Next, I got the grilled cheese and my girlfriend got a turkey club.  My grilled cheese was completely cold in the middle (cheese wasn't even slightly melted) which was a bummer because it might have otherwise been a good sandwich.  My girlfriend's turkey club was pretty good and the bacon they used was delicious.  Our service was pretty mediocre however (waitress was AWOL most of the night) and it got pretty loud inside, which I always hate but was to be expected because this place was seemed like a pub first, restaurant second."}
{"text":"So today called to ask if they take reservations and was told no. We arrive with our party of 7 for my husbands birthday. We arrive and there is a sign on the hostess stand \"dining room closed for private reservation.\" Didn't get to try the beer or food but when I call on the day of why don't you tell me you have a reservation that you \"don't take\" tonight so we don't plan on dining there. If you want to take a group here to celebrate, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"In my youth, I would often go to the dive bar that was in this location previously. It is amazing what they have done with the space... and the food is pretty good as well. Very reasonably priced but a word of caution - the portions are large! One appetizer and two entrees were more than enough for two of us. Service was great and decent draft list. The menu is pretty limited so it would have been nice to see some specials, but I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a pint and a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Not the best restaurant I've been to, not the worst. The draft list was good but the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I travel frequently on business and know a thing or two about eating out.  I happen to be down the street practicing at the Bikram yoga studio (give it a shot, it's a hot, difficult workout) and walked by the bar on my way back to my car, it was early evening.  I could smell the food coming from the kitchen and it smelled heavenly, so I decided to give the place a try.  Earl the bartender (he's the hombre) was great, he could explain the craft beer, the menu, and the history of the remodeled building as well.  Earl's mom may be a gypsy, but he can toss one ice cube behind his back up over his shoulder and into the glass, quite impressive.  I love red beers and ordered the Camp Slap Red, it was delicious.  I gobbled down the generous half size portion of the hand carved turkey & bacon sandwich and it was delicious.  I was able to watch the Pirates lose to the Braves, but that's baseball.  I think you should give this place a shot, see Earl; and for those yelpers that gave a poor review, you need to get out more often so you have something to compare the place to.   Regards"}
{"text":"First timers there... wow! What an evening! The food... so unique and my goodness the flavors were amazing!!! Loved the menu and the creativeness! Cool beer selections! The house made perogies were ridiculous! Candied bacon, buffalo cauliflower, burgers and wings... also had the brisket nachos... there were 7 of us so we were able to sample each others dishes... everything was on point!!! Will definitely be back!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Pints on Tavern is located on Penn Avenue shortly after where Butler and Penn Split.   It's hard to miss with the alluring bright lights that line the top of the outside of the pub.  The inside has a saloon /modern type feel. There's plenty of seating downstairs and I believe upstairs is available for private parties. When I walked in I immediately felt cozy.  The food menu is quite unique.. \"City Chicken Sandwich\"!   I tried the appetizer \"Sweet & Spicy Bacon\" caramelized bacon on a skewer..  so different and tasty~!   The baked spicy buffalo cauliflower was interesting. I don't normally eat cauliflower but it was good.    It was a comfortable visit and the staff was on the ball and friendly.  I love that there is a jukebox too! Off street parking.. not too bad finding a spot.  I look forward to visiting Pints on Penn again and trying out something on their Draft Beer Cocktails menu."}
{"text":"Poor service. The waiter was poorly dressed in a dirty low cutoff sleeveless Tshirt. He was not very professional and used vulgar language at times. Food is just okay - nothing special. Have not returned since this experience."}
{"text":"It has been decades since I travelled to this part of Penn Ave.  Gone are the dilapidated row houses ... beautiful well cared for homes have taken their place.  This restaurant is directly across the street from Stephen Foster's home.  This establishment has 2 floors.  First floor bar & dining.  Second floor all dining. No onsite parking.  We started out with periogies, house salad, roasted romaine salad ... and the best buffalo cauliflower ever.  Rather than breading or slathering with butter, the cauliflower is roasted with blue cheese dressing, (very) hot sauce, & a few secret ingredients.  Highly recommend.  For dinner, we ordered caprese grilled cheese sandwiches and chicken nachos.  It was definitely an adult grilled cheese on thick sliced bread.  The chicken nachos were plentiful and loaded with flavor.  The menu was diverse.  Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I first got to try this place out at a fabulous Yelp event. I was excited to go back for dinner and take my fiancé who had never been.  We sat downstairs in the back which was cozy and right by a huge TV so we could watch the Pitt game. I went with the Arsenal Cider they had on tap and they always have a great beer selection. For my entrée I went with the cobb salad which was very tasty with a lot of fresh ingredients.  I was very excited to see that they offer a late night brunch on Sunday night-what a cool idea and we had to go back with my monthly brunch club.   Loved eating breakfast at 7 pm on a Sunday night after a Steelers win!  The brunch menu only has a few options and I went with the bacon, egg and cheese burrito which comes with exactly that plus tomato in a whole wheat wrap. The prices are very reasonable-all entrees between $6-$7 but you do not get a side so make sure to order anything else you want.  Everyone else in our party ordered the tot bowl which comes with spicy sausage, egg, cheese, onions and tater tots in a large bowl. It was a hefty portion. We also got the French toast to share which was delicious and the syrup was not your typical Aunt Jemima.  If you are not feeling brinner they do have their full menu available plus $5 drink specials on select beers."}
{"text":"I am really pulling for this place to succeed.  I am not entirely sure if it will, but not because of the quality.  It's slightly off the beaten path (on a busy, primarily residential area of Penn Ave.), and there is some stiff competition in the area (namely, Butler street).  Still, it's an incredibly solid bar/food place, with an adequate outdoor deck which seats a handful of patrons.  We had bloody mary wings (pretty tasty, even though I've been extremely skeptical of chicken wings ever since watching Bar Rescue), and VERY strong fish tacos.  Fish tacos nowadays isn't descriptive of food, it's like saying \"sandwich\", wide open interpretations.  These kind of breaded, with a delightful sauce and thinly sliced avocados.  They also had fresh nacho chips, the kind where they were thick and warm.  Unlike those awful brittle chips, you could shank somebody with these babies if you smuggled them into a prison.  Scrumptious.  We enjoyed two beer cocktails, the buffalo trace candied bacon one (solid, but i won't seek it out again) and the Pomegranate Cranberry Ginger Shandy, which is worthy of the hype in these other reviews.  However, this is something that I feel hasn't been said enough....THIS IS THE BEST BLOODY MARY IN PITTSBURGH.  It's not even a bloody mary, it's a bloody maria (tequila instead of vodka).  It is truly superb and one of the cheapest mixed drinks on the menu.  I would intravenously consume if it if my veins had taste buds.  We asked the bartender about it, and he puts a ton of effort into it.  He stuffs the tomatoes with garlic, and roasts them until they burst, and that becomes the main mixture.  The drink also has cracked peppercorns, which give it a nice little hint of spice, which blends well with the tequila.  You could hate tequila but still love this drink.  GET THE BLOODY MARIA.  All in all, Pints on Penn is a super solid place, but it may be a knife in the gunfight that is the Lawrenceville, I am pulling for this place.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A BAND/MUSICIAN: Husker Du: Very good on their own, but overshadowed by other popular 80's alternative rock bands like R.E.M. and The Replacements, which hindered their ability to find success."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad time at this spot. Ever. They have a cute little outdoor seating area. The bar is large. The upstairs is roomy and would be great for a smaller event. The service is wonderful.  The vibe of this spot feels really familiar, comfortable, casual, easy. The bartender and wait staff are friendly and patient. Sometimes my friends and I can be loud pains in the ass, shocking I know. I came here after swimming, we sat outside. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and split some fries and a sandwich. The food is really very good for being \"bar food\". Though I'd categorize this place more of a pub feel than a regular american bar. Something about it just feels so right. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood pub feel.  They have a nice selection of drafts.  The beer cheese stuffed pretzels are awesome."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. Lots of potential to have a classic pub in the neighborhood, but this place is pretty much a South Side style bar with REALLY BRIGHT LIGHTS.   Upon entry the bartender handed us a menu and then told us the kitchen was closed. After that, we watched him flip bottles around like he was Tom Cruise in the movie \"Cocktail\".   I am sure there are folks out there who will dig the vibe at this place. I just don't think it will be anyone from the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went here for a yelp event, but checked out the bar downstairs before the event. We got the fish tacos which were a little over fried and heavy on the mayo. The chips and pico were really good tho. We got wine and beer, they have a good selection of drafts and bottles if you like beer. They also have beer cocktails, which I didn't try, but looked really cool."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had, honestly. Brought my gf's parents here for dinner and was actually embarrassed. Beers mixed up. Food came out at completely different times for each person, so no one was eating together. Numerous incorrect plates brought to the table, then confusingly brought away mumbling something about the proper plate being en route. One time we were told \"oh I think someone ate it\" regarding my gf's meal. Table behind us got up and left because they were never waited on. Another couple ordered two beers, only to have one brought to them. The other showed up ten minutes later. Server brought us a check, then never returned to get the payment. We finally had to go find her, standing around downstairs. Terrible. Will not return. Shame...because the food was actually delicious but there is no excuse for this service.   Edit: My girlfriend reminded me of two more things.... one, despite all the order mix ups and frequent returns to ask questions about orders; the server did not at any point attempt to write anything down. This may help alleviate the issue with orders. The second problem I forgot...when my girlfriend finally got her entrée, it was the wrong flavor (The Vegan Falafel Bites). It was also after the rest of us had finished our meals. She gave up, and ate it anyway but did say it was good!"}
{"text":"Cute lil place I've never known about before.  Found it in a \"let's find a place near the 31st street Bridge\" venture. bourbon/beer cocktails! Great beer selection. Very attentive staff- Earl was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place and our favorite bartender, Earl!  My roommate and I love coming here because the drinks are great (I'm a huge wine drinker and I found a cab I loved here ... Even happier when I got it at the store and realized its less then 10 a bottle!).  The food is also pretty good... I wouldn't call it 5 star worthy but it's decent!   The menu is also pretty expansive for a small place.  Def worth checking out but keep in mind it's a small place in the corner.  It's not meant to be a 5star restaurant.  Fun spot!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested we try this place as it was new in her neighborhood and I obliged.  Let's start with the atmosphere and staff.  The building is newly renovated with a modern yet antique trend that follows Lawrenceville and has plenty of large flat screen TV's to satisfy during sporting events.  No objections there.  The staff were extremely friendly.  We also went at 9PM (kitchen closes at 10), and the waitress was fully attentive and didn't slack off as an end of the night type thing.  The drinks.  Didn't get any as we were both tired from the gym, but they had a solid selection.  Have seen bigger, but since this place just opened I'm assuming they may add in more options or update their main draft options every week.  Good selection of craft, domestic, and liquor though.  The food. VERY good.  I had the City Chicken Sandwich and my girlfriend had the Southwest Chicken Wrap.  The city chicken was a fried pork tenderloin with gouda, carmelized onions with a spicy mustard sauce on a flaky bun.  Came out piping hot and the breading for the \"fried\" portion was great.  That's another thing, as I said it was late, but the food didn't look like it was a last ditch effort and sat out before plating.  My gf's southwest chicken was almost better than mine.  Myriad of flavor in it, and the fries with both were good as well.  All in all, try Pint's on Penn.  It's a nice welcome addition and I think they are hitting on all of the right marks.  Good service, good chef, and good drinks.  Can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"I am not really sure the type of experience in which I expected, but I can't really figure out what to say.  MEH!  There was nothing super exciting about this night, nothing memorable.  From the moment we walked in, it had a weird sorta \"like sitting in my basement and hanging with my buddies\" (albeit a cool basement with art for sale all over the walls).  The food was average at best and the service was almost too casual.  Not really sure what else to say.  Maybe it was an off night..."}
{"text":"This is a quite promising venue!   I think it's new enough that they're still getting into the swing of things.  I think there was a miscommunication between the hostess and server.  After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes before flagging somebody down, as we hadn't even been served water yet.  Our server was very apologetic about the mix-up, and took some off of the tab to make up for it, which was quite nice.  A few tips for the owner:  - The upstairs is pretty loud.  There are a couple of small black sound-absorbing blocks, but they need much more.  Window treatments would do wonders to help, but I still think it'd need more.  - I got the city chicken sandwich, which was good.  But was lacking in dimension a bit.  I think mostly because it had no sauce.   I think it was supposed to have a mustard sauce.  I was thinking that something sour and/or spicy would go great with the cutlet.  - My girlfriend got the pork chop, which was tasty.  But she had mentioned that she'd have preferred a double-cut chop as opposed to two singles.  The apple brine was good, but not very noticeable.  If the apple brine is intended to be a focus, then maybe some apple slices w/ cinnamon on top as a garnish would really bring it home.  It's currently got some growing pains, it seems.  But we'll definitely be returning to see how it goes."}
{"text":"After leaving another establishment close by due to an excessive wait for a table, we ended up coming to Pints on Penn on a Saturday evening.  We sat at the bar that was completely empty.  There was maybe two other tables in the bar that had some patrons at but otherwise that part of the restaurant was not busy.  So we bellied up and ordered a drink.   I started with the Fig on the Rye.  Tasty not too strong but still packed a little punch.  They don't have an extensive draft list, but they do have some more options in bottles.   Looking over the menu I decided to try their Field Greens salad. It came with apples, grapes, walnuts, and goat cheese on spinach.  Sounded good so I added grilled chicken for some protein.  After a little bit of a wait the food came out and I was really hungry so I dived right in.  The salad overwhelmed me but not particularly in a good way.  I love goat cheese, but there was just so much of it, it really overtook the salad.  And the chicken was really grilled, I mean some of the pieces were black.  So burnt it left that really unappealing taste in my mouth, combined with the over-the-top amount of goat cheese not a tasty balanced meal.  What sounded delicious did not deliver, top it off they forgot my walnuts.  I was like I think this was supposed to have walnuts but the other things going on there kind of distracted me.  I still ate every bit, basically due to hunger pangs and not wanting to go through the whole this salad tastes awful discussion with the bartender.  I did ask the bartender when I got her attention to confirm that the salad was supposed to have walnuts. She said, \"Yea what they didn't give them to you?\"  I said no they did not.  She offered to get me some but by then I was about done with this carcinogen loaded plate I declined saying it's a bit too late, but thanks.  So finished up and left, kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Everything tastes home cooked and from fresh local ingredients. We were testing their vegetarian offerings, and they passed with flying colors. The acorn squash cheese dip is delicious and rather creative. The salad is over the top great, with lots of goats milk cheese, fresh greens, apple slices, and walnuts. The portobello mushroom sandwich was fantastic.  The twice baked sweet potatoes were savory, sweet and well worth ordering.  I especially like their craft beer selection which includes local breweries such as Grist Mill and East End.  The service is attentive and helpful. Prices are extremely reasonable.  The building goes back to 1880, but they have recently updated and remodeled. It's a little way out of the way, not on the main drag on Butler, however I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"My friend saw this place on Groupon & we knew we had to check it out. Anything with \"pints\" in the title intrigues me, haha. They also are new- only open a couple months, so we were excited to go. We went on a Monday night- found parking easily on the street & it wasn't very crowded inside. There were 5 of us & we found a spot easily on the second level of the restaurant. Our server was very nice & attentive to us the entire evening. Their draft list was decent in size- I went with a fruity IPA, it was delicious. They had beer cocktails, which was awesome. My friend ordered a beer that came with a smoked jalapeno inside (it was in the drink menu- the drink will be different depending on what porter they have on draft at the time). He loved it.  For appetizers we ordered the Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple, Spicy Chicken Nachos & Fried Pickle Chips. The Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple was our favorite. It was everything fall in a delicious appetizer. It wasn't too spicy but it was very flavorful & delicious. The Spicy Chicken Nachos were also a hit- they weren't super spicy but they were delicious. The fresh avocado on top was the perfect addition to the chips, chicken & cheese sauce with Pico. On their own, the chips were a little too salty, but overall we really liked this appetizer. The Fried Pickle Chips really weren't anything special. They were good- but not really memorable. My boyfriend & I weren't too crazy about the Guinness mustard that came with them- we enjoyed dipping them in ranch instead.   Monday night is wing night- so three of us ordered some wings. For 50 cents each we couldn't pass up the chance to try some of their wing flavors! We ordered: 5 spicy dry rub, 5 hot pepper jam & 5 of the special that evening (honey spicy BBQ I believe?). The dry rub were good- definitely tasty. The hot pepper jam wings were a little disappointing. The jam didn't stick to the wings & therefore they were a little tasteless. They also weren't spicy at all- they were really sweet. The flavor that was on special that evening were the BEST. Super good.  For our sandwiches, our group ordered: the stuffed meatball burger, the city chicken sandwich, two grilled southwest chicken wraps and the roasted turkey club with house bacon.  My friend who ordered the stuff meatball burger LOVED it. Mozzarella cheese was literally dripping from the burger- it looked Awesome. I had the opportunity to try the city chicken sandwich (PORK for anyone who doesn't know what city chicken is)- it was definitely really yummy. It was also huge and my friend couldn't finish it. The two peeps that ordered the grilled southwest chicken wraps seemed to enjoy them as well.   But I have to say that I ordered the best sandwich... the roasted turkey club with house candied bacon was IN-sane. It was HUGE. Thick slices of real turkey breast, thick slices of house candied delicious bacon LOADED high. This thing was a building basically. The flavor did not disappoint at all either. I was only able to eat 1/3 of it that evening. My boyfriend & I ended up splitting the remainder of the sandwich into two sandwiches & had that for dinner two days later.. so this one sandwich literally was 3 meals.. it's that big.   One bummer about the sandwiches is that they all come with fries- they don't have other sides available. My friend did ask to switch her fries out for a salad- which was a $2 upcharge (not bad). The fries weren't super good- we ended up eating some for leftovers but then just throwing the rest out.  Overall this place was awesome- I would really like to return for the turkey club in the future, as well as a cold beer to go with it.  Check this place out asap!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great atmosphere! The food was awesome. My favorite was the bacon appetizer never saw anything like it. I have been there several times and tried several different items. The stuffed pretzels were great and the Buffalo Cauliflower very different and great for vegetarians. I went with a party and the most popular amongst the group were the Fish Tacos. I had a few beer cocktails, which I have never had before. The Watermelon Shandy was refreshing.  Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"The actual bar is a really nice, old wooden bar.  The rest of the place is just so so and uninspiring.  We got our drinks pretty quickly and then almost never saw the bartender/server again.  It wasn't particularly busy; bar wasn't full.  We order a STARTER and were clear we wanted to START with that.  All of our food came out together about 30 minutes later.  At which point we had empty drinks and never saw our server to get another round.  It was just disappointing, honestly.  I will give her credit for comp-ing a beer for the issue but a little service goes a long way to make up for other issues. On top of that, it was maybe 7pm, still light out and some REALLY drunk people stumbled in and completely changed the atmosphere with their yelling and total vulgarity.  Bars can't always control patrons but it was obvious they shouldn't be served repeatedly."}
{"text":"A group of friends & I were visiting Pittsburgh and we decided to stop here for dinner and drinks.  I am so glad that we did! They have a great little patio we sat at, and the service was quick and genuine.  Everyone in our group was impressed with how delicious the food was! Their pierogies are easily the best I've ever had, and their fish tacos are delicious as well.  Several people in our group had the sweet & spicy bacon skewers and could not stop talking about how good they were, so I would recommend trying those! I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Pittsburgh, there were so many items on the menu I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Awesome location settled in a quite neighborhood.  Great and friendly service with amazing food!"}
{"text":"Chicken Caesar was great. Very fresh, it's more of a traditional salad made with romaine lettuce.   The stuffed meatball burger was huge and very tasty. It's kind of like a giant meatball with cheese inside. The marinara tasted fresh and was spiced nicely. Had a little bite to it. The fries that came with the sandwich are truly great. On par or better than anything in the city including the Belgian establishments.   Nice draft selection and friendly staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great waiter! Great outdoor patio! This place has a great atmosphere with a cool bar down and upstairs with a great view from the patio. I will be back again! Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves here for the NL playoff game between the Pirates and the Cubs. We had a group of 10 and got a nice table in the bar downstairs right under a tv for the perfect viewing experience. My husband and I shared the chicken nacho appetizer and it was  great! We will definitely be back for entrees and the good beer selection. Our dining companions all got entrees and everything looked appropriately portioned and delicious. The fish sandwich in particular looked really good.  Also, I really like the old bar that was salvaged from the previous establishment."}
{"text":"After being ignored at the church brew works we walked down here and had a great experience.  Great little lineup of some fantastic beers.  Our bartender was our server and she was great!  I didnt eat but others love the half priced appetizers during happy hour.  If I lived nearby this would def be one of my go to joints.  Nice job here!"}
{"text":"I recently purchased a groupon for this place, as I am always willing to try and explore new establishments. This place seemed more of a gastropub, which I am always excited about. We came here on a Friday evening, and were promptly seated. The service was really fast and efficient. I got the seasonal sangria which was made from watermelon juice and apple cider. Totally loved it. My partner got the Guinness beer which he was very happy about. We got the cauliflower buffalo for the appetizer. I loved the buffalo sauce and the bleu cheese. I got the fish taco for my entree and was quite pleased with it. It came with generous amounts of guacamole, other fresh ingredients and a side of nachos. Overall, as other reviewers mention this place lacks a cool factor associated with other establishments in Lawrenceville, but is a more calm place for a quiet friday evening dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Love the old school feel, the place ia drafty and was chilly so we moved up stairs. Staff was great, and attentive, place was clean. Food was good, the bacon appetizers were burning my mouth but I just kept eating. .it was so good. My fish sandwich was good but a bit greasy. But the french fries are to die for.. if in the area we definitely will go back. Would have liked to see more on tap, specifically more local brews, we have many around to choose from."}
{"text":"You should try Pints on Penn! You haven't tried Pints on Penn because you didn't know it existed but now you do...so try Pints on Penn!  They have a nice variety of beer, which is not for me but my eating partner was very satisfied. I thought the beer cocktails were really cool and I would have tried one if I didn't get obsessed with the Watermelon Ginger drink! It had fresh watermelon and ginger beer. It was really great.  We order 3 apps that were really good! Brown Sugar Bacon- 5 fat strips of bacon all covered in brown sugar with a mapley cayenne dipping sauce= win! Stuffed zucchini- super fresh veggirs stuffed a home grown zuke. It was topped in cheese snd served with marinara. It was good but I wanted some sausage stuffed in there! Stffed avocados- This was my fav! The avocado was grilled and stuffed with a corn salsa. The ingredients were supper fresh and the chips were homemade. I loved!  We didnt get a chance.ro try the entrees. During HH, the apps are $2 off and beer is $1 off!"}
{"text":"Update - 6/14/16 - This place is a disappointment. I want to like it because I live so close, but it's not even average. I won't try to convince myself anymore that the next time will be better. I don't think this place is going to last much longer. They need Bar Rescue...it's a nice setup, but this bar looks like it's run by a rookie.  Great new place! Since I live less than 12 steps from their front door...I think I'll be back again! And again, and again. When I walk in everyone says, \"Heeeey, Norm's here\", but my name is Tony."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible food and service. It's just another bar with an okay vibe. Don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it. My girlfriend and I were looking for a late night dinner with great appetizers, and we stumbled upon here! We go two plates of wings, and some chicken. The wings were phenomenal. The dry ranch and barbecue wings hit the spot. They were meaty, properly seasoned, and proportionate. Our waiter then told us about some of their specials: half price wing night, and all you can eat taco Tuesday for 10$ a person. We will definitely be attending those days.  This is not a family restraunt. It's mostly a bar, and there are minimal tables. It is more of an adult friendly restraunt, but older children would be welcome. Overall, I was very impressed with the food, and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place has potential, but they aren't quite there. I went for dinner; (FYI dining area is upstairs, long staircase). It is clean, make shift pub feel, all tables, open layout, not good for private or cozy seating..*that's just preference, nice for what it is*. The food all looks great, but nothing was too good. Twice baked sweet potato  (sounds good right!) Were flavorless, broccoli almost raw and barley warm, pork chop was nice though. Friend reported her food as just okay. I think the downstairs area is much nicer, cozy, warm..and I would definitely go there again for drinks and apps that seem difficult to mess up like their pretzels. Nice beer coctails..nice waiter. Go for drinks, eat dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Disappointing draft list. With a name like Pints on Penn I expected a great beer choice...of the 5 or 6 selections offered only 2 were available, bottle selection was lacking, not even local brewery selections. Staff seemed in the dark...not very helpful. Enormous single person restrooms...very nice and clean, just seems like a waste of space."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Pints on Penn by a recent Yelp event and then returned a week or two later when we arrived to Morcilla early for our dinner reservation, which is just a three minute walk away. The place was quiet for a Friday evening, and we easily found a spot at the bar. We didn't try any of the appetizers and just stuck with a couple beers. I had Grist House's Gristly Bear Brown which is an absolutely incredible beer. Even though I had a sneak peek of some of the food at the Yelp event, I definitely want to come back and try some appetizers when I'm not on the Yelp event clock."}
{"text":"I saw a groupon for Pints on Penn and had kept forgetting that it existed. I figured if I bought the groupon, it would make it a point in my head to go. I ended up going that night and I definitely have a few opinions about the restaurant...or maybe I don't.  We sat in the bar area. It seemed like the only person there was a bartender. I didn't know there was an upstairs area until I saw people coming down from some stairs. The bar area was pretty empty. Although, I really liked the big, original bar.   I don't remember my beer but I ordered salmon on a bed of wilted spinach with mashed red skin potatoes. The wilted spinach was just that...spinach on a plate with the fish put on top so that the heat wilts it slightly. No salt. No pepper. The salmon was done a little closer to well which is definitely my preference. it was the best thing about the dish, as it was blackened and that makes everything taste better. The mashed potatoes were good as well but overall, nothing was great. My boyfriend got a salad and didn't like it. However, that is his problem because his complaint was that his SALAD \"had too many vegetables.\" I don't really think I can factor that opinion into my review. I would come back and would like to try other items on the menu but I don't know if I would go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"We ordered 80% of the app menu, we really just came here to watch the pirate game but omg everything we ordered was fantastic. Service is decent the clientele is so lax. Don't fucking leave this place until you have the cauliflower app it was like sex in your mouth."}
{"text":"Truly, I'd give this place a solid 2.5 stars, but yelp isn't about that life.   A friend of mine lives close and convinced me to try it out. Groupon was running a deal and I heard good things about the place, so I decided to venture out on a frigid Friday evening and try it out. I walked into the bar entrance that had a decent amount of patrons there watching some sort of game, and wandered looking lost past a bunch of employees who didn't seem too interested in letting me know it was a seat yourself sort of situation. There was a hostess stand, but I've yet to determine what purpose it serves. Seriously, dudes...a sign would have been nice.   I liked the feel of the upstairs, as there was lots more room and plenty of tables. I sat and waited for my friend and was served water and menus by our friendly server. We saw that there was a cranberry ginger shandy on the menu for $3.50 and each decided to get one. It was delicious, and I noticed quite a few other diners enjoying various drafts as well. They definitely had an expansive beer menu full of things I'd never heard before which is always a good sign in my book.   After having read some reviews, I decided to order the turkey club. My my friend went with the blackened tuna that came with sautéed spinach and red skin mashed potatoes. Our food took awhile to be brought out, but it was okay because we gabbed and gabbed. When our food arrived, my turkey club was ginormous. It was so big I only could eat one fourth of it. I loved the thick carved roasted turkey, the house made bacon and the bread it was served on was delicious. It had some mayo on there too so it wasn't dry. It was a solid turkey club and only $9, including fries. Unfortunately my fries were overcooked and lukewarm.   My friends dish was a total flop. She had me taste a piece and her piece of \"blackened\" tuna was completely cold. Cold as in, they made it and waited for someone to go slaughter the damn turkey for my sandwich and then served it to her cold. The tuna was not blackened but yet only slightly grilled. The mashed potatoes looked watery and my friend said they were the greasiest mashed she's ever had. It legit had pools of grease around the sides. I'm not sure how one messes up mashed potatoes... Luckily when we alerted the server he offered to either reheat it (yeah...like that'd be any good...) or get her something else. She went with a grilled chicken wrap that came with fries. She said it was \"meh\" and picked at half of it and then was just done altogether.   As if this visit couldn't have gotten anymore odd, the check came. When my friend re-ordered, the server mentioned it would be half off because of her troubles, but when the check came we were charged full price for her wrap, but $6.00 each for the shandy we had instead of the $3.50 that was quoted on the menu. Though our server was entirely friendly the whole time and did a great job refilling my water, he was slammed with other tables and we didn't want to cause another ruckus about the incorrect check, especially since we were using the Groupon. We paid and left, giggling about the weird experience the whole walk home.   All in all, the service was nice but the food was a miss. I'd come back to this place for drinks only maybe sometime when the weather is nice, as the patio looked nice in other people's reviews."}
{"text":"We went to Pints on Penn for the extraordinarily disappointing Wild Card game, but fortunately Pints on Penn did not disappoint. Their upstairs area would be a great place to keep an eye on a few games at once, and the food is a welcome departure from standard bar food. The bacon was great, the pierogies were fine (PGH Pierogie Truck sets a high standard), and the Wednesday special cheese and meat plate was quite tasty, with really nice sauce options. Wednesday special also includes wine, but the wine list leaves much to be desired. The real advantage (beyond the array of not completely deep-fried food options) is the great (quality, not length) tap list, including Strongbow for $5. FIVE DOLLARS. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After a visit for a happy hour and drinks with friends I finally got back for a second visit. This time we sat on the outdoor patio. It was really nice with a great view of birth the church and park across the street. We also got there pretty early on a Thursday afternoon so we had the deck to ourselves. Much like the previous visit the rotating beer selection was very good and the house specialty drinks were as well.   We ordered several appetizers for the table. Nothing spectacular. A stuffed avocado, zucchini and bacon. They were all very tasty though each seemed to be lacking that extra something to take it over the top. The avocado needed just a little extra salt, the zucchini could have used a fatty element like sausage and the bacon needed a little heat on the back end. These are all just nit picks though as they were very good. The most striking pay was they were made on premise with fresh  ingredients. This to me makes all the difference. Speaking to the waitress who was very friendly and pleasant, she made it known that the chef is very much about fresh homemade plays and is working to remove all frozen/pre-packaged items from the menu. This is a very encouraging development indeed.   All said I really like this place and highly recommend it. It's location is not conducive to walk up traffic so a concerted effort to go is necessary, but in my opinion worth it."}
{"text":"Beautifully restored bar, intriguing mixed drink options, decent beer list, and tasty, ample portioned Pittsburgh-centric food like city chicken and chipped ham stacker!  Another worthy Lawrenceville pub.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the Grand Opening weekend of this restaurant. We decided to check them out for lunch. When we arrived it was a tad confusing. We didn't want to go into the bar but the dining area. We headed to the area that the sign out front was pointing to but half way up a waitstaff person opened a side doer and let us in. We were taken to the top floor and we were given the option to eat there,the patio/deck or the bar. We decided on the bar. There were two tables to choose from there. Two of the waitstaff gave us the history of the place. It's always interesting to hear. About an older building. There was a couple in there who had been in the building many times through the years so it was neat to hear what they had to say.  The menu has a lot of options but is not overwhelming. I've always preferred a place that does a few things really well rather than a poor performance on a menu that is enormous. For a place like this we thought their beer options were not that great. In fact we decided not to order any.  So back to the food menu we went. I ordered the Gouda and Cheddar Mac n Cheese with bacon. It looked good but had absolutely no flavor. None. I was very disappointed. I had them box it up for me and I took it home for one of my boys to eat. I'll add something's to it to give it flavor  My husband ordered the Piitsburgher Ham BBQ Stacker. It came with a side of fries. It was stacked all right. Almost to high to get a bite but we did. We ended up halving it since I didn't like my food. There was a ton of Chipped Ham and the slaw on it was very tasty too. The fries ate house made and better than a lot of house made fries I've had in the 'Burgh.  The building has been totally renovated and they did a nice job. I just wish they had a better selection of beer and that my food had some flavor. It was also a little awkward because music would play for a few minutes and then it would be silent for a long period of time and then a few more minutes of music.  If I ever go back, it would be to have the BBQ Stacker again."}
{"text":"Snagged a Groupon and decided to give this place a try. We were there early on a Saturday night and when we arrived there was only one other table of diners in the upstairs dining area. The upstairs section is surprisingly roomy, and by the time we were finished with our meal, the room was packed!   I started with a ginger snap cocktail which was sweeter than I expected (I prefer a spicier ginger beer) but it was pretty darn good and I slugged it down. My husband got a hot toddy, but when the server delivered it to the table, he apologized and said that it might not actually be very hot. Something about the water not boiling long enough? Anyway, it was a cold toddy and my husband felt funny asking them to make one that was actually hot, since the server was already aware that it was a not-hot-toddy and didn't seem too concerned about it.   Food was average. We ordered a bowl of Mac & Cheese with bacon to enjoy as an appetizer. And enjoy we did. I'd have to say the Mac & Cheese was our favorite dish of the night. My husband's fish sandwich was huuuuge, but otherwise nothing special. My fish tacos were good, but pretty heavy on the spicy mayo. I love spice, but the heaviness of the mayo really masked all the other flavors in the tacos. The homemade tortilla chips were good, but some were way overly salted, and others had no salt at all.   I appreciate bars that are trying to do something out of the ordinary with their menu, so good for Pints on Penn for offering some interesting selections, but notice how many \"buts\" are in my review. There were a lot of buts."}
{"text":"The place is ok. The food is mediocre and mostly standard bar fare, although they have some interesting takes on appetizers, like buffalo cauliflower. The downstairs is mostly a bar, and they have an upstairs with a dining area and attached balcony. There are TVs everywhere giving it a sports bar feel, but that is not the crowd that seems to hang out there. They are very proud of their trivia night, but honestly.... isn't the point of going to a bar to talk/meet people, good beer and food? I don't kow about trivia night,  but they fail to impress on the beer and food perspecive."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! Great food and big beer selection. The deck out back has a great view."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Rumor has it that they are changing up the menu a bit and it's much appreciated!!  Have been there several times and haven't had anything I didn't like. Pierogies are amazing!  Homemade and have some extra flare. Weekly specials give a variety and add to the menu. The house made chips are delicious, my only request is that they be added to the menu!"}
{"text":"The reason that I came to Pints on Penn was for a Yelp Elite Event, YEE. I had the best time ever at this event so maybe my five star review for Pints on Penn could be because of all the wonderful food and drinks I got to try. But I really think event or not, I would have been really happy with the service, food, and drinks here. I even went and told my work ladies that this could be a happy hour spot to try out.   I live in Lawrenceville and have wanted to come to Pints on Penn for so long but have always skipped it to go some place closer to where I live on Butler. Am I lazy, not really but there are a lot of places that are closer to me and quite frankly Chris never wants to branch out if he has found a go to spot. (Anyone want to be my try new places date?? :-))  The food was amazing. The drinks were so good. And the space is beautiful. I can think of nothing more fun than an evening out at Pints on Penn. And when I heard they have pretty good happy hour specials it makes them all the more enticing.   I thought I would be adventurous and got a Pomegranate Cranberry Ginger Shandy for my first drink. In hindsight this was a bad decision for me. I am not the biggest fan of beer and should have just tried a cocktail instead. I liked it but it was not for me. I like smaller drinks and for the amount of food that I was eating I needed something a bit smoother. It was good do not get me wrong, but not to be sipping while eating all that food!  Pomegranate Cranberry Ginger Shandy: Barrow's ginger liqueur, pomegranate molasses, topped with Leinenkugel's cranberry ginger shandy  Now my ride or die, De, got the ginger mixed drink. It was so good. I went on the website to try to find it but could not. I loved this drink. I would have drank this all night long. But alas, I only got to have a sip. Their cocktails were really good and I cannot wait to go back to try more of them.  Food: I stuffed my face. In a very ladylike way. But the food was so good that I had to go up for a second plate even if I was full to the brim.   Baked Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower: Baked and tossed in our house buffalo and topped with blue cheese crumbles.   I think that I am now a bit wimpy because this cauliflower was amazing but it was hot. I had to ask for a cup of water to just try to get through it. I couldn't stop eating what was on my plate but it took some time to get through.   Fish Tacos: Breaded, fried, and topped with pico de gallo, pickled red onions, spicy mayo, and red cabbage.  This was the stuff. First the tacos came in corn shells. BOOM. Corn shells are my favorite and more \"authentic\" to the idea of tacos. Tacos that come in regular wheat shells always make my heart hurt a bit. Second, the pickled red onions were amazing. I may have taken a lot extra just to eat on the side. Crunchy and pickly, so good. Third, the fish was fried perfectly. The mayo was spicy but not overwhelming. I loved it.   I am now drooling thinking about those tacos.....  I had a great time and now I know what I am missing if I do not go back to Pints on Penn soon!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome. The turkey club might be my favorite sandwich of all time! The delicious candied bacon absolutely makes it, and they roast the turkey too. The bartender was super friendly and gave us a cool history of the place. Will definitely be back and looking forward to the patio in the spring!"}
{"text":"Avoid. Crowded, drafty, noisy. Mediocre food at best. At least they could offer Arsenal Cider but NO. Better off going to the Sharp Edge."}
{"text":"I've been to Pints on Penn a couple of times. It's ok. I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. If someone asked me to go back I would probably suggest trying somewhere we've not been yet."}
{"text":"Came here for a Yelp event. Was surprised and impressed to hear this establishment has been running for decades and was recently remodeled. The venue itself is quite small (but has two floors).  In terms of drinks, the ginger shandy beer cocktail was very good. It was refreshing and sweet without being too sweet. They have a bunch of other beer cocktails as well. My dinner companions tried the fig on the rye drink which wasn't so great (per them). In terms of food, I really liked their mac and cheese as well as their fried fish tacos. Thought the food was better than your average pub food. They have crazy good specials every night so check in advance!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The drinks are cold and they have plenty of TVs inside and a nice deck outside!"}
{"text":"Went here and got a seat on their awesome deck. Loved the locale of this place. We started with the fried pickles, which are always a favorite for me. They were flavorful, and the spicy ranch was tasty.  I had the \"taco Tuesday\" deal, beef or chicken tacos for $1 each. I liked the chicken tacos; shredded chicken with tomatoes, lettuce, and red peppers. The beef tacos were a bit dry, but they were better than I expected for a buck. Corn tortillas were used, and those tasted fresh. The tacos did start falling apart as I picked them up, but that's to be expected. My friend enjoyed her grilled cheese sandwich. We shared her fries, and I thought they were crispy and flavorful.  Our server, Kyle (also the manager) was super attentive and funny. He offered so honest opinions about the menu, and had a great knowledge of all the draft beers and specialty drinks they offered.    Not 5 stars, BC the food was not anything great, but service and locale made up for it. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I MISSED THE BACON but stayed for the drinks.  Another couple joined us for drinks here after a night at the Improv. The place has easy street parking and is on the bus line. We came for the bacon but the kitchen had alreayd closed. We stayed for the drinks. That was the best decision of the night. The craft and specialty drinks here are well made and super tasty. I fell in love with the \"Fig on the Rye\". House made fig jam with Bullet rye? The best drink I have ever had. This is coming from a beer drinker.  Speaking of beer they also have a nice draft list and bottle selection. Not as many drafts as you would think with the name \"Pints on Penn\" though.   I was alerted to the groupon by our bartender and bought 2. The bartender was super nice and the owner actually helped my friend my giving her house made cherry syrup to add to her beer instead of grenadine.   After being so highly spoken of by the bar staff I can't wait to go back to try the food. Update to come."}
{"text":"First time visitor . Taco night. Tacos were pretty good for a buck a piece. Beer was flat and rather warm and at 7 dollars for a draft that is unacceptable. I had wings, they were lukewarm and rubbery .Daughter had the steak salad which she said was very good. I will give it another try and see if it's any better. Nice looking place I'll give you that much. Hopefully next time the food will impress me."}
{"text":"For a casual, relaxed atmosphere, great food and friendly folks, this is the place.  The 3 guys that own it are always there to say Hi and the wings are the best I have ever tasted. My husband had the turkey club and it was fabulous.  And, oh, by the way, great choices in beer!  A vintage decor complete with tin ceiling and gorgeous wooden bar set the tone for a fun evening.    Karen B."}
{"text":"Up and coming local spot with very friendly and motivated staff. The owner Pat is great about making his guests feel welcome, even going so far as to share his closed WiFi with me when I posted up at his bar to run my fantasy draft - very cool of him to do so.   The staff ... Earl, Nikki, Christina ... are just great. Making small talk, drink suggestions and being generally good folks to meet that gives Pints the warmth you want to see in your local pub.  It's that sort of personal attention, folksy-ness and just plain coolness that made me say: \"Hey self, we just moved to the block buddy. We're new, they're new ... we're going to make Pints our new local kid!\"   *Should I be worried that I talk to myself in the third person? Hells no, mind yer own business! :-D"}
{"text":"We got a groupon for this place and it surpassed our expectations. The menu is small but everything we had was great. The drinks were unique, and different. We had the buffalo cauliflower,  fish tacos & the filet sliders. Everything was delicious including the fries and chips. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The inside is clean and nice decor.  They gave an outdoor area upstairs which is cool.  $1 tacos on Tuesday!!! Nice staff and good selection of beer.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The server Kyle knows the menu and drinks. Knows the perfect suggestions. The appetizers are awesome ... Bacon on a stick!"}
