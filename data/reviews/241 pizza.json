So, I asked him whether he was going to give me the fresh slices? The man yelled at me and said they are all fresh... I told him that I preferred the out of the Owen slice.

{"text":"I noticed that there are a lot of reviews for various 241 Pizzas, but none for the location on Gerrard. My above ranking is for this particular location and not for the chain as a whole.   I live about 300m from this 241 and go there frequently. Their walk-in specials are amazing ($10 for a large with 3 toppings) and the slices are cheap too (I think it's $3.50 for two slices and a pop).   I would say that the pizza is not as consistent as what you'll get from a place like Pizza Pizza, where it always seems to come out exactly the same, but their worst pizza is probably better than the best one I have ever had from Pizza Pizza (not adjusting for Pizza Pizza's consumed post drinking).   The best thing though is that the guys that work there are really nice guys, always good for a short conversation generally pretty happy.   The only bad thing is that the 241 central ordering process is absolutely terrible. You end up on hold forever and the prices you can get over the phone are terrible in comparison to walking in."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza but never got as far as seeing what it looked like, let alone tasting it.   The moment I stepped inside the store, I was hit with a strong smell of urine. I then noticed someone in the back of the store shuffling around with aprons on his feet. It looked like he was trying to mop something up. Given the smell I can only assume they had a sewage leak of some  kind.  What is disgusting is that they were continuing to cook and serve food. If i could give this 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Lived at Kennedy&Eglinton for many years and have always been a customer. The pizza there has always been filling and decent tasting for $3.50. Portion sizes of pizza are very generous (hence the name 241) and the place is open really late which makes it ideal for late night snacks. Granted it does look really old, messy and greasy in there, but they have a good DineSafe record surprisingly. They have some walk-in specials as well that are really cheap. I would definitely prefer this place over the nearby pizza pizza at Midland. The slices are larger and have a lot more flavor in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great pizza deals and really friendly staff! I usually grab the slice and pop for a quick & cheap lunch, no more than $5.  Best Hawaiian pizza I've ever had.  I go to this place over the Pizza Pizza down the road just so I don't have to deal with the rude assholes that work there."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. Never have had an order wrong and their walk in specials are really great. Their pizzas are always made with fresh ingredients and they have some interesting topping options such as tandoori chicken! What I love the most about their pizzas is that they are not dripping with grease and I never have to use a napkin to remove it."}
{"text":"This 241 restaurant is sketchy. Employee took my order on his calculator and accepted cash without providing a receipt. Then proceeded to prepare my pizza in plain clothes, when another employee walked in off the street and started preparing the food in her plain clothes as well without a hair net. No aprons or any sign of hygiene, how do I know you didn't walk in from cuddling with your cat? First and last time I'll order here."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza every time! It's fresh flavourful and when you ask for xtra cheese you get it!!!!"}
{"text":"I had their veggie pizza slice and I liked it.  I liked the fact that they had a halal option which I am going to try next time I go. If I want a veg pizza or halal pizza I will go to 241 Pizza.  If I want a cheese pizza or specialty pizza I would go to Pizza Nova.    My husband has been going here for 14 years.  He says it's not as greasy.  And the prices are better.   I like Pizza Nova better, but I still liked 241 too.  But my husband liked 241 better than Pizza Nova.  We both liked 241 better than Pizza Pizza.    All locations are also not the same.  I found this location better than other locations I have tried.  My husband says the same.  And the owner here is a good guy - a good family man."}
{"text":"I've only been once and would never return.  The pizza was sub-par.  Plus I noticed the guy behind the counter handled my money and then worked the next pizza without washing his hands.  Ugh!!"}
{"text":"Not as good customer service as before."}
{"text":"No Frills brand Chicken Nuggets passed off as \"boneless wings\" are you kidding me? The pizza itself was fine but the nuggets and my half full box of wedges made this a terrible experience."}
{"text":"The pizza here is always delicious, if you ask for a well done pizza you can expect a crispy crust. If you ask for extra fresh garlic like I do, you can expect a plethora of garlic gracefully placed around the entire pizza. To sum up, you can expect care to be put into your pizza."}
{"text":"Never again. Pizza is very plain and odd. Rather pay the extra for pizza pizza then this.   We had a panzo the other night and it had no sauce what so ever (inside) and that for us is a big no no  Anyways don't order 2 4 1 it's worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I had never heard of 241 Pizza until I moved to Toronto ... and I don't think I'd go back to any of my \"old\" favourites.  The pizza is soooo delicious.  As well, very cheap!  Walk in special - 1 large pizza,1 topping, 7.99 ... oh yum!  Also, the service is great.  They are so friendly!"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza place.. Their deals Are unlike no other! Where else can you find four slices of pizza w option of pop and chips for only 5 bucks?! Nowhere. Guy who owns this place is a true gentlemen. Very friendly and kind. It's really small there's nowhere really to sit down so it's more of a grab and go pizza spot. My advice go here and eat pizza on Christie pits just east of there!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday.  Ordered a meat lovers pizza and some of their brownies.  Super quick delivery for a Saturday night, I was told 45 minutes when I ordered, it came in 15!  Not much else to say really!"}
{"text":"Delivery has been good in past, but the deals including fries or wedges have for last few orders been underwhelming portions. Left with feeling of buyers remorse."}
{"text":"So came here with a friend tonight and ordered a pizza. Watching the old man make a pizza after reading a paper and not washing his hands prior to touching the dough was disapointing and then as we waited for our pizza to come out of the oven, I decided to take a picture of it as it started to come out to show my friends on Facebook.  Another employee flipped out at us and wanted $50 a picture.  At first I thought he was joking but he wasn't.   As we tried to eat our pizza .. he kept staring.  The pizza is okay at best but the service was horrible.  For that reason... I won't go back."}
{"text":"well, that was gross.  They seem to be unable to cook Thick Crust all the way through and your pizza will be a barely edible gooey mess.  I ordered the pizza online and they called 3 times to tell me they were out of different toppings.  We called and complained about the uncooked pizza and they promptly sent out another uncooked pizza to us.  In the end, i still ate the pizza, but it was pretty gross."}
{"text":"Paid the tip twice!!  Not very happy discovering I tipped twice and the guy delivering the pizzas clearly wasn't very honest since I gave me cash and he made me wrote it on the credit card statement (I am not from here so I din't think much of it).  I have no idea if it's this location or the one in parkdale since we ordered online and we are in between both location.   Clearly I won't reorder there!"}
{"text":"Good tuesday special. Well priced and the slices are big. Sometimes there might be a line up on tuesday. Place is very small and can be very hot during summer time. Staff are extremely friendly. They have special deals on whole pizza too. Place can use update."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this location. I love 241 pizza and the staff are great and when they deliver they are very quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"It's been around for as long as I have been in the area. I came here when there was nothing to eat around my work. Prices have always been very reasonable, and I prefer 241 pizza over Pizza Pizza any day. Came here to get dinner for the fam and they have new walk-in specials: 2 small pizzas + 2 toppings and they gave me a dipping sauce for around 10 bucks! People come to grab quick easy dinner, and not expecting a gourmet scene. Just your standard good ol pizza spot in the area."}
{"text":"the first time I tried a pizza from here, I wasn't impressed but it was a good deal via a walk in special. A second (and sober) time coming I actually investigated their topping menu and was impressed and able to make myself a tasty pizza pie.  They offer Tandoori Chicken as a topping, and you can even get tandoori spice as a free extra as well over the whole pizza if you want. Broccoli is also a hard to find topping which was a great combination. Round out with green peppers and I was digging into what I will dub the Indian Pizza. And this creation is why I'm giving this place 4 stars. Otherwise its pretty standard 3 star 'za."}
{"text":"Warning, Hilton guests:  This restaurant refuses to honor the 2 medium international pizzas for $19.95 deal in the Hilton binder. They want to charge $25.95 instead, regardless of their own ad."}
{"text":"I love coming down here after a late night for something to eat. The caesar salad is great and the boneless wings are a great treat. It's one of the only food places around this part of port credit that is open really late, I think I've been there around 11 pm once and they were still open. My favourite is the bbq chicken pizza,  I recommend it to anyone else tired of pepperoni pizza!   Over all, good place to get a late bite and a cosy place to sit when it's cold."}
{"text":"This place lacks customer service skills in surprised only 2 reviews are up. I ordered a walk in special and waited 30 minutes for my pizza and I was the only customer as per usual the employees likr to go in the back and talk to whole time, he apologized for forgetting about me  but i was his only customer theres no excuse and didn't even try to offer me a free dip or anything this place is crap and need to retrain employees."}
{"text":"Unfortunate. Have been a customer for 10 years. Has arrived cold in the past but this time order completely wrong. Including ingredient I am allergic to and dangerously undercooked chicken wings. Phone call produced standard indifferent response. Offered to give me email for head office. I suggested that head office could reach out to me.  I know...only pizza but still $40 merits something."}
{"text":"I have NEVER HAD A BETTER EXPERIENCE ORDERING PIZZA!   Walked in with two friends to order for a hungry group of six, and had two of the friendliest men with the sweetest most genuine smiles help us plan out what the absolute best deal would be for us with utmost rigor. We landed on 4 of the Walk-In Special: 1-topping large pizza for $7.99.  Pizza was decent, service was freaking uplifting. I actually had to restrain myself from hugging them."}
{"text":"Great place if you want a quick slice of pizza. Owners are absolutely lovely!   There is a special on Tuesdays; two slices of pizza and a pop for $2.50. Expect lineups; lots of students and hungry lunch goers.   It's not the BEST pizza i've had, but I can definitely tell you that it beats the pizza pizza down the block."}
{"text":"Better than pizza Pizza... But, still bad pizza. This location has lazy staff and often no pizza prepared. Avoid."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza,  some of the best I've had. Was really fresh. Great service. We walked in and ordered very little wait time."}
{"text":"This is the only pizza my BF will eat. It's not your typical 241 chain pizza. For some reason, the pizza here tastes soooo good. I don't know what they do but it's the best. Not greasy and the toppings are always fresh. We once ordered 241 delivery thinking/hoping it would come from this location, but unfortunately it didn't. We knew it as soon as we opened the pizza box. Barely choked it down. So now we always drive here and get take out. The guys who work here are really nice too. They start making the pizza as soon as we order and it takes like 9 minutes to bake. The ambiance isn't the greatest, and some of the customers are a little crusty/crazy...but once you have the pizza, you'll know what I'm talking about!  They also have a deal on Tuesday's -- $2.50 (tax included) for a huge slice of pepperoni or vegetarian and a pop. Be prepared to wait though. There's a sign somewhere that says \"2 slice limit per person\" but I've seen single people ordering like 2-3 pizzas worth.... I think the guys working here are just too nice to say anything."}
{"text":"This local pizza shop is excellent. All the staff are attentive. The pizza is always terrific. I often get the wings and they do a great job of baking them in the oven. They are serious about their pizza making and I really appreciate that."}
{"text":"For a slice this is a good option. They are usually fairly freshly made and always have plenty of options. Get a drink and dip as a combo for a quick lunch, it'll do."}
{"text":"The best pizza spot in the neighbourhood! Reminds me of New York style pizza by their thin crust & at a great price"}
{"text":"On a drunken evening when I was in Toronto I stopped at 241 pizza. You've been there, when you've had enough to drink that you have to have a slice or two of pizza and you need it now.  It's a small little pizza joint offering various specials. At the moment it could have been $100 and I would have paid for it. By the looks of this place I should have stayed away but alcohol doesn't bring out the wiseness in anyone.  I ordered two sliced of Hawaiian pizza and a bottle of soda. I think my total was around $6 USD. I wandered home where I soon devoured my pizza. The slices were much better than I anticipated and not because I was drunk, but because they were actually good. The crust was a medium density. The sauce was a little sweet and the ham and pineapples were plentiful.  This was definitely worth the price and the drunk me was very happy. A quick fix on a drunken stooper. 241 helped sop up the excess alcohol and eliminated my future hangover. And for that, I'm thankful."}
{"text":"241 Pizza is the place to go for cheap and greasy slices. I usually go to the Queen and Lansdowne location, but the pizza is pretty consistent across locations. They always seem to have  fresh slices on hand too, which is most impressive."}
{"text":"The absolute worst piece of pizza I have ever had. One bite and it went in the garbage! It was way undercooked. I would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"This is budget pizza at its greasy best. It's a chain, but there's a pretty big gap between this 241 and the others in the city I've been to. The staff are great, and it's usually really quick for them to turn around a pie or two. The cheese and sauce coverage is consistent, and I've yet to have a bad pie there in 4 years and dozens of visits.   It's 7.99 for a 3 topping medium (walk in) and the large is a buck or two more. I get pep, bacon, and hot sausage.    I only ever get slices or whole pizzas. So get their other menu items at your own risk.   With Greater Good in the neighbourhood now there's another good option for late night pizza - but if you're on a shoestring, this is a good get."}
{"text":"Basic, take out pizza, decent and OK. I go get one without any concern or problem.  Price is not that good however, and I still did not get how you can get the 2 pizzas for the price of 1 (2-4-1 that is the name after all of the place, right?)... it could be on Tuesdays only... or any day but only if you take a basic pizza with 2 toppings only... weird... weird also that I paid for the exact same pizza 10.50 CAD on Sunday, and 12.50 on Wednesday..."}
{"text":"Oh boy, what can I say about this place. This 241 location is just...Gross. That pretty much sums up the experience here.   The food itself is what it is...decent take out pizza and panzerotti - which is what I regretfully ordered after having to eat the whole thing with my bare hands, due to not wishing to use the dirty cutlery given to me.   My hands covered in grease is one thing, but watching the lady behind the counter pull out the plastic knife/fork from a dirty bin on the bottom shelf, casually wiping them off with a towel (though still leaving dirt stains on it) did not help with the appetite. Also quite unappetizing, seeing the lady behind the counter place pizza toppings into the dough with her bare hands, meanwhile taking a moment here and there to wipe her runny nose!   This entire location is just dirty. As soon as you walk in, you will see the stained and damaged floors, the uncleaned counter, the unhygienic area behind the counter, and the unkept display shelf where the pizza lay. I didn't look for it, but am VERY surprised that this place passed its Health Inspection. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I passed this place until the other half had a craving for pizza and suggested we try it.  I have to say that the first time we ordered it, it was AMAZING.  We have since ordered here when in the mood for pizza and it has been consistently tasty.  Decent sized pizzas with great taste.  I tend to like to make my own so their competition is my own cooking :)  When I don't feel like cooking and need a treat after a long week, this pizza is a good one.  Don't blink, otherwise you may miss this location!  It is right beside a gas station just off to the side.  We missed it the first time!"}
{"text":"This being a chain, there isn't much to say -- it's a 241. It delivers exactly what you'd expect from a 241.   So why write about it?   Because their hawaiin pizza kicks serious ass. I was surprised, cause their single slices kinda suck. They're dry and stale. But the hawaiin is made fresh, comes with double cheese and is friggin delicious. You'd think it'd be too salty with all that cheese, but it's not. Thick crust. Heavy handed toppings. Damn son.   Hands down, I'd order the hawaiin again. Single slices? Meh."}
{"text":"The worst customer service and pizza. Anyone that says  that this place has the best pizza, doesn't have much pizza or know anything about pizza. Soft soggy and doughy  crust to the point it's borderline undercooked isn't a good feature of pizza. Granted there was enough cheese , but just really the worst.  Go elsewhere don't bother with this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"My coles notes version on 241 = not bad and quite tasty!    I peg this one as my #3 fav fast food pizza spot. It is behind Pizzaiolo and Amato.  Often in a dire and starved state I will go to 241 and am never let down.   The pizza crust is thicker thin crust and slightly chewy. I find it awesome but some people might not dig that."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood pizza joint. I'm a sucker for their cheap Tuesdays, $2.50 for two slices and a can of pop. The medium and large pizzas walk-in specials are also my go-to when I need a pizza for dinner.   The guys there are always friendly and hardworking. Only once have they severely messed up the order. That's an amazing track record considering I've been coming here for over a year!  Now, it's not the best pizza I've ever had. But it's good enough considering proximity."}
