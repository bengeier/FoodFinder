{"text":"Service was terrible. We were there before les Miz, and we had an hour for dinner. We never got our meal until 10 minutes before the play and had to send it back, because we had no time to eat it."}
{"text":"This place is in the arts district where plenty of restaurants are and you can choose from many! Do not overlook this place!!   The service is impeccable! The mussels are to die for! The tiramisu was the best I've ever had! Love this place!!! A bit quiet, but so romantic and tasty!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this gem late one Saturday night. We were starving after a long drive and wanted something delicious that would fill us up. That's exactly what we got. For an appetizer, we ordered the arugula and radicchio salad with a goat cheese dressing. It was so simple, but so elegant and delicious. For the main course, we ordered the mushroom risotto and the gnocchi. Both were exceptional, but I have to say the mushroom risotto might be one of the best things I've ever eaten. The rice was cooked perfectly, and the earthy nutty flavour of the mushrooms was to die for."}
{"text":"Came to La Fenice while visiting Toronto, and was very pleased with the service, atmosphere, and food.  I ordered the shrimp (or prawns), and despite requesting that no butter was used, they came out amazing!! So delicious and juicy!! The service here was excellent as well. My boyfriend and I asked many question about the area and where to visit and closed out the place, and the entire time all employees were incredibly friendly, helpful, and on top of their game.  The bottle of wine we ordered was excellent as well, and the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant was nice, above average without feeling stuffy.   I highly recommend visiting La Fenice, and can say they are great with their seafood. ( My boyfriend ordered the lamb and while it was definitely good, did not blow him away like my shrimp!)"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! King St is an endless row of restaurants. There's so many choices, and as a newcomer, you're afraid to make the wrong decision. We lucked out here. The service was attentive, but not intrusive. The food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious. The restaurant provides bruschetta on the house in addition to the usual bread with olive oil and balsamic.   We ordered  the grilled shrimp and calamari for the appetizer. It was tender and well seasoned (including the radicchio salad underneath). For the meal, my husband ordered the quail risotto and I had the papardelle with veal ragu. These were delicious. Starches were al dente and meats were tender. For dessert we hand the brandy and vanilla crème brulee and the chocolate pecan torte. Both were light and delicious.  If you're still in doubt, be reassured that there are quite a few Italians dining here too."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Monday night.  Not crowded at all.  The service was outstanding.  The food was fresh -- even sliced tomato in February.  My main course of pasta and sea food was very tasty.  Great sauce.  Wine was excellent as well.  My dessert was the only disappointment. Dessert was supposed to be vanilla ice cream with raspberries but was a nearly tasteless ice cream with raspberry jam.  Slightly on the pricey side but well worth it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"La Fenice is probably my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto, as I think their pasta is one of the freshest! The decor is decidedly 1990s, but I love that about it :P I come here regularly and every time, the service has been friendly. They CAN be a bit slower than what we're used to at a place like Joey's or Mercatto, but I think they are aiming for us to take time to enjoy our food. Twice we came before a show and told them about it as we sat down. The wonderful waiters made sure to see us out the door right on time, as we asked! Very thoughtful and considerate service. My favourites are the White Zinfandel, Ceasar Salad, and Agnolotti (crescent-shaped pasta stuffed with ricotta & spinach in a rose sauce). SOOOO delicious and fresh, every time! The Tiramisu and Sicilian Bacio Tartufo are great desserts. I love this place and only wish I could eat here more often! You don't have to be super dressy (I've wandered in sometimes on a whim in almost \"touristy\" summer wear) and they are not snobby about dress code or anything, but it is also a place you can wear a dress shirt/suit/nice dress and you won't feel overdressed."}
{"text":"The food here is actually 3.5 star, but the service and ambiance made it 4 star.   We came here for a friend's birthday dinner. We had a party of 12 people, so it was quite a big group.   We shared a whole bunch of appetizers including the beef carppaccio, calamaretti and bruchetta. All of them were decent. The carpaccio is worth a try. I then had the Risotto Mare for main, which is a mixed seafood risotto. Flavor was ok, but there was sand in some of the mussels/clams and some of the rice was undercooked.   Although the food wasn't that impressive, our waitress did an excellent job. Water/wine glasses were always refilled promptly. She also exchanged a basket of bread that has been sitting on the table untouched for a while for a fresh batch without anyone asking."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience.  Service was bad overall and my boneless chicken entree tasted awful, in fact I thought it was tuna initially.  Once they replaced that meal with pasta I was fairly happy with the taste, but this is not a good restaurant and I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Treated my family to Italian food here for Winterlicious, really attentive service. Tried most of the entrees and combos between the four of us with the exception of the chicken and soup. The strip loin was a great opener, and was the highlight of the meal. I preferred the salmon to the steak in terms of texture and the garnish. The ice cream is definitely the best dessert, just the right amount of sweet and layered. The vegetarian items were not as filling, though the cheese was really good."}
{"text":"Overall, a great Winterlicious experience. I'd give the appetizer 3 stars (butternut squash and butter bean soup). I was expecting a puréed soup; also found it was a little luke warm. The entree (gnocchi with artichokes in a lemon cream sauce) was 4 star worthy - rich and delicious and creamy. The dessert (amaretto mocha tartufo) was also good, though I couldn't taste the mocha gelato. Service was fantastic. It was a great spot for lunch with co-workers as it wasn't noisy and we could all chat."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant just because it was getting late and from the outside looked nice. It was quite full but not packed and we were seated swiftly. Waiter took our request and then the wait began! Almost an hour to get our wine and then a long wait for dinner which for some was just bland and the rest only ok. We had to ask for more water each time we needed it and then he only would fill the person asking.  We looked around and felt the tables of two were served a bit quicker but tables of more, we had six, all had the long waits.  We were just visiting Toronto so it is not like it was local for us but if we return we would never return. The one star was because it was nice looking from the outside ."}
{"text":"Wow. What is service even. I have never asked so many times for some water or for someone to actually give me a menu. That and waiting an HOUR for food? AND THEN BRINGING ME SOMETHING I DID NOT ASK FOR AND WAS NO FOOD? Not okay.   Avoid this place. It's not worth the price or wait."}
{"text":"Dinner  Ambience: 4/5 Food: 3.75/5 Service: 4/5 (gracious and friendly) Value: 3.75/5 Repeat: maybe"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a special family history and with it, a focus on the highest quality food and service. They take pride in all of this and as a result, you will feel treated to a special and memorable meal. I recommend this restaurant for special occasions, especially for a romantic evening or a glamorous night on the town, perhaps accompanying a local show."}
{"text":"Very good italian food...in the theater district...specialty is fresh fish...flown in from the Meditteranean!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto on business this week, our team was pointed in the direction of La Fenice for a good Italian meal.  La Fenice's service was lovely.  We had a very earnest Italian waiter who hovered around topping up glasses and generally making sure we were all having a wonderful time.  One little hitch was they ran out of one appetiser and one dessert, which we had ordered.  And the wine recommendations were so - so.  However, my fish special (orata) was cooked to perfection.  And everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice spot to grab a good dinner before a TSO performance, and La Fenice was highly recommended by coworkers and friends.  The staff are incredibly friendly and always looking to help out. They took our jackets, put us at a perfect table, and gave us plenty of time to survey the wine list (and brought us some bubbly water while we decided).  I had the buffalo mozzarella Caprese salad, and the whole fish. Both were superb. The buffalo mozzarella cheese had a spectacular texture that far outdoes a standard Caprese. And the fish... It came to the table whole, and then was promptly deboned for me, but was returned still in one piece. If you like fish, this is for you. Hot, wonderfully flaky, and fun to eat, too. I tasted the veal ragu. I don't think I've ever had something so rich and filling in one single bite.  The whole time, our glasses were kept full and our every need (some of which we weren't even aware of) was taken care of, without the staff being intrusive or even necessarily noticed.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Went to La Fenice before heading out to see a play - great meal! We told them about the theatre arrangement when we made reservations so the staff knew we had to book in time to make the play, and everything worked fine. We started off with the soup of the day: a butter bean soup with rapini - delicious! We also had the bresaola - simple presentation that allowed me to enjoy the beef - very nice. We also had the grilled squid and shrimp - not overcooked, subtly flavoured so the seafood was the star, in a word - wonderful! For the mains, we had the spaghetti with shrimp, rapini and pancetta - wonderful combination of flavours though the pasta was a little too al dente, and the mushroom risotto served with grilled quails - a drier style risotto with very nice flavor and very nicely grilled quails. Service was excellent. Our waiter, Greg, knew his stuff and had a sense of humour as well that always helps. The ambience is nice - it's relatively quiet, restrained décor makes for pleasant dining and intimate conversation. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food and the location - we are talking theatre row here. Everything sounds so great, so why didn't they get 5 stars? Well, there were a bunch of small things that just took the edge off. The wine list was my first peeve - the first three choices I made were either not available or available in different vintages that those listed, one by as much as 4 years. If you are going to update your food menu occasionally, then take the time to update the wine menu as well, it's not that hard to do. The gluten free pasta wasn't cooked enough. It's very nice that they offer GF alternatives, but the kitchen should learn how to cook it properly. The risotto needed a touch more liquid - it might be a drier style, but it shouldn't be dry. Overall, dinner was good and it didn't break the bank, so I would go back."}
{"text":"Our final night in Toronto and we were a fatigued group.  By the time we coalesced for dinner, the team was more looking forward to crashing than eating. Trying to find something nearby that would meet our diverse food preferences, we decided to walk over to Earls, which was just a few blocks from the hotel.  Bad idea.  Immediately upon reaching the restaurant I sensed there was going to be a problem and sure enough, checking in with the hostess delivered the mind boggling news of a 2.5 hour wait.   Seriously? There's about a million (literally!) restaurants in Toronto. Why was everyone at Earls? More importantly, why were we?  So, out came the Yelp app and we quickly identified King Street within the Entertainment District as our next destination. This is a fabulous area in downtown Toronto that features one non-chain restaurant after another. During the warm weather every restaurant offers outside dining on the sidewalks and in some cases on the roof.  We wandered up and down the core blocks, comparing menus to Yelp reviews and ultimately settled on La Fenice. What a choice! Walking into the restaurant we immediately felt the March Toronto chill melt away. The restaurant is quaint, elegant and authentic. We were seated at a large round table at the front as our server unfolded our napkins and placed them in our laps.  Classy!  As we pursued the menu, the server introduced us to  the fresh fish options of the night by bringing out a platter chock full of raw fish (http://bit.ly/102QyJc). Hilariously, he chose to display the fish immediately in front of the person at the table who has a healthy aversion to seafood. We were all cracking up!  We ordered a bottle of Leonardo Chianti ($33.00) and some appetizers including Funghi di bosco al sapore d'erbe (Fresh wild mushrooms sautéed with fresh herbs http://bit.ly/102PHbs) ($13.00). They were delicious, especially if you love exotic mushrooms. The meal was paced perfectly and we were all relaxed and content by the time we placed our dinner order. I ordered the Costolette d'agnello ai ferri (Grilled rack of lamb with fresh mint wine sauce) ($33.00) as did two of my companions. Another co-worker ordered the Pappardelle con ragu di vitello e funghi porcini (Veal ragu with porcini mushrooms) ($22.00) and the final companion, the Nodino di vitello ai ferri (Grilled extra thick, double-cut veal chop seasoned with herbs)($34.00). (BTW, all prices in CAD.)   The lamb was perfectly prepared. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here's the before and after: http://bit.ly/102PB3x. I'd say that's a pretty good testament to a thoroughly enjoyed meal. Thank goodness I wasn't looking to impress any of my companions, because it would have been a damn shame to have not been able to pick up those lamb ribs and peel every last morsel off the bone.    We were all so stuffed that we decided to skip dessert.   On the way out we marveled at how we would still be waiting to be seated had we chosen to put our names in at Earls. Beyond that there's absolutely no way we would have had as tremendous of a meal. This was serendipity at its best!  The bill for the evening, including tip came to CAD $320, pretty darn close to what we spent a few nights earlier at The Keg (see my review: http://bit.ly/102PTaq). And, while we enjoyed that meal, it doesn't really come anywhere close to the meal we had at La Fenice. The take away, at least for me, is that no matter how formulaic and dependable restaurants like The Keg may be, seeking a more intimate experience is well worth the effort.   It's just an entirely different level our outstanding."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! It takes a lot for an Italian boy like myself to give an Italian resto 5 stars, but this one is well deserved.  The food was SUPERB! Everything was wonderfully flavourful, yet not overly salted. The sauce that the calamari appetizer was sitting in was to die for. We cleaned up the bowl with slices of bread. The buffalo morzarella appetizer that I got was equally amazing. The cheese melted in my mouth.  The mains were just as good. My friend got the beef short rib special, which came with risotto (yum!), while I got the mixed seafood plate. Again, everything was impeccable and delicious. For dessert we had the tiramisu, which was a bit on the fluffy side, but still amazing.  Service was good too. The staff are friendly and attentive. The place does get busy though, so make reservations. We saw groups of 2 coming in without reservations on a Thursday night and getting rejected because the place was booked solid.   The place has a very authentic feel. It's very much a \"mom-and-pop\" traditional Italian resto. Substance over style (which I much prefer). Great value as well. For that amazing meal (2 apps, 2 mains, 1 dessert, 4 drinks, and 1 espresso) it cost us $140 + tip. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Pappardelle very good.  Prosciutto and melon excellent as well. Desserts very good.  Reasonably priced. Solid service."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here (although the restaurant's location is more geared to the theatre district). Very good wine list. Had a green salad and risotto with Italian sausage, which was up to par. Menu was pretty conventional Italian, supplemented with a fresh fish selection."}
{"text":"La Fenice is one of Toronto's classic Italian restaurants.  The owners and staff are really first grade, as is the atmosphere.  If you get to know the place, you might ask about its history: it's quite interesting and indeed inspiring.  The wine is wonderful.  Their fish is always nice, as are their pastas.  Nothing better to cap it off than with a freshly brewed coffee and slice of tiramisu (one of the best in the city)."}
{"text":"OK, now, I LOVE La Fernice. But this review is solely based on my winterlicious experience today.  Service was amazing as always. I love the wait staff. Food is always cooked to perfection - especially the pastas. Al dente isn't a given at most Italian places. Also, their bread is to DIE for... 3 pieces later.  For Winterlicious, I started with the prosciutto and melon. It was great but uninspired. I think it would have really popped with a little drizzle of oil or balsamic. At least they did a few different types of melon.  I had the chicken over polenta. This was horrific. The polenta was hard as a rock. Chicken was tender but this bright orange sauce ruined it aesthetically and taste wise. It was like a bright tomato sauce. Disappointing.   Finally, so Italian ice cream. It was good. The Raspberry sorbet was better.  All in all, I should have ordered from the regular menu. *sad face*  Until next time, may your chef hat be straight and your kitchen clean!"}
{"text":"Food was average to good. Nothing great.   Service was terrible. Snooty. Stuck up.  Service was like doing us a favor.   Never going back again.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Really nice room, excellent service and superbly prepared food.  Likely the best Italian restaurant we have visited since Florence Italy.  A wonderful experience on our last evening in town.  Many thanks to the family and crew at La Fenice!"}
{"text":"Was in Toronto last week on business and we had a group dinner on our last night at La Fenice.  I thought it was very good!! The bartender made a PERFECT dirty martini, which was much needed after 4 long days of work! The service was spot on and the food good. Nice, convenient location on King Street, right across the street from the Hyatt Regency Toronto where we were staying.  If you're in Toronto and looking for good italian, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The street reminds me a lot of Italy, especially during high tourist season.  There always seems to be someone standing outside holding a menu, trying to get you to come in.  Sounds like a shady business practice.  La Fenice didn't have someone standing outside, but we still would've almost missed the place if we weren't paying attention.  The space isn't much to write home about, but it is cozy and probably really intimate if there were more people.  Even with an empty restaurant the staff had spacing issues.  This is your quintessential Italian restaurant, complete with friendly servers with heavy Italian accents.  We started with a little prosciutto and melon, and the gnocchi.  Melons other than cantaloupe seemed strange, but I guess anything sweet and juicy to complement the salty would work.  The sauce on the gnocchi was a little sweet, but still good and even better with the cheese.  They really do the pasta justice, which seemed fresh, by cooking it al dente in my case.  Pappardelle with duck confit ragu was cooked well; the duck not overcooked and just enough tomato sauce.  Thankfully this sauce wasn't as sweet as the antipasto, but that may have just been the game-y flavor of the duck confit balancing the sweetness out.  Nevertheless, I'm a sucker for pappardelle, so this was a hit.  Wine was served a touch warm, probably due to how it was stored, but a drop in a bucket for a few moments solved that problem.  I probably enjoyed the dessert portion of the meal the most.  A little wine, a little limoncello, a few whiffs of some grappa, a little grappa, and then my favored affogato, and I was all set.  We had our own little smelling session of their grappas, and that helped us pick out some really good stuff.  4 stars for some seriously solid Italian fare, made better by the desserts, after dinner digestifs, and homely service.  Don't be scared of this somewhat touristy street."}
{"text":"I visited La Fenice a few weeks back for their Summerlicious promotion, we were a group of 4 people As we walked through the door we were greeted in a friendly manner. The restaurant is very dimly lit but it looks like it needs a bit of updating. Perhaps the intention it to keep it looking a bit oldschool, but for the area it is in, they should do a bit of modern updating.  We ordered a white zinfandel for the table and were brought some bread as well which was great. The restaurant was not packed yet not empty which provided the perfect balance.  Appetizer: I ordered the fried mozzarella and it was quite good. The portion was on the small side, however it was just the app. My friends ordered the mussels and the smoked salmon, and they were happy with their apps Main: All of us with the exception of one person ordered the white veal meatballs with tomato sauce and risotto. We were all more than pleased with this dish. The risotto was cooked to perfection as were the meatballs. They were juicy and very well seasoned. The sauce was perfect with the right amount of acidity. Our one friend ordered Gnocci off the regular menu and was slightly underwhelmed with it. I did not try it myself but it did look rather plain Dessert: I had the hazelnut tartufo for dessert and I ate every last bit of it. Im not sure if it was made in house or ordered but it exceeded my expectations.  I will say however, the entire experience took about 2.5 hours. The service seemed intentionally on the slow side as it seems they want you to experience the meal rather than dine and leave. We were in no big rush (just super hungry) so it didn't pose much of a problem for us, however  keep this in mind if you have set plans for after dinner."}
{"text":"It's strange.  I knew about (almost) every other restaurant in this area, except for this one.  It was my best friend's bachelorette, so I was attempting to find a restaurant that can hold more than 10 people, and NOT be à la carte.  I called almost every restaurant that I could find, and somehow landed on this one.  I called this one, and they were super duper nice and said that they could accommodate my party AND it would be à la carte!  Win!  We ended up here at 8:15 pm on a Saturday night with 13 hungry girls.  It was excellent service!  There wasn't that many people at the restaurant -- probably one table inside, and everybody else was outside.  We had our table ready for us, and the waiters/waitresses were excellent.  Bread was excellent, and they also provided us with bruschetta (on the house).  I, myself, had the gnocchi - which I was quite happy with.  Everybody else seemed happy with their meal as well, and it wasn't too pricy.  The cutest thing was that they kept offering to help us take pictures for the evening.  Absolutely wonderful service.  No complaints, and they weren't complaining about us being there either.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Timeles.Low key older somewhat heeled crowd.Excellent perfectly cooked  pastas with clean flavours.Not inexpensive.

Highly Professional and experienced staff.  A family establishment.(Nice steady work Rocco!)Imiss the days of white truffles on fettecine; Still ;;Toronto's finest Northern Italian??"}
{"text":"This is a belated review for Winterlicious. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised here because it didn't seem like a popular Winterlicious spot but we all really enjoyed our meals! Service was good, portions were good, and the food itself was very tasty. I would come back. Please note the crowd seemed a bit of an older group, but it may be due to the proximity to the theatres and what show was on that night, who knows. Definitely not a youthful or hip hangout I'd say."}
{"text":"This review is for their Winterlicious 2016 menu. I would rate the food at 3 stars and 5 stars for the service, which was excellent! :) The host, waiters, and waitresses were polite, and funny is always a bonus. Our waitress came over periodically to check that we had everything we needed. I know this comes across as annoying for some people so maybe this isn't a pro in that case. We also got complimentary bruschetta and it was very good. I love how it was made with toasted bread and not the super hard and crumbly toast-biscuits so when you bit it, it doesn't all just fall apart and then you need to use a fork to eat the rest.  Let's move on to the food now! The appetizer was actually my favorite out of the 3-course meal. I ordered the mussels and clams and it was sooooo good. My friends ordered the prosciutto and eggplant. I didn't try the prosciutto but they said it was good and I tried a bit of the eggplant, was pretty good (healthy option as well). The broth with the mussels and clams were super yummy, it's a good thing they gave me a spoon for it. They also provide a small plate on the side for the shells.   As for the main course, I ordered the white veal meatballs. It's probably the most filling main course on the Winterlicious menu. Came with a good portion of creamy risotto and 3 large veal meatballs. I'm not sure if it's because it's Milanese risotto, but the rice was a little firmer than what I was expecting. I must say the texture was like regular steamed rice. The meatballs were good but I thought  it would be more tender since it's veal (almost feel barbaric saying that lol).   Unfortunately, my choice of dessert was the most disappointing. I got the homemade biscotti and sweets. The sweets portion is an assortment of cookies/biscuits. The biscotti itself wasn't bad and the seashell-shaped dessert (bottom left) in my picture was something like a spongy cake so that wasn't bad either but the other cookies didn't really spark Amy ooohs or ahhhhs out of me. I think the raspberry sorbet looked the most delicious but my friends who ordered it said it was a bit too sour. The mousse sounded the best but my friends only said it was alright."}
{"text":"Came here for a special birthday dinner with seven of our friends. The rating is for the service NOT the food. The food is a solid 4 stars.   Unfortunately we got an asshole waiter who was nothing short of snarky comments and attitude. Here's one of many examples. When I initially booked our reservation I asked the reservationist if they did anything special for birthdays. He said yes. Okay so when the waiter came by initially he obviously didn't have any idea we were there for a birthday. I have worked in the restaurant business years ago and typically if there is a group you ATLEAST smile and acknowledge \"oh I see we are celebrating a birthday...etc) So I quietly asked him \"we are celebrating a birthday do you do anything special\" I was meaning like 'hey do you bring a candle or even acknowledge it' his reply to me was \"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FREE NO WE DONT DO THAT BUT IF YOU WANT A DESSERT THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR WE CAN PUT A CANDLE IN THAT\". I pretty much stopped asking anymore questions after that answer. I wasn't implying anything free you asshole.  He obviously needs a new job that doesn't cater to people in general. So the last straw was when we ordered the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and got lectured that he didn't want to bring out extra dishes because it was a bother and all this extra BS that is totally irrelevant to guests...that's when the table realized we LOVE being scolded. LOL. He made the dining pretty unpleasant. The food is great tho. If you can bypass the monkey.  Perhaps if he was nice to us like he should have been we would have kept ordering bottles of wine! We already had started with 3 bottles....but never reordered because we didn't want to keep donating money to someone who was such an ass to our group. Oh and he never introduced himself at all but he had a leprechaun looking beard and a reddish brown hair and his eyes should just be rolled into the back of his head since that's what we saw the whole night anyway. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Review ****  This was my one and only Winterlicious booking in 2015, and the only reason for it is that my friends were meeting up as a group for dinner already, so we thought we'd try a Winterlicious menu. I'm always hesitant with Winter/Summerlicous because I know the service can be severely misrepresented...but I thought I'd give it a shot.  Con: The table. The actual table. The entire side on my end was that flap of the table, and it led to a knife and spoon to slide off, and us unable to put any sort of weight on the side. Kinda odd.  Con: We were a group of 7 (diners, not artists). My bf couldn't make the 6:30 reservation because work got busy, so I asked the server to remove one of the place settings, since we were 1 person down. But when everyone else arrived, I realized one of us had called ahead already to make the change in numbers, so asked for it back, and was met with some attitude.   Con:  We weren't given a wine menu, so we had to specifically ask for it. The server also said \"I assume it's wine by the glass?\" well, no....We're ordering by the bottle, but thanks for that assumption! We had to pick the wine 3 times, because the first two were unavailable. Tsk tsk.  Con:  When ordering, everyone thought the first dessert listed was the best sounding one, but the server informed us that it was already sold out. It was 7pm only, at that point. I thought that was pretty poor preparation on their part. To their credit, they did come back with a substitute option, but it was a far cry from what was on the menu.   Pro/Pro/Con: I ordered the BRESAOLA, which was Smoked Cured Beef with Arugula & Grana-Padano Cheese for starter - nice presentation, good flavours. For entree, I had Papperadelle Con Anatra, Wide Egg Noodles with Duck Confit. Another delicious dish! Presentation was just ok, but definitely well done. Dessert was the biscotti, which was the poorest presentation of dessert I've ever seen. Literally 3 biscotti sitting on a plate. ALSO, my friends who ordered the striploin were not given an option for doneness - medium well for all!  To their credit, the service improved throughout the meal - perhaps our server got a bit of a talking to? She was a lot more pleasant and helpful later on, and was perfectly nice while helping our group take a picture.   Overall - the service in the beginning left a bit of a sour note. It's the Winterlicious service, I'm telling ya! The food itself was actually a 3.5/4 rating, except for the dessert. I really don't think the service is representative of the normal dinner service, but unfortunately, that's the experience I had."}
{"text":"Met a friend here after work one night and he recommended this place. We came at around 6 so it wasn't too busy. The restaurant was small and quiet - it definitely felt a little older and outdated for my taste. Our server was great, he was very attentive and knowledgeable about all of the seafood and wine they had and was able to make great recommendations.   I had the Grigliato Misto Di Mare - Grilled shrimp, calamari, scallops and salmon. It was pretty good, the seafood was fresh and the portions were pretty large, I couldn't finish it so my friend had to help. He had a seafood pasta dish that was also pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of pasta but I thought it was pretty authentic and fresh. For dessert we had this dessert that was different types of ice cream in a ball, I forgot the name but it was really good and I would definitely get it again.   The food was pretty good but the atmosphere wasn't for me. I was hoping to go somewhere more fun and high energy. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a tasteful relaxed dinner in a casual but classy place."}
{"text":"When I first walked into this restaurant for my girlfriend's birthday party, I was really impressed. The service was courteous as we were welcomed with coat check and shown to our tables.  First impression: nice ambience. Looks like a great place for a date. Sometimes awkwardly quiet (they have no background music), but I was impressed.  The food itself was actually quite good. I had the seafood mare risotto. Absolutely amazing. I'm normally not a fan of seafood other than sushi, but I have to say, the food was excellent.  So why two stars?  Well like many of the reviews I saw here, I too experienced bad service from the actual waiter assisting our table. I understand that we were a big group (about 16 people) and they can be stressful, but the server we had was absolutely horrendous.  We were for the most part on time (our group was complete by 8:15PM for a 8PM reservation), yet our server was rushing us to order food when most of us wanted to just start with appetizers and drinks.   That's fine, maybe it just closes early. But no it gets worse.  Our waiter had a tendency to just reach over you without asking. There were a couple of times he literally grinded my body with his sweaty body. Really not pleasant.   It gets even worse.  He was basically tossing the bruschetta onto our plates. Half the tomatoes spilled onto my dress pants. He spilled salad dressing on the girl beside me and did not seem the least be apologetic. Never once said excuse me or checked up to see how our meals were.   I try not to be a bad customer because I used to be a bus boy in high school, but man this guy was bad. So bad that I don't feel guilty for only tipping him 10% and that I still feel the need to call in and complain about him."}
{"text":"Toronto so happily overfoams with trendy rustic-style Italian restaurants that I am almost surprised when one--in this case, La Fenice--sports a more traditional ambience.  A pair of pals and I headed here for their Summerlicious menu.  The food is as great or better than what you might expect from Terroni or any of its reasonable facsimiles.  I had a fresh garden salad with bocconcini, duck papparadelle, and raspberry sorbetto.  The papparadelle was delicious, and the duck was perfectly cooked, swimming in a light but hearty sauce.  The sorbetto had such a potent flavour, it was like something you'd serve to an alien if you wanted to be sure they knew exactly what the heck raspberries taste like.    The service was maybe a little too attentive at times--the waiter was becoming interrogative about a piece of steak left uneaten on one of my pal's plates--but nothing to complain about.  You leave feeling that a lot of care goes into the food and service."}
