{"text":"The food is fantastic and they have great daily specials through out the week. We went on a Friday for a nice holiday happy hour only to be informed that apparently friday is not part of the weekday, therefore there is no happy hour. I have never heard of a single restaurant not having a happy hour on a Friday and not considering friday a weekday, it was severely dissappinting. I would love for my company to recognize friday as a weekend too!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give this place a try. I'll get straight to the point....the food is incredible. I had the specialty Manhattan to drink (amazing) and the short rib with whipped hominy for dinner. That dish was absolute perfection. Our server (Dan?) couldn't have been better. 
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Brunch menu.. great potions and nice atmosphere.    Many vegan and vegetarian dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"Second time here w/girlfriend and we have had good and bad both times. First visit her short rib was awesome, well seasoned and tender. Drinks were good and oysters were great. My osso bucco was cold in the middle, like ice. Server gave an education that it wasn't raw just not warm which I knew. Sent it back for refire and it was ok I guess. This time got oysters again.....on point! Chicken wings, not a drop of seasoning and definitely not confit. $12 for 7 wings is a bit too NYC for me when they get beat by my corner joint at $.40 a pop. Drinks were good, Bahn Mi was the jam. Kettle chips on side were crumbs out of a name brand bag. Not worth the $100 bill but that was our bad for drinking more than the food."}
{"text":"Jerry was amazing.  The food was great.  As the appetizer we had mussels and for lunch it was trout , both fresh and cooked to perfection.  We're planning to have future dinner gatherings here"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience on new year's eve with multiple mishaps on the part of the restaurant. We were a group of 20 looking to reserve a place on NYE. We called forage to check on two things: 

1. if they could make arrangements for a group of 20 
2. If they were going to do a special NYE menu like many other places. This was important because we had been to Forage multiple times in the past and were looking to try something that we hadn't.

We were told they had a special seating area and a single table that would sit our group of 20. We were also told that they would have a special NYE menu. So we made the reservation.

We were told we would have the table from 9pm-12am. When we arrived that night, our table wasn't ready. Apparently the party before ours had not finished. Not a big deal and the restaurant assured us it would be ready shortly. They seated a few of us at a small table to wait. An hour passed and our table was still not ready. By this time most of us had arrived and had to be scattered around while we waited. We were still assured the table would be ready and in the meantime they asked if we would like to order drinks. We did, more time passed, and our table was still not ready. It became very apparent that our table would not be ready and that there were no plans to move us. What was also apparent was that management wasn't really concerned that they had screwed up. Instead they offered us a few pieces of \"bread and cheese on the house\". At this point, with our group scattered, we decided to go ahead and order food to somehow salvage the night. This is when the horrific nature of the restaurant blossomed into a complete sh!t show of mismanagement. The waitress brought over the their regular every day menus. I asked if we could have the NYE menu... There was a suspenseful silence until the waitress said \"There are no NYE menus\"....

Forage 0-2
Us 0-1

That adds up to three outs.

Also, do I even mention that my wife's Salmon was rare in the middle? Yes, yes I do. Because on top of bad management, they can't cook to how the customer would like their food. Why bother asking how someone wants their fish cooked if you're just going to do what the \"chef recommends\"?

My takeaway from this is that Forage views its customers as simpleton idiot Clevelanders who do not care if the restaurant does not follow through on its promises and any problems that arise can be put to bed with some free appetizers like they do at Chi Chi's or the like. That's the feeling they gave me. In years past we have done our NYE dinners at higher end places in Ohio City and Tremont and have never been disappointed with the food or service. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. The food is fantastic, the drinks are amazing and nicely potent, and they always seem to have a bomb playlist on rotation for your listening pleasure. I love the fact that many of the ingredients are locally sourced and perhaps even foraged (hence the name) from our own local lands. They have more vegetarian and vegan options than many of the other restaurants... The vegan \"chicken\" and waffles are an absolutely fave whether you are a meat eater or not. Some of the best vegan Mac n cheese I've had as well. Try the blood Orange Sangria."}
{"text":"Bring back the old menu. Miss the pulled pork sandwich. Food is still good, but miss at least 3 of the old menu items"}
{"text":"I have been to Forage twice for dinner and numerous times for lunch and have never been disappointed.  The food has been delicious, interesting and beautifully presented every time and the atmosphere just keeps getting better and better! Tonight, a singer with acoustic guitar provided the perfect backdrop and he was positioned in a spot that did not overwhelm conversation.  This evening the calamari was a good as any we have had anywhere-exquisitely tender with a light batter coating. LOVE the vegan options-tonight the Israel Couscous salad was simply fantastic. My companion had the short ribs on hominy - perfection. Service was prompt and very pleasant. A five-star way to start the weekend!"}
{"text":"So about a month ago, I gave this restaurant 5 stars. Today unfortunately I cannot do this. Frankly the issue with this restaurant is its lack of consistency in delivering the same flavor and quality in the same dish. 
Overall we have visited this place about 8 times since they have opened. And we have been on a roller coaster of quality and flavor each time we come in. 
Today my husband ordered their special vegetarian curry. Dish looked pretty but had no flavor, no sauce. Yes, you could not taste curry! My dish was also nothing special, not for the price we have paid for it (chunk of meat on a bone, mushed potatoes with a few leaves of arugula without much flavor). But the biggest disappointment was desert, key lime pie. It costs $9, yes $9. Last time we had it, we  totally understood  the price. Pie was absolutely heavenly. ( you probably can find some other reviews praising this dish). Today's dish was awful. Crust ( that is the key to this restaurants incredible pie) was a pile of sandy like mush at the bottom of a bit of filling. And I was charged $9 for it. Unfortunately I took it home as a carry out so I was not able to return it to the kitchen. 
Not sure if I can support the ups and downs of this establishment. Not sure if I will be coming back. We have too many great places here in Lakewood, that if you cannot deliver consistent experience, you will loose your customers."}
{"text":"i met my sister hear around 5:00 for dinner. It's a huge place with lots of big windows for people watching. There were only two other tables and lots of employees milling around talking and making jokes. Our server was waiting on the only other two tables, she came to our table, we ordered wine, then we didn't see her again for ten minutes.  I saw her taking care of the other table that was about to leave and tried to get her attention but it didn't work.  I was getting frustrated and was about to walk out by the fact that there were so many other employees there but not helping customers. They were chatting or busying themselves with side work.  I like to come to a place where I feel like the main objective of every one there is to serve me.  Is that asking too much?  

Food was pretty good. The little portion of olive and pepper mixture was very yummy with the bread. The poutine was good, but could have used a little more gravy and the mushroom pasta was waaaaaaaay too salty, and I usually always put salt on my food. I'd probably go back begrudgingly if my sister wanted to go again, because there were other things I wanted to try on the menu, but I probably wouldn't recommend Forage to anyone because of the service."}
{"text":"Met friends here for dinner tonight and was disappointed to say the least. The prices were unbelievably high for what was served. My husband ordered a beet salad that was $13 and it was several slices of beets, a tiny bit of cheese, barely a drizzle of dressing and a few nuts. He also got the chicken wings which were fine, but nothing spectacular. I had the cous cous salad with roasted veggies and a side of poutine. Poutine is pretty straight forward. Fries. Good gravy. Cheese curds. This poutine was mostly fries with not nearly enough gravy and the cheese curds were cold! The veggies on the salad were terribly over roasted and lacked salt and the vinegarette was more of a sweet sauce. Nothing made sense. My tip to Forage...loose all the wordy farm to table jargon on your menu. Simplify the menu and do fewer items better. Wish we would have gone to Stino da Napoli or Spice for what we paid."}
{"text":"Uhm... Yum yum yum!

The food here is DELICIOUS, the portions are pretty damn generous, and everything is locally organic or something like that (with Forage being one of two restaurants in the area to do so).

I have absolutely no complaints about Forage and it's now easily one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu.

We'll start with apps: Devils On Horseback and Stuffed Pasture Raised Eggs. The Devils Horseback consists of chorizo and dates wrapped in bacon. It is the perfect combination of sweet, spice, and everything nice. The Eggs are simply deviled eggs. Our waitress said they were blended with goat cheese, which made them extra creamy. Delish, delish!

Entrees: Rabbit Loin and Osso Buco. I seriously love me some meat and neither of these dishes disappointed. The rabbit is served on a large bed of barley, farro, and huckleberries. The huckleberries are so tiny and adorable, but add just the right amount of sweetness! Osso Buco is a pork shank that literally falls off the bone. Super tender. Served with a scoop of mashed potatoes, a drizzle of gravy, and a pile of arugula. It doesn't get any more meat and potatoes than this. These dishes are pretty large and kind of a bargain. Their fish dishes sounded excellent. Next time I'm there I'll definitely be getting one of those. 

If you're a foodie you'll love this joint!"}
{"text":"Went here for my 30th birthday with a group of eight. Worst service I've had in years. 35 minutes for a beer. I tried giving a stack of menus back to eh server three times and he never took them. Eventually put them on the floor. He came over at one point and stepped on them but still didnt take them. Another server brought out half the food and then took 15 minutes to bring out the rest. Food was so-so. Decor incredibly blah. Boooooo."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!!!!!!! Most go! Fresh Farm to Table, Great Service. Appetizer: the beets -incredible,  the sausage - homemade, incredible flavor.  Dinner: the rainbow trout - fresh and perfectly  prepared."}
{"text":"As I post this review I'm sitting at The Rush Inn...why? you ask. 
My wife and I were seated at Forage, outside, givin menus and sat unattended for 25 minutes, left alone to look at the 6 other people visiting on a Wednesday afternoon around 5:30. After being passed by the waiter a second time, we decided to head down to the tried and true Rush Inn....one of the best places in Lakewood! As for Forage...I couldn't tell you."}
{"text":"The vegan mac and cheese at Forage is enough to give this place five stars all on its own. Hands down the best flavor, texture, smell, and overall combo of ingredients in a mac and cheese I've ever had. Locally foraged ingredients make my heart swoon."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good service and a large drink list makes this a must visit place in Lakewood.

Do yourself a favor and get the vegan Mac  'n Cheese."}
{"text":"This place used to be my absolute favorite brunch spot. I would crave the waffle that came with their vegan \"chicken\" (read: mushrooms) and waffle, because it was truly the best waffle I'd ever had. I hadn't been here in a few months, but was very excited to go again this morning. Much to my dismay, they've completely changed the waffle. The once light, fluffy, crisp, Belgian style waffle of my desire has been replaced by a small, dense, flaccid imposter. The crisp sweetness was replaced by soggy and flavorless bread, and an onslaught of the fried mushrooms - far too many to attempt to enjoy with the imposter waffle. 

Will I come back to Forage? Probably. Will I ever get the vegan chicken and waffle again? Probably not. Truly a heartbreaking development."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough of Forage. The Chef and staff does amazing work!!! The food always blows my mind and is reasonably priced! We've even brought our one and a half year old son here and he loves the food too!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and 2 of us had vegan meals. My cousin liked his chicken sandwich.  Sadly the noise level required shouting at each other.   It was also too dark to read the menu easilyWhile I will eat here again, I will not come on a Saturday night. The other time I came was on a Monday. It was much quieter. And please get better cheese than Tillamook. We are from Oregon and it is factory cheese."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Forage and I am nothing but impressed. I moved away from Ohio a few years ago but this place is definitely on my top ten for west side restaurants. The calamari is phenomenal as well as the Mac n cheese and wings. For main courses, the fish tacos are a hit. I will continue to return when I come back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The food is great - local ingredients, constantly changing menu, and good service. I haven't had anything here that I dislike."}
{"text":"I was impressed by reviews and looking forward to checking this place out while in town for work but when I went in, I found out that they're currently offering a very limited \"brunch\" menu between 11am-3pm on the weekend. The bartender did say she'd be willing to see if they'd be able to prepare what I actually wanted from the regular menu, but it would probably take longer. I just didn't want to spend my day waiting around for lunch when there were lots of other decent options in the area and I was already starving. Bummer."}
{"text":"Talk about a MAJOR hidden gem!!! Went here last night and hands down one of my new favorite spots! Great atmosphere with an extensive menu selection. We probably took 20 minutes just staring at the menu because you'll want one of everything.

Started out with the Devils on Horseback, holy hell, so delish! And don't even get me started on the Pommes Frites with truffle oil. I would've been content with those two things alone. I had their burger and added Gouda, as well as the Maple Syrup Cured Pork Belly. Best burger I've ever had that's packed punch full of flavor! My friend had the Beef Shortrib and raved about it, I took a bite and it just melted in your mouth. Our server was awesome, very friendly and let's just say we weren't disappointed with her recommendations!

Can't wait to bring more friends here soon and more often!"}
{"text":"The server seemed to forget that we had been sat. The food--I did a pick 2 for $9-- was less than mediocre. The pickles were oddly flavored, the sandwich was mostly flavorless bread, and the salad had an acidic dressing that was just gross. Maybe if I had had a beer then I would have thought it tasted okay."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food!
I was in for brunch with my vegetarian and vegan friends from out of town. 
We were very impressed with their menu!
Service was a little iffy.. we asked the young waitress for mimosas or belinis and she had no clue what they were (its brunch time and you don't know what a mimosa is??)
But I'll definitely go back to try their dinner menu.
We order:
Pretzels
Garlic French fries
Shrimp & grits 
Vegan omelette 
Eggs & potatoes 
Mimosas :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and I have never been disappointed. Not only is the service top notch but the food is the best. I can tell the ingredients are all fresh and the cooking is complex and expert. This place is a gem in the Cleveland eating scene. Even something as simple as a pretzel is elevated to the sublime."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday here is the best lunch spot. $2 per taco and $3 for the special makes for a great deal, as 2-3 tacos are filling! Less than $10 for a lunch is hard to find so this is a great little treat.

Make sure you have a little extra time because even though the food comes out relatively quick, the waitresses are slow to return or bring boxes so I usually let them know in advance when I am done with my order.

However, the other items tend to run $10-17 each and are equally small (see: standard) portions so it is an expensive place if you aren't purchasing a special."}
{"text":"I just got back from the opening of Forage, it was a great dining experience with the staff really doing well. I started with a craft beer and cheese board, the pairings with the cheese were very well thought out.  My main course I had the suckling pig which was cooked to tender perfection.  They said that the menu is seasonal and they try to bring in as much local and organic food as they can.  It was well worth going in and I plan on returning to see what new things the kitchen will put out."}
{"text":"I moved here from the NY City area and I have been to quite a few gastro pubs and this one is a great example of one.  My husband and I are here fairly often.  The service is always great and the food is consistent.  I think that the food is really accessible while still appealing to foodies.  The cocktails are fantastic and the usual bartender is attentive and knowledgeable. Everything I have had has been great - burgers, perch tacos, wings, nicose salad - nothing has disappointed."}
{"text":"The menu is great and the food was well prepared.  The bartender was very attentive and personal without being annoying and it's a much more relaxing atmosphere than the old pacers that used to be in the space."}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks. Awesome atmosphere. If you ask for something, you'll get it. Especially gravy. I'll be back, great experience!"}
{"text":"Forage is one of my new west side favorites. I've only been twice but it has been phenomenal both times. 

The first time I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. I do my own pulled pork from time to time and during my stint in California my recipe was called \"enlightening\". Now, that gentleman may have been in altered state of mind at the time, but I still like to think I know a thing or two about the subject. Let me tell you... The meat was done perfect, the texture was on point, just the right amount of sauce, all the trappings were great too. It made me feel like a fledgling artist seeing a Monet in person for the first time. \"This is how the masters do it.\" I thought.

My most recent visit was to celebrate my parent's 39th anniversary. Good drinks, good appetizers, and the mushroom fettuccine was glorious. I wasn't enlightened by it though, I was en-heavied. I swear I put on a good five pounds from that meal alone. Totally worth it!

Devils on Horseback- Do yourself a favor and try these. Pork fat rules. Always.
Fried Cheese Curds- You'll never enjoy mozzarella sticks or any other fried cheese product as much after trying these. You've been warned. 
Some kinda s'more dessert- It's elegant but still tastes just like a s'more without the benefit of dangerously waving around a flaming marshmallow at your closet friends. I wasn't as impressed as I was with everything else, but I'm not going to knock something for simply tasting like its namesake. Would probably try a different dessert next time. Now, if they served a deconstructed s'more on plate with a little cup with a lump or two of hot charcoal in the center and some fondue forks so I could set some 'mallows on fire I'd argue they need a sixth star straight away.  

Most importantly, the rest of the party including the parents loved it too! Shout out the the awesome service from Ryann (I may have butched the spelling there). The whole experience was fantastic. 

Now if only they had brisket..."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday not certain how my \"meat and potatoes\" guy would enjoy it. He loved it! His chicken was fantastic and the sausage even more so. I loved the mussels. Everything was perfection. The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff wonderful. I can't wait to go back! If you are looking for a truly memorable evening, you'll find it at Forage."}
{"text":"We recently stopped by Forage to try it out, and we were not disappointed. It also helped that we happened to be there during happy hour. They had great specials --- including $3 craft beers and $6 burgers (plus toppings).

Overall the feeling and decor was very warm and inviting. And, it looks like they'll have a great patio once the weather warms up!

The menu is full of locally sourced food, which is excellent. We both had burgers, with pork belly and various cheeses, and we added the pommes frites. Everything was delicious and very flavorful. Great execution, and we'll definitely be stopping back!"}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding. My husband got the sausage board and the best blt, I got the calamari and the Osso Buco, all were outstanding. We had to bring some home, we got so full. We sat outside and it was a nice Saturday afternoon, after all the rain we got. This place is fantastic, so nice to have a great restaurant like this in our great city. If you haven't tried it yet, you need to quick."}
{"text":"Now one my favorite burger joints in Cleveland. Found this place on a top ten burger places in Cleveland and it deserves it. The burgers are all fresh with locally grown ingredients. I ordered goat cheese and mushrooms on mine and it was great. The fries were tasty as well. Looking at other dishes around me, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was heartbreaking the day I found out that Pacers closed and that Forage Public House was coming in its place! It took a very long time to get me to walk into this place. Upon arrival it felt like I was still walking into Pacers as the layout was still the same but the color scheme has changed and the environment was more of a fancy place to dine than that of a place to drink beers, shoot some pool, play some Keno, and certainly eat some yummy greasy food that you will be sure to regret the next day! But nonetheless I came and I was starving and was longing for an inexpensive healthy lunch. I ordered the Lakewood Salad and the BLT from the pick two option on their lunch menu which was $9 bucks; not so bad! The salad was fresh and full of fruit and super smooth and creamy chevre with a delicious side of their homemade vinaigrette. The BLT was loaded with pork belly and an herb infused mayo on two slices of hearty delicious bread. I have to say it really hit the spot! I look forward to coming for dinner and drinks soon! The absence of Pacers continues to linger; however, I am so glad I broke the ice, reduced my stubbornness and gave this wonderful place a try. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service..long overdue review. Dog friendly, vegan and carnivore friendly. Dog friendly was important as we took our pup here for his \"last day\". They were so kind and loving and made him a few special dishes. Dog lovers for sure and truly \"got\" the day. 
Our whole family loves this spot some of us plant based but lots of choices for everyone..
Chris and the staff are awesome hosts)
Thanks for making a sad day a little brighter)"}
{"text":"My daughter, grandson, and I had dinner here. The food,drinks and service were awesome. My grandson had a burger with Swiss and pork belly, said it was best burger ever. We shared oysters they were very fresh. My daughter and I had the Kobe beef ribs with pea tendrils and homing...loved it. Many vegan selections ..they even have a vegan night."}
{"text":"Forage used to be one of my favorite places in Northeast Ohio, but it's gone really downhill in the last few months. The past two times I've been there, they are \"out of stock\" on many of their menu items. The service was really slow and inattentive. I tried to place a to-go order recently, and the young lady answering the phone spoke broken English and couldn't understand my order. I tried speaking slowly and clearly but she put me on hold and then hung up on me! I won't be going there again... lots of other good options in the area."}
{"text":"Surprising little gem that is big on local sourcing! We ordered each of the tacos on lettuce.  The fresh cut fries were great.  We added the fresh garlic and herbs with aoli.  I chose the Lakewood Citizen salad and added the Amish chicken.  Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area during lunch stop in and order the Amish tacos. They are quite tasty and the service here is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC !!!
The server was phenomenal... Tracy.
The menu is awesome and has several selections for everyone, including vegan.
Desert was great.
And most important - great coffee.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR !
We will absolutely be back... often."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, most recently sitting inside and enjoying a hamburger and beer. I definitely recommend sitting outside if it is nice .. they have a great patio and atmosphere. The service is great, and the food is delicious. Overall, it's a great place, it just doesn't pop out in my mind as a favorite place to go to, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. Also, last time we went, they put us in the very last booth in the corner, which was A. hard to navigate to between the tables and B. very cramped and dark. I will definitely request not be sitting there next time I go. They have a great burger, which you can customize, and the fries are done perfectly."}
{"text":"Came for an impromptu dinner on a Friday night with friends.  The fries were good, but the fish tacos were just meh.  There were other things on the menu that looked interesting, but it's hard to get over the prices.  This is your place if you prioritize local sourcing over price, but I'm more of a \"meet in the middle\" kind of gal.

As far as atmosphere goes, I just remember it being unnecessarily and uncomfortably dark in our corner booth.  And I thought it was a little odd that the restroom was a long walk down the hall and around the corner (completely outside of the restaurant, but in the same building), but only had 2 stalls.  You'd think if it's a common restroom with other businesses in the building it would be bigger, or that if it's just for the restaurant it would be closer."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 for lunch. We were all pleasantly surprised at our orders. Soups were yummy, sandwiches on locally sourced breads were delicious, the waitstaff was friendly, helpful and attentive, but not overly in your face. The chef came over to chat, which is something we all liked. We were able to chat without the music being too loud. All in all, a positive experience. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"A solid four. Went for lunch, and the atmosphere was okay, but it would probably be a lot more awesome at night. The food was great. I just had a burger, but it was one of the best in the area I've had. Service was really nice. Didn't try the fries, but they smelled heavenly. 

For now, bathrooms are outside of the restaurant in the lobby of the building it's housed in. Minor detail (and oddly, I kind of always like that setup. It's a little more interesting that way)."}
{"text":"Not Impressed!
We tried this relatively new restaurant after reading such great reviews and found that it was a big let down. We came in on a Saturday night only to find barely 1/3 of the restaurant filled. We started the evening by ordering some drinks. I got a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and my hubby got the B. Nektar Zombie Killer. His beer was good although for $5 it was half the size of a draft beer that you would get anywhere else. My drink was a different story. I enjoyed the stuffed olives but the rest of the drink which was stiff, tasted strange. I never tasted a dirty martini like that. I can't even pin point the taste. Strong but not enjoyable. So I slowly just sipped on it not to let it go to waste, which cost $9. 
Moving on...we wanted to try their wings as we LOVE wings and rarely find fabulous ones around other then the one's we get at McCrann's in Elyria. To our surprise the Soy Chili Wings were good. Very moist and tender. Good but not spectacular great. This is where all the great points of our dinner stop with the exception of our service. Our waitress was great. No complaints here. Kuddos to her! I convinced my hubby to try the New Creation Farm Short Rib for $24 as so many people raved about it. Yes, it was tender as others mentioned but the sauce lacked in depth and flavor. He did like the micro greens. But that should not be the highlight of the dish. Sorry! I took a bite to taste and found it very fatty, again w/o much flavor. I ordered the Daugherty Roasted Foraged Mushrooms for $18 and while I really like mushrooms I did not like this dish. Besides the mushrooms, I have to say that I did not taste anything but A LOT of butter and the many sliced garlic pieces. No seasoning whatsoever! When our waitress came back to check on us I asked for some cheese and salt. She brought out some shredded Jack Cheese. Can't say this really helped. I would definitely recommend the chef add a cheese sauce to the dish or at least some more seasoning. At least some salt and pepper. I tried to finish my meal but by this time I really couldn't. I took it to go hoping I could revamp it the next day. When I attempted to eat the dish the next day I bit into a couple of mushrooms that tasted grainy. Almost as if they were not thoroughly washed. I had such high hopes for this place but can't see bringing myself back. I love to cook and if I try restaurants who's meals I know I can easily match if not better execute  I can't see myself patronizing it.
For $85 which included a 20% tip (for our great waitress) I can not recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time because I really like Demetrios Atheneos and I love the food at Oak Barrel. 

I have to start by saying I agree with the reviews I read before going, that you have to forgive the service because the food is phenomenal. Our waitress wasn't bad but she wasn't great either. The food really makes up for everything.

My boyfriend and I came here for date night and sat on the patio. I really like the patio here something about it makes it feel quaint even though you are sitting on a busy street (a bonus: the music selection was great). We started with Poutine appetizer. I'm sure my boyfriend wanted something else but if I see Poutine on the menu I have to get it. The cheese curds really made this Poutine stand out. I loved it! For our entrees I orderd the Short Rib and my boyfriend ordered the Rainbow Trout. He really loved the flavor of the trout and the orzo salad that was served with it. The short rib was outstanding! It was so tender that I was able to shred off pieces so easily with my fork. I can't remember the last time I had Short Rib this good. It was served with a Whipped White Hominy and the best way for me to explain it is it has the texture of grits. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was delicious and paired perfectly with the Short Rib.

Note: They offer a happy hour from 3-6 (I had no idea they had happy hour until my recent visit) and offer $3 Craft Beer, $5 Wines, $5 Cocktails. On Wednesdays they have 1/2 price bottles of wine until 9pm."}
{"text":"A real mixed review here.  Some of our dishes were great, others just so-so. Service started out great, and then fell off.  We came in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. 

 My daughter had the chocolate peanut butter crapes. They were fantastic.  I had the crispy chicken and corn pancakes. The crispy was good, the chicken so so. I just assumed it was white meat, but it was not. Had a huckleberry sauce that was good, but needed some salt and pepper. There was none on the table.

Regarding the service, our waitress was quick to take our order.  I asked for a bloody Mary, and I got a good drink in a broken glass. I also asked for a side of pork belly when we ordered, and I had to ask for it after I was done with my entrée. 

They did make it right on the Bloody Mary by not charging me for it, but after two errors with mediocre food, I cannot give more than three stars."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times, but I can say that I haven't found anything to complain about! (Well, one of the bartenders isn't one of my favorite human beings, but, hey, not everyone can like everyone, right?) The beer selection is great and I love seeing B.Nektar mead on a menu. 

I've gotten seafood dishes here both times and the fish alone is so tasty! The fish tacos, though, were my favorite. The breading was nearly perfect (it could have been slightly lighter) and the amount of flavor in the tacos was in perfect balance with the flavor of the fish. We also had devils on horseback here and those were also delicious, though they're often not my favorite food because I like to have SUPER crisp bacon and that's hard to do with a bacon wrapped item.

The second time we came here, we sat at a table and the service was fantastic. I shivered a bit when we first sat down and the hostess offered to turn the heat up, but I declined assuming it was just leftover chill from outside. When we weren't warming up, I mentioned that we would take those few extra degrees after all and our waitress and the manager both came back to our table to make sure we were OK."}
{"text":"Forage, there is a lot to like about you, but some things left me frustrated and scratching my head.
The Good:
-Service.  Our server was cordial, attentive, and friendly.
-Hanger Steak.  Cooked perfectly, and the house made steak sauce was very good.
-Ohio Burger.  Well-seasoned, with Brioche Bun (more on that bun later).  Want cheese, that slice with cost you a buck.  I have to say it was one of the best burgers I have ever had.
-Chocolate Creme Brûlée.  I am a sucker for a great Creme Brûlée.  I like that they thought out of the box and used Chocolate instead of the traditional custard filling. The chocolate was creamy and smooth, but I still prefer custard.
Now the Bad:
-Bavarian Pretzel Appetizer.  2 pretzels...$8 bucks.  Yes, that's correct.  2 pretzels....$8 bucks. Now the pretzels were excellent-soft, warm, chewy.  For the price I was expecting at least 4.  I have had pretzel appetizers at a million places and have never had less than four pretzels in the order.  I want somebody at Forage to try and justify charging $8 for this appetizer.  When our server brought the two pretzels sitting on a wooden serving board, my wife and I looked at each other like you have got to be kidding me!
-That Brioche Bun.  Would have been great, but the bottom was so wet and soggy, that it disintegrated in my hands on the first bite.  This really takes away from how good the burger was overall.
-Atmosphere.  Left a lot to be desired.  It is way too dark in there at night.  I could barely read the menu and the decor makes it look even darker.  I felt like we were having dinner in a dimly lit basement and I wanted to take a nap afterwards.
Overall, I wanted to really give this place 4 stars, but my visit left alot to be desired, so they lose a star.  I don't know if I would make it a point to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm leary of letting others know about this gem of a restaurant but it's too good to keep it a secret.  If you are into fresh ingredients, locally sourced food and a great meal, you must try forage. My favorites are: the cheese board, mahi mahi tacos, key lime tart, burgers and more!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Forage last night for the first time. Great locally sourced food and wonderful service. We shared the Charcuterie board and enjoyed the short ribs and hanger steak that was a chalkboard special. All the food was just so fresh and flavorful. I will definitely be back many times! Love that they have a taco Tuesday and a Vegan night as well. Another great addition to the Cleveland restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Needed an upscale (but casual) spot for a couples dinner this past weekend, and Forage was the perfect fit.  Four of us shared a booth where we ate, drank and talked (quiet atmosphere here).  I really enjoyed their unique selection of beers and tried a few I had never had before.  My wife loved her black mission fig Manhattan cocktail...two in fact!

The three appetizers we shared around the table were all very good...mushroom toast (the best of the three), crisp cauliflower and a Bavarian pretzel.  The mushroom toast had a slight hint of French toast to it, covered with wild mushrooms and a poached egg that made for a delicious mess.  The cauliflower was a surprising hit, seasoned with both ginger and a lime chili relish giving it a great tang along with the crispy \"skin\".  For some reason, I've become a big pretzel fan the last few years and am always trying one when available on a menu.  Forage's version included two large pretzel sticks along with two dipping options - a craft beer mustard (tangy and bitey) and a white cheese (fontina I think?) sauce.  I used both options equally and they were both excellent.

After all that food, my wife and I decided to split one burger with a side of fries.  Our Ohio beef cheeseburger was cooked a perfect medium-rare and was delicious.  Certainly one of the better burgers I've had around Cleveland...and I've had a lot!  The accompanying fries were crispy and dipped well in their homemade mustard, ketchup and mayo that came on the side of the burger platter.

This was a better-than-expected meal in this hip, streetside setting.  Will definitely come back when we're in need of a Lakewood area spot for dinner."}
{"text":"Just excellent! It has a definite Deagan's vibe which is understandable because Demetrios was the original chef at Deagan's.   My wife and I split a burger, fancy fries and habanero cilantro wings. Thus may be the best burger that have had and that includes the B Spot burger. Tons of local food on the menu and everything seemed very fresh. Looking forward to visiting again. They have daily and monthly specials along with happy hour specials. They will be doing a ongoing renovation through Spring including moving the bathrooms inside from the current location in the hall. They will also be creating a more open patio and front entrance."}
{"text":"Food, mind you, is cher but deliciois, but the cocktails. You will not find better, only equal to. I'd gladly eat or drink here, and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful but the service is hit or miss. The first time we went our server was wonderful. She took the time to explain things and was very attentive. The second time the service was horrible but that was understandable because it was Lakewood's summer meltdown. The last time we went the service was atrocious. It took us ten minutes to be greeted by a server and when we finally were she was apologetic but awkward and continued to ignore us the rest of the night. I really love the food that's why I'm giving this place 4 stars. But for how expensive the food is and it being somewhere in between fine dining and a bar, you need good service to charge what you do for the food."}
{"text":"I really say 4.5 stars.  The food is exceptionally good. It's like a notch up in quality and preparation from Oak Barrel. The burgers are probably my favorite in Cleveland with a host of high end ingredients. 

The Devils on horseback are crispy and full of flavor. I think they are a tad better than I've had at other places in the area. 

Beef short rib had incredible flavor with a perfect hominy grit and sauce that brings it together. 

I am not vegan but the Israeli couscous salad with house made huckleberry dressing is filling and delicious. 

Best of all is the insanely awesome Single Origin Belgian Chocolate Creme dessert. Like the best chocolate creme brûlée ever. I mean ever. Get it if you love chocolate you will love this. 

The only downside in the place is the dining room and music fight against the food. I am glad it is casual and not \"fine dining\" inside but the rock music that is playing sometimes and the dated environment of the dining room just doesn't jive with the high level of food that is being served."}
{"text":"Forage is one of my favorite places in the Cleveland area! The ingredients are locally-sourced, and the flavor is beyond amazing. They also have great vegetarian options. I had the mushroom fettuccine, which consisted of delicate homemade noodles, different kinds of foraged mushrooms, and a sauce that is absolutely to die for. Amazingly, a comfort food such as this tasted as healthy as it was heavenly. My friend and I finished the food off with one of their specialty ales. 

I have also been here multiple other times and have sampled the cheese plates, and the tacos on Taco Tuesday. The quality does not change. The food is pricey, but as I say with all the other finer establishments I've visited, you pay a price for excellence--in the form of delicious food, drink, and phenomenal service. 

Take a look at their all-day menu here: http://foragepublichouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/forage_menu_mar16.pdf"}
{"text":"Great return visit with a group.  Service from Suzanne was terrific.  Everything on the table was delicious...poutine, kebabs, burgers, oyster po boy, hanger steak, pomme frites, Chai creme brûlée, s'mores dessert, and chocolate raspberry ice cream.  And I didn't even mention their great beer list.  The Dark Horse Plead the 5th Stout is delish.  Make a reservation. It fills up on weekends.  Always a great call."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Forage several times, both at the bar and seated in the restaurant.  Always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.   But tonight my wife and sister-in- law were disappointed to be charged $3 each for a cup of hot water. They did not order tea; simply hot water and lemon. Explanation given by the bartender was because of the labor in cutting the lemons.  Not convinced on that -- they don't charge for ice water with lemon.  Otherwise, we love Forage."}
{"text":"Thier tacos are so good. The seasoning on them in unique... In a good way. Very nice lean chicken and ripe tomatoes. The fries are a real winner. The rosemary in juxtaposition with tithe house made mayo is stellar. Great for lunch as well. I've heard people rant and rave about the BLT but I was never fond of pork. I may have to try it. Then do a marathon to burn it off."}
{"text":"Amazing is an understatement. The banh mi is spot on and the osso bucco falls right off the bone. Also, once you order a cheese board from a place like this all other cheeses become forever inferior. I always look forward to brining people here."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch or dinner in Lakewood.  Many vegetarian and vegan options.  Everything is fresh and labeled with source of origin.  Upscale atmosphere with casual dress code.  Wide ranges of prices, so doesn't require a large bill.  Daily specials and daily discounts."}
{"text":"Great service.  Not terrible food.  Over priced for the experience."}
{"text":"Recently I had to choose a venue for a sad occasion: a reception following my Mom's funeral. It happened suddenly and I had to choose quickly because of people's travel schedules. I was surprised that most venues in Lakewood charged high deposits/minimums, and worse, were quite callous that my Mom had died the day before. I had one GM say \"that's so weird you need a place for a reception-- I'm Italian and we just make a bunch of food and have people over.\" Uh, thanks, Guy, for suggesting my family is inadequate- wow. Anyway, I had passed by Forage on my way to Lakewood hospital several times over the past couple weeks, and it looked so nice - attractive diners out on the patio enjoying what looked and smelled like beautifully crafted food. I was worried it would be expensive but I needed a place, so I decided to give it a shot and went in the cozy main dining area to talk to the GM, Nico, who helped restore my faith in humanity. He said we were very welcome and offered sincere condolences, and wasn't so uptight with the #s. We booked there right away. So glad we did.

Getting there, the beautiful and cool day manager, Lauren, helped us out straightaway. We wanted to move our location within the restaurant and she made that happen hassle free and flawlessly. She knew about the reason for the event and was warm and helpful without being overbearing. Truly outstanding service. 

And then the food: amazing. I wasn't tremendously hungry but still enjoyed all the food: we opted for the dipping sauces so we could try all of them, and the ginger soy sauce for the wings is great (I think they should ditch the habanero - too hot for the vast majority of people and it didn't taste like much). The Angels on horseback were amazing! Sadly only three  per order, so I ordered like 4 of them because we loved those. The burger was amazing, and the key lime pie was great for dessert. Got a few other things I can't remember but they were all good. 

At the end, after the other guests left, I sampled a couple of bourbons from their solid collection, and mourned my Mom the Irish way. The bartender was not stingy and he was very kind. I can't remember what we talked about, but they say you don't remember people by what they said but how they made you feel. The bartender and the rest of the staff made me feel good and well taken care of. They were respectful and kind. And the food was delicious. That's what I want in a restaurant. I'll never forget this place and I will visit every time I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Forage has a great brunch menu! While the prices are expensive, you get HUGE portions. Anything with their preserves or berry syrup is delicious. Bloody Mary's here aren't worth it, in my opinion, since they start at $10 and then go up if you want add-ons.

I like Forage because they have plenty of vegetarian options and have a lot of seating (especially for brunch!) so you never have to wait to get a table. Their patio is also nice in warmer weather.

I wish the menu for brunch was just a tad less expensive or had SOME kind of specials. Either way, their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Really love the mussels great atmosphere and the food was good theService was good overall enjoyed my experience"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had lunch here with my girlfriend on a Wednesday & took my husband back on Sunday. It's worth the drive from Akron because the crispy cauliflower is one of the best appetizers I've had. The crispy perch sandwich was moist, tasty & enough to share, since the appetizer is huge. The brunch menu is an addition to the regular menu on Saturday & Sunday. The corn pancakes are perfect, soft interiors with a slightly crunchy exterior, served with a berry syrup.  My husband had the beef hash, a deconstructed version which he loved.  It's well worth the drive for us.  We'll be coming back for more.  The deserts looked great but we were all too full to even attempt it. Beer & wine menu is interesting & reasonable. Wednesday's are \"1/2 off bottles of wine\"."}
{"text":"They offer some of the best fish tacos and burgers ive had in the cleveland area. Love this place!"}
{"text":"With all the fabulous restaurants in the area, Forage is one of the best. Great experience all around. Devils on Horseback, beet salad, mushroom fettuccine and two dollar tacos on Tuesday would bring us back. Our server, Shannon, was attentive and pleasant. We sat on the patio. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Trendy Cleveland foodie spot with some pretty unique recipes.   I would tend to stick to the specialties in a place like this, but everything had a discerning chef's type of twist or flavor.     

Price was reasonable, comparable to anything you would pay in the trendier new Cleveland bars.   I got the Amish fried Chicken and Jalapeno cornbread style pancakes, they came with chipotle butter and berry syrup on the side.....  pretty delicious!  

If you want a more foodie vibe than your traditional Lakewood staples, this place is worth a look.    Food was really damn good.    The bavarian pretzel with Fontina cheese fondue and spicy mustard was also excellent!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Forage as I live right down the street, but finally gave it a try and I was not impressed. Maybe we ordered the wrong items? But our waitress was also pretty rude...

I got the chicken tacos, which were pretty flavorless and just bleh. Maybe flour tortillas just aren't my thing? A few people in our group got salads and said they were pretty dull and contained quite a lot of iceberg lettuce (not purposefully). We ordered a few appetizers that were unmemorable. Also, definitely overpriced for what you are getting. 

Our waitress was rude. She walked away from our table while someone was asking her a question and she wanted my attention to ask me for my order by calling out \"hey, striped shirt\" from across the table. Just rude. 

We might give it another chance... we might not. Maybe we went on an off day."}
{"text":"One word. Unimpressed.

Service - Sat at the bar with maybe 7 to 10 other patrons. So not busy in my book when compared to other restaurants with bar seating. One server and I don't think he was overwhelmed. Beer glass sat empty for over 5 minutes before he came over to check on the couple next to us. When he got by me, afraid that he'd ignore me again, I asked if we could be helped next. He cut me off and said that he'd be over when he's done with them. Ok.... As we were leaving he apologized for the service. So he knew the service was bad? 

Food - Had the reuben made with pastrami. The pastrami was thick sliced and somewhat tough. Maybe it's my dislike of thick cut meets. A sandwich should be easy to eat and this one was not. Flavor of everything was good. The preparation was not up to par. I thought I'd be getting house made chips on the side and I'm almost certain they were GFS kettle chips. I should have asked in advance. 

Beverages - The craft beer selection was decent. I understand you have fancy beer glasses, but a 5% ABV pale ale should not be servied in a 10 oz stemmed glass. And then to charge the same as a pint of another craft pale? If I go back I will ask in advance what style glass my beer will be served in.  Higher ABV beers are served in smaller serving sizes. Learn this.

Aura - This restaurant used to be a sport bar. It is now a gastropub. One would not know it's a gastropub. I now understand why Pacers closed and this place opened within weeks instead of the months a conversion usually takes. They slapped on some paint, changed the sign, and reopened. The old bar is still there. Old fixtures are still there. This is probably the least important to me. Food and services and most important. I simply was not impressed at all with the very slight upgrades that were done."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to do a date night at the Forage house as we both haven't been before. 

We sat at the bar and were greeted by a nice gentleman named Tom, who was working his butt off and doing it with what appeared to be ease. He got us our drinks and an appetizer. We shared the Bavarian Pretzels. They came out fast and piping hot. 

I ordered the Hash n Cure (Brisket, Potatoes and Two Fried Eggs) and the lady ordered the Mushroom Pappardelle. Dinner came out FAST and we got to eating. She loved the Papperdelle. I love brisket so I was excited for my dish. I honestly just did not like the brisket, the fat portion particularly (I eat a ton of brisket and love every bit of it usually). 

Chris, the manager I believe, came out and asked how we were doing at the start of dinner which was nice. Tom promptly let the manager know I hadn't enjoyed my dish and Chris returned and told me the Hash n Cure would be on the House. 

Let me jut say, I did not expect that to happen and was immensely surprised at how professionally both Tom and Chris handled it. Chris asked if there was anything else he could do to make it right. I thanked him and told him I seriously appreciated it. 

As someone who lives here locally and is always looking for a great place to have dinner, I WILL be back to have another meal here. Upmost class and respect, Thank You gentleman, you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Amazing local options - and I love knowing where my food is coming from. Great drink selection as well. Enjoyed the unique veg options - a nice thing to see in a world full of black bean burgers and portobello mushroom dishes!"}
{"text":"Tried Forage on a Friday night.  The place was busy, but we were able to get a table without a wait.  Service was very friendly, but was the weak point of the night.  Our waitress couldn't have been nicer, but she was not knowledgeable about the menu at all, so was unable to answer our questions.  Then the poor servers seemed to have major issues with getting the right food to the right tables ... The waitresses were scurrying behind them trying to make sure things got corrected.  Ultimately, our appetizers and our entrees arrived at the exact same time, which was a bit annoying.  Our cheese board also arrived without the baguette that was supposed to accompany it, though our waitress soon noticed the error and fixed it.  Service hiccups aside (and I hope they get corrected), the food was AMAZING.  The cheese board had some amazing choices, and the accompanying quince paste, honey, Apple slices and nuts made a great appetizer.  My wife had the burger and raved about it; I took a bite, and immediately knew there was some excellent meat in the burger, and it was going to be my choice for the next time we eat at Forage.  I had the foraged mushrooms and pappardelle, which was amazing.  I just wish I could have had some bread to sop up the remaining sauce, since licking the bowl would have looked tacky ... We also shared the poutine, which was great.  The fries would have been perfect without the gravy and cheese curds, but their addition evaded the dish even further!  My only complaint is that the chef could have been more liberal with the gravy and cheese, but the dish was still wonderful, and the perfect size to be shared.  I confess we didn't try any desserts (we were stuffed from dinner!), nor any craft beers or drinks from the bar, but overall the meal was great!  We will be back, though I really hope they can give the staff some proper training.  They keep the place from 5 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I returned to Forage this past Sunday with a gift card we had received from the GM after our previous experience. All I can say is from the start to the finish, everything...the food, drinks, and service were top notch. I had the crisp wild yellow perch and my wife had a burger with pommes frites. Hint: get the truffle oil with your pommes frites. It took them to a new level. My perch was battered and fried perfectly and was served with pickles, greens, and a home made tartar sauce. All I can say...it was phenomenal. The wife loved her burger and we can't wait to come back. This experience was much better than the first time around. Thank you to Niko for reaching out and inviting us back to experience the real Forage Public House."}
{"text":"So I'll admit, I put off for quite trying Forage for quite some time. I recently decided to make the trek to the west side, and see what it was all about.

I wasn't sure if it was the best dinner choice for a vegan and two vegetarians, considering the menu is chock full of meat and dairy. I will say this - the chef is definitely trying. All of the vegan options were clearly labeled, and the only mac'n'cheese on the menu is vegan. And it is a must try! 

That said, i'm still not sure what all the fuss is about. Check out my full review here:

http://veganhostess.com/2016/02/20/restaurant-review-forage-public-house/"}
{"text":"My experience so far has been very inconsistent quality. It's either excellent or so so. Almost as if there are two cooks and you hope the good one is working the time you eat there."}
{"text":"Nice selection of heartier dishes, good for a winter meal. My party ate vastly different meals and everyone enjoyed the food overall, although one friend found both the pork and fish tacos a bit too sweet. Kind of a pub vibe inside; I dig it."}
{"text":"Great bar happy hour both drinks and service.  Wish we would have stayed there, but happy hour ended at 7 and we decided to get a table for food.  What is with the food?!?!

Goat Cheese Croquettes - Both the croquettes and the sauce were room temp.
Beef Ragout Stew - A deconstructed beef stew with cinnamon(maybe nutmeg) gravy
Hash N Cure - An unconstructed \"hash.\"  Can it be a hash if all the parts are whole and not touching?
Crisp Amish Chicken and Griddle - Yes crisp.  Wish there was some chicken in with the crisp.
Creamy S'more - A refrigerated/cold s'more

I totally recommend the bar."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner and I highly doubt I will return. From the start, the wait staff took forever to do everything which was a total bummer because there was barely any one else in the restaurant so we were pretty confused to say the least. For the prices, the dishes were pretty skimpy and dessert was not made correctly and had to be sent back. No thanks."}
{"text":"If I could give half a star I would. 

Been waiting to write this to see if my feelings have changed about the place but they have not. So prepare yourself for a lashing Forage Public House. 

Let's start with my first visit with my fiancee. They completely botched an appetizer we ordered and it never came out. Then our meals came, then our app that we canceled due to our meals coming out came. Clearly the communication in the kitchen is top notch. The owners did the best they could to make up for the bad service by covering our drinks and giving us a $50 gift card. Now this left me feeling like they truly cared. 

Now onto the nightmarish second visit. It was Wednesday evening and the place was pretty empty. We ordered some \"devils on horseback\" and they took 45 minutes to come out!! Three little bacon wrapped dates took 45 minutes! My fiancee ordered some chicken tacos and I think the salsa out proportioned the chicken by 4 to 1. I ordered a hanger steak medium rare and it looked like a steak from Ponderosa. Now I have never been to a Ponderosa, but I imagine this is what a well done steak from them looks like. It was suck a joke! I asked to speak to the chef and the general manager tried to dodge him from coming out to the table. After another twenty minutes went by, he finally came out to our table. I honestly felt bad for our server since she had no control of this situation. Lets just say we did not pay for our meal but we made sure our server was properly tipped for the amount the meal was suppose to be. I also would like to say, I have NEVER done this in a restaurant before and I felt incredibly bad but there was absolutely no excuse what went on that evening by the general manager and head chef. 

For a real food experience, walk out of Forage Public House turn right and walk down the block to Deagans Kitchen & Bar or Humble Wine Bar. These two places have it right and know what good food and service is. 

Additional notes: Serve your beer in a pint glass or a goblet. Those 11 ounce glasses you have for draft beer are a rip off and you should consider yourselves cheap money hungry thieves. Finally, once you actually get your food and service on point, put some serious renovations into your interior. It looks like Pacers still but with a fresh coat of paint. 

If I was a betting man, this place will last no longer than three years in the Cleveland food scene."}
{"text":"We went to Forage a few weeks ago and it was absolutely amazing! Our server, Paula W. was so observant and helpful. We started with the vegan cauliflower which was delicious. I had the Pappardelle which was out of this world - I've been dreaming of eating it ever since we left. My wife had the Chicken and Griddle which wasn't as good as my pappardelle but still amazing. I would highly recommend this place for a semi-casual dinner that is reasonably priced, has great service and great food."}
{"text":"Good New American food with a cozy atmosphere. It's a much larger space than I expected with both high and low table seating, a few cozy booths, and a bar.

We came here for a dinner on a Monday night. I ordered the vegan mac and cheese appetizer, which ended up being large enough for an entree! It was a little sweet for me, but still filling and satisfying. We also ordered the fried cheese curd special (I lurve cheese curds) and they were comparable to the ones I've had in Wisconsin! I couldn't help myself...

And then my husband got the pork belly special. We typically get tired of New American menu items, but props to how well they did the dish. The pork belly was tender and its surrounding ingredients (egg, mmm) melded together well."}
{"text":"We went to Forage after some positive feedback on Yelp, but it definitely fell short. First, we ordered 4 IPAs that said on the menu they were 16 oz, but we got them in 11 oz glasses. We made a comment about it and the server just ignored it / brushed it off.

The second issue was that a member of the party ordered a salad, minus tomatoes, add avocado. The avocado was added, but 5 other ingredients were missing!!! That's not even close to what was on the menu.

Finally, a side of fries was ordered, and they just never came. 

Overall, food was a solid B, maybe B+, put with everything else, 2 stars. Pass"}
{"text":"I love that this place has so many vegan and vegetarian options. Some worked better than others.  The vegan mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had. The nut cheese is beautifully creamy, and crisps nicely around the edges of the small pan it's served in.  I would order this again and again.  

However, the mushroom bread pudding was essentially a big bowl of humongous bread cubes, with about three big mushrooms mixed in. I was hoping for a smaller, but richer dish that packed a punch with each bite. With this I just tasted bread and more bread, and the occasional huckleberry, which added some confusing sweetness.  My mom said the maple syrup on her trout made it much too sweet.

The service was great; our waiter answered every question right away, and made an excellent recommendation for beer.  But on the down side, interior looks like an old, dark, depressing steakhouse.  The location -- inside one of the ugliest office buildings in Lakewood -- doesn't help either. I so want to move this place to a freestanding location and give it a more contemporary interior design to match the ambitious, if not always successful, food it's serving."}
{"text":"Holy shit this chef knows exactly what he's doing. Open faced pulled pork and Amish chicken tacos were different and incredible. Completely new flavor."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and it was a great experience! From the above and beyond service to the fantastic food. I will be making this my go to spot."}
{"text":"Since we loved The Oak Barrel, we figured that Forage House would be just as great. It was not the same experience, and the food was not as great. I realize Forage is supposed to be a step up culinarily speaking, but it really ended up being a let down.

We all thought our plates were okay, but not great. Mine was the best of them all. (Salmon) The artichoke hearts tasted like pure lemon and were pretty mushy, but the salmon and potatoes were both great.

Oak Barrel is definitely a better atmosphere, and much more beautiful. I suggest going there if you are deciding between the two!"}
{"text":"Was handed the happy hour menu, ordered solely and repeatedly from the happy hour menu, including drinks that were only on the happy hour menu. At the end, expecting a bill for about $50, I received one for about $85. It was only then that the bartender saw fit to mention that happy hour had ended just before we had arrived. Any other bartender I have ever encountered would either have mentioned that during one of the rounds of orders, or not given us the happy hour menu in the first place. Food was adequate."}
{"text":"Absolutely loving this new place! Three visits have put Forage on my regular rotation of favorite food spots.

The pulled pork sammie was tender and juicy and barbeque-y luciousness. The poutine was reminiscent of my Montreal vacation though I did ask for extra gravy (and they happily obliged.) The charcuterie and cheese boards were well done. I am a bit of a charcuterie and cheese fanatic. And these are now in my top favs. And recently I tried the taco tuesday...I cannot wait to try it again! I had the Amish Chicken Tacos. They also offered pork belly, tofu, or fish but I was dining solo so I only was able to try one type. The flavors were amazing. 

Mixed drinks are strong but balanced. The Bourbon Daisy is my favorite. Beer list is well rounded with reasonable draft prices and bottles if the draft list doesn't speak to you. And at happy hour they have a punch drink that I expected to be overly sweet...nope. perfection.

Service has been friendly. The atmosphere is unique but classy. Would be a great spot for a date or to bring out of towners. Or anyone. And everyone. When you go, I will be the girl sitting at the bar justifying her second order of tacos and cocktails."}
{"text":"The food was all good!  
Party of 10, ranging from 3 to 65.  All found something to like.  The Taco Tuesday menu was fun and enjoyable!   The skirt steak was tender and delicious.  I had the mushroom fettuccine which was tasty and plentiful.  Brother-in-law had osso buco, ate every last bite!  Having travelled to Quebec and sampled Poutine, getting the other members of the family to try it was an interesting challenge, all three generations are now FANS!  It was both an epicurean adventure as well as an enjoyable evening.  
The wait staff delivery from Jerry and an assistant (I didn't catch his name); and the ensuing customer service from Lauren was beyond expectations.  
All of this group will return and try multiple items from their unique menu!
Great job!"}
{"text":"Quite simply, the server was entirely too slow and overwhelmed by having three tables. She shouldn't be a server at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate that I had such a negative experience this weekend at Forage on my first time visiting. It was busy (but not THAT busy) at the bar. The bartenders wouldn't acknowledge the three of us. When I finally spoke up and said \"excuse me, could we order a drink,\" after 10+ minutes of waiting, the bartender acted confused/put out/not apologetic that he hadn't had a chance yet. He said he'd get back with us. He never did after probably another 5-7 minutes. As we got up to leave, he said to our backs, \"what can I get for you?\" No eye contact or \"I'll be right with you\" or \"sorry we're so busy\". We went down the street to Deagan's (also busy) and were served within 90 seconds of walking in. BARTENDERS MUST BE ATTENTIVE. Don't know if I'll go back for food this was such a bad experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went for taco Tuesday and tried one of each of their tacos. They were all so good! It was honestly kinda unexpected. I want to go back because there were a lot of other interesting things on the menu, but I think it'll be hard to stay from the tacos!
As for drinks, I had \"el Diablo\". It was really good as well! I think it was a spicy mule. The bartender was super nice and went through the drinks with us as opposed to just asking what we wanted."}
{"text":"I need to update to say that I am moving and my heart is really sad. I still love everything about Forage and always take out of town guests here. Last weekend k. Town and was surprised with a free dessert and champagne toast. The great and friendly service continues, and this place will be missed."}
{"text":"Second time dinning at Forage and had a very good dinner date with my wife. We arrived and were seated promptly in a comfortable. We noticed right away that there was a good crowd at the restaurant, most table and seats at the bar occupied. The noise level was a bit loud, no need to shout across the table but you still had to speak up if you wanted to be heard. The decor is clean but nothing that going to get the front page of Fine dinning or Bon appitet.

The service was prompt, friendly and professional. Water and menu's brought within seconds of us being seated.  Nice selection of beer, mixed drinks and whiskey both small batch bourbon and imports. My highball was well crafted and my wife wine was fine, the single glass pour list was decent but would like to see a few more options. 

Started with the calamari that was good, as I stated in other reviews calamari is either done well or not. We split a side salad that was better than I was expecting. The greens were crisp with a nice mix of cucumber and grape tomatoes. The kitchen put on just the right amount of dressing, good flavor with out overpowering the salad. My wife ordered the Osso Bucco and I went with the Hanger Steak. Both meals were great - I really liked the steak but the Osso Bucco was amazing. 

We will definitely go back to Forage again for lunch or dinner. Nice selection of local products, with the rabbits on my want to try list. The burger selection and ad dons should satisfy most wants while the menu had a far amount of veggie meals listed."}
{"text":"I liked this place. I wish I had something new and interesting to add but the rest of the reviews I pretty much agree with. Good food, pretty pricey, interesting beer drafts.  We tried the confit chicken wings, pickles, and calamari. The calamari was really tender and I often judge a restaurant by their ability to cook it well. It had huge drizzles and glops (pretty/tasty) of sauces all over it though. Next time I would ask for that on the side so I can control how much. The pickles were great and for $5, came with a lot. Really fun and affordable. The chicken wings were really good too. Nothing too unique about them to be honest, even though the confit and creative sauces makes it seem so...but that's ok--yummy all the same. I really want to come back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Really good American fare. Really rich - meat, fried, etc. a good place for a large group."}
{"text":"This place was great being that it is new... The service was great and the food was so delicious... Talk about taste buds... We will be back again...  Looking over the menu it is not for people with undeveloped palate!"}
{"text":"This is a Lakewood fav of mine! The food is delicious... try the BLT! It's amazing. The ragout is one of a kind. To top it all off... Tommy the bartender is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to drinks, specializing in prohibition era cocktails. He is the real \"most interesting man in the world.\""}
{"text":"Great inventive cuisine ... The Trout was delicious, the BMW pork sandwich really quite amazing with Napa slaw and tobacco onions ... A bit sweet and very crispy ... Terrific!!   Meredith our server was knowledgeable and very efficient.  This is worth the trip from the Eastside any day ... Great add to the culinary scene .. Oh yeah they have Lagavulin!  A must try"}
{"text":"For this restaurant only opening 8 weeks ago, and having to change the mind of all the patrons that dined in the previous establishment they are definitely doing something right.  

You walk in and have a complete different feel than what you did at Pacer's. It looks more unique, emphasizes the farm to table with a lot of wood cladding, and just a finer feel with table cloths, darker lighting and an incredibly friendly staff.  

From the first step in I was impressed.  Then you look at the menu and there is still nothing to complain about.  The beer list has the basics, but it also has a nice genre of beers you wouldn't normally see. The cocktail menu really kicked my butt, I ordered a Moscow Buck. I assumed it was a Moscow Mule just a different name, but no let me tell you this drink was a Buck and it was delicious.  It had a little extra kick at the end that made you not want to stop drinking it.  

As far as the food goes I went with two friends and we each tried each others dishes to get an array of what there was, I ordered the chicken wings because I wasn't that hungry, a friend ordered their burger and added her own toppings then another friend ordered the Rabbit.  ((As I said an array of options are available for every pallet)).  My wings were so good! And if I was hungry let me tell you I wouldn't of shared them.  I order some honey, soy, chili sauce on them and it was mouth watering.  The crisp on the skin was perfect and crunchy and you could totally tell these were never frozen.  

The burger was cooked perfectly and had a flavor that you knew it was homemade with seasonings for a perfect flavor.  I must admit I did not try the rabit as I do not enjoy it, but I tried the sides he was given with them and those were top notch as well. 

We were too full for dessert or another drink, but I will definitely be going back again and it really is the perfect place to go for friends or on a date.  The price is reasonable for the freshness you are getting and you won't leave hungry.  From another friends I hear this place is fabulous for lunch so I plan to go back to try some of their sandwiches compared to their entrees!"}
{"text":"I had the French toast. It was good but not worth $11 I will try some other stuff and update this after my next visit but for now I'm not that impressed. John had the pulled pork open face and said it was good going down but came back to bother him later."}
{"text":"The atmosphere lacks charm and it smells like a Denny's inside. The beer/wine list is not especially good or extensive. Fairly average to even below average. The food was fine, and all of the vegetables and mushrooms were fresh. It lacked creativity though and I found the vegan potato dumplings to be a bit bland. The service was good. All around, an okay restaurant but not an especially wonderful restaurant. An adequate restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving three stars because I love a craft cocktail. And for a place to have such wonderful foraged and local food on the menu, I was a bit disappointed to see the small bottles of tropicana grapefruit juice on the bar. Food is great. Let's work on foraging some craft cocktails."}
{"text":"Well first of all- the food is outstanding! Everything was fresh and prepared beautifully. The staff was my favorite part- its an extremely warm atmosphere and they go way above and beyond. We went with our toddler and they brought her cut up strawberries, stickers, without me even asking. Just a great experience- a must try restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Good god, where do I start?

From the duck confit and charcuterie on the dinner menu to the open-faced pulled pork and Bahn Mi sandwiches on the lunch menu, you can't really go wrong eating here. It's like Chef Demetrios was born wearing a chef's coat and holding a knife, we lamented when he left Lakewood and are now elated that he's back - bringing his ass-kicking food with him. :-) Everything is so thoughtfully executed, not to mention the service is always spot-on. My boyfriend and I are thrilled to make this our new neighborhood watering hole."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to forage. They use locally grown food with a nice description of the place the food came from. The service is friendly and efficient. The menu is extensive. They have a vegan Thursday's. The el Diablo cocktail with ginger beer was refreshing. The blood sangria was sweet and has a strong cherry flavor. The habanero jerk chicken wings was very tasty however it lacked the spice and tangy touch. The beets with pistachio was yummy. The Amish chicken tacos was reasonably priced and reminded me of the fajitas in standard Mexican restaurant. Overall the food was very fresh. Good options worth a second try."}
{"text":"Forage is a good option when you are looking to a low-key place to eat with decent food. The atmosphere is very laid-back and casual. Food & drink selection are great. Deviled eggs are a MUST (delicious) and I really want to try the vegan mac & cheese- it looked phenomenal, although I wasn't in the mood for it when we went. I ordered the perch, which I liked, but I would prefer they take it down a couple notches on the breading. Just too much!

The concept is great and I love that even though the menu changes, they still keep the staples included. Maybe my review will change once I have the Mac and cheese...."}
{"text":"Was nice to be greeted at the door with a hello from hostess and bartender.

Ordered Poutine, which IMO was ok. Fries were a bit salty and cheese curds were ice cold. Usually they are warmed up or melted on top of fries. 

Ordered burger, after I asked bartender if they were ground in house, and she said yeah. So I ordered it MR. Came out medium plus and looked like a pre-formed patty. Still was juicy and good. I also had Gouda and pork belly on top. Pork belly could have been cooked/braised more because fat was stringy/chewy and not broken down. Burger also tasted like salmon, so maybe was cooked on a grill or flattop that had seafood on it. That's something that they should be careful with. Small execution things that can be corrected easily in kitchen.

{"text":"Forage is one of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood, and has absolutely awesome lunch specials. I've been here countless times, and more often than not the speed of service and pricing is ideal for a quick, 45 minute lunch. The farm to table motif shines through everything I've had here; the majority of ingredients are locally sourced or made fresh that day and you can tell. Some of my favorites are the BLT, the bahn mi, the reuben, the perch tacos, and the open faced bbq pork is some of the best pork I've had in Cleveland. Forage also has some great happy hour specials, and I'm not ashamed to say I've found myself here multiple times in one day."}
{"text":"Wowzaa Forage!

I really love the menu changes they recently made here and while service here used to be hit or miss, they've really stepped it up as of late.  We had the cheese curds appetizer (delish, perfectly crispy)... &those perch tacos THO.  You can now order 2, 3 or 4 (fish or chicken). These are amazing. I've had fish tacos all over the country and these are some of the best I've tasted. Great charcuterie, house made pickled veg and selection of beer and wine... I will be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Thus place is amazing. Possibly the fanciest place i have ever been to. Food, amazing. Drinks, Amazing. Service, Amazing."}
{"text":"What a wonderful gem in Lakewood! The craft beer, bourbon, and whiskey selection is outstanding. 

We started out with Pommes Frites served with garlic aioli. You could tell at first bite they were authentic Pommes Frites, double fried. The Rosemary & roasted garlic were fresh and flavorful 

Our two entrees consisted of short rib and suckling pig. Both phenomenal. The short rib is a must! 

To find out that the restaurant is one of two 100% certified organic restaurants in Cleveland makes it even better! 

I could go on forever! Must try!!! I promise you will go back!"}
{"text":"Very knowledgeable servers, and they're willing to customize an order if you need to. I've been to several enjoyable dinners here and also lately weekend brunch-- why don't more people go here for brunch??? It's quiet, the server is attentive, the patio is lovely in the sunshine... plus really good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Me and my BFF are there on Sunday 12/18.  Very pricey menu. Glasses of vino expensive.  Chicken sandwich is good but way to much white bread.  I liked it as Pacers much better it was more affordable for this location in Lakewood."}
{"text":"OMG! Get here! Ordered the Jolly Pumpkin Fuego!! Always amazing, they also have Mikkeller--on draft! Love love love! I got. Four peel fizz with my poutine and it was amazing as well!! The bartenders were on point and very friendly! I'm so happy to have Demetrios' food back in Lakewood!! Welcome back!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and has amazing food! The menu lists where everything comes from, and the daily pickles were awesome! Where else can you get $2 tacos on Tuesdays?"}
{"text":"First, I've gotta call shenanigans on Forage. Their online menu pricing is significantly lower than the pricing they show on their in-restaurant menus. Now I understand that they have the right to change their pricing, but this just has the stink of bait and switch to me. Don't believe me? Check out the images of the menu I've uploaded and then head over to their website and compare the two. One word, Forage management, consistency. 

Moving on...

Our main reason for visiting Forage, Yelper's enthusiastic reviews, of course. We got to the Lakewood eatery sometime north of 5:30pm on a Wednesday. There wasn't anyone at the host station but eventually someone came out from the back and greeted us. The place was empty. I knew we eat fairly early, but I'm talking crickets chirping empty. We were seated at a booth by the large windows up front.

I'm not really that much of a snob when it comes to decor/atmosphere but I've got a few gripes about Forage. First, the benches (cheap green vinyl, ugh) at the booths are not attached to the floor and they have a tendency to move around on you. I also think the kraft paper on the tables is a bit cheesy, especially for a place that charges $30 for a steak entree. Glasses of cold liquids sweat, the paper gets wet, it just looks bad. On a positive note, it is very open and the huge wall of windows lets in alot of natural light. The fireplace in the dining room will probably make a nice touch during the winter months.

NOTE: They are not cheap. Expect to pay over $100 easily for dinner for two with a couple of drinks. We actually watched a couple come in, sit down, take a look at the menu, mutter something about prices, and walk out. Just saying. Expect it.

So what about the adult beverage selection? I've gotta give them props for decent draught beer menu - 14 taps in total - featuring local and regional selections from Brew Kettle (Strongsville), Fat Head's (Middleburg Heights), Hoppin' Frog (Akron) and Jackie O's (Athens). Another nice thing is all of their draught beers are priced at $5. What they don't tell you is that the beers are served in glasses of varying sizes based upon alcohol content. Pour size should be included on the beer menu. Always. As for bottled beer, don't bother. While there are some interesting offerings, they are all disgustingly overpriced. Want an example? $19 for a 12oz bottle of imperial stout from Evil Twin. I wonder if it comes with a jar of lube. Mixed drink wise, expect to pay around $11 for a cocktail.

The menu at Forage reminds me of that Portlandia skit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8SjkDq2ZwI) - with its hard sell on the \"we know where everything comes from\" thing. It's very clear that's the shtick of the place. They've got a location listed next to nearly every menu item (although conspicuously absent on the vegan mac and cheese...what are they hiding?). I wonder if the parsnips in the suckling pig entree were humanely raised. How many gallons were in the lake where the rainbow trout were caught? I'll admit it, I am a bit of a sucker for it, even if most of it's probably smoke and mirrors.

No complaints with respect to the service. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive.

We started with the stuffed pasture raised eggs (were the other chickens friends with the chicken that laid them?). Three deviled eggs, halved for $9. Nothing special. They were good, but not $9 good. They really lacked a textural element and the pile of microgreens covering them just got in the way.

The rabbit entree ($24) was quite tasty albeit a tad disjointed in its plating (everything was separated - the reduction was in a small container, the huckleberries were in a pile, the grains were in a pile). The toasted barley and faro was well-seasoned and tasty and the wild huckleberries added some nice acidity to cut through the richness of the espresso reduction. I didn't see the point in the watercress and sliced radishes on the plate. Unnecessary garnish.

My wife opted for the burger. The stripped down model will run you $9 (lettuce tomato bun burger pickle) with most toppings costing an average of $3 each. A slice of cheddar will run you a buck. Want fries with that? $7 please. The burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, the brioche bun was soft and buttery. Not a bad burger. But the tomato was cut way too thick (thicker than the meat patty) and I don't think hydroponics does anything to add to the \"flavor\" of vegetables. More marketing mumbo jumbo.

Maybe I'm just getting a but jaded with over-priced, try-too-hard, slightly pretentious restaurants charging exorbitant amounts for food because it's local, organic, humanely raised, non-GMO, hydroponic, or whatever the buzzword of the day is. Maybe I just expected more from a place that charges $13 for a beet appetizer. Beets, people. Who the hell even likes beets? Then again, I'm the one that spent nearly $70 on an appetizer, one cocktail, a burger and an entree. Maybe we should both share the blame."}
{"text":"The husband and I had our 1st experience with this restaurant, not so good. Decided to stop in after work to check out their St. Patty's day specials. I was a bit disappointed to see they only had a plain corned beef sandwich paired with chips or a pastrami rueben with chips. I thought maybe they would have had a traditional corned beef dinner on the special board for tonight but nope I was wrong, we should have left and tried their food another night. But, instead we decided to stay- bad choice. We tried their poutine, the 2 sandwich specials and 2 beers. At first, I would like to say the server was nice and slightly informative when she first came over to take our drink orders- her service went downhill from there. We asked if we could substitute the chips for a salad or another side, she wasn't sure and had to run to the back and ask, told us we could substitute for the chopped green salad. Told her I wanted the corned beef sandwich lean with swiss cheese, she said it doesn't come with swiss cheese. I said, right I know I want to add it. She said they don't have swiss cheese, my husband interjected and said I see swiss cheese right here listed on the menu under the build a burger....plus his rueben came with SWISS CHEESE. At this point the server just had an attitude from that point forward. She brought the poutine with our dinners even though I told her we wanted the poutine to start our meal, you know as an appetizer! As the food goes, poutine's gravy was salty, the cheese curds were lackluster which they didn't taste like anything. The corned beef was disgusting. It was dry, overcooked, fatty and bland. A pickle was suppose to accompany the sandwichs, but they were left off the plates. As for the salads, dressing was really good but the salad was not quite the salad I read on the menu...lacking all the ingredients (spicy nuts & apples). We brought up the issues to the manager and she seemed understanding and actually comped a few items and gave us a complimentary dessert- we chose  the melted smore, this was very good. Overall this was not the St. Patty's day dinner I was craving all day. The only reason I'm giving it a 2 is because the manager was accommodating, certainly not for their food or the rude server. Word to the wise to the server (Madonna), don't take it personal when patrons point out inconsitantcies with the food. Nor does the patron need an attitude when they ask questions about the food or if something can be added or substituted. And to the chef, take some pride in the food your putting out. Great food concept if it's actually delivered upon.
We may or may not be back to try their bugers."}
{"text":"I wish there were more restaurants like FPH. In my opinion, these types of restaurants typically have the same menu and sadly, lack flavor. Not here, though. I was extremely impressed with my salad, and the dressing they offered. It was a southwest salad with a peanut cilantro dressing. Very good!"}
{"text":"Overall good, not great. The space inside is nice and modern, doesn't match the esthetic of the dated building it resides in. The restaurant can also be a bit tricky to find if you're not familiar as it's on the base of a large (office?) building. 

We arrived at about 6:30 and there was a 45 minute wait for our party of two. We opted to sit at the bar, which was fine but not our preference. The lipped edge at the bar made it somewhat tough to eat. We started with the vegan cauliflower, which had nice texture but was quite bland. I opted for the Amish Crispy chicken sandwich- all the components were good - fluffy bun, crispy chicken, fresh slaw, but all quite sweet so the sandwich was one note. The garlic herb fries with aioli were spot on! My husband liked the Cuban quite a bit and the portion size was huge. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and it was a good place to try with a wide range of patrons - couples, large family parties, singles."}
{"text":"Had Valentines dinner with my son and granddaughter here tonight! Calamari was the best, my hanger steak was amazing! Chocolate Creme brûlée,the best!"}
{"text":"Interesting place, don't let it's location (inside of an office building, on the ground floor) throw you off-it's a real gem. The menu has unique takes on classic dishes. My date and I opted to split the pomme frites with added white truffle oil. I loved the sprigs of rosemary and whole roasted cloves of garlic that were layered throughout, and of course, who doesn't love truffle? For our entrees with both opted for pasta dishes-the fettuccini with wild forages mushrooms for him, and the vegan mac and cheese for me. My dish was great-the cashew cream really blended to make a great texture that was complemented by the crunchy topping. Once I added just a pinch of salt and pepper it was perfect. My boyfriend loved his dish, commenting on the great flavors. The beer list was good-they offered more sours than I typically see at bars, let alone at a restaurant-bar."}
{"text":"Awesome food, exceptional customer service, and classic cocktails.  Do yourself a favor and have Tommy make you a drink.  Tell him the liquor you want, and he will do the rest.  

Great experience!"}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to finally have a nice farm to table restaurant open in Lakewood that isn't overpriced glorified bar food.

Everything I've ordered has been fabulous from the duck con fit to the fish to the pickles."}
{"text":"Between the Steve Miller Band (1120am), busy flatscreens and an dead dining room recalling a upscale panara crossed with a ralphies... I was already pretty bummed. Yelp needs an alternative, has given us pretend farm to table all day. 
MushRoom Toast, kinda wanted the fresh from the earth feeling on homemade bread. Instead we got a enormous plate of gooey eggs, exotic blend mushrooms from wherever and white bread ala \"Italian Loaf\".  
Corncake Chicken, Chicken was the best thing we tried, but nothing I cant get most places and a dry, somewhat tasty pancake which I enjoyed over my order of mush. Still very one note with COLD berry 'syrup'. 
Oh, and the coffee was like folder's choice. What is happening...
Two menus to 'choose' from was very confusing as well.
I dont know what cant be helped about the joint... most everything."}
{"text":"Forage Public House has been on my list of places to try for a while after hearing good things about it. I came in for lunch with two other people and we were all happy with our food and the service was great. 

I ordered the lunch special which was $9 and included a choice of 2 different salads and sandwiches, several to choose from. The special is available 7 days of the week.  I picked the chicken club sandwich and austin city limits salad. My food was tasty but the portion size was kind of small for $9. It was a half sandwich which I didn't realize, it was not stated as a half on the menu. The size of the salad was too small to accompany just a half of a sandwich.  It was about the size of a kids meal in my opinion.  My dining partners ordered the bahn mi sandwich and 2 tacos. The 2 tacos were small tacos as well. They both stated that they enjoyed their meals. I was tempted to try a burger but every topping other than lettuce and tomato costed quite a bit extra."}
{"text":"Forage Public House recently started opening their doors on Monday's and a few friends and I were looking for something to eat so we settled on this newish Lakewood \"gastropub\".  Forage takes over the location from Pacers, which had great burgers and ribs, and the patio was awesome to watch Indians games on.  

Forage disappoints terribly. 

I ordered the Suckling Pig and the Deviled Eggs (which they call something else that slips my mind right now) and what I got, apart from standard deviled eggs with a nice micro green salad, was a plate of what can only be described as slop. Torn, mushy shreds of pork, doused in a sauce that I would call 1-dimensional, as it had little to no flavor, and the tiniest amount of heat.  The presentation was disgusting.  It was literally just thrown in the bowl with no care for how it was presented at all.  For $22, I expect at least some thought into how the entree looks on the plate.  

My 1st friend ordered the salmon, and the presentation was just as haphazard as my suckling pig.  It was a hunk of salmon (cooked nearly how she requested it) thrown on top of some greens and vegetables.  Everything on her plate was piled oddly, and just did not look appetizing.  I tasted her salmon and it had no flavor, as with the rest of her dish.  

Friend number 2 ordered the poutine and the burger.  The burger was cooked to her liking but stacked with a slice of tomato so thick she was having a hard time eating it, so she removed it from the burger.  The poutine, which I sampled, was cold, the cheese curds had no melts quality which I have to say is a big turnoff when it comes to poutine.  The friends were adequate as well as the salty gravy.  This friend brought her 3 year old along who enjoyed the vegan Mac and cheese, and I have to say it was delicious.  

Friend number 3 ordered the cheeseboard and it was as a cheeseboard should be. 

I'm giving this place, which I would rate as 1-star, an extra star for the service. Our waitress, as well as every waitress we spoke to, was pleasant, talkative, attentive, and fun.  I enjoy having a conversation with my waitress, or at least some light hearted banter and our waitress was all smiles and quite good.  She was the star of the evening.  

When she came to arrange how we wanted our bill split up, she noticed I did not eat much of my entree, and questioned wether it was good or not.  I told her that it was not, and told her why I did not like the dish, and she apologized profusely and advised me I should have told her sooner so she could have brought me something else.  I still ended up with a $22 charge for an entree I barely touched on the bill, but such is life.  

This really solidifies for me that I should stick with downtown and my neighborhood of Tremont, if I want to enjoy a meal with friends."}
{"text":"I was here on Saturday night, about 7:30pm. My boyfriend and I were meeting a few friends for dinner and we arrived a little earlier. We put our name in and the hostess said it was a 30-minute wait, which is totally fine for a weekend. While we waited, we sat at the bar. And sat. And sat. Our friends arrived and we continued to sit. And sit. After about 15 minutes one of the bartenders finally greeted us and offered us a drink menu. It was steady but by no means crazy busy, but whatever. The hostess called us just a couple of minutes after we were offered a drink menu, so we never did order anything from the bar. We were seated at one of the high-top tables and waited for our server to come over. And waited. And waited. And waited. At this point, we had been in the restaurant for about a half hour without even a glass of water. Eventually a server came over (she didn't introduce herself) and proceeded to tell us that we weren't seated in her section but she had to take care of us. Ummm..okay. Glad to know we are inconveniencing you. Since we had been waiting for awhile, we put in our drink and dinner orders all at once. After another half hour our food was brought out by another server or runner. The dinner itself was excellent, which is why I'm giving my review 3 stars and not 2. I had the chicken tacos and they were fantastic, crisp flour shells, juicy chicken, and the presentation was gorgeous, so major props to the kitchen. All while we were eating dinner, our server never came back to check on us, or refill our water, see if we needed another round of drinks, the usual stuff. One of my friends eventually managed to flag down a guy who had been working behind the bar, to get us another round of drinks (which he comped us for since we had been waiting for). Finally, after we'd been there nearly an hour and a half, our server finally came over to see if we needed anything. At this point we were just kind of over it, so we asked for our bills. When she brought the bills back to the table, she made a point to tell us that she didn't realize our drinks were comped because we had been waiting so long, but no apology. Like, it felt like she was annoyed with us and had zero qualms about voicing that. We paid up and were on our way. I really, really, really wanted to like Forage--it's so close to where I live that I could walk on a nice day, the food was excellent, and I like how it's been remodeled since it was Pacers, but the service. I haven't had service that poor in a restaurant in years. I was really shocked because otherwise it seemed like a nice place. Maybe it was an off night, maybe someone quit and they were short-staffed, I don't know. I'll go back again, I'd like to give this place a second chance and I've heard the burgers are phenomenal, and I'll hope that their service improves."}
{"text":"Ooh I liked this place! My boyfriend is on a never-ending burger-discovery tour of Cleveland and I say this place wins. Everything is locally sourced and super fresh. My salad and chicken taco were flavorful and sized right. Service was so-so but they are new so give it a little time to settle. I was already talking about coming back to this place before we left!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch with my wife this past weekend and absolutely loved it! This is my new favorite joint. Reasonably priced, great service, cool atmosphere and most importantly the food, the food, the food! Locally sourced and to die for! We went family style and shared the mussels and the Amish crispy chicken and griddle. More than enough for two hungry people. I want to try everything on the menu and their other restaurants. I'm a local chef and can be very critical, but I don't have a single criticism for Forage. The bread that comes with the mussels is hard and once you let it get loved by the butter sauce from the mussels it's amazing. I'm sure this is by design. It's a massive portion. The crispy chicken was maybe the best I've had in Ohio and don't even get me started on the jalapeño corn pancakes and that damn chili butter. They didn't even need the strawberry bourbon syrup that came with it. But that was also killer! Lastly the the drinks were fantastic! We got out of here at around $50 - 60 bucks and would have stayed for  dinner. Total respect to the entire staff!"}
{"text":"Don't leave Cleveland without eating here!  Had a fantastic lunch.  Brisket hash was simply spectacular; mushroom toast incredibly delicious, bathed in wine and butter.  Staff knowledgeable and helpful; portions immense."}
{"text":"The food is great.  There are more vegetarian and vegan options than any other restaurant around.  Don't be in a hurry, though.  The service is irritatingly slow."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu! Great burgers, yummy fries. Can't wait to go back. This was THE BEST place I have been in a while and by far the gastropub in Lakewood area. I had the burger with foraged mushrooms and pomme frites with rosemary and roasted garlic. I was in a deep food coma for the rest of the night.  The atmosphere was nice and not over done, the bar area is attractive and has good size screens, and the patio is spacious. Service was good.  Best of all, besides the food, there was a decent crowd and music, but it was still quiet and private enough to enjoy a conversation at the table. I plan to go back as often as possible, especially before everyone else discovers this little gem and it gets so crowded you can't get in."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! I loved the gravy fries!!! The place is pretty pricy! I probably wouldn't come by myself. My man can come with me and pay for the bill!"}
{"text":"Chef Deme does it again--and he changes a frog of a bar into a respectable, hip prince of a restaurant with a unique, but locally-sourced menu. 

I've been to Pacers before and I'm not sure what other Yelpers are talking about when they said they can still see the \"leftover tacky.\" Is the space perfect? No, but they also just opened. And I didn't notice any part of Pacers in this renovated space. 

Now, back to the menu--unique, local twists on all kinds of fun dishes. Some American, some ethnic (bahn mi to charcuterie to tuna melts) but without the pretentious back-patting I'm used to seeing these days. That's right. No 2 page menu preface about how \"locally-sourced\" and \"responsible\" their menu is, just delicious selections featuring ingredients from NEO artisans. It's refreshing. You know, because cooking responsibly with the freshest, highest quality ingredients shouldn't be celebrated, it should be expected. 

I came for lunch with my family to try out this new restaurant and we were all very impressed. We shared most of the dishes we ordered, which included: house-made pickles, the mussels, bahn mi and the tuna melt--all from the lunch menu. Not only were these servings pretty large for \"lunch,\" but the prices were so right. The pickles were very good, lots of different veggies. Their take on the bahn mi was super delicious, however, the baguette was a little tough to bite through. Don't fret--it's worth the jaw effort. The tuna melt had too much mayo for me, but my parents loved it. I tasted it and the flavors were on point--just too much mayo. 

Lastly, our server was such a sweetie. She wasn't afraid to chat with us a bit, but didn't over-do it with small talk. The manager also checked on us to see how our meal was, which I appreciated--especially for a new restaurant. 

I have no doubt the 5th star will come once I've tried their dinner menu. But until then, Forage is a very high 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Forage Public House is certainly an improvement to this location.  It has the same layout as Pacers (I miss trivia night there!)  but seems to have a brand new furniture which gives it a clean and more trendy look. Now for the food - their vegan mac n cheese rivals regular mac n cheese. It is SO GOOD.  It comes in a small cast iron skillet and is topped with bread crumbs.  The cashew sauce actually makes it creamy and it is seasoned quite well.  I was doubtful but was more than impressed.  The side salad I got was also fresh and well balanced.  Appreciated being able to sub an ingredient. It was slightly overdressed but not enough that it stopped me from eating the whole thing.  My friend ordered steak and eggs and was very happy with her meal.  Forage seems to have mixed reviews on Yelp, some linked with service issues.  Did not have any issues on my visit.  I'm just counting down to my next visit - perhaps to their Vegan Night on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Poor food, laughably high price, incredibly SLOW service despite the place being empty. Avoid."}
{"text":"Where to start?!?

Came in with a group of 8 on a Friday night....the party ended up growing to 11. They accommodated us with a smile and not a hint of unease.

They must have given us a server that was well versed in serving larger groups because she absolutely rocked it.  No one ever had to ask for a refill, silverware, napkin....anything.  Separate checks were handled very quickly as well, something that almost never happens. 

The GM came out to personally explain everything that was on the Meat and Cheese boards that we ordered.  Extremely knowledgeable and confident in his descriptions and made for a fun educational part of the meal. 

As far as the food goes, you don't get a better meal in this price point anywhere around....you probably won't get a better meal at any price point.  The menu is perfectly varied...great vegan, vegetarian and GF options along with plenty of meat choices.  The selection of toppings for burgers is mouthwatering and although some would say the prices are a little steep on some of the add-ons, they are absolutely worth it.  As are the pomme frittes which are served a la carte.

I have no doubt that I'll be bringing more people back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I have been to Forage now on two occasions and both have been excellent.

I went with my girlfriend the first go around. We started with a generous helping of pomme frites and added in the white truffle oil (a must do, absolutely worth the $2 upgrade) and came with house made ketchup. I never thought having house made ketchup was so important until I tried this recipe. It speaks to how much thought they put into the ingredients.

Next she tried the steak, loved it. Well cooked, seasoned, good helping of delicious vegetables. I had the standard Ohio beef burger: tomato, lettuce, brioche bun. That burger was like butter, one of the better ones I've had. No doubt it was due to the meat and all the ingredients being farm to table.

Next up I came with the parents, got the wasabi lightly breaded calamari as a starter and had tacos all around. The chicken tacos: white cheddar, roasted onions, crema, grill marks on the outside shell. My parents loved their perch tacos, a nice Great Lakes treat. 

If I have one small criticism it's this: I had ordered a glass of house red wine and feel the waiter may have taken the opportunity to equate that as 'just find an expensive glass and tack it onto the bill.' It was a good poor but not a $9 glass of wine. A house glass of wine to me is synonymous with the $5-$7 range at most. But hey, that was the only negative.

Highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Forage Public House for dinner on night 1 of our cross country trip to San Diego. They had a great selection of local beers. I had one that was blackberry/lime and delicious! I then had the tacos for dinner, also delicious. My father had the prime rib which he said was one of the best he's had in a while! The service was so so speedy! Drinks came fast, food came faster and our water glasses were never empty!"}
{"text":"We went for the vegan brunch items they have.  I got the \"chicken\" and waffles, which is fried mushrooms as the waffles.  This is a high risk high reward vegan food option; because real fried chicken is a damn good thing and hard to fake.  The fried mushrooms tasted better than I thought they would with the waffle and syrup.  I thought the fried mushrooms on their own tasted like calamari (which I love).  My waffle was little over cooked and burnt (very dry I had to ask for my syrup).  I wouldn't get the chicken and waffles again. But I would like to try other vegan options in their menu before I'm truly make up my mind

We also got the cauliflower app which was very good. Their beer selection is on point!!"}
{"text":"I know this is a strong statement, but Forage is my favorite place to eat in Lakewood. I love any of Chef Demetrios Atheneos' restaurants, but Forage is just down the street for me. I'm actually a little embarrassed that I haven't written a review for Forage yet because it's our typical Friday Happy-Hour spot. I love Forage's Happy Hour! The cocktails are so incredible and the beer selection is on point. The bartenders are never stingy about providing samples before you commit to a whole pint. You have got to try the Poutne and the burger. They are both out of this world. The food at Forage (and Bold and the Oak Barrel) is so consistent and tasty. It's the same every time we come back, and it's always very good. 

I usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders are great. Very friendly and they remember you when you come back. On several occasions the manager or chef has come out to chat with us & ensure we are enjoying the food. Last Friday they handed us a plate of their Fried Green tomatoes, on the house, just to see what we thought. That's the kind of service you get here, they care about their customers."}
{"text":"Really good farm to table restaurant. I went on a Friday night and was seated right away (not sure if thats good or bad. On a side note, I didn't see any advertising or social media about this place, I found it when randomly flipping through the Cleveland Scene mag of all places). The server was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain each dish and how its made/best prepared. They have a good craft beer list. This would not be the place for picky eaters. Two of my friends just stuck to the apps. Besides burgers, most of the food is \"exotic\" -- duck, rabbit, etc. Not a bad thing, just need to have an open mind. The renovations they have done so far are unbelievable. Pacers was a hole in the wall, not maintained bar for at least the last ten years. The server mentioned they are finishing the renovations in the spring to get rid of the green bar carpet. They were also having problems with heating system so make sure to bring a coat. Overall this is a great addition to the neighborhood and I'm looking forward to going back. oh, major bonus - Mitchells Ice Cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is such a disappointment with all the hype and buzz surrounding this place you would never guess that if you are black in lakewood that you would have to wait 15 minutes before someone speaks to you. The portion sizes are bigger at McDonald's and with all the stolen recipes the executive chef should be locked up. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE HOPEFULLY IT GETS BETTER WITH TIME!!!!"}
{"text":"I see some Yelper's are not feeling the love for Forage, but that's okay, this is why I highly suggest people read a couple of reviews to get a mix of opinion before they decide to check a place out or not. Everyone has different tastes and different experiences. I went with a group of eight and I personally really enjoyed what Forage had to offer!

Forage is in the old Pacers space on the first level of the tall Lakewood Center North building. You can catch free parking after 6pm along the street or in a lot next door. The decor is simple, clean, and they have a gas (or fake) fireplace in one corner that looks cozy. I had reservations so there was no wait (but it was a week night so you could definitely just walk in and get a table no problem). No issues with service - I thought it was pretty standard, they gave us space to enjoy our meal and chat, but it's not like we had to flag them down for everything either. 

For the food I did get to sample a couple of appetizers:
-Farmer Lee Jones Beets $13 - One guest really liked this dish. I thought it was okay, could have used some pepper to season it and some more feta. 
-Poutine $10 - Came in a big bowl so plenty to share. I did like that they were fresh cut fries and they used cheese curds (instead of cheapening the dish with shredded cheese), but I thought it could have used more gravy (you're supposed to eat this with a knife and fork, not your fingers).
-Devils on Horseback $9 - Simply delicious! Only three in an order, but really tasty and big enough that you can't pop a whole one in your mouth. Definitely spurge and get this!
-Daily Oysters on the Half Shell $? - First time trying. Not a bad taste... more of a weird texture. Not my thing. 
-Stuffed Pasture Raised Eggs $9 - This was another really tasty item with six in an order. I tend to stay away from deviled eggs because I think they'd just be simple and bland, but these were so creamy and mmm good. 

For main dishes:
-I got the Open Faced BBQ Pork at $13 and really enjoyed it! I was happy to see it wasn't a tiny portion, but instead nicely sized so you don't miss not having a side and you can share a couple bites with others. I'm a firm believer that shredded pork tastes better with a crunchy slaw and this did not disappoint as it also had crispy onions on it. The pork had some sweetness to it and the cornbread was slightly moist. I'd get this again for sure. 
-Ohio Beef Burger $9 for plain - One guest said they had this in the past and it was one of the best burgers they'e had. Just watch out for all of the additional charges for each topping you add. 
-Bahn Mi $10 - I only had a small bite of this, and honestly I don't remember too much about it besides that it smelled good and that you'd have to have a secure set of teeth to rip the bread. It comes with kettle chips, but you can upgrade to pommes frites with garlic, rosemary and aioli. (Love me some aioli!).
-Rainbow Trout $17 - Two guests got this and the overall opinion seemed to be that it was okay, but a little lackluster. 

Two guests did get dessert: Single Origin Belgian Chocolate Creme $9, and they both seemed to really enjoy it. I was just way too stuffed for dessert, but I will definitely be back to try some! 

Their craft beer menu is not that impressive, but hey, they still had some and I was there to eat not be a snob about my drinks. 

To sum it up, I think Forage has some really great dishes that your taste buds will enjoy, but like every restaurant, they are going to have some \"just okay\" dishes as well. Perhaps I lucked out with my choices. I think going out with a pleasant enjoyable group of people also has an impact on your dining experience. I really have nothing that bad to say that would cause me to give this place lower stars. It is a little pricey, but still affordable depending on what you choose and the portions are decently sized. Besides, I don't know about you, but I'd rather pay a little more for a place that buys their goods locally and tries to make everything in house instead of getting everything pre-made, in cans or frozen."}
{"text":"I tried Forage today for the first time with a friend for lunch. If I could rate 6 stars I would! The wings were excellent, the sauce was the perfect sweet/spicy blend and the wings were cooked perfectly. We also tried a chicken taco and bison taco, both excellent. We shared the couscous salad which was a really large portion, full of fresh vegetables and greens all mixed in a delicious sauce. They are a little pricey here but it's well worth it considering the superior taste of the food and knowing the ingredients are all fresh and locally grown. I can't wait to go back and try something else off their menu."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch.  We got the jalapeño pancakes and vegan \"chicken\" and waffles. The pancakes were nothing special, similar to ones out of a box you can make at home. The vegan chicken was fried mushroom, which was horrible. It was extremely salty and had no taste. The waffle was frozen and heated up. It was not fresh to order. I would definitely stay away from the vegan chicken and waffles. Not sure I would come here again. The place itself is big and has a nice decor."}
{"text":"While the service can sometimes be slow on a busy night, the servers are always courteous, friendly and willing to accommodate any issues that might arise. Food has been beyond excellent every time I've been which is over ten visits. The burger meat is high quality and one of the best patty's I've eating in the Cleveland area. Also- the citizen salad is the best restaurant salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love this place. This sits close to my place and I'm here all the time! Mondays are $6 burgers (almost half off!) and they are some of the best burgers in town. All toppings are a la carte. Very generous portions and friendly staff. Lots of vegan/vegetarian options.

Tommy the bartender is awesome. He can make you anything. A mixologist at it's finest he can educate you on any drink and really knows his whiskey."}
{"text":"So happy to have this new 5-star addition to Lakewood's dining out options.  One of the best meals I've had and the chef here knows his way around the kitchen.  Here you'll find locally and/or sustainably farmed meats, seafood and veggies transformed into flavorful, creative dishes that won't cause you to feel weighed down but will bring a smile to the face of anyone who loves great food in a comfortable, casual environment. The plating is beautiful and the flavors were superb causing us all to ooh and aah from the appetizers to the entrees.  So delish!  Did I forget to mention that they feature a great selection of signature cocktails and a nice beer selection.

For apps we had a couple of the night's specials -- a roasted corn and a guacamole -- both enjoyable.  I particular loved the roasted corn with cotija cheese, served in an order of three small cobs.  The menu had so many things I wanted to order but I settled on the Roasted Salmon which I have to say was really perfectly prepared and served on a bed of smashed potatoes, artichoke hearts and kalamata olives. Soooo good.  My friends decided to go with the Beef Shortribs served on a bed of grits and the Rainbow Trout with an orzo pasta -- they loved their meals as much as I loved mine.  I can't wait to go back to work my way through their menu.

The table service and bar service wasn't great but it was then night of the Lakewood Meltdown so just crazy busy.  I'm going to give some grace to the mediocre service and the fact that we had to constantly flag down our server for more drinks, water refills, and even the check so we'll see how that goes next visit.  I'm hoping that the caliber of servers will match the food.

This place is in the running to be my new favorite restaurant!  A few years back I loved Deagan's, where I dined many weeks, but then things changed when to my dismay they brought in a new chef, changed the menu to not-so-great small plates and a dulled-out menu.  It lost it's magic so I found new places to fill the gap but mourned what it used to be. Then, by chance, while waiting for our table another patron at Forage House shared that the chef here is one of the originals at Deagan's. What? Are you kidding? How did I not hear this good news months ago when Forage Public House opened?  But I digress, what I meant to say is that if you had a similar sadness then you should know that this place is what that used to be but actually even better! 

I anticipate that that the Forage Public House will be up for Best New Restaurant in Cleveland!  It has my vote. Hope you'll go try it out -- I'd bet you'll give it your own two thumbs up.  It's a cool place now and I hear a remodel is planned which should bring the surroundings up to the level of the food and drinks.  

Love supporting our locally owned restaurants and seeing Lakewood gain another food-gem.  Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"I almost need to stop before I type this.......this might have been the best burger I have ever eaten in my entire life.  The additions you can put on the Ohio Beef Burger are amazing....while they are extra $$$....they are well worth it.  Lake Erie Cheese Curds...pickled onions....Great Lakes swiss....maple syrup cured Ohio pork belly....Dan Masters farm egg.  The burger was huge but every bite was fresh and full of flavor.  The bartender went on to tell us that they butcher their own meat and every ingredient was fresh daily.  There are a ton more add ons for your burger that I didn't mention.  I def want to go back to try another great looking item like the perch tacos or the Great Lakes grilled cheese but I think I'd just get another amazing burger.  We also started out with the Poutine which was fantastic as well.  The cheese curds on the poutine could be a meal in itself.  The old Pacers rib joint has a major facelift and it looks great and tastes even better."}
{"text":"The best burger I have had in a long time. The beef melts in your mouth and honestly a burger that doesn't need condiments. I got ketchup on the side which was home made and barely dipped. I gave a 3 only because the menu seems risky as many dishes on the menu are so rare that the matching of ingredients may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"After seeing the table next to me get a vegan meatloaf and a chicken sandwich, I asked the waiter to order the same and we were told we could not get those items. She said those items are not on the brunch menu, but from their lunch and dinner menus. She also added that the table is not in her area so she doesn't know how they got it. She could have asked the other waiter or her manager, but didn't. First time here and very disturbed at this tiered/class based service provided by this waiter.

As for the food, it was good and worth trying. If my experience had been better, I would have strongly recommended this place (4-5 stars). I would hope the management works on improving the service provided by their staff (or at least train this one staff member) to create a consistent great experience for all rather than what appeared to be a tiered one."}
{"text":"Burgers are great, hospitality needs some work! So my circumstances are a bit different.... The first time checking out forage was when Light up Lakewood was going on. It was a very busy night so I can't truly give a correct rating based in this experience. 

When we walked in, went straight to the bar areas to see if any available seating there weren't any so I went over to the hostess table. I stood there for few mins in front of two young ladies scrambling around without being greeted. It was very rude to the point on a normal evening I would've left. However, I understood not many places in Lakewood are prepared for the amount of business they were in for! I finally put my name in and waited at the bar. Well the same thing happened all over again we waited for about 10/15 mins before being greeted let alone served. 

The beer list is decent but they serve them in what seems like a 5oz glass (stupid small) 

Food - We placed an order of poutine and both got burgers. Both were very good especially the burgers. Will go back just for the burgers! 

I would go again and hopefully have a better rating."}
{"text":"Best BLT in town, best BLT I've ever had for real. Awesome happy hour and great staff. This is my go to in Lakewood for a great meal."}
{"text":"My fiancé has multitude food allergies, shellfish being the worst causing anaphylaxis. The server, Antoinette, and other staff members were fantastic. They were very understanding and took all precautions seriously. Now the food. Delicious!!! The crispy chicken and jalapeño pancakes were great. The duck confit is now my fiancé's favorite meal. The skin was super crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. Again, 5 Star all the way. Can't tell you enough how great Antoinette was. I hope she's there every time we go!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place for lunch. Great mussels and french fries and the vegan samosa is a must!! The orange sauce with the samosa is amazing and the service is great!! Definitely a must for lunch if you're in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Lukewarm feelings. I went with my husband for an early Saturday dinner, around 5pm.  Service was excellent.  Staff was pleasant, & not overbearing. 
My Blood Sangria was excellent. Rich, deep flavors without being sweet. Hubby went for a soda. 
Bavarian pretzels were good. Delish fondue and mustard for dipping.  
Entrees were just ok. Cubano for me, confit wings for him. Both hit exactly the same notes. Just ok, not memorable for being good or bad."}
{"text":"When the bartender can pour your drink and have a great conversation you know that you found the right place.  Great place underneath apartment buildings you can get some amazing happy hour deals.  I need to try the half off Monday burger deal and prime rib night on Friday and Saturdays but THE TACOS WERE GREATTTTT.  Happy hour from 3-7 is a great deal with an ample amount of seating.  Tacos + happy hour is a win win for me.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out and sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. And the location is cool. The service was also decent. The food was so expensive and, in my opinion, not worth the money.

My burger was fine. Nothing superb about it though. It was $9 and included no side. We ordered the poutine which was like another $5, to split among us. Again, nothing spectacular about the poutine.

I was super disappointed that the food was so lackluster and pricy."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp while stopping into Cleveland on a Thursday night and had such a nice dinner with my friend, no reservation needed we were seated immediately.  Really great beer and cocktail selection. I shared the poutine appetizer with my friend, I mean who doesn't like French fries, gravy, and cheese curds! We each got our own burgers with amazing toppings to choose from, I got bleu cheese and pork belly which was absolutely amazing!!!! Truly a farm to table restaurant, everything was extremely fresh. Also had a very nice waitress with terrific service. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"When we got here, I didn't know what to expect. 
From the outside, it looks like a standard bar. However, you go inside and the atmosphere is very elegant. Not too elegant, but not what you expect to see when you look on the outside.
Dark colors, great lighting and comfortable seating. Good music was playing.
We were seated right away and our server was super friendly. 
We asked her to pick our menu for us. She was a little surprised by the request. But, when we visit new places, we like to have our server pick what we eat.
She did great.
For our appetizers we had the chili wings that were damn near perfect. 
And also the calimari. The calimari was a bit bland and flavorless, but I think that's how most squid is.
For our main meal we had the pork shoulder and the kabobs.
The pork shoulder, mashed potatoes and small green salad were the perfect combo. The standard house reduction was so good, I asked for a side of it. The meat was tender and cooked perfectly. 
The kabobs were very tasty. The lamb, with the grilled veggies and tatziki sauce were an excellent combo.
For dessert we had the smores. While it was tasty because I loved burnt marshmellows. It was definitely missing something.
Too many marshmellows and not enough chocolate maybe?
All in all it was an excellent dinner, the service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. We look forward to next time"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and loved the food both times.

I went once on taco Wednesday. They had very unique options, not your standard taco - but in a good way! I had a bison taco and a chicken taco.  They each had different, but very delicious toppings such as cabbage and salsa. 

The drinks were a little pricey and I wasn't particularly fond of mine; I had the blood sangria. I'll say this was my fault because I'm not a huge brandy fan.

The service has been great both times.  The second time we went, we deemed our waitress one of the best ones we had ever had.  She came by to check on us, but wasn't overbearing.  I would say the service almost outweighed the food (almost)!

The second time we went, the food was even better.  My boyfriend and I split two entrees, which was perfect because they were both really filling. We had the open faced BBQ pork sandwich.  It was definitely wasn't the healthiest option, but it was worth every bit. The jalapeno cornbread was amazing, not too spicy, which I prefer. It's hard to find good cole slaw, but this one was incredible.  We also had the grilled Amish tacos, which were also very delicious. 

Forage offers a change of pace from the usual restaurants in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Well done. 

The first month of a restaurant is the most challenging part. Typically, I like to wait after the restaurant is settled in. We were so tired of the other Lakewood restaurants and just went for it. We had Poutine, Amish Chicken, and Short Rib. All were fabulous. The Chef came out to the table, food was on point, and service was great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Wednesday evening about 6:30pm.
Was lucky to find a metered spot in front, but I did notice a parking garage in back if I needed it. 

Walked it and greeted with nice decor, a Nice large welcome area and greeter.  Everyone here we encountered was very pleasant.

Sat at a booth.  I was surprised how many people were here for a cold January evening in the middle of the week.

I got the special drink of the day, I don't recall all the liquor in it, but a pomegranate molasses was an ingredient.  I was afraid it might be thick, but it was not, and it was very good. 

A lot of choices on the menu.  I love the fact they tell you where some of the food comes from.  A lot of local sourcing of food.  The prices are higher, but you get what you pay for, the atmosphere, the service, the original devine dishes with high quality ingredients.  After eating here, I deemed it my new favorite restaurant in Lakewood, and the surrounding areas! 
We had the deviled egg starter. You get 6. They were perfect. 
I had the perch and my dinner partner had the reuben sandwich.  Everything was perfect!  And I don't say that too often about a place.

We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wings are worth it! So good. We got the BBQ flavor. I also had the open face BBQ pork sandwich. It was so good I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"First things first:  The food was very good. Mushroom toast and oyster apps delicious. Pork taco was smoky and tangy. Bordeaux wine crisp and perfect to sip. 

Came for early Sunday dinner w hubby to unwind on a rainy night but decided to cut out after apps bc the music was soooooo damn loud and grinding, incongruous w the vibe of the place--zeppelin and blaring guitar solos were obnoxious and distracting (& i like zeppelin!). 

Waitress was trying to apologize and be cool about it. 

They realllllllly need to get their brand to sync up w the diners experience.  It's a huge room, tough to make cozy but they should be controlling the  lights, sound and ambiance of the room. Basic. 

Food and service was excellent, but dining experience sucked."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was pretty great, but I can not get over the price. My burger cost $20+ by the time I had it how I wanted it. Every single topping costs you an arm and leg. Just a poor value relative to other options in the area."}
{"text":"EDIT: They have changed the music

I love this place sooooooo much, I am here at least once a week. I just can't bring myself to give up the 5 star because after many, many requests, the music just never changes. The people can only take so much Modest Mouse, Cake, and The Postal Service."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow to start but great food including happy hour mussels ! Mussels were the best I ever had in town ."}
{"text":"Been a while since we have experienced Forage Public House. Once again we were reminded of the chef power available in Lakewood. A poorly attended lunch on St. Patrick's Day yielded one of the better corned beef plates I have experienced around Cleveland. I've never had an even mediocre experience with food or service at this establishment. Using fresh and local stuff when available. Top notch comfort food and more."}
{"text":"We got the Best BLT Ever, the Forage Mushroom Fettuccini, and split the Poutine as an app. All of it was AMAZINGGGG! The wait staff was a little slow so that's why there was only 4 stars, but I highly recommend this place!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"wow... I was impressed, wonderful escape from Winter on a Wednesday night.

short ribs... stellar, succulent, complicated and rich. Would have it again in a minute.
rabbit loin... playful ingredients worked well w a delicately prepared meat.
suckling pig.... large portion, deep flavors, comforting winter fare.

only issues were jamming all patrons near the fire, with 1/2 the resto empty. Noise level became very high, and the acoustics are poor. Speaker by table added to the chaos. Also, I don't like silverware on table in glasses for you to help yourself, cheapens the atmosphere and server did not refill between courses when the used utensils were removed... we had to take from an empty table... twice. Desserts need attention. Three choices were good, but to fill it out with Mitchel's ice creams ... well, you can do better. 

That said, I try and rate primarily on food... the ancillary issues will hopefully be fixed as this place evolves after just opening three weeks ago. 

server was very knowledgeable and efficient. GM checked on the table and the owner/chef came by as well... all nice touches.

great addition to Lakewood and the West Side. Looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"Usually come here for the Tuesday Taco nights, but the past three times I've been here, they have been out of half of the tacos they offer on taco nights.  Granted, I came in a little later than the usual time (7:30ish), but I was still feeling a little disappointed.  I would like to try the fish tacos one day!  With that said, I decided to forgo tacos and ordered the mussels-they were phenomenal!  The mussels were fresh and it came with toasty bread AND Frites for dipping in the flavorful broth =) Service is always top notch, there's no doubt about it.Lauren-the manager came over after hearing about my disappointment and comped the mussels and apologized for not being prepared for the dinner rush they experienced.  I thought that was a very nice gesture and it showed that they really do care about their customers."}
{"text":"I would love to give this a 5 but I can't get over the poor service. Before our reservation we had a drink at the bar. The craft cocktails are WONDERFUL, inventive and delicious!!!! Getting the bar tenders attention for a menu, to place an order or pay was painful. Once we sat down at our table, we ordered some appetizers and then did not see our waitress again for a drink order for too long... A repeated theme... She cut people off while placing orders so I had to wait for her to come back to add a side to my order. Then she had the hardest time diving the bill as we wanted to pay for a friend who was celebrating a birthday. 

As far as the atmosphere and food! 5 stars. Everything we had was amazing. From French toast for dinner to an open faced pork sandwich on jalapeño cornbread to a tuxedo board of meat and cheese. Everything was wonderful. The place is cozy with a great patio and the live music is a nice touch and very pleasant. 

I would definitely go again and would like to have my monthly Pilates happy hour here I will just hope for a different waitress."}
{"text":"I like Forage very much. Most of the servers are great. Food is fresh and tasty. They have a very nice patio. My only reservation is they seem to encourage children. The last thing I or my friends want to hear is unruly behavior, distracting our otherwise nice dining experience. This applies to any restaurant.  If they must allow children they should be directed to a children's section much like the smoking sections used to be."}
{"text":"Food has gone down hill. Vegan Mac and cheese was horrible flavorless gooey mess. I couldn't eat it. It went strait into the garbage. Crispy chicken sandwich was burnt soggy with sweet chunks of pickles on it. Would not recommend that either. My husband's burger was fine although he ordered pomm frites and was given regular fries instead. We also has a salad lettuce was wilted asked for crumbled blue cheese on the side but it was put on the salad. I would not recommend this restraunt everything was wrong or just plain disgusting. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"It seems like it is getting harder and harder to find places that serve fresh food. Or you run into menus where everything is so heavily breaded or sugared that you get frustrated trying to find something that tastes good but is also healthy, that it feels like you are limited to the salad menu and some \"lite\" version of a menu that is bland, small or just plain depressing.
That will not happen at this this place. It appears that they work minimally with flour and processed ingredients and have some exciting options to choose from as well. 

My boyfriend had the foie gras, which came with a maple syrup french toast and egg in an iron bowl. The portion was perfect for a meal, and reasonably priced for what it was and both the foie gras and toast were delicious, but not sickeningly sweet as I'd imagined it could have been. I ordered the rabbit loin. I was really surprised to find out the bone gravy was made without flour, and it was poured around a bed of barley, and huckleberry on the side. It was a very wonderful mix. The rabbit was incredibly tender, and I honestly felt the whole meal just made me feel good to eat it. I didn't leave feeling heavy, or like I'd swallowed done a bunch of chemicals. The natural flavors worked together and did their job to make a delicious meal absolutely guiltless. 

Our server was great and happily answered every question and even accommodated a grilled cheese sandwich that wasn't on the menu for my boyfriend who was having a craving. They have a pretty good selection of draft and bottled beers. The restaurant has an open homey feel, while still feeling like a nice restaurant. I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Forage offers some awesome vegan options. I'm dairy free so I often order vegan but after speaking with a server, the chef was able to change a sandwich to be dairy free for me. It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"After two visits, I'm happy to say I would return - both times the food was very good and I believe very reasonably priced. I enjoyed the shish kebab and burger, and recommend both. My husband really enjoyed the perch during our second visit, recommend. 

The pomme frites are amazing! Go ahead and indulge a little extra with the truffle oil! 

I also recommend starting with Chef's Garden Baby Lettuce Salad, I enjoyed it both times and it's a must moving forward. The maple vinaigrette is spot on with the other salad flavors. 

Service was good, and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan food I've ever had. Everything is good here, great for a date night!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious meal made with all organic ingredients you've come to the right place! We came to eat here on Friday AND Saturday night and it was very good. The first night I had the Amish chicken which was a huge portion and the next night I tried the Perch. Not as big of a portion as the chicken but still very satisfying. The mussels appetizers is a good choice to start. They serve it with French fries which was a nice touch. The flavors were great in the mussels.

The service was okay but I have to say our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. Since it is newer it is very packed so I would suggest making a reservation. We had a reservation for 6 and they told us they were just waiting for a table to get up who had already paid the bill. We grabbed a drink at the bar while waiting and there was a couch to sit on while we had a drink. It was nice not to be standing around or in anyone's way while we had a drink.

Since it was the old Pacers sports bar, I have to say they didn't do much with the décor. Just added a fresh coat of paint which was the minimum. However, this place is more about the locally grown fresh food. The menu is a bit pricey ($80 for 2 of us) but you get what you pay for. Great new spot in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times before and the food and service were quite good. Went tonight, sat for twenty minutes after the hostess took us to our table and never had a waitress stop by. Left. There were about three other occupied tables. I really hope this is an aberration and I hope they read this."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Forage for brunch for the past couple months and have had mainly great experiences. But today? Meh. They were out of my beloved vegan tofu eggs (I got the last batch last time I was in - early on a Saturday), so I got the vegan biscuits and gravy. The gravy had a strong anise flavor, which made it basically inedible to me. The biscuits seemed fine, though. But I couldn't get past the gravy.

I appreciate that Forage has vegan options and I hope that they work on keeping enough food inventory on hand to make all of their menu items. Pretty much every time I've been there, at least one of the items on the brunch menu - vegan or not - was 86'd. To me, that calls for a one star deduction. And makes me less willing to drive across town for brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went during happy hour, and the food is amazing; the crispy cauliflower and Amish chicken and griddle are must-tries. Our only \"complaint\" was that the service was a bit lackluster. It seemed as though the staff were busier preparing for the dinner service than checking on us. We will definitely return, but only because the food was so good."}
{"text":"If you're on the way to Panera for lunch, walk yourself across the street at eat at Forage instead. I scouted this place out last fall because of all the people eating on the beautiful patio, haven't been able to stop in until today. The whole meal I kept saying how happy I was that I ended up loving this place. It's decent sized restaurant with a huge outdoor seating area and a menu with options for literally everyone. I stopped in with my mom on a Monday at 11:30 for lunch and we were the first ones there. We both ordered off the 2 for $9 menu which is a fantastic price for what you get. We got the chicken club, blt, tomato bisque, and Lakewood salad between the two of us and loved all of them. (Pork belly is just bacon for those of you like my mom who don't know ). They also had a pretty extensive drink list in addition to the large menu. I look forward to coming back and trying both the bahn mi and vegan mac and cheese. I love the minimalistic decor and fancy plating- this is definitely somewhere I'd take guests from out of town to experience Cleveland. Local ingredients and a broad menu that they really excel at at reasonable prices? Well done Forage Public House, well done!"}
{"text":"Love this place. So glad we have this addition in Lakewood. The food is fantastic and original. No pretentiousness. Local sourced ingredients - you can taste the freshness. We tried several things today. Vegan Mac and cheese is delicious, and is made of cashew butter. Perch taco is probably one of the best tacos I've ever had.  And they're very good size. Open face pull pork sandwich is on corn bread. Really big portion we shared it between three people. On top of that we also had ousters and a couscous salad. Had a great time and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've now been to Forage six times and I have yet to encounter any of the issues that have been mentioned in negative reviews. Some people have different tastes/preferences which is understandable, but some people are simply impossible to please. If you are concerned about finding something that meets your culinary preferences, check out their \"all day\" menu. This will give you a basic outline of what Forage offers. If you don't like what you see, do us all a favour and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stupendous Sustainable Sustenance!

We checked Yelp for a restaurant near the Cleveland airport. Little did we know that we'd find such a fabulous one! 
I've been to restaurants where the menu has 50 choices and I'm interested in five or six. At Forage, I looked at the menu and wanted almost everything! There were SO many choices that looked delicious and interesting. I definitely want to go back and try more. 

My advice - GET the calamari. It was really, really, really (did I mention \"really?\") yummy. The sauce was so delicious and the sesame seeds added a nice touch. 

I happened to go on Taco Tuesday - when all the taco choices (except one specialty taco) were only $2. I chose the mahi-mahi (fabulous), barbacoa (ummm...yeah!) and the Asian one (can't recall the exact filling but who cares? It was DELISH). The presentation was very clean and simple, but not barren, which I appreciate (not a fan of tons of \"white space\" on my plate). 

Service was very nice. Our waitress explained their approach (all sustainable sources) and provided great service. 

Can't wait to try it again when I am back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service wasn't. One in our party has a gluten allergy and the waiter's attitude about it was dismissive. We were concerned but gave it a shot. Consequently, our friend was vomiting an hour after dinner. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Colorful menus. Lots of locally grown, farm to table choices. A great location."}
{"text":"I was not sad to see the old Pacer's go, and this is a vast improvement in that space. I love their farm-to-table concept, but it's how they use the ingredients and make them shine that really sets them apart. I'm a big fan of the poutine starter, as were the Canadian friends who accompanied us one night. If you're in the mood to nibble, their house charcuterie board is the way to go. And I usually can't resist their Lake Erie perch, whether in fish tacos or in entree form. Service can be a little spotty, but servers are generally friendly and engaging. If you're in the mood for a drink, their tap list is well-chosen, and the cocktail menu is definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for Valentine's Day and had a wonderful experience. Our server (Dan) was phenomenal. Friendly, knowledgeable - the kind of guy I'd want to have a beer with. 

We split a salad first - probably overpriced but solid enough. It tasted very fresh and the dressing was tasty - the right amount too, not an overwhelming amount.

I had a burger cooked medium with cheese. The burger was so juicy, the cheese was delicious and I especially enjoyed the tomato and lettuce. Hate to use the word again, but you can tell the food here is fresh. And everything was just so good.

My wife had the short rib with grits. Loved every bite - it was tender, the sauce was excellent and I loved the grits. Impressive. 

I will be back. Great service, great food, nice beer list. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great new place! We went on a Saturday night and got a table right away, not because it wasn't busy but because the place is really big inside. The food was absolutely delicious. We got the short rib and a variety of burgers. All the ingredients were super fresh and played well against each other. I love too how much effort they put on locally sourced food. The cocktails were creative and quite tasty. Great experience and a nice addition to the Lakewood food scene."}
{"text":"Loved previous review by Geneva A. that talked about Forage Public House having, \"...high risk high reward vegan food options\" so had to check it out.  Is the restaurant upscale or just over dressed? Walking in you have immediate seating choices to consider. First there is large comfortable bar seating, then a private area behind the bar or the \"more formal dining area\" to choose from. We went straight to the bar had a couple Citramax IPA's to start and dove right into the CRISP VEGAN CAULIFLOWER which had a wonderful lime chili scallion relish with ginger flavor.  Best restaurant prepared faux buffalo wing cauliflower I've had.  Next we tried the Blue Kale Salad (sans cheese) and found it spot on. A little to much dressing but very good.  Entrees were the Beyond Burger and Impossible Burger with sides of fries. How great is that that Forage Public House not only has a Vegan burger option but they have TWO!  While our burgers were good (liked the Impossible best), the hand cut fries were really oily.  I have to come back for the chicken and waffles next."}
{"text":"This restaurant was extremely satisfying. After days on the road living off of snacks I really wanted a hearty and healthy meal. It finally happened!

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is eh. It kind of still resembles Pacers. Nothing really special about it.

Service: No complaints here. Our server answered all my questions about the menu and was spot on. Friendly and efficient. 

Food: Yes! Delicious! We started off with the beets. They are served warm, well seasoned and come with goat cheese. (Goat cheese and beets are like peanut butter and jelly FYI). My party and I finished them in a few minutes..maybe seconds. It was a good appetizer for three to share, not an extremely large portion, but a good snack for three people before the meal. 
For my entree I ordered the special today, which was chili lime crusted tofu over a bed of hash. My tofu was crispy, well seasoned and not too spicy! (I don't do spicy.) The sweet potatoes were cooked well, (I hate undercooked potatoes) and blended nicely with onions, peppers and greens. Not only was my meal delicious and healthy, but it also filled me up, with a little left to spare in a to-go box. It will make a great breakfast tomorrow morning. 

I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu. Do yourself a favor and give this spot a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Dined at Forage on Saturday night after hearing great reviews from coworkers. However the experience definitely fell short of expectations. The service was INCREDIBLY slow even though the restaurant was only about 75% full. A drink order would take 20 minutes to get filled, appetizers took about 35 minutes to come out, and the waitress would either show up every 5 minutes asking us if we needed anything else, or disappear for very long stretches at a time. We were there for 3 hours and while the ambiance and food were ok (neither mind blowing), the service left me unimpressed. Will give it another shot but currently don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"In my opinion, a little over hyped. While everything seemed very fresh, locally sourced I'm sure, and decently good, it was just ok overall. I ordered the Bahn Mi sandwich and it was tasty but way too much garlic. The funny thing was the waitress asked how the pickle was since they were all made on site, I honestly thought it tasted like a plain old cucumber spear, pretty much no flavor, wasn't bad really just didn't taste like a pickle, maybe they forgot the dill? One annoyance was when my wife asked about the poutine, she pronounced it with a long \"e\" on the end, the waitress corrected her by asking if she meant the poutine (with the silent \"e\" on the end. Overall it was just so-so."}
{"text":"I didn't think I was going to like this place, but it was really really good. The confit chicken wings and poutine were delicious. The \"rag stew\" was great it was like a pot roast on top of mash potatoes. Only reason not giving it 5 stars was the service was subpar, but other then that I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday for dinner with a party of 7. The staff was all friendly and accommodating. Our waitress was kind and helpful. 

The reason I give this place 2 stars is that it seems that the chef has changed. We have been coming here many times in the past. But yesterday, the menu was completely different, portions were much smaller, and the food was flavorless. My father ordered a skirt steak which tasted like it was first boiled in water then quickly placed over the grill. Others orders were either overcooked, bland, or too sweet. 

I'd say the appetizers were similar to what we had the previous times we have been here. So we enjoyed the calamari and poutine fries as well as the pickled vegetables. 

I am really upset to say I won't be coming here anymore. Forage isn't the restaurant it used to be. I miss the big portions and big flavors! When the bill came, it felt like such a waste. 

I say, come here for drinks and appetizers but save your main meal for some place else."}
{"text":"Forage lives up to the name.  Wonderful fresh ingredients that you are not likely to find in other places. Chanterelle, hedgehog, and black trumpet mushrooms expertly prepared in the same dish = Heaven!"}
{"text":"Wow what a savory, well-made meal. Highly recommend daily pickles. I also demolished the hangar steak. Crazy good! And Tommy behind the bar was my helpful guide. You can't go wrong at the bar - purse hooks and a wide foot rest. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Really good burger. A ton of options to add on. Very nice selection of plates, prices from $10-20. The Amish chicken tacos were pretty bomb too. $2 taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been yet I highly recommend checking out Forage Public House in Lakewood. All their food is locally sourced from nearby farms, they are health conscious, presentation is great and food tasted even better!!!! Our server, Madonna, was extremely kind, knowledgeable, and patient, as we had many questions.  We started out with their delicious sesame crusted calamari and their poutine. Both very tasty. Then onto the main course. Today was taco Tuesday, we couldn't decide so we channeled our inner fat kid and had one of each. Perch, Amish chicken, pulled pork, chorizo and the vegan quinoa taco. My mothers favorite was the vegan and that says a lot coming from a protein loving lady. I preferred the perch myself. And the man absolutely loved the chicken. All in all you couldn't go wrong. Oh and for my vegan friends every Thursday they have vegan night, vegan menu varies week to week. Definitely will be back. Well done, FPH, very impressed happy customer."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Ohio! Great service, fun cocktail menu and good beer selections! It is a great place for date night, or grabbing drinks and some food with friends or coworkers. For drinks, try the Blood Orange Sangria. The Best B.L.T is truly deserving of it's name, and I recommend upgrading to the pommes frites with any sandwich, they are delicious! Vegan Mac and cheese is amazing, and the vegan potato dumplings are a delicious summer dinner. They have taco Tuesday (better than Barrio) a vegan night, and half price wine night. Their lunch menu also has great pricing!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Tuesday and enjoyed some fish tacos.  The tacos were good.  The bartender, Tommy, was superb.  I enjoy bourbon, and clearly Tommy does as well.  He was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about bourbons and made some suggestions.  He was friendly and talkative and single-handedly made me want to return."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends, and the hostess said they've been open about a month. That being the case, I'd say Forage is off to an OK start. 
Their menu is a bit confusing in the way that it is organized. But we decided to order several small items to share. We got the cheese board, which was great! We chose three cheeses and I felt like we got a generous amount of each, plus some fruit compote, some quince spread, some nuts, and some fruit. And they brought us extra bread when we ran out. We got the poutine which was really solid. Sometimes poutine can be soggy- the gravy was light which I liked. I might have preferred more cheese curds. The duck fat confit chicken wings in BBQ with sesame seeds were delicious. And the pickled veggies had a really unique, tangy flavor- I especially liked the onions and the green beans. So all of our food was great, and I enjoyed my $5 draught. 
Our server was really nice, and clearly knew her stuff, but was not patronizing. Everything came out quickly, though it wasn't very busy when we ordered. 
The vibe here is pretty weird. It's a gastropub with nice, locally sourced food, but it's in an office building with painted wood paneling, green vinyl booths, and generic oak tables. They kind of tried to redecorate and make it hipster chic with butcher paper and mason jars on the table, and with interesting light fixtures, but it's not all the way there. It just seems like this restaurant would be better suited to a different location. 
Worth 4 stars for the tasty food!"}
{"text":"Cool place with good food and great beer selection!  This place kind of reminds me of Deagans before they started messing with the menu every few months.  I think that's because maybe the chef here was at Deagan's at the beginning?  Anyhow everything we had was really good.  The chef came out and talked to all the tables for a minute or two which was nice...you don't see that at many places in Lakewood.  The menu is a bit confusing how they have it organized but that is my only gripe.  Price was good for the portion size.  This place will be really cool in the summer when they open up the doors.  I hope this place makes it in the long run, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.

Had impossible burger with their special spicy mustard. 

Appetizers of samosa was yummy especially with their sauce."}
{"text":"So, first I have to address the decompression pump that blasts you upon enter and exit. It very much punctuates and resets your current state of being. It ranks 3rd behind delousing, or stepping on a cartoon rake and getting swatted in the face.

That being said; The beets were unbeetable...... BOOM! get it?

The bacon wrapped ________ appetizer made me nervous to order. It's always my experience that these things are always too salty or sweet. It was Nom nom nom!!

Our server, Cassie?... Made the suggestions. She was everything you want your server to be, and a fine representative of the establishment. She took the time to explain at least 16 items on the menu....mostly because I stared at her until she decided she was done. It took awhile. Great job miss!

The rabbit was cooked perfectly. The flavors were good, but just missing the 3 additional grains of salt that I was looking for. 

The Perch tacos also, were just missing a little something, and were a bit on the large side for a serving of 3. 2 would have done, and not left me feeling guilty for having to commit to taking a 3rd soggy taco home. (But I don't eat much)

The drink menu looked like it had a comfortable and appealing variety, but I opted for a cola. Which was splendid. 

I found the restaurant to be chilly. We were sitting by the window however. We kept our coats on the entire time (but I'm always cold).

Going to the restauroom is also an odd reset. You leave the restaurant, into the building hallway, take a left, go past the elevator, shoot the shit with a guy named earl who just hangs out in the hall, and you're on your way. 

I waited a year to post this. This review was from early 2016. 

We will have to visit again!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night before seeing a show at Mahall's. This restaurant does vegan and non vegan food really well. My boyfriend had a bacon cheese  burger and really enjoyed it. I had the vegan mac and cheese. The cashew cream sauce was super good and very cheese-like. Our server was very nice and accommodating. I'm glad my friend recommended this place and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for both food and cocktails. I'm addicted to their specially prepared potatoes! The olive oil, rosemary and garlic blend excellently. Everything I've ever ordered has pleased me beyond my expectations. The cocktails are spectacular. Definitely a true dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a nice tapasesque experience last night. My fiance and I went there for the second time for a late night dinner. We went once before and loved the place, especially after sitting at the bar...the bartender was such a cocktail connoisseur. But the bar was full, due to the bartender no doubt, so we sat in a booth in the back. I wanted to sit inside since they had live entertainment...a decent acoustic guitar player. 

 It was an hour before cloing, so we decided to begin with a charcuterie board...the tuxedo board to be exact. We came from the Red Lanturn after tasting their crab cakes ( Yelp review still in progress) so I wasn't too hungry. 

It was just enough that late at night: 3 cheeses, honey, fruit, nuts, 3 meats, some carrot concoction, and bread.

Our server was attentive and very pleasant.

Instead of actual dinner we got their smores dessert instead. Although the Graham cracker crust was a little dry, it was satisfying enough.  

I hope to be back in the near future."}
{"text":"We have gone to Forage here in our home town of Lakewood since the time they first opened.  The food normally is very good and service the same. Tonight we went with friends and the service continues to be very good. Unfortunately, we can not say the same about the food. Three people ordered the salmon special and all three dishes arrived cold. The server and manager (I think he was the manager) came and took the dishes back to the kitchen. They apologized and returned with the dishes reheated. Unfortunately still, they were warmer but not at the temperature they should have been. The flavors were wonderful but room temperature dishes do not bolster the desire to return. There are a lot of restaurants to choose from now a days. We may try again with Forage but probably not with the friends that were with us tonight. Too bad, we have always talked highly about Forage."}
{"text":"Totally a fan of this place. First off, I had no idea that Pacer's even closed but thank goodness it did and this place opened. Pacer's was ok, just a dirty little bar that was always more than half empty. Now this place, this is what I'm talking about. The decor inside is great, the patio is even better and I cannot wait to see what renovations will happen in the future. 

Now we didn't have any food at this place, just drinks however I saw a lot of delicious looking plates go by. I ordered a Moscow mule and it was amazing. My stud had a margarita and let me tell you....that was the strongest best tasting margarita I've ever had. We sat at the bar and our service was great! The bartenders were a blast to talk to.

We will definitely be back to try their food."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and it was great. Excellent locally sourced and expertly cooked fare. We got the chef's specials--a faro and toasted barley cassoulet, and pork belly with polenta--we loved both dishes. Service was outstanding also. The beer list is a little limited, especially for Lakewood, but we are definitely going back to Forage."}
{"text":"They got rid of their AMAZING vegan mac n cheese. I craved this dish every day. I'm so so sad. PLEASE bring it back!!!!"}
{"text":"The banh mi is so delightful!! I think the veggies need a little more sugar but would be the best banh mi I have had since moving here. 
Sausage board was so good- two kinds of sausage and the house meatball. Yum! I'm not always a sausage person but I could have eaten it all myself. 
Also had sampling of three cheeses- goat, Gouda and blue. Nice plate and full of yummy sides. 
About time we got this kind of place in Lakewood!! Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"My family came in from out of town and thought we would try somewhere none of us had been. Very pleasantly surprised!! Our server have great recommendations, was very attentive and helped make our experience a wonderful one. I got the open face pulled pork and it was incredible. The ingredients are so fresh and the prices are very reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise! I didn't even know Pacer's closed, and next thing you know, it's replaced by the new gem of Lakewood. 

I can't say enough about how great my first experience here was. The service was great. Our waitress doted on us and had an outgoing, joyful personality. She made great recommendations and was never far. We did go at 8pm, so it may have been after the normal dinner rush. 

I had a bourbon cocktail that was quite good. Sadly can't remember the name, but it was a nice mix of spicy and sweet. The trout was melt-in-your-mouth good, on top of amazing puréed squash. It looked beautiful and tasted better. Can't beat the prices for fresh, farm-to-table fare. It was very reasonable. 

I can't wait to come back and make this more of a regular place to visit."}
{"text":"Cool, hip, modern, local food.

We were searching for a place to eat In Lakewood, and came upon Forage. Having been open for only a couple of weeks, we were surprised how busy the restaurant already has become (and we went on a Tuesday night!)

The restaurant has more of a rustic feel, but cozy at the same time. We were seated right away and ordered some great dishes: 
- duck fat chicken wings in TOB bbq sauce- they were the right amount of crispness and sauciness
- lake perch tacos (it was taco Tues) which were fried lightly, with a great sauce 
- pork belly tacos- I loved these as they weren't fatty- it was real meat in a bed of cilantro. Also it wasn't too saucy either (because I really hate it when you eat tacos and the sauce is dripping all over your hands)

Overall I thought Forage was excellent. Apparently, demetrios used to be the chef at Deagans before he opened up this restaurant.. So they have a similar feel. I really like how most of their ingredients are local to Ohio as well-(cool!)

Check it out soon- it's quite good!"}
{"text":"Food, service, variety, price point are all spot on. I really enjoy Forage and want to give it 5 stars. 

However.....the last half dozen times my otherwise enjoyable experience has been monopolized by screaming babies and parents who think that is just adorable.  

Who brings a baby to a restaurant?   There are baby sitters, you can also do take out, there are alternatives. 

It's frustrating and there's no win here for anyone.  The diners are miserable, the baby is miserable, the waiters are miserable.  

Please add an age requirement and then the place won't feel like I stepped into a bouncy house."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like this place, but I'm unlikely to go back. Went for dinner over the weekend, and the atmosphere here is great, especially he patio. But that's about where the positives ended. 

We told our server we needed a minute to decide on drinks, but she didn't return for at least 15 minutes. I ordered the mushroom toast and a blood orange sangria, and my fiancé ordered a burger and Coke. 

My sangria was almost undrinkable. Incredibly sweet and too full of liquor. Tasted more like a mixed drink from my college bar. The mushroom toast was AMAZING for the first few bites. However, the sauce had so much butter and/or cheese in it that I physically could not finish it and I felt sick the rest of the evening. My fiancé mostly liked his burger, but his ketchup was strangely seasoned and he thought it was a bit much to try to jazz up ketchup for fries.

Over all, Forage seems to try very hard, but for me, fell short. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough, but the generous offerings of locally sourced ingredients didn't make up for the poor execution."}
{"text":"We like this place, but it seems a little bit pricey.  I know - it's probably because the food is local and organic, but it's this weird cross between upscale and hipster that makes us just not choose this place very often.  I think it could go either direction - more simple, organic locally sourced - but down to earth... or more upscale and it would make more sense to us."}
{"text":"I'm not even going to lie. I visit Forage for Tom the bartender. His drinks are some of the best in the city and his stories are even better. You can't sit at that bar without hearing a story that will make you laugh, chime in, or just say \"there's no fucking way.\" 

The food is also very good. You can build an amazing burger with some of the best locally sourced ingredients. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly. Everything is farm to table and the quality shows. Oh and the chicken wings are the most amazing combo of delicious and weird. 

At the very least, go for a drink. If Tom is there, you will get caught up in a story and end up eating too."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a wonderful time. The bartender was attentive and the drinks were made with care. Our food was really tasty and mostly local. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Forage 2x in 2 weeks! Good selection of food. Great salad choices. Allowed us to bring a b-day cake in and cut it for us. I can't wait to go back in the summer to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"After deciding we didn't want to wait an hour for dinner we happened upon Forage and I am so glad we did! The menu had tons of options and the food was very fresh and delicious. The only downside was trying to get all five dishes out together. One of our dishes was at least 5 minutes behind the rest. That will not stop me from coming back here.  They also have a very interesting bar menu. Forage is a winner!!"}
{"text":"I agree with others reviewers that the inside and outside do not match in appearance. The interior is pretty dolled up while the outside, especially that sign, is very basic bar. The patio however, the only full part of the restaurant late one Friday night, was very chill and quiet despite being within sight of Detroit Ave. 

I love charcuterie boards and The Butchers' Provisions appetizer here did not disappoint. In fact, it ranks up there with my favorites. As the menu will note many of the ingredients come from local or regional locations. The baguette with this appetizer, while a bit hard, came from Blackbird Baking Co. The bread, apple, honey and brie provided all went well together. The chorizo was also really delicious and the service of it was ample. 

For my main I chose salmon. I liked the mixed baby vegetables that were served with it. The salmon serving was generous and prepared as requested. 

The sandwich of Brisket (from Ashland, OH) was very large. The meat cut was fatty. The dish came with a huge pile of good kettle chips and the same house pickle that was served with the charcuterie board. The pickle was really unique, a bit spicy and like no other pickle I have ever had. 

Overall I would return here. I enjoyed the little surprises throughout the menu. Honey with the charcuterie board. The house pickle. The pattypan squash."}
{"text":"My first time at Forage and I was impressed. Local, quality ingredients, tasty dishes, good service. I had salmon, my husband had steak; both were great. We also had deviled eggs which we both enjoyed. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here about a year ago, wasn't very impressed, but I didn't write a review that time. I thought I'd give them another chance since they recently opened and I live really close. It took longer for a return visit than I originally planned, but this time around I can say things have definitely gotten better.  

First off, the oysters. I've developed a love of fresh oysters after a trip to New England a few years ago. Since then I've had oysters all over the country and the best oyster experience I've had has been in Newport, Rhode Island, but the oysters I had at Forage were surprisingly close. 

When the oysters were delivered I was a bit disappointed they only gave us one little oyster fork because I was sharing them with my wife. I usually need a fork because almost always, except New England, when I eat the oysters straight out of the shell I've gotten little bits of shell in my mouth. This was not a problem at Forage. Not only were the oysters delicious, I didn't need to use the fork because I could eat them straight out of the shell, which is the prefered method anyway.

After the oysters I had the kabobs. The meat was tender and the tzatziki complemented them well. My wife had the mushroom fettuccine which she thoroughly enjoyed. 

Overall the food was great and so was the service. I'll definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Especially the short ribs. However, the service was average at best and the beer glasses are ridiculous.  Nothing comes in a pint. All draft beer is served in a 10 oz fluted glass. Really?  Even Fat Heads Bumbleberry.  High gravity beer,, certainly.  But nothing comes in a pint glass.  Beer lovers beware."}
{"text":"I had hear great things about this place since it opened, and I was not disappointed by the service and the food (Osso Buco & Burger) was prepared perfectly.  Impressive."}
{"text":"Overall, not a bad experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The salads were fresh and delicious. The pork shank was tender and flavorful.  The rabbit loin was very tasty. The desert, which was a chocolate creme brûlée, was an afterthought, and not worth anyone's attention. The wine list is the only reason that this restaurant is not getting five stars from us. It needs serious help!  I understand that this establishment is a gastro pub, but a little bit of attention to the selection of wines would take it to the next level.  With all of the excellent choices available from places around the world, it is inexcusable to only have a handful of options, and all from California. This shows a lack of imagination, in my opinion.  Ambience and decor were about average. All in all, good value that could be amazing value with a few tweaks."}
{"text":"Last night I had their Amish Chicken. Today I had duck fat chicken wings confit and calamari.  The calamari is the best in NEO!  All the food is unbelievablely fantastic!  Price hardly reflects the quality of the food and service. This is a five star place at a 3 star price. Honestly, stop browsing. Get to Forage NOW!  You'll love it and it will be the first of many happy returns!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday dinner, it was 4 of us. Our server's name was Terran and she did an awesome job, very nice, and described everything on the menu perfectly. Food was nothing but great. We sat outside, it was a nice day, so we had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and it was excellent with our food. So overall, nice restaurant, great service, and good food. I would recommend this place if they wanted to eat at a nice relaxed spot."}
{"text":"I thought I'd be able to pretend I wasn't at the former Pacers... Impossible here. I think they tried, but there was still so much tacky evidence. 

I do like their beer menu & that they have $5 drafts.

My rabbit was meh. It was tender and juicy, but lacking in flavor. Nothing else on the plate had flavor either, aside from the berries, which were a nice touch, but didn't save the plate. Even though I ate it all, I was still quite hungry. And I'm a fairly light eater. Unless you're a big fan of chicken & rice, don't bother.

We also got duck fat wings confit in habanero jerk sauce. I only ate one. They were grossly soggy, but not drowning in sauce, so I have no idea why. I know they were supposed to be confit, but had none of the flavor, and even then, should still be crisped. No one likes soggy chicken wings. And while I recognize habanero is muy caliente, there was no other flavor to be had. Skip the wings.

We ordered frites afterward because both of us were left hungry. Those were good. Pretty much like most other frites you've had. Nothing special, but nothing wrong with them either. 

This place is really close to where we live, so we were hoping to love it, and the menu sounded like something I would really love, but I think it will serve the same purpose for me as pacers... Good for a quick beer on my way to or from deagans, humble, or el carnicero."}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant experience here at Forage Public House. I went with my Mom when she was in town and both of us wanted to try something different and local. I had had this place on my bookmarks list for a long time and it felt like a good fit.

The restaurant is really pleasant and nicely decorated. The tables and booths are both very comfy (and are not torture like some place's seating). I really like the large windows that run down the entirety of one side of the place. It lets in a lot of natural light while letting people look out at the street which is fairly pleasant.

The service was great. The gentleman who was our waiter was funny, friendly and had a warm personalty which I really appreciated. The only downside was that he didn't really 'know' the menu. He had to go back to the kitchen to ask the chefs questions about the menu that I think any waiter who is familiar with the menu should already know. He could be new, but I doubt it. His attitude did make up for his lack of knowledge though--but I'm deducting half a star for the purposes of this review.

We also ordered a variety of foods from the menu including the stuffed eggs, rabbit loin, mushroom fettuccine and the key lime tart. The hands down winner of the evening was the key lime tart which might have possibly been one of the best I have ever had. They really put a surprising twist on it that I won't spoil here but I guarantee that it's yummy. 

The other half star that I'm deducting comes from the rabbit loin, which I ordered. The dish was very pretty and well composed but it was overcooked and the rabbit itself was salty. I ate about half of the rabbit and all of the additional stuff on my plate. 

Even so, I really do think this was a fluke and that this place is probably very nice. I would absolutely come back when I feel like shelling out for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Forage is more like 2.5 stars...

I agree with other reviewers that the music is too loud, the atmosphere too dark, and that it looks like a really super-cheap redo of the nastiness that was Pacers. All that could easily be overlooked if the food was stellar.

Service overall is great, we never had issues with long wait times or disrespectful workers.

HOWEVER, I have to seriously ding this place on the food. I ordered the amish country chicken. It comes with 4 (I think) pieces of chicken, some cut up sausage, fries and a salad on top. It's a very large plate of food. But, don't be fooled because it isn't all that tasty. 

The chicken was SO DRY I sopped up every bit of juice and dressing on the plate to try and make it palatable. My friend got the same dish and also said his was really dry too. The sausage on the plate was over-seasoned with herbs. The fries and salad were good though. The prices absolutely cannot justify the atmosphere, and more importantly, the food.

I won't be back, and if this place doesn't do an about face, I have a feeling they'll be gone in a few years."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first trip to Forage Public House! We went on a Tuesday evening, which I heartily recommend as their Taco Tuesday offerings are delicious and a great deal! The pork and fish tacos were the standouts of the evening.

That Tuesday evening was also a cold and drizzly day in March, which was a perfect kind of day to enjoy the fare at Forage, which is creative and tasty, but a tad on the heavy side. The menu is meat, french fry, and gravy driven, to be sure, but you can certainly cobble together a healthier meal if you so desire.

Bonus information: Seemingly every dish incorporates some (very tasty) french fries. You need not order a side of fries here - you will have enough!

Based on our experience, I'd want to give Forage a 3-3.5 star review, but I am tacking on an extra half star for the VAST improvement that this establishment represents over the defunct, funky Pacers! Good riddance! By contrast, Forage seems timely and relevant - a great addition to this area of Lakewood."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about Forage Public House. I had driven by it several times as a Lakewood resident and I finally got my butt in there. 

The ambiance is great, slightly classy, but you don't need to be decked to the 9s. We stopped by after an evening of bowling at Mahall's. It was too chilly to enjoy the patio, but the fireplace was a nice touch.

I love any place that has a bourbon menu. Not that I'm an expert, but I really enjoyed the drink I chose pretty much at random. I took Cleveland Magazine's recommendation and had the rabbit. It was delicious! I have never had rabbit before, so I wanted to give it whirl. It was sort of a cross between chicken and pork in my opinion. My boyfriend had a steak which he said was absolutely scrumptious. I was impressed by the bajillion different cheeses they offer to top your burger, each identified by its source.

The service was great to boot! I highly recommend this place for any foodies looking for someplace special to enjoy a locally-sourced meal."}
{"text":"I love when restaurants locally-source ingredients to support local economy and farmers, so I always want to give them a try.  I went with the supper club and a wide variety of entrees and appetizers were ordered.  Got to sample some of the other dishes:  deviled eggs (with mustard)  and poutine (fries with gravy and cheese curds) were both tasty indulgent foods.  I started with the beet, feta, pistachio appetizer.  Was so yummy, but  $13 was very steep for the portion. I had the trout for my entree, $17.  Would have loved to have had it with different sides though.  Did not love the very saucy orzo and the micro radish greens did not add anything to the dish.  Indulged on the Belgian chocolate creme brulee, $9 .  Hit of the night for me, velvety chocolate  topped with boozy cherries.  Others in the group seemed much happier with their appetizer and entree choices.  Most ordered sandwiches. I heard a comment from one of the group, saying it was one of the best hamburger they ever had.  Other hits were the pulled bbq pork sandwich on jalepeno cornbread and the banh mi sandwich.  I have a picture to load of my beet appetizer, but not sure how to do on the computer."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and good. You really feel like they care about using local ingredients and it shows in the fun dishes. 

I had the banh mi which was excellent. One in our party ordered French toast and I wanted to reach over and grab some it looked so scrumptious. She described it as breakfast, dessert and dinner all in one.  
Will definitely have to go back to try it. 

While this place serves up some excellent and innovative dishes, it lacks decor. I felt like I was sitting at Pacers minus the sports theme."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Forage and have been going there on a regular basis.  However I think I'm going to go elsewhere.  It's becoming a place to bring little kids.  And I don't get it.  I was there this evening and there were multiple tables of kids in high chairs crying and screaming. Who wants to be around that?  I have two adult kids and when they were small we stayed home, got a babysitter or took them to family restaurants.  I didn't think Forage was considered a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Kudos to the quinoa stuffed cabbage on Wednesday vegan night. Delicious! The burger was also done to perfection. For meat, it's a very good choice. They need a new bartender. The drinks were not memorable to ever order a second. And we had 4 different types of cocktails. I ordered a safe vodka and soda at the end. Very weak. Bummer.  My suggestion: Good for food, no go on drinks."}
