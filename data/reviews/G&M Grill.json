{"text":"This place is absolutley amazing! The food tastes delicious and the staff is really friendly. This is my new favorite place to stop and eat. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I found G&M Grill a few months back while picking up an Auction I won. It is right on the corner of the Business complex, you have to be blind to miss it. It all started with a breakfast burrito and then an Omelet on my second visit. It is my place to escape and relax, quiet atmosphere, friendly staff, it is, like I said \"my place\" to chill. Then I took my Wife there, She loved it after the first bite. Great portions of the freshest food that fill you up but not too full. I have been back a dozen times in the last couple of months. You won't regret trying this place out.Some of the tables are obscure from where the waitress is so, you might have to get up to ask for something. I haven't had to yet though She is very observant. I haven't tried the Greek food yet but, I will. Go there, order, eat, be happy, repeat often."}
{"text":"Great place! Pretty hidden but great food, GREAT staff! It's a repeat place for me! Large variety on menu also!"}
{"text":"Of course I stumbled across this place via Yelp, in my never ending search for great food on the west side. I drive around quite a bit in between patients and would not have seen this place otherwise. 
First of all the service, talk about hospitality...the owner overheard me asking for hot sauce for my steak Philly Gyro and offered the \"homemade\" salsa. He had the waitress pull out the good stuff! 
My steak Philly was delicious! I couldn't leave without trying an in house made Baklava. Now that is a treat and it's a perfect way to end my quick lunch!"}
{"text":"i walked in on friday @10am /JULY- 1ST -2016 /  empty restaurant. / they acted too busy to help me . as soon as i made contact with two ladies about getting a drink ... one walks away the other on the phone too busy \" sorry \" thats what i got / i had to go to mcdonalds because im on break, and these chicks are not going to help...  soo dissapointed. I THINK THEY HAD FRIENDLIER STAFF WHEN IT WAS CORPORATE CAFE."}
{"text":"What a great place!! I stopped by after work one day and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness of the food. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is extremely clean.  It is surrounded by large commercial businesses so mayo be slightly difficult to find. But on the flip side they do FREE delivery! This is definitely a \"hole in the wall\" that you must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times used to deliver I don't know if they still do the food is always been delicious it's always been on time they've always been extremely nice every time that we eating their I'll definitely referred to my friends and I will eat there again"}
