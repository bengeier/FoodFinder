{"text":"My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our anniversary and had a wonderful time! The staff was very friendly and helpful; we really enjoyed the wine our server recommended and Head Chef/Owner Eddie even came out to our table to check in with us. The food was delicious - a new twist incorporating seasonal flavors into our favorite Italian dishes. I really liked the way the vegetables were prepared with the chicken marsala. Eddie's mom makes all of the dessert pastries and we enjoyed some of the best tiramisu we have ever had. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Dined there last night with our daughter and we all shared ossobuco, chicken Marsala and spaghetti and everything was great.  House salads were good and server John was very attentive.  Tiramisu was best ever.  Only bad thing is a good thing as our daughter left her credit card so we will go back to pick it up today and enjoy happy hour at the bar."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Really, all of the courses were great.Homemade pastas, interesting sauces, delicious first courses and desserts. The only thing that needs work is service. They seemed a bit overwhelmed and a little understaffed. Still, I'd go back soon."}
{"text":"This little gem is worth a visit.  I have been to this location through several incarnations over the past 20 years, starting with the old Salvatores.  It is not easy to successfully run such a small place in a busy restaurant district -- with no parking.

One way to do it is to have a limited menu and execute really well.  The new owner did just that.  On the surface, the menu seems small and similar to anything you would expect to find in Little Italy.  We ordered the meatball app, the salmon special and the chicken marsala.  Each item was great.  I mean really good.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and the cannelini beans were more flavorful than I thought was possible .  I won't go into too much detail on the chicken marsala with the capers because I don't want to give it away.  Just get it and then you will get it.

As for the parking, its Little Italy not Olive Garden.  You go there because of the authentic neighborhood vibe not the striped asphalt parking lot next to Target."}
{"text":"We love every dishes that We ordered lamb meat ball, arancini, agnolotti, spaghetti with clam, grilled cod , fettuccini carbonara. Tiramisu,bombollini, and chocolate tart. 

Very tasty, beautiful presentation, good portion, reasonable price, cozy ambiance, good service, free valet parking. 

I will Definitely go back to try out the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Very very impressed. Their special was rack of lamb cooked rare to medium rare. We also had calamari and duck confit ravioli. I must say this ravioli was a delicacy. Dessert was topped off by homemade tiramisu and coffee ice cream. I asked where they got their tiramisu and their reply \"the chef's mother makes it.\" You mean an ole' school Italian bistro! Hell yes! This unassuming place is actually fantastic. The chef is passionate and enthusiastic. He visited our table to see how we were doing. So far this has only happened in Edwin's and here. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was mediocre. Server was not at all attentive to us. Never stopped by to check on us to see if everything was OK or if we needed anything. My husband never got the dessert he ordered. We had to ask someone else  for knives for our entrees. What should have been a special evening for us ended up being just \"OK\". We won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Traveling for business and first of many times I will be back. The Cavatelli with Lamb Ragu with mushrooms was outstanding and the donuts and lemon sorbet is as advertised. Eddie, the owner, is personable and is using fresh farm to table ingredients to make your experience one to remember."}
{"text":"We are here to visit CWRU and staying in walking distance from all the restaurants in Little Italy and just went in the first one we came to.  Excellent choice. My daughter had the duck ravioli with fiddleheads and mushrooms. I am on a detox and was worried what I could eat and the chef was very accommodating and prepared a beautiful piece of halibut lightly saut√©ed in olive oil and lemon all keeping within my dietary restrictions. Extremely friendly staff and wonderful service. We highly recommend this little gem."}
{"text":"Had a small group for my Bday- have had this place on my list for awhile and took advantage of the day!! Glad I did - Apps included the Arinchini and lamb meatballs- both extraordinary- dinners included the Fettuccine and the Spaghetti with clams & octopus - incredible- usually not a fan of fresh pasta - rarely done right- this was perfect - would return in an instant - very friendly staff & chef/owner- excellent meal"}
{"text":"This week we had the pleasure of dining at Nora in Little Italy for the first time to celebrate my mom's birthday. What a fabulous experience! From the moment we walked in, we were treated like family. For our meal, we began with the Salumi e Formaggi - chicken liver mousse, pork pate (perfection!), Fontina and Blue Cheeses, and house pickled vegetables paired with fantastic wines. The fresh out-of-the-oven bread, oh so good! Our main courses were scrumptious! I had the Spaghetti with middleneck clams, braised baby octopus, roasted garlic, chilies. The \"heat\" was just right balanced by the light cream sauce; the clams and baby octopus were fresh and tender. My fiance had the braised short ribs Ravioli with spinach, cauliflower, fingerling potatoes, horseradish crema which he described as succulent; the ingredients provided a fantastic balance of taste. My dad had the Chicken Marsala which was the best he has ever had (and he orders it at any restaurant where it is available!). The airline chicken breast, wild mushrooms and caper chicken thigh were so tasty. My mom had the Pappardelle beef and pork bolognese with San Marzano tomatoes, and breadcrumbs - savory and delicious! We thankfully saved room for their unforgettable desserts: Bombolini- homemade donuts, lemon gelato, macerated blueberries and Tiramasu with cinnamon gelato, chocolate-espresso crumble, and sweet cherry. Heavenly!!

Our server was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and respectful...he did not rush us through the celebratory meal. The owner/chef Eddie Zalar provided us a convenient parking spot since street parking was not available. He knew that walking in the rain was unsafe for my parents. This was our first visit and certainly was not the last!!! If you have not been to Nora, I highly recommend you pay Eddie a visit."}
{"text":"Giving this a 2 rating is generous.  We never received bread and asked for it twice.  Our server was rude.  My dirty martini had no dirt.  For the #3 rated restaurant in CLE, I would expect more.  I come to CLE monthly and can recommend restaurants:  maybe I can talk about to the owners.  They never told us about the specials and we had to ask.  And it was out of the way."}
{"text":"OMG! Stop what you are doing and go to Nora!! My husband and I were visiting from out of town and had an amazing dinner. Wonderful atmosphere (the playlist was awesome!), our waitress was fantastic and had great recommendations, and the food was INCREDIBLE!!! We were obsessed with every single dish. We got 2 apps (burrata is a MUST), salad, soup (OMG beet and apple... amazing!), 2 small pastas (the one with the strawberries was to die for) and tiramisu with coffee gelato (yes!) for dessert and it was perfect. We are huge foodies and recently moved from Chicago and now live in Pittsburgh (2 foodie cities) and this was one of the best meals we have ever had. The chef himself came out to say hi at the end of the meal.  Can't wait to go back on our next trip to Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely service. Charming spot. Food was only ok. Mushrooms that come with the chicken meatballs were especially good. Red sauce on pasta was mediocre. But, we would go back to try some more things."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for the patio but when we got there seemed frantic about not having a table inside. I then told them that our reservation was for the patio and was told that the patio is first come first serve. A little off putting.  Service was a bit slow and looked unorganized. I ordered a bottle of wine for the table and was not offered a taste before before getting poured for the table, nor was I even poured first. Not a big deal, but when you are paying a pretty penny, formalities matter. That being said, the food was on point. The tomato mozz appetizer had some of the best mozz I have ever tried. The Pastas were delicious and cooked perfectly. I would go back in a minute to sit inside and see if the services is and better."}
{"text":"Wow, very disappointing considering the great reviews on here and the recommendation from Eater. Pretty standard Italian in a \"nice\" but not formal atmosphere. I had the salad of the day which was a plate of very limp greens that should have been served colder and/or fresher than they were. Vinagrette was ok. For my main I had one of the many homemade pastas that sounded good. Maybe I just chose wrong. It was the pappardelle with tomato, mushrooms, and duck confit. I was not expecting a heavy tomato sauce, more of a light sauce marrying those flavors, especially since I don't associate duck confit with red sauce. But it came and had a very very heavy red sauce with chunks of duck and mushooms mixed in. The duck clearly wasn't cooked in the sauce; this wasn't a duck ragu which I think could have worked. Mushrooms were in fact large chunks of cremini or button mushrooms, which just seemed odd with the other ingredients. Friends had the rack of lamb and the carbonara pasta, and no one else was raving about theirs either. My dish also looked like it had been sitting a while by the time it finally came out. Also, while I don't think you MUST serve bread at an Italian place, at this type of Italian place I definitely expected it and was surprised when they didn't bring any. Overall, I think this place is overhyped and wouldn't return or recommend it."}
{"text":"I was dropped off by my hotel shuttle bus, which promptly left.  It was in the middle of a snow storm.  The front door was closed so I went around back to see if there was another entrance.  The chef was outside cleaning up and said they were closing early because of the snow storm and no one was in the restaurant.  Even though she was closing up she offered to cook me a dinner.  It was only her and I in the restaurant!  She cooked me the ravioli, it was her signature dish.  I had heard so much about it in the reviews that I had read and was looking forward to tasting it.  It was amazing!  Such a different taste.  I would recommend this place and will come back when I'm in town. So grateful to be able to have dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Probably some of the best Italian food in NEO.  The recipes are unique and the ingredients are fresh. This was one of the closest restaurants to actually eating in Italy in the area.  They have fresh pasta and it is very good.  My wife got the ravioli and I got the carbonara and both were great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here on a Saturday night.  We were cordially greeted upon arrival and given a nice table by the window.  Our server John was knowledgeable and he took good care of us.  We shared the Burata and house salad as appetizers.  The Burata was rich and delicious, served with a homemade olive tapanade and garnished with house pickled baby heirloom tomatoes.  The house salad was fresh and crisp, featuring a mix of baby lettuces and accented with crisp pickled carrot.  For our entres, we had the veal osso bucco and the rack of lamb, both of which were of very high quality, prepared to our specifications, and accompanied by fresh and inspired side dishes.  We enjoyed a bottle of Piedmont wine, and topped things off with a homemade tiramisu by the chef's mother who was the restaurant's pastry chef.  
This restaurant is recently opened by the chef owner Eddie who was trained at the Culinary Institute of America and worked in several top New York City restaurants prior to opening this one."}
{"text":"The dinner was wonderful. We had Agnolotti with squash, ricotta, fennel.
Seafood misto bruchetta. They also have Slovenian wine. We also had espresso rubbed lamb with spinach and gnocchi in mushroom reduction. Chicken confit with Asiago and blood orange. So yummy. It's a bit loud and was crowded bar. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Loved the bar and the small, intimate dining experience.  Service was very attentive.  Menu is small and edited which we loved.  The lamb meatballs, Fettuccine and steak special were all delicious. I never thought I woud eat a pasta that rivals Dante but damn Gina, that fettuccine is on point.    Chocolate torte with Grand Marnier was soooo good.  Older crowd that likes to dress up and we loved that.  So why 4 stars and not 5?  1) It would have been nice to have someone offer to take our coats upon walking in the front door.  2) I thought the food could have been served a little bit hotter.  Other than these points, the flavors are there, perfectly conceptualized.  My husband says it is his new favorite place.  We went back since and had the Agnolotti, the burrata, and the Arancini.  The burrata was a little too cold but the accompanying jam and rapini were killer good. The agnolotti butternut squash filling was a little too sweet for me.  But holy smokes, you can never deny that the flavors are unique and they totally work together which we LOVE about this place. And the tiramisu with the cinnamon gelato over crushed coffee beans...you know where I am going with this...deliciously great."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in a long time. Nice modest portions, beautifully plated. Inventive ingredients that evidently fresh fresh free. Generous happy hour but only at the bar. Excellent service and complimentary valet. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very unique combinations of flavors that you can't get anywhere else. The staff are very nice and helpful and they do anything to make it a positive experience. Favorite place in the little Italy area and all of cleveland!"}
{"text":"Nora has absolutely delicious flavors made with all the freshest local ingredients. From the fresh bread and chive butter to the calamari and salad as starters, everything about the presentation and  flavor was great. The gnocchi was delicious with amazing mushrooms and butternut squash. Steak was cooked perfectly. The ravioli has a wonderful fresh vegetable flavors and a fresh sauce. This is not your typical Italian chicken parm loaded with sauce and pasta place, but a more carefully crafted menu focused on freshness and flavors. Tiramisu for desert was also great. Also the ambiance and service was comfortable and pleasant. I will definitely return for the seasonal menu changes."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, thanks to a great owner/chef. Great atmosphere with an excellent menu. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"The setting was nice. Definitely more of a romantic kind of ambience. For the most part, the food was palatable. It's unfortunate you often remember what you did not care for, and so was the case for us. The lamb meatball appetizer was blas√© (more specifically a tad too game-y) and the liver appetizer was unexpectedly chunky and therefore not desirable to neither my wife or I. Now that we know, we'd surely order something different. Doesn't mean we would go back. Hope this helps, cheers!"}
{"text":"Only good things to say about Nora. We made a reservation here before seeing the Cleveland Orchestra. Our service was excellent."}
{"text":"We were back again a few days ago.  Everything was still scrumptious. Delightful service and small quaint setting.  Keep on keeping on!"}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple went here for dinner Sunday Feb 12, 2017.  The food was fantastic!  We decided to order appetizer sized portions of the pastas and a few true appetizers so we had a chance to sample much of the menu.  
The pappardelle was terrific.  It was made with duck and the thick pappardelle pasta.  It was infused with an orange sauce which gave it a fastastic flavor.  The Spaghetti with clams had several delicious clams over spaghetti with clam sauce.  Again very flavorful.  The Agnolotti was wonderful.  There was a sweet butternut squash filling in a sauce which complemented it well.  We had ravioli with fennel sausage filling.  This was the favorite of both my wife and I.  We also had the fettuccini, again very flavorful.  We also had the calamari which was excellent, the lamb meatballs and salad.

What we really enjoyed about this dining experience was that while it was clearly Italian, there were many dishes with unique flavors which differed from typical dishes such as parmigiana or piccata.  So we felt we had a savory and unique dining experience!  

Of course, the dining atmosphere was upscale.  There was optional valet parking, which is nice in winter in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We saw the rave reviews and had to try it out.  I have to say, with all the hype, I was a bit disappointed.  Service was pretty good. Our waiter was just the right amount of attentive. But overall, our dinners were just above average.  I think this location is just doomed to fail, so far off the beaten path.  Really cool building, but I just don't think it can survive.  Very small and intimate, but so was Il Bacio when it was here.  We'll probably give this place another shot soon, when (and if) the weather improves here in C-town.  Snow in April.  Really?"}
{"text":"My mother recently has become very ill- my family is not from Cleveland, we have been sleeping in a hotel or at her bedside in the hospital now for 3 weeks. We haven't had time to cook or sit down in a restaurant for awhile. 

My Aunts who live out of state came in and we stepped out to run errands and hit the grocery. A wrong turn took us to Little Italy and by chance my Aunt kept repeating Nora due to the reviews on Yelp. 

There arent words to describe how phenomenal the food, wine, service, and experience was. But most importantly I had the pleasure meeting the owners and I assure you- this place will not disappoint. I'm not sure when but I know I will be back and will forever recommend this place. 

Thank you for such a wonderful afternoon. It was incredible to have a sense of normalcy even if it was brief. We appreciate you."}
{"text":"I shared an amazing meal with my family on Saturday evening at Nora. We called ahead to see if it was ok to bring our little one, which is typically really stressful, but we are so glad that we did. 

It felt like a big night out being at such a nice restaurant (which is all relative when you're used to eating cereal in yoga pants), so I got the St. Germain cocktail, which was sweet and bubbly - just what I was looking for. 

We got the calamari and the burrata for appetizers, and they were both excellent. The burrata was large enough to share and came with crostini and an olive and caper tapenade (sp?), which was just the right amount of saltiness for such a creamy cheese. I would order that with a salad for dinner any day. The calamari were lightly-battered and crispy. Perfect. 

For my entree I ordered the fettuccini, which was prepared with a carbonara sauce. It was such a wonderful combination of texture and had layers of flavor that kept the dish interesting in a way that most pasta dishes (for me) can't do. I can see why it was recognized as one of the 50 best dishes. 

At this point, our little guy was starting to beg for bed time, but I couldn't leave without trying the bambolini (sp?). His cuteness had long worn off, so I scrambled to eat my light, fluffy doughnut-style treat with the accompanying lemon sauce and ice cream/gelato/sorbet. Though rushed, it was fantastic. 

I'll be back. Sans baby."}
{"text":"This is a secret of Little Italy. To me, this is by far the best and most delicious restaurant in the area. It is small but nice. They also have happy hour which they give 20% off....good deal!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I waited so long to try this place out. Everything we had was delicious and on point: calamari, chicken entree, and carbonara and we finished off with the doughnut dish with the lemon gelato. Food came in a timely fashion and the service was polite and super helpful. The bread was fresh & delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The cuisine at Nora is really quite good. C had Fettuccini with roasted garlic-pancetta carbonara, poached egg, cured yolk, matchstick potatoes. I ordered the Pappardelle with lamb ragu, minted ricotta, bone marrow breadcrumbs. Both dishes were divine, washed down with a nice red. This was followed by Bombolini )homemade donuts, lemon gelato, macerated blueberries), which was very good. The ambiance is very nice; nearly romantic ... especially because they had a guitatist playing soft jazz. Service could have been better, but we very much enjoyed our time at Nora. 

Food: 4 stars
Service: 3 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars+ (and thank you (!) for not having a TV at the bar)

The bad:

- Parking is impossible in this neighborhood. We pulled up to the valet spot in front, but no valet emerged, so we drove up and down the streets, but it's resident parking only everywhere. We returned to the restaurant to ask about the valet. The server informed C that they don't have valet on Thursdays (Grrr). No wonder the place was nearly empty. Fortunately, she told us to simply park in the valet parking area. Appreciated and free, but it sure would have been nice to know it before we arrived and wasted 15 minutes trying to park, especially since I had called to make a reservation.

- The hostess/server/bartender/busser needs a wee bit of training. After we arrived, we sat for about 10 minutes (without menus) while the she attended an adjacent table and prepared a martini. (Yes, one person to perform every function; weird). I ask about one of the wines offered but ordered a different bottle. When she arrived with it, she essentially ignored me, although I was the one who ordered the wine. She ceremoniously displayed the label to my wife, but not to me, although I ordered the wine. Then she poured a tasting into my wife's glass, without asking whether I wanted to sample the wine . . . that I had ordered. My wife indicated that it was fine. The server poured an generous amount into my wife glass and finally turned to me and asked if I would be having wine too. Grrr. This is not how it's done. Training needed.

I hate to continue harping about the service, but there were additional blunders. We were talking, drinking our wine and slowly persuing the menu. The server kept returning, often, to ask if we were ready to order, in spite of the fact that our menus were open; we were reading them; and, not much time had passed, making us feel unnecessarily rushed. After a few minutes we made our decision and closed our menus. Rather than taking our order, she took time to buss a nearby table, including stripping it bare, unfurling a fresh tablecloth and setting out all the dinnerware, glasses and napkins (about 10 minutes), before returning to take our order. When we asked what cured yolk is (an ingredient in one of the menu items), she responded nonesensically that \"it's just cured in the kitchen.\" When we pressed for a better explanation, it became evident that she had no idea. But rather than saying, let me find out, she gave an answer that was not an answer at all, she told us something that made no sense. I checked on the internet and learned about cured yolks, but it was nothing like she described.

- Above, I mentioned that the ambiance was \"nearly romantic.\" And I must say that it's really close. The un-romantic aspect was the bar. The hostess/server/bartender/busser made some incredible noise behind the bar several times, seemingly throwing empty bottles into a trash can (or something like that). Everyone in the restaurant jumped at the loud crashes. She needs to recognise that this is a quiet restaurant; not a brew pub. Other than that, the place is beautiful and intimate. And the cuisine quite excellent. We would return."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about the experience at Nora is that the service is excellent. Really enjoyed the relaxing, romantic atmosphere to celebrate my husband's birthday. 

We arrived almost an hour before our reservation, so we decided to have a happy hour drink at the bar first. We also ordered the calamari appetizer. Happy hour starts at 5pm when they open and goes to 7pm, the deal is 20% off whatever you order as long as you're sitting at the bar.  

We then moved to a table by the window for dinner. I ordered spaghetti, he ordered ravioli. The duck ravioli was wonderful. Very flavorful and plenty of duck in the ravioli and on the top. I didn't care for my spaghetti dish as I thought it was very dry. The noodles were good and homemade, and the creamy sauce was delicious but i would have enjoyed more of it. I did not ask because I did not want to offend the chef if this is the way the pasta is supposed to be eaten. I rarely eat real Italian food so I do not know.  It was spiced with some red pepper flakes and the clams were plentiful. Baby octopus was also good. 
One thing that I found a little disappointing was the bread and butter brought to the table. I was hoping for the typical italian bread with olive oil and herbs or balsamic to dip in. I love that. But here they just give you bread and basil butter. It was alright, but we each only got 1 small piece.  

I am not taking this into account for my review, but the parking situation in Little Italy is a nightmare. A nightmare. Nora does offer free valet parking on Friday and Saturday but unfortunately we came in during the week and drove around for a half an hour before deciding we would have to park up the hill closer to Kenilworth road, about a half mile walk back to the restaurant. It was a nice day and we had some time to kill, but I would highly suggest taking Uber or a bus or anything but driving and trying to find parking on your own. Or go on a weekend and take advantage of the valet!

One last thing to note is that I learned of this place through restaurant.com and bought the $25 gift certificate before we came. I am always hesitant about those coupons because a lot of places give you a hard time but at Nora they accepted it with no problems."}
{"text":"It was nice to go somewhere on Murray Hill that was more than just traditional pasta, yet still felt extremely traditional, warm, and hearty.  Nora was much smaller than I expected, but big things come out of their kitchen. 

First of all, the wine selection is insane. Great bottle choices from grapes that aren't typically highligted in most restaurants.  And don't discount all of the calamari mentions in reviews: it truly is some if the best in Cleveland. It's light, flavorful, and of perfect texture. 

I had the osso bucco, which was plate-licking-in-public level delicious. In general, there was a ton of care and detail in every step of our meal. Absolutely worth a visit and a place not to miss!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone thru a lot of owners/name changes/chefs.   Well, finally, we have the right chef/owner for this establishment.   Chef Eddie cut his teeth in the shark infested waters of the NYC dinner scene.  The cooking and menu are simple but NYC quality.   Pasta is fresh and nice mix of creations.  Good wine list.  Try the Super Tuscan's.  The Burrata is a good start, as is the soup.  Been here twice already, and the chilled soups were both winners.  Between Micheangleo, Eatna,  L'Albatross, this area is really coming into it's own.  Nora is a nice addition to this lineup."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Nora last night! The salmon I had was the best I've ever tasted. The linguini and clams was also excellent. The Chardonnay we had from Abruzzo was the perfect compliment to the dinners. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service a little slow to start, but they spaced out the courses perfectly.   Fantastic wine - we will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is very pleasant, and the food is absoultely amazing not to mention the food arrived fast as well.I will be returning very soon. I reccommend the carbonara  its out of this world good! You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Nora exceeded our expectations. The service was fantastic, and the food was impressive. This small eatery is classy and cozy in the heart of Little Italy. We started with the smoked mussel / octopus bruschetta, which was so tasty. Next, the salad with candied walnuts and cranberries - very nice. The wine list was good, we ordered a bottle of Montepulciano D'Abruzzo. We loved the pasta. It was the best fresh pasta we've had in a long time. I had the duck confit pappardelle, and my husband had the roasted garlic, poached egg, pancetta carbonara linguine. We ordered full orders, and ate every bite. For dessert, tira misu. It was heavenly. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good drink selection, nicely decorated dining room, valet parking

 limited menu, like a lot of upscale restaurants - the portions are somewhat small for the price."}
{"text":"Very sweet romantic little corner restaurant with excellent service, food & ambiance. Would highly recommend for a nice romantic date or to have a quiet dinner with a friend with beautiful ambiance. We had a steak and fish and they were prepared deliciously and fresh. Prices were very good for such a high quality meal. The restaurant accommodates about 25-30 seated plus there is a small bar. This place could easily be rented out for an intimate gathering as well."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour--half priced apps. The arancini is great! Haven't tried actual dinner there yet."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Seattle and decided at last minute to eat in Little Italy area.  The first choice was taken and when I called and talked to owner, Eddy, and he said they were full but had room for us (4) at the bar. Upon arrival we found the place small, but the ambience was great.  Our waitress was Lisa, who assisted in our choices.  
We had the soup, creamy type, but forgot the name but was very good.  I had the swordfish which was very good, but had way to many beans on the side. My wife had the ravioli with beef, which was amazing.  The true test was our daughter in law had plain spaghetti and she loved it!  
Great place with amazing food, but definitely get reservations in advance. We were just lucky getting in on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Started with the arancini and burratta. The burrata was incredible and will be my go to app.  The pastas were all delicious and beautiful.  I loved the fettuccini.  If you sit at the bar during happy hour, your entire meal will be 20 perc off.  Everything tasted fresh and innovative and I am already looking forward to my next visit.  They also had live music.  Perfect date restaurant.  Make reservations since there's only seating for 20."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not a true authentic Italian experience. Service was subpar as we were asked three times prior to being seated if we had a reservation by three separate employees only to be left at the bar. Noodles were good. We needed to ask for bread."}
{"text":"Amazing chef power! Simply a divine and sublime experience was had here recently on a Saturday evening. The patio is small and sun drenched in the early evening, but that was all they had available until after 9 PM. Superb service and the recommendation for a vegetarian entree of Agnolotti. Not what my wife would have normally chosen among the options, but was clearly a grand choice. From the du jour cauliflower soup to a Burrata appetizer and then the amazingly prepared Chicken Saltimbocca, it would have been enough to easily earn them 5 stars. Dessert of Tiramisu did not disappoint. Worth driving up the hill and checking in to this cool spot for the experience. Hitting high on the list of great gastronomic adventures to be had in the CLE."}
{"text":"What an excellent restaurant! From appetizers to the main course to the dessert, it was absolutely fabulous.  Chef/owner Eddie came out to each table to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal.  We will definitely be returning to Nora. So many great looking things to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive. The atmosphere was like a seen from the Sopranos which made for great people watching.  Additionally, it's always great when a restaurant has live entertainment. Unfortunately the food was terrible. I literally ate an old shoe for dinner. The prosciutto tasted like a shoe tongue. The pasta tasted like shoelaces. The mozzarella tasted like a rubber soul. I'm grateful for Prilosec OTC."}
{"text":"Nora was simply mind blowing. The atmosphere, the food, the wine, the service!!! Everything was 5 star quality. I had the fettuccini carbonara with potato match sticks and a poached egg. I ordered the half portion and that was the biggest mistake of my life. I finished it within minutes and desperately wanted more. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Ugh. Disappointed is the only way to describe my experience. First of all, my husband made reservations at Nora to spend my bday. The restaurant TEXTED my husband, asked if I liked prosecco, and told him they would like to give me a glass on the house for celebrating my bday with them. Well... they didn't follow through. No prosecco was ever offered to me!! If they wouldn't have explicitly said that, I would have never expected anything. 

Our meal was $120 pre tax... no dessert. I expected better, especially for a place I was celebrating my birthday dinner. Nora was a major let down. I ordered the chicken eggplant Parmesan dish. It was full of some weird mozzarella cream sauce, a small chicken leg... and some sushi looking dark meat chicken rolls with mozzarella inside? Honestly the weirdest dish I've ever seen. My husband had the ravioli and was also underwhelmed. Yelp... you let me down on this one!!! Maybe under different circumstances I would have rated this place differently... but 2 stars is generous."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and it surely paid off. Nora is quite intimate and the staff amazingly friendly. 
I had a duck confit stuffed ravioli that wasn't heavy. Followed that up with a chocolate tart and coffee ice cream that was simply heavenly. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the fresh swordfish was cooked perfectly. The Pinot Grigio was perfect with the entree. Very quaint little spot. I will go again when I am in town."}
{"text":"Was in town for two days and stumbled upon this little spot. By far the best part of the trip. Amazing homemade pasta and deadly good desserts. Ate here both nights."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Italian food. Calamari for appetizer was fresh. The fettuccine and scallops for dinner was amazing. And Best tiramisu ever."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for ten years. Finally made it happen. My entire life has been neglected. The food is amazing, the service is the best I've experienced by leaps and bounds, and the menu changes regularly-- the chef is excellent. Portions are appropriate. Prices are a bit high, but the value is no question in terms of the cost relative to the quality of the food, ambiance, and service. Parking, as this is in the Little Italy neighborhood, is challenging."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 5:15 PM which is right after they open, so there was only two other couples. However, the restaurant did fill up more as time went by and when we left it was crowded. Even as the restaurant filled up, our waitress was very attentive and our water glasses were always full. I would say they have a pretty good wine list, but I am by no means a wine enthusiast. I also did have a dirty martini and I felt it was made perfectly. Not too much olive brine! The interior of the restaurant was nice and my wife commented many times how much she liked it. It is a smaller, quaint restaurant which definitely added some charm to the place. My wife got the salad special to start, and it was an interesting combination. Typical salad greens but it also came with a butternut squash pur√©e under the salad that added some sweetness to the vinegar that was in the salad dressing. Different take on a salad that I have never had before, and perfectly executed. I had the soup of the night, which was a seafood soup with clams, mussels, I believe some type of fish, and garbanzo beans. Once again, this was perfect! For the main course my wife got the ravioli and I had the ravioli. The waitress told us that these are the two best dishes. The ravioli has a date filling and they are topped with beef short ribs. My wife loved this dish! I thought it was an interesting take with the sweet date filling and the beef on the outside, but once again excellent. As for the rigatoni, it comes with a lamb and pork bolognese and is topped with crispy prosciutto.  I have had a lot of bolognese, but this was definitely my favorite that I have ever had. The crispy prosciutto also added a nice crunch texture to the pasta. Overall, this meal was excellent and my wife and I both agreed we will come back here many times!

P.s. There is valet parking!"}
{"text":"It was pretty okay. Service was very nice. The food wasn't awful, just not incredible. The reason I'm rating it two stars is because if you're looking for good Italian food in Cleveland in that price range with that kind of modern Italian atmosphere, there are so many other options: Dantes, Luca, etc. It's like spending so much money at Cheesecake Factory. It's decent, but why not go to some place that will make you feel like you rightfully spent fifty dollars on amazing food."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy superb food. The menu is small but diverse.
Service delightful.
Worth hunting for parking space!"}
{"text":"A generous two rating.  When we arrived we were asked to be seated at two top in a dungeon corner
even though there were many tables open.  We were reseated after requesting a move.
The food- no bread offered or delivered.  Have you ever been to an Italian restaurant and not been given bread.  My carbonara pasta had no flavor and was the consistency of wallpaper paste.  
We just returned from two weeks in Italy and we never saw such an odd menu and poor food across the pond.  Way over rated."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance with solid service. Was a little concerned what to expect since I was able to get a table on a Friday night at a late hour. I shouldn't have worried. Started the evening with a great happy hour followed by a great dinner. The PAPPARDELLE BOLOGNESE was a home run. All four of us loved our meals. Meatballs were best app. Desserts solid too! The guitarist was a nice touch too. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband almost licked his plate.  We had the ravioli, meatballs, and calamari.  All were delicious.  We sat at the bar without a reservation.  Be sure to make one if you can.  Small and cozy, and great food and service. They have $5 happy hour EVERY DAY from 5-8, $5 wines and apps...and they were nice portions as well as good wines!  Off the main strip in little Italy.  We will go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because it was listed on Restaurant.com and I have had certificates burning a hole in my pocket for literally 3 years. The Restaurant.com deal was $25 off $50. I was excited to try something else in Little Italy as previously I have been pretty staunch on only liking Mia Bella & Washington Inn & Bistro, the latter of which isn't really Italian. 

I made a reservation via Nora's website which just entails filling out an online form. I got an email reply back by the next morning confirming the reservation from Eddie.

With no valet on Thursdays (only present [and complimentary] Fri and Sat) parking is pretty much nonexistent. I recommend the Cornell hill. The interior of the space is pretty charming. It is warmly decorated and small in size both of which contribute to a cozy dining room.  

Il Bacio is the name of the restaurant that previously occupied this address. By reading the last few reviews of that place, I was slightly nervous about how Nora's food would be as there seemed to be some trouble transitioning from one restaurant to the other. 

**No fear though, Nora is good!!** I love soups, and it just so happened that one of the specials the night i went was a Sweet Potato Soup ($7)! It was a big deep bowl and an amazing way to start my meal and a true flashback to fall when one usually finds these types of puree soups. There was a slightly spicy oil drizzled on top the soup - superb! They always have a soup of the day so check back frequently! If I lived nearby this would be a weekly takeout thing for me! The salad my friend got was of a good portion size. 

For my main I ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese ($21). There was a San Marzano tomato based meat sauce was heavily filled with a beef and pork ragu. While it was a tomato based sauce, it was very thick, and when having eaten the entire entree, there was no sauce worth mentioning left on the plate. The pasta noodles we were told, in all the dishes, are made in house! The menu also mentioned a savory breadcrumb component to the dish. I definitely noticed this sprinkled on top and sticking mostly to the noodles. It certainly was flavorful, if perhaps a bit too salty, but it provided a nice light crunch now and again and added a texture to the dish. The presentation of this dish was great too. Everything was neatly coiled together when it was served to me. 

Desserts were we told are also all made in house, but unfortunately we were too full to sample. The waiter recommended the tiramisu. After paying we were offered free Lemoncello.

Overall I really liked this place. The server was really nice. When we first arrived he asked if we were in a hurry if we were going to a play or something after dinner."}
{"text":"This place was really nice.  Very quaint, small restaurant but with a great atmosphere.   We were there on a week night and the only complaint I had was finding parking.  

The Burratta was delicious, as was the various pastas we tried ( Pappardelle Bolognese and fettuccini)  I had the sea scallop special and it was phenomenal.  Great staff and service too.  We were given great feedback on the menu and recommendations.  

Overall a solid choice for a date night out with someone special."}
{"text":"Great flavors for a nice romantic Italian dinner every now and then! We have been here 4 times so far exploring the menu"}
{"text":"I have been to Nora twice now and both times I was immensely impressed. The first time, mom and I went almost by accident because we were in the area and had wanted to try it for a little while. Eddie, the owner, actual led pulled his car forward so we could park behind him since we were the first reservations of the night! Now that's service! Speaking of service, our waiter was AWESOME! He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food came out simple, deep and complex flavours, and beautifully plated. The highlight of that evening was the tiramisu and complimentary glass of sangue di giuda. I was so in love with this little gem, I took my boyfriend for his birthday. We went when they opened and enjoyed a quiet hour by ourselves before the restaurant filled. I had the same waiter, who remembered me from the month before, and the service was tight! The food, again, amazed and left us all but silent through the meal save groans of appreciation. And of course I ended my meal with the homemade tiramisu. My boyfriend got the bread pudding and loved it as well! I can't WAIT for my next meal at Nora (already being planned with my financial advisors)!"}
{"text":"Went here after purchasing a gift certificate off of restaurant.com. 

When we walked in around 8:45 the place was mostly empty which had me worried at first.

We sat down and ordered our drinks. They have a very nice wine selection, however I am not much of a wine drinker so I went with a Bombay and soda. After the drinks, they brought out warm bread with basil butter which was very good.

Next came time to order. We got the calamari fritti. The Agnolotti with sweet potato puree, wild mushrooms, roasted beets, and brown butter. The fettuccine with roasted garlic-pancetta carbonara, poached egg, cured yolk, and matchstick potatoes. And a beef tenderloin special that came with spinach and deep fried chicken livers. 

First the calamari. This was the only dish I was disappointed with. It came out half cold and there was very little calamari for the price and the fact that it was clearly frozen and pre breaded. I would not recommend this dish.

However after this disappointment, the entrees were all pleasant surprises. The egg yolk in the fettuccine was an awesome touch along with the potatoes and crispy, salty bits of pancetta. The tenderloin was exquisitely tender and the fried chicken livers were another pleasant suprise. And finally the Agnolotti was beautiful and tender with a creamy, smooth sweet potatoe filling.

Overall I give this place 4 stars. The food was good..not mind blowing but very good. Also the service was a little off at times however this place is new and our server was very nice and well intentioned so he gets a pass."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Nora while on a visit to Cleveland. I couldn't have been more impressed with the attention to detail. We had the bone marrow appetizer and meatballs both of which were excellent. Both the parpadelle bolagnese and veal were delicious and the service was top notch. Will definitely return!"}
