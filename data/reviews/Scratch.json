{"text":"An oasis in a desert for breakfast places. I've lived around here since 1989 and have been amazed at the lack of a good diner or breakfast place. This place is homey like a diner, but eclectic with cool music... and outstanding food. The Corned Beef \"don't call it\" Hash is melt in your mouth amazing. This is my new go to place for breakfast out. I'm sure lunch is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"We caught the reviews for Scratch while looking for a place for dinner and decided to go for breakfast. We are glad we did. Someone who cares about good food is running a clean  place with great food.  Good coffee and friendly but not overbearing service is a good way to start a Saturday morning.  The 'puddin' french toast is dense, moist and flavorful with tangy blueberry compote and homemade whipped cream. The sausage looks hand pattied and homemade.  Good luck to this hard working team. We think you have a winner."}
{"text":"Scratch is wonderful!  I've been here twice and everything is delicious!  Best home fries ever!  And the lunch salads wonderful!  Will be back again and again . . ."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just happened upon this place this afternoon, and am more than a little bit surprised at what a great experience we had here today.  The ambiance is brilliant--very open and minimalist, with music at a pleasant, unobtrusive volume.  The weather today was gorgeous, and they had the door open to allow in the cool breeze.  At least three waitstaff approached my girlfriend and I, checking in with us regarding what we would like off of the menu.  We ordered two sandwiches, the Salmon on the baguette (delicious homemade, flaky bread!) and the Seared Tuna and Avocado on the Ezekiel bread; both came with side salads.  The sandwiches were delicious, albeit the Salmon was light on the actual salmon, which I was a bit disappointed by.  In all, though, the ingredients were fresh and not too heavy. I got a refreshing iced coffee for $2.50 with free(!) refills. 
      A man who I believe to be the owner hung out with us and talked to us about his time in France, and gave us some madeleines on the house, which are made fresh here--they were delicious...a hint of lemon or citrus zest!  He also encouraged us to try the Lucky Buddah beer, infused with essence of violet and light blackberry flavoring--it was awesome! The additives did not sweeten the beer, merely augmented it.  Finally, as we transitioned into some Sunday work on the wifi, we tried some of the pastries for dessert....I had the hazlenut/milk chocolate/ganache dome pastry, and my girlfriend had the blackberry tart with a rum base.  Utterly delicious--the dome tastes like a larger, lighter version of a Ferrero Roche.  To top it all off, contrary to their website's posted hours, they are open until 10 pm on a Sunday!!  AWESOME.
     Suffice it to say we had a beautiful, romantic Sunday afternoon and evening here, absolutely enhanced by the attentive and congenial staff. I've seen some comments about previous experiences from others who have visited Scratch that mentioned a \"chaotic,\" or \"disorganized,\" staff--I do notice that they are less conventional in that so many waitstaff approached our table to check on us, which I find to be different from what I am used to, but pleasant nevertheless!  To me it shows that they are collectively invested in ensuring that their customers are being attended to.  I am so excited to see Scratch as an addition to the Downtown Phoenix restaurant and bar scene; definitely one of my favorites thus far!!"}
{"text":"Scratch is still very new, so I'm looking forward to a lot of changes for the better.  They've got a great location, and the owner seems to have the enthusiasm for success.

Our first attempt at scratch was kind of a disaster.  We had quite a large group and were there within their first month open, so it was almost to be expected.  However we were assured they could handle our group so we gave it a shot.  The service was slow at best.  Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a large table and made it a point to tell us that many, many times.  She made us feel like a burden, but reminded us that she had 20 years experience (so I'm not sure what the problem was).  We were later visited by the owner, and I believe some friends who didn't even work there who he called in to help - bonus points.  Still, after being told we couldn't order anything beside basic drinks (because the bartender \"probably won't know how to make them), we waited forever for water, beer, and eventually food.  I can't vouch for anyone else because frankly I wasn't paying attention, but my veggie burger seemed like something from the Sysco truck.  Not impressed.

Try #2: Brunch.  Service was still slow and confused, but much better.  The Eggs Royale were commendable - their salmon has a uniquely mild and delicious flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  I was looking forward to trying one of their pastries, but was disappointed with the selection.  The pastry case looked bored.  With only about 3 different choices, the pastries looked good but unimpressive for bakery standards.  They had a selection of macaroons, which although likely fresh, seemed a bit pricey at $3.75 each.  I ended up skipping the pastries.

Lastly, and most notably, the place lacks personality.  There's something about the newly renovated complex Scratch lives in that makes it a fun place to go, but the atmosphere ends at the gate."}
{"text":"Great location, great atmosphere, great patio. I had a goat cheese and mushroom crepe- it was delicious and the coffee was great too. The service was seriously lacking though- the waitress was crazy flustered, it's coffee and crepes... Calm down. The coffee bar gal ended up serving us and though she was better, we had to ask for all of the items we ordered, coffee refills, etc. It's newly opened so I am hoping to revise this review after they get it together."}
{"text":"Patio, Patio, Patio!  

Spring time is a wonderful time to eat outside and this renovated building is definitely a new draw on Roosevelt Row in the Evans Churchill neighborhood.  The outdoor patio is shooting for French Quarter in the middle of the southwest.  It is adjacent to two other restaurants opening up soon.  There were an abundance of people rolling up to take advantage of all the bicycle parking. (***Main parking is accessed off the alley, which runs east-west between 3rd St and 5th St***)

The interior is very contemporary with an open kitchen concept and clean lines.  There is a cozy bar along the west wall with plenty of local on tap.  There will also be a walk-up baked goods counter and I'm told there will be ice cream!

Given the vogue of many restaurants recently...they went with a soft opening and still seem to be working out the kinks.  The staff is still learning their sections and the intricacies of the menu.

As for the  food, it's a solid 3.5 stars, went with the Lamb Burger which was well seasoned, topped with fresh mint leaves on their own freshly baked bun...this come standard with a mixed greens side salad.  Also tried the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich that was well seasoned on two grilled pieces of bread, with sliced cucumber and avocado.

It's a balanced price point of $8-10/sandwich with a great outside ambiance.  The menu has a wide variety to choose from breakfast, sandwiches, and soon to be great pastries.

A slow opening would not stop me from going back given all the great reviews of the original location.  I'm sure management will dot the I's and cross the T's soon enough.

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times now; three times for lunch and once for drinks and dessert.  First, the service is a bit hit or miss.  I've had a couple of really attentive servers, and one who was just awful.  Patio service has been less consistent than the times I've dined inside.  That said, it's still a new place, and I'm hoping they're working out staffing kinks.

The food has not disappointed.  I've had the seared tuna sandwich, the croque monsieur (with egg) and the Angus burger with mozzarella.  Of the three, the tuna sandwich was my favorite.  The tuna was delicately seasoned, and paired well with the pesto and cucumber.  The burger was delicious.  The croque monsieur was decent, but nothing to write home about.  Also, the egg was not cooked through, so the white was runny, which I hate.  With the exception of the lunch I had on the patio (which had terrible service), I was in and out in under an hour. 

I went there with friends on a Friday night for drinks and dessert.  We didn't realize the restaurant had a dessert tray of the pastries being sold next door, so we ordered pastries at the pastry shop, and took them to the patio to sit and order drinks.  The pastries were all very good, but very sweet.  There were four pastries being shared by six people, and we had a very hard time finishing any of them.  As if we didn't have enough sugar on the table, the owner brought over two creme brulees, which were really good.  Of all of the sweets on the table, the creme brulees disappeared the fastest.  They were regular creme brulees, but the owner said that he planned to change the flavor each week, with orange and earl grey coming in the next two weeks.  The organic wine we ordered was not great, but they did have some decent bottle offerings, we just chose incorrectly.  They have a pretty solid draft beer menu.

Overall, I really like this place, and am eager to go back for brunch.  The food has been consistently good, and I think as they get a bit more into the swing of things, the servers will get better and the kitchen a bit faster.  It's nice to have something happening on that corner, and I like that they're open late enough than you can swing by for a quick bite or dessert after an earlier event."}
{"text":"One of the nicer breakfast places to check out. Go there for Mimosas and crepes!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, all homemade. Presentation was beautiful. Definitely get the home fries. It was worth the small long trip to get here. Waitress was perfect."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast at Scratch.  The corned beef hash was excellent and really well executed.  Flavors worked well with each other and the meat was super tender.  We also had the Bread Pudding French Toast.  If you don't order this you'll regret it for the rest of your life.  It is the best spin on French Toast I've ever had - it was moist and flavorful.  Great staff, super friendly and attentive.  Give the local business owners a try, you won't regret stopping in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Not too many choices for breakfast in Independence lead my dining partner and I here. I was looking for something light so I got the strawberry shortcake waffle. While the waffle was pretty standard it was really elevated with the strawberry coulis and the maple syrup infused whipped cream. I tried the smokehouse burrito as well. It was good, very full but the pork was not what I would consider smoky. 

The waitress made a point to tell us that they try to make as much from \"scratch\" as possible. The cook also came out after the meal to see how everything was. Both of these earned a +1 in my book. Will stop by here again, next time for lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while visiting Cleveland based on Yelp reviews.   They exceeded our expectations!   Breakfast and lunch only and the food and service were spectacular!!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood & couldn't wait for Scratch to open.  Decor is trés chic.  I would give my rating four stars but the service needs some extra training (server should know what a béchamel sauce 
is if working in a French restaurant) & a bit more personality & interest. Food is served promptly but it's the initial service that's the first impression.  I love living downtown & happy to see more businesses popping up. I want them to be successful. I will be back though. I'm not ready to give up."}
{"text":"While out with a girl friend and her parents doing the First Friday thing, we happened across Scratch's newest location in downtown Phoenix. I've been to Scratch in Scottsdale and was pleasantly surprised to discover their newest location. 

Let's get a few things out of the way...

It was a First Friday. 
They just opened two weeks prior...
The space is at least 3x larger than their original location...
And...pretty much all new waitstaff.

Okay, back to the review. 

We arrived at the restaurant during peak First Friday craziness, and was promptly seated on the patio (as requested). Due to it being FF, they were only serving a limited menu of burgers. After a quick peruse of the menu, we quickly found a burger to suit all our tastes (Lamb, crab, beef). We were ready to place our order, and then we waited.....

And waited....until we flagged down the hostess and asked her to find our server. 

This is where the review could go south for most restaurants, but I give the team at Scratch a lot of credit for how they turned this experience around. The friendly hostess, our lovely bartender, the owner, and an assortment of other staff went out of their way to ensure the remainder of our experience there lived up to our expectations. And it did!! 

Sure, there were some newby mis-steps, but on the whole, the food is well-prepared, the desserts are interesting and yummy (not to mention the awesome presentation!), and most of all, the staff is friendly and engaging. 

It's a cool spot, great location, and there is so much potential here. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant that has popped up in independence. This is not your ordinary breakfast place it has new and delicious breakfast items that you probably wouldn't have thought about. The chef came out and talked to us and was very friendly his name was Brad. I made a comment about how long his hair was. He then told me he was growing it out for locks  for love. I thought that was pretty nice of him."}
{"text":"The food at Scratch is sooooo good! From apps to salads to entrees to desserts, everything is amazing. (I don't understand how salad dressing can be so incredibly delicious, but it is.) The wine selection is small, but all of the offerings are top-notch, which actually makes it easier to choose; rather than being overwhelmed by an enormous wine list, you can zero in on what you're in the mood for, and be assured that it will be fantastic. The atmosphere is casual and friendly - a bright space that works for girls' get-togethers, a romantic meal out, or just a quick lunch. Duc and the rest of his staff are incredibly gracious hosts - you can tell that they are genuinely invested in making sure you enjoy your food and your experience. I highly recommend Scratch - make sure you go hungry and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Well, not so good...My sister and I went for dinner before a show.  So happy to see this restaurant on Roosevelt Row...so sad to taste the food!  She had a salad that looked like it came from a bag except for a bit of tofu...tasteless, and I had the french onion soup, again tasteless.  I should have sent it back, but I so wanted the place to be good and I was hoping the entree would save them.  Not so much...we split the shrimp in alfredo sauce with whole grain noodles.  The whole thing looked brown and oozy.  By this time we were just sad for them.  The chef came over and asked about the food...we told him about the onion soup and he said yes he knew, and blamed it on his assistant.  No apology, nothing.

My suggestion about Scratch...don't go till they clean up their act.  Oh by the way, Sat. night @ 6:00 -7:30, one waiter!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm already a repeat customer! I am in love with the breakfast! If they take as much care with their lunch and dinner as they do their breakfast than the price and your time is worth it to try out ALL their food!! Seriously their breakfast is divine and well priced!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast meeting with clients, ordered an egg white omelet with veggies and it came swimming in butter. After soaking it up with 3 napkins I still couldn't eat it. The waitress asked if I would like it to go..REALLY? I clearly didn't touch it, but she didn't even ask if it was ok. I had to tell her it was too greasy and still she didn't care, didn't offer me another one, so of course I was still hungry and yet they charged me for it! The service was horrible, the 3 people working just hung out in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Scratch is absolutley amazing!!! I went there for brunch with my Mom the other day, and I was blown away by how good the food was and how friendly the staff was. The staff really made us feel welcome, and the decor is very nice as well, giving the restaurant a very pleasant environment. I had the Smokehouse Burrito, which was GIANT, and it was fantastic!!! The home fries that I ordered as a side were the best that I've ever had!!! We definatly will be back, and I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and the breakfast dish was not cooked properly.  I've been twice and am not going back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  Went there to meet a friend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised!  The ingredients were so fresh and the staff was super nice!  From the outside, it didn't look like much, but when you walk in, it is like walking into a very creative kitchen!  So cool!"}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast.  Food and service were both very good.  Their specialty plates are great!"}
{"text":"Very impressed - the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the food was delicious! They ended up making me a vegetarian version of the biscuits and gravy that was not on the menu... So truly \"from scratch\" and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service if you get a chance to go there in the fall get the pumpkin roll pancakes."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very pleasant. The dining was small but decorated nicely. I woke up wanting sausage gravy and biscuits. I found their plating to be appealing but the sausage gravy tasted bland. The biscuits weren't flakey. They were a bit hard."}
{"text":"How do I describe... not bad, not enough to cause a craving...but the reason for the two stars is the absolute incompetence of whoever was preparing the dishes. Literally (not figuratively) 1/4 of what was listed on the menu was not on the plate. It went kind of like this...
Me: I'll have the chef's special
Server: Ok sure I will return with that
Cook: Yea...I don't feel like making all of that 
Server: OK, just give me what you've got back there and I'll give it to him :)
This is not an exaggeration...
I am one who is more than excited to see the new growth in downtown phoenix, but am sincerely almost over the idea that \"Just showing up\" gets you the award. 
If I showed up at a car dealership and said I wanted a new mini cooper and I gave you the cash for it, then you say I changed my mind here is a dodge station wagon I would laugh you right out of business...SAME PRINCIPAL, at least offer to discount my check or something after realizing your error.
I hope these guys get it together quickly cause summer is right around the corner."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here. Small place, clean and nice. Only issue would be is that an hour lunch takes closer to two hours."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter the other morning and had heard good things from friends and family. I had scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and breakfast potatoes. Everything was obviously freshly prepared from scratch (hahaha) and came out quickly. I also asked if I could have just one biscuit and gravy, to give it a try, and they let me order a half portion even though that is not on the menu. Good that I did because the biscuit and gravy is so rich there is no way I could have eaten a full order. Glad it tried that variety of things, as I am more of a savory breakfast person, and I would encourage anyone to give it a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot! I give them a 6 out of 5!!!
I have been here 20+ times and have never had a bad meal!  I have also brought several people there that have said \"I wish this place was closer to where we live\". I am glad they are 10 minutes away for me. 
Every time we seem to get Julia and she is great at her job and always seems to be happy and in a great mood which seems to be rare for someone in her position. Keep up the great work Julia!  
One day I will have to try the lunch, I  sure it will be just as great."}
{"text":"Looking for something local and this is the place with excellent food selection and friendly service. Try it. You won't be disappointed. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"My oh my pork belly I never knew what love was till I tasted you. I ordered a BLT and the bacon was really crispy the french fries were delicious as well can't really mess up a BLT but the pork they made it with was amazing I ordered Togo . My girlfriend ordered a breakfast burrito which did not have much seasoning but the portion was pretty huge. It was also made with pork belly but the eggs weren't seasoned really well"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  So, why only 3 stars - service.  The food is extremely good.  The Bison burger was sincerely incredible.  Omelet in black truffle sauce - wow!!  Very good coffee.  But, the service is inconsistent.  First time - excellent.  Second time, slow....almost as if they did not have enough help.  They're getting started in this location, and I hope they get this issue fixed because otherwise its a 5 star experience.  I'll be back - often - and I'm sure its going to get better."}
{"text":"What a great place, wish there where more restaurants like this in the area.
Service was very friendly , the food did take a little time to come out but that is why it is made from Scratch ! 

Try their brown soup it is delicious! Ham cheese veggies - perfect !! 

Tried the scratch burger and the corned beef hash. 

Burger was great , you can taste the char on it which I love. 

Hash is not your typical hash. ( see pics) but was great also. 

Will definitely come and try again it, was very good !

Give it a try !!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch, with very low expectations for service based on previous reviews. I have to say that this was not even REMOTELY the case for me. 

I sat on the patio which was absolutely lovely. The service was incredibly prompt, and sensitive to the fact that I had less than an hour for lunch (including transit!). Our waitress was very friendly and split my friend and my check with absolutely no problem.

I had the cold smoked salmon sandwich which had avocado, cucumber and dill. It was delicious, and, I think, a pretty healthy option! The side salad with balsamic vinaigrette that came with the sandwich was equally as delicious. This was all for $7.25-- unbelievable. 

Their happy hour is 3-6, and I will definitely be back to check it out. I'm so excited to have a fun, new, and different option for lunch close to downtown."}
{"text":"I'm super excited to have Scratch in Independence.  The menu is not long, but has several interesting things to try for both breakfast (served all day) and lunch.  They also have a very reasonably priced kids' menu.  I tried the pulled pork breakfast burrito.  It was enormous (on the big side of what you expect at Chipotle), and filled with 90% pork.  I actually had to look around for the eggs and potato. The service was very friendly and quick.  I cannot wait to come back for lunch and try the tacos!

They are still very new, but I am hoping they add at least one changing table soon, and hopefully evening hours eventually."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch in a Friday. Had the pulled chicken tacos and the brown soup as pimped here on Yelp. 

Never had a soup named after a color, but damn was it good!  Kinda like a beer cheese soup with veggies and chunks of ham and chicken. Outstanding. 

The chicken tacos were very good too, with made from scratch tortilla chips and fresh homemade salsa. Could have used a bit more salt, but it was all very good. 

I need to come back and try the breakfast. From what I could see, everything looked really, really good!"}
{"text":"Went to try it today at lunch and it wasn't open.  Went to Carly's Bistro instead (fantastic!).  Called the number for Scratch when I got back to the office and it was disconnected.  Guess it's closed?"}
{"text":"This place seems to be doing some cool things on the menu. Seems the chef/cook has some creativity. Our food was good. We had breakfast foods. The Don't Call It Cornbeef Hash or whatever it's called was pretty good. It needed toast or something to go along with the meal. Eggs, peppers and tender corned beef and some other meat underneath I think which was a little crusty and dry somehow. Too much meat otherwise. Good flavors though. Wish I had tried some other stuff on the menu to get a better gauge on this place. 

The sausage patties on the plate for the other breakfast egg meal were very hard to the point of not being able to stick a fork in them without some effort. We'll give them a pass since it was later in the day. The glassware was also cloudier than most places. Maybe need to clean the dishwasher or something. 

The decor, creative in its approach of letting people draw on the walls. But it was not good as far as atmosphere. I felt as though I was eating in classroom for kids with hyper activity. Lots of scribble marks everywhere. I guess Scratch also means \"Scratch pad\" as far as the walls go. Creative but not good for a restaurant atmosphere IMO. And the chairs were cold metal and very narrow for larger people with the water at the bars come down on the chair. 

Also the waitress was closing down over an hour early and loudly dragging tables around as she mopped etc.

I wish this place had done more with reclaimed wood or something and had done better more comfortable seats. The creative menu wasn't matched by the lack of effort in decor/atmosphere. May try this place again in the future and hopefully can update to a better review."}
{"text":"Based on 2 breakfast visits I must say that I am a fan! Great coffee delicious omelets and fresh salads. Love the outdoor shaded patio. Only improvement I see is that the bike racks need lower loops down the post to accommodate using u-locks for shorter bikes like my Brompton and my wife's folding bike."}
{"text":"Most accommodating for my service dawg & me.  Excellent basic menu selection served with a flair. Not your typical 'turn-key' franchise cookie cutter breakfast place, but a boutique.   Ten stars out of 10 !!"}
{"text":"You want epically made food, Scratch is the place to go. My co-worker recommended we check it out for lunch one day. I love breakfast and was pleased to hear they offered breakfast all day. When I say this breakfast was beyond epic, we returned the next day as a nice group and I requested double the serving for breakfast. Trust me on this, you will not regret having a meal from Scratch!"}
{"text":"They really need to figure out how to manage customers waiting.   If you can't get immediate seating, find another place.   Good, but not worth the wait"}
{"text":"The hot chocolate at Scratch in Scottsdale is to die for - so, I have been not so patiently waiting for Scratch to open up a mile from my house.  I went on their soft opening to order my beloved hot chocolate and they said they didn't have the chocolate ganache at that location yet but to try back in a few days.  Okay, no worries, it was their SOFT opening. I understood and went back to eagerly waiting. 

About 2 - 3 weeks after my original visit, I went back to finally get some of this Parisian hot chocolate!  We sat down outside and ordered french fries, a latte for my man, and my hot chocolate.  The latte came.  The water came.  The fries came.  The hot chocolate never came - now, I was being patient because I know this takes about 5 - 10 minutes to make at their Scottsdale location.  When I inquired with the waiter, it was obvious he had forgotten it and came back 5 minutes later explaining the CAFE did not serve the hot chocolate - but the PASTRY SHOP did.  The pastry shop downtown was not open yet and no one in the CAFE knew how to make it.  Then why the hell (pardon my French) is hot chocolate listed on 2 different menus for the cafe?!   I felt like the whole visit was a waste because we would not have ordered the watered-down latte or fries if we were informed about hot chocolate at the beginning - after all, we were really only there for that. 

I'm about to give up on this place and fly to Paris.

EDIT (04/04):  I was walking the dog around the neighborhood and noticed the PASTRY SHOP was open.  I asked for a hot chocolate.  And, get this, no one there knew how to the work the machine to make it. Ahhhhh!!!"}
{"text":"Great place,  limited seating and menu.   But the food was all good.   We got the bread pudding French toast,  strawberry Belgian waffle, biscuits and gravy (added eggs), and my son got a pancake.  

Portions are large,  we would split the dishes in the future.  

Bonus,  they have a fence press coffee although they were out and I didnt get one. :( the regular coffee is great."}
{"text":"This is a terrific alternative to the \"family restaurants\" that litter the South and Southwest suburbs of Cleveland. Kitschy, fun and an innovative menu with some great surprises. I went for lunch and I could not resist trying the Hot Brown Soup. Although not actually brown, it was soup and it may actually have been a little too hot when served, but it was delicious and unique. Picture a cheese soup, but mildly cheesy with ham and vegetables. Creamy, piquant, and savory, it was a nice accompaniment to the BLT, made with house-smoked pork belly. Fantastic. This restaurant has been open for two months, the service was excellent and with iced tea my lunch came to just over $12. 

This is probably not a place to bring a picky eater, especially a young one (there are kids menu items for breakfast), but if you enjoy food with creative twists, well executed and pretty quick, you should give this place a try.

Open 7 am to 3pm, Tuesday - Saturday, breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"This place is cute, cozy and DELICIOUS!  Great twist on traditional favorites.  I have never had a bad meal.  The staff is so friendly and happy as well, smiles everywhere.  Absolutely a must try!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food and was told by a friend that this place has the best breakfast around.  Within a few days of his recommendation I tried it and the Tiramisu Pancakes ARE AMAZING!!!  I decided to go back on Saturday with my husband, so he could experience the food.  He ordered the Corned Beef Hash and love it!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Scratch today for breakfast for the first time.  I was impressed by their really good reviews.  I can agree with some of the reviews about the place being 'laid back'.  I would call it 'Goodwill Chic'.  I was only one of two people at the time I went.  The place was quite bright.  Actually really bright.

The walls are painted white and are covered by graffiti, apparently from customers.  I didn't ask.  But I asked how long they had been in business and was told it was just over a year.  That means the walls had not been cleaned in quite a while since doing so would have smeared the graffiti and it wasn't

It is not a large area.  Maybe 9 regular tables and two bar type tables.  The chairs are metal folding chairs.  No seat cushions.  For someone who has had double hip replacement, it was less than comfortable.

Server was extremely nice.  Very pleasant.   Very attentive.  Ordered the 'All American' breakfast.  They had pork belly, no bacon.  I chose the sausage instead and white toast.  Also came with 'breakfast potatoes'.  

When the food arrived I quickly discovered that the plates were way too small for all of the food.  It was an oblong square plate.  Food was stacked on top of  each other.  The eggs were done correctly for over-easy but they were served yolk down.  Should have been served yolk up.  The potatoes were a bit odd.  They were chopped chunks of potato.  All different sizes.  Problem was that the smaller pieces were over-cooked and the larger ones were under-cooked.  The sausage patties were not to my liking.  They had a strong taste, maybe of too much fennel.  And they were very dry.  Didn't appear to have much fat content.  The white toast was two giant slices of Italian type white bread.  Way too thick.  They should have sliced them thinner and given four slices, like the wheat and rye toast I observed.  

Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with either the décor or the food.  Average at best.  Not the type of place that I would return to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Bustling atmosphere with good people, great food, and humble spirit.

Loud when busy...not the place for intimate conversation.

Taste the brown soup...and take some home."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because I have a soft spot in my heart for independently-owned places that do the right thing and make everything house-made.  I went with the burrito.  It was under seasoned so out came the salt shaker.  The French fries, on the other hand, Were really really good. Wow. My friend got the 4-egg omelette and no joke it was the width of a football. Huge!  Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  Service was attentive. Decor is simple. People seem to love to write on the walls!  The food is good, not great in my opinion, but for the folks in the area that might be fine for them."}
{"text":"Here are a few things to consider before you dine at a restaurant named Scratch:
Quite possibly you will be eating something made from scratch, which may take a little longer to prepare than the average restaurant.
You will have an opportunity to enjoy the freshest, in season quality ingredients.
You will be able to have handmade, fresh baked, painstakingly prepared French croissants in the morning and in the evening a tray of beautifully detailed French desserts will arrive table side for you to select from...there were 13 different options on a recent visit.  

I think Scratch is best enjoyed when you are not in a hurry, and perhaps not (yet) on nights when there is a mob scene, though I think they will master that in time. Lovely patio dining options (with great people watching) to enjoy before the heat comes.  Staff who are clearly friendly, attentive and take great pride in quality ingredients, cooking and service when the place is not slammed.  They mentioned on a recent visit that they are working on expanding their vegetarian and vegan offerings, so stay tuned for that.  Impeccably brewed, flavorful French teas.  Murals by local artists on the streetside planters, a parklike promenade and great ambience.  I love that they are open from 8 am - 10 pm weekdays and until 2 am on weekends.  That is ambitious for downtown Phoenix and deserves our support until they work out some of the details mentioned in other reviews. 
So here is my advice on Scratch.  Put yourself in a leisurely frame of mind, go on over there on a weeknight when you  can have the staff's undivided attention and I think you will be charmed with what Scratch is offering.  KJ the chef is a wizard  from what I have tasted so far, I plan to be back again and again to this cozy neighborhood gathering place."}
{"text":"Came to Scratch today with my family, expecting great things from wonderful Yelp reviews.  I dunno, I was underwhelmed.  Maybe they had an off day? 

Nestled in a little strip mall near rockside, Scratch is an unassuming store on the outside. Inside, they have a neat industrial chic look to it.  Their wall where you could sign was a clever indy touch.  I thought that the chalk signs were cute on the walls. 

So good things first - their menu sounded delicious and honestly there were some good things on it.  I enjoyed my tiramisu pancakes, a lot actually, but The Wife did point out that the sauce tasted a lot more like chocolate than coffee and she was right.  The home fries were delicious shards of potatoes deep fried perfectly and the French fries were respectable.  The chicken noodle soup tasted homemade.  Not incredible, but home made.  Grilled cheese for the kid was a good value at $2.50, with a full serving of French fries. 

Less good- pretty consistently the items that came out of the kitchen looked a lot more ordinary than it sounded on the description in the menu.  My wife's Latke Slider did not look like a slider- it was a Latke with corned beef and cheese on it.  I'm not sure what is \"slider\" - like about it.  Didn't taste bad but was kind of ordinary.  Our waitress seemed a little hard of hearing- we had to repeat nearly everything that we said to her. Seemed nice enough though.  Our small salad had more than 5 pieces of slimy wilted lettuce leaves in it.  I almost never send anything back to the kitchen but this was too much.  So we did. 

My sisters biscuits and sausage looked pretty on the plate but were leaden and nearly cool by the time it got to the table.  The gravy had started to form a film on top and it was not salty enough.  The sausage tasted homemade, which is generally good, but was somewhat forgettable.  Pork Belly?  Sounds good except when it came to the table, it was just thick cut bacon.  Call a spade a spade people- ain't nothing wrong with that. They also didn't give us the sausage that was supposed to come with my niece's strawberry pancake.  

In the end, the redeeming factors of Scratch was that it was a pretty good value and had a cool interior.  I like that it was a local place.  In the end, however, I felt like it wasn't really that difference from what you can get at Bob Evans.  Actually to be honest, as much as I hate to say this, but I suspect that we like Bob Evans better. Especially those biscuits.  Doubt we'll be back, but I hope that the consistency improves in this restaurant.  Maybe we'll try it again in the future if the reviews look good. 

Overall, I was disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"This is a somewhat hard review for me to write as, like other reviewers, I've long lamented the disappearance of the local breakfast hangout. So when this place popped up in Independence, I couldn't wait to try it.

I've gone 3 or 4 times now to make sure I was okay with how I felt about the place - which is just okay.  I really wish I could give them 4 stars or more, but for me, its just a 3.  I wondered if it was just not a fit for me, but then reading many of the other reviews, I see I'm not alone.

While I love that the place is open and bright, the hard metal chairs just aren't very comfortable.  Especially when I look around and every time I go it seems like the clientele is mostly older.  The decor is cute, almost kitschy, but doesn't really fit the menu, which is oriented around more upscale items.  Walking in I thought it was going to be more diner-like and it's more Blue Door like.  And then there's the scribbles all over the wall - at first I thought I was just grumpy and most people probably found it cute, but after visiting a number of times and reading some other reviews - it's just kind of distracting and not very visually appealing.  

So all of that could just be chalked up to style preference, right?  How's the food and the service?

Service?  Kind of hit or miss.  It's the kind of place you go in that only has 10 tables, there's only people sitting at two of them, and it takes 10 minutes to get waited on.  Kids playing in the kitchen.  Loud music coming out of the open air kitchen.  Again - not trying to be a grump, but just seems kind of inefficient overall and lacking a touch of professionalism.  Acceptable at a leisurely dinner, for a breakfast place, a lot of people can be in a rush.  Overall though - not a huge deal and service is generally decent.

The food is where I was disappointed.  First of all, very hard to eat anything even remotely healthy here.  Other than the one diner standard on the menu (eggs, meat, potatoes) almost everything is huge and covered in some sort of sauce(s).  As mentioned elsewhere, the potatoes are just big chunks of redskins that are thrown into the fryer.  I love biscuits and gravy so ordered a side of the gravy the other day.  It was good, but soooo rich.  Tasted like basically a stick of butter melted in a cup of whipping cream.  Mac and cheese covered in pulled pork.  Omelette is FOUR eggs and barely fits on the plate.

Also - the food just seems at odds with the decor.  With a name like \"Skratch\", spelled the way it is, rough wood panels on the wall and kitsch throughout, you'd think you'd see a normal diner menu, but the food is more upscale with items like Bread Pudding French Toast and Tiramisu Pancakes (with prices to match).

So again - I think this one is just a personal mismatch for me when it comes to rating it, and I was expecting something different.  Nothing stands out as \"bleh - so bad\", it's just not there for me.  If you don't care about the calories, decor doesn't matter, you've got a little time to hang out, and you're looking for something a little more interesting than eggs and bacon - you will probably really like this place."}
{"text":"A quaint atmosphere with a creative menu. Huge portions, with great taste. My wife and I got the Tiramisu Pancakes and Smokehouse Burrito. The pancakes were covered in creamy chocolate ganache and the pulled pork in the Burrito had a great smokey flavor.  We will be back and can't wait to tell others."}
{"text":"I had a great time... love the place, love the space, love that they have invested in downtown and believe that everyone should be as constructive as possible in writing a review... a 1-star review should usually mean you got food poisoning and were robbed and yelled at by staff... a 2-star review means you got an upset stomach and were rudely treated with no respect... a 3-star review is average, a 4-star review very good, and a 5-star review is a wonderful experience.  My experience was 5-stars... I was offered tastes of small, freshly baked items that had just come out of the oven, from the chef/owner who is a true Parisian from the 3rd arrondissement... the breakfast is excellent, lunch great, desserts out of this world... I think you're going to see some wonderful things happen here.  Heck, if he could make it in central Paris, I think he can make it here...  

oh, and before I knew the chef was from Paris, my friend ordered an omelette and when it came out, it reminded me of an omelette I had at the Crillon in Paris... sounds weird, but a omelette in France is just somehow different, doesn't look like it came out of a cookie-cutter, looked like an egg cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing.  paired with their great coffee and a croissant.... simple perfection.

thank you for being part of the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very good food!  Had the Scratch Burger. Meat was fresh and tasty. My mom had the salad with grilled chicken added. She enjoyed!  They could use more servers although the waitress was pleasant and hustled. Atmosphere has character. It's very loud in there, so a little hard to have a nice conversation. I'd like to try breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I hope to come back and give them more stars next time.
The good - the menu is really creative and brings a bit of sophistication to the Downtown salad and sandwich scene.  Also, the place is cool and airy, hip and comfy.  
  
The bad - we had some service issues.  After being very attentive when we arrived, our waitress forgot that we were on a 45 minute lunch break and left us to languish  (and left our finished burger sitting on the counter staring at us for over 5 minutes).  

The cooks forgot to make our second sandwich and fries, and when the waitress went to check on it, the cooks got into a fight that we could hear in the dining room, and one of the cooks stormed out.  We did eventually get fries (albeit not the ones we ordered), but ended up having to get the sandwich to go (b.c we'd already finished sharing the the burger and had to leave to get back to work).  While the burger was fantastic (Wagyu beef with sauteed mushrooms - yum), and the fries were tasty and crispy, the grilled cheese was just a slice of cheddar on some toast (maybe there was a mistake and we got the kiddie version????).

OKAY, so I'm sure you are wondering why I gave them 3 stars and will ever go again . . . because, despite the snafus, the food we did get was really good and the waitress bent over backwards to \"make it right\".  She apologized and kept us informed, she comped some of our food, etc.  So, in the end, she saved us as customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through town on a trip and stopped here for brunch. Our server, Maggie was sweet and very friendly. Our food came out pretty quickly considering everything is made from scratch. My husband loved the smoked pork belly! The environment is very laid back; complete with sharpies and pens for the customers to write on the walls. Prices are very reasonable, it was around $20 before the tip for both of us."}
{"text":"I could see the potential of this small place. We had to wait a bit but were really looking forward to a decent breakfast. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs ala carte.  My friend ordered the pancakes. I did not care for my dish at all. The gravy was gritty and the sausage had the taste of liquid smoke which I felt over powered the entire dish. Also it was not very hot at all. My eggs were, well eggs. I ate them. We never saw our server again until the end. My friend had coffee and was never offered a refill until right before the check was finally offered. I ate 2 bites and was offered a bag which I declined. I was never asked if everything was ok. I did not want to complain in front of my company unless I was asked. I saw many dishes that looked great. I might of maybe ordered something that was just not my taste, but to charge me full price or not even offer me something else I had to give this below average rating. I left hungry, thirsty (my water was empty after my 2nd bite) and out $25. Not happy at all. Very amateur at best."}
{"text":"Cute place with great coffee and delicious food!!! My husband had the special- pumpkin roll pancakes... yum! Great service too.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my mother for a weekday breakfast. She usually likes the mom and pop greasy spoons, but I was able to talk her into something different. Holy Toledo are we both glad we did. I got the pudding French toast, and she had the corned beef hash. I have never ever enjoyed corned beef hash in my life. Now I don't want to eat anything but this corned beef hash. The corned beef is sliced thin and placed on top of potato latkes fried crispy but still soft inside, topped with two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs. My French toast was delicious and had boozy syrup drizzled over top. Grown up and decadent. Coffee is excellent and local. Decor is reminiscent of magnolia farms, but chip and Joanna would be proud. Service is also excellent and clear that it is a personal venture. Really enjoyed this spot. Please come and support the pants off this place. I need more smoked pork belly in my life."}
{"text":"It's locally owned. In Independence that should almost be enough, but it turns out the food is worth the trip as well.  Don't be put off by the limited menu, everything on it is delicious. Today I had the special which was a well prepared chicken Philly wrap.  Down right good. The portions are fair for the prices,  the servers are pleasant, the food comes quick, and they do breakfast all day.  I'm a fan.  Dukedom here I come."}
{"text":"First timer... orderd chicken tacos online... quick, easy and really good!I lived in AZ for 20 years and particular on my mexican... will definitely be back.  Great vibe inside and nice friendly staff.  Thanks Yelp--didn't know they were there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch with great service. All of our meals were fantastic and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am going to update this review, because it really wasn't worth 4 stars simply for the good location and cool remodel. Truthfully, the food was bad and the service was bad, because there was only one waiter in the whole place. He was doing his best but it just wasn't enough. AND they ran out of croissants. What french place runs out of croissants? I'm still a little upset about it a week later."}
{"text":"We were in town for my boyfriends work conference and we're looking for something filling and comforting after that and  a long early morning drive with nothing in our bellies. Cue Scratch--something brunchy and with corned beef sounded absolutely perfect. 

It's tucked into a little strip mall and it's pretty small inside but luckily they weren't super busy when we got there. 

I had a hard time deciding because that's just my personality, so my BF agreed to split a third entree; I got the corned beef, he got the salmon Benedict, and we got the strawberry shortbread waffles to share. 

First of all everything was beautiful. The corned beef was clearly home done with lots of beautiful and and tue peppers and potato cake were a great touch. The BF really enjoyed his Benedict which had a slightly lemony sauce--the salmon was perfect. 

The waffles we split were also very good--I'm pretty picky about waffles so I think they could have used a bit more depth of flavor, but the coulis was awesome and they definitely really hit the spot after our meals. 

All in all very good food and reasonably priced. 

There is a wall inside that they put markers out to get signed...I used it to write I love you for the first time--so we'll say this place holds a soft spot for me now. :)"}
{"text":"Three times I'm a row we have been impressed. It's the only type of restaurant in the area. Always packed. Always good. B fest burrito. Worth the calories."}
{"text":"Ate here while on a visit back to PHX and glad to see this corner of 3rd st and Roosevelt getting a face lift.   Very open/comfortable space with good coffee and food."}
{"text":"We cleared our plates and bowls! Found this place on our way home from a cavs game, and we will DEFINITELY be back! Great service, variety of food, and a fun atmosphere to boot. Everyone here was laughing and having a good time. The staff informed people as they walked in that they were currently out of a few things, just so no one was disappointed before had their hearts set on something they didn't have."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch place!  Burrito, corned beef hash, salmon Benedict all got rave reviews from our party of 4.  Thanks, Yelpers, for the great recommendation!  Coffee is delicious, service excellent, and almost forgot...the chicken noodle soup was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the search for a good breakfast/brunch place, and Scratch recently appeared as an option. I was a little concerned since it is a decent distance away from where I am, but seeing the reviews/pictures on Yelp convinced me to give it a shot--and I am so glad I did!

When you walk into the restaurant, you first seat yourself and the waiter will come by with the menu. The menu is pretty small, and just has a breakfast side and a lunch side. I quite liked how simple it was though. We ended up ordering the Smokehouse Burrito and the Strawberry Shortcake Waffles with a side of sausage (you can choose pork belly), and an extra side of Homefries.
-Smokehouse Burrito: now this is a burrito! I was saying how it is huge, and probably bigger than a burrito you could get at Chipotle. It is also packed with meat and is delicious, albeit a little difficult/messy to eat. It comes on a bed of potatoes that are packed with flavor despite how small the chunks are.
-Strawberry Shortcake Waffles: unfortunately, mine was a little burnt, but I didn't want to bother them and ask for a new plate. Was still great and I demolished the whole thing. It was nice that it came with a savory side, as I often have trouble deciding between sweet and salty.
-Homefries: These were huge chunks of deep fried potatoes. Piping hot and extra crispy. I was really happy with these too.

Overall Scratch is a great restaurant! It is small and has a homey feel to it. Best of all is the fact that the food is plentiful and delicious, and it is at such a reasonable price! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once thus far, and I'm giving it a full 5 stars in spite of the fact that it took quite a while for us to get our food (they were very busy).

Why, you ask?  Because the food was just THAT good.  I sampled my friends' food too, and it was nearly magical in its goodness.

I had the breakfast burrito (that I can't remember the actual name of), and it was pretty much flawless (if huge).  I have zero complaints about it--the pork was tender and had a great, smoky taste, and they managed to get just the right amount of crisp to the potatoes.

I tried a sampling of the tiramisu pancakes (yes, they are a thing), and they kinda blew my mind.  I'm not even going to try to describe them--just go eat them.

I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on service because, though it took a long time to get our food, our server was nice, and she was also attentive.  I have a feeling they're also growing, in terms of patronage, faster than they expected.  They were packed.  Add that to the amazing food, and I think they've earned the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Breakfast was okay. The pudding french toast too thick and lack flavor . Service was acceptable. I was  observing the cook since you can see him from the dining area .  What you don't know won't hurt !"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because the food is great and the service has improved dramatically. I have a feeling they will outgrow the current building soon, because it's just that good."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. They literally make almost everything on the menu from scratch. So far we have tried the chicken soft tacos, burgers, Scratch breakfast  and Cuban sandwich- all were outstanding. The service is fabulous. Benjamin was our server on the most recent trip. He was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Thanks for a great experience! I hope that they will consider expanding their hours to Sunday and/or dinner time."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a decent biscuits and gravy for awhile.   Scratch has by far the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had.  I realize that's a bold statement but it's a fact.  Perfectly seasoned.  Large portion.   Just wonderful.  They also offered a to go cup for my coffee. That's a thoughtful touch.  Plenty of parking outside.  5 stars all the way around."}
{"text":"This place is closed. They filed for bankruptcy. 
http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/06/scratch_pastries_phoenix_scottsdale_closes.php"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with friendly staff! Food was excellent; wait was about 20min. High top tables should are better suited for the under 55 crowd."}
{"text":"Another case of \"I can't wait to try this place!\" and then being underwhelmed.Large portions(I got the breakfast burrito) but it was rather bland. The thing that bothered me most was the server dropping my check 5 minutes after I got my food and kept circling around reminding me that she can take that when I'm ready... Several empty tables, so there was no hurry. Not sure what the deal was, but I'm in no hurry to return. Sorry Scratch!"}
{"text":"Last week was my first opportunity to try Scratch.  I've been hearing about it for the last month or two from friends on Facebook.  I can say that it does not disappoint.  The food lived up to the hype.  My breakfast burrito was huge and delicious, although the eggs inside were slightly overcooked.  The pork is smoked in house and it is up there with some of the best I have had.  The service is friendly and prompt.  The restaurant itself left a lot to be desired, though.  It was really chilly and the chairs were hard.  The food more than made up for the experience, but at this price point I wish the place was a little more comfortable.  Either way, I will be back to enjoy Scratch soon!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and affordable. They have a fun atmosphere and good portions. However, the waitress was a little rude, seemed pretty stressed. Maybe she needed some help waiting tables? Overall, a good experience and we will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I am generally a harsh critic of restaurants, but Scratch is far and away the best in Independence (If not one of the best in Cleveland)! I have been 5 or 6 times, each time I am genuinely surprised by how great the food is. 

They have totally reasonable prices, cook from \"scratch,\" and will hopefully be a fixture in the community for years to come. I love the restaurant and will not stop recommending it to all looking for an absolutely wonderful meal."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty awesome.

Wish it were bigger for sure due to the crazy wait st times and wish the menu had more options for picky eaters and the more budget conscious crew. 

We loved all our food dishes. The salad was HUGE and nice warm piece of chicken on there too! The dressing was meh, wayyy to oily for me. But everything else was fantastic on it. Others got the veggie wrap, Cubano, salmon benedict, and tacos. The taco shells were corn and not her favorite as they were dense but everyone else liked everything else! I would totally order the tacos with no shell as they were a good portion! 

Love the writing on the walls, we were entertained by that the whole time and even added something too! The decor was simple and appreciated, the scratch sign when you entree is obviously the eye catching piece and it works! The staff was quick and accommodating, even after we rushed them because we had to get back to work! The food came out fast, and it's so obvious they are whipping it up as you order (hence the name, scratch!) 

I will be back for sure to try something else, like that killer burrito or the sausage gravy!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for lunch because I was getting sick of the usual selection of fast food. I got takeout. My order was ready when they said it would be. I got an omelet because who doesn't love breakfast all day? I asked for veggies and I got what I asked for. It was great! My toast was a bit soggy but it might have been because it was all steamy in the food container. I will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday for lunch. The atmosphere is inviting and fun. The service was amazing. Our waitress was friendly, gave great suggestions, and brought us fresh drinks proactively. We felt so well taken care of. Now the best part is the food! We had the smokehouse burrito and the shredded chicken soft tacos. Both dishes were phenomenal. Some of the best food we have ever had! Everything was so flavorful and fresh and the servings were large. On top of that the prices were great. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On those rare occasions when I eat before noon and the grub simply must be of the breakfast-y variety I always find myself seeking out two things - local and made from scratch. Of course it must also come with a heaping helping of friendly service and deliciousness, but I'm preaching to the choir, am I not?

But what is there to eat for breakfast in Independence? I know that's what you're thinking. Mostly chains and fast food is the answer. Well, Scratch is looking to single-handedly change all that with their own brand of built from the ground up vittles. They're actually a breakfast and lunch spot, but I've only been there for the former, so alas this review is weighted in only that direction. Don't worry, their breakfast is well worth a single Yelp. Trust me on this.

As the name implies, Scratch is all about, well, made from scratch. They've managed to carve out a tasty little food niche for themselves in the Independence area - not exactly what I'd call a dining destination - by crafting a concise breakfast and lunch menu rife with fresh, flavorful dishes made from ingredients locally sourced whenever possible. 

The space is pretty small, as most eateries of its ilk are apt to be, but cozy in that just right sorta way. Lots of light, too, so hangovers best beware. Yeah, you catch what I'm throwing. It's all open, too, the kitchen's right there all out and proud, and there's a mix of high-top and low top tables. As others have mentioned, their walls are covered in customer-supplied graffiti and if you've got the time and the notion, you can find some rather entertaining - and sometimes not so family friendly - creations. I highly recommend letting those peepers take a wander whilst you nosh.

Speaking of nosh, the food here doesn't disappoint. Sure, they've only got about 8 dishes to choose from, but who needs a massive missive when you're hungry in the am. Just get to the point. Short, sweet and executed with passion. Get your all-American breakfast with eggs, toast, home fries and bacon, challenge your GI tract with a pulled pork breakfast burrito, or just screw it altogether and cram your face with tiramisu pancakes. I told you it was good. And the coffee, my god the coffee.

On the morning of our visit the place hadn't yet started jumpin. We were early for brunch and late for the crack of dawn set. Perfect timing for us. Our server quickly took us to our table, brough coffees and waters, and offered friendly advice as we looked over the menu. She was attentive, never let our coffees get below half-full (or is it half-empty), and cleared plates all timely like. Just the right amount of server.

Some of the food highlights: the seedy, healthy, perfectly toasted bread. Thick, glutinous and glorious. The over easy eggs were cooked to perfection, politely yielding their yellowy guts upon request, and the crispy, crunchy, caramelized home fries with pork belly will make you wanna smack your momma. Some of the little letdowns: my scrambled eggs were runny in the middle. They tasted wonderful, just like 'em a little closer to food than baby chick The strawberry shortcake waffle was my least favorite. When I read \"strawberry shortcake\" I expected strawberries. What I got was a little drizzle of strawberry coulis that had soaked into the rather dry waffles and all but disappeared. C'mon, man. Toss some fresh berries on this bad boy and be done with it.

So there you have it. Scratch is a welcome addition to the area. We need more places that put the emphasis on local, quality, fresh-made goodies. We need more locals spending their money at said places and I need more space because I ramble like nobody's business. Get your butt on one of their seats, put some of their food into to your head's inbox, and enjoy it. Because you will."}
{"text":"Stopped by Scratch during lunch on a Friday and there were busy!! A couple of tables were empty, but there were still dirty plates and utensils left by the last people who sat there. I waited about 5 minutes for a table and while I was waiting for a table to be cleared off, I can tell that if they had a 3rd server on the floor, everyone would have been a little more satisfied. Aside from that, our food tasted good and very from scratch.

One pointer would be not to wear nice clothing to this establishment because your clothing will smell like the kitchen afterwards. I believe the ventilation in kitchen was not the best and because it is an open kitchen, the smells of the restaurant traveled from the back of the kitchen to the dining area. One pet peeve of mine is smelling like food when I walk out of a restaurant and that is exactly what happened."}
{"text":"This was the first time to Scratch.  It definitely will not be the last. A simple yet innovative menu. This find, serves only breakfast and lunch. Industrial chic is a good description of the space once you get inside. Most importantly the food and service was outstanding. I had their signature burrito and my dinning companion had the American breakfast plus we shared an order of cinnamon roll pancakes. All to die for!! I can't wait to make the trip back to enjoy more.  Service was genuine and spot on.  One can feel the pride of these young restaurateurs.
Kudos to all!  See you again soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I read the reviews and came here for breakfast on Monday morning, when it was closed. We were a little sad, but found another spot. Yesterday morning, we came back, and it was worth the wait. The coffee was delicious and kept coming! We had three in our party, I had the special, which was chicken & waffle - perfect waffle, delicious chicken. My husband had an enormous omelette, which he ate every bite of, and my daughter had the strawberry shortcake pancakes, which she said were terrific because the strawberries still had a bit of tartness, it wasn't just overwhelming sweetness. Her pancakes came with pork belly bacon, and she let me have a piece, and it was nothing less than perfect. 

We were visiting my daughter, but we will definitely come back the next time we are in Ohio! And I'm planning my grafitti for next time."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, first time was during the week. Service was ok, not very friendly or attentive, but definitely not rude or ridiculous in anyway. Second time was on a Saturday. They really push you in and out. Drinks and food were ordered immediately, check is out quickly, and they are taking the signed copy away before you are finished eating. Food is good, menu makes things sound much more interesting than the dishes actually are, but still a good value. Good place to come during the week to meet for breakfast or lunch when the food and service is better. I wouldn't come here to catch up with friends for brunch again with better options out there."}
{"text":"This has been a great find.  I have been here twice and both times had great food and fast friendly service. Smokehouse burrito is huge, and Corned Beef \"hash\" and eggs are awesome."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place and the trendy menu and decor suggested I would. The food didn't disappoint. The breakfast burrito and bread pudding French toast was everything we hoped for but the wait was ridiculously long. On a Saturday afternoon, we waited 15 minutes for a table for 2 then waited another 40 minutes for food after we placed our order. If they could improve the speed of operations, this cozy restaurant could rival some of the best brunch spots in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week; I really enjoyed the food. I ate the bltc sandwich. Delish!"}
{"text":"A very nice little café, it is spartan in its décor but this adds to the charm. It also makes the room a slight echo chamber, so it does amplify the children that haven't grasped the concept of inside voices yet. 

The food was excellent. I got the corned beef hash. Moist, thin slices of corned beef with sautéed onions and peppers, scrambled eggs (because I'm not a sunny side up fan), and a boxty (an Irish version of the potato pancake). All in all, superb. Toast would have been a welcome addition to the meal, I'll have to ask for a side next time."}
{"text":"Great food--a hidden gem. Inexpensive French bistro and pastry and French tea (nearly impossible to find in Phoenix)."}
{"text":"Tiramisu pancakes with vanilla mousse and chocolate granache???
Are you kidding me??
I kid you not...
Just opened this week and it's an eclectic little place in Independence thats easy to find cause it's right on Brecksville road in an easy to spot strip...
So coworker and I pop in and notice the decor, very industrial and well built!
I can't stand wobbly tables or chairs and this place must have hand built them because the furniture alone had that rock solid feel and I got to tell you that lends well to the dining experience!!
Service was spot on and we got to meet the chef and owner!!!
You guys know I put myself through college working in the restaurant biz so I can be a bit picky...But Scratch? Well done...Well done...
I need a nap...."}
{"text":"I'm writing my updated review immediately after picking up an order today because these guys are just that great. Staff is always so pleasant when I come in and when you talk to the owners you can tell they really delight in what they are doing, they care about their customers, and they genuinely want you to have a tasty food experience.

Currently I'm shoving their mac & cheese special into my mouth between sentences. Seriously this isn't even what I originally ordered but it is soooooooo good! I had called today to get my regular taco meal, but when I got there I just could not resist the temptation of trying their mac & cheese special. I had only wanted to try a tiny sample, but they ended up making me a full order! Getting back to work I was like \"okay, I can have just one bite then I'll put this away for dinner later\". In reality I had one bite and could not stop! After taking a breath and realizing I ate 2/3 of this and my pants were about to split and I was about to slide under my desk in a delicious food coma, I stopped. I put the fork down, closed the lid, put it back in the bag and shoved it out of sight before the tasty carbs had a chance to completely take over my mind.

Sweet baby Jesus I am going to end up on that show, \"My 600lbs Life\". 

But listen, it was good. Real good. 

A huge portion with their pulled pork on top. The pasta was gemelli in this creamy coat-your-insides cheese sauce. To me it tasted like there was fresh garlic and chopped fresh tomatoes hidden in this masterpiece. 

I'm struggling to keep my eyes open; the food coma is here! 

I have to go for a walk around the building so I'll wrap this review up. I 100% support this local restaurant and hope that they continue to succeed! For the lady who gave a 2 star review and said the food was bland, well, I think maybe you're just old and your taste buds have all died off. For the guy who gave 1 star because of the wait, well, it's a popular small restaurant, have some patience or order take-out next time. 

Okay, I might need help, someone roll me outside like Violet from Willy Wonka, please."}
{"text":"Great food. Unfortunately the score is because one of the waitresses was extremely rude to me and my friend (to the point where it ruined both of our days) We were trying to enjoy breakfast after we both had worked a 12 hour shift at the hospital. I will never eat in the restaurant again because the rude woman (older woman, the younger girls were great) still works there, but I do occasionally get the food from time to time through online orders. 

Great great food, it's a must go.... if you pick it up.



Update: went back 1-4-18, amazing service, great food. Different atmosphere. Loved it."}
{"text":"I went there with my guy pal and I'm only giving this place four stars cause we had the dinner AND dessert.   If it was JUST the dessert, I'd give it more than the maximum five stars.  First the dessert:   I had the Irish crumble and he had the lemon tart.  WOW!!!   The Irish crumble flavor, texture, and aesthetic appeal was nothing short of phenomenal.    It was layered with two different types of chocolate and heavy cream.   Very light and airy and just the right amount.   I don't know what else it is made of, but I'd sure like the recipe.    I wonder if the owner will share it??!!   The lemon tart was fabulously wonderful as well.   Yes, my guy pal let me have a bite, but only a bite.   Lemon desserts are not my favorite desserts, and I count chocolate as one of the major food groups.   So you know which dessert I liked better.

The bakery is adjacent to the restaurant.   So much to choose from.   All of them are a work of art.   And I bet they taste as good as they look.   The perfect place to get that special someone a wonderfully delicious dessert.   

As far as dinner, I had the seared jumbo scallops in white wine creamy garlic sauce with fresh veggies, and he had the Budda beer and burger special.  The scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked.   Geeezzzz, I hate it when places overcook the seafood!  Not this place.   El perfecto.  The sauce had the perfect blend of creamy sauce and garlic.   If I had some rice to go along with it, I would have sopped up the sauce with the rice.   Hey, I'm Asian.   What can I say??

His burger was good as well.   I'm not a real hamburger kinda gal.   But it was good as burgers go.

The owner is truly from France.   He is friendly, and makes it a point of going to each table, and talking to his guests.   He wrote his name and number down, but, for the life of me, I can't read his writing.   He told me he is half Japanese and half Chinese.   I found it quite interesting that an Asian speaks with a French accent.    Guess I need to get out more.

I'd definitely go back, especially to try the many other eye-appealing desserts."}
{"text":"Wow, very unassuming for the outside, total warm and inviting place on the inside. Staff was great food was amazing. Scratch isn't just a buzzword, it's apparent they made the food from scratch and made it with live and care. Great place, will be back."}
{"text":"Scratch elevates breakfast food to a new level. 

I work nights and decided to stop by on my way home as I like to try new places and support small business.  I wasn't disappointed.

Coffee is full bodied and fresh.  I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict.  Lovely salmon, 2 perfectly poached eggs over sliced potato and baby arugula.  Topped off with freshly made Hollandaise sauce. 
Yum.  Beautiful dishes were being served all around me.  Can't wait to go back and try it for lunch. 

The decor reminds me of Magnolia Farms repurposing style. Very current and relaxing.  Play great new music as well. 

The staff are friendly and genuine.  The chef came out and asked how I liked my food as the creation was his idea. This young man has a bright future judging from what I saw coming out of the kitchen. 

Located near the quaint town square in Independence, Scratch is a great alternative to the chains lining Rockside Road.  I got there around 9 am. Only a few customers. By the time I left the place was almost full.  Prices are a little higher than your typical diner but the food is definitely worth it. 

Overall a surprisingly great experience.  I highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative to your usual breakfast/lunch spot."}
{"text":"Really cute little place. I loved the feature wall as soon as you walk in. They have a nice bright modern-country atmosphere, and everything was very clean. Our food was good and the potatoes most of all. Our server, Hans was very polite and attentive. They lost a star from me because 90% of their menu was full of gluten and not really any choices for us non gluten diners. I would probably go back."}
{"text":"I just love this little diner. It has so much spunk and personality. It has handwriting all over the walls, hence the name Scratch. Clever. I've had this place bookmarked for months and months but now I finally made it here on a beautiful spring day in Cleveland in April for lunch. I live about an hour away from here so it was a hike but I've been meaning to come here. I'm so glad I did.
They serve only breakfast and lunch which is a downside.  I can't make it for their opening hours. I just happen to have an off day during the week which does not happen often. They have an assortment of menu items with their own flair. I chose the salmon Benedict. No English muffin here...right? Perfectly cooked salmon and two perfectly poached eggs come on top of arugula lettuce and rutabagas with a sauce. First time trying rutabagas. Tastes like a Potato or potatoe if you prefer. You can't beat the price for a dish with that good of salmon for only 13$!! Not including tax and tip. 
The staff was so polite and welcoming. It seems a lot of people come here for a nice meal and sit and chat. Good place to bring family and friends. The kids would love the writing on the walls.
I can't wait to return with my parents for brunch someday. Would have to be on the weekend though. That bread pudding French toast is calling my name. I just wish this place was bigger and open for longer hours. People work..and can't enjoy your good food often as they could. I would definitely recommend. It was worth my 1 hour drive!"}
{"text":"Scratch this place off your list! Unsure what's worse: Scratch's ambiance, service, or food quality. A French ex-photographer opened this restaurant and you would think it would match Parisian cafes or at least other local restaurants in quality of service & food.. The bad: situated on a concrete base, with no added plants/lights/other outdoor accessories AND no music it felt like we dined in the middle of an empty parking lot. The ugly: stale bread, cheap ingredients (arugula as side for both hummous and burger, store fries), thick balsamic vinaigrette, burgers not cooked to our preference (why ask?), tiny plastic cups for water (we are not toddlers). Worse yet- our server was wearing the filthiest uniform & dirty sneakers one might wear to mow the lawn on Sundays, our food arrived 20 min AFTER the table next to us got theirs (of course they sat down 10mins AFTER us, do the math), and our drink orders went through 3 servers before ending up on our table. Will not come again and will warn fellow downtowners from trying this mess out!"}
{"text":"They are one day away from their First Friday 'hard' opening and this is the best they could do? Fifteen bucks for a burger and fries I've happily paid many times at many places, but here? Not so happy.

I was warned they have gotten off to a horrid start, but didn't want to believe that precious Scottsdale place can't figure out hipster downtown Phoenix.

I called when I got out of the Jeff Speck talk over by City Hall and got hung up on in the middle of asking whether they do takeout.

So I rode my bike there anyway to find out how supremely busy they must have been on a glorious Thursday night to hang up on a takeout order.  6 tables out of 22+ have guests, dealt with by two wait staff, with two other staff wandering around and two cooks on duty.

Two strikes already - but wait! It's goes on! The cashier was too busy to even speak with me for about 4 minutes. I never could figure out what she was doing.

So I ordered a cheeseburger from this \"French Bakery\" - note that is IS NOT a \"Boulangerie\" - with fries to go. She just looked at me and said \"is that all?\". I said \"yes\" and she looked disappointed. After a few seconds, she asked \"Don't you want bacon and mushrooms?\". I thought maybe saying \"yes: might get the order processed. I was right. So I asked how long it would take. Was told \"10 minutes\". Which seemed slightly quick, even though nothing was being cooked in that moment.

So I came back 10 minutes later and sat around for 5 minutes, eventually noticing two little boxes over by the cashier, who was chatting away at another employee. So I waited 60 seconds before going over to find out whether the little boxes were my order. She stopped chatting long enough to put the boxes in a bag and hand the bag to me.

I've seen greasy spoon short order cooks fork a par-cooked hunk of meat out of some liquid slop and slap it on a grill. This burger tasted like that. I noticed a few little squiggles of something that could have been mushrooms, and a few flakes of something that could have been bacon bits.

I only had to bike 4 blocks home. The food was luke warm. At least the fries taste better lukewarm than McDonalds fries do.

But that re heated burger - not good. It does something to the texture of the meat.

There is serious competition in downtown Phoenix now. This place is not ready to succeed here."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Independence, \"Scratch\".   Everything hand made!  Here for lunch from subbing at Independence.  Very good and reasonable$."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and coffee any day except Sunday!  My favorite meal is the salmon Benedict, which I get every time with a French press coffee that is exceptional!"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews. I hate it hate it hate it. But I really have only one good thing to say about this place. 
Its in a great location and the patio will be awesome in the cooler weather. 
As for the rest of the experience it was simply awful. 
Before I start on the food, I have to complain about the service. All the servers help out with all the tables which usually works out but in this case it just meant that no one owned any table and everyone was left to languish. It took 40 minutes for our food to come. Our drinks were empty for 10 minutes at a time, several times. The coup de grace came while I was already getting irritated and the waiter walked to the end of the table while we were eating, exclaimed \"pardon my reach\" leaned in and reached past two of us to the opposite end of the table to pick up a napkin ring. When I said 'really/\" he said \"I SAID pardon my reach!\". Classless. Walk around to the other end of the table. Its not that far. 
Three of us dined and ordered different items. 
A companion ordered the breakfast sandwich which is served on a croissant but since they were out of croissants they had to substitute a very bready mealy bread. Its a french cafe and they were out of croissants. Let that roll around in your head awhile. He didnt finish it. it was awful. 
I ordered the Eggs Benedict. It was served on toasted baguette. Toasted so hard that if I wasnt so strong I wouldn't have been able to cut it. Chewing it was another problem altogether. I found it greasy and flavorless. The potatoes that came with it were of the crispy chunky frozen food variety. 
Our third companion ordered the savory crepes with goat cheese and ham. This comes with a side salad. A side salad. Really. He enjoyed the crepes but was left hungry. 

The quote that sums up the experience came on the way to the car \"The best thing about that restaurant is the food is so bad we can now go get frozen yogurt!\". 

My advice, train your staff or hire new ones. Have more than two cooks on a Sunday Brunch. Order enough food so that you don't run out of the staples. Re-evaluate your menu and dishes. 

Best of luck, I hope you make some changes and can pull this off."}
{"text":"This little corner really has poop service but they are brand new so in time im sure it will be much better. 

The fries are ridiculously good. I got the bison burger sub kobe beef with an egg and it was pretty damn good. 

Great selection of craft beer 

Will come back again for sure. 

Get better servers or train the ones that are there to be prompt and not forgetful. Our guy was flustered beyond believe with 5 tables. The music could be better too. I still give it 4 stars though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch about 1:00 on a Friday.  
Parking in front in a little lot.  
A smaller place, maybe about 13 tables (mostly 4 seaters and a few 2 seaters).

They were busy but there was a table for us and we didn't have to wait.  Our server was nice.  Everything was timely considering how busy they were.   

I believe they are only open till 3.  We could have gotten breakfast, but my hubby and I decided on lunch items.  

First I'll start with the coffee is good.
I got the chicken tacos. These were really good, but only after I asked for a bowl to put them in.  They make their own soft taco shell, and that I did not care for.  Dry, tasteless and a texture I didn't like. But, with that said, after I put the insides of the tacos in a bowl and mixed it up, it was very good(personally, I think they should just serve it naked in a bowl and ditch the shell!).  Came with a side of tortilla chips and tomato salsa which was fresh and yummy.  And yes, I would come back and order the chix tacos again!   

My hubby got the burger.  I know it had bacon on it but not sure what else.  It was really good!  Perfectly cooked.  Seasoned well.  Juice dripping the way it ought to be.  Homemade Fries were good(ask for vinegar-mmmmm). 

Can't wait to come back and try other items.  I think next time the biscuits & gravy will get in my belly!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but it was a one and done for us. Been there won't be back. 

Pros
1. Open room concept 
2. Feels spacious
3. Clean
4. Food was good

Cons
1. No apple juice
2. No chocolate milk
3. No children's menu
4. Pricey 
5. Nothing comes with anything. Like no meat with pancakes and I had omelet which was just an omelet on , but leaving and paying $47 for breakfast is crazy!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Independence's central location, it's a great place to meet friends from both sides of the river. If you venture off Rockside Road, you'll find a gem of a restaurant called Scratch. They serve breakfast and lunch, and as the name implies, most everything is made from scratch. Both the restaurant and the menu are small but cozy. Scratch is a tasty spot for an early weekday meal and perfect for Saturday brunch.

Don't miss their decadent pancakes! These will have you coming back again and again. Thankfully the tiramisu pancakes are a regular menu item. Served with a coffee liquor reduction flavored syrup, chocolate ganache and vanilla mousse, these could easily stand in for dessert. Pro tip: order your toppings on the side so the fluffy pancakes don't get soggy. 

Look for other flavors like chocolate peanut butter, cinnamon roll and pumpkin roll on the specials menu. I wish they offered more varieties as every day options - blueberry or pecan would be easy and tasty additions to the regular menu. You can also satisfy your sweet tooth with bread pudding french toast and strawberry shortcake waffles. All come with your choice of homemade sausage patty or pork belly. If you don't like your sausage smokey, choose the pork belly.

Latke Sliders from the lunch menu are a fun riff on a reuben that has potato pancakes standing in for the traditional rye bread with corned beef in thick slices (a little too thick maybe) and cheese melted overtop. 

One of my favorites is the \"Don't Call It...Corned Beef Hash.\" Potato boxty and corned beef are topped with green peppers, onions and two sunny side up eggs.

Some other things to try are the fresh made chicken fingers, El Cubano and the Scratch Burger with grilled onions, pork belly, cheddar cheese and a whiskey glaze.

The only thing I ever ordered that I didn't like was the Smokehouse Burrito (smoked pulled pork, potatoes, cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs and salsa verde.) While it sounds like a total winner, the pork was too plentiful and so smokey it overwhelmed the burrito and it desperately needed some contrasting flavors, crunch and a zippier sauce. Even some lime on the side would have helped. To make things worse, at the time I ordered this, they didn't offer any hot sauce - this situation has thankfully been remedied with the addition of Tabasco, Sriracha and Chulo.

Pros:
Locally owned and homemade food
Swoon worthy pancakes
Coffee - both drip and french press
Taco Tuesday - 2 for $5

Cons:
Closed on Sunday
French fries
Smoked meats are a bit too smokey"}
{"text":"First time here and it was very good food. Tried the Sausage biscuits and gravy and the Corn beef breakfast. Both yummy! Staff very friendly. Coffee is very good."}
{"text":"Place is great. Takes a little while to get food out but worth it. Everything is prepared with care. Prices are reasonable and food is awesome. Will be back anytime I pass during breakfast hours!"}
{"text":"A cute little place with great quality breakfast and lunch items. The service was friendly, and the place is decorated sort of modern meets farmhouse. It was clean and they have high chairs to accommodate babies. We would come back!"}
{"text":"Scratch has some of the best breakfast around, why then 3 stars? I've been here several times, and the food is delicious and flavorful. One of my favorites was the Puddin French toast that came with a bourbon syrup, just amazing! However on my last visit I realized the syrup was changed to a blueberry moonshine syrup (I'm guessing from complaints from weaklings that the bourbon syrup was too strong tasting) that was so disappointing and had almost no blueberry flavor. Also the service was not good. The young blonde waitress was always wonderful, but my waitress this time was older, frazzled by the crowd and not good at her job. It really bothered me that she brought out peoples drinks, sat them on my table, walked back into the kitchen, then came out and took the drinks to the customers!  I'll come back again for sure, but maybe take out is the way to go."}
{"text":"I won't go back. Extremely noisy - chaotic atmosphere. Not the type of environ where I pay $2.95 for a cup of coffee. Wait staff curt.  The mushroom and spinach/cheese omelette was good - fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tacos and husband had the cubano. Food was excellent!  Service was the best, as well!  So glad we saw this on Yelp and decided to try it. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Service is bad & slow. It took 10 minutes after sitting to get our drink orders taken (only 5 tables with patrons). In fact, while we were waiting for breakfast one patron simply walked out after having ordered. I sat near the open kitchen area, I observed the staff. I saw the waitress move toast on the plate with her bare hands - Wash Much?  The hash browns were good & my wife enjoyed her omelette.  Big problem with the crepes.  The crepes came from the kitchen burned on the edges.  To his credit the cook noticed me flaking off the burnt edges and offered to make us another crepe to go.

I would have given 2 stars because it has great potential but I had to take 1 back because of the service."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is on point. Had the burrito and I was not disappointed. Flavorful pulled pork, scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, all wrapped in a crisp tortilla. Topped with salsa verde and creme fraiche (now that's an added touch). 

Limited crowd at the time so my service was fast and prompt. Coffee was hot and bold. Can't complain here. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really appreciate Scratch because there's a serious lack of local, non-chain spots in this area and they deeply fulfill part of that need. The inside is really cool, with seating that flows into the open concept kitchen. They have markers and people can write on the walls (super brave!) as well as photo-worthy SCRATCH letters on the wall.

I'm super easy to please. As in, I pretty much like everything. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The sausage gravy had a rich, creamy flavor that was good enough to eat alone. The biscuits were pretty tough. On biscuits and gravy, I like the biscuits flaky and easy to cut with the gravy. Honestly, I was so tired from a long morning, and the restaurant was packed, I didn't bother sending it back and simply ate around it. This is mostly because I didn't want to wait on it; also, I hate wasting food.

The service was strange. When we told our server this was our first visit and we were excited, she said, \"That's fine.\" We felt like we were annoying her and she diluted our energy. We were asking all the questions. Meanwhile, behind us, there was a wonderful server who was telling her table about the specials, talking about the story of the restaurant and being super cool. We were eavesdropping!

Overall: I might come back, but I'm not rushing back. I will probably try something different from the menu."}
{"text":"This is an example of failure to execute at the level of expectation. We were very excited to read the menu, everything sounded incredibly enticing and unique. 

What we discovered though was that the descriptions were far more inspired than the actual food. 

The latka sliders were nothing more than corned beef on a bed of hash browns. The strawberry shortcake pancakes were nothing more than strawberry topped pancakes. The tiramisu pancakes were basically chocolate drizzled pancakes with no coffee flavor. The sausage biscuits and gravy were cold and congealed. Even the grilled cheese sandwich was missing the buttery crust that you would expect. The side salad was full of slimy greens. 

The service also left much to be desired. The waitress was rough and bordered on rude. The only reason why this place gets 3 stars is that the value was good- and the quantity of food was plentiful. 

$36 fed a group of 5 of us. It's a good concept and I hope they do well."}
{"text":"The Menu is very limited and so is the seating. The food took an excessive amount of time to come out and the waitress took 25 minutes to get 6 glasses of water.. and then never asked anyone for refills."}
{"text":"From GREAT to REALLY BAD in three quick visits.

2nd Visit:

Last week I ordered the Egg Benedict and the english muffin was ROCK HARD. Like \"chip your tooth\" hard. How this got put on a plate is beyond me! Completely in-edible. The service was soo bad I never had the chance to talk to a server, I just paid and left.

3rd Visit:

But that English Muffin was nothing compared to yesterday morning's breakfast sandwich which was tasty as all get out ... only one problem. 

I SERIOUSLY NEARLY DIED AFTER EATING IT!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS SICK IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! 

I've never had food poisoning ... Hell, I'd never gotten sick from eating anything, anywhere. But yesterday I woke up, got dressed and walked to Scratch (I did nothing else). By the time I walked home I was doubled over in SEVERE pain. I laid in bed for the entire day. I really should have gone to the hospital, it was that bad. Instead I was writhing in pain for EIGHT HOURS until I started puking up that breakfast sandwich. Two hours of puking it up, I was \"stable\". Naturally this is typical, but it was my experience.

And now, all that I can think of is how lucky that couple was, whom after 20mins of being ignored by the staff, they just up and left without ordering (this is COMMON! THEY ARE DREADFULLY UNDERSTAFFED!!!!!). The servers are great ... just nowhere near enough of them! It's a complete fail! And it's been happening regularly ever since they opened a few weeks ago!


1st Vist:

Located on 5th Street and Roosevelt right smack dab in the middle of the Arts District.  

Outdoor seating/patio with a great view of Downtown.

The dinning room has table and barstool seating with an ultra modern motif.

And I just had the best omelet in my life. 
Not kidding.
My drip coffee was hot, strong and smooth (I loved it)."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at scratch. Party of 5 on a Saturday morning. Wait was amazingly short. Good service and great food. We had both savory (omelet, breakfast burrito) and sweet (waffles, bread pudding French toast). And we are picky brunch people. My 20 something kids enjoyed graffiti-ing the walls, throwback to the days of crayons and coloring placemats."}
{"text":"If I could be a superhero, I would be Wonder Woman. Why?

1. An invisible plane. 
2. Bullet deflecting bracelets. 
3. Lasso of truth. 

Today, I'm pulling out the lasso of truth and roping in Scratch. 

I was excited, as a Yelper, to eat here. Good name, location was perfect for our activities, and the food looked good (online). 

It's in a nondescript strip building and the signage is weak, so you gotta look carefully. 

It's a small place, brightly lit with fluorescents. Inside, great signage! Cool signage. They should put some of it outside. 

He ordered biscuits and gravy and I ordered the burrito. 

When it came out, it looked amazing! Our server was sweet and friendly.

The salsa verde (tomatillo) on top of the burrito, had no real flavor. I had to salt and pepper my burrito and halfway through, if you want the truth, I got bored. I took half home and gave it to the dogs. Not because it tasted BAD but because it had no real taste and thoughts of reheating/eating it...well, that held no appeal. 

My breakfast partner (he would be Batman) actually asked for a taste of the gravy before ordering. I had some as well. At first taste, the gravy was good. Creamy, rich and sweet. We nodded with approval, and he ordered the sausage and gravy biscuits. 

Three sliders, topped with the gravy. 

Same thing happened. The biscuits and sausage had no real seasoning...so with the mellow, sweet gravy- it got boring.  He made it halfway through and said he was not impressed. Exact words, \"this got old\". 

No dish, if seasoned correctly, should get old. 
Someone in the kitchen needs to get another tongue tester in there.  This place has potential. But the food needs some BAM - POW- ZAP added to it. It wouldn't take more that a few fresh herbs and seasonings to quickly elevate this place to a 3/4 star. 

The lasso of truth has been released."}
{"text":"All there food is made from scratch, hence the name. Breakfast all day, the lunch is good too. Everything I've ever had here I loved."}
{"text":"Always exciting to see a new local breakfast/lunch spot in the area. Atmosphere is hip and fun. Wood and metal tables and a semi open kitchen. It feels spacious and not like you're sitting on top of anyone,  which is important. The menu is creative, with a mix of sweet and savory options. I tried the biscuits and gravy which were very tasty and a generous portion. The only thing that would have made it better was if the sausage was more crumbled instead of in a patty, because it was very dense. My sister had the breakfast burrito which was massive and had tons of flavor. But it is rare for me to meet a burrito I don't like. I'm intrigued by the Tiramisu pancakes on the menu and plan to try them next. Service was very friendly and seemed to run smoothly for only being open a week. My breakfast w/ side of eggs and coffee left me stuffed for $11. Not bad at all. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sketch is a new place in the city of Independence. You want might want to check the street address the first time you go there because it could easily be overlooked.  But you won't have a hard time after that, and you will be happy to come back again and again. The restaurant is very creative and features many locally sourced foods. It is only open for breakfast and lunch but that makes morning wonderful. Especially good is the Cuban sandwich, and all of the breakfast dishes are worth getting out of bed for. Because it is so small the owner/chef often comes out and make small talk with the customers. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable. The prices are fair. This is exactly what the city of independence needed to give it some flavor and a reason for people to come here."}
{"text":"The service here is quite slow, so if you're starving and want something fast, you probably should go to some fast food joint because you definitely can't rush beauty on a plate.  They only had 2 servers on the floor while the place began to fill up.  People sure do love this place because it got pretty busy at 8am on a Saturday morning.  I was kind of disappointed with the service because our server kept ignoring me when I asked for hot sauce.  I asked her 3 times but she either kept \"forgetting\" or \"didn't hear me\" even though she looked at me dead in the eyes and nodded.  Another reason why customer service was a bit upsetting was because she served everyone else their food while one of my family members had to wait an extra 15 minutes before she was given her food.  It would be nice if everyone's plate was served at the same time or at least within minutes of each other.

Some items on their menu are amazing and others need some more seasoning.  I had the country fried steak and added a side of eggs.  This meal was outstanding!! The country fried steak was a little different than what I'm used to but the seasoning was perfect in every bite.  The potatoes were different as well with a crispy outside and a deliciously moist center.  The cornbread that was served with this meal was very bland and dry.  It was very difficult for me to eat this because I felt like each bite sucked up all my saliva, which made it very difficult to swallow.

The pudding French toast was delicious! It goes very well with the French press coffee.  They went crazy with the blueberry toppings, but I'm definitely not mad.  Everything about this dish was packed with flavor!

The pulled pork burrito was impressively huge!  I was hoping that this item was going to be my go to on the menu next time I come here, but it was completely bland.  We asked for picante sauce, but unfortunately they didn't have it.  Picante sauce taste amazing with any type of breakfast burrito so I was disappointed when they didn't have it.

The french press coffee was definitely a nice touch.  Even though the coffee smelled amazing, the coffee beans inside there wasn't above average.

This place is very cute and has quite a bit of options to choose from.  I would definitely come back again to try something else on their menu because I know they have great potential."}
{"text":"Scratch always has prompt service and fantastic food. It is all made from scratch hence the name and is all inventive. I have only gone for breakfast because it is the only time of day that I can make it there. 

As a vegetarian the restaurant is very accommodating. Almost all of their breakfasts come with either pork belly or sausage and whenever I tell them to give me the meal without meat they have always automatically offered to give me potatoes instead. It's a win win!

Overall it is definitely my favorite place to get breakfast that isn't all the way in Cleveland. If you are looking for new and creative breakfast foods hit this place up!!"}
{"text":"Old school diner feel with modern ambience. Delicious French Press coffee and delectable food options. You'd think with the restaurant being in Independence that it might cost a pretty penny for a meal; however, the menu is moderately priced and you get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Delicious food. Pretty loud inside but cute decor. Chilly with the door opening and closing on a winter day. Do accept military discount!"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast and ordered smokehouse burrito that was good in quantity as well as quality. The pork had nice smoky flavour to it. We also ordered 4 egg omelete with veggies which was nice with a different flavour. The place was crowded when we went and had to wait for 30 min that was worth it. One more thing I wanted to try was their best seller tiramisu pancakes that looked great."}
{"text":"First visit here, on a gray rainy November morning.  Small, tidy space.  The tiramisu pancakes w/ pork belly were delicious.  Good coffee and OJ.   Small menu with some tasty sounding dishes...will definitely be back.  Reminds me of Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I liked quite a bit in Phoenix when I lived there."}
{"text":"So Ginger O and I went there for brunch.  We were the only ones there and it took probably 30+ minutes to get our food.  I got Eggs Benedict which didn't have any hollandaise sauce on it however the waitress gave the excuse that it was the \"French\" way...ummm to say it includes hollandaise sauce then making it invisible on your plate? The eggs were over cooked.  It was really hot in the restaurant. The service was bad, took forever for the food and they just didn't seem to care.  Then I found out the next day, Scratch closed. But that is no excuse for the bad service, go out with a bang..not a \"lame\" attitude.   Obviously we will not be going back."}
{"text":"If you love bad service this is the place for you !


We went for breakfast and stood in the doorway for about 3 min with no one acknowledging us so we did not know if we should seat ourselves or not, so we did. After about 5 minutes the waitress came over and brought us water. There were two glasses and three people. A few minutes later another table sat next to us with two people. She brought them water and then took their drink order. She still had not taken our drink order though. We sat about another 5 minutes and then the owner walked by and said hello and asked if we were ok and we said yes that we were just waiting for our server.In the meantime we were watching everything happening around us. There were exactly 7 tables of customers (2 of which had already gotten their food) There were 3 servers on duty and they all looked like they had not served a day in their lives. They walked around looking frazzled the whole time we were there.There were dirty tables when we arrived and when we left approximately 45 - 60 minutes later the same tables were still dirty. When I say that there were 7 tables of customers I mean that there were 7 tables total in that time that we were there so it is not like they were slammed and could not get to them

After waiting 15 minutes, and literally having to stare a hole through the waitress, she finally came to our table, with no apology and took our drink order. we asked her to take our food order then too. She came with a tiny piece of paper, nothing really to write on. My friend ordered no hollendaise sauce but his order came with it. My daughter ordered no salad and she got a salad (she doesnt like to waste food). The waitress never came to check on us. She only asked how everything was while she was taking the dirty plates from the table.

The food was good but the service was some of the worst I have ever experienced in my life. Its unfortunate but I will never go back and the two people I was with said the same thing. Another thing that bothered me being a former restaurant owner is the amount of time that some of the food sat in the \"window\" before the waitstaff took it out. They have no actual window, and no heat lamp. Because the waitstafff is so unorganized I watched them walk by food many times while it sat there and died a slow death. I imagine that they will have an issue with flies settling on the food as it lingers there being ignored.

Someone really needs to train the waitstaff and do it quickly.I could easily have waited on every person in that place by myself.  There is simply no excuse for that much bad service. One or two issues, okay, but when it starts out bad from the minute you walk in and gets progressively worse, well thats a wake up call for the owner.

With that said the waitress did give us a 10% discount when we voiced our concerns to her. Although I appreciate that, it suggests to me that this is the norm and since she did not have to clear it with anyone she is either the manager (which is very frightening) or they have to discount so many meals that they dont need approval to do so."}
{"text":"Incredible bread pudding French Toast and my son requested an amazing omelette concoction that was cooked to perfection .... service top notch and so friendly .. owner a NYC gal .. nothing better !!!"}
{"text":"Having just returned from Manhattan for business (where the bar for food is REALLY high), My coworkers and I found ourselves craving breakfast somewhere that would actually meet our standards. Scratch went way above and beyond what we expected. 

Over half a potato came in the American Classic. The pork belly was expertly seasoned. Real scrambled eggs were had. I almost never finish my toast, and their multi-grain toast was so good I finished it all. My coworker's words on the Corned Beef were \"beef is tender and flavorful, peppers provide an aromatic aroma, and the boxty was crunchy yet fluffy\". My other coworker's words on the Smokehouse Burrito - \"Its the size of my face\".

Also, The head chef and team at Scratch definitely have a knack for customer service, you will be treated well here. 

Working right on Rockside rd makes this the perfect place to grab breakfast before or for morning meetings. 

I wish Scratch all the best!"}
{"text":"My son and I found ourselves in Independence and wanted to try out the newly opened Scratch. So glad we did! From the French press coffee to my Smokehouse Breakfast  Burrito and Strawberry Shortcake Waffles.......perfection. Our waitress said most everything was made from scratch (including house-smoked meats) and it defiantly tasted like it. Eat here and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I went here on election day, between voting and going to work.  I had tiramisu pancakes with sausage and green tea to drink.

I swear, it had to be only about 5 minutes before my food came out.  The gentleman was very friendly and seemed happy to be there.  The food was delicious, and I timed it perfectly-- it got pretty busy shortly after I got there, and the people who came in seemed to be regulars, and raved to each other about things they've had there in the past."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star, it was so terrible. The only positive thing I can say, is that the place itself is cute inside. My excitement over the decor quickly vanished when the waitress that came to our table was covered in dog hair and her long blonde hair was also all over her. I have a lot of hair so I understand the struggle, but I'm also not serving food like that. I still ordered despite wanting to already walk out at that point. I ordered the bread pudding French toast, which sounded unique and exciting. They had so much opportunity to make that an amazing dish, not like any other breakfast place. Well, it came out and looked like burnt meatloaf, the presentation was absolutely the worst. I cut into it with my fork and could barely get through it because it was so tough, I took a bite and spit it right back out because of how unbelievably dry it was. I also bit into the sausage and smoked doesn't even begin to describe how Smokey it actually was, so be prepared. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu pancakes, the only positive thing I can say about those is that they were somewhat fluffy, so I guess they can cook a pancake but, it by no means tasted anything like tiramisu, it was more like   Nutella pancakes. The worst part of the whole thing, is I'm pretty sure the owner or some manager was there walking around the whole time, and it's a small place so she for sure noticed I was eating nothing while my girlfriend had something and chose to say nothing to me. I would not have ordered anything more, but acknowledgment might have been classier than ignoring me. Also, after looking up previous reviews and pictures of what I ordered, my dish looked NOTHING like anyone else's that's ever ordered the bread pudding French toast so clearly they lack consistency among everything else that's missing from this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, knowledgeable/friendly staff, outstanding food and prices! If you love finding cool local hot spots that know how to treat their guest, look no further. I will be back to try more of their unique meals!"}
{"text":"Theres a lot of good slections on the menu you just cant go wrong. Not a lot of filler, just a small well thought out menu. certainly a place to return to. We got there at a good time so the wait was only a few minutes. The staff is friendly and came around more than a few times to check on us or refill the drinks."}
{"text":"Wow. We were totally blown away with our breakfast here! My husband and I stopped in for brunch on our honeymoon roadtrip and immediately loved the place. The decor is very neat, and they let you sign the walls! We left our mark! Then the food! Very vegetarian & pescatarian friendly which was awesome. I had the tiramisu pancakes (omg yum) with their house made sausage patties. My husband grabbed the salmon Benedict with a side of hash browns. Damn those potatoes were amazing. We were \"yumm\"ing nonstop during and after our meal ... still are days later!"}
{"text":"So, went back again today and everything stands from what I wrote yesterday. My wife had the waffles again (I'd say she likes them) and I blew pretty much my entire week's carb allotment on their Bread Pudding French Toast. Holy wowsers, that's some seriously tasty stuff. 

Look, it's simple: We're going to get there as often as we can. I want to try pretty much their entire menu. 

Oh, they're open only until 3 but they are doing a Fish Fry this Friday starting at 4. By the looks of the fish plates I saw coming out of the kitchen, it's going to be fantastic. 

Scratch is the real deal."}
{"text":"Took my kids on a teacher work day and - at least on a weekday - there was no wait. The food was absolutely fantastic. My son had the special, pumpkin pancakes, while I had the enormous and very tasty breakfast burrito... or half of it, anyhow. My husband enjoyed the other half as leftovers. My daughter was thrilled with the kids' waffle. She's nine and it was more than enough food. I tried a bit of both of you kids' meals and honestly everything was well worth coming back for. The restaurant is small and I imagine it would be quite busy at peak hours on the weekends, but it's a nice atmosphere and the service is fast. They do take American Express too, which is nice. Overall my only complaint was that the server didn't ask if I wanted a refill on my coffee. We all left full and happy and the price was reasonable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Shame on me for not reading the description better but the corn beef hash was not at all what I expected. Strips of corn beef not the crumbles over top of peppers and onions like a fajita or something. I did read it was over a boxty not has browns which was fine but not enough potato in my opinion. We had a side of hashbrowns which were undercooked. The service was incredibly slow. If you plan to go give yourself over an hour.  I had to flag someone down to refill our water.  The only thing going for them was that the decor was great."}
{"text":"I went to Scratch yesterday with my coworker. We had heard good things so we were excited to try it. It is small and inside a little strip plaza. The decor is pretty basic and they let people write on the walls. You seat yourself and a server comes over. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and pudding French toast and split them. The biscuits were good, but not the best I've ever had. Our order was also missing an entire biscuit. The homemade sausage patty on top wasn't fully cooked either. The pudding French toast was very tasty and came with a side of bacon."}
{"text":"Would have been great had there not been plastic inside of my waffle. Food actually tasted great, but the foreign object in my food was enough to bring the review down to just one star. Sorry scratch. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This wasn't what I expected at all. With a name like Scratch, I was expecting a cute little bakery, not a French bistro (I'm not complaining, just stating my opinion).
I came here on a whim. I didn't even realize it was open yet and as soon as I did I slammed on my brakes and cut across a lane of traffic to get there. (My apologies to the silver Dodge Charger that I cut off)
I got there at 5 PM this past Tuesday and the place was absolutely dead. Other than the server/hostess/cashier person, I was the only one there.
The server was very sweet, friendly, poite, went over the menu with me since I had never been there before. I ordered the Kobe-style Wageyu burger with fries, a chocolate mousse cake with strawberry puree on top and bought a bottle of blueberry/lavender jam.
The burger and fries were really really good and reasonably priced.
The dessert was delicious, but approximately $7.50. Was a bit on the pricey side.
The jam is pretty awesome, but $8.50. Granted its a big jar, but I would like something half the size. Its all fresh, no preservatives, and living by myself, I'll probably only get through maybe half the jar before it goes bad. A jar half the size for $5 would be perfect.

Pros: Service, location, parking lot (in Downtown Phx, this is definitely a pro), great burgers, cute restaurant.

Cons: I could order the lunch burger which was a burger and salad, or the dinner which was a burger, salad and fries at a more expensive price. Well, I only wanted burger and fries. I had a salad for lunch and didn't want another salad. So I had to order the dinner (burger salad and fries) and she gave me extra fries instead of the salad. So I got a burger and a crap-load of fries. I didn't want a crap-load of fries. I wanted a normal size portion. So half the fries went in the trash after I was done. Just let me order a damn burger and fries without charging me extra (that goes for you too Fez)
The bakery side - nothing was labeled, no names, descriptions or prices and I felt bad for asking the server to tell me what everything was. Sorry!! But I really didn't know what I wanted and I didn't want to go just with what looked pretty.
The server handed me the menu and immediately listed the three things they didn't have. My first thought was no big deal, its a new restaurant, maybe they don't know what the demand for certain items would be. However, I was told they were out because those items weren't in season (escargot for starters). Well, if it's not in season, take it off the menu. Create seasonal menus so your servers don't have to constantly list the items that aren't available. As a customer I would much rather have the server tell me what they do have (like specials) than what they don't have. It sets a negative tone for the meal. Just my humble opinion.

So yes, my \"cons\" sections is long, but it was really an enjoyable experience. Good food, good service.

I will definitely be back. I want to hit them up for breakfast this weekend"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, a lot of choices. I ordered the signature pudding french toast and my husband got fried steak. The food does taste homemade,from the blueberry dressing to the vanilla cream, every ingredient tastes better and fresher from what you got from the grocery stores. Just one comment that the steak gravy is a bit salty for us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolute amazing!  Every time I go there, I've tried something different and each item has just about left me speechless.  Literally, it's just THAT good.  
I've been there for breakfast more than lunch.  So far my favorites are the puddin' French toast and the breakfast burrito.  But their version of corned beef hash was incredible as well.  The staff is great even when the place is bustling, and there is a welcoming atmosphere you can't find everywhere.  
This is my go-to place when I get a rare morning off.  Triple thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very good but if it's packed it's gonna be a while..... maybe the a la carte portion could of been better... but that's bout it..... tasted great though.... maybe you Kats hook up with my home girls at pork chop shop at west side market and the a la carte portions will be nicer bwhahahahahahaa"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The staff is very pleasant and the food is delicious. I have only had a few items but the pancakes are great. The burrito is very good as well."}
{"text":"Terrific breakfast, awesome food and service. 
I had the veggie omelette and side of potatoes."}
{"text":"The bread pudding French toast is to die for.  Very good food.  Cute place great location.  Wish it was open for Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"I had heard of Scratch through the grapevine, but had decided not to try it because I was hearing about it from vegetarian-type friends. I usually don't care for their hippie food and the name Scratch sounded like one of their \"it's a hamburger made out of a mushroom\" type places. 

I'm glad, however, that I gave it a swing. In fact, I keep swinging - I was there today in fact...and Tuesday....and last Wednesday. 

Far from the bean sprout haven that I had expected, Scratch smokes their own pork for their Smokhouse burrito and their own pork belly for the BTL. WHAAAA?! Yes, you heard that correctly. 

Their take on the famous Kentucky Hot Brown as a soup is to die for. It is to the point where the staff just bring me the soup upon arrival because, sooner or later, that stuff is going to make it's way to my table. 

The salads are huge and fresh. 

The chicken tacos can be found on house-made tortillas. 

The burger, with the house-smoked pork belly and friend onions, is supurb.

I had yet to try their breakfast yet, but the menu contains crazy things like...

Tiramisu Pancakes

Bread Pudding French Toast

French Press

And the Strawberry Shortcake Waffle


The food - awesome.

Secondly, the staff is incredible. I can't say enough about the wait staff, their helpfulness, and the speed of service. 

All in all - excellent. Go there - eat - be happy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Came with coworkers for lunch - we had a good sampling of the menu and the consensus was everything was great. 

I had the latke sliders and hot brown soup. Both were very tasty and the portion was huge. 

We also had am omelette, a salad, a Cuban sandwich, and a blt. Fries were on point...and they just offered us some fried Oreos, to finish us off. 

Not too shabby, guys. 

And I spent about $12 (pre-tip, water to drink). 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this new breakfast place with my sister today.  It's exciting to see a trendier place like this open in the burbs.  Usually for this type of atmosphere and menu,  we're hiking down to Jack Flaps or Bon Bon.  For only being open a week,  everything ran smoothly.  Service was friendly,  the dining area was spacious and bright.   I had the breakfast burrito, which was very flavorful.  I could only get through half of it because it was so filling.  I found it very inexpensive - only $11 for the burrito and coffee, and I left with a to-go box for lunch later.  I'm curious if they will add new menu items or specials later after they are open a while longer.   Their menu is limited,  which tends to be a good sign because usually that means the place will be very good at all items.   But in the other hand,  having such a limited selection may not make me come back as much because a few of the items aren't to my taste.   For example: I don't care much for tiramesu or salmon, so two of the menu items I'd never order.  With less than a dozen choices,  that could be limiting.   Overall, I really enjoyed Scratch and I'm looking forward to taking my husband to try it."}
{"text":"We were in the area and both really were craving breakfast. We did a quick yelp search and it brought us to this amazing hidden gem. They have a limited breakfast and lunch menu but I like places like that because that means they usually do a great job with the few dishes they do have. We had a French press of coffee and I have to say it's better than the coffee I make at home. I usually don't like the coffee served at most restaurants but this coffee was great. I order the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the breakfast special and let me tell you I had to stop myself from eating before i got sick from overeating. The pork in the burrito had a nice smoked flavor and I loved the Chile verde sauce they serve on top of it. I didn't try much of my boyfriends food but he said it was great. This place is worth driving out of the way for. Be patient with the slower service because the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"If you like quality, get here.   Awesome menu with a little something for everyone.  I had the Country Fried Steak and not only was it incredible the potatoes are amazing and unique.  Kind of changed the way I look at breakfast potatoes.   I will def be back.   #fromscratch #ibelieveit"}
{"text":"This place was good. It was great to see that this is a new business!  The food was tasty.  The day that I went they were giving away free tiramisu,  strawberry,  or plain pancakes all day. When asked why it was just to thank the community for all their support. That was AWESOME. 

Service was 5 stars. I don't remember our server's name but she was great. I ordered the salmon Benedict and it was different. The taste was okay,  it just wasn't the traditional Benedict. It was not listed on the menu,  but it was on the wall (as a special) so I ordered it. Had I known that it wasn't going to be traditional I probably wouldn't have gotten it. So the Benedict came with the hollandaise sauce, eggs,  and of course the salmon,  but instead of the bread bedding it rested on some sort of vegetable in the cabbage family . And then under the cabbage was a bed of arugula. Like I said,  had I known it was made in a non-traditional fashion,  I personally wouldn't have ordered it. 

The pancakes were phenomenal and very filling.  In the free order they gave you three. I got the plain ones. One of the guys I was with ordered the tiramisu and said they were very good. They tasted like a dessert!  What's better than that for breakfast?  :) 

I also ordered a side of bacon but they actually brought out just a VERY crispy (almost burnt) pork belly. Not really a fan of that either. I really wanted actual bacon. Some of it was okay though. 

Overall,  I would come back to the restaurant to try something different. But this new restaurant has great potential."}
{"text":"Ok, so I know I just reviewed this place on Friday, but, as promised, I went back for breakfast and it was much better than lunch. I had the breakfast sandwich with an over medium egg. The breakfast sandwich was delicious! It is an egg, cheese, bacon, and tomato sandwich with some bechamel sauce all on a croissant. Usually the egg is like an omelet, but I asked for mine over medium. This turned out to be a total mess, but a tasty mess. I didn't like the potatoes it came with, they were dry and boring, so I left them. The salad it came with was delicious as noted before...they always have the same delicious vinegar based dressing (not 100% what kind of dressing it is....kind of like a creamy vinaigrette). The coffee is strong, but not bad. The service is still lacking, it was extremely slow....took over an hour for breakfast same as when I came for lunch. I understand the restaurant is brand new, but I hope the service improves as time goes on. Anyway, I would recommend this place for a leisurely breakfast, but probably wouldn't come back for lunch. 


Here is the copied lunch review for your viewing pleasure: 

3 stars

Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed breakfast at Scratch in Scottsdale, so I definitely need to come to this Scratch for breakfast (especially since it is 3 blocks from my apartment...woohoo!!). That said, I just got back from lunch here and it was disappointing. I went with my dad and we ordered the harmony salad and the chicken pesto sandwich to share. Unfortunately, these two items are essentially the exact same item except one is in a bowl and one is on bread (it did not sound like that was the case on the menu). I wish the server would have just given us a little warning before putting in our order as she knew we were sharing. Anyway, the salad was better than the sandwich because it had avocado and because the sandwich had their french bread, which was dry and not very flavorful. The salad dressing was very good, the pesto needed more flavor, maybe a little garlic increase. The service was fine when we got there, but we waited a LONG time for our check and for a box at the end. We were there for about an hour and a half for lunch, which is unacceptable for people who have jobs. I think most of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant is open longer, so I'm not terribly concerned about that. Also, the chairs have weird chair covers over them that make it hard to push them in and out and are awkward...not sure why those are necessary, but other than that it is a nice, clean looking restaurant. Other positives include they have a nice patio, they have the open air feel inside because some of their walls open, the salad dressing is good, the food was very fresh, the prices are far less pricey than expected, and the portion sizes are generous (the two of us could have shared the sandwich or the salad...def did not need both). I will be back to Scratch for breakfast....maybe this weekend, and will update then, but for lunch, this only gets 3 stars"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was happy with the food. I would have given 4-stars if based solely on my dinner. 

Now let's get on with the rest of the review... Management if you are reading, you HAVE to improve on service, organization and staff training. 

I understand it is a relatively new spot. But everything and everyone looked chaotic and confused. We were waiting to be seated for a while. Hostess was busy with seating another big party. So the other guy (assuming waiter) told us to sit at the corner empty table.  They have limited amount of high chairs (2 to be exact), and both were taken by the big table, which wasn't a big deal for us but may want to invest in a few more.  We were not greeted or brought any water for a while. I finally went up on my way to the bathroom just to give them a heads up, since hostess wasn't the one who seated us. 

I think during the course of dinner we had about 3-4 different people stopping by, no one knew what the other person did before.  We were given water but no one once asked about our drink preferences (upsell anyone?).  At the end some lady we never saw before brought us the wrong check... Which made me wonder: isn't the table numbered?  And why don't the staff know the table numbers then?

2 of us ordered burgers ($13 dinner price). There is a big selection of burgers. It came with fries and a little side salad. One ordered the vegan tofu salad because the little girl cannot eat meat... And the salad arrived without tofu because they ran out.  I didn't think tofu is expensive to stock, and they don't go bad that easily in the fridge. Worse is no one mentioned it until the mom asked \"where is the tofu?\"  She also ordered the French onion soup, which came with a big side salad. Personally I think the dressing looked awfully thick. I am not a salad person so I will hold my piece. 

My dinner was the grilled scallops in white wine sauce with veggies.  I found $16 to be well priced. No one in my town (Charlotte NC) offers scallops for less than $20. My other option was the curry lamb shoulder ($16 as well). and I really wish someone would have ordered it so I could taste. My scallops were perfectly cooked. Though they are not big, but I got 5 pieces. The wine sauce was divine. If anything the veggies were a little undercooked but I have a feeling it was purposely not cooked. All in all I was happy with my dinner.  They were out of escargot so I didn't get to try that either. 

This place has potential. The ambience was good, it's hip-ish yet chill.  I hope you make the necessary improvements. I would give you a 2nd chance if I live there."}
{"text":"Great presentation. Servings a little on the small side. Had the corned beef hash, not your traditional, larger slices of corned beef with bigger pieces of onions and peppers.  If you want small diner feel with a little more upscale food this is your place, will cost you a little more."}
{"text":"***I am rating from a vegetarian and customer service perspective so take that into consideration when reading my review.***

I really like Scratch. I love sitting outdoors. Phoenix is BEGINNING to feel like a CITY city.

I can empathize with others regarding not knowing what to do when you first walk in if no one greets you immediately but after the initial visit, just do your thing.

They have a tasty vegan burger which hits the spot every time. It's so not the typical thoughtless effort most non-vegetarian places do NOT put into their burgers. And omg, my tattooed (points for this) server was quick to let me know that the truffle fries are vegetarian but not vegan and offered me pesto-tossed fries instead. OMG, they were so YUM!

I really appreciate that kind of service. I personally think that the fact that it takes them a long time to come back to you is to allow you to slowly enjoy your food and the experience. I mean it's not fast food, for goodness sakes. Its French, for whatever that signifies.

I would like to see more creative vegetarian choices but I realize that that is wishful thinking and I give them kudos for the 7 vegetarian/Vegan offerings. Not many restaurants give that much thought to alternative palates unless it specializes in that type of cuisine.

Go and bring your patience."}
{"text":"What a great little gem in Independence.  A fun, eclectic place with good food.  Had breakfast this time.  All was good.  So far, two for two.  Will continue to go here when in the vicinity"}
{"text":"ugh - after a very disappointing visit in March. I was dragged in here again by a friend who really wanted to try it. I learned my lesson and didn't order the burger (see previous review). Got the breakfast burrito. It was good - I will give them that and more timely then my last experience. My friends fries were cooked in old oil so not very tasty. We had the same unfriendly waitress, I had before. She rushed about in a frantic state for no reason. No real pleasantries. She is such an absolute turn off from this place. My friend who was so excited to try this place was baffled by her \"rudeness\" attitude (another reviewer nailed it with \"short of hostile\"). There wasn't anyone waiting to be seated - but we felt she was giving everyone the \"rush\" to get out of there so they could close (?). So the 2nd time was not the charm."}
{"text":"No question the best corned beef hash I've ever had, and possibly the best that exist anywhere."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for sure. Very unassuming from the outside, but inside is cozy and clean with nice decor. Nothing fancy, but cute. Service was a tad slow but not annoyingly so.

The food was great, everyone in our party loved it. At our table it ranged from sandwiches and burgers all the way to omelets. While the menu is small, there was still plenty to choose from. I also think it's a good sign when a menu doesn't have a rambling selection because that means it's thoughtful, ie, they won't put it on unless they know how to really cook it.

I don't understand the bad reviews in terms of pricing, because I thought it was very reasonable for what you get. Also, knocking a place because they don't have a children's menu is ridiculous. Go somewhere else if you want apple juice and a mickey mouse shaped pancake. But if you actually care about the quality and taste of your food, give scratch a try!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for breakfast yesterday.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and she had the eggs florentine.  My breakfast sandwich was really quite good.  It was like a little omelet sandwich inside a croissant.  It was priced right and I would definitely order it again.  Her eggs florentine was just ok.  She would have preferred if the spinach was cut up a little bit smaller so that all of the leaves didn't come out in one bite.  The patio was a nice atmosphere, and the decor was nice, and that's why I gave it the one star that I did.  The reason I didn't give it any more stars is because the service was epically, comically bad.  Like we both wondered if we were being punk'd or something, like it was a joke.  

Our server disappeared for several minutes at a time repeatedly.  First she took our drink order and brought us our drinks and said she would be back to take our food order.  Literally 15 minutes later she finally ventured back out to the patio and took our order.  We were already a bit frustrated at that point because as soon as my girlfriend saw my coffee, she decided she wanted one, but had to wait forever just to order it.  

Our food was brought out by a different server, and right away we knew we needed some hot sauce and ketchup for our hash browns and eggs.  No one came back a few minutes later to see if we had everything we needed, which is basic serving 101.  Another 10 - 15 minutes went by and finally I just got up and went inside to track someone down.  Once we were done eating they took our plates and dropped off our check.  We put our card out to pay for the meal, but after another 20 minutes of it sitting on the corner of our table we eventually just got up and took it inside to pay.  And all the while both servers that served us were not friendly or welcoming at all.  It was like we were annoying them.  We were there for like 90 minutes, and probably more than half of that we spent just waiting for our server to come around so that we could move forward with the dining process.

I might be able to understand some of this behavior if they were slammed.  But they weren't even 1/4 full when we got there.  And part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt because they have only been open a week, but after thinking about it, no.  There is no excuse for this type of crappy service, and really it has nothing to do with how long a restaurant has been open.  

I don't know if we'll be back to give this place another try or not.  With all the great dining options in downtown, a place can't really afford to make too many bad first impressions."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure how I've never written my review for Scratch considering the frequency with which I eat here. I love Scratch and it's one of my go-to places for lunch during the workweek. It's also one of my favorite places to indulge for a weekend breakfast and a great place to catch up with an old friend. 

I love that everything here is made to order. You can tell that the folks in the kitchen love trying new things and want to ensure their food is hot, fresh, and often innovative. I've had so many dishes here that's it's hard to be specific, but some of my favorites have included their brisket mac and cheese special (that coffee jus was divine), the tiramisu packages, and the breakfast burrito. I've also enjoyed their hot apple cider, a squash special, the hot brown soup. The crispy hot potatoes that serve as the side for many dishes are also outstanding. 

The chef often steps out to ask our group how we liked everything, and it's great to see that he likes customer feedback and wants to make sure we are happy. 

The inside is quaint and suits the name of the restaurant: wood and lots of writing from customers on the wall. 

I've had a few issues at Scratch from time to time, but they're rare. I didn't care for their BLT and there have been a couple of times when a server was more curt than normal, probably due to how busy they were. There have also been quite a few times when I can't make it back to the office because lunch takes a long time to come out, but that's to be expected when things are made to order. To combat this, we try to go earlier to beat the lunch rush, and any issues I've had are honestly not enough to make me stop coming. I really like this place and hope it continues to thrive!"}
{"text":"Came here to try a local spot. This place is amazing, service excellent, decor adorable, music makes you feel at home! The food is uh-maze-ing, and the coffee--from a roaster down the road--is the best coffee that has passed these lips in a minute. We had the corned beef and some pancakes. You MUST try the potatoes (home fries). So delicious."}
{"text":"One of the reasons why I love Yelp is that the yelpers here help me find these little diamond nuggets that I otherwise would not have heard of or come across. Here is yet another one of those successful finds. This is quite a little tiny place, like a little diner, located in a very small and plain looking shopping strip. It has maybe like 7 tables and the hours are limiting (closes at 3pm each day). 

I got the salmon benedict and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Excellent presentation of both entrees. The salmon lays atop poached eggs (cooked to perfection, lots of gooey yolk drizzling the rest of the food once penetrated), a cooked root (I forgot the name of it, but it's a root almost like a yam) and everything over a plate of arugula. What a blissful marriage of flavors! The burrito seemed to be the prom king of the menu, I saw a lot of yelp people and other patrons eating it. This is maybe slightly bigger than chipotle size burrito, and houses pulled pork, cheddar cheese, hash browns and scrambled eggs! Ended up eating it like an open faced sandwich. I would have to say it was such a great value for the price.

Parking was easy, it's in a little shopping center. Not sure if the shopping strip would allow, but I think a larger sign would help drum up business or help patrons find the place.

This place is kid friendly. I thinks kids get a kick on being able to write on the walls (nope not chalkboard...actual markers on actual walls)."}
{"text":"Scratch is a nice no-frills eatery that contrasts against Independence's bustling corporate environment,which is overrun with chain restaurants. I was hesitant to stop in here because it's hard for me to convince myself to go anywhere than my standby Yours Truly whenever I'm in Independence. I went for it though, and I was pretty pleased with my experience.
 
I think the standout for me was the service. My server was really friendly, and I felt like all of the other staff were also looking out to see what customers needed. I was wavering between getting the chicken tacos and the burger, and my server assured me that they were both tasty options. In the end I went for the burger. It wasn't exceedingly big, but for $8.50 it was a generous size served alongside fries. I especially liked the thick cut bacon on top of the burger which added a lot of flavor. I typically don't like homestyle fries like the ones served here because they tend to not be crispy enough, but I didn't find that was the case here. 

The inside seems a little makeshift, it's decorated sparingly and the seating area opens up to the kitchen which may bother some people. It didn't bother me, but it definitely gave it a more casual feel. There wasn't anything here that was truly unique or exciting here, and I'm not urging folks to run over and try it, but I think given it's somewhat unique in the context of chain eateries in Independence, and the level of service, I definitely think it's worth a try if you're in the area."}
