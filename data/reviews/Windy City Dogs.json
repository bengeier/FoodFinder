{"text":"I am from Chicago and I have to say WCD has the best Italian beef sandwich I have ever had in Arizona! The Chicago dog was excellent as.well. Nice setting a little hard to find as it sits in the middle of a park (Gateway in El Mirage) and there is little signage on the road but great all the same."}
{"text":"Absolutely great with kids good food great prices and one amazing Italian beef sandwich!!! It's a must try when your at el mirage park!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and have spent years trying to find a place here on the Westside that has good Italian roast beef and to be perfectly honest with you Windy City dogs hands down has the best Italian roast beef in all of Arizona.  They use Vienna Beef and the hot Giardiniera is made by Vienna as well. The seasonings that they use in their au jus is a trade secret, I've been to Portillos I've been to lukes of Chicago I've even tried Freddy's steakburgers Italian roast beef but no one compares to Windy City dogs.  I tell all my friends from Chicago that if you want some good roast beef sandwiches Windy City dogs is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch with the kids... Food is okay, but I've had better... The hot dogs are a worthy treat, but the tamales are disappointing..."}
{"text":"Set up is near a skate park. Wasn't sure what to expect, but what a hidden gem this place is! I wish I didn't live so far away from this place. Luckily I ride my motorcycle a lot on the west side so WCD will be a mandatory stop every time I'm up that way. It was prepared perfectly. Just like the way they do back in Chicago. And the bun was perfectly steamed. That is something they don't do well everywhere else. I highly recommend this place if you want a to get a real taste of \"The Chicago Style\" Hot Dog!"}
{"text":"This a a great snack bar. My son has his baseball practices here and his games at a different park with a smaller concessions stand. I was expecting Windy Cities to be more in cost than the small stand but I was wrong. The prices are actually lower here. Which is a great surprise. They have lots more options as well. Our favorites here are the soft serve, the pixie sticks and the nachos. I have yet to try a hot dog but I eventually will. The staff is nice and helpful. Great place and its always packed with says a lot."}
{"text":"Hard to find. It's tucked behind solar panels on Cinnabar, it's not on El Mirage. It was pretty good overall!"}
{"text":"At the local Home Depot parking lot in Surprise, AZ is a basic hot dog wagon.  One might expect and get an excellent meal at Fouquets in Paris, I got what I hoped for from the WIndy City basic hot dog wagon - an excellent hot dog.  I was hungry and just wanted a good hot dog and did receive a quality, hot \"burp free' hot dog, from a clean environment with a smile. I will return. Thanks for being there."}
{"text":"I am an Italian Beef Sandwich Connoisseur! I have eaten Italian Beef Sandwiches all over the USA, including many places in Chicago. I'm giving an extreme amount of credit to Windy City Dogs for perfecting this sandwich! Fresh bread, flavorful meat, amazing Ajus, and authentic Hot Giardiniera Peppers! They have it down correct, they are spot on!! Go try one for yourself and you will see why I am an Italian Beef Addict!  PS. This little Gem of a place is OPEN UNTIL 9PM (NOT 3pm as it states on Yelp)"}
{"text":"Really good Italian beef with authentic chicago style giardiniera and au jus for dipping. Will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Great Italian Beefs ! Tamales are the Best ! Served by Dee the owner ... Can not beat the experience ! Worth the trip great Chicago style Hot Dogs ..."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly owner, and a true Chicago style dog experience. Overall great lunch or weekend drop in spot."}
{"text":"Love windy city dogs! Amazing beef and the shaved ice is delicious! Everything I've tried has been great and the customer service is always superb. Such a friendly place with great food. Perfect combination for an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Im new to yelp, Being from Chicago and now retired in Sun City. My daughter told me about this little place and said I needed to try it.  Finding good  food in the west valley has been a challenge, not anymore!  I had a hot dog and a sausage, YES!!!!! This is what brought me right back to sweet home Chicago, Windy City Dogs: Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a 4 dollar hot dog.  the bun was super delicious.  Bring your own catsup unless you want to spend 100 bucks for theirs.  lol.  Next time i want to try the brat with kraut.  That looks pretty good.  Also, \"sport peppers\", in case you're wondering, are little serrano peppers that are pickled and taste very much like pepperoncinis.    I'm betting she does a lot of early am business...  If she only made \"baja dogs\" then that'd be fantastic!!  Anyway, i'll try the brat and update my review."}
{"text":"I have made it a habit to come here every time I go to Home Depot. I love their Chicago dog and the brat with sauerkraut (don't forget the celery salt!) ! I don't agree with it being a \"basic\" stand. I have always had a good experience here and will continue to return.."}
{"text":"I had the Italian beef sandwich   It's hard to compare because they are just flat out hard to find outside Chicago.  I will say it was a bit short of being anything I would call authentic you could be disappointed if you've been to Chicago. They do however sell real authentic ingredients to make your own Chicago dogs.  Pretty much nothing more than a hot dog stand at a skate park."}
{"text":"We have tried both the Italian beef and Chicago dogs, my husband is from Chicago and picky about both.  He stated these hot dogs and Italian am beef are as good as portillos!  You gotta check out this indoor snack bar hidden gem, extremely family friendly."}
{"text":"Hot dogs where great! Staff has great customer service! Will be back for another dog and fries!"}
{"text":"Great dogs, great drinks, great people!  We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of: Jumbo Dogs, Mini Dogs, Spicy Dogs, Polish Sausages and Brawts! All of it are great!  They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers.  Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"First time trying a Chicago dog and I was not disappointed! My husband and I got a jumbo dog and a skinny dog ($2 Tuesday!) and got them Chicago style! The flavor was delicious and hot dogs juicy! We also had chili cheese fries, a tamale, fresh baked cookie and also got to try their new dessert - the shaved ice cream (not to be confused with shaved ice). We had the mango flavor and it was so soft, like snow! We will definitely be coming back to try more! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I crave Chi-town dogs and Italian beef sandwich's all the time and I keep forgetting about this place! I've gone here a few times now and never disappointed!   Friendly staff and quick service. The owner, Dee, is awesome and always a pleasure to see! Next time I'll try the meatball sub!!!"}
{"text":"Good for kids.    Windy City Dogs features Vienna Beef hot dogs. This restaurant is local, and I like  to support small businesses.  I have spent some time in Chicago and have had my fair share of hotdogs.  At Windy City dogs you can get a traditional Chicago dog on a  poppy seeded bun, peppers, pickle spear, tomato slices, fluorescent green relish ?, chopped onion, and celery salt.  Windy City Dogs offers a  variety of toppings and if you don't like beef dogs, there is Polish sausage, tamales, corndogs, nachos, and Italian beef sandwiches. On this visit I had the tamale and to be honest it was very disappointing and nothing like tamales I am accustomed to.    Prices range from inexpensive to ridiculously cheap. This is a great place to bring kids, I myself am not a hot dog fan so I am trying to be very objective.  Eat in or take out, its up to you. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I have lived in El Mirage for 3 years and have driven past Windy City Dogs everyday but never went in, I am glad I went in today! I got the Italian Beef and it was amazing. Very close to beating Luke's and is exceptionally better than Portillos! I will be back to try the Chicago Hot dog and other yummy treats here soon!"}
{"text":"My dad took me here, wow the food was great! Being in the west valley, good food is hard to find. I had the beef with peppers and a shaved ice.  One question when will my dad take me back? Next week!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal chicago style dogs. Almost like being in the Windy City, without the cold."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by for lunch for the first time and we love it. It's a cute and clean little place, playing classic oldies while you dine on fresh and juicy all-beef Vienna hot dogs (or polish, which I'll try next time cuz there will definitely be a next time ;)) in softly steamed buns. The girl behind the counter was so nice and patient (first time so we took a while to decide) and ready to ask any questions we had. She even brought our order to our table (don't know if their suppose to or not but still nice). I would have taken a picture of what I had but it didn't last long enough if that's any indication of how good it was ;)"}
{"text":"The best!!!! Very good very fresh l!! Want to go all the time! Ned to go back to try beef and meatball sub!! Shaved ice unbelievable! Pricing very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"WHAT A TREAT!  Memories of Chicago hot dog stands came to mind, followed by a treat to my taste buds with celery salt!    Dee is a wonderful hostess who knows how to prepare Chicago staple foods!    I'm coming back and telling my friends, too.  Better than Portillo's?  Hands down!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy! The staff is always so nice and excited every time we have stopped by. The Chicago dog is my favorite - try it - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and if you have ever visited the windy city you would know that the only place to get a REAL Chicago dog is from a hotdog cart. Windy City Dogs lives up to the true Chicago dog taste better than any place is the valley, so if you want the taste of a REAL Chicago dog, visit Windy City Dogs!!!!"}
{"text":"Man this place ROCKS!!! I am not from Chicago but this place is representing big time. The Spicy Polish with all the goodys and The tamale were perfect. I have to admit though when I first saw the Tamale I hesitated but the flavor and texture made it a do over for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while off and on. The food is good and the staff is friendly. The only bad thing is having to deal with rough kids that come in and out being loud and unsupervised. This place is better for take out sometimes. The meatball subs are sooooo good."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and I wasn't disappointed. Gave Yelp a quick look for hot dog places and found this wonderful place.   The staff was very friendly and courteous. The restaurant is small in size, but pretty clean.   I ordered the Maxwell Street Spicy Polish, Corn Dog, Spicy Polish, Classic Jumbo and side of fries. The Maxwell was delicious with that homemade coleslaw to go along with the crunch of the fried spicy polish dog. I've never had coleslaw on my dog before, but it was well worth it.  This is definitely worth the trip to El Mirage for these delicious dogs! Cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Good hotdogs (polish & spicy polish), good fries, great pretzels/nacho cheese, really good value and fantastic topping selection.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The lady's are always energetic and super friendly. And the dogs they're serving up are amazing and authentic Chicago! They even serve Jays potato chips! This is a must stop for a quick, delicious, and very affordable lunch."}
{"text":"I've never met someone who was so enthusiastic about selling hot dogs. The lady was so kind and made sure we enjoyed our meal! Thank you for the great meal!!"}
{"text":"Great dogs every time I come here with great friendly staff. P.S. don't believe the hours they're open till 9:00 pm every day."}
{"text":"Best Italian beef in the West Valley hands down. And they use Turano bread if you're from Chicago you know. Also the dogs are great top notch. They also just started carrying pizza puffs. Again if your from Chicago you know how an great they are. The owner is very friendly. Great atmosphere. Coming here makes me feel like im in Chicago for a bit. I love it. They even have Jays chips from Chicago."}
{"text":"Found this little hotdog place out of no where I'm glad I stopped in got a Chicago dog and in my opinion was better than portillos. I will coming back weekly. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu. The have shaved ice also."}
