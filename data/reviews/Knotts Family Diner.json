{"text":"My husband and I are big breakfast fans, so when we saw this diner on New Day Cleveland, we added it to our list of places to try.  I had an omelette with the red skin potatoes. And I was disappointed. The potatoes looked like they came from a frozen bag and they had no seasoning. And the omelette was just okay. It wasn't bad, but not great. The mushrooms were canned mushrooms which I dont like (my fault, though for not asking before I ordered). It was cooked well, not runny or gross, but definitely not memorable. Hubby had the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was excellent but the biscuits, although homemade, were a bit tough and dry -- most likely the result of being cooked earlier and being set out for a while. 

The service was very friendly, definitely a small town diner where everyone knows everyone.

I would return again though to try other menu items. Kicking myself for not getting the bacon everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"I got the starving farmer- which was red skin potatoes topped with sausage gravy and eggs your way (i got over easy) and biscuit-- the sausage gravy was amazing only problem was that my stomach wasn't big enough to eat it all! My boyfriend got the 2 eggs your way-- eggs , toast and bacon were delicious! The bacon especially because it was fresh and thick & crispy! shredded hasbrowns could of been a bit better. The stuffed french toast w/ cream cheese & chocolate chips were great and so was the service!!  Overall we definitely would return!! You can never beat your local diner! Yum!!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast after seeing the reviews on yelp. This place is a great! Great menu, food and service. I wish we would've known about this place a long time ago. My husband loved the sausage gravy. I had the corned beef and Swiss omelette. Excellent. Red potato side was good too. The bacon is good. The coffee is good. Reasonably priced. Nothing to complain about. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food & friendly service!  Enjoyed the nostalgic feeling of the place!   Coffee always on!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The Biscuits and Gravy are probably the best I have had. Family run business that specializes in good quality food and great prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not your average small town diner! 
(Please keep it that way)

The staff is always very attentive, but not to the point where you feel like you want to tell them to go away  . They have always been so accommodating to my many food allergies, I truly appreciate it. I recommend the corned beef hash, pickle fries or even the starving farmer. 

I just wish their ice cream parlor/shop wasn't as seasonal, it's simply the best you can get for miles around. Without having to drive to Fairview to get Webers, & (during winter) it beats going across the street paying 2x the amount. For subpar ice cream at Samosky's e'hem & having to eat it outside or take it home. ( they won't let you eat it inside the restaurant )"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's super clean and not greasy. The staff is really nice and the prices are very very reasonable. The only downside is there isn't a roomy waiting area."}
{"text":"I could not bear the thought of another breakfast at Bob Evans. Thankfully I found the place on yelp. The food was good and the prices are amazing. We will definitely reutrn"}
{"text":"'Where everybody knows your name...' was my first thought as I entered this small town diner today for the first time with a buddy.  Everyone looked up as we entered. It was a little quiet. I was expecting typical diner breakfast fare but I was super pleasantly surprised by the quality of the eggs benedict. It was spot on with a nice portion of red skin potatoes to help clean up the extra sauce and the yolks from the perfectly poached eggs. And for $6.99?  Ill be back. They offer a variety of omelettes (omlettes) and sweet things too like cinnamon bun pancakes and stuffed french toast. Definitely better than typical diner fare."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Very friendly and the food is awesome.  The bacon is the best in a 40 mile radius"}
{"text":"This is a cute place, and it seems like they try pretty hard to please.  The food is good overall, however, the corned beef hash is like lunch meat cubed up, very dry and has no flavor. Come on, I'd rather have it out of the can instead of ultra thin lunch meat cubes.  I'm not a chef, but you can chop left over corned beef brisket, onions, potatoes a little salt and pepper, boom!   The eggs benedict is delicious, and I've had one burger that had a hard bun, and absolutely no flavor, I believe they forgot to even salt the meat.  I love them changing it up with daily specials and new items.  Keep it fun!"}
{"text":"Just a random find from yelp not too far from North Royalton. Cute little place, nice service. I ordered the slim chick which is a one egg omelette with your choice of three toppings and side of fruit. It was very fresh and yummy. My fianc√© ordered The Godfather omelette which has Italian sausage in it. It was delicious. The food took a while to get to us but it was worth the wait. Love finding a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"First off, the place is pretty cute.  Very interesting inside.  For our experience, this is where the wow factor ended.  

The service was very, very sparse.  Coffee and water cups when empty for long periods of time.  had to go and ask for refills.   This is totally unacceptable especially given the small number of folks in the place.  This is how the morning started and when this happens, everything else gets noticed.

So, the orders were Corned beef hash and eggs, Buttermilk pancakes and a Biscuit and gravy.  I will start with the positive.  The Biscuit and gravy is worth having and maybe even going a little out of your way for... assuming being ignored by the wait staff is okay.

Corned beef hash was chunks of corned beef in some potatoes.  Seasoning was okay, but over all I would not recommend.  Buttermilk pancakes.  These were the thickest things I have ever seen.  They were also boxed and flavorless.  I am not sure Buttermilk even entered into the picture unless it was a buttermilk mix.  I fail to see how hard it is to make real buttermilk pancakes from scratch.  If you are going to stick it on your menu, take pride in it and do it properly.  These were disappointing to say the least.

So to recap, sit at the bar so you can get a refill of coffee.  Order biscuits and gravy or an egg dish.  There, you should be good to go."}
{"text":"Danielle and I braved the snow and cold last Sunday to finally try Knott's Family Diner for some breakfast. 

Pretty solid meal. I had what was basically a gyro omelet with hashbrowns and toast. Danielle had the Little Farmer - basically all the normal breakfast favorites (egg, potatoes, biscuits and gravy) on one plate, which she thought was good."}
{"text":"Awesome diner! My wife and I are here for breakfast every Saturday and/or Sunday, and sometimes dinner on Friday evening.  Food is great and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Medina County.  I'm almost 300 pounds, I should know."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The place it looks like from the outside it could be nice.  Once inside feels seedy.  It is dark and the staff are not friendly.

The gyro sandwich was very small and greasy.  The fries were also very greasy.  It is over priced.

They have strange business hours."}
{"text":"The friendly and hardworking owner combined with the consistently well-prepared classic American menu make this part of our regular breakfast rotation.  Not a lot of diversity on the menu but they're happy to customize any item. I'd recommend adding sausage gravy to the Country Boy omelette, delicious. 

The building is very old but recently remodeled inside and very clean. It has a real small town feel for being so close to Cleveland. Worth stopping in if you're near route 303."}
{"text":"It is the best breakfast around, love the small town feel in Valley City with big town taste. I had the Chicken and Waffles, WOW...perfect portion size. The chicken is crispy, waffle is sweet but not too sweet and the syrup had a savory flavor to it. Not over the top sweet, great mix of sweet and savory."}
{"text":"I love going to small diners like this for Sunday breakfast. This one was definitely small, but so delicious. The service was great and food was so tasty! I had a crabbie omlet which was great and my husband's omlet with sausage gravy on it was soooooo good."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, as usual! Great, friendly service and reasonably priced, delicious food - Knott's never lets us down!  This was the fourth time we visited, and I'm sure we'll be back many more times.  

I had the\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" omelette, which was originally an accidental creation due to an incorrect chicken order by the owners, but they turned their mistake into a damn tasty dish.  The omelette is filled with chicken, your choice of cheese, and topped with brown gravy that is to die for.  You may have toast, but I always opt for the homemade biscuits when I'm at Knott's, better than either of my grandmas ever made. 

The people are friendly, the food is good, what more could you ask for? Our new go-to for Sunday breakfast. Keep up the great work, Knott's!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome staff. The food is always fresh and tastes great. Pancakes are to die for and are huge. Family friendly, small town diner that delivers high quality food."}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for!!!
While in Brunswick one Saturday morning the wife and I wanted to find a small local place for breakfast. With the help of Yelp we ended up in Valley City. The food here could not be better. I had the country fried steak and eggs. The steak took up more than half of the plate and tasted awesome.  I also had a biscuit with sausage gravy. It was also great. The wife had one of the many omelette choices. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and won't be our last.  Our server was polite and efficient.  The coffee was hot and plentiful.  Our breakfast was served hot and delicious!  Everyone was friendly and kind.  The prices were reasonable.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in the area for Labor Day weekend. Excellent service and great breakfast.  Lots of options on the menu for anyone to find something. We shared the stuffed French toast and it was fantastic. Definitely make a point to stop in if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We have been back to this restaurant a lot in the last year, since we moved into the area, and have had both lunches and breakfasts. 
Their sausage gravy is amazing. It is probably the best I have ever had. Their coffee? Fantastic. In fact, we drive past another diner, near our house, because we love the coffee so much. Don't get me wrong, everything there is great, but that coffee is borderline addictive. Saturdays and Sundays are really, really busy, but they get you seated pretty quickly. They have really good burgers too. If you happen to be there on a day that the special is the open faced roast beef sandwich, give it a try, it's awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, very fair prices! If you're considering Bob Evans save yourself a few bucks drive down rt 303 and you won't be sorry you did!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for some good old fashioned breakfast on a weekday morning.  Seated quickly, menu had some nice choices.  Went with the corned beef hash.  It was definitely not from a can, as it was obviously chopped corned beef and vegetables.  However, the corned beef was a little lacking in flavor.  Eggs were cooked perfectly, though.  My kids enjoyed their choices, as well.  I can see why this place is popular."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. It's just your a average diner. I don't think it's anything special. I thought it was a little greasy for my taste. I think it's the illusion Grandma is in the back cooking. I bet she's not. I also think they buy and serve most things everyone else does."}
{"text":"Veggie omelette is delish, pancakes are thick and fluffy,  I order the potatoes extra crispy & the bacon is fresh. Tofts ice cream in a separate parlor & they have jerky for sale too!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast!!!

It's a little place, and nothing fancy, but the food is good. 

I got a special called Knott's 2x4 - 2 eggs, 2bacon, 2 sausage (links or patties) and 2 pancakes. I ordered the cinnamon rolls pancakes. They were AMAZING!!! So good, that my husband ordered some for himself! The bacon was perfectly good and amazing as well!!

My husband had the corned beef hash. It's homemade and very good. He also got a side of red skin potatoes which were delicious 

Good coffee  
Nice servers! 

A nice little find"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, friendly diner/ice cream shop all rolled into one. Went on a Sunday morning expecting to have a long wait but, no, got in right away! Food was good but took awhile. They kept us plied with coffee and apologies for the food taking so long. Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"went on a Sunday morning ... the place was pretty busy .. had to wait about 30 minutes.. not a big deal... the building is old and it pretty much smells old too... later in the day my kids were saying they still smelled like the building :)  ..anyhow, finally got seated.. got drinks fast... server was nice... 5 minutes later placed order.. not so busy now because it was around 10am now..  and so it began... the dreaded wait...  wait was getting to be so long it was become in comical...  anyhow.. I estimate about 45 minutes our orders came out.. really it could have been longer... lost track...  we couldn't believe breakfast food could take that long... we are talking omelets and waffles...   anyhow.. the food came out and I really cant complain... it was good.. and quite frankly after eating this breakfast around 11am-11:20ish by this time...  I was so full that I really did not even need to eat a dinner later that night....  nothing light about this food.. it will keep you going all day or make you want to take a nap.. :)  ....  Anyhow, if you dont mind a potential long wait..( Im guessing it was a fluke, due to no other complaints on it) or a little smellyness of the building .. I think you will enjoy the food... One final note.. little skeptical on the cleanliness of the place... just by walking by and looking in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"This stellar little diner deserves the 5 stars for their Biscuits & Gravy and Eggs Benedict.  You can taste the made-from-scratch goodness in every single bite.  The price is equally delicious.  This was my first visit and it will definitely not be the last...I would gladly drive from Lakewood just for another taste of that sausage gravy! Beyond amazing =)"}
{"text":"Exceptional atmosphere and food!

Family runs the entire place. Had breakfast and it was incredible! Bacon wasn't over saturated with sugar flavor, it was simply great!

Sausage biscuit was cooked well and tasted great. Hash browns and toast were average, but paired well with other items.

Definitely a family place!"}
{"text":"Great small diner. Everyone was exceptionally friendly and the food was great! Really good omelets and as noted before great bacon! Also looks like an awesome place for ice cream (maybe when it gets warmer out again!)."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place!!! Found this one searching on Yelp and am so glad we chose to go. This small little diner has great decor inside and out. The front has adorable wooden benches and it just looks like a place you'd want to be!!

The staff was super nice and the service was great! As for the food, it was amazing. As a huge fan of all things pickles...I'm extremely impressed with their pickle fries. Thin strips of pickles fried like french fries...to die for. I got the starving farmer for my entree and oh man...was that a lot of food. Red skinned potatoes with over easy eggs and cheese...best part...SMOTHERED with sausage gravy. And this sausage gravy was loaded with sausage. Sooo good. Only complaint is the toast was bone dry but that can be overlooked bc who needs toast when you have all the rest of that insanely good food. 
They have an ice cream shop too but we didn't get anything from there...yet. :) I have already told several people about this place and hope we get back and try other items soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was totally shocked by this little place. First time in and I will definitely be coming back. After browsing the menu for a bit we noticed they had pickle fries, we decided to order them and man was I blown away! Definitely try these when you come there, amazballs!! The garlic ranch diping sauce that came with them was just as good as the fries. 

I had the corned beef hash. I've had hash a million times and I'd give this one a B+ grade for sure. Eggs were poached just the way I like and the potatoes were cooked well. The corned beef it self was fine, not the top I've had, but not the bottom either. Very affordable as well. 

Mostly I loved the small town feel and family run atmosphere of this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love brunch and we were looking for something unique and didn't have the name \"Evan's\" or \"Bob\" in it. Since we had to go to Strongsville for a couple errands, she found this little nook on Yelp that isn't exactly on the way to Strongsville from Olmsted Falls but close enough.

When we arrived, we drove into this little town that time forgot. The restaurant still had the posts used to tie up your horse in the front. Then as you step in, you travel in time to few decades and walk into a 1950's style diner. Luckily there was a small table in the corner for us because there could have been a short wait. The waitress was very friendly and immediatly knew we were not from there. (did I mention it was a small town?) 

My wife ordered the biscuits and gravey while I had the country fried steak. Coming from the South, country fried steak is a staple so I normally have to try it if it's on the menu. This was by far the best country fried steak I've had since moving to Ohio. The best is from a diner in Oregon I had when I used to travel a lot for work. However, this was a close second. The gravy had plenty of flavor and the breading on the steak was just right. I did have a bite of my wife's sausage gravy and it may rival Lucky Cafe's. It was that good too. 

We plan to be back and maybe go for dinner too. We heard they have a really good fish fry in which they make their own batter. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a diner.  In an old building.  In a small town.  Its nothing fancy by any means and the setting is exactly what I expected it to be.  I parked on the street in front.

Had breakfast here this morning with the family.  I ordered the scratch made corned beef hash and eggs over easy with rye bread.  It was very tasty, but really wasn't hash.  They took some corned beef slices like what you get in a the grocery store deli and mix it in with some potato, onion, and green pepper.  It was good, but not really what I was expecting.  Eggs were cooked right and the toast was good.

Nothing here that really blew me away.  It was a good standard breakfast."}
{"text":"we go here on a regular basis because the food really is good...especially the pancakes! prices are alittle on the high side but well worth it for the atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, decor is right in line with the small town feel.  Everyone is peasant. A gem.
Coffee is freshly roasted, and I believe they use a local coffee roaster (Nathan's coffee roasting?).  They advertise him.
You can also get your local beef jerky here!
I ordered something that was not on the menu, nor on the specials board.  Their breakfast burritos are so good - highly recommended."}
