{"text":"Very good ambience with a bar and proposed patio dining. Literally next to Great Wolf Lodge. Excellent food. Tried the Guthi Vankaya(Eggpalnt), Cut Mirchi, chicken Biryani and Naan. Very flavorful. Spicy too!! Cut mirchi was hot with the natural heat of the peppers. Biryani was flavorful and Vankaya tasted like home cooking."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Only two negatives,  bit and I mean only a bit over priced vs other Indian places and ate there 3 times each Time dealt with a waiter who spoke and understood zero English....Otherwise food is very good, nothing dumbed down for American palates."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and food tasted good.Service was very slow.
If you have enough time in hand, this seems like a nice dine in place.Be careful to double check if the person taking the order noted down everything correctly,  he seemed a bit forgetful and lost."}
{"text":"The best south Indian restaurant in Charlotte! ! Hope they open a branch in each city !!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great food. The food is flavourful with a nice presentation. The prices are reasonable especially considering the portions and quality. The buffet has many more items than most Indian restaurants and is definitely of a higher standard. It would a great place for a quick lunch, a dinner date, or a family outing. I will most definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome food , awesome service , staff really take care of customer ... No match of Mutton sukka, chicken Biryani , Gobhi Manchurian :) ..... Love this place ."}
{"text":"Flavors are ok! But there is something wrong with guys running the place. We were 2 people, reached at around 9 pm and half the place was empty. We requested to for the booths but he said he was saving the boths for a larger group. The 2 seaters were so small and placed in the center of the floor. (They really need to consult someone on how to position the tables to have enough privacy). We ordered mutton sukha and chicken biryani with medium spice level. But the food was soo spicy that we were almost in tears. In asking why it was so spicy, the guy sad this was not even medium spicy. Guys.. you really need to learn customer service. 2 stars for the flavors."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and had the buffet. It had good variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. The food looked good and tasted fine. The dosas were thin and crispy. 
For desert they had gajar kheer ( a carrot pudding) - something I am not familiar with and didn't feel like tasting."}
{"text":"Food is not cooked properly and served cold. When asked to change the plate, same plate was heated in microwave and served. No salt in any starter. Serving is not good."}
{"text":"A good Indian restaurant , great tasting authentic Indian food, friendly staff ... Definitely a GO.."}
{"text":"Heard about Cholas - Indian Grill through my friend and finally we are here.... Awesome hospitality, staffs are very friendly. Specially a Mallu chap Ajith - who takes care of the guests very well. Food is very authentic with rich spices. Being a Non Veg freak tried the Mutton Chukka Varuval, oh man - what consistency. Never had such chukka anywhere in Charlotte. Usually all mutton dishes will have the meat smell no matter how much spices are added, but this one was so fresh, tender and with absolutely no smell of meat. Must try. Overall - I am super excited with this place."}
{"text":"We went for dinner there on Sunday. Had the paneer tikka appetizer which was yummy. The paneer was deliciously soft. We also had naan and cholas special dhal. The dhal was soo buttery and tasty. Will definitely go again !! I would have given 5 stars but for the fact nobody was there to seat us and we had to wait for sometime to get the attention of the staff to get us a table even though there were many available ."}
{"text":"I wish I had been there for one of the buffets. We went I a weeknight and the food was spectacular. Not that good is obviously made to order but was great. My favorite is gobi manchurian - incredible!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but worst service ever possible. Waiters don't care to take orders or even give menu even if hv been seated there for long. It's a good place to be if u done mind waiting for hrs before they take order and get u food. It used to be an amazing place before the staff changed completely."}
{"text":"Tried their lunch buffet on a weekend. Good to see a balanced options for both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. Some items (especially briyani) were quite spicy but lacked flavor. If your spice tolerance level is low, then this is probably not your place to try out. Breads and appetizers were relatively fresh and good. The interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all. It was more like a big hall converted into a make shift restaurant. Overall, nothing much to complain or rave about this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in quite a while.  The Butter Paneer was spot on and they actually bring fresh naan directly to your table which is always a plus.

Every dish was delicious well seasoned with just the right about of heat.

I'll be going back tomorrow, I think."}
{"text":"Worst service with this new management... food quality has also went down ... Two times it so happened that I got my order so late and that too with missing naan"}
{"text":"To walk in and smell the heavenly spices already sets your mouth on drool status. The menu is very friendly breaking the dishes down into vegetarian and non vegetarian fare i had the samosa meat pies as an appetizer very delicious careful not to burn your mouth and the tiger shrimp in cream sauce absolute HEAVEN!  Ample parking right off of Interstate 85 i would highly recommend even for sissys like me who love indian food but can rarely eat it"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I had after a long time. The food is real spicy and the quantity was decent for the price. Will definitely visit again. Mutton chukka, cholas chicken soup and cholas chicken grill were excellent."}
{"text":"I had the Lamb Vindaloo and it was really good. I also got garlic naan which was also amazing, they were the perfect texture. The lamb vindaloo was spicy but the waiter asked what level I felt comfortable with, which was nice. I would recommend and I will go back again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and very friendly staff. A wide variety of vegetarian options but plenty on the menu to please the whole family. I had the malai kofta, which was recommended by my waiter. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I would go here only for the gulab jamun and nothing else. I'm going to compare with aroma restaurant which is in same area near the concord mall. I've tried egg biryani here, which tasted very bad, I'm not a fan or aroma restaurant either, but I hoped cholas would be better, it only proved to be more worse. I've also tried mirchi bajji another night, it was too spicy because of the spice powder they sprinkled on it, but taste was ok. Then I had dosa and my husband had puri masala. Dosa was the worst dosa I've had, there was no taste in the sambar too. Sambar had no salt in it and also the potato masala with poori had no salt. We also ordered gutti vankay, which was ok, it had exactly two small eggplants in it. And the texture of poori was not soft m fluffy, it was crispy and fragile. Both times we went there, we had the gulab jamun and it was the only thing that was good, it was warm, not too hard on the inside but not too soft that it cannot hold together, the texture was perfect. I really hoped to find a better place than aroma, because we go to the mall quite often and would be delighted to find a nice Indian restaurant, but looks like aroma still wins. Cholas needs to improve on the taste of the food."}
{"text":"This is a hidden south-indian joint that offers more than it displays from the outside.

Didn't have a chance to try out the dinner menu options (yet), but went there for evening south-indian snacks, and wasn't disappointed at all! Lip-smacking food - the basic idli/wada and dosas - the sambhar and chutneys were made perfect!

Looking forward to more outings at this place"}
{"text":"Great location but that doesn't add any value.
Food - very ordinary.
Service - ordinary.
Staff - clueless about the place and management doesn't seem interested.
Pricey buffet for the food served."}
{"text":"Bad customer service.  Went there for take out. They said each person can take 1 box and many small containers for curry. I paid for 2 take outs. They gave me two boxes and 4 containers. After packing up, I asked for one extra container and the waiter says sorry only 2 allowed. They should be honest. Food is great but bad service spoils it. Heard from many friends that service is bad. They have atleast 6 curries and sides and desert. Isnt it fair to ask that people asking for take out get to take atleast 3 curries home? I guess these reviews may not even be read by them."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet.

Ambience: The ambience is ok, it feels like typical indian wedding during buffet. You will always see some or the other food item out.

Food quality: All the 4 stars you see above are for food. The taste/ quality/ variety was very good.

Price: it is on the higher side. 12.99 for weekend buffet.

If you are fond of indian food, this certainly is worth a try. Also, the hall is big, so good for parties.

P.S.: if pani puri and samosa chat are out. Go to mc donalds instead... :P you can't afford to miss that."}
{"text":"Wonderful food,  seriously.  Horrible,  horrible,  horrible service.  I can't in good conscious suggest eating here unless you are planning to take the food home.

Update October 5th, 2016. With new staff,  HUGE improvements! Front of house is very good and I now feel valued as a customer once again.  We will be repeating business."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet.. Food was very good and All the items were pretty good .Service was top notch and the restaurant is pretty big and spacious 


Would love to go again .."}
{"text":"We're in town at Great Wolf Lodge and wanted something quick, but not fast food. This restaurant came up on Yelp and is walking distance from the resort. We order tika masala and butter chicken. Both were delicious and packed with flavor. My kids who are rather picky eaters tried both and were very surprised at how much they liked the flavors. Both cleaned their plates and wanted more so that's repeat worthy in my book. The portions are not huge but that's great when you're trying to work on portion control. We will definitely eat here again.

Our only complaint is that Yelp said they delivered and when we called we were told they do not deliver. Since they were walking distance it was not a big deal."}
{"text":"* Customer Service: Bad. We had to ask for napkins and silverware. We were asked by three different waiters if our order was taken or not. This shows me they have no system regarding customer orders.
* Food: Okay. I asked for Masala Dosa. What I received was a Dosa with Masala on the side."}
{"text":"Terrible service, no consistency in food quality . rude staff. 
Avocado in a dish was rock hard. They gave us a soggy pre-cooked dosa while giving crisp fresh dosa at nearby table. when i told them, they asked me \"what do you want us to do?\" !!!

I wish there was an option give 0 stars"}
{"text":"I would had rated higher - but the food ordered here is way too pricy for the quantity they provide. We always order a pair of Gobi Manchurian from Cholas for take out and it comes in a standard take out boxes. The quantity initially was fine even though they had added fillers like raw onion, cabbage and capsicum and lemon. It used to completely fit in the box and sufficient for 3-4 people. And mind you, it costs $7.5 with tax. Later on, the quantity decreased and the fillers increased. Upon asking, i was said they have informed the chef and have fixed the issue. Ordered it next time and it was still the same. Called and complained about the same but same response. Hoping they fixed it, ordered it again - but the issue was still the same. Funny thing, the fillers were added to the bottom as well as the top. The head chef says that is the amount that should be there in the box. The taste of the gobi Manchurian however is good. The 2 stars is salvaged by the taste alone.

My gripe is that if they are fixated with the amount of food in the box and the amount of fillers in it, they should reconsider the price per plate. Not sure why i am paying for raw carrots, onions, bell peppers, cabbage etc which eventually doesn't get eaten."}
{"text":"Cholas Rocks!  Service was a bit slower than I wanted for a Wednesday , but weekend service has been really quick. Overall, the food was really good as always and the price was much more reasonable than most.  

The layout is open and gives you some comfort and breathing room. It also does not hurt they the location is relatively new."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place. Finally tried it for dinner. One word describes my experience - disappointment. Service was as worse as it can get in an Indian restaurant. Had chicken tandoor and goat. Chicken was awful, goat dish had more bones and fat, literally did not find an ounce of meat. On top of that, naan was no better than pita bread toasted in an oven.

Maybe their south indian snack items (dosa, etc) are better, but i do not recommend other menu items"}
{"text":"Went to Cholas for dinner after it was recommended by a colleague.
Loved the service and specially our waiter.
We ordered chicken tikka masala, malai
Kofta with some naan for the main course and gobhi manchurian for appetizer, loved the food.
Our waiter introduced us to our chef and overall they were really accommodating and welcoming to any request.
I recommend this place strongly and hope they keep up the amazing service.
We will be back very soon..."}
{"text":"Never has I left a restaurant where I like the food and left completely unsatisfied. I ordered the tandoori chicken and my girlfriend had the tiger prawns. I got 5 small peices of chicken that were more bone than meet for $13 and she got 7 modest shrimp for $14. The menu said it came with a salad, not sure if they meant the small garnish on the plate or if they just failed to bring us salads. I can only expect that they wanted us to fill ourselves up on rice and naan, but I left hungry.

The food was delicious, but portions were small for an expensive price. Place was empty and staff seemed bored and uninterested in customers. All that and being tucked away, I do not expect this restaurant to last. We were in agreement that we would never go back."}
{"text":"Came in for the lunch buffet and thought the food was very competitive to other Indian options in Charlotte. The South Indian was a highlight. The biriyani was nicely spiced. I especially liked the Gobi Manchurian. Would recommend this place to others and am curious to come back and see what it is like for dinner."}
{"text":"Very good food! Had visited once and loved it. Must go place and my personal recommendation try chicken tandoori"}
{"text":"The name of the place sounded South Indian. I thought I will go check it out. They have the best South Indian items. I tried the idly and medhu vada.  The idly was as soft as a flower. Dosa and vada were good too. Saravana Bhavan can't even come close...

Try their rasamalai dessert too. It was great. 

Will visit this place as many times as possible."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience happened to us last month. Me and my family are pure vegetarians and we ordered Paneer Butter Masala for main course. When the dish came, we noticed that it wasn't paneer for sure but something else as it was very hard to cut by spoon. When we asked one of the attendants there he said \"YES. It's a paneer!!\". We still insisted on getting it verified from the chef, and he took the dish and went inside the kitchen. When he came back, he said \"We are so sorry, it wasn't paneer but SOMETHING ELSE\", and said \"Give us few minutes and we will bring the dish you had ordered\". We told him to hold on to the dish, but first tell us what was that which was served to us. To our shock and surprise he said, \"IT WAS SOME NON-VEG DISH\", without naming it. We complained about this to the manager whose name was MUTHU and he started apologizing for the mess up.

At least me and my family are never ever going to this restaurant any more, and I would personally recommend all my vegetarian food lover friends to avoid this one as they are in a real messed up state. You will never get a clue as to who is doing what.Every attendant seems to be very confused there and probably that's the reason they did mess up our order.

There are much better options in and around Charlotte, so I would recommend everyone to stay away from this restaurant. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This Indian joint is fantastic. The wait staff was very attentive and the food fresh and piping hot. I hope more people try this place out and give it a shot. Quality food and a great atmosphere. 

I will eat here again next time I am in Concord."}
{"text":"This review is for weekend lunch buffet only : veg dishes are excellent. Biriyani is consistently bad. Chicken tandoori and fish fry are bad too. Mutton dishes are too good. Gulab jamun is from the fridge and is too sweet. Vada, samosa chaat are good. Seating area is very big with separate space for catering and parties. The place is clean. The staff is ok."}
{"text":"The food was amazing today!! Lots of choices for vegetarians and for non vegetarians. The baby corn Manchurian was absolutely amazing today and so was the fishy fry crunchy and soft!!!"}
{"text":"This place is now my favorite spot in Charlotte for Indian food, hands down. It's a newly built restaurant with plenty of room inside in there dining space and bar area. The wait staff were extremely nice and helpful. 

The food was great and the menu has plenty to choose from. The Gobi Manchurian was our favorite!! Everyone should try it. No, you have to try it!!

Great place and great authentic Indian food!!"}
{"text":"For me, this place does the best when it comes to Southern Indian flavor! I feel that their location doesn't help them but it's so worth is to drive a little out of your way if you're craving flavorful cuisine! The service is attentive and fast without compromising the food's freshness. I especially loved the dosa we shared. Come on in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Nice setting and food was terrific, and the staff were friendly. The food was slow to come out."}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch buffet on a Friday. Place wasn't that busy.  Good variety of foods on the buffet, everything was tasty but my only complaint would be that everything was extremely spicy and I am Indian and I like spicy food."}
{"text":"The worst indian food. Spicy curries with undercooked meat. I would give a 0/5 if this allows me to."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and have been very impressed with the food quality.  This place is better than every place we have been to in Atlanta.  Service is great too.  They have high quality on both North and South Indian dishes--which is a rarity.  My final comment is that \"you ask and they deliver!\""}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with Cholas. When we arrived, there was a lunch buffet set up. Everything looked really good but our waiter said the buffet was being closed down in 20 minutes. I hate rushing during a meal, so we opted for menu items. The restaurant itself is very spacious with high ceilings. It is the last store front/corner at the end of multiple empty retail spaces (so don't give up when you're looking). Our waiter was nice but not the most attentive. We had to get our own napkins and ask for silverware and refills. A bottle of Kingfisher primed the pump for a nice meal.

The Gobi Manchurian, a crispy brown coated cauliflower dish, was our starter. It was simply awesome. I could eat my own weight in Gobi. Gobi makes me want to be a vegetarian, almost. My kids even ate Gobi. Get the Gobi Manchurian. The Butter Naan was fresh and on par with the rest of the dishes. The Masala Dosa came with the stuffings (potatoes, eggplant, and assorted sauces/chutneys on the side) - it was all delicious. I caved in and just ate the coconut, creamy one with a spoon. The Chicken Tikka Masala sauce was incredible - buttery, tomato-ey , rich, delightful. The chicken was nice and tender, but you could tell it was added to the sauce post cooking and not simmered in the sauce. The chef even came out to check on us and see how we enjoyed our food = standing \"O\" for the Gobi! A la carte prices are reasonable, but I would definitely recommend the lunch buffet for around$11 if you want to sample their offerings across the board.

The restaurant was definitely clean. My only criticism or recommendation would be to sit where your customers sit to see what they see. You might find some dust here or there or handprints on windows that need some attention.
 
Great Indian joint in Concord! Come get you some!!!"}
{"text":"There is no reason for me to give stars. However, i do have reviews to on the service. Weekend timings online is 10:30 (usually in any restaurant kitchen closes 30 mins before). So, my friends and i went at 9pm and was told \"we are closed\". There are no hi or hellos or no apology. I wonder how come no one ever complained about this."}
{"text":"Delicious! Been here a few times and it's always consistent. Service is fantastic. Usually go for the lunch buffet and everything is usually very fresh. Highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"The Gobi Manchurian was finger lickin' good, and the Chicken Cettinad was like nothing I've tasted before: brilliant!!!! Butter chicken was a little too sweet, but overall great food, def coming back"}
{"text":"We had a catering order for 50+ adults. We had veggie items - masala wada, spinach pakoras, coconut rice, Andhra style gutti vankaya curry, Tindora peanuts fry & Shahi Tukra. Kudos to chef Anand and his kitchen staff who prepared all the items extraordinarily delicious. Thanks to manager Muthu too who made sure all the items were prepared and delivered on time. I would definitely recommend Cholas let it be dine in or catering."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, Lots of vegetarian options but not so much for vegans but still great compared to most restaurants. Service was okay. Would like to try their buffet some time."}
{"text":"\"Booth is for 4 people\", \"ok\", Buffet only, \"ok\"..

I am not a regular yelp reviewer. So don't take my words light.

Food is good. Chefs have really good talent in preparing the food with taste, authenticity and selection of varieties in buffet.

Now comes to the service. Why the hell on this earth would someone work for something if they don't or not willing to work. I went to restaurant on Sunday and i can hardly see one waiter in the restaurant.

People were already waiting to pay their bills in front of the kiosk and that waiter is standing towards the wall and don't bother to even take the payment from the customers.

Finally someone was roaming here and there and i went to him in middle of the restaurant and asked for a table. He didn't reply!..So weird!...i asked again. He pointed out a table with his index finger which was not cleaned yet. I said i want a booth. Voila!...finally he spoke saying \"Booth is for 4 people\"...Lol!..seriously is that the way you answer your customers?...Anyways i did math. There were 3 booths empty, it was 2:30, your restaurant closes at 3. And there was a group waiting to be seated which u don't bother. That group is of 10 people. So they not going to fit in a booth anyways. And i see few of the customers are done eating, so you have 3 more booths left if you want to seat any customers . So total 6 booths are available and you have 30 minutes time , because your restaurant closes at 3. After this big explanation he said. OK!...

I sat down...no water...no waiter..i see 3-4 waiters standing against wall just staring outside...not smile, i think they are all in pain....i wanted to ask if there is any problem but i thought it would be weird...finally someone came and gave us water. I asked if i can order from menu. He said sorry only buffet. That was weird too. If there is only buffet then put a sign outside saying \"Buffet Only\". Then he said OK i will take your order. He took my order.

I ordered 1 plate medu vada. No sign of this guy for 20 minutes. Other waiters were just roaming here and there no one cares no one talks no one collects payments from customers this is weird place. I went to restroom i saw 2-3 waiters there just standing inside the restroom.

Anyways my food came finally. And meantime i finished my water which they poured 30 minutes back. I want more water but no sign of anyone watching me. I have to get up my self and go near the kitchen where they stock up all water jugs, and pick up a jug and come back to my table and have that water. 1-2 waiters saw me doing this. no one cared to ask what i am doing though. The table beside me saw me and they also started to get up and get the water themselves from the entrance of the kitchen.

I got angry but i enjoyed seeing very strange people all at a time. It was funny for me. I was in a restaurant for nearly 1 hour and all i spoke or or heard is . \"Booth is for 4 people\", \"ok\", Buffet only, \"ok\". Only these 4 words. 

If you don't train your waiters then you should probably shut it down soon. Your food is awesome and hats off to chefs who are brilliantly bringing various authentic vibrations of south Indian foods to us. But never coming back!...

Finally they have dosa in buffet which comes to your table. And 90 percent of the people didn't know that. They only serve if u go to the waiter standing against the wall and ask \"can i get dosa\". Then he will bring it up for you. I saw he bought 3 dosa's for a table of 2. And 2 dosas for a table of 6 people. 0 IQ. All i noticed while waiting for my food. :P"}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for post-shopping lunch. To our surprise, we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. Our server, was so kind! We ended up chatting with him for quite a while. My mother is learning Tamil which is the language he speaks and he was so helpful and taught us a lot about his culture. I would suggest you get Soda, I did not care for the taste of the water. There was a lot of options on the buffet. I can't remember or pretend to know how to spell the names of most of them. However, I will say that the meat dishes were all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Cholas takes me back home! This is for all those who feel home-sick. Go to the buffet and you will be satisfied for sure with the authentic South Indian dishes. Just feels like home. Not to forget the chicken biriyaani, chicken 65, sambar and rasam! Will go back to Charlotte just for cholas. The service is great and the head-chef really knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"Ugh...awful service and food was subpar.  I don't see this restaurant lasting 3 more months."}
{"text":"The taste of the chettinad chicken biriyani with the vepudu chicken mesmerizes you with the first bite! Neat and huge restaurant! I loved the food !"}
{"text":"Quality of food is compromised by the worst service. The server dint take the order properly, never bothered to apologize, and then took an hour to bring the food. Finally,made us wait 20mts for boxes, ignored to bring the check to table and had to pay the bill at the counter. Attitude at its peak!! A simple apology and good will to compensate it by speedy delivery would have lightened the situation. Clearly shows he doesn't care about the clients and of course least cares about the success of restaurant. what bothers him if we don't go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Food was ok-ok. Medium spice turned out to be spicy. They need to time their order taking. I had to call them to take the entree order. Could have been slightly better food for us to think of coming back. There are other good options compared to this in the vicinity."}
{"text":"I like their Apollo fish and Chicken soup. Very friendly service and authentic south indian food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decent South Indian food. A lot of varieties for lunch buffet and everything tastes good."}
{"text":"We love coming to Chola's, one of our favorite Indian buffet places other than Aroma. Our first experience was our takeout order for the Manny vs Pacquiao fight, delicious! The Apollo fish was my ultimate favorite, it had so much flavor and wasn't spicy at all. I literally could not wait for the next time we eat at Chola's. We also had some chicken biriyani too, not bad. The first time we came here for the weekend buffet, it was packed! But it was understandable, Chola's had the biggest buffet lineup I had ever seen. Not only did they offer a wide variety of food, the food tasted good as well. Worth the $12-13 per person. The Dhal makhani and upma are my favorites. The chicken tikka is good as well, but the Blue Taj has the best buffet chicken tikka I've every had. I love that they offer pani puri and samosa chaat. The kheer dessert they offered last visit was ok. They also offer a complimentary drink with the buffet, first time we came here it was mango lassi and the last time was this great tasting apple juice. 

I'll have to come back for a regular dinner service, that apollo fish is amazing. The service is ok, not great. But, they will pick up your buffet plates and refill your water..eventually. You got to stare them down, even when its not busy. 

The other issue I have here is that they served semi-warm water without ice, not the first choice when dining on hot, spicy foods. Step up your water/service game Chola's and you'll get the 5/5."}
