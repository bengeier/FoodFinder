{"text":"Great little coffee shop right in the middle of our neighborhood.  The atmosphere is very nice, and simplistic.  The menu is posted on two screens above the counter with light food items available on display. The owners had complimentary blueberry muffins for customers to enjoy. Everything looks delicious! The drink selection includes everything from coffee, hot chocolate, smoothies, tea and seasonable lattes. Prices are reasonable and rather fantastic, considering what most coffee shop aficionados are used to. Seating can accommodate large groups, individual seats at the bar and even outdoor chairs. Vegetarian and gluten free options are on the way."}
{"text":"So excited to happen upon this cute little coffee shop/Caf√©!  They even have a full vegan menu with some really tasty vegan sandwiches!  You can tell the owners put a lot of care into the ingredients because it's very good, not just a couple things thrown together just to be able to say they have vegan options.  We also had a mango smoothie that was pretty good, but not excellent.  I would have liked the sandwich to be a little more filling for the price we paid, but I do understand how costly vegan ingredients can be.  In the end, I'm just happy to see tasty vegan options available!  I would also like to see some vegan scones or sweet options, but this is a very good start!  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Their latte is just amazing. Tried their candy flavor. It was surely unique and fun. They got a Pokemon spot right next to them. Place to kill a couple of hours."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great coffee and friendly staff. The house baked pastry is really good. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing.  Today I ordered a latte and veggie breakfast sandwich with added avocado. My daughter got a bagel and a decaf iced chai latte. My son ordered a bacon breakfast sandwich and a peppermint hot chocolate. Everything was so good! Especially the mixed berry scone!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Super cute family cafe. Great customer service, great food. I like that they have vegetarian options. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good coffee! I am happy to have a little place close to home. The coffee and finger food is nice and since it is located in the center of our neighborhood it is uber convenient as well. The staff are very nice and they have locally roasted beans. I am so glad it was not a Starbucks as well. Oh and the prices are better. Definitely an revisit!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once while on a play date at the park nearby. But we ordered a bunch of hot chocolates and the barista was really nice. We hope this place does well."}
{"text":"Came in 8 min to close. APOLOGIZED for being so close to close. Asked for food. Was told panini machine was off and could not be turned back on. Usually off switches have on switches too."}
{"text":"The egg sandwich is soooo good, coffee is also pretty good, and price is quite reasonable, definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious tea : ).  The food is yummy, too.  A combination that can't be beat!  Whether you enjoy the cool ambiance of the locale, or take it to go and stroll in the parks, or on the paths, this cafe is a perfect place to stop : )"}
{"text":"very nice and cute coffee shop in the community,  coffee is great, service is great. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, and tasty pastries. Quick service, and super convenient location if you live in the area. Super modern decor. Right next to the park! Must try!"}
{"text":"Nice little space in the Inspirada Community. Right next to a nice park with plenty of outdoor seating around it. The cafe is spacious on the inside with tables of various sizes, a large TV, and board games set out as well. The service is so friendly. So far I've only had a green smoothie (DELICIOUS), coffee, and a veggie wrap. They young lady behind the counter was so nice to ask me back over to the counter after I'd ordered my sandwich and was putting cream in my coffee to explain to me that the pesto in the sandwich wasn't 100% vegan. I am not a vegan, that sandwich just sounded good to me (and it was!) but I thought it was really nice she took the time to make sure I wouldn't be stepping outside my diet or health decisions had I actually wanted a completely vegan meal.   I'm pleased to have a new cafe in the neighborhood to enhance this great community. Will definitely frequent."}
{"text":"The owners and staff are fantastic! Even better is the coffee, possibly the smoothest cup I have ever had."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to grab breakfast with the kids.  The food and smoothies were good.  I had the turkey pesto panini and it was delicious.  They had board games and a chalk board to entertain the kids.  It's location next to the Park was also ideal."}
{"text":"Really love this store. The coffee here is soooooo authentic and the phenomenon is so warm and lovely. I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe in the heart of Inspirada and right next to a kid's playground. Great vanilla iced latte and veggie sandwich. I will definitely come back and will try their breakfast sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood coffee spot. It's always crowded on the weekend which to me means it's the place to be. They have plenty of tables inside with magazines and great lighting. My husband and I usually have our dog so we opt to sit outdoors and they always have fresh water sitting out for our pup. Their lattes and brewed coffee are great and they have tons of flavors and milk to choose from. My husband always gets a bagel or breakfast sandwich both of which are always fresh and quick. They also have a pretty large vegan menu. The last couple times I went I was able to enter my phone number for a rewards program and I already get a free drink on my next purchase!"}
{"text":"Great food but horrible customer service. I ordered large drink and received a small, when I asked for my large drink one of the baristas snappily told me she would \"check the ticket\". After she came back and addressed me with a very rude attitude one of my friends from my group asked for a knife the worker again snapped and told her \"knives are at the condiment bar\" while not even looking at my friend. A group after us waited around 5-7 minutes until addressed. However very good food."}
{"text":"A cute little cafe located in a community in Anthems-(Inspirada). There's a park with playgrounds and a community pool near by. We ordered mango smoothies, a chocolate chip cookie, and a vegetarian wrap. I wanted some scones, but apparently they were sold out. We arrived too late. Maybe next time? Directly across the street was a construction site. Looks like a future urban style townhouses going up? Plenty of growth. What a great location. :)"}
{"text":"cute place, nicely located by a park and offer vegan items. They have a few convenience items available as well"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always stop by after seeing the progress on our new house and the staff is always really friendly and accommodating. Can't wait until we make this our go to place!"}
{"text":"We came here...but we were not impressed.  A weekday afternoon husband and I were the only patrons in the place at about 2pm.  Now while thankful for a vegan menu, it is really nothing impressive.   When we entered we were not greeted and they only one young lady looked irritated that we even entered.  While we don't need a song and dance the quiet, empty place felt cold and the tv even showed nothing but a screensaver.   I said \"hello, we have never been here!\" and got zero response. I was looking aimlessly around and finally noticed the vegan menu sits on the ground (pic posted).  While I told her we want a few sandos/bagel sandos etc I asked her if she had anything vegan to go on the side she said \"ummmm no! just plain Lays potato chips\" ok.  Husband ordered a bottled water and I ordered an iced mocha made with almond milk. While I was glad it wasn't HFCS sweet...it was kinda bland. Very weird. Maybe I needed to purchase an extra shot?  All and all my husbands \"panini\" was sourdough bread smashed into a press and my sando was ok...it is something that you only want to eat in a bind.  These vegan items are nothing more than some spinach, JustMayo, bread and Tofurky and maybe they burger was Kroger brand Simple Truth. Not sure what I expected, but that's what I got.  I found it odd the young lady turned into a totally different person when the security guard man came in and they chatted for at least the 30+ minutes we were in there, otherwise she retreated to the back.  The service was as bland as the food and coffee.  I loooooooove supporting local businesses and this place got an extra star just because it was local and we were in a bind while looking at some properties in Inspirada.  I will try and go into their Rainbow location, maybe it's better :)"}
{"text":"I think the place was kinda new, the place is really nice surrounded by houses and both sides has park for kids and dog. The place has no bathroom inside the store I actually didn't find it maybe it's connected to the park bathroom. Place is pet friendly they have dog hooks outside and water bowl they also have treat for the dogs, I don't know if they are allowed inside though. The place has a cute ambiance inside. The owner is really nice I think the Asian lady was the owner she's been really helpful also suggested a drink for my friend that they just got it for us to try, prices are really decent also uses 15% off thru tell for checking in. Drinks and food were good we ordered green tea mint and iced caramel macchiato and French toast all was really good."}
{"text":"The definition of a community coffee house- if you dislike children or dogs, stay away! This spot is in the middle of a neighborhood park adjacent to a playground, and I don't have enough fingers to count how many pooches were on the patio.   Decor is bright and clean, with decorative coffee cups available for purchase and a stack of books and games to settle in with. Oh, and they have a TV in the dining room so you can catch up with the news while you wait for your order- in addition to coffee, they have some breakfast and lunch sandwiches, as well as a small case of pastries (the lemon bars are incredible!).   The only downside to this spot is it's completely obscure location."}
{"text":"Love! It's hidden in the neighborhood right next to one of the parks. Clean and cozy."}
{"text":"When I asked my kid what their favorite thing was about the meal they said \"the ice water.\"  This was before I said a single thing about the food...it was that bad. The staff was nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Jolly Beans Cafe, as we walked in it was cute and inviting. The lady working said it would be a few minutes before we could order, we waited patiently until it was our turn to order.   I ordered a turkey wrap and added avocado. A strawberry banana smoothie and a few pastries. We sat down and waited for our food to arrive. Another guy brought us our bagel and then asked if I wanted my sandwich cold or on a panini. I told him I ordered a wrap so he went and got it for me. As I bit in it was something completely different so I took it back up to the lady and told her I ordered turkey and I did not like her attitude when she tried to tell me I ordered some special, that wasn't even listed on the menu. This was my first time here how would I even know what the special was that she mentioned. She kept repeating that I had ordered that item. They remade my wrap but then they were out of avocado so I wasn't able to get it on there. She also forgot that I had ordered the smoothie so she had to go and make it.   I would try this place again but was not impressed with the lady working."}
{"text":"Loving everything about this place already! The lattes, the space, the staff, and even the prices! So far we've had the coconut and caramel lattes, and a cheese danish. The lattes are perfectly roasted with just the right touch of sweetness. Danish is soft, creamy and fresh! Only day 2 and this place is already a favorite. Usually I give a learning curve to new places but they seem to already have a delicious handle on their espresso machine, yummm!   Final thought: so excited to FINALLY have this place in the neighborhood and even more thrilled that it's a place I want to return to (daily) and bring my friends too!"}
{"text":"I work at Inspirada so I get a coffee drink here daily. They do a great job of remembering my \"special order\" and I love that. I also eat here pretty often and have enjoyed everything I have tried. My favorites are veggie breakfast sandwich and Caprese on a wrap (add pesto mayo).   Jolly Beans has also catered many association meetings and events for me. They are great about planning the menu and changing it up with new exciting offerings. Residents have claimed their cookies are, \"the best they've ever eaten\" and shared much praise recently on homemade salsa and guacamole they brought for a new meeting. We had breakfast catered with adorable mini-pancakes, mini-frittatas and parfait and I'm the guests loved it!"}
{"text":"Great ambience! Free wifi, board games, magazines. Great place to just hang and relax with family and friends. Price is reasonably. Located next to park so can watch kids play while you eat."}
{"text":"Love love love this little coffee shop! I came in, and the staff/owners were all so nice. I ordered a coffee with steamed cream and a chocolate muffin for the little ones, it was all perfectly made. They are expanding their menu and also made me avocado toast with tomato and olive oil drizzle on the house. Such a yummy snack. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Super cute Cafe in Inspirada neighborhood. This is such a nice option to have if you live there. Nice selection of breakfast, lunch options  and they also have a vegan menu!!! Nicely decorated, bright colored seats liven the place. There are board games, an easel to keep kids busy while you enjoy your meal or java.  Very clean and super friendly staff.   This Cafe also does wonderful events with the Inspirada community.  This time we had hot chocolate, aroma latte, and a muffin and a few games of connect 4."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food, friendly staff and love that it's in our neighborhood! They're always reaching out to customers for input and what we would like to see on the menu. I love that they are so integrated in our community and helped sponsor the community soccer league! Do yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"My best friend that I've known since Kindergarten lives in Inspirada and I decided to drop by her house for a visit one day. She told me about this place -- Jolly Bean's Cafe and recommended that we try it out. It's funny how a neighborhood gets its little own coffee shop. It was over 110 degrees outside that day so we got ourselves a lemonade to cool us off. Food is limited, though.  There's board games and a TV in the building for your entertainment needs. It's mainly quiet, which is a good thing, especially for a developing neighborhood. Will come back next time I'm in Inspirada."}
{"text":"Very cute place located in Inspirada.  I love supporting local businesses and this place has a nice vibe.  I have only had a smoothie so far, and it was very tasty.  I would much rather spend my money here, then lining some rich CEO's pocket. I will definitely be back to enjoy their tasty offerings."}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses which is why I paid a visit to Jolly Beans Cafe while spending the holiday with family in Henderson, NV. The location is tucked away in a newer housing development called Inspirada. The space is nicely decorated and comfortable, with a local neighborhood vibe. So down to business. Let's talk about the coffee. I'm kind of a cappuccino nut because a good cappuccino requires the perfect balance of espresso and milk. One thing always worries me about coffee shops is when they have size options for cappuccino. Unfortunately, Jolly Beans has a small and large option which both consist of two espresso shots. I decided to try the small which is usually the safest bet. The cappuccino itself was very milk heavy which was a disappointment, although I will say it is far better than any other options in the area. It was much closer to a latte than a cappuccino. From a coffee standpoint, I feel like they are actually pretty close and will hopefully dial in the differences between a latte and a cappuccino. For most people, this may not matter much, but for discerning patrons it will be a problem.  I have to say the owners are quite nice. They offered me a sample of one of their scones which was quite tasty. Rating this place is difficult. They are relatively new and their coffee is much better than any local chain in the area so for that reason I will be coming back. The space is comfortable and the owners are very welcoming and friendly. I only sampled the scone so I cannot comment on their other food options. For most people this place will be great. They have the standard tea, coffee, chai, and smoothie options which appeal to a wide audience. Rating primarily on the cappuccino, this is a 3-4 star coffee shop. I am rounding up to 4 stars because I am particularly picky when it comes to coffee and this place needs to be rated on more than just the coffee. For example, as a member of the local community, they have tools that you can borrow. That's super cool and friendly. I hope when I return next year that this place is still in business."}
{"text":"First review of 2016 and I wanted to start it off on a positive note. This is the cutest little locally owned coffee shop located in the Inspirada community. I live nearby and I wanted to change up my coffee location. The shop is open, clean and very welcoming. They have a small menu of drinks and bakery items, but they pack a punch! Their coffee is smooth and strong and got me hyper for a few hours. And that's pretty strong considering I'm a huge coffee drinker. I also tried a warm blueberry scone. Heaven is all I have to say. It was moist and had lots of fresh blueberries. I especially liked the sugar crystals baked on top of the scone because it gave the scone a little crunch. The staff is friendly and made sure we were satisfied with our orders. Will I be back for my caffeine fix? TOTES!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place for a little gathering with coffee and delicious homemade goodies.  Friendly service and DELICIOUS food. Also they cater to business meetings, kids' sports events and birthdays. All healthy food. Want something else besides pizza and soda for your events? This place is your answer"}
{"text":"I would give it one more shot and eat there instead of take it to go. Veggie breakfast sandwich was ok. It lacked flavor and the cheese they used seemed like generic oil based American cheese slices? It was melted into liquid when I ate it .. There was barely any avocado at all on my sandwich and they ran out of everything bagels so I ate it on a much less than amazing plain bagel. The coffee was good. Ordered a regular brew with a splash of cream and light caramel drizzle."}
{"text":"What a great find! (Credit goes to my brother for telling me about it.) Nestled in a residential area, adjacent to a park/playground, this coffee shop has all the trappings of a place to hang out while you're supposed to be working. Comfortable tables, interesting books on the shelves to serve as distractions, and a pretty good selection of bites that can fuel you through the next few items on your to-do list.  The service was really personable too - like a true local coffee shop. Definitely going back... and shh! don't tell too many people about it. ;)"}
{"text":"I love Jolly Beans!  They have a lot of variety with different milks, flavors, drinks and food. The staff is very friendly and always patient when I spend an extra minute having a hard time making up my mind.   My brother loved their hot chocolate and said it was really rich without being too sweet. I've enjoyed the different lattes and smoothies from JB as well!  I haven't had any of their food because I can't eat gluten due to am allergy, but I've taken my son there and he has eaten each panini and breakfast sandwich we've gotten h. Great place to relax, play some board games, read the paper and relax. Always clean and always friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Amazing staff and food. My favorite food items are the turkey pesto panini and the bbq panini. My favorite drinks would have to be the smoothies and their mochas! Super good!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time and have only good things to say about this place. Convenient, reasonably priced, & delicious. I'll be back many more times. I'm happier knowing that every dollar spent supports a local small business versus a corporation."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like their food since we are their Inspirada neighbor... but... Sunday morning pancake and omelette were not up to par. Do not order the pancake it was horrible... almost looked and tasted like a microwave pancake. Omelette wasn't bad but toast was cold and hard and it took forever to get our food. Smoothie wasn't bad and coffee hot. Prob won't go back for their food. I still hope they are successful."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but great local coffee shop with quick service. Next to a kids park, so great morning stop with your kiddos. Shop local here instead of waiting 10 cars deep in Starbucks drive-thru. Fan of the veggie breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"If you live in seven hills, you really should check out this little coffee shop. It's hidden away inside the Inspirada neighborhood so turn on your gps  We went at 10am on a Thursday. There's only one barista and about 8  customers, so let me tell you, I was skeptical. Boy was I proven wrong! Our lattes were perfect and hot, delicious and FAST!  We didn't order food but they had a very decent sized menu with sandwiches and plenty of nice pastries, muffins and baked goods.  They also offered smoothies , teas and fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"So I went in today at 300.  I bought a large Americano and walked out to my car. I use a cane due to MS.  Well I stumbled and spilled the drink on my windshield.  The male employee at Jolly Beans came right out with a rag and wiped my windshield off while the female one brought me a fresh coffee.  I was so embarrassed at my clumsiness but they both made me feel like everything was alright.  I love this place and I recommend it to everyone.  Thanks Jolly Beans. You are the best."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I stopped here for lunch after the farmers market and we will definitely be back! Our paninis, muffin and smoothie were all delicious and customer service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Really good piping hot cappuccino and delicious blueberry muffin at a very reasonable price. Owners are great. It's located in the Inspirada community  at 2016 Via Firenze.   We saw this grand opening advertised and drove from Anthem to support this business. We all need to support the local businesses in our community so they flourish. I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming smoothie... Save your money. Strawberry banana smoothie tasted like ice with a splash of strawberries."}
{"text":"Adorable place, vegan menu, and they give free refills but unfortunately the barista cannot make a proper cappuccino. The milk was scalded and separated. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great little caf√© if you're in the area. They've got cool board games inside, and a small section of outdoor seating just at the entrance and the back exit. Perfect placement as it's also next to the grassy area and the playground. They've got a nice breakfast menu and often have a popup event with specials! If there was one closer to my area, I'd love to stop by more often!"}
{"text":"Update: The owner had contacted me a few days back and apologized for the miscommunication and offered me a $10 gift card as well. Went in today and staff was pleasant as they normally are and order was on point."}
{"text":"Love our community coffee shop. Their food is so delicious. The omelets on Saturday are the bomb!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Excellent service and atmosphere! Their vegetarian options are to die for. Wonderful choice in music! I loved that they played The Beatles and other classic happy songs. My mother and I had a wonderful time there."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have found this place! I enjoy going there for a relaxing breakfast or lunch with my daughter because it's right next to the park. Outside, they have a tiny honor system library, which is a concept that I'm a huge fan of and wish more places would incorporate. Best of all, I'm grateful for the vegan menu! Not too many places near my home offer vegan food. They also have board games that you can enjoy while you wait for your food. Love that this place is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here and we LOVED it.  Menu is very basic, but so delicious.  They told us their new chef will be starting tomorrow and expand the menu.  Can't wait.  We had cappuccino, mango smoothie and turkey sandwich.  All were very good, but the sandwich was crazy good.  I love a basic sandwich, but it is important everything is super fresh.  They nailed it.  The tomato, and lettuce were perfect.  The pesto spread was delicious.  Everything was in balance.  The staff was very helpful and nice. I actually want to go back again tomorrow...lol."}
{"text":"I love that Jolly Beans Cafe  have a vegan menu! I highly recommend the VegOut Veggie wrap.  Plus-- their location is very convenient, and I can also call ahead of time to place an order and just grab it on my way home.  Great customer service, friendly staff, and the owners are wonderful! I'm thrilled to have this neighborhood cafe inside Inspirada! Having some vegan options  is definitely a plus for me!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer service! That have a wide verity of choices, and even vegan options which is awesome!! I love going there. I would recommend their turkey pesto sandwich and their chai!! Their chai is so good."}
{"text":"This is a great cafe. The food is excellent, prices are reasonable, and the staff is very friendly. We go there quite frequently. I don't drink coffee so I can't speak to that, but their smoothies are very good! They have a life long customer in me."}
{"text":"The Matcha Latte was fantastic. It's a cute place, in a great neighborhood. A cute playground for the kids is right next to it. Although I didn't have any of the food, the menu looked enticing."}
{"text":"I've only ordered a few drinks from here, but everyone who works there is very nice and helpful. My matcha latte was delicious, flavorful, and reasonably priced ($5). The bagel was delicious as well.   I love that they have outside seating right by the park.  Good little local neighborhood cafe. Can't wait to try their food options and more."}
{"text":"It's a cute area where this cafe is located, very relaxing. I got a breakfast bacon egg n cheese bagel. Very delicious but the coffee, not so much. I am huge on iced coffee, but I had the white chocolate w/coconut milk. Wasn't good unfortunately why I gave them 4 stars.. It tasted funny..."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit down and chat with friends. The service was quick and the drinks we ordered tasted good. I will be back"}
{"text":"We were looking for a cozy little coffee shop Sunday, and found the perfect spot.   We were wanting a light lunch, but were in need of some java! Love this neighborhood, and were excited about the rave reviews here. We ordered a BBQ Chicken Panini on sourdough.  My husband has been on a caramel and vanilla latte kick lately, and I was thrilled to find that they had sugar free flavored syrups for my latte. I decided on the 'sugar free' caramel and vanilla latte, and he chose the regular.   There was a large tv with an NFL game playing, a child's chalk board and lots of board games to play. There are a decent amount of tables here, as well as a few outside.  It did take quite a while for our order to come. But the lattes were nice and hot, and very flavorful.  Our panini arrived later, and was pretty good size. It was finely chopped chicken in BBQ sauce, and some melted cheese. It was tasty, but a bit pricey at $7.99. We had used our 15% Yelp check in discount, so that helped.  Our lattes were very reasonably priced at under $4 for the 12 ounce.   The service here is pretty good. Friendly staff, and they bring your order to your table, rather than yelling out your name. Lattes were really good, and will be back for more soon! Make sure to ask about the free WiFi as well! A definite must in this area."}
{"text":"This is a locally-owned coffee shop that is treasured by the neighborhood. The owners and staff find ways to improve it every month--key features (wi-fi, tv, etc.), decorating touches, and delicious foods. Generous amounts of seating. Delightful atmosphere. Kid-friendly. Work-friendly. Great drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Their teas are usually pretty good and most of their sandwiches (although I do wish we got something extra w/ them for the price, like a pickle or chips or potato salad).  I don't expect high-barista style drinks when I come here (can't seem to make a macchiato at all) but for the basics, they meet the needs.  And the staff is generally super friendly and the owners can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Some of the best-tasting breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! Also love all of the iced and frozen drinks I've tried. Definitely one of my favorite places around for a quick breakfast that's much higher quality than most. Starbucks is only a few minutes away, but I prefer Jolly Beans if I just want an iced mocha or coffee."}
{"text":"After leaving the best espresso in Florida (Oceana Coffee) I thought moving to Portland, OR I'd be sure to find decent m, comparable coffee there.  I was never able to. Fast forward to my moving to the Las Vegas/Henderson area and I've finally found not only great (local!) espresso, but also my elusive coffee cubes.  Jolly Beans cafe understand fresh ingredients, local roasting, and customer service. Service with a smile, always! The best way to start the day! I drive out of my way to get their espresso and coffee cubes every. single. day. And I highly recommend them to any and all who like coffee and good food."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little coffee place. It's situated in beautiful Inspirada and is very close to where I live in Anthem Highlands. The coffee is top-notch and the service was very friendly. The pastries looked so delicious and fresh. I am going to have to head back to try the blueberry scone."}
{"text":"Jolly Beans is the coffee shop and cafe of Inspirada. It is in the center of the community's Solista Park, the wide strip of parkland bordering Via Firenze. As the sole business in the newly built Inspirada community, the coffee shop and cafe relies on the local community and word of mouth for business. The signage that coffee shops take for granted is nonexistent here. Jolly Beans has to abide by the strict development guidelines of Inspirada. With that said, if it weren't for Yelp I would be unaware that it exists and would not have been looking for it when I hiked the trails winding through Inspirada. As a matter of fact I would of mistaken it for a community office.     Always up for a quality cup of Joe, I took some time out from the chili December weather to relax in a community coffee shop and cafe. Where it looks small from the outside, it is a roomy business inside that includes two seating areas with the counter in the center. I walked into a Christmasy scene where a Christmas tree and decorations were an inviting welcoming. This is the smaller seating area with a couple of sofa seats and counter seats. As I progress further into the building leaving the small panhandle seating area, I was enveloped in an electic environment. There was a wooden floor (could be imitation) bordered by grey walls adorned with famous suspension bridges. The tables carried the wooden theme of the floors. On the tables were interesting knickknacks including an owl. The wall on the right featured a community board with all the events and happenings in Inspirada. There were complimentary board games to play and magazines to peruse. I'd make use of the complimentary WiFi.  The one thing missing inside were restrooms. The restrooms were in the connected building to the right near the outside patio that includes a mini Henderson public library in a box.      Jolly Beans offers a diverse menu. The offerings include coffee, smoothies, sandwich wraps, Chad latte, mocha tea latte, paninis, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and pastries.     Their offerings now include a $2.49 bowl of chicken noodle soup. Plus there is a 15% off Yelp check-in offer. It is interesting how a $2.49 came out to over $2.60 with a 15% Yelp check-in offer. Oh well!  It was a decent chicken noodle soup in a small to go cup.     The main thing that brought me in the doors was a small cup of coffee. I call it the mystery blend owing to the fact that I have seen zero reference to the brew they use. It is a delectable mystery blend.     Spending time here was enjoyable. I really felt like I was spending time in a small community in another valley far away from Las Vegas. When you look at the neo-traditional urban design of Inspirada where porches face Via Firenze with cars placed in garages off alleyways, Jolly Beans was time spent in a small community coffee shop.      I am rating Jolly Beans 4 stars for a few reasons. First, Jolly Beans provides a necessary service to Inspirada that is a third place coffee shop for locals to meet up. Second, without a  physical advertising presence it needs a justified good word of mouth. And third, Jolly Beans is a Jolly good coffee shop and cafe. ."}
{"text":"Finally something occupied those retail spaces. Had a mocha and my daughter the hot chocolate. Really good. She's already planning her friend's visits around this place."}
{"text":"Perfect little spot for a perfect cup of coffee.   The day I visited there were two guys behind the counter that were really friendly and pleasant to talk to. I just sold my home and I'm buying in Inspirada and I liked the fact that this was tucked away for the residents that live there to enjoy. I'm sick of big corporations with subpar coffee like Starbucks and I frequent small independently owned coffee shops whenever I can and this place will be a staple of mine."}
{"text":"Friendly little place. Expensive and slow if you want to eat. Super uppity, considering the new cool \"homes\" around there. LOL Location location location. I hope they make it, there is nothing around there, so the people are kind of stuck.  Coffee was great sandwich was OK"}
{"text":"It's very convenient for me as I live in Inspirada, but the service is simply awful. While the employees are friendly, orders take a ridiculous amount of time. I frequent this place weekly and each week it gets worse. Today, my 2 iced coffees took just under 30 minutes. I would love to be able to stop in before work but just don't trust that I'd be able to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Espresso drinks are good. I do wish you had more options like s'mores or Nutella.I waited over 30 minutes from inline to getting my food ,for 1 espresso and a empanada. My last visit my order for a large Carmel was 475 for a large then extra shot-was a little under 7$.  I also like their empanadas but I personally feel they are overpriced."}
{"text":"Always good, our cute cozy Inspirada Cafe.  All the coffee and food is so good!  Love the omelette station on weekends too!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place tucked away in Inspirada next to the park.   The place is small and quaint. D√©cor is cute. They have a little corner with things for littles ones to do, like books, games, a chalk board, and a ball. There is also a little couch, which came in handy because I had my sleeping grandson with me. He got a nice little nap.  I ordered the veggie pesto wrap, and an iced chai latte. Neither were that great honestly. The wrap was okay, the veggies were fresh. It was lacking \"umph\" though (however you spell it!). Nothing comes with the wrap, like some sort of a side, which I thought for $7+ was kind of weird. My mom ordered the clam chowder, and got some super dry plain white toast as a side. The chai latte was pretty bland. Nothing special. If I go back, I will be getting something else.  Just okay overall. The bathroom is outside and is the nasty park bathroom. I do like that it is located right next to the park, so we went to play after."}
{"text":"Quaint, cozy and family run, those are my favorite things about this place! The BBQ chicken panini and the smoothies are also some of my favorite things to order!!"}
{"text":"Jolly Beans is everything I can ask for in a coffee shop!!!  They serve a variety of coffee, tea, smoothies, pastries, sandwiches, paninis etc. I love the Panini's sandwiches especially the BBQ chicken is warm, crispy bread with a distinctive crunch and the gooey cheese. I only know two other cafes that make awesome paninis like Jolly's but they are not in close proximity.   Jolly Beans location is in the middle of Inspirada's Solista Park, it allows easy access to residents. The cafe inside is pleasant, warm, and spacious it's perfect for beautiful days like today. The customer service is outstanding, the staff are kind and courteous people.  This is such a novel idea, I wish I had cafe as cool as Jolly's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and smoothies place. Everything we had here was great and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"This cafe makes Inspirada an awesome place to live. I've never lived in a little community that had its own coffee shop! I went to check it out the other day and found that they have GREAT options. I got a coffee but unfortunately I have celiac and couldn't  have most of the food because of the gluten, wheat etc. The barista went out of her way to make me a cold turkey sandwich wrapped in fresh lettuce leaves! GLUTEN-FREE! They have vegan and vegetarian options as well. The sandwich was SO GOOD. They should just put that gluten free option on the menu. Ambiance was cozy and friendly. Can't wait to get out of the house and do some work at the local cafe."}
{"text":"Despite many requests for larger cups, the owners insist nobody else wants them.  The coffee is okay, but 4 sips and you're done.  They really need to get larger cups if they want to continue charging Starbucks pricing."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and gave this place an early morning try on my way to moving out last of my belongings from old apartment. Got a hot black coffee and a macho tea latte. Coffee was perfect; hot and black. Wife said matcha latte wasn't sweet enough. They probably would have added sweetener or sugar if I asked, but I didn't, so that's my problem with my wife not theirs. Food there on the menu sounded good will try next time. All in all 4 star experience so far. Will update next time I go back and try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Went in today after the Farmers Market and had the Vegan cheeseburger with provolone cheese. It was really, really good! Its hard to find good vegan food in town and this place does it well! I was a little bummed they were out of vegan cheddar and I wish they offered a side . Perhaps some sort of chip or salad?   I like that hey had little game boards to play if you're with a group of people. They do seem a little understaffed for Farmers Market days, though I can imagine the stuffing levels are perfect on any other day there isn't a giant event going on next door.   Happy to have great vegan food so close to home. I hope they expand their menu."}
{"text":"Saw an article about this place in community paper so decided to check it out. A little farther drive than I thought so unfortunately may not come back. I had a vanilla cappuccino which was very good, although I wish they would be given it to me in a mug like some of the photos I saw on here. We did say we were staying there and it wasn't to go, so not sure why I got it in a paper cup. my husband got just black coffee which was good as well. We both got a breakfast sandwich which were very tasty and my husband a blueberry scone that he said was delicious as well. It was nice and roomy inside so great for the people that live in this community. Wish we lived closer because I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Jolly Bean caf√© is a nice, quiet hangout, but their service is not 100%. The barista is always kind, but the owners are not as friendly. You could never tell they were the owners if they weren't their all the time. Their smoothies are great for a hot day and my personal favorite is the mixed berry. If you don't like smoothies than I suggest the real fruit lemonade. I have never had their food, but they do have a great selection of drinks. Their size small is definitely great but the size large seems to be cheaper per ounce. In my opinion their small drinks are overpriced, but they are worth it every now and then. Their environment is very homey because of the board games and homework friendly expandable tables."}
{"text":"Pretty friendly staff. Not bad breakfast sandwiches. The eggs were on the cusp of being overcooked, you know when they turn greenish blue in the center.   Prices were alright, a bit high for certain things. Cute place though to come and hang out over a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The bao (bbq pork steamed buns) are amazing. The staff is so accommodating- great place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! I've lived in anthem for three years. I have no idea how long jellybeans has been open. But found it for the first time me other day because of a craft fair my mother was entered in. Great location, cute interior, good selection, service was a little slow. I might recommend an extra employee in during busy times, like a craft fair. Overall a great experience."}
