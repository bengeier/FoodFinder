{"text":"This place is horrible. I recommend to never buy anything from here. I went to there store on Wilson and Bathurst and wanted to purchase there Filipino dessert called yema. I bought 3 boxes and when I went home to try it, it was rock hard. Then I checked the expiry date and it was expired in Jan of 2017. How could any food shop sell an expired item especially when it's been 2 months!"}
{"text":"We come to this area at least once a month. It's true it's hit and miss. Some days dinuguan's great and there are days it's too sour. It depends on the cook I guess. The serving is too small for the price. There are times I leave totally annoyed that the owners/workers just don't care how the food should taste and how it's served. They're popular and that's it. And if you have a vicinity card, God it never works !  I love that they do offer free coffee or soup when you dine in. I like their cassava and the yema cake. Other entrees are so so. If service would improve I would totally increase my number of visit."}
{"text":"Omg I went out of my way to look for Filipino food, saw FV Foods & decided to go, 1st hard place to find parking.  The BBQ was ice cold & hard, like it wasn't cooked long enough & the adobo was bland.  Couldn't even finish nor enjoy the food.   What a waste of my hard earned money, so disappointed!!  Bought this round ball on a stick, that was even worse, it was so hard you couldn't bite into it, had to throw it out.  I will never recommend this place nor eat there again."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer because I enjoy the food, and find many of my Filipino groceries here, but find that the cashier is very unwelcoming and rude."}
{"text":"I visit here often.  I want to give a higher star but in truth its hit and miss.  Some days the pork bbq is fresh and juicy.  Other days its hard and dry.  I do like their pork and chicken siopao.  For the price you're getting a lot of filling.  Highly recommend the turon.  I always get laing as well but its also hit and miss.  Some days it was undercooked and the taro leaves were tough and lacked salt.  But that was just once.  I've ordered it several times and its been ok.  Pan de sal is okay too.  Has improved since they started.  I wish they were more consistent because the food quality is great and flavours are good but I don't want to drive all the way from Pickering just to get so-so food.  Whenever I'm in Scarborough I make it a point to visit them to pick up my good ol' Filipino indulgences."}
{"text":"Had a number of items here including their pandesal and some of their sticky desserts which were all very good.  I have yet to try their hot food items so I'll update my review accordingly.   In the meantime, I just wanted to point out the fact that I had bought an Ube Cake on the weekend (Sunday), had a slice yesterday and the bottom layer was completely covered with mold.  I have had cakes from many other bakeries before and never have I had one that got that moldy so quickly.    I would suggest for you to ask them when the cakes were baked before purchasing and if possible, check the bottom of the cake first for any molding."}
{"text":"nice filipino store / food... BUT the line up is always long and slow.... poor service. They sometimes ignore you if they cannot handle the crowd anymore.."}
{"text":"I'm giving this store a 2 star solely because of their food and its accessibility.   First off,  I ordered sago't gulaman and pork skewers.  The sago't gulaman was fine for the price of 5 bucks but it was a tad sweet and for those who doesn't like sweet stuff this isn't for you.   The pork skewers on the other hand is so dry and so small for a 2.50 price per skewer. I believe that they had cooked it earlier and let it stay under the heating lamp for the whole day.   but,  the most disappointing part is their customer service.  The counter servers mostly talked to each other and never pays attention to incoming customers,  you literally have to yell so they notice you.  The saddened part is the person on cash which was by far the rudest person I have ever met.  When I asked if they had turon (fried wrapped banana) she looked at me annoyingly and said \"if there's nothing on display,  then we don't have it\".   Lastly,  some of the food were good,  their pancit,  palabok,  menudo but some of it were just swimming in oil, such as the dinuguan and adobo."}
{"text":"Their ensaymada (kind of like a brioche on steroids) that is filled with ube (I have no idea what you call this bread in English but \"ube\" is purple yam in English) is amazing. Some other breads and Filipino baked goodies and desserts are good enough and some subpar, this place however do not check what they have in their shelves, Some of the shit they sell already has mold in it. Gross. Their takeout food is gross by the way, so don't even bother. Just go for their desserts."}
{"text":"Everytime I step into FV Foods, I really do feel happy.  I really do like the grocery section they got going on at the back of the store. Tons of snacks and bakery goods to choose from! The environment here is always roaring with people as I have never been to FV Foods when it wasn't jam packed with hungry Filipinos.  Going over to the dine in or take out food, which are on steamed trays. The food is really nothing to rave about. Which is why I bumped it down to 3 stars. When I dine out for Filipino food, it's always one of two things. I need to feel at home, and I get disappointed when I spent money on food that I could've just made myself at home. A majority of Filipino food is that homey, comfort food, and I just don't get it from FV.  But then again, their food is only half the reason they are up and running. Like I said, they've got a great grocery going on as well!   I've been to quite a few Filipino take out places like this one, but FV will always have the upper hand because of a vast selection they have."}
{"text":"The server pass on as when it has a line up  So she took the person behind us when supposedly to serve us, what a experience and this it the location in Wilson and Bathurst   There food dint taste like the one in Mississauga  And location in Mississauga is a more friendly place   Than this place awful its Salty"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for a wedding and checked this place out to get our Filipino food fix. The place was nice and clean and the area to eat is up to date though could feel that you are surrounded by merchandise. This is typical order your food from the counter and they are all displayed out. The service was good and the folks over the counter was very polite.   Now to the food. We ordered fried Tilapia, pork adobo, dinguan and bopis. With the exception of the Tilapia the rest were VERY salty. I spent a good amount of my childhood in the Philippines and adult life around the SF Bay Area so I had my share of  variety of Filipino food and this place by far is the saltiest."}
{"text":"FV Foods is a Filipino grocery store that has a bakery and they also serve hot food (fast food style).  My parents and I had lunch here recently.  This location has a nice eating area and there's free coffee (serve yourself).    None of the food is labelled, so I had to point and ask what everything was.  I'm sorry that I don't know the names of any of the dishes, so I'll just describe them.  We got 2 combos that came with 2 meat choices and rice or noodles ($7.99 each) and then we got 6 spring rolls and a beef empanada.  This was enough food for 3 people.  For one of the combos we got a beef stew that had five-spice seasoning in it and another beef stew that was tomato based with white rice.  For the other combo we got a dish that was shredded banana blossoms with ground pork and a dish that was squid with white rice.  Overall I found the food flavourful and tasty, but way too oily.  So for the rice, they rub oil into a bowl, then they scoop the rice into the bowl and press it in, then the flip they bowl upside down onto your plate and you have a perfect smooth mound of rice.  Looks pretty, but now the rice is so oily!  The tomato-based beef stew was really oily too.  It had carrots, potatoes, peas and green peppers in it along with big chunks of beef.  This would have been tastier if it was less oily.  The five-spices beef stew was less oily and had no vegetables in it other than onion.  The beef was tender.  This was my favourite of all the dishes we had.  The shredded banana blossoms with ground pork had a sour taste to it.  It was unusual, not in a bad way, but not a taste I am used to.  Worth trying if you are adventurous.    I did not try the squid because it did not look that appetizing.  My parents liked it though.  They said it was soft and not chewy at all.      The spring rolls (2 for $1) are tiny.  They are called lumpia.  Maybe the size of my index finger (little girl hands here, my glove size is 6.5).  They were crispy and filled with ground pork.    The beef empanada ($1.50) was filled with ground beef, potatoes and raisins (!).  The pastry tasted like it had a lot of lard in it.  Too greasy for my liking.  And the pastry to filling ratio was way too high.     They also had Dalandan (Philippine Orange) and Calamansi (Philippine Lime) Sodas ($1.50 each).  I had a can of the Dalandan soda.  It tasted like an orange crush, but less artificial tasting.      We also got 2 steamed buns to go (they are called siopao).  We got one chicken and one pork ($1.50 each).  The meat inside is shredded and too salty for my taste.  Shredded meat is the only filling, no vegetables or anything else.  The steamed bun itself was good, soft and fresh.  We also got a leche cassava cake ($2.50) to go.  The leche part on top was similar to flan and the cassava cake on the bottom was nice and chewy.  I really liked this.  I would buy it again.       The food was good, albeit oily.  The staff were nice.  The place was cleaner than most Filipino grocery stores I've been to in the GTA.    They have free parking in their lot, but the parking lot is not that big and with all the snow it was not that easy to get in and out of."}
{"text":"First time visiting this franchise location as part of the first annual Taste of Manila festival at Bathurst/Wilson.  Festival crowds lining up for food at the outdoor booths were insane, as they were inside FV!  The line started outside the door, snaked all the way around the grocery aisles on the right hand side and finally allowing patrons to order as they passed the hot tables, checking out while still hanging right.  We ordered some items to go...two small palabok, two prepackaged pastries, two fried bananas and two halo halo.  Service was super fast and organized, especially given the crazy festival crowd!  Fried banana was so crispy still, even after our drive home.  The halo halo was just delicious as it should be, loaded with the usual variety and at a good portion size.  Pricing was very reasonable too.    FV has a nice spread for dine-in (a few booths and tables available, looks like they offer a $9.99 buffet option as well) take-out or takeaway for potlucks, home meals or parties.  Our family loves the leche flan and puto for special family holiday events.  Definitely recommended for homesick Filipinos and all those who appreciate Filipino cuisine.  Great job!"}
{"text":"The wait is too long, less staff to tend customers specially on Saturday mornings. That is not a typical  Filipino fast food restaurant should be. Needs service upgrade. Other foods are too salty."}
{"text":"Sunday..excited to eat BBQ in this branch but was dismayed when the BBQ is cold and hard, as if it was like a yesterday once more thing. Are you making customers like idiots? Same thing in Lawernce branch, the dinakdakan I bought was cold and amoy panis. Please watch out what you are preparing before someone gets sick and you get into trouble. Food in Sampaguita of Jollytops is far more better.  In Sampaguita it will be served freshly cooked. I am craving for Pinoy foods...FV wake up, tend to the complaints of your patrons or else no ones gonna eat there. Just a frank and friendly reminder. Walang personalan."}
{"text":"The young lady behind the counter has so much attitude. Otherwise the food is good. Service is superbly horrendous!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years! You can order instant hot pandisal, foods that are cooked fresh and go grocery shopping all in one! I also order cakes from them whenever we have a family party,  The flavors for their cake are as follows they have an ube cake, ube macapuno cake, buko pandan cake, three layer with ube, vanilla, and mocha, mocha cake. The most popular one with my family has to be the Ube Macapuno and the Buko Pandan cake. The most recent order was for my Nanay's/Inay's 80th birthday. I was so happy to hear that Fv Foods would still take my order even on a holiday they would remain open. My cake was ready for pick up at 10am and it was beautiful.    Recieved a phone call back on July 6 2012 to call them back regarding a cake that was ordered for July 1. As I mentioned above my family enjoyed the cake and we go back there every time we have a party.  Anyway the young lady on the phone had questions to ask me regarding the cake and her first question was if I had a problem, I answered No, her second was if there was a distinct smell or taste, I said No just Ube Mac, her question did concern me so I then I interrupted and asked was there a problem with the cake? She answered no there shouldn't be but we are contacting our customers in compliance with another customer who complained of taste and smell and that our cake was the other half of the slab of cake that was used to make our Nanay's/Inay's cake. I told her that our cake did not taste or smell funny and laughed a little because we received requests for more cake after the party, but of course it was all done. I thought this was nice and refreshing not all business' would admit they had a problem and was trying fix it if there was. She mentioned to me that its a huge concern for her since there were 30+ cakes ordered for that day and the day before. The cake decorator was organized and remembered who \"shared\" what in slabs of cakes and noted it on his copies of the order forms. Anyway kudos to Fv Foods for excellent customer service!  2 pictures were uploaded on here in reference to my Nanay's/Inay's cake its the purple one with Happy 80th Birthday Inay."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon, the place was a little busy. Picked up some 3-in-1 coffee and some snacks and frozen food, then decided to get some hot food as well. The line-up for the cash was soooo long and service is really really slow. I wish that they had a separate counter for people who would only buy groceries, as I can imagine they would have to wait in the same line as the people buying hot food. My husband got the siopao asado, and I must say, there was not a lot of filling in it. It was mostly bread and I am not impressed.  My husband also got 2 pork bbq sticks and 2 beef bbq sticks. They were not as meaty as the ones we get at Jolly's Grill In. They are tasty, yes, but the ones at Jolly's Grill In are much better because of the serving size and the flavour.  I was craving for some hopia ube, and was disappointed as the hopia ube was hard, and just like the siopao asado, there was not much ube inside the hopia. It was mostly bread, and was hard to bite. Yikes!  Over-all, I think I could give this place one more try, maybe try other hot foods, but so far the ones I got were disappointing, but since I was born Filipino, I knew I could never resist the taste of home!"}
{"text":"I had the ginataang bilo bilo, I think, in a small size, for $2.99. It's a dessert made of coconut milk, glutinous rice balls, sago, and some kind of starchy fruit or veggie. It was also purple colored (ube/purple yam?) Whatever it was, it was delightful, when mixed with a bit of milk. Undiluted, it was super thick and fairly sweet. The chewier glutinous rice balls provided a nice contrast to the slippery sago, and the coconut milk and ube mix was lovely in a sweet and savory sort of way. The small size, mixed with some milk, is enough for four decent sized servings, so price-wise, it's not bad.  Why the three star review? For those like myself who are unaccustomed to Filipino food, one has to ask what everything is, because while they have an ordering menu above their hot table, none of those items has descriptions, and none of the hot table foods has a name plate. I wouldn't gripe so much about this if my server would have cheerfully let me know what everything was, but she didn't seem to keen on doing that. I have come at times where the server is cheerful, so I have only deducted one star for that.  The other star's deduction is because some of their menu items are really not cheap. Chicharrons were $7.99/half lb. That's almost $16/lb. For that price, I could get some really nice steaks. Is pork skin really that expensive? I think not.  I will be back for more desserts though. They have some very interestingly colored, and flavored, cakes in the display window."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of FV Foods in questionable. Sometime last year, they moved their products to the basement. I remember when the cashier moved the reciept printer, many cockroaches crawled out from the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Discovered this multiple-personality Filipino eatery/bakery/grocery store in Scarborough during the Taste of Lawrence street festival (it's located along that strip).   Quick, clean, and convenient. I was impressed with the quantity and fresh quality of hot foods available - including empanadas - as I arrived at opening time. A Tagalog romance played out its heartbreak on a flatscreen TV while I made my selections. :)  I gravitated toward my favourites - palabok, pork BBQ skewers (heavy, sweet, salty like it was meant to be - ma sarap!), calamansi juice, and Filipino-style spaghetti sauce (reminds me of visits to Manila as a kid) for home. Many Filipino desserts to choose from too - I got ube hopia. Everything hit the spot for me. Enjoyed my visit, and will be back.  There is a neat seating space by FV's large windows, overlooking Lawrence Ave and the parking lot - ultimate suburban experience. :)"}
{"text":"Super slows service!!!  The take-out counter lineup is always crawling.  I don't understand why it takes so long to scoop food into a container!  Prices are fair, but don't go and expect fast food, you'll be standing in line for a while before you actually get your combo!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service, and even though the girl serving me was in training, her manager was too busy giving her dirty looks and making her feel stupid rather than helping her out.  Prices are great, but the toppings in my noodles (palabok) were almost non-existent.    The cashier rolled her eyes at me, no thank you or the warm greeting or farewell that Filipinos are supposedly known for.  It's an embarassment and a poor reflection on the Filipino community.  If you're in the industry of serving customers, you have a long way to go guys.  If you want decently priced average food and don't care to be treated like crap, go here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews. FV is a Filipino staple in Scarborough in the Filipino community.   The top 2 things to get here are the fresh hot pandesal and sisig. Order it when you enter the store as you look around and/or order food so by the time you get to the cash your dozen should be ready. Also on Sundays, be sure to try out the sisig. I personally make a sandwich using the pandesal and put the sisig in it. Delicious!   Other dishes that are consistently tasty are the palabok, chicken bbq on the stick, crisy pata and the steamed puto.   I kind of stick to those items and feel that everyone has there favourites. Filipino food is so diverse and flavours are so customizable, it's really about finding your favourites.  I would however double check the expiry dates on some of the shelved items as you should also practice at any other grocery store."}
{"text":"I tried there halo halo is okay but the customer service here sucks. If you dont speak tagalog, dont expect your order to come till 10 mins later"}
{"text":"Got here last Saturday night to have our Dad's birthday dinner since we are also craving for some Filipino food. We were so excited to eat here since it's our first time. We had the group grilled meal that is served in banana leaf. We didn't waited that long for the food to be serve and dig in as soon as it's in our table since we are really hungry. The veggies are fresh and the fruits as well and the rice maybe. But everything else is so dry and seems like they just reheated everything. It was so disappointing since we expected it to be really good. But man! The squid is so disgustingly soft already. Not soft because it was cooked properly but soft because it's been a while since it's been cooked. The fish is so dry you can see it in the flesh. I swear we're never gonna go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Ok, it's been a little under 3 years since my last rant on this place and fate ignites a reevaluation.  Somehow the cooks have managed to lure  me in after a surprise visit of a girlfriend of mine. She brought us some spaghetti and pandesal (sweet buns) and after an afternoon of 'chikachika' (mindless chatter about life, gossips, struggles and successes while bonding through eurekas and \"I know, she's such a britch!!!!\" moments) I realized it was FV's spaghetti that made the moment worth taking back my negative review!!!!!  I bought me some more spaghetti ofcourse only to witness an even better costumer service and maybe a forced smile but the effort was noted!   They've added a few more main dishes and desserts that I have yet to try. I'm always happy to see establishments revamp service and food quality like they mean it because it truly shows!!! Passion and hard work bring in the costumers!  Thanks FV!!!"}
{"text":"'3 stars mostly coz of the food. You get a variety and it is delicious and authentic. Plus it comes in a decent portion. I don't really recommend the buko pandan mostly because I have tasted way better at parties. Honestly if you can make it it will be way better (just try it). Food I can recommend are the palabok and the lechon (deep fried pork).   Aside from the food you can buy various filipino grocery items from longanisa to bangus and other items.  2 star deduction:  1) service. The place was built with the intention of serving th3 filipino community. That is great; however, if a customer does not look filipino, don't start talking in tagalog. I look Indian but I understand tagalog (and can reply back) decently.  2) this is not a place for dine in.  Sure there are a few tables but things will get crowded really fast. Best to just do take over OR eat if you are a party of 1 and won't stay long.  If you are looking for authentic filipino food, decently priced, and good portions, the  sure do a take out from here. For a decent sit down (like a date, if you are dating a filipina, or an outing with friends) go to an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"BEWARE guys!!!! Wt**** FV!!! Why do you overcharged so much!? 9.99 plus 13% tax for a soap and why do you cover up some of the words with white stickers? I'm still shocked why you charged so much when other filipino stores only charged for the same product for 5.99-6.99? And please check your baked goods because some of them have molds and people who buys don't always see that till they get home or just few days later after it's bought. You better be reading this and do something if you don't want to be reported."}
{"text":"This is the nicest FV Foods location I have been to and matter of fact might be the best Filipino's bakeries, hot table, grocery all in one place I have been to in Toronto!  Eating the Buko Pandan Salad ($2.50) as a takeout  while writing this review is definitely enjoyable! I don't know why it is call a salad, but it is really a traditional Filipino dessert and is really tasty!  Here at this FV Foods you can pick up everything really authentic freshly prepared Filipino treats and they even have a hot table if you want to get some hot food to eat in the small eating area or order a party tray for dinner.  Just be warn, this place can be quite busy...as I feel like half of the Filipinos in the here were here.. I even ran into a few of my friends!!  They accepts cash, debit and credit!  Back to eating my SALAD!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Had a party of 75 people and ordered a cake 2 weeks in advance. With only 2 days notice they called us and said they are unable to make this order! All they did was say sorry and give us a small cake that was old! Never coming back to this place EVER!"}
{"text":"When talking about customer service! FV food really SUCKS at it. When inside the store one day, talk to one of the owner it manager, he told us to WAIT instead of helping us. He just talk in his phone and didn't event call one if his employing help us. Went to the food counter to get some help. They also said WAIT. the place was not that busy. Employees are pushing, pointing each other and arguing who's going to help us with the service. I also notice that some of them don't wear hairnet. Talking about food safety. I say health Canada should drop by and see how this place work. This place don't deserve one F*cking star."}
{"text":"So I'm not really one to leave reviews here on yelp but after my visit a few days ago I feel like I really need to. Went there with my parents and at first I thought the place was great, I love the grocery part of the store and really like the hot food section. However the problem I do have with this place is the experience I had when I was at the cashier paying for my food. As she was ringing everything in on the computer I look down at the countertop and notice a big fat cockroach that was squashed and killed. My problem isn't necessarily the cockroach problem especially considering most restaurants in the city have infestation problems. I do however have a problem with the cashier not cleaning it up so customers don't have to see it. It's not like it was even hidden it was out there in the open. With all of this being said they do have a lot of food that's not covered and sitting out not under the heat lamp. If the place does have a cockroach problem which im sure they do they should be very careful with food sitting out not fully wrapped.  Definitely will not be coming back"}
