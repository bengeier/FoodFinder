{"text":"Food is so so and greasy. Service has a lot of room to improve. Owner nickel and dime on our rice orders. Not a very smart move. We're certainly not returning."}
{"text":"We ate at this place September 28, 2014.

When we arrived, other customers were leaving from a round table for 8.  We had 7 people in our party.  They refused to give us the vacant table for 8 and squished us into a seating of two tiny tables jammed together.  

The table for 8 remained vacant throughout our meal and was vacant as we left.   Meanwhile, two other tables for 8 became vacant and they refused to let us move, saying those tables had been reserved, even though we also had made reservations for our party of 7.  

So during our meal, this restaurant had 3 vacant tables for 8 while we sat squished into an uncomfortable seating arrangement consisting of two tiny tables jammed together.  When our party of 7 left the restaurant, they had 3 vacant tables for 8.

Poor service accompanied the barely edible food.  Chicken was tough.  Dish of Beef, onions and ginger barely had any beef, almost all onion.  Three-seafood dish only had 2-seafood items.  

Not going here again."}
{"text":"The food is great tasting. Price is fair. I give it 4 stars cause parking lot is too small that sucks bad and seating area is kind of small as well. But the chefs cooking and flavor of food is superb. Recommended place for sure when it comes to taste. Pictures will follow on my next visit."}
{"text":"We would love to eat here more often as we love the Shunde style of Cantonese cuisine.  However, due to the size of the restaurant (small), it is sometimes difficult to get seats if you didn't plan to make a reservation ahead of time.  There is no complaints when it comes to the food, which tastes fabulous.  Service is also friendly."}
{"text":"The awkward location for such a restaurant like this means nothing. Their service is very good, considering you can preorder your food, and skip a lot of waiting time during the busy hours. This is a very clean restaurant and they have some very traditional cantonese food here. All of the waiters that I have met are very friendly and you can call them over anytime for something since they are always have one employee available. 
My favourite dish here is the brass plate steamed chicken (????) I like to mix the sauce with the rice because it adds some very tasty flavouring to the rice.
My parents also really enjoy the pork and lotus root patty (??)
Their complementary desert which is extremely soft tofu with honey is very enjoyable.
Otherwise, this is an excellent restaurant with friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"BEST HOT & SOUR SOUP!

Staff is wonderful, food is very very good, atmosphere is the only negative so we do takeout. 

Salt and pepper squid is pretty top notch, but all their dishes are so good and obviously prepared by someone who loves what they do!"}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner for two which includes: 2 spring rolls, ginger beef, chicken and mixed veggies, special fried rice, and hot and sour soup. Everything was amazing! Tasty and fresh. Tons of food, enough for tomorrow too."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. My last meal here was for CNY 2015. I love this restaurant for their convenient location, but hate their parking situation. The restaurant is attached to a husky station, so parking is limited in the lot as there are also a number of uhaul trucks as well. If all fails, one could always park on the street I guess.

I must applaud this restaurant for the patience level in relation to my experience. As we were unsure of the number of guests attending the dinner, over the course of a week before our reservation night, we had ever increasing guest numbers. They were super accommodating to our needs. Please be advised though that they have no waiting area, so if you're early for your reservation you may be left waiting in the cold.

The restaurant is small and clean, appeared to be very family oriented. Upon being seated, we were greeted in both English and Cantonese. We had been advised to order food ahead of time (menus are available online and can be easily googled). All food that arrived was announced in both languages, which was a welcome change for some of our guests. The pacing of the food was perfect, we never felt rushed throughout our meal, the servers were always quick to check how we were doing as well. We felt very taken care of throughout our meal. To our surprise, everyone left here with glowing complements (which is a rarity when it comes to Chinese food and our group of guests). 

We will always be back as this is the only place we know that serves tofu pudding as a dessert."}
{"text":"Don't let the location mislead you, this is some of the best Chinese food I've had in Calgary. Their Ginger Beef is excellent, not candy coated like at many places but nice and crisp. You get good large portions for the price and it's always ready quickly for takeout."}
{"text":"This is a very weird place for a restaurant let alone a Chinese restaurant. Nonetheless, this is definitely a little hidden gem of the neighborhood. The food was flavourful and portions were fairly large. We had ordered the Peking duck which was a little dry but the portion was larger then elsewhere such as ginger beef in country hills. They loss a star for their small parking lot and a little slow on service. We got our food after another table who sat down after us.

Otherwise don't be scared off by the gas station restaurant, its serving up some authentic Chinese food. Happy munching!"}
{"text":"Time to update my review of Papa Shunde.  For the past 2 years, we've frequented this restaurant and love this restaurant.  The owners and wait staff recognize us when we come.  We love the food here; it's a little different from the usual authentic Chinese food.  They like to dabble in different ways of preparing food.  

Fave items:  

- Pan-fried meat patties with lotus root - served piping hot in a little basket.  Delish!
- Steamed Basa Fillet - very simple dish and steamed to perfection in a soya sauce with a little Chinese wine and sesame oil, garnishe with green onions.  
Now with summer coming, they have a summer menu - 
- Beef with pineapple and pickled ginger - very interesting combination of sweet and sour - garnished with green & red peppers and onions
- Spicy Chicken - cold steamed chicken in a spicy chili sauce - Very very good!
- Steamed stuffed winter melon with the most awesome gravy - ground pork, mushrooms, seasoning all ground up and then stuffed into winter melon rounds, steamed with a perfect sauce.
- We call it Fish Soup - it's fish pieces in a broth with cut-up century egg.  Cilantro & ginger slices are added to cut down the fishiness.
- Beef Rice Noodle in Soya Sauce - we love this dish; comfort food at its best!

Best Dessert if you order from true Chinese items:

Tofu Dessert with sweet ginger sauce or Tau-fu Fah.  So light and fluffy!

Give Papa Shunde a try!  If you have a big group, make sure you reserve."}
