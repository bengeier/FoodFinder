{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place with some friends. The service was great and very friendly but unfortunately was not overly impressed with the food. We got the large sharing plate and added on the beet and cheese salad so got to try a bit of everything. Felt like the flavours were not quite there and everything was was just ok."}
{"text":"Really lovely place. This is real Lebanese cuisines, not fast food falafels. I had the ground beef with pine nuts served over humus and my husband had the lamb. Both dishes were delicately spiced but rich and flavorful. Everything tasted fresh. The recipes are simple but work because the ingredients are uniformly good quality. Even the salad tasted interesting and new.
The service is good and the atmosphere relaxing.
We are both eager to go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"BAM-BOOZLED.
It takes a lot for me to write a negative review. Having worked in the restaurant business for several years, I often give places the benefit of the doubt. 
However, when I leave a restaurant with a not-so-full stomach (or heart) and a bad taste in my mouth from the experience in general - I have to speak my mind.
ESPECIALLY since the reviews on Yelp lead to me make a reservation for 5, in the hopes of enjoying a lovely meal with family who was visiting from out of town.

The hubby and I were very excited when a Lebanese restaurant opened in the neighborhood, as we are long-time fans of the cuisine and have been very loyal to authentic spots in our previous area.

First off, I was shocked and confused by how misleading the reviews on Yelp were. I should have been suspicious, not hopeful, of the many glowing remarks about the food and service. I hate to say it, but after our meal, I seriously considered the reality that the posted reviews were not at all objective and written by people who had some kind of preferential experience due to their acquaintance with the owners or their status on Yelp. Just sayin'.
That being said, my meal at Little Sito was NOTHING like those reviews or my optimistic expectations of what the restaurant would be.

The service was mediocre at best. Again, I've worked for years in the restaurant industry, and am weary of criticism and being a critic. But this was laughable.
He was very nice, very smiley, very much trying to be our waiter - but at the end of the day I was frustrated and annoyed. After our party was seated, I told him we were first time clients (clue) and that we were excited to try the food (clue) and that we'd like to have an idea of the portion size of the menu items to help us decide how much to order. I was told that the entrees were meal size (thanks, buddy) and that ALL the mezes and other items on the menu were a good size & \"totally shareable\", \"everything here is great and shareable!\".
FAIL. Unhelpful is an understatement.
I'm sorry, but the salads and apps that we ordered for the table to SHARE were some of the smallest portions I've ever seen. The \"stuffed\" grape leaves were, in particular, the most unbelievably tiny and terrible offerings. When they were delivered to the table - with great flourish - all five of us looked at the plates in a moment of shock & disbelief. I thought I was being punked. They were four of the TINIEST, UNstuffed vine leaves I've ever seen in my life. 

Also, there was an attempt to fill us up with plates of cheap, chewy pita bread that seemed to be the only thing offered in generous portions.

Sadly, all of our mains were sparse in regards to serving size, and heartbreakingly, not that tasty either. Our group ordered everything from the Shish Tawook, Kibbeh Shaneeyeh, Hushwi to the vegetarian Miriam's Plate. 
As a long-time fan of authentic Lebanese cuisine, everything was MEH.

I will pay any amount of money for almost any amount of food as long as it's WORTH IT. 
If this was a bad night, and we showed up on a particularly crappy Thursday evening, then so be it. BUT, if this is the status quo here, I would hate for other Yelpers and lovers of tasty food in the 'hood to be as disappointed and frustrated as we were by an experience at this place.

Wishing you all good Food Karma."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with family and we all left feeling very satisfied! We tried most vegetarian items on the menu and everything was delicious. I especially enjoyed a halloumi and beet salad and we were all raving about the hummus. The service was great too, very friendly and attentive. As a group of 4 relatively picky and all vegetarian adults, it's not often that we're all left raving about a new restaurant pick but Little Sito is somewhere we'll all be going back to!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot. Service is quick and friendly, ambiance is tasteful and warm, and the food was great! We ordered the Sito Supreme for sharing which I highly recommend doing if you go as a group. You get a chance to taste almost all their veggie options and everything is good! The baba ganoush, fried cauliflower and falafel (maybe the best I've ever had) were standouts. Also ordered the eggplant stew which was super flavourful and perfect for a cold January evening. Great for omnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver and stopped by for a light meal.  We really enjoyed ourselves, great atmosphere and good food and all very reasonably prices"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Initially came here for a private work party but have gone back a handful of times since. The tabouleh is out of this world, I have not liked it when I tried it in the past but I can't get enough of the one here! The platters are perfect to share if you want to try multiple items. Plus their cocktails are really tasty!"}
{"text":"Food is decent if you can ignore the portion size. Menu isn't very large but the variety is good, but I can't stress enough that the portions won't leave you feeling satisfied, at all.
We had the stuffed vine leaves which were flavorful but tiny, barely enough for one person let alone two.
The kebbe saniyyeh was actually a good sized portion, but the tawook was laughable by comparison. Both tasted quite nice, but I'd expect more for the price.
Both come with a side dip (yogurt and tahina respectively), fattoush salad and sauteed potatoes.
Service was good, waiter very cheerful, so that's a plus.
Don't think I'd make the trip to come here again to be honest, but if you're in the neighborhood, feeling peckish (not hungry) and in the mood for Lebanese food it might be worth a shot."}
{"text":"I almost hate to write a review on Little Sito because I selfishly want to keep this little gem for myself.  Not even a year old yet their food is absolutely delicious...there's not one dish that we didn't love. Highlights were the fried cauliflower and the labneh.  I've never enjoyed lamb but I will eat their lamb sausage.  Good prices and ambience.  Service is excellent...warm, friendly and very accommodating of my extremely long list of food restrictions.  This has become my new go-to in the neighbourhood...very excited!"}
{"text":"Was there this week, I was exited due to the positive reviews however I cannot express how disappointed I was.  I had been searching for a Lebanese restaurant in Toronto to match that of a Montreal Lebanese restaurant, Chase.  I was looking forward to a positive experience, unfortunately that was not the case.  The food was under seasoned and bland.  However that was not the worst of it.  The portion side was under whelming.  The waiter told us that the salads and Mezza'd were sharable however that was not the case.  They were extremely small and not worth the price.  I had never scene grape leaves so small and the worst was that the rice was under cooked.
I would not recommend this over priced, lack of flavor and complete disappointment to Lebanese food."}
{"text":"Little Sito.  Big taste.

Also, service was very good.  Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Really nice place with lovely staff. I've been a few times now for birthdays and brunch and it's been a great experience every time! Tons of vegetarian dishes that are great for sharing, and really excellent cocktails. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The shish tawook and halloumi salad were both delicious, and our server was friendly and very helpful. The atmosphere was lovely. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Little Sito is a little gem!
Our group of seven enjoyed a wonderful tasting menu selected by Chef Michelle Bouzide. We started with the Sito Supreme (The vegetarian appetizer platter) comprised of a delicious array of Lebanese vegetarian delicacies. The Mjadra (lentil and rice dish with caramelized onion) and Jido's Delight (flash-fried cauliflower) were outstanding.  

For the meat lovers in our group, the Sito Supreme Deluxe sharing platter with the addition of über-flavourful Kibbeh Saneeyeh (spiced Ground Lamb with  onion, cracked wheat and layered with roasted pine nuts and baked) , Shish Tawook (marinated boneless chicken thigh on rice with fattoush salad and tahini sauce) and Hushwi -ground beef sautéed with onions, pine nuts and spices were all delectable.
 There is a lovely choice of Canadian beer, wine and cider.  A few of us had the Sparkling wine which was a perfect accompaniment to our meal.
 The rice pudding with orange-blossom water and walnuts and Halvah shortbread with chocolate and pistachios made for a divine finale. 

Can't say enough about the warm, cozy service and ambiance.  Gerry was awesome!  (And extremely patient)
Can't wait to go back: A feast for the senses!"}
{"text":"So incredibly good. I had the brunch but will definitely be back over and over again. I rarely ever clear a plate (oops) but nothing was left behind here. The beet and halloumi salad was perfect.  The coriander potatoes were so good that I'm not sure how I'll ever eat regular boring breakfast potatoes again.  The baba gannoujh was so fresh and light tasting.  I can't wait to come back for dinner!

On top of the delicious food, the atmosphere is lovely.  Industrial but chill and relaxing, if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in the hood!
I keep coming back here and also bring friends from out of town here when they visit Toronto. Great food, very attentive staff, and cute cozy hip vibe.

I always mean to order something different, but their Shakshuka is so good I have to order it every time. Highly recommended!"}
