{"text":"As mentioned in other reviews, the service is pitiful and the food is somewhere between bad and really bad. Upon entering I was promptly given a beer menu,  then  promptly forgotten about.  So, after being well into my beer I was finally able to order.  I put in for the Cuban sandwich.  At  this point my beer is gone and in still waiting for a sandwich,  this has been a 20 minute lapse in time.  After the server finally comes back and asks if I want anything, I order another beer and ask if she can check on the food.  The food has now arrived and I'm starving, can't wait for that Cuban sandwich.  Well,  the bread was completely soggy and greasy and the pickles were sweet,  not dill. Gross. Cubans have pork, ham,  mustard and DILL pickles.  This 'cuban' had  pork and those nasty sweet pickles, let's not forget soggy greasy,  not crusty bread. And,  that second beer I ordered,  never came.  Completely disappointing."}
{"text":"This is pub food done really well.  Philly steak sandwich was excellent,BBQ Burger was perfect med rare, was tasty with crisp bacon.  Get the fries, but chips are good, too.  Slow night, but service was there when we wanted, didn't pester"}
{"text":"It never hurts to have another place downtown to go for happy hour.  There's no such thing as too many sports bars in a sports crazed city like Cleveland.  Tower 230 is a nice place with a decent after work crowd as well.  

They could work a bit on their advertising though.  We only found out about it since a friend of a friend works there, however when we told people at work (most of whom live down town) about a sports bar in Tower City no one had any clue that there was one."}
{"text":"I have to absolutely agree with Dave C's review.  After giving this place yet ANOTHER chance, today's experience pushed me over the edge!!  I had to write a review.

I have dined there a few times, just because they have a few lunch specials and I work nearby.  NEVER AGAIN!

Today...another 45 minute wait for our food!  (below average food at that)!   In fact, on more than one occasion, something tasted \"off\".  My co-worker swore the refried beans were spoiled last time we dined there.  Oh...and if you don't want the refried beans, there are NO substitutions---sorry!  Unless of course you want to pay a dollar extra!  This place will nickel and dime you to death!  They charge extra--a lot extra-- for anything you ask for!  Wow...a 1/2 tsp. of salsa with my two tiny tacos?  Gee, thanks!  You want another 1/2 tsp....we are going to charge you.  You want 1/2 tsp. of sour cream with your tacos (the ones that should come with sour cream already)--that's extra.    Ridiculous!  And the long wait---well that honestly has become the norm.  
The poor host was seating people, delivering food and bussing tables.  Slow, slow service and obviously understaffed.  Then...after complaining to the manager and telling him how we have had several bad experices with the food, the add-ons and the super slow service, he gave a disinterested, insincere apology.  We told him that we weren't going to be back, he just said...ok!   Wow...I guess they don't mind losing customers and getting bad reviews!  Save your money....go somewhere else.   This place should close--and I'm sure it will.  I know we will NOT be back!!"}
{"text":"So this is my 3rd time eating here in 3 days so I guess the food is pretty good huh lol..a small deli but has delicious food..the chicken ceaser wrap is a must try here!"}
{"text":"Good service but the food wasn't real good. If your a picky eater you'd probably leave. I hate when you ask for a burger done medium and it comes out burnt. Twice!"}
{"text":"The food downstairs at the 230 deli is great, as is the service. So why is the service so poor and the food so average in the bar & grille?"}
{"text":"We had a rehearsal dinner there a few weeks ago and the place was great! The room was very nice and the food and service couldn't have been better. The manager and staff really went out of their way and the extra mile. We couldn't have been happier with the result."}
{"text":"Used to be Tower 230,that was when the food and drink was great.  Now, I suppose they get 1 star for being open since it's the only thing they are doing right.   Last week, while eating the Friday rib special which includes cole slaw, my dining partner took a bite slaw and a piece of glass was in it.   What a horrific situation that could have been.   What is worse, the Manager wouldn't come out to address the situation, relayed a message through the server that the 1 meal was now free, and blamed it on the bar in the restaurant.   I always thought that food was prepared in kitchen, not the bar.   Apparently, they do things differently there.   If only the Manager could have done the appropriate thing and come talk to us I would go back...... As it stands, they are crossed off my lunch eateries downtown.   And what's with the name, Tower 230 I like, Lincoln Tap House sounds like a bunch of old men with cigars and martinis."}
{"text":"This is my regular Monday lunch spot. Tower 230 has lunch specials everyday and Monday lunch special is a burger and fries for $5. 

There is nothing special about this burger or fries. You get to choose cheese. My choice is always crumbled bleu cheese. The burger also comes with your normal lettuce, tomato, and onions. Nothing special. 

Fries are on a skinny sized cut. Again, nothing special. You can substitute the fries with side salad for additional $1.50. 

Their service is a hit or miss.. Some days, it took almost 40 minutes to bring my burger. Some days, it took shorter time when I sat at the bar. Some days, they never refilled my drink.. 

But nevertheless, you can't beat $5 lunch at downtown Cleveland. I don't recommend if you are in hurry though."}
{"text":"Breakfast line takes forever and has become overpriced. Wait until you get behind the guy with 15 orders for Quicken. Good luck.

Food upstairs is bland - basically salty school cafeteria food.

Good luck calling in an order - they rarely answer the phone from 11-1.

This place is a holdover from old lame Cleveland. I wish a chef and management with some vision with take this place over and do something cool with it."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town my wife and I it's a nice quiet place in the daytime bartender nice highly recommend the old-style beer"}
{"text":"This place is really, really good. Excellent lunch, quick service and great menu. Would love to go there when I can actually imbibe.

The salads, salmon, and even chicken quesadilla were unique and delicious. Oh, and probably the cheapest lunch you'll find downtown!"}
{"text":"Categorically, the worst service ever. If you want to see a waiter more than once in two hours, don't consider this joint!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday night with the Cleveland International Film Festival in town, they turned us away because they didn't have enough staff! The restaurant was not even half full.  Second year in a row! Very poor planning!"}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong...the food was awesome,...but the service was really crappy.  I would definitely give it an easy five stars (fighting between a three or a four). The server I had was a little depressing and had a little attitude and I didn't even want to stay there long.  I had the Cappicola Tortellini which was AWESOME.  They had other yummy menu items that was hard to choose from.  I would definitely go back but I will get my food to go if I see her, lol.  Definitely a cool place in Tower City that you can go to watch a game (football, basketball...whatever)."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times. I don't really like the dining room as the waiters/ waitresses basically suck. (If an owner reads this- fire the whole staff and replace them)
The bar service is amazing though. Happy Hour is great and Matt is great. He will take the time to get to know your tastes so he can recommend the right drink.
The daily specials are all right. For some reason, the wait time for food is much less when I eat at the bar. Funny huh?

You're probably wondering why the 4 stars for somewhere you have to sit at the bar to get service. It is because the bar service really is that great. Even if Matt doesn't remember your name, he remembers your drink. His check backs are perfectly timed and I never find myself waiting for anything."}
{"text":"Ok, this place looks like a bar in an airport terminal..seriously. Don't let that deter you. The boys behind the bar were well-versed in their beer knowledge and were super friendly as well. I got a flight of some beers I had never tried ( I was sticking with the Fall theme) New Holland Ichabod Pumpkin, Rivertown Pumpkin-(so good), Sam Adams Fat Jack, and Ommegang Scythe & Sickle-(fab btw). $5.50 holla! They were all good for the most part. We were such awesome guests that we were given glass beer mugs to take home..bonus! If you love beer, you must stop here..you must!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before a movie. We had calamari and calzones. All were delicious! The seasonings on the calzones were especially delicious."}
{"text":"Service can be iffy here, but the selection and quality of the food is always very good. I love the options on their new menu that came out a couple months ago. One of my favorites is the adult grilled cheese with prosciutto and Gouda--delish! Their fresh chips make a great side, but every now and again, I want some tots and they serve them up deliciously crispy which I love. If you're in a hurry for lunch, this isn't the best option, but if you have a little time to spare, it's a great option."}
{"text":"I usually do not write negative reviews; yet, in this instance I feel compelled to share my thoughts. I have frequented the Lincoln Tap House (not to be confused with the previous bar & restaurant: Tower 230) many times since it opened and it is OK for drinks, but the kitchen is slow and inefficient.

I ordered food there twice and it took almost an hour both times to be served and there were only 6 people in the bar at the time.  Both times the manager promised to \"take care\" of me the next time...never happened.  In fact, the last visit was horrible and I will not bore you with all of the details.  Suffice it to say I will not return

The only way to effectively complain is to not patronize a bar or restaurant, particularly in Downtown Cleveland where over 80 restaurants and bars await you.

Well, wish I had some better news to report, but after 3 strikes, the Lincoln Tap House is OUT and removed from my list.

Happy trails."}
{"text":"The menu is really good.  There is something for everyone.  The beers and alcohol compliments everything.  Staff is very nice!  I typically go here for lunch but I'm sure 'Happy Hour' would be fun as well."}
{"text":"We go to a Cavs game every year and always choose this place only because of convenience. We stay at the Renaissance so we don't have to walk outside. This was our third time here and it's always the same thing. Unorganized, understaffed, and a complete cluster. Our waitress was doing 18 jobs. They were out of most of the food on their menu which I thought was crazy (it was Saturday and there was a basketball game). As soon as our drinks were served, the waitress informed us they were out of pizza, fries, nachos, and about 10 other popular foods. We should've taken a hint after the table next to us left with over half of their food still on there plates but at this time, it was too late to leave so we improvised. Our food was served to us quick, but was Luke warm at best. After that, the waitress was MIA. We wanted to get to the game but we couldn't even find her to flag her down for the check. Finally she brought it and took our credit card, made a comment about how she had never seen a credit card like ours before , and the guests check at the table next to us. She brings us back the wrong card, wrong check, and bolted. So we couldn't even wave her down. My husband and the gentleman at the table next to us had to go to the bar to get everything situated, where the waitress was filling beers. She told us \"she was too busy right now\" and would get to us when she was done. We got the bills sorted out and left. This morning my husband checked our credit card and we were charged three times. Once for the wrong check and twice for the correct. We will never be back. Same story for this place on three separate occasions. Shame because the location is great for us."}
{"text":"We chose to dine at Tower 230 in one of those rare occasions that we were hungry, in an unfamiliar place and this restaurant had seats within view of TVs (on a football Sunday). It didn't take long to figure out why.  Service was superbly slow - there were 2 women working the bar area and there were periods of time (5+ minutes) when they were both missing (when they returned they carried that lovely trail of cigarette smoke with them - you couldn't take smoke breaks apart?!).  We ordered 'tower fries' and a couple of beers. Beers showed up in a few minutes, but after about 30 minutes we decided to just order lunch and asked her to forget about the fries. The fries then showed up 5 minutes later with an apology (and they comp'd them) They were cold and soggy and covered in lukewarm nacho cheese goo. For lunch we had wings and a white pizza.  Wings were OK, I have a hard time remembering anything about them.  We asked for ranch and blue cheese on the side and only received ranch. The celery I would have tossed from my fridge a week ago - not good when you can bend celery in half without snapping it. The pizza was barely edible. The cheese was toasted - it seemed like the pizza had taken a few turns in a microwave and then a flash under the salamander.  So in summary if you want food - I would stay away. If you just want to hang out, get a beer when the bartenders are available and watch sports on TV I would probably still find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's a good place to grab a burger and some tots for lunch.
You won't find inspired food here but it's tasty.
It's more fun to come here for happy hour and have a few drinks.
There is an impressive selection of beer on tap and there are always new seasonal brews."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for lunch with a coworker, the food was just okay, nothing spectacular or savory.  I ordered the chicken caesar sandwich which was dry because there was hardly any dressing on the sandwich and very little asiago cheese.  The dressing seemed to be on the lettuce which was chopped up into small pieces like for a salad which kept falling out of the bun.  I ended up just pulling the top of the bun off and eating it open-faced because the bun was massive compared the small chicken breast inside.  The best part of the meal was definitely the tater tots which were totally worth the $1 surcharge!  I might try this place again for the burger or pizza lunch special since it's only $5.  But the regular lunch prices aren't worth it.  I spend $12.24 with tax and tip for a sub-par lunch. 

Service was decent, not super efficient but not terribly slow either."}
{"text":"Super cool bar, didn't eat here but looked like typical bar food type of eats.  The draft selection was awesome.  Great view out the window and great atmosphere to grab some drinks and spend some fun times with friends."}
{"text":"Two words folks......tater tots.  Great happy hour specials till 8pm too (think it's $2.00 tall drafts). Lunch can get busy but it's always quicker if you sit at the bar. Nice Hi Def TVs too"}
{"text":"We ordered a few beers a pizza, wings and calamari 2 hours before the Cavs game, there was only 2 other tables when we hot there and a half dozen at the bar. Why did it take over a hour for that? The Meat pizza was pretty good. The wings and calamari tasted like they came from Sams club and were microwaved warm. We saw our waiter 2 times to place the order and to pay. It took 30 minutes to get the check. This place is painfully slow and God forbid you want another drink during dinner because it's not happening."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. For drinks, this place would be awesome!! For Dinner? probably not so much, unless you had time to kill.

We went here before an event around the corner at the arena, a good 2 hours before. When we went in, we weren't sure to go down stairs or straight, there's no hostess or signage. We started walking in and a server saw us and asked bar or dining room. We told her we didn't have much time so whichever was quickest. She sat us in the dining room, in her section, as she was our waitress. It started out great. Got an extensive beer/wine/specialty cocktail list. It looked amazing! And we got drinks... and then we didn't see her for awhile.

Finally put our food order in, 2 burgers and a grilled chicken salad to split between 2 of us with extra dressing. And we waited.... and waited... About a half hour later we got our food, one person at a time. Took her 15 minutes to get extra ranch. The salad was nothing to write home about albeit it was huge! and easily splittable. It took another 20 minutes to get the checks, in which case a few times while we were waiting on our waitress, we noticed she was on her phone or just ignoring us. There were a whole 3 tables in the dining room with people at them.

So for drinks great, awesome, go! For food? not so much."}
{"text":"So how about that, I'm updating my review around the exact same time I wrote it last year! I still standby Lincoln Tap House being A-OK if you're in Tower City and need a sit down place, but just keep your expectations realistic if you're wanting a 5-star dining experience.

Gosh, I hate saying it, but the staff often seem overwhelmed and understaffed, regardless of how busy it is or isn't. The host is very awkward. He will see you, but walk away, and you're not sure if he's coming back. There's a mutual feeling of this throughout all the tables... guests anxiously looking for someone to take their check, looking for a server, etc. We usually just end up asking whomever we see if someone can take our order, and whenever we get the bill, we typically pay it right then-- you never know when you'll see someone again. Our table was quite sticky and for a weeknight, I was surprised how dirty the floors were. So, not much to ambience.

I still standby that LTH does decent catering, so I am not sure where the disconnect is with the restaurant. As I mentioned previously, come for a beer, grab an appetizer, and enjoy watching the Cavs. The burgers are a safe bet here, which I think is their stronger suit."}
{"text":"As others have noted, this is really two places -- one upstairs and one downstairs. The downstairs place churns out respectable sandwiches and mediocre soups for breakfast and lunch. The upstairs has a bar, more warm food, and a bigger menu. Neither place is bad, and I wouldn't normally write a moderately pissy review, but my workplace has ordered lunch from here on three occasions that I recall, and all three times the order is messed up. This last time was great. I ordered a burger off their menu and replaced the meat with a black bean patty, which you can do with no charge. The receipt had the change on it. The order had nothing on it. I got a tasty condiment sandwich for lunch. Since this was ordered for a working lunch, I had to enjoy my condiment sandwich or get nothing. Each bite helped remind me to write this review. Three strikes. No more carryout from these clowns. Ever. And it'll be a while before I get that portabella wrap downstairs. That's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here Lincoln Tap House twice. There's a spacious interior, with a variety of seating areas: hightops near the bar and the TV's, numerous booths to the side that are relatively quieter, and a center area that can seat up to . 

Their beer selection is better than an average bar with over 15 on draft and 30 or 40 bottles of craft goodness which are all described and listed on a current menu: Star for that. They also have a rotating monthly special that's not a domestic for cheap, most recently Sam Adams Alpine for $2. 

The bar area is completely wooden with ample seating at the bar and nearby hightops with TVs, a view of Prospect (which isn't much of a view), and big flirts as bartenders. 

They were gracious when I arrived to an event that I helped host (someone else put the reservations together) to find out that they expected 50, not 15. 

The service from the kitchen was slower than I expected for my friends who ordered food. 

Not a bad joint, especially if you want something different than east 4th, west 6th or being connected to Tower City, go a bar hop along the Rapid. Also recommended have a quick beer near tower city after work or are staying at the Ritz"}
{"text":"Before I went here had my stomach set on the chicken and waffels. I checked the online menu 1st. I got there no chicken and waffels. Then I asked about my 2nd choice the lobster rolls....Hmmmmm Not on available either. so I settled for the fish sandwich. It was large but tasteless and the tarter sauce tasted way too sweet. The service was very slow and my lunch partners waited on refills for a while.The saving grace was the price maybe the only good thing. I will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT and so is the bar. The bartenders can recommend drinks and are friendly and fun."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go. Score an Indians or Cavs game. Not as busy as places on E 4th or E 9th so easy to get a table only a few hundred feet down Prospect from those places. There is even valet parking right next door if you want to take advantage of it. PluS, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Prices are awesome on the brews! Very very extremely alcoholic drinks! Strong is the word of the day as far as drinks go! Be the seen here is awesome! But today, there are only two servers and they are doing there best. Drink on my friends...."}
{"text":"This used to be a go to lunch spot but the service has deteriorated over the years. Gave it another try today. We sat at bar at 1:00. No servers anywhere to be seen. Bar area was dirty. Two servers showed up 5 minutes later. Then proceeded to count register for several minutes and left. We waited there for 10 minutes and then left ourselves. Will not return."}
{"text":"Holy moly...this place is so lost. I mean the service is not very good at all and the food is just food. I've been here multiple times since I work near by and some times it's great and other times it's awful. Today happened to be an awful one. We were seated and then waited and waited. And then the host asked us what we wanted to drink, which was very nice and thoughtful of him since he noticed the server hadn't come our way. 

And then we waited and waited and waited some more. It took the server about 15 min to actually get to us. We ordered quickly and then waited some more. It took about 20-25 min for our two salads to come out. I mean did you go to a field of greens to pick out the spinach!? Holy moly....20-25 min for 2 SALADS!? 

Well you can see the whole theme of this post about waiting and waiting some more. I guess go here if you have plenty of time or just enjoy waiting."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place can remain open.  Staff had a difficult time finding a place to seat us - not because it was busy, but because every table was littered with dirty dishes from past guests.  Lobster bisque had great flavor but I don't care for soup that is room temperature.  Sandwich was very greasy but the house chips were delicious!"}
{"text":"Quick service and friendly bar staff. I had the Albuquerque sandwich with sweet potato fries and a Labatt blue. Delicious!"}
{"text":"What I ordered was beyond awesome. I went on a late Saturday afternoon and no one was really there. My server was okay, she spent majority of her time chatting it up with this guy at the bar area (I think as far as customers, it was just the two of us).  Restaurant environment didn't look depressing.  I was a little annoyed with the fruit flies but it wasn't that much of a nuisance. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was ah-may-zing. Pork super tender, seasoned well and not dry at all.  Will definitely go back, super convenient area (Tower City)."}
