{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast or lunch when close to downtown. Very unassuming place. Very Pittsburgh. Dive bar/restaurant with really good food. Excellent service always."}
{"text":"Was walking around the area and noticed rhe \"Serving Breakfast\" so I walked in and ate a delicious 2 egg breakfast and an order of French toast.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Jedlo v pohode, obsluha celkom fajn. Rýchly obed za normálnu cenu. Typická americká kuchy?a."}
{"text":"On a hockey night, you can't go wrong.  We love to go here for a quick bite to eat and a few cold beers before hockey games if we aren't tailgating.  The food is typical bar food, and you get lots of it.  Last time i had the chili cheese nachos and my wife had the chicken strips.  It was just enough that we didn't feel the need to pay the stadium prices for the hockey game."}
{"text":"The dinner from hell.  Under no circumstances should a simple burger take 50 minutes.   The waitress gave our food to a table across the room, which is whatever. However after that she refused to tend to my table or really even make eye contact for a solid 20 minutes. Nearly an hour after we placed our order, she FINALLY brings out a plate. It just happens to be something not even remotely close to my actual order. 5 minutes later I get my actual order.   Some of the worst service I've ever received.   Absolutely never will I go to Souper Bowl as long as I live."}
{"text":"Bar food at it finest!!!! Pleasant servers - great food - favorite spot before an event!!!"}
{"text":"Another smoking bar so beware. I recommend walking up the hill and hitting up the Red Ring before a Pens game instead eating here. If you are just looking for a quick beer, and don't mind smoke, then sure, stop in..........but not if you are looking for a decent meal.   Typical bar food with decent sandwiches. I got the Reuben and definitely had better. My love got the Turkey and Bacon club. It tasted a little better but the white bread looked like the $1 loaf you get on sale from the day old rack!   5-8 Beers on Tap. No micros.   Lets Go PENS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before the Fleetwood Mac concert. Had the mushroom Swiss burger - seriously one of the best burgers I've had in a LONG time. My BFF had the black bean burger and she said it was delicious. Service was pretty good considering the mass of customers inside. Side salad was meh but I'd definitely be happy to come back here before my next event at consol."}
{"text":"Great service. Danielle was awesome. Wings were great.  Everything we ordered was fast even before a pens game when the place was packed. Atmosphere was comfortable for a bar before a major sporting event. Because hockey fans are smarter than any other sports fans. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We stopped here before a Pens game and I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations for their menu but count me surprised. The menu is short and sweet but their staff is efficient and friendly.  I ordered a simple buffalo chicken sandwich, slightly overcooked and not quote enough sauce but a huge portion and very filling. The fries were also good as well.  The prices were incredibly cheap as well even with a couple beer not on special. I'd definitely stop here before a game again... We lucked out and got the last available table on the second floor, but a lot of folks were waiting."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place? I am surprised after reading a few other reviews that some people love it here. Super crowded before any event at PPG, hard to get a drink, mediocre bar food, loud music & no parking. It is also so dated, would it kill them to do a little updating? Every time I go here before an event, I regret it. The service isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great. I went here this Friday for the first time in a while, hoping things would be different,  & waited at the bar 25 minutes and still could not get a drink... we left. I'd recommend one of the other bars in the area over Souper Bowl."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome! Had a few drinks and some appetizers before a hockey game. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We stumbled into the Souper Bowl, along with an entourage of fellow VCU fans, during the A10 Basketball Tournament this past weekend, and my friends and I could not have been happier. The atmosphere was wild (because of the tournament), but the staff handled it with poise. The Souper Bowl was quick, friendly, and fun - essentially everything you could ask for in a sports bar. The staff handled our rowdy group of Richmonders so well that many of us came back three/four times over the course of the weekend.   If you are heading to a game at PPG, looking for solid bar food (killer wings), or just want a reasonably priced drink, this spot is for you."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my meal from Souper Bowl. I called ahead and ordered a honey mustard grilled chicken sandwich for takeout. I asked for the included side to be coleslaw. I also asked to add onion and pickle to the sandwich.   When I went in to pick it up the first 2 employees I talked to had no idea where my order was. When I tracked it down, the bartender who waited on me seemed disinterested in working. I paid my $10 bill, tipped $2, and left. Should have checked my meal first, I suppose.   When I got back to work I found that the coleslaw was missing from the order. There weren't any sides included. They also didn't put the onion or pickle on the sandwich.   The worst part though was the bottom bun was soooo extremely greasy/soggy that it fell apart when I picked it up. There was basically a puddle of grease beneath the bun.   I would have given one star if the chicken and bacon hadn't been as good as they were. The chicken was cooked well, and the bacon was a decent quality.   I would not recommend Souper Bowl for food, and I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great Pittsburgh sports bar feel. Terrible service. AWFUL food. I was almost positive I was going to get food poisoning. Food tasted like it was dumpster dived and heated up in the microwave on high for 30-60 seconds. My suggestion is DON'T EAT HERE. You can do better. Hit up Market Square for food and drinks. Grab one last cold Yuengling here and then head over to the game. I repeat, DO NOT EAT HERE!!  Unless, of course, you enjoy eating microwaved cat food."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE SOUPER BOWL!!!  They make the best grilled cheeses around for cheap! I recommend getting rye bread with cheddar and tomato and home fries on the side!"}
{"text":"This place is a typical cheap dive-y spors bar. It had the feel of an American Legion hall.   I felt much better about my life after seeing some of the regulars there."}
{"text":"Stopped by to watch hockey because of their Labatt specials during games! It's a good spot for watching a game, it's a chill atmosphere and it didn't get too crowded or loud. Bartenders served us quickly. Keep in mind that parking might be tough, especially since it's right next to PPG."}
{"text":"Let me just tell you that my boyfriend and I were wondering thru Pittsburgh. Where could we go for the Penguins game? We walked around for a while and stumbled upon The Souper Bowl. Let me tell you this place is a hidden gem. The food is AMAZING but the best part of it all was our waiter. I'm a waitress myself so I must give credit when it's due. Our waiter ShipWreck was amazing. He was funny, nice, and he made the experience more enjoyable. He did it all. The place doesn't have a hostess so he was doing it all. Bussing tables, making conversations to the 11 tables he was waiting on, taking orders, running food, grabbing beer. He rocked it. He gave us the best service I've had in a while, and he was always on the move. Every single person he waited on even left with a smile. You can tell he loves his job. If you wanna stop for GREAT FOOD, COLD BEER, and even BETTER service then check out the Souper Bowl, and ask for ShipWreck to wait on you!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. My chicken tender salad with house made ranch was great. If your looking for a classy place, this isn't your kind of bar. I love how divey it is."}
{"text":"Went here a bunch of times, all before Penguins games for some beers and decent bar food. And that's exactly what you're going to get here. It gets pretty crowded like an hour before puck drop but that's ok because the location is amazing. It is right across the street from the main entrance to the Consol Energy Center.   The food is good, not great. The beer selection is good, not great. I enjoy it and it hits the spot every time. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a Pens game. Didn't mind the 20 min. wait to get a seat. Finally get sat, order a beer and a water. Waitress comes back and say they don't have that beer anymore. Really, you don't carry PBR!. So i get a Dr. Pepper instead. She ordered the Bacon Bleu Burger and I got the Carnivore Burger. 45 MINUTES LATER!. We get the burgers. Now I worked culinary for almost 20 years, it does not take that long even when your busy. The only positive was the burger. It was really good,  Buger topped with bacon, bbq pulled pork and American cheese. She likex her burger, which had bacon and crumble bleu cheese, except they didnt melt the cheese. And the fries had that crispy coating on them, not very got though, but edible. My 2nd refill on pop came back as root beer? Terrible service. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this restaurant in years, since a. I lived out of state and b. When PA changed the laws they continued to allow smoking upstairs and I'm highly allergic. I found out they finally stopped allowing smoking anywhere inside and decided to try them again.  I attend a lot of Penguins games & concerts and normally go just down the street to eat/drink before the game with friends and family. Since I go straight from work, I'm always the first to arrive. No one else has an issue with seating me alone to wait for the rest of my party. Though the Souper Bowl was EMPTY (so empty that I was wandering around alone with no one greeting me and the next person in the restaurant thought I was the one working) at this time.   Though there was almost no one there (me and this other woman, who took a couple of menus and seated herself), when I mentioned that there were two in my party and we needed to see the Pirates game, the woman weirdly (and rudely) asked if they were THERE NOW... Um... Clearly not. She could see it was just me. I told her I could show her texts and my boyfriend was on his way. The woman next to her (older and presumably higher on the food chain) said something about me being \"that way\" already (which confused me - they were accusing ME of not really having a party of two, making it clear that if I were there alone, which I sometimes am at restaurants before shows no one else wants to attend with me - like the ballet or gymnastics) they would NOT want my business... Anyway, the second woman explained that they didn't seat until the whole party was present. (I can see why - like I said, they were PACKED... NOT.) As I started to walk away, she said they may be able to help me upstairs. No thanks. I went back down the street to The Cafe on 5th where they've never had ANY problem seating me alone (whether I'll later be a table of 2, 4, or more) and treat me very well. I don't need to pay to be treated rudely.  There was a Pirates game before the Penguins game last night, so I'm sure the Souper Bowl was completely packed. However, I attend a LOT of games and I'm just as sure that's not always the case. I'll never return. They clearly didn't care about my business that night, but I am telling all my friends and my Dad and his girlfriend attend a lot of games (and drink a lot), too. He'll stick with the Cafe on 5th, too.  No clue if the food is good or not and I don't care. I'd much rather be treated like a person the restaurant/bar would like to serve than someone they couldn't care less about. The feeling is mutual. Beware."}
{"text":"Imbibed here while in town for the NCAA men's Frozen Four.  Close to Consol Energy Center, fans of each school were here getting lubed up prior to the games (especially given that no alcohol is sold at NCAA events). People left and right were taking full advantage of the Happy Hour shots and Jagerbomb specials. Bar decor was nothing special--kindof felt like someone's basement--while bartenders did a good job of getting to everyone in a timely manner.  Overall, seems like a decent place to grab a beer before heading over to Consol."}
{"text":"The Souper Bowl was the back up bar down the street from our hotel. Anyway, it has the legit feel of a Pittsburgh bar. Yuengling and Iron City beers are available and what's not to love about a Stoli and soda and a Yuengling for $6? Ok, so the limes that were offered with the Stoli were a shocking and alarming shade of brown, but it's Pittsburgh so it's forgiven.   3 Stars for the smoke and sports memorabilia."}
{"text":"This was my place during the last Stanley Cup run! Great specials, good food,& fun place to chill and watch the games! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a fair bowl of Tortilla Soup- tasted like jarred Quaso or Velveeta with peppers thinned down with whole milk-  the grilled cheese with tomato was very good.  Good bar food and fair prices .  The place like much of Pittsburgh is trapped n the 70's but I like it.  We are family."}
{"text":"I've been to the Souper Bowl twice now, once for Lunch which I ate there and tonight I got takeout. At lunch I was able to sit downstairs and ordered the Chicken Salad which was very good. Service was pleasant and quick as well. Tonight when I went to grab my takeout, there was a sign stating the 2nd floor was open.  I figured maybe at night they open up more seating but to my surprise the downstairs was all blocked off and it said employees only.  Maybe they are renovating or something.    Upstairs was another bar and some seating. A decent little gathering of people around 7p.  I approached the bar to see where to pickup my order and the bartender said she could grab it.  Everything was ready to go in under the time the states to me so I was happy.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Diablo Style (they add banana and jalapeño peppers) along with fries and a side of blue cheese all for $10 and some change.  I could smell the buffalo sauce through the bag and container so I knew this was going to be good.  Not only was it delicious but the sandwich was huge along with a bunch of fries. Good value here.  And the chicken was and actual white chicken breast which was then breaded. You had to bite against the grain other wise you'd pull the whole thing apart. None of that imitation junk here. There is also something very appealing about their fries that I can't put my finger on.  Almost like they have a slight coating on them. I highly recommend you give this a shot the next time you are near the arena."}
{"text":"Souper Bowl is a stereotypical Pittsburgh bar in every amazing way. Friendly staff, decent beer specials, and good pub grub.  It's become a staple for myself and friends before concerts or Pens games.  It can get extremely busy before events, so arrive early. On the plus side, you'll be able to save yourself a few bucks from expensive arena prices. All the food I've had has been good. I like to judge a bar food by their chicken fingers and french fries. Both are delicious.  If you want a real Pittsburgh feel this is the place for you! :)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh. We stumbled upon this place during our time in Pittsburgh for the A10 tournament due to its proximity to the PPG arena. My friends and I loved it so much that we continued to go back. The food is actually really good. Some of the best fries I've ever had. The bartenders were awesome. Quickly learned my name and my drink order. They were super friendly with a good sense of humor. Even with our group constantly chanting, they didn't seem bothered at all. I can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again just so I can stop by here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was right before the Penguins game. I honestly didn't know what to expect. Drunk bros, loud music, packed house? It was not like anything I imagined. It was full but not packed and more of a family atmosphere than a frat club. Not what I thought when I came in and not what I expected before a Penguins game. I was surprised and would come here again just because of the atmosphere.  The service was slow but not more than what I expected from before a game. We ordered beers and food and it did take a long time to get them, but we were in no hurry.   Sweet potato fries were a $2 upcharge with the sandwiches but totally worth it. And I got the regular fries and they were crispy and hot. Perfection.  For my lunch I ordered a Reuben. Reubens are my go to for most lunch time ventures. I love them and this one at the Souper Bowl was exceptional. The bread was toasted to perfection and the meat....it was piled on. I could not believe there was that much meat on the sandwich. I probably could have made an entire other sandwich from the meat. The sauerkraut was not overwhelming and had enough tang to get the mouth watering.  I enjoyed my time here and I look forward to coming here again!  Only question. The name...Souper Bowl. Is it a play on no one allowed to say Super Bowl? Because, they only had two soup choices! So it has to be that, right?"}
{"text":"Yeesh. Drop the pitchforks, guys...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gHKNwpny9o  Honestly, Souper Bowl ain't no dog...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UU62UcP_BA  I was on my way to a concert at the Consol Energy Center last week and realized something; In my excitement, I had forgotten to eat!   With concession prices making me want to avoid a pricey arena meal of cheesy nachos and hot dogs, I caught sight of an establishment I've sped by on numerous occasions. Enter: The Souper Bowl.   A chalkboard sign said \"WELCOME RUSH FANS!\"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49q59A8OhM8  And immediately I thought I was in the rec room of a relative, one with a loving obsession for Pittsburgh sports. Framed photos and logos ornamented the deep green walls. Surrounding me in rock t-shirts were Rush fans as young as 12 and as old as 60, all of them debating the merits of various Rush albums and songs, wondering aloud what the setlist would be like, revealing what they heard would be on the setlist and etcetera, electric progressive, etcetera.  Despite the lofty music I'd be hearing that night, the food was nothing showy. Burgers, hoagies, wings, and other such barfly fare make up the menu. Without putting much thought into it, I humbly requested the Carnivore Burger. With a medium rare ground chuck patty, a pile of equally succulent pulled pork, and a lollipop BBQ sauce that made the burger a glorious, very unRush-like mess no matter which angle I attacked it from...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdbd9oGDWd0  The french fries that came with it were intensely beer battered, crisp as autumn leaves, seasoned as a salt lick, and almost scalded my tongue, resulting in brief rage...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt1ZAJ_m-sg  My bad habit of digging into hot food before letting it cool notwithstanding...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_saheuIIjQ   ...I felt I had a pleasant experience here, food and friendly service included.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xNaqZcwQQ4  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sDLCvBk_YM  P.S. I damn near omitted the opening act: A small cup of sweet, softly spicy, ruby red chili that was loaded with starchy beans and hefty nuggets of ground beef. While my junior serving was ample, I relished the chili so that I secretly pined for...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn9tpqReYUY"}
{"text":"Whether you're a resident or tourist it's the goto place for an event at Consol. Tonight it's The Boss for us. This place gets packed when something is happening at Consol. Typical bar fare on the menu that hits the spot without costing an arm and a leg. Crowd varies depending on concert or hockey happening across the street. Nice staff. Decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Went here before a concert thinking it would be a good spot to get some bar food and a few drinks, I was sorely mistaken. I'm not sure who was waiting on the other reviewers, but I guess I got the one guy who forgot he had more than one table. I was given a plastic cup of water, then had to wait around 20 minutes to be asked if I wanted anything else. I was waiting on a friend, so I decided not to get food, bad move, I sat there for another 25-30 minutes without seeing my waiter again. I tried to flag down other servers to send my waiter to my table, but they all ignored me, so I left. I get that the place was packed, I expected that, but to be flat out ignored by multiple people when you arrived at the place BEFORE it filled up is pretty ridiculous. There was another table next to me that even mentioned they had been sitting there for a long time to the same waiter and he offered no apology or reasoning. Unless you like dark, cramped bars and being ignored for 30-40 minutes at a time, I'd strongly advise against going here."}
