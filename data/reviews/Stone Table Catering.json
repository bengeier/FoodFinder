{"text":"Stone Table catered a wedding rehearsal dinner for 30 people at the Henry Hall Wilson house in Monroe. Matthew and his staff were fantastic. Every dish was perfect. My favorite was the chicken with kale and ham. Peach cobbler was the best I've ever had. Highly recommended for any event."}
{"text":"One of the few caterers in Monroe and a damn good cook! You will NOT go wrong. Just cause we're little ole Monroe don't mean we can't throw a good party and Matthew is your man."}
{"text":"They have a restaurant in Monroe now at 109 S. Main St.  So you can enjoy the excellent food everyday! Great service.  Food was excellent.  I would recommend checking it out.  We had Stone Soup and Cauliflower soup and the Shrimp and Grits.  The even gave us some homemade chips as an extra.  And the coffee--- really great!  I would go there again anytime I was in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! They have really amazing Shrimp & Grits although not your typical bacon grits. These are really creamy with little bits of diced tomatoes. The chicken salad was pretty good as well with a good balance of flavor. However, I prefer my chicken salad with less mayo. VERY friendly service. The chefs seem to really care about the quality of the food they prepare. It's located in a nice little corner of The Shops at Nottingham; they have really made it charming given the space they have. If you're in the area, I recommend checking it out. Fast, fresh & friendly. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and nice atmosphere.

{"text":"I was intrigued by the reviews of this restaurant so my hubby and I decided to try it out yesterday evening. In case you don't know, they are only open one late night a week, which is Friday. I did call ahead to ask about specials and they offer lunch menu items along with the dinner offerings. I have to say, I was really in the mood for a concoction they serve---a pimento cheeseburger . I had one at a little tiny mom and pop place in Virgina last September and I was hooked. My husband , whose tastes really don't venture into the exotic or new wave , had the brined pork chop on quinoa. I can only say the meal was over the top fantastic and I never expected hubby to like the quinoa but he finished every bite! My hamburger?  I have half sitting in the fridge for today's lunch . It was huge and the tastiest burger I have had in years. It comes with home made fries which are to die for and, get this, home made ketchup. We had a delightful little blonde waitress who was most accommodating. When hubby got up to pay the bill, the chef cared enough to ask how we enjoyed the meal which is so thoughtful . You can tell they are truly sincere about pleasing your palate. The only complaint that I have is that the place is tiny so you really are kind of close to the other patrons but we had a nice conversation with a gentleman who said he eats there all the time and never is disappointed with the offerings. Next time , I plan to have the gnocchi . Loved this little gem of a restaurant and plan to go back for lunch very soon."}
{"text":"Matthew and his team catered our wedding on April 26.  The food was incredible and they all went above and beyond in making our reception a wonderful experience.  We got a comment from the proprietor of the venue the next morning that in his ten years managing that venue, it was the best food they had ever had served.  I highly recommend Stone Table for catering services and as soon as I have the opportunity to host another event, I'll be using them!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished dinner at Stone Table. Once again, outstanding food!! I had the shrimp & grits. It's made with stone ground grits w/ a lemon, Tabasco butter sauce. Out of this world good!! The wife had the crispy-skin, free range chicken, breast  & thigh, along with smashed potatoes, collard greens and pan sauce. Always a winner! The staff was very friendly and attentive. The service was a little faster than our last visit. Again, the chef came to our table on two different occasions to see how everything was. Can't wait for our next \"date night\"!"}
