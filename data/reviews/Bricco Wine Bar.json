{"text":"Went here for my husband's birthday because we wanted an above average dining experience.  Bricco was excellent.

Service was impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive, informed, articulate, and spoke poetry about the dishes.  He really believed in the product he was selling, which to me always speaks volumes in a restaurant.  He took the time to chat without being intrusive, and kept our glasses full and the table tidy.  It's really hard to find this kind of service in Canada: in my experience I've only had this level of service in fine restaurants in Europe and Argentina, where serving seems to be viewed as more of a profession rather than a part time job or something to do between careers.

Ambiance was gorgeous.  The large window in the front, combined with the airy interior and Danish modern decor create a perfect blend of natural light and modern style.  There's lots of space between the tables so you don't feel crowded in, and the lighting is just right.

FOOD: loved it.  I had the cod with scallops, and it was cooked beautifully with a slight smoky flavour.  Asparagus was tender and flavourful; sauce was rich but on a special night out, a little fat is OK.  We had polenta, salad, and potatoes on the side.  The polenta was delicious but quite heavy: you don't need to eat more than a spoonful.  No room for dessert though it was a temptation."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday.  I had heard some really good things, so decided to go see for myself - and my experience was amazing.  I've had gnocchi all over the place, and this was the best, most authentic I've ever had, bar none. 

Just as good as the food, was the service.  We were waited on hand and foot by Max, who was professional and polite, and answered all of our questions and met all of our requests with a smile.  The service was probably the best I've ever received at a restaurant.

The price was fair too - I've paid a lot more for mediocre food, so this was definitely a breath of fresh air.  I will definitely be back many times.  Love supporting a local business like this.

I would STRONGLY recommend this restaurant....as have most the other yelpers before me!

{"text":"Very trendy, Italian atmosphere. Staff was very welcoming, but restaurant seemed dead as a whole given it was a saturday evening. Extensive wine list with options for most wallets. We did not order food, as it was a bit overpriced, but menu appeared creative. We would like to come back for a celebratory occasion."}
{"text":"Bricco is a local Junction restaurant that I truly would like to support. ..but it confuses me. There is a meticulous attention to detail about restaurant decor. However in a couple of visits with friends,  one of four in the group wasn't happy with what they selected...while the other three were thrilled. Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?
I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine. I would have lost hope except the main was a cut of beef with an Italian pairing that was to die for!
Lets hope for more consistency and the locals will fill the room."}
{"text":"You will like this restaurant if you like a lot of noise. It was so loud that I had to shout to my husband across the table from me because everyone else was shouting. The set up in there seems to be for parties of 4 or more because our table was too big for 2 people there was great distance between us. Our reservation was 9 but didn't get a table until 930. With that said the food was ok, portions were small and overpriced. I wouldn't eat there again with my husband, it's not a romantic restaurant instead I would go with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food, phenomenal space and tremendous hospitality. 

I am not a wine person, although I enjoy drinking it. The staff at Bricco definitely knew what they are doing and got me to experience wine in a new way. The service was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. I'm not going to try and pretend to remember the names of everything we ate, but it was all delicious. If I had one quibble, I found the cod a tad under-seasoned. However, when things were running as well as they were just two weeks after opening, I can happily overlook that minor issue.

My friends and I will definitely be going back. Bricco is a great addition to the Junction neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food was OK.
Waited an hour to get a drink, the bar pretty much ignored us while we waited for our table  be ready."}
{"text":"Checked out this new place with freinds couples night out. Not bad looking spot for junction. Don't expect a huge place and too fancy.  We were disappointed there were not many choices on the menu for what we are use to in Italian dining.  Another surprise. Sides  were not included with your entree ended up costing everyone more and portions were small.  Many wine choices but hang on to your wallet.  Not sure we are going back."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. I almost don't want to review this place because I don't want anyone else to know about it. 

Try the scallops. 
Great furniture too!

Eric - keep up the good work. You're killing it."}
{"text":"This is place is wonderful. Great wine selection, staff always happy to make suggestions. We had scallops, lamb and gnocchi - wonderful. Great for a romantic evening:)"}
{"text":"I felt the need to update this old review.  Bricco still remains my favorite spot in the Junction. Just wanted to let you Yelpers know that the pasta thickness is perfect now.  I actually find myself dreaming about it!  Good thing it's walking distance for me and I can enjoy it whenever the mood strikes!  Eric has a magnificent spot that never fails to satisfy and impress."}
{"text":"I'm sure everyone in The Junction has been looking into these windows for awhile now wondering what this was going to be and when it is finally going to open.
Well worth the wait! I have been twice now. Each time it's been packed but we made reservations so we got a table. Wine was amazing. We got a bottle of the Spanish 2005 for $50 and it was such a great find. Food was delicious. Scallops were my favourite. We have tried the Chicken, Lamb and Cod so far. We saw the short rib come out and now I have to go back and have it.

I LOVE the ambience. High ceilings, brick walls and SPACE between tables. I had dessert once. The espresso cake. YUMMY!!!
Thank you BRICCO for bringing THE JUNCTION to a whole new level."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely amazing evening here.  The atmosphere was reminiscent of a wine bar in New York's Meat Packing District, which is to say uber-trendy.  We both tried one of each course and had a hard time deciding which dish we enjoyed the most.  I must say the braised lamb leg I had was absolutely amazing (narrowly beat out their cured meat & cheese starter plate) and my wife especially liked her grilled octopus appetizer.  As expected, their wine list was extensive and varied enough to support most budgets and tastes.  What made the night perfect was the staff...at every step each person we encountered truly helped enrich our experience and leave us wanting to come back.

I whole heartedly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"AWFUL! I planned my 30TH there because the ambiance and decor felt perfect for the type of evening I was going for and the look of the place/bulk of comments strongly suggested the food would be top quality. I made resos in advance, talked to the planner about a prix fix menu through email and over the phone and everything seemed like it was going well. Fast forward to the night- I was instantly disappointed and not one redeeming event proceeded. Firstly they didn't say HELLO to any of us- not a single acknowledgment and there were 2 people coming and going from the table, filling water etc. for a good 30 mins. After 30 minutes of us feeling like we were invisible, a girl took our drink orders. 20 minutes later we got them. 20 minutes later she started taking our app orders, 20-30 minutes later they arrive sporadically and many guests had to watch people eat while they waited. The apps were BLAND. Everything was BLAND! The rapini was crap, the potatoes sucked, the kale salad had a tsp of dressing. Never mind no passion in their cooking, there wasn't even an effort. The mains that arrived a while after were just as unimpressive, except one pasta dish (I'll give them that). We didn't get out of there until 3.5 hrs later and it wasn't because we were enjoying ourselves and conversing because we wanted the F out. It was because they didn't get any orders going until an hour+ into or arrival. By the time it was over everyone was bitter and our plan to visit a bar afterwards was out of the question. I was sooooooo bummed at the outcome of that bday and the thing that irked me the most was that they didn't greet ANY OF US. How do you not say hello? How do you shuffle around a group of people for 30 mins and act as though they're not there? I hate this place so much!"}
{"text":"Bricco is an excellent addition to the Junction.  The food is first-rate, the wine list excellent (at multiple price ranges) and the atmosphere is quite vibrant.   We tried to make a reservation via email (don't do it...they admit they don't always look...call ahead) so we couldn't get a table on a Friday night around 7.  But they had comfortable seats at the bar, and we had a great time. Service was first rate....our server made some very helpful suggestions and offered the services of a sommalier, if we'd asked.   We'll be back.  A bit pricier than most other places in the Junction, but less expensive than restaurants of similar quality and vibe downtown."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for a wonderful bday dinner last night.
This is a great new place in the Junction serving rustic italian that lets the flavours of the ingredients speak for themselves. Nothing is over sauced, spiced, salted, or peppered. Once you get your palate set, it is quite enjoyable.
The space is definitely well done. A tad sparse, but enjoyable.
Service was the best in The Junction. Not speedy, but done right. This is a place you should just relax and enjoy. 
We started with cocktails and the charcuterie tray, followed by sharing two appetizers, and then sharing a pasta followed by a main. I would eat the same way again as it allows you to have multiple flavours. 
Price was about right for quality food, wine, and service."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal at Bricco. Nice new addition to the Junction. Good service and comfortable space with lots of room. Food was well presented. Enjoyed the pastas and fish dish. We had the rapini which is an extra side. It was very good. Wine choices on offer were good and reasonably priced. Will return. 
Suggest they put a light in at the bottom of the stair leading to the washrooms. Saw a number of people slowly navigate the dark space."}
{"text":"Good was OK service was brutal.  We waited a long time to get our wine.  We order a red and a white bottle after pouring the wine they take the bottles away and never comeback to refill.  
I will not be going back mostly because of the service. 


Place looks awesome but really noisy so hard to carry on a conversation during dinner."}
{"text":"A stunning room - great mid-century furniture and perfect lighting. Server was attentive and very knowledgeable (especially with respect to the wine). We had an octopus appetizer that was lovely. It was the \"Gnocchi-licious Week\", so we tried 2 versions, one with rabbit, and the fried gnocchi. In both instances the pasta was super light and tender, however, some added salt (rabbit) and heat (fried) would've been preferable. That being said, I would definitely go back and try other items."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful. The food was okay, a bit on the saltier side. The food came pretty slowly and there were not enough staff working. I don't think the food or the experience is worth the price. Their plates used in serving food are really nice though..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but was disappointed and probably won't go back.

FOOD:
I had the boar sausage and he had the risotto.  We also had salads to start.  First off, the salads were hard to eat as the stems of the leaves had not been removed and they impeded the enjoyment of the starter.  Also, it was rather bland.  The main courses were over-salted.  My boar sausage was disappointingly lack-luster when it came to flavour.  The risotto was over-cooked, but other than the salt, it wasn't bad.

ATMOSPHERE:
Yes, this restaurant is pretty.

SERVICE:
They accommodated us even though we did not have a reservation.  It seemed like they just tucked us in and hoped the reserved party would come in late.  It worked perfectly for us as we finished up quickly.

VALUE:
Since we were disappointed with our meal, the restaurant was over-priced for what we experienced."}
{"text":"Food tasted good but my husband and I both got food poisoning (it was the only meal we had together).  That night after 30 min I was in the bathroom until midday the next day. It didn't affect him as bad tho, and good thing we have 2 bathrooms. 
For such an expensive meal, I would expect they'd take more care in food safety.
I went back the next day to let them know so they dont get more people sick but they didn't apologize (the same waiter was there) and just invited me back for another meal. Why would I want to go back again??"}
{"text":"Had the best gnocchi there ever (I requested red sauce, don't understand gnocchi and white sauce). Lovely decor and service. I personally feel it is a bit pricey and so I probably won't be heading there much."}
{"text":"Possibly the best wine bar I've been to in this city.
Great tight knit Ital-centric wine list with some interesting discoveries off the typical beaten bath of Italian wines, great for discovering, and a few quality local bottles were available as well.
The food is simply outstanding, some of the best Italian I've had in downtown Toronto, inventive, fresh, modern with a balanced definite old world feel and flavour.
Service is fantastic, Eric gives personal attention to everything and he's awesome guy to boot, and the other servers are always busy making you happy. 
Big open space with a great atmosphere, I always look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Cool space, mediocre food

Went for dinner on the weekend, space is large and nice. Was expecting some unique or genuine Italian food. Sadly it was just okay. Not terrible but nothing I would need to have again. Far far better Italian restaurants in the city at that price point and even in the junction. Service as bad too. Had that rush you to order feel. Made no effort to entice you to the specials. Just like \"here's the food we have, order whatever\""}
{"text":"The place was recommended to my boyfriend by a friend, our reservation was pretty late therefore is was fairly quiet but at no point did we feel rushed. The food was unbelievable, I had a pasta special with butter and shaved truffle. It was the best pasta dish I have had in a long time, maybe ever.

Highly recommend this place and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I've been here multiple times.   It's my go to for special occasions.     We always get the board : in house breaksticks, selection of meats and yummy  cheeses, homemade meatball,  liver pate etc.    Amazing way to start.    The gnocci are just like my nonna's...with the addition of truffles if your lucky.   Menu does change but there are always some variations of the items.   Gourmet Italian food.   I highly recommend it.   Plus the owner is absolutely fantastic.   All wait staff are kind courteous and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic Monday night dinner here.  The service was fantastic and the food was awesome.  One of the specials of the day was a ricotta ravioli which was like magic.  Literally, it was like a magic trick if it was food.  An egg yolk materializing in the centre of a very nice ricotta ravioli.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'll be back- said Dave while eating his meal...
This restaurant is a real gem. It is beautifully decorated with brick walls and wooden tables, chandeliers and carnations in ceramic mugs; all contributed to a very romantic setting.

I called at 8:30 on  Friday night and the manager took our reservation. We arrived at 9 and it was 75% at capacity with a few empty tables so I had a choice and took the table overlooking Dundas. 

Our waitress was Emma. She was very helpful and friendly. She explained the specials, one of which was a spring onion gnocchi. As I was craving gnocchi and my reason for picking this restaurant over the others was to try the braised rabbit gnocchi; I was torn now. She actually didn't help that situation as the way she described both made it all sounds amazing and said herself, its hard to choose. Little did I know, Dave was listening to us intently and at the last minute changes his order go braised rabbit gnocchi and so I can try the special! She's good! 

My spring onion gnocchi was delicious. It had a very mild hint of flavor similar to green onions. It was actually green. The sauce was creamy and cheese and mixed with mushrooms. I wish there was more mushrooms in the dish as it needed something to break up the creaminess of the dish. I couldn't finish it as it was so rich. But still very delicious!
I enjoyed Dave's gnocchi and I think I'll order that next time. The rabbit meat was very tender. The sauce had a sweetness to it and made the dish different from the usual standard gnocchi dishes. Both gnocchi dishes were delicious. The gnocchi itself was light, almost like biting into clouds. Not dense like others I've tried. 

I also tried a cocktail that I don't remember the name but it was made with a lemon/pepper gin, raspberry jam, soda (I think)... It was delicious! Perfect for a summer evening. 

All in all... I will be back. It was a last minute gem I stumbled upon for a quick dinner before heading out. 

PS- parking is free on Dundas after 6 pm. The area is quiet and far enough from the city core to avoid crowds and ample street parking available. There is also a green P about a block away."}
{"text":"I hate posting negative reviews but had a terrible experience here with friends. We found that the food was overpriced and not that interesting.  We also found the menu to be quite limiting.  It's a shame because the decor is lovely, good wines and it's in a great location. By far the worst part though is we had the most awful waiter who had a huge attitude problem, he was completely unwelcoming and very abrupt.  He didn't even make a pretense of being friendly and in fact it ruined the evening. He had the nerve when handing the debit/credit machine to us to actually comment that the prerequisite 18% gratuity for groups was the minimum!!  I believe that a tip is for good service and if I could have had the option for no tip I honestly would have. Worst service ever, would not recommend and will not be back."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. 

From the moment we walked in we felt right at home. 

Service was exceptional and the food rivals any other top Italian in the city.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bricco is a hidden gem in the Junction neighborhood. I have passed by there numerous times within the past year without noticing it. The exterior of the building appears very modest; making it easy to miss but it's actually very difficult to forget, once you have been there. Inside are beautiful brick walls and gorgeous chandeliers. They  carry unique, (difficult to find in Toronto) Italian wines. We started out with the white wine flights.  I ordered the Piedmont flight. Then we had seared scallops 4/5, the basil pasta 3.5/5, their pizza special 4/5 and their grilled octopus 6/5-the grilled octopus was stellar! Probably the BEST grilled octopus I've ever eaten! Our server was friendly and more importantly, consistent.  Overall experience: 4.5/5. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for her 52nd birthday. It was absolutely the perfect atmosphere, classy with a bit of character to keep things interesting. The service was great- just attentive enough. The menu is a on the more expensive side but totally worth it. Delicious food, and we got a bottle of (really good) wine for about 140$. If you have the cash and hadn't just had something to eat like me) I'd definitely recommend going full three courses though. It was also a little echo-y and loud because of a large group on the lower level so if you're looking for a quieter space, you should request the upper level."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day?  Party of 12?  They accommodated us, and we had four kids!

Not a thing to complain about here.  This is not your typical Toronto establishment.  They obviously care about the food and the wine (fabulous!!), but unlike so many other places they OBVIOUSLY care about their guests.  The reservation via phone, the greeting, the attention at the table, all 10/10 easily.  Not the cheesy attention, but classic, proper, refined, yet genuine, approachable and easy-going.  

I'm going back next week, alone, just to take it all in free of distraction!  Perfect marks."}
{"text":"Was exited to try this place - our group went here since everywhere else was an hour to an hour and a half wait.

The space was nice - seemed to be missing  a bit of warmth. Anyways, we were more here for food not decor.

Selection seems good - no real sell on anything from wait staff. Found out the special when we were making our order.

At most other Italian restaurants the first thing they bring you is bread and oil. It isn't even on the menu to order. 

So, obviously this review is heading in the wrong direction, and I wish I could say some good things. 

Glasses of wine or bottles only; no half or full carafe options. Sad, since again most trending Italian Resto offer this.

Apps were arugula salads and soup. Again back to bread. None served with soup - I mean what does it take for an Italian kitchen to make simple breadsticks.

On to mains - one person decided on the $30 gnocchi, only to be highly disappointed in mush. 
Three of us ordered the sea bass. It was OK., but again we compared to other experiences and this was a miss. The last person had the steak and was the again OK, lacked the love from the kitchen.

We didn't even look at dessert menu and were more interested in where we were going elsewhere for dessert.

sorry Bricco... we tried, but don't think you will see us again...."}
{"text":"Love this place!! We come here about 2-4 times a month since they opened and it NEVER disappoints. The food is always fresh and amazing. The chef changes the menu with the seasons, always enticing our taste buds. The service is always friendly, professional and exceptional. The owner is very knowledgable with wine as he is a sommelier and the wine list is great! We celebrate all our birthdays and events here as well. Love this place and I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"I love that this fine dining establishment is so close to me, and a perfect place to bring parents for a special occasion. They were very accomodating and the service was impeccable, but I can't say the same about the food. 

For apps, we got the trout crostini (yum), and the octopus (was good too).

It's Italian, but they have lots of options on the menu. I got the squid ink pasta, i expected the pasta to have squid ink as the sauce for some reason, but it was pasta made out of squid ink, with shrimp and clams. It was really bland. I never put salt in my food, but I had to. 

The Lamb Saddle was also a little bland too. But my parents loved the Sea Bream and their Pork. It seems hit and miss, and depends on what you order. 

I love the decor in the place, it was old school minimalistic classic, without being pretentious. I'd would give it another try one day."}
{"text":"Uniquely decorated with a decent selection of both red and white wine..  but the food leaves much to be desired.  

My second time visiting a wine bar as of recent i can even say that I truly enjoy tasting different types of red wine.  

The server was very attentive and even allowed me to try 2 of their best wines as per my request.  I got a chance to really choose what I liked.  

Now the pricing of food was not surprising but the fact that I ordered lamb swimming in a bland tomato sauce could be a little disappointing.  I couldn't even taste any lamb for that matter. I don't know how this is possible.  

Tried a bit of gnocci and it was ok but didn't appear to be handmade most likely outsourced and previously frozen.  

The cheese and deli tray for appetizers was alright to say the least.  It had an assortment of different flavours which could pair well with the wine.  That I wouldn't mind and would have preferred overall.  

I give 3 stars only for decor, customer service, and the wine of course.  Don't be mislead to thinking I will come back for the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We were back last night for the fourth or fifth time. Our only criticism is that it's too noisy. Every surface is hard and the sound just bounces everywhere. We couldn't hear the music, just the boom from all the voices.

I'm not sure what they can do about it and I'm sure we'll go back but I do think the noise level is an issue that needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Love that there are so many great spots in the neighbourhood. Our food was fantastic. However the service was downright awful. 4.5 hours for our meal, we had to beg for water, with 2 servers handling the entire restaurant. They had a full house...and reservations were hard to come by so they knew they'd have a full house. They need to get their service equation figured out. Not inexpensive, I had much higher expectations on the level of service."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place. Over 50 mins wait on entree and counting with no reassurance from staff. It's a Monday night with 6 tables. Hate to see it on a busy night. Can't rate the food since I might die before it comes. Expected more."}
{"text":"This place has great ambience ... however the food could be better. The fried calamari, shrimp and smelt was good and I would recommend that. But the mains were not as I was expecting.  The portions for the mains were small. Not that I'm a big eater ... but larger portion woukd be good. Over all though... it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"We had a very good dining experience here. 

The beautiful interior, larger than I expected, features large teak tables well-spaced which is a plus for me as I dislike being elbow to elbow with fellow diners.  

I actually had 2 different entrees because the first featured a tough, chewy bison steak.  The service, excellent throughout, handled this well, insisting on making me happy.  First they tried another cut of the bison, done a little more (odd, I thought, but who's to argue with a chef, and it was still only medium rare). When that turned out to be equally chewy they brought me lamb, which turned out to be very good.  The bison bits that were edible were fine too, btw, and I'm not sure who's at fault when it comes to a tough steak.  My partner in dine had a sea bream she loved, though I thought it wasn't so great.  A la carte extras are required unless all you want is that one item, though my date and I shared just one order each of potatoes and rapini as the sizes were large.  I guess I would call the food only adequate, considering the price which was about $35 per meal. 

As befits a wine bar, we found excellent by-the-glass selections to go with our respective meals.  

To sum up:  a great space, top-notch service, very good food and wine, though entrees were a little over-priced perhaps."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  The most horrible and overpriced meal I've ever had.  This is not real Italian cuisine.  Bland garbage. Luckily the potions were so small.  Wasn't much work to clean my plate. 

Spent $110 between 2 people and didn't even have any alcohol. 

The decor, lighting and atmosphere was really dark and depressing.  Jesus Christ, on top of it they sat us at a table with a window.  The view out the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Lol.

The waitstaff treated us like ghosts. 

Do not understand how anybody likes this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance and the best gnocchi dish I ever had. I'm a vegetarian and did not feel limited in my dish selections at all. Attentive but not annoying service. Plentiful wine list. Shared the antipasto board and the zucchini fritters were wonderful! I would come back for the gnocchi alone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's such a nice space with delicious food. They so wine flights at a reasonable price and also cheese boards/ charcuterie. Friendly and helpful service. Laid back dining experience with exceptional food. I've eaten here three times and each time was happily impressed."}
{"text":"OMG SOOOOO GOOD! One of the best restaurants I've eaten at in Toronto, or in the world for that matter. Everything tasted incredible. We ordered three appetizers and a side of polenta and two desserts and not one dish was less than spectacular. The grilled octopus was especially fantastic. I would come back here in a heartbeat. The wine flight was great too and good service, lovely atmosphere. Definitely a wonderful experience all around. Tiramisu and Chocolate Cake were stellar as well."}
{"text":"Briccio is a cute spot in the Junction for a date. In fact on the Monday night I was there the only other guests were couples (with the exception of one women having a drink at the bar).

Overall I'd recommend checking this place out although my rating is probably closer to 3.5 than 4 mainly due to the relatively pricy menu.

We shared the roast squash salad which was tasty if a bit small for the cost. The gnocchi main was excellent (definitely hand made) but again cost more than it should (was there really enough truffles to justify a $29 price?).

The risotto was very good as well and was priced more appropriately. The rapini was also good but nothing special.

Bricco has a fairly large wine list but the majority are only available by the bottle. Glass sizes are either 3, 5, or 7oz but 4 flights of three 2oz glasses are a cost effective option to sample some of the excellent wine. The Rosso Conero and Dogliani were our favourites of the 4 sampled.

The restaurant itself is charming with white painted brick walls. The interior is lit with low, soft lighting and the tables are spacious for 2 but still intimate. The restaurant is a bit on the chilly side and the washrooms are down a flight of stairs (with the bar area up a small flight).

Perhaps this isn't a perfect spot to regularly check out due to a touch high prices but worth it as a cute date spot on occasion when in the area."}
