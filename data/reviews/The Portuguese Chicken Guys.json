{"text":"Chicken was good but delivery took 2 hours.  They ran out of fries so they packed up  some Miss Vicky's in place of the fries.  Why wouldn't they call and inform me instead of charging me $5.50 for $2 worth of chips.  Not worth the wait in opinion."}
{"text":"I live in the area and work from home. I eat here 2-3 times a week. Obsessed with their chicken.. What is that hot sauce? Do not order the chicken without the hot sauce it is the best. I get the chicken sandwich (go for dark meat so much more flavorful). Or the plate with 1/4 chicken, potatoes and broccoli. Can not beat the price/portion/quality. YUM.   Plus, they've recently renovated. Eat in sitting at the bar at the window.   I wish they were open late!!! 9PM is so early. Would love to have this chicken when coming home after drinks... There are no good late night food options in the area."}
{"text":"The name and owners have changed. It is now called \"the Portuguese Chicken Guys\". While I'm not really a fan of the new name, the food and service have stayed consistent. The prices are great (you can get a whole cooked chicken for $10) and the BBQ Chicken is as good and as salty as ever. I don't really mess with any of the other things in the warming trays, it all looks kind of old. Stick with what's fresh."}
{"text":"Do not use these guys for any large catering requirements. We used these guys twice. Food arrived 45 mins late the first time. I was reassured that this would not happen again as they apparently under new management. Well I was wrong. This time the food arrived an HOUR LATE. This is completely unacceptable to have 150 people waiting for an hour to eat. We will never use them ever again! They didn't even try to compensate for their late arrival and they have been avoiding my phone calls. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I ordered the family combo and it's amazing! Well cooked and really tasty, it includes salad, rice, potatoes and a whole chicken just for 23 (taxes included). Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"1) The Brazilians here thought I was Portuguese, so I liked them off the bat.  2) We got a rotisserie chicken, a huge order of black beans, and salad for 19.99.  The chicken is especially good with their own mixture of hot sauce (although I'm sure the main ingredient is Frank's Red Hot).  They serve a lot of fried fish, too. It tastes like KFC, though- so I'd stick to the chicken. Ribs look good- but who knows how long they've been laying around."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about this place. If you're hungry, want something moderately healthy and don't care too much about taste, go here. If you want awesomely tasty food, don't go here.  Side note - if you get a side salad as part of a takeout order, ask them to not put it underneath your hot chicken. You'd think that would be obvious but apparently not."}
{"text":"This place has really improved. About a year ago the white meat was dry, but lately it's been moist. And I'm a dark meat guy, so it's hard to please me with white meat. I usually get a half chicken combo. I don't love their version of the little round potatoes (too mushy, I prefer a bit crispy) so I get the fries, which are really good, golden and crispy. The fact that you can get different sides aside from rice and potatoes is great too (salad, coleslaw, beans.) Portions are generous, and the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and great food. Called on a Sunday night just before closing time and was able to accommodate fast and hot delivery. Definitely a return customer. Exceptional value and proportions compared to the competition. Do it."}
{"text":"For the price this a great option in the down town Toronto area, it's clean and simple, the service is fast and courteous, and the food is fresh and healthy.  Not too much more you can ask for, hard to find a better bang for your buck either."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  I'm new to the area and come here often.  The chicken is very good but a little salty, doesn't stop me from picking up a whole bird or half chicken dinner two or three times a week.  The hot sauce is great, great portions for the sides (you can save some for later), and very quick service.  The only bad experience I've had is when I walked in to find out they were out of chicken but I won't hold it against them since it has happened only once."}
{"text":"Lured in by the sandwich pictures in the window, I couldn't resist. There were different sandwiches available including pulled pork and fish.  I ended up going for the chicken (chicken breast +$1.50). The sandwich was a good size, I took a bite and wrapped it up to take it into a movie. Yes, sometimes I'm that jerk eating delicious smelling things not purchased at the theater.  When I was seated, I upwrapped the sandwich. Instantly, the yummy chicken smell became hot sauce smell.  Tart and spicy, but not as delicious smelling as 10 minutes ago.  It's not a bad sandwich.  Heavy on the hot sauce, a bit dry, and bready. Overall, it was decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to grab one."}
{"text":"I had order some chicken to cater an event after having lots of difficulty. I filled out their form where they state they will respond to it ASAP with a quote. Well, approx two weeks later I resend the form and wait another two-three weeks. I finally decide to call them and make sure I order enough to qualify for free delivery... I was going to be so swamped the day of that I'd be very pressed for time to pick anything up. Well after I place my order I'm told that they do not deliver Sunday and that I'm out of their delivery area (Maybe have a map on the site showing where you deliver) then when I asked for a total I was told that said person didn't know & they'd get their boss call me that day once he got in. Strange but ok since I knew in my head what it would approx be. Well, to no surprise I didn't get a call and had to call back. The person I spoke to this time was on the ball and, funny enough, he knew the total right away - he read it off the bill. I sent my father to pick up the food & their debit machine wasn't working and wouldn't take visa so, because my father didn't have the whole amount (off by just a few $) they refused him the food. When he was going to walk out the later changed their tune.  When the food arrived the chicken was in huge chunks and I found it bland (with no seasoning on the side..which I was promised) but the potatoes and rice were quite yummy. Overall, not impressed at all with their customer service and the lack of flavour in the chicken. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I mainly come here for the rotisserie chicken, and I've been coming here since they had a different name but I found the quality of the food hasn't changed. The chicken is moist and the added sauce goes perfectly with it. Good to get the hot sauce on the side.    The rice and potatoes are also really good here. As I found other places sometimes don't get these right but this place is spot on.   They have good deals everyday for a different sandwich for $5 which is a pretty good deal as it's a pretty filling sandwich."}
{"text":"Solid. I wish they had some steamed vegetables or just another option besides rice and potatoes. It's really cheap and open later tho!"}
{"text":"This is a fine place to get some chicken. Whenever I go to a Portuguese place, I just get the half chicken with rice and potatoes. You can NEVER go wrong with this.   PCG's 1/2 chicken dinner was massive in portion. They pack the box with rice and potatoes. It's worth the $12 (after tax) I paid. The chicken is not the best I've had, but the sauce more than makes up for it. It's just spicy enough. For the 1/2 chicken, the breast piece didn't feel as moist as the thigh part. Probably because it's thicker. But it sure is a hell of a lot better than Swiss Chalet or those grocery store chickens.   They have other stuff too like ribs, Portuguese sausages, and daily $5 sandwich specials. However, the chicken is too good to pass up. I never seem to develop cravings for sandwiches but chicken? Hell yeah!"}
{"text":"In an area of town with many portuguese chicken joints, these are more like the back-up chicken guys. While their parisian potatoes were really good and more seasoned than most other places, the chicken was pretty underwhelming and not as meaty or even as moist as I'd prefer to see.  Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from these guys a few days ago and was really impressed. I have been getting Portuguese roast chicken on an almost-weekly basis for years from a popular place on Bloor. This was much, much better. The chicken was huge, and unbelievably juicy and delicious. It felt like a great value.  I also got a grilled sausage that was nice, but nothing to write home about, but nice as a side. I'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I found the place by accident and is great, great portions, good customer service and the food is delicious specially the sandwiches, now I'm a frequently customer."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up food for lunch.  The chicken with rice and potatoes is the way to go.  While the rotisserie is VERY soft, fall off the bone good chicken, those potatoes are the real special part of the meal.  The owner is very nice guy and was great at giving us a couple of suggestions on what to try that are his favorites.  The hot sauce is similar to Frank's red hot, its a little salty but still tasty.  The price is more than reasonable and it really is a nice little spot.  There are only a few small stools to eat-in, so definitely take your food to pick up."}
{"text":"My family stopped in for lunch today and had a delicious experience. All of the food we tasted was excellent and Eloy behind the counter was one of the friendliest people we met in Toronto.   I highly recommend the croquettes!   A perfect taste of Brazilian Portuguese food."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the Portuguese Chicken Guys.  I've been wanting to check it out for a while.  It's a small place (seems to do mostly take-out) and I ate in.  It was nice to sit by the window and watch the world go by ... but it was really hot with the sun beating in (they should get blinds or a better air conditioner).  I had a quarter chicken dinner (white meat) with potatoes and rice as my sides.  There was a huge portion of rice and potatoes and everything was delicious.  I had hot sauce added to my chicken and it had a nice kick.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I stand by the previous rating I gave their sandwich, however, I recently returned for the 1/4 chicken dinner.  The chicken was fine (the same as before), but the rice was really oily and flavorless and the potatoes seemed like they had just been boiled and they had no crispy exterior.  There was also a strange seasoning on the potatoes that I can't put my finger on.  I won't be back for either of these side dishes any time soon.  While most of the people who work here are really friendly, one of the girls who is here during the daytime is pretty rude."}
{"text":"We came to this area originally to try out a gourmet burger Resturant down the street.  But it was 230p on a Sunday, and they were closed until dinner time.  We then came across The Portuguese Chicken Guys and thought, \"what the heck?! Let's try it out\" And Wow it was awesome! The exterior of the Resturant weren't as pleasing to the eye, but once inside the aroma of fresh bird rotisseries would make any grown men hungry for chickens and lots of it!  We ordered the half chicken sandwich (to share).  They then took a fresh well seasoned whole chicken from the rotisseries and de-bone its meats.  Placed the chicken into, not too hard of a bun where most people would cut the top of their mouths, but a bun that is for most, bigger than your face :) The chicken was mixed with spring salad and mayo.  At first bite, we knew it hit the spot! The chicken is fresh and juicy. The bread weren't soggy and the greens were just right to have me tell any caring mothers in the world that I've ate my serving for the week ;)  ... This place is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"These guys are just plain awesome. They have been saving me from certain starvation for about 4 years, being members of the \"less-than-a-block (away)\" club. But it is about so much more than that.  Their rotisserie chicken is some of the juiciest I have ever tasted. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the ones that's been roasting for hours(? well, a long-ish time, anyway), tender and falling off the bone. The smell will likely pull you in from about three doors down, and Swiss Chalet will never taste quite as good again. Apparently they also sell seafood, and even (according to their business card) rabbit! But I am a creature of habit, so I must implore you to have a whole (but quartered) chicken, and sides of parisienne-style potatoes and rice. Every. Single. Time.   The super-friendly family who own the place are Brazilian, and proudly display their national pride in a wall-hung map and shelves of imported products. A particularly lovely result of this? Coke in a glass bottle, friends."}
{"text":"Really nice. Used to order from here all the time and then forgot about it until today.   We ordered the dinner for 4 through just eat. Rice, potatoes, salad, and a whole roast chicken. Delivery took under an hour and the food came to less then 30 bucks before tax delivery and tip.   The chicken was moist and pre cut which I appreciate  Potatoes oily buy in a really good yummy way. Salad and rice are solid. They say on the menu that these containers are small and they are anything but. Their \"small\" is a large anywhere else.   Pretty much order from here if you like simple food at a good price and want to have left overs for a few days. Top notch.   My only complaint is that they gave us the tiniest little container of hot sauce to accompany the \"family special\" so that's a little weird but it was tasty!"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN EVER!!! What a deal 1 Whole chicken, 1 salad, 1 rice and 1 potatoes for $23!!   Try to beat that Swiss Chalet!!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks clean and well taken care off. I've tried their chicken breast alone and leg chicken sandwich. The meat is well cooked and spiced and juicy. The sandwich bread tasted fresh and the service is prompt.  Hot sauce delicious !  My only complaint is the saltiness of the meat. In the times that I ate here I had the meat with a can of pop to help with passing the salt and than water after .  When it's too salty I doubt the quality of the meat. I hope that's not the case and that its just their way of cooking. There are like 5 chair for eating inside but mostly it's a take away place. I would rate highly weren't it for the salt issue which is really small if they take care of it."}
{"text":"The fish here is great (tasty and affordable fried fish) as is the bifanas sandwich. The potatoes are quite bland though (they're more like boiled with seasoning rather than roasted)."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the portions are huge and the chicken is amazing, other times things seem not so fresh and the portions are stingy.  The last time I ate there I ordered the chicken sandwich, which consisted of a stale bun and maybe a quarter of a quarter chicken portion. By volume there were more toppings than chicken.  They also have some Catholic Pro Life propaganda by the cash..."}
