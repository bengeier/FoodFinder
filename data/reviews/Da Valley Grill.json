{"text":"Lisa & Eric are the nicest people you will ever meet, their personal service and great food makes this place a must."}
{"text":"So authentic!! My wife is from Hawaii and the family who owns this restaurant are from Hawaii, too!! Food is so authentic and flavorful. My favorite is the GARLIC SHRIMP which is packed with flavor. The family is so friendly and their menu represents the islands so well!!! Menu offers a lot of options! My new favorite Hawaiian restaurant! The family is so nice and they have a lot of aloha!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Really good Hawaiian food and the people who work there are very friendly. I went there the other day for lunch with my family and I tried something that I would not usually have, the curry chicken cutlet with cheese, and let me tell you, it was amazing! I'll probably be going back soon just get more of that. Their other meals that I have had on other occasions such as chicken with special sauce and the mahi mahi plate are also very good. Da Valley Grill is the spot!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Excellent food. Huge selection. Thrifty prices. Good buy fer sure. Get the ninja bowl."}
{"text":"Awesome choices, great katsu, good prices! I wish I could eat here evey day! Curry chicken is good for the sniffles! I was lucky enough to live nearby for years and drive 6 miles to eat here, worth it!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times and saw the great Yelp reviews and figured I'd give it a try.  I had the kahlua pork and it was FANTASTIC!!  Perfect amount of smoke and super tender and juicy!  The owners are from Hawaii and are very nice.  It is located in a small plaza so if you blink, you'll miss it!  Whether you're in the area or not, you've got to give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"This was very good, kalua pork was smoky and a bit spicy, the spam musubi were big on the rice sprinkled with furikake and thin on the spam, but had good shoyu flavor sizzled in. Everything was very hot."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the parking lot at lunch time, but the food and service is worth it."}
{"text":"First time at this Hawaiian Asian fusion place. Wish I had been here more!  Menu has some really nice mix of Hawaiian and Asian selection (ie: loco Moco, kalbi short ribs, etc). I ordered #15 curry chicken cutlet with cheese. Mmmm that dish was fantastic. Cutlet was moist, skin was crispy and the curry cheese was very well flavored. Service was friendly and I definitely will need to revisit the other menu options."}
{"text":"They were out of the Kalua Pork, which is awesome so the owner suggested the Kalbi Short Ribs. OMG they are so tender and tasty! It is small slices of meat served with two scoops of rice and a side of macaroni or potato salad. The serving is plentiful and I'm having a hard time finishing but my taste buds won't let me stop. Highly recommend.  Aloha"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to meeting my girlfriends at DVG for lunch. There were ups and downs to my experience.  Up: Service was great. Even though you order from the counter, they bring the food and silverware out to you with a smile and check up on you. And they're quick!  Up: The veggie spring rolls. The order contains four spring rolls and it's $3.99. Despite the price tag, I would say the roll + sweet and sour sauce is worth it.  Up: They have Hawaiian juices and cookies for sale from the Kauai Cookie Co. - my friend was overjoyed to see the cookies, and I was very happy with my strawberry-guava juice.  Down: The only one, and a significant one. My teriyaki chicken was terrible. The mac salad was decent, but, and I hate to say this, Ono's is better. The chicken was drizzled with a tiny amount of sauce (but the sauce was tasty). The biggest problem was that the dark-meat chicken (I'm not a snob, I like dark meat), tasted like ham. It was like they sauteed the chicken with ham, or spam, and then picked out the pork and served the chicken. I've never been so repulsed - except the time I bit into a Milky Way thinking it was a Snickers.   I might go back to try their Kalbi short ribs, but the teriyaki ham experience will ensure that my next visit will be a long ways off."}
{"text":"Met the hubby for a work-day lunch break here, after another co-worker gave it great reviews. Their location may be difficult to find for someone who doesn't live/work in the area, but the food is worth the trip.   We shared the Kailua Pork (that everyone raves about) and the chicken stir-fry with rice, potato salad and cole slaw.  First of all, the owners were very nice and you could tell they truly care about what they do. They are recently transplanted from Hawaii, so their perspective, I believe, is authentic!   Both dishes were amazing, generously portioned and perfectly priced for lunch. The pork is beyond-tender. I especially loved the sauce for the stir-fry chicken (I believe they use the same sauce for beef, tofu, veggies, etc.). It has a little kick to it and lots of flavor which I love. All and all, both dishes were great and we even had enough for a small leftover meal.  I didn't notice the bento box sampler until after I'd ordered and I think I'll try that next time--a little of each of the sides and your choice of a sampler of proteins. Perfect for me!  All and all, great food, friendly owners (and this beats the pants off that L&L  Hawaiian place off Happy Valley), and good prices."}
{"text":"Picked up the lemongrass chicken with mac salad the other day and was super impressed. The chicken was so unique--sweet, lemony, spicy (you choose your level of spiciness) all at once. I really appreciated that they achieved the flavor without battering and frying. This place is DEFINITELY a better alternative to chains like Panda. The rice was perfectly cooked, which is really important for me, and having two sides between the rice and mac salad was awesome because the portion of chicken was HUGE. I split the dish between lunch and dinner and was full both times. Will be returning and recommending to friends."}
{"text":".I took a photo after meal for a change and to let everyone know that their food served are tasty, delicious & fresh, I barely eat or finish my food if it's not good.So, I posted an almost clean plate.  Price is reasonable and owner is so accommodating and friendly :-) I will be back to try their other menu."}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  It was cooked properly just not real tasty.  The portion size is good and the service was solid."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and I can tell you the whole family was extremely impressed, even our picky 9 yr old. I had the large Ninja bowl and it was delicious (and huge. Next time I'll get the small). Rice was perfect and chicken was tender. Sauce was what a was hoping for...savory with a little sweet. My husband got the LocoMoco with a side of macaroni salad. The sauce wasn't what we were expecting but was even better. Loved the Mac salad also. My son had the Katsu chicken and he described the sauce as A1 plus pineapple. Doesn't sound appealing but it was yummy. Lastly we had the Pineapple Chicken Nuggets. Believe me when I say this dish is eloquent enough for adults.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Just ate there. Fantastic food and great price. They weren't busy at all for dinner and I talked to one of the owners. She said they are usually really busy for lunch but dinners are starting to pick up.   The place is off the side of Deer Valley Road and it is in kind of a strip mall. You probably wouldn't even notice it as you pass buy except for the neon lettering ads on the side facing the road.   The place was really clean and simply furnished. The owners are really hospitable and can really help you pick out what you want.   If you are looking for that Hawaiian Islands/ Asian fusion food this a real find. My wife and I bought several entrees that included the lemongrass chicken, the Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken. We also bough spring rolls and Spam Musibi.   The lemongrass was delicious, it had a little spice and you could really taste the lemongrass. The Kalua pork was definitely for meat eaters, smoky and soft a better version of pulled pork. The teriyaki was also delicious. All the entrees came with heaps of white rice and choice of sides. We chose Cole slaw and Macaroni salad. All of them were super good and fresh.   The spring rolls were smaller, 4 per order, but really very nice. The Spam Musubi was great and was a freshly fried piece of spam on rice wrapped with seaweed.   All of it made us feel like we were back in Maui and you can't beat the prices. Highly recommend this place if you need a real Pacific Island fix on a short budget but want real flavor."}
{"text":"Very well prepared Hawaiian cuisine.  Completely blows L&L out of the water. I definitely recommend the Kahuku shrimp."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I'm always excited to find food inspired by the islands. We have visited Da Valley Grill three times now, and we have enjoyed each time. The location is a little hard to find. If you weren't looking for it, you would never know it existed as it's located in an industrial-looking business center. We drove past it the first time we went.   On our first visit, the hubby ordered my all-time favorite plate lunch, Chicken Katsu. It was lightly pan-fried and was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was a little different that I have been used to, as it's a little on the sweeter side. I'm used to a more smoky favor, but it was still tasty. So we could try another item on the menu, I ordered the Kalua Pig. It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and not too salty. The plates are served with two scoops of rice and one side (macaroni salad, potato salad, or coleslaw). On the second visit, the hubby again went with the Chicken Katsu, while I ordered their Kahuku Shrimp (mostly because my dad is a Kahuku High School alum, lol). The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice, spicy kick to it. On our most recent visit, I couldn't pass up the Chicken Katsu yet again, so we both ordered it this time.   While the restaurant is small, it is clean and has plenty of seating. Service has been friendly and consistent. I wish their saimin was served all day, rather than just during breakfast (7-10am weekdays, none on Saturday) as it is one of the foods I miss most from the islands."}
{"text":"Mahalo Daren C. For the awesome recommendation! Without you I would have never found this killer spot. And yes, I was sure to mention your name to the lovely owners. ;)  The food was fresh & ONO. The service was personable, interior was clean and the prices were decent. Every single bite of my garlic shrimp, egg rolls, shrimp katsu & chocolate mousse pie was worth the 24 mile drive over (in traffic too). I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Location: Just like the other reviews say, this is a Hawaiian Asian fusion restaurant. The place is located in a crappy strip mall area, and can be easy to miss. I have been there several times, and seem to accidentally drive right by it.   Service: Good service. This is a small family-owned restaurant with quick turnaround, from order to food. The lady who owns the place, Lisa, runs the register and makes suggestions on things to purchase.   Food:  I always consider price v. food quality. For a meal with, it will run you about $7-$9. The portions are decent, and I've never found myself to be hungry after eating. Meals involving shrimp about $10. As the food is decent, you get large enough portions, and the price is good, i would definitely say this place is worth a stop. If you are expecting gourmet cuisine, don't come here, but if you want good quality Asian food that works, please come here."}
{"text":"I tried the Teriyaki Chicken and it was AMAZING! Served with a side of rice and mac salad (which was like no other macaroni salad i've had before), this was a very satisfying meal! I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone! And the chef was the sweetest lady, very friendly restaurant!"}
{"text":"Small Hawaiian food spot in a strip mall.  The Kailua Pork was good.  Flavorful,  Good sized portions. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined at Da Valley Grill after passing it many times over the last several months, we decided to give it a try. From the outside we were expecting the food to be like that of a shopping mall food court. We were happy to find out that wasn't the case. They have a nice touch with a chalk board menu along with many pictures of the dishes along with Hawaiian music in the background. We were warmly greeted upon arrival, asked if we had been there before, had any questions... The family run business is quite pleasant.  There were many menu choices to cater to anyone's needs from various meats to vegetarian and tofu. We finally decided on their current special which was a spicy chicken dish and a teriyaki chicken dish. They both come with two scoops of rice and a choice of either coleslaw, macaroni or potato salads. Our orders were brought to us in probably 5 minutes. The appearance and taste can be summed up easily, fresh. Everything was delicious and quite a value. We will definitely be returning and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Its so ONO. The portions are large, prices small and its very tasty. Its hard for me to go to a Hawaiian style joint and not try the kalua pork. Its got its own unique taste here, smoky and a little peppery. Well executed. Very nice people and pleasant inside. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Got the pineapple chicken meal!!! Mmmm it was delicious! First time here. Very nice, clean family owned business!"}
{"text":"They have Hawaiian Sun! Various flavors and cold! They have cookies! The Ninja bowl is teriyaki chicken, but thigh meat.  I prefer white meat! I asked for veggies instead of rice, most places you get the mixed vegies, I got shredded cabbage and a few pieces of broccoli. I didn't eat it all!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem: Simple clean (out dated) dining area. Service: Very Nice employees and good service. Food: Cooked just right, flavorful and more than I could eat.  Great hidden gem to share with friends and clients!"}
{"text":"Small family owned feeling when walking in. Super friendly service that has some information on the ethnic food. Get your Asian fix that's more authentic than regular Chinese food. The theme is Hawaiian Asian cuisines"}
{"text":"I've only been once, it was good.  I had the BBQ chicken, comes with 2 scoops of rice and I chose the potato salad.  It was good, but not fabulous.  I'll definitely go back and try the ninja bowl everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Hawaiian places to go. It's kind of like Japanese Hawaiian fusion, it's small and cozy. The owner is the lady who will be taking your order. They're fast and the food is quality. The portions are a little small, but that just makes it easy to finish your meal, and trust me, you will."}
{"text":"First time here and man, this food was delicious. The lady running it was super friendly and answered all of our questions."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch. Try the Thai fish. The Chicken Katsu was crazy good also."}
{"text":"I just picked up my food about 20 minutes ago and it's so good I had to leave a review now. I've had the chicken katsu from here before, and while it was good, the curry chicken with cheese is out of this world good. I could probably eat it for the rest of my life and I'm mad I've been missing out on it for so long. Service was friendly, food took about ~8 minutes to be prepared so there was a little wait but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Incredible! There is a reason this grill stays busy...good peopleand good food...and generous hearts....gave to a worthy cause!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, always enjoyed my katsu curry or teriyaki chicken! Friendly service and authentic Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"You know a Hawaiian place is authentic when their Spam Musubi has more flavor than just the salt from the spam.  What a great local and family business that takes pride in their Hawaiian roots.  The family lived in Honolulu and opened their store about 6 months ago.  Besides the location and limited hours open, this place has delicious Hawaiian food that truly reminds me of the islands.  Kalua pork is very tender and juicy.  The flavor is all there when you take your first bite, and it keeps coming when you chew and swallow it down!  The sides of potato salad, rice, and cole slaw are tasty compliments to your main entrée.  I know all you local Hawaiians or Asians are asking about the mac salad?  The owner told me they will soon be selling it.  There perspective was most people may not like the mac, so they went safe with the potato.  Although once the mac salad comes, be sure to get excited.  The price is right, the interior feels like the Islands, but the location and hours are rough.  They definitely are a lunch place, and only wish they were opened a little later.  However, what a great place to enjoy authentic Hawaiian food.  My only question is, when is the poke coming?  We will see you again, Da Valley!"}
{"text":"4.1 out of 5. My wife is from Honolulu so we are always looking for something comparable in the valley. The owners are very nice, the food was fresh and very tasty. My wife got the Garlic Shrimp and it was excellent. The only knock is for the price you don't get a lot of food, better quality than an L&L but you will probably still be hungry and spend more."}
{"text":"The Thai Curry Tofu (I am vegetarian, my wife says chicken is just as good) is so good...especially the sauce!  I get a craving about once a week and we usually give in at least once a month.   The owners are so friendly.  We are grateful to have delicious Hawaiian Fusion so close to home!"}
{"text":"Really good. Had garlic shrimp and chicken katsu. We really liked it. Haven't eaten much Hawaiian food before but I will now."}
{"text":"Visiting for a class in the area and have found a great place for lunch. Super friendly staff, really clean, and good food. Easy to miss, but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a change of pace from the norm!  Small and family run its a hidden Deer Valley Gem.  We ordered the loco moco & the Curry Chix - Both were very good. Loco Moco is one of my favorite Hawaiian hangover dishes (basically hamburger patty, rice, brown gravy and sometimes fried egg and green onions) and this version was great! I like mine a little more on the spicy side and they took care of me. The Curry chicken had plenty of heat, moist and yummy!  Overall a fantastic local place to try!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many 5 stars reviews we decided to give this a try. If you've read my other reviews, Leo's at Arrowhead is the best Hawaiian in Phoenix (so far). We ordered beef Kalbi short ribs, Teriyaki beef and chicken. First up the Kalbi weren't short ribs but cut up beef, nothing like Korean short ribs I'm used to. The teriyaki beef and chicken were just ok. RIce and macaroni salad were also not as good as Leo's."}
{"text":"Chicken katsu was great, however, loco moco not so much. Staff was very friendly. Will go back."}
{"text":"Brought a big party from work because I had been once before and had decent katsu. Ended up being really embarrassing for me. Among the six or seven dishes, we had food that was soggy, burnt, cold, room temperature, dry, old, sour, unseasoned...just the most dreadful assortment of food I had ever seen. Absolutely shockingly bad. The pork needed a health inspection. It might have been in the slow cooker for several days. I'm not joking. We threw all da kine in da rubbish bin. Not ono."}
{"text":"Small location located in plaza that's easy to miss. Definitely a mom/pa restaurant. Owners were very nice. Lots to pick from the menu. They have speciality drinks, such as iced Thai tea, Vietnamese iced coffee, and fresh coconut. I only go to try the spam musubi. $2.50 each. They were good and still warm when I got home. I would give this place a try. Support small businesses. I will have to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here so tried the Chicken Sautee w/special sauce, white rice and cole slaw. It was pretty good. Nice size portion for $6.95"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and friendly staff. The restaurant was clean and welcoming. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very traditional Asian - Hawaiian cuisine. Lisa is always very nice and makes it a nice visit.  We recommend the kalbi short ribs and chicken katsu."}
{"text":"This place always blows my mind. Such a nice mom and pap family with great food. Quick service and more than reasonable. Recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Phoenix and looking for a quick, but still sit in restaurant. Oh my goodness, this place was wonderful. The staff was so nice and the food was amazing. The Thai curry chicken special was wonderful. It was as such a pleasant experience, I couldn't recommend it more."}
{"text":"I've always considered commercial Hawaiian-style cuisine as fun food - a bit unusual, fun to order and generally quite tasty. The food here is no exception. The spam musubi was quite flavorful and appealing, but there's a bit of bias on my part as I am a fan of spam. For the main course I ordered the Kahuku style garlic shrimp; it was delicious and had a really pronounced garlic flavor, just the way I like garlic-sauced dishes. It was served on top of sticky rice which was a bit too sticky for my taste. Perhaps this batch of rice was boiled in a bit too much water; that was the damper to the meal and I left most of the rice on the plate. But I finished every bit of the shrimp and the very flavorful sauce. The restaurant itself is clean and simply decorated with Hawaiian surf stuff and the service was efficient though very businesslike."}
{"text":"The location is easy to miss, but the food is surprisingly good... Hawaiian-style Asian fusion.  I had the curry chicken with cheese, a side of macaroni salad and spring roles.  The food was very well executed."}
{"text":"Yelp does it again! Me and the P were looking for a new spot and located this one on Yelp during a Saturday holiday shopping day.  I'm not the biggest fan of Hawaiian BBQ but this was unbelievable.  Had the Kahlua pork with two scoops of rice, outstanding coleslaw, and a very generous portion of meat.  It was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to go back. The P had the same only with potato salad which was equally tasty, homemade, and great flavors.  The staff was outstanding, very pleasant and made us feel at home.  Place is spotless and adequately priced, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite Hawaiian grill.  We love this place and will always be a frequent visitor.  Please give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place just opened and is amazing. The owners are super friendly, the portions are very generous and the prices are great. The Kaluah Pork was the family favorite for us! It was wonderfully seasoned and very tender. We will definitely be visiting there again. We had a great lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Now I am no expert in Hawaiian food, but my brother is pretty close to one and he really loved this place. And I have to say I thought pretty highly of it myself. Don't expect any glitz and glam. This is a mom and pop kind of restaurant. Simple. But I have no problem with that. It kind of feels like you are going to one of your friends parents houses and having dinner or in our case lunch.   So like I said, my brother is a pretty big fan of Hawaiian Cuisine. When I stumbled across this place on yelp I knew I had to bring him. And let me tell you, when my 15 year old brother asked the lady taking our order if they had Spam Musubi, she about fell over. \"Uh.. we do.. How do you know what that is?\" As that is something not typically on their regular menu. I knew we were in the right place. I am usually not a fan of Spam (Tehe.) But this was surprisingly tasty. Charred Spam, Sticky rice, wrapped in seaweed, drizzled with a sweet and salty sauce. They had a meal where you were able to chose 3 meats and 2 sides. I tried the Fried Mahi, Chicken Katsu, and the Pineapple chicken with the sides of White rice and macaroni salad. Everything was tasty but my favorites were for sure the Fried Mahi and the Macaroni salad.   I think this will become a regular stop for my brother and I on our brother, sister day dates."}
{"text":"The food came out super fast. Ordered the shrimp. It was tasty. Idk if I would give them 5 stars (exceptional) but I was very pleased and would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Revisit today. Arrived at 11:40 on a Tuesday and two guys were dining. More came later.   I ordered a Bento Box with Chicken Katsu, Kailua Pork and Pineapple Chicken. I added a can of soda for $9.47 plus tip. The Bento comes with rice and a side, so I chose macaroni salad this time.   My lunch arrived in about 6 mins. The Kailua Pork was hot to the point of steamy. The Chickens were good, each with its own dipping sauce.   There was plenty of food to fill up this big guy and I still couldn't finish it.  The chicken was virtually the same for both dishes, just different sauces. The pineapple sauce was so cold and sweet, it went ignored.   Still the best Katsu around!"}
{"text":"First the food is taste bad and it kinda overpriced for small portions and guess what they sale me a expired soda can . Unbelievable!!! Do not go here ! Go to the L&L Hawaii BBQ in happy valley way better than this location"}
{"text":"Great Kalua pork and Mac salad. My friend had the lemongrass chicken and said it was awesome. Very good price for excellent food. Mahalo."}
{"text":"The food choices here are great. I tried the teriyaki chicken bowl and you can tell the quality of food it had. I came back a week later and had the Ninja Bowl that I was waiting to try. I wasn't disappointed at all and it was better than I thought. I had it with bacon on top and the combination is fabulous.   Friendly staff and a must place to eat at if you want different from the same boring stuff. Favorite small place to eat here in Phoenix as I just moved here.   Peace :)"}
{"text":"This place has really good food. Owner is super kind and friendly, as well as staff I met.  You get lots of good flavor with entrees. lol I short ribs are fed worth coming back for!  Didn't like the smoothies though. I don't think there was any real fruit or even fruit juice in it at all. It's rather hidden away, but worth it when you get here!"}
{"text":"Hungry for Asian food, found this on Yelp. Reviews looked great, so we gave it a try. WOW!!! Very impressed!!! Hubby ordered the Chicken Curry - yellow (hottest), I ordered #3 Shrimp, and we split the Spam Musubi. I must confess - I LOVE SPAM!!! This did NOT disappoint- it was wonderfully crisp, sitting on top of a rice block, all wrapped in seaweed with an amazing sweet/spicy sauce drizzled on it. Great way to begin!!  Then our meals arrived, piping hot, with intoxicating aromas. My #3 Shrimp was tossed in a spicy red, yummy sauce, served over rice, garnished with green onion. I was in heaven!!!  Hubby's Chicken Curry was scrumpdillyicous!!! Great heat level with the sweetness of coconut milk to balance it!   My meal had the choice of a small salad, so I chose the macaroni cuz it was \"Hawaiian\" style. Never had it that way, so why not, right? It was delightful! No mayonnaise, just oil with some spices- I loved it!!  Great experience, very helpful staff, the place was super clean, nothing fancy, but you felt comfortable.  We will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Craving local flavor? Quick satisfying and tasty. Chicken Katsu was tender and crispy, Garlic Shrimp loaded with flavor, and Teri Chicken's large portion was filling.  Will definitely visit this spot again. Aloha!"}
{"text":"The best Hawaiian restaurant in the north phx area! I always order their chicken katsu and spam musubi (togo for later).  My aunt tries something different everytime we go and she hasnt been dissappointed with any dish.  This place is small, its clean, family owed and they are all very nice!"}
{"text":"I was checking on Yelp to see what restaurants were in North Phoenix that I haven't yet tried and Da Valley Grill came up. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted. I noticed they have a chalk board menu and under the breakfast items was Saimin to my delight *^_^* . Unfortunately breakfast time had already passed so I'll have to come here again to try that out. From past Yelp pics of the menu, they do change their menu from time to time since I saw bento option that wasn't available when I came that day. Which I actually like since it means I can try new things they have to offer.   So from  all the savory choices on their menu they had that day, I opted  to order the Kalua Pork and their Spam Musubi. The pork was tender and super moist. I think it needed just a tad more seasoning, but overall I enjoyed it. The Spam Musubi was just as I expected it, no rant or rave.  I also had a bit of Chicken Katsu my friend ordered. That was actually pretty good with just the right amount of breading and lightly fried and to top it off it came as 2 generous cutlets. Couple notes, if you're trying to find the place for the very first time, you might miss it as I did. The restaurant is sort of in the industrial section of that area. Also they close at 4pm during the week and are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place was great. I enjoy the Hawaiian food. They had lots of unique choices and makes me want to return."}
{"text":"Awesome place... everything on the menu is delicious. the Thai curry chicken is Da bomb!!! You can tell everything is made with love. The service is outstanding and very personable, always a smile and a kind word... would go there every day if I could. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great Kailua pork. Garlic shrimp was just like I had in Hawaii. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not even done with my plate and here to write a review of how awesome this place is!!! Never on this side of town but I was hungry for some Asian food. The spicy garlic shrimp was on point! Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. Lisa is a great cook with an amazing personality. The menu is great I love the short ribs. The restaurant is always clean and tables available."}
{"text":"This place is really great. The owners seem to be very nice, the restaurant is clean and simple, and the food is great. Recently they started making Hawaiian inspired Boba drinks. The food is always of great quality and if you are looking for something great and quick for lunch or dinner, look no further."}
{"text":"Most of the food we tried seemed very old and leftover. All the food we were served was just luke warm and almost cold when it arrived. They never even bothered to unwrap the Musubi from it's plastic wrap. The food reminded me of food from the worst budget buffet I ever went to.   I tried a Bento Zip Box with Pineapple Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken and Mahi Mahi with Potato salad. Both Fried Entrees (Pineapple Chicken and Mahi Mahi ) were almost cold and when I bit into them Oil squished out and left a bad after taste in my mouth. I found both fried entrees inedible. The Teriyaki Chicken was cooked nice but was also almost cold with a not to offensive bottled cold sauce squirted on. It didn't taste so fresh but was the most edible thing on my plate. My white rice seemed over cooked and mushy and also didn't taste fresh. I kept eating the potato salad trying to figure out what was wrong with it and my conclusion is no salt or pepper was used in it. I liked that they used fresh green onions in it but I think maybe the potatoes might have been old because it really didn't taste good.  Unfortunately my husband had a similar experience with his plate that was all different from mine. He had a Spam Musubi that still had plastic wrap on it. He couldn't eat the Kalua Pork it did have some fresh green onions on it but other than that it lacked flavor and seemed unseasoned and was almost cold. The most edible part of his plate was the Katsu Chicken it seemed like it was made today but was also almost cold. The rice was overcooked, mushy and not so fresh tasting. The Macaroni Salad seemed like it was a month old. The Mayo had broken down to just paste like oil and was very offensive and horrible.  Approximately. 2/3rds inedible food.  Approximately 1/3 edible but not so great almost cold food.  Equals One star I will not return or recommend.  My stomach was turning for hours I thought I'd be sick. It was like catching Da Valley Fever from Da food. 5-14-14 I appreciate that the Da Valley Grill contacted me about my exsperience. I am certain this might have been fluke exsperience since they didn't have their regular cook on. But the honest truth is if the food wasn't old it was very mishandled or equipment wasn't working right. I do appreciate their concern and are very glad they are looking in to what happened. I was hoping this would be a new favorite since I am found of another Hawaiian Eatery in the Valley and this place offers different options. I do hope they figured out what happened and I hope this was just an isolated  circumstance."}
{"text":"Great little gem that I didn't know about.  Place is clean and the very nice couple that operate it are very humble and hard working.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Friendly Service  A co-worker and I dined at Da Valley Grill after reading so many pisitive reviews. Da Valley Grill is easy to miss in the middle of all the car shops but just look for the brightly colored sign. From the outside we were expecting the food to be similar to that of a shopping mall food court. We were happy to find out that wasn't the case.  We were greeted upon arrival, asked if we had been there before, and if we  had any questions. Da Valley Grill is a family run business is quite pleasant.  On this visit we ordered the Chicken Katsu and Teriyaki Chicken. The chicken was cooked to order and served freseh and hot. Both entrees were served with two scoops of rice and a choice of either coleslaw, macaroni or potato salads.   Our orders were brought to our table within 5 minutes.  The appearance and taste can be summed up easily, fresh.  Everything was tasty and the prices are wallet friendly.    If your ever in the area, you should give Da Valley Grill a try."}
{"text":"I work in the 85024 zip code and there isn't much to eat around here besides chain restaurants.  Not much besides Da Valley Grill, which has become a weekly lunch place for me.  All of the food here is excellent and, unlike some of the aforementioned chain restaurants, the food here is fresh and (probably) a lot healthier.  And while some of the other reviewers mention the kalua pork, I always order #1 - the chicken sauté with special sauce.  It is spicy and delicious.  Prices are reasonable and lunch has always been under $10."}
{"text":"I stopped in around 1:30 today, and placed my order with the friendly lady at the counter.  I asked for the bento, which is not listed on the menu (thanks Yelp.) I ordered the Kahlua pork, chicken katsu, and teriyaki chicken with macaroni.  I also ordered a spam musubi on the side.  The food took about 5 minutes. And it was cooked fresh.  The musubi came out hot and wrapped to keep it moist.  It was the winner of the meal.  The rest I could do without.    The teriyaki was akin to what you would at the mall. And the Kahlua pork was sitting in a boat of grease. I wanted to drive back to get more musubi, because the rest of the items were not to my liking. However, the spam musubi, was the best I ever had. The next time I go back, I'll order a few of them as my meal."}
{"text":"I was referee here by some friends that were working on my car came in in and I got a teraki chicken over white rice. Large filling portions  Perfectly cooked rice Great customer service And juicy chicken  Don't mind breaking my car again if it ment coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the firs time.The best teriyaki chicken I've ever had! it had so much flavor and wasn't sweet like all other teriyaki I've had. I'll be going back to try other dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small family-run restaurant located in a strip mall with predominantly auto repair businesses. Inside you'll find 10 tables. Modestly decorated with Hawaiian paraphernalia. TV in corner usually playing sitcoms. Has a very low key family- run vibe.  Food: Over 20 Hawaiian inspired Asian dishes on the menu. While I'm no expert in Hawaiian food I feel like the menu is closer on the spectrum of straight up Hawaiian food as opposed to Asian food.  My wife had the short rib and I went with the garlic shrimp. Both were excellent! The garlic shrimp sauce was amazingly flavorful. For beverages they offer Boba and Hawaiian Sun cans. Food was served on porcelain plates that you might have in your own kitchen, which adds the comfy vibe.  Service/price: Was very well taken care. Price might be considered high for Asian but appropriate for the uniqueness of their food.  Overall: A great family run place to patronize!"}
{"text":"I was invited to the Grand Pre opening the other day and holy PORK.   The Kahlua pork was smokey, tender and juicy. (they leave some fat on it to ensure the juicy had that and a scoop of white rice and potato salad.   The rice was nice and light not too fluffy or too clumpy!  The tater salad was great, they add a little cilantro and man does it work!  I cannot wait to try some other dishes.   They still serve the donut in the AM. Rainbow Donuts are 10x better then Dunkin!  AND They still serve some of Bobby C's dishes like, Fried Bologna, green chili burritos and Ninja bowls.   Come stop by and tell em Daren Suggested it...maybe you'll get a free donut?"}
{"text":"Ate here many times for lunch when working in the area. Food is tasty with many things to choose from. Service is great. I would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Great menu, best Hawaiian in Phoenix!  Had the combo with pineapple chicken, chicken katsu and the kalua pork.  Super flavorful.  Potato salad was tasty too.  Will go again!  Soon!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood Hawaiian grill and Asian fusion; something we needed on the north side of Phoenix.   I came here after checking out Yelp and wanted to try something different.  This is definitely your mom/pop restaurant located in the heart of an industrial area.  I gather lunch time is when it's time to hit up this spot.  The decor are very basic and to the point; matter fact I would say lack of decors!  My first time around I shot for the Kalbi beef with rice from a recommendation by the register boy.  Overall, I didn't really care for it.  The beef was half tender and half chewy.  The sauce and coleslaw that came along with it was a nice compliment.    The second time I came around I shot for something I wanted; the Ninja Bowl with Bacon!  I thought it was a pretty solid Ninja Bowl; nice fluffy soft white rice at the bottom topped with strips of chicken and a sweet sauce.  The bacon was nice and crunchy giving this dish an array of texture.  However, I was somewhat lost because the salty sweetness of the bacon didn't really add much flavor in my opinion.  Maybe fire roasted chopped peanuts could have done the same, but without the confusing taste. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food in a quaint atmosphere.  You have to try their Chicken Katsu... on of the best around."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now the Kalbi short ribs are awesome, it's a great place for lunch or when your looking for something other than a burger and fries"}
{"text":"Kalua Pork tasted very Hawaiian authentic. Went here because it was next to work and saw the high reveiws on Yelp. Glad I did! place exceed my expectations not only in quality of the food but how clean it is. I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try because it's near work and I enjoy hawaiian bbq. They don't have the biggest menu but the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable. Definitely on the list of lunch places to frequent in the area!"}
{"text":"Family owned. Amazing food. Amazing prices. I wish this was closer to my house. I would go weekly. Thank you for the extraordinary food and hospitality."}
{"text":"We happen to be in the area and checked this place out. The food was good, not terrific, but good. A little pricey for the portion size, but we would still eat here if in the area again. Stop by and give it a try for yourself. Definitely has a family owned feel as the cashier was super friendly."}
{"text":"To start with not a very huge look and feel of the restaurant but food is just awesome in one word. I tried the chicken with special sauce and pineapple li hing mui and it was wonderful. The price was very less as compared to the quantity.   The lady in the front was very courteous and polite."}
{"text":"The Kahuku style shrimp was so delicious, I ate it in my car before heading into work. The delicious aroma of shrimp & garlic escaping from the container was driving me insane. I devoured the shrimp & rice in the parking lot of the office. I saved the mac salad for later. Which was eagerly devoured. I will return again for more ono eats. Soon. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"A small mom and pop café that is open on the weekdays only. This café is open mainly for the business people in the area. Staff are very friendly and from Oahu.  We ordered the Chicken Katsu and Lemon grass chicken. The Chicken Katsu was great as was the Lemon grass chicken.  The Lemon grass chicken is slightly spicy. There is some red sauce that is a little overwhelming with the lemon grass flavor.  Plates are very large and you get two scoops of rice and a salad choice with your meal.  There is a parking lot but keep your eyes open because it is easy to drive by this small place.  Very casual and clean inside. Quick service. Great prices. A definite taste of HI.  You will see Hawaiian Sun canned beverages in the cooler and Spam musubi on the menu."}
{"text":"Brought up with Hawaiian food, this was Onolicious!! Great prices, Aloha friendly place."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Da Valley Grill ... a taste of the islands in the desert? Per the reviews, I was so down! Well, perhaps I set my expectations a wee bit high? Don't get me wrong, a solid spot with some classic choices a good quick service lunch if you're in the area.  Everything was good but not 5 star \"best I've ever had\" great.  Service was kind, efficient and fast but food was just meh for us.  We had the following:  The spicy garlic shrimp (not spicy but sweet) and the Locomoco patty had a \"previously frozen\" taste to it. Veggie spring rolls were crispy and delicious.  So an A-Ok if in the area stop for lunch but just not that wowzy ya dig?"}
{"text":"Our meals were made fresh and quickly on the spot. The food was delicious. The owners were super friendly. Glad we found this spot. If it weren't tucked away, I bet they'd have more business. Definitely worth your time and money. Your tummy will be happy!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for lunch Try the sautéed chicken with cole slaw  Dishes are packed with flavor and meals are perfect portion size  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I have to echo Daren's words in regards to the pork. Good lord, that was tender and delicious! I'm normally not even a big fan of pork products, but this place may change me.  Also, the two owners are from Hawaii and give their dishes a very home-cooked feel, as if I was dining in their own home. Definitely recommend going out of your way to eat here; and if you're close by, there's no reason you shouldn't stop in for lunch!"}
{"text":"A little mom and pop shop located in a little little mall strip. We came in during lunch and there was a rush. Bad timing because then the kitchen got behind in orders. There set up is quite small and they can handle only so many orders at one time. They were very apologetic. It was fine but we were just hungry haha. When we got our food it was decent portions. Reminds me of good home cooking."}
{"text":"Great food and great service..tried Kahuku garlic shrimp..soo good and full of flavour."}
{"text":"The place is small, but clean. Thats always a good way to start, right?  So I went on a \"busy day\". The lady who took my order said, \"we are not normally like this [refering to the business]\". I was 5 orders back, and it took about 20-30 minutes to get my food, which was to go. I didn't feel that the time was extraneous, the food tasted as I expected of hawaiian type food.  I ordered the curry Katsu, with cheese? the cheese, was odd, but surprisingly worked. I never had melted cheese on top of katsu. The katsu itself was not greasy, and was not fried too long, which would leave it with a burnt taste. I typically like my curry thicker, but it was still good. Make sure you get it on the side when you order. I asked for it that way. Not sure if they typically do that or not. I was just thinking the breading would be soggy if I didn't....  Overall I'd rate the curry katsu on the average range. It definitely meets my craving.  Also ordered a spam musubi. The seaweed wrapping it was so small. and it was odd that they used seaweed rice seasoning on it... I like all that stuff, just typically I don't put it on a musubi. Anyways...this last part is all preference. I don't think i'd get a musubi here again, just cause I like it a different way."}
{"text":"Small hidden spot, food taste great , price is fair service is good n polite. N its rt next to a big boy store (ammo az) yay yay. Id def come bak, i wanna try all the other food. It is sort of a ways from where i live but at least now when i visit the gun store next door i can chomp down on some bomb hawaiian grubb.!"}
{"text":"Ninja bowl was delicious, basically teriyaki chicken over rice. Nice waitstaff. Would go back any day. Love it."}
{"text":"Great and polite service.  The food is consistently very good.  The Mahi Mahi is fantastic. A great family business."}
{"text":"Kailua pork was awesome! Rice and slaw were a perfect compliment. Amazing how good rice can be when it is cooked just right....wish I knew the secret. Brought home a spam musubi for my son....hope to eat my own next time!  Can easily miss this place! On the north side of the street in what seems like a auto industry dedicated strip mallish development.  Super nice people!"}
{"text":"We had a sunday lunch here last weekend.  The menu is expansive but we decided on teriyaki chicken and kahlua pork.  The food was good but not mind blowing.  I'm not sure if we will be back.  I really wanted it to be better than it was because the owners are so sweet and provided great customer service.  Extra star for the great service and one additional star for the Hawaiian juices and drinks they have."}
{"text":"Awesome, brah! Just like the ol days on the Island. I missed my plate lunches and just found a great substitue in Phoenix of all places! If you know what I'm talking about, you will love the Kahlua pork! And the Loco Moco will bring you home.   If you have no clue what I just said, you still must try this place for a taste of the local (not touristy) Hawaii. This is basically Hawaiin diner food, well-executed. The Katsu shrimp is excellent--lightly battered with good flavor and tasty homemade thousand islandish tartar sauce. Chicken teriyaki is tasty too but the kahlua pork is outstanding. And you have to have the Hawaiian Sun sodas (Hawaiian made and noncarbonated).   The location is challenging in a nondescript strip mall on Deer Valley Road, but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I cannot say how many times I have driven past this place and never came in. Its in an area thats on the brink of sketch, but thats usually where you find the best food. Honestly.   Today I ordered for pick up! And Im glad I did! They are reasonably priced, incredibly fast and very tasty. Its hard to find good quality and decently priced Hawaiian style food in AZ. I hope these guys are here forever.  I ordered the chicken teryaki with rice, and mixed veggies as the side. And an order of spring rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious. Very filling. The chicken teryaki was dark meat, and grilled, the sauce was so good! I know this sounds weird, but it is so difficult to find a good chicken teryaki plate/bowl, anything in AZ!   I also ordered two smoothies, one with boba. One without. They were both very creamy and refreshing.  This is a much needed stop if youre hungry. The only downside is that they close early. But it is still so very worth it. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite soul food spot in North Phoenix! Having been raised on Hawaiian BBQ, this joint has a special place in my heart.   My go to is the chicken katsu with macaroni salad, and a coconut boba smoothie. The one thing to be cautious of, is that this place closes 19:30 (7:30pm) so make sure you order ahead or arrive accordingly. Typically, I order thru yelp and my food is ready for pickup in about 15 minutes.  Chicken is always piping hot, crispy, and full of flavor.   The owners are really kind!!!"}
{"text":"Once I was told about this place I had to try. After living in Hawaii for 4 years, I became fond of the music, beaches and FOOD. Never had a local dish I didn't like. This place is Sooooooo good!!! Real authentic Hawaiian food. Makes you feel like you're there. They have all the local favorites like katsu chicken, musubi and garlic shrimp plates. I always get a spam musubi and a combo plate. The people are so friendly and polite. This is really Hawaiian cooking out in the desert. If you never had Hawaiian food or you have and are looking for the real local flavor. DaValley grill is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"So far my first visit and I'll be back.  I posted a pic of my lunch and a bunch of coworkers asked where it was from and how it was and we will all be ordering this week for delivery.   I had the chicken Katsu with rice and Mac salad.  The sauce was tasty.  I think I'm just used to the flavor of sauce from L&L but I did enjoy this.  I'm very interested in trying more from the menu soon.  It's tasty, totally affordable to make it somewhere we order from often."}
{"text":"Good food and large portions. Had the chicken and rice well prepared and very tasty. Wife had fish and rice in sauce. Both were delicious.. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yep, this place is legit.   I tried this on a whim after driving through the area, looking for something to eat.   I saw the positive reviews that other Yelpers had given and felt it was worth a shot.   I was not disappointed, I was actually quite impressed by the friendly service and the food was quite delicious.   Definitely try the pork, it is an absolute revelation, very tender and juicy with tremendous flavor, was certainly everything others have hyped it up to be.    Beyond that I tried a little of the pineapple chicken which was also quite tasty.    Overall, I'm going to be coming back here and soon, a very nice place run by a friendly couple who do make you feel right at home.       Definitely give this place a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Not much more I could ask for!  Food was amazing with large portions. I had to divvy up my Thai red curry with shrimp into lunch and dinner. It was the perfect amount of spicyness and there was a generous serving of shrimp. A+.   The cashier was super nice and smiley. I asked for her opinion but I went with something else haha.   I will definitely be coming back to try the Laksa curry noodle with shrimp."}
{"text":"Ninja Bowl was GRRRRRREAT!  Very Large potions, 5.99 and I could only eat half Lots of meat"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly peeps. I wish they were open later or had a more convenient location up around happy valley and norterra. I think they cater more to the business lunch crowd. Another recommendation would be to make their menu more easy to understand."}
{"text":"Hungry and looking for something different so I tried this Hawaiian Asian place.I had the kahuku garlic shrimp which had a very unique taste. Definitely recommend their lunch and dinner specials.  They give you a very generous amount of food for the price. Very friendly staff and mesmerizing flavors. For sure coming here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food I cannot get enough of the #15 curry chicken cutlet with cheese and rice it's heaven. I have been here several times and had several dishes all are great and there rice is always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"A coworker recently recommended this place for lunch. It's just a few blocks away. I ordered the fried rice with chicken and pineapple. While I was waiting for my lunch I looked in the cooler and noticed a variety of interesting looking sodas. Anyway the rice was good and I will probably return for lunch again."}
{"text":"I got a kalua pork plate and asked for mac salad, got potato salad instead.  I wasn't a fan of the rice either, but the pork made up for everything and hospitality was great.  Ill be back for the loco moco..."}
{"text":"My friend tells me I undersell this place, maybe I do when it comes to their Kalua Pork which is about as tasty and tender as it gets!  Good portion and an authentic flavor EVERY time I have had it.  Consistency is hard to come by these days.  Small location with limited hours and parking.  It's a lunch when I'm nearby option though I have a feeling I will make the trip out once in a bit.  It's clean and quick.  9 tables with seating for about 25.  Small TV mounted for all to see.  Corner location of a small office mall area (the side of it faces the street)."}
{"text":"Small place, missed it the first time due to a snap on truck. Good selection on the menu of Hawaiian food. I ordered the short ribs with macaroni salad and rice. The short ribs are boneless and absolutely delicious. The macaroni salad was very flavorful, not overdressed, with little bits of carrots onions and I believe celery. Taste like a traditional meal from Hawaii. Would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The food is always so delicious. There's something for all of us. My husband is vegetarian and he can always order his food with tofu instead. The service is outstanding! I've been coming here since we moved to Phoenix from California a few months ago. I'm so glad we found it! The owner is just the sweetest ever. I'm going to be a regular here. I go every week, I have to remind myself that I ate here a couple of days ago but I'm always craving it because it is just that good.  I don't know why it took me so long to write this review. Love it!"}
{"text":"Most of the Hawaiian BBQ places I have tried have awful Kahlua pork but this restaurant's Kahlua pork is so tender it melts in your mouth. The owners are very nice, what a bonus. Please try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh, tasted microwaved. Vegetable spring rolls were mushy. Macaroni salad was decent. I was not impressed with the food as I had higher expectations. Food looks better than it tastes. Staff was super friendly though.  I would not recommend this place and I definitely would not go back again."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian bbq place served all the local favorites such as kalbi (short ribs) and rice, and loco moco. Great friendly staff....I just wasn't a fan of the food, and it's just my opinion that it was only okay.  Not sure if I'd recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Da valley grill has real delicious Hawaiian food ! It is always fresh and delicious!  The staff is very friendly and kind!  Check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is great the food took us back home to Hawaii! Will be going back for the delicious local kine grinds!"}
{"text":"came by this small mom and pop Hawaiian restaurant to check it out with some friends and could not be more impressed.  The food, service, and restaurant itself were all exemplary and really what all mom and pop shops should strive to be like, in my opinion.  We all were able to get \"combos\" of 2-3 of the items on the menu, which wasn't on the menu, but the owner working at the time was more than happy to accommodate for us.  She really went out of her way to give us anything we needed, and was super pleasant throughout the whole meal. The price of the food was pretty fair, and honestly I felt like I was at a friend's house just having dinner with the way she made the food and treated us.  The food itself was excellent. From the musubi to the chicken katsu to the  mahi mahi, I've never had Hawaiian cuisine this good, and was honestly surprised to find it in the middle of Arizona.   Will definitely stop by again, and if yo are around the area, I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Been a dozen times.  Super yummy food.  I'm into the mahi fish, katsu and pork combo now.   Finally nice to get some rice in Arizona."}
{"text":"this is a great family run restaurant that serves Hawaiian plate lunch.. When you walk through the door you can feel the love that they put into everything they do. The Kahlua Pork and Loco Moco are personal addictions of mine. Portion size is large. The various sauces are always fresh. Try one of the Hawaiian Sun fruit drinks.  And they now also feature Boba & Fruit Smoothies.  Da' Valley Grill brings a little Hawaiian 'Aina to the Valley of the Sun  I know this all sounds like a commercial.. But, I really do love this place. it's worth a try trust me"}
{"text":"Never knew this place even existed and I live 5 mins away. Really really good food!!! Super please with the pineapple fried rice and bbq chicken"}
{"text":"Great little authentic Hawaiian style restaurant with a little bit of Asian fusion going on. I got the Loco Moco which was excellent. The beef patty was excellently cooked with a little bit of kalbi meat in it. the rice was nice fluffy and cooked correctly with a thick brown mushroom gravy. Comes with one egg for $7.50 or two eggs for $8. Everything else on their menu looked very good. The service was friendly and fast. Definitely will be coming back and trying some other items."}
{"text":"Excellent yet again. Over easy egg made perfectly. Mahi mahi, chicken Katsu both fried to perfection. Macaroni salad great as always."}
{"text":"Not quite sure how the reviews are so high as my experience does not mirror this at all. My wife and I went in for lunch on a Friday and we're the only people in the place, yet there were signs that people had been there at some point because the tables were filthy. Numerous plates with half eaten food were still sitting on the tables. One would think that if you didn't have any customers you would go about cleaning up, but who knows. So this was our first impression, then came the food. My wife ordered the shrimp and I ordered the pork which both came with rice. The presentation matched the taste: bland. With all the flavor options available in this cuisine I'm not really sure how you can't get that right, but they found a way. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love Hawaiian style food.  This place is great for a quick lunch,   unpretentious, reasonably priced.  Staff is friendly and always helpful. I will always frequent locally run restaurants as opposed to chains.     A bit hard to find in a small strip mall filled with auto repair places."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since its so close to my work. I don't have much experience with Hawaiian food so I wasn't sure what to order, I ordered the chicken Kahtsu with macaroni. It was crispy, and I enjoyed the sauce it came with. The portions are pretty big, staff I'm assuming the owners were very friendly. I'd go back... I did pass it by looking for it, It's pretty small inside but it's clean and well kept."}
