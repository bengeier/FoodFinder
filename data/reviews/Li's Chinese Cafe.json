{"text":"They have the best sesame chicken I've ever had! Their vegetable chow mein is also very good. As the other reviewer said, they have wonderful hospitality. I wouldn't say that we \"frequent\" there. Maybe once every 2-3 weeks or so, but the lady who takes the phone calls (I think she's the owner) knows who I am and what we want to order. It's a great place to get a delicious bite of Chinese food. The portions are also plentiful. Great prices for the quantity and quality of the food. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly wasn't impressed. I came to this spot because of reviews and tried the sesame chicken and was left with much to be desired. I could have gone to Panda Express and purchased better sesame chicken. Also, they don't take credit/debit cards anymore which is extremely inconvenient. I've found First China on Old Monroe to be much better and it's now my go to place for great Chinese good!"}
{"text":"GONE!  This place is CLOSED!  I think the Owners retired!  I ate here one time right before they closed!  The food was so poor I did not want to write a review!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful hospitality. Don't let the humbleness of the venue fool you. This is the best Chinese in the Charlotte area.  I highly Recommend the Sesame Chicken."}
