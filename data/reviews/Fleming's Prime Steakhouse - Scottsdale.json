{"text":"Friday night we two arrived without reservation.  Hostess showed us to table in back of restaurant.  Noticed empty booth and asked if we could sit there.  Walked back to hostess at front and advised yes we could, then shown to booth.  Weak start to a good meal.  Restaurant noisy though not full.  Once seated water promptly brought but without requested lemon.  Lemon brought in wedges on plate at second request.  OK bread with two spreads.  Server and assistant introduced themselves, though runners brought food.  All friendly but never certain who was serving us.

Started with excellent wedge salad.  Asked to shared and brought on two plates.  Good blue cheese dressing and crisp lettuce.  My entree was a huge, delicious pork chop, cooked perfect medium.  Great flavor and taste.  Companions petite 6 oz filet cooked to requested rare plus but a tad over seasoned.  Served with small amount of good potatoes with cheese.  Separate order of outstanding onion rings; ample serving.  Asparagus were grilled and would have preferred steam as flavor lacking.  Table well manicured and servers attentive.  Service fine but flawed.  Steaks and chops are what one goes to Flemings for and they are great."}
{"text":"When dining out, I am a big fan of steak, and great service...Fleming's offers plenty of both.  

Having dined at Fleming's on more than one occasion, I can confidently say that they know how to cook a steak to your requested temperature.  At these prices, this should go without saying, but plenty of chophouses still don't meet this criteria.

All side dishes are a la carte, and on the large side, so I'd recommend sharing.  The potatoes and vegetables are always great dishes.

Mixed drinks are poured well, and not priced too crazy, relative to the entrees.  My staple, a Jack & Coke, was $7.50...I've paid more.  The wine list is extensive if you so choose.

Service was excellent, if a bit methodical...could be a bit more personal.

Four stars instead of five, because everything is just done well...nothing stands out as above and beyond, especially at this price point."}
{"text":"Best happy hour Burger EVER. Especially for $6. The calamari with peppers is also awesome. HH everyday from 5-7."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Just did not give 5 stars because it took a long time to get water and bread (30 min). Other than that, best steak around."}
{"text":"Lots of waiters running around enthusiastically asking us how they could help, but they never replenished my ice tea, or coffee; steak was overcooked and dry, very very expensive, did not tell us about $29 special on Sunday night for prime rib and it was not on menu!  There was a little piece of paper on table about prime rib special which we saw after we had ordered.  Why was it not mentioned?"}
{"text":"The \"Five for six til seven\" is out of this world.  Enjoy the class of this wonderful restaurant without breaking the bank or go for a sit down dinner or brunch any other time of the day.  This place never lets you down no matter what sort of dining experience you are seeking.  

The staff is great and very personalized and have a way of always making you feel special.  The deep wood bar is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"A delicious meal! Every course. Perfect temp on the steak.
They apologized up and down for the slight delay on our main course,but didn't  even realize it was a delayed.

But they more than made up for something that wasn't even noticed.

Exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"I asked an employee at the Arizona Golf Resort in Mesa for her favorite fancy restaurant in Scottsdale and she gave me a bum steer. Wine list is extensive (but heavy on the CA selections) and I found the ipad wine list hard to navigate. Waiter offered a tasting (quite small, not more than a couple of sips) and we requested a second and third and had to pay (a third of the cost of a glass per taste). Finally we chose a $56 bottle of Oberon after paying about 8 dollars for 2 tastes. Struck me as a bit greedy, considering the menu prices. I ordered French Onion soup -- very good altho not quite the traditional method (melted cheese over the pot) and partner had special soup of the nite -- a type of seafood, overpriced I thought at $14. Partner had the BBQ salmon which she said was \"fine.\" I ordered the smallest fillet mignon \"Newport\"  -- overpriced at $36 for something the size of a bar of soap (not the deodorant size; the kind you find for free in hotels). I ordered medium-well and it was medium-rare, and I found its seasonings/salt most disagreeable -- I kept tasting it again for hours afterward (sorry to say). Steak came with their house potatoes - kind of scalloped with cream and cheese and I did not care for the dish; the waiter was kind enough to remove it and offer french fries instead (which were fine). The waiter tried to be helpful but seemed rather inexperienced and hovered around too much. And the busboys were intrusive coming to collect plates seconds after it appeared we were finished with them. Manager offered a discount card on a future meal because I said we were celebrating an anniversary -- a nice touch but not enough to make up for the less than outstanding service, unsatisfying food and overall feeling that we were in one of a chain of restaurants (which we were) which lacked the exceptional quality I have come to expect from pricey places like this one. The price way exceeded the value of the experience. I must say the bread was excellent (but I was annoyed when busboys twice tried to remove the basket when the loaf was only half-eaten)."}
{"text":"Had a really nice birthday dinner here. A little loud inside, but the food and service made up for that. Rodger did an outstanding job and made us feel welcome and well taken care of. We both had petite filet mignons and shared sides of saut√©ed mushrooms and asparagus. Delicious! The filets were done exactly how we like them. A really nice evening!"}
{"text":"We've been to Fleming's numerous times for birthdays and anniversaries.  Amazing food and maybe the best service of any restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale.  We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wow get there early for the happy hour menu. The food is out of this world. Two drinks and two appetizers under $25.  Best deal in town."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  I have been here twice on date nights with my husband.  The first time we ate outside on the patio and I had a filet, baked potato and asparagus.  It was delicious!  Expensive, but worth every penny.  The service was great and we enjoyed ourselves.  The second time we came together we sat at a booth in the bar area for a happy hour dinner.  It was awesome!  We both ordered the burger and it was heavenly.  It was so big and juicy.  The fries were good too and I can't believe how inexpensive it was!  The bacon on the burger was perfection.  We also ordered some calamari, butternut squash ravioli, and the lava cake.   We ate way too much, but it was so good.  I really enjoyed their house red that was on their happy hour menu.  I would highly recommend their happy hour at the bar.  Wow!  We were blown away.  Get there early though because it fills up quick.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've dined here several times and each time have left satisfied and impressed. It's what you would expect from an upscale steakhouse, with a more \"modern\" decor and ambiance. What you can expect is excellently prepared traditional fare of a la carte items such as aged cuts, wedge salad, lobster bisque, blue cheese mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus, and creamed spinach.  Compared with Mortons and Ruth's Chris, I would pick Flemings. The service is always top notch without a bit of snootiness.  This is the only place I have been offered a BLACK cloth napkin as to not impart white fuzz onto my black skirt . I think Flemings has got their act together. I will be going to Capital Grille later this month on a business meeting so I will see if they  can top Flemings - I think they've got a good running, judging from the menu I've seen. I'll report back!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to a Fleming's before, so we decided to try it out for dinner on a Saturday night.  It was our anniversary, so when I booked the table, I mentioned that.  The evening started out just fine.  We were seated immediately and the table was topped with hearts and Fleming's had added a card wishing us a happy anniversary.  

We decided to have a drink before dinner while we looked at the menu.  While we were drinking, a server brought us a small loaf of warm bread with butter and a cheese spread.  Great!

We then decided to order dinner.  I ordered a prime filet medium and my husband after conferring with server ordered a prime strip steak medium rare.  We split a side of Fleming's potatoes.  When our orders came, we were asked to cut into our steaks to see if they met our order.  It was immediately apparent that someone had flipped the doneness.  Mine was medium rare and my husband's steak was medium.  Our server shrugged and said there obviously had been a mix up.  I decided to keep my steak but husband loves medium rare and decided to return his.  The manager came over and instead of apologizing, said we didn't know what medium really meant.  My husband said to him that this wasn't the issue.  The issue was that Fleming's had missed both of our orders.  But no apology for accusing us of not knowing what doneness means.

While I ate my steak and potatoes, my husband just had a share of his potatoes while he waited.  To give credit where it's due, both my steak and our potatoes were good.  I actually didn't mind that my steak was underdone.  When my husband's steak arrived, the server again asked if his steak was done to the correct wellness.  This time, his steak was blue, hot on the outside but absolutely cold on the inside.  He pointed this out to the server who again blamed it on the chefs.  By this point, we'd both had it with Fleming's.

My husband asked for the check and he paid it using his credit card and a $100 gift card we had.  When the bill was returned, the $100 hadn't been deducted!  By now we were really steamed.  My husband again went to the manager and explained that somehow they'd managed to miss the gift card.  He said it had somehow been misplaced but he'd honor it.

There are two other steakhouses within a mile of Fleming's, Maestro's and Preston's.  This horrible experience insures that we will never set foot inside any Fleming's ever again.  The other two places which we have personally visited and loved will get all of our business from this point forward."}
{"text":"It's really difficult to find a decent steak house in Phoenix. I have been frequently to their branches in Chandler, Scottsdale, etc., since I moved to Phoenix one year ago.

I was once a loyal fan of Fleming's steakhouse because of the comfortable environment and nice service, until last night when I visited the restaurant at  \" 20753 N. Pima Road, Scottsdale, AZ\". The service is incredibly bad.

I guess the reason is that my friend and I ordered a sort of \"cheap\" combo this time, the prime rib dinner offered only on Sunday and Monday? Come on, we just wanted to try that because you had sent me a couple of emails advertising that one. 

At the first beginning, all are good, the girls at the reception desk are welcoming as always. You guys even know yesterday was the birthday of my friend. When we sat down, things changed when I said we wanted to try the advertised dinner. *THAT* waitress immediately showed dirty looks on her face and even took the birthday card away rudely which was kindly put on the desk. During the whole dinner, every other waiters are nice, except our waitress, yes, *THAT* lady. That ruined our day.

I will never go to this restaurant any more, neither will my family and friends."}
{"text":"The service was EXCELLENT! No doubt!! Our waiter and water boy was so attentive, kind, and knowledgeable for all our questions.  

The price was fair for the quality of food they serve. I was not impressed by the Fleming potato, but LOVED the crab cake and my Bone In Rib Eye steak. 

Only down fall would be the restaurant was rather loud on the night of our visit and I felt like I was at AppleBee's/ IHop and had to raise my voice periodically to be heard by my friend who was sitting next to me. 

Over all happy with the place! Will go back for special occasion or good piece of steak for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Went because of their $50 gift coupon.  The two for $99 filet and lobster tail special with sides and dessert was perfect.  Not Caesar salad fans but this one was tasty and the fresh bread was a nice start.  Fresh margaritas were made just right.  Leftover dessert came home with us.
Will definitely return for their attention to detail."}
{"text":"Service was sub-par. Had to ask multiple times for iced tea refill, little to no ice, filet for one guest overcooked, ordered bearnaise sauce that never arrived however server was very pleasant when he stopped by. Table was small, chairs encourage one to wrap it up. 13 year old asked me if server didn't like us, I explained unless you've been rude or demanding it is often not personal and is more a reflection of training and a desire to provide good service. A disappointing discussion to have at dinner table. We won't return."}
{"text":"Had my Birthday dinner with my wife and parents and it was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was amazing. The manager even stopped by and remembered us from a few months ago. Just nice people and great ambiance. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Don't expect much on a special occasion . I went for my boyfriend's 40th birthday . There was a card on the table which  was nice but that's all I can say about the experience. The waitress disappeared , 3 managers walking around and not one of them touched our table . Every table around us received a hello , how was your diner , anything else you need ? Not worth the money  to be ignored on a special occasion ."}
{"text":"A group of us had a special dinner at Flemings - reservation for 12 people had been made several weeks in advance.   When we got there, we waited 25 minutes before our table was ready, even though we had reservations.  We were in a semi private room, which was nice. The service was not steller, nor was the food.  I wasn't responsible for paying the bill, but I am sure the \"tip\" was already included.
I do not plan to frequent Flemings any time soon - there are too many places to choose from which offer better service and food worth the price that Flemings charges."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in the Valley. Prime steak burger, string fries and don't forget to start with the sweet pepper calamari - you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever! Awesome prices for delicious food. We keep telling our friends about it, but I kind of want to keep it on the down low for as long as possible! We LOVE coming here!"}
{"text":"Wow. All I have to say is wow. I have been wanting to write this review since we visited last week and just haven't had time. 

My wife and I went last week for dinner and everything from walking in the door to walking out was a treat. Very nice atmosphere with great lighting and music everyone can handle (I personally like it). We got greeted by both managers and a cocktail server while they were getting our table all set up. Upon entering the dining room I was impressed by how nice it all looked. 

Our server, Amber, was excellent. Very nice and always smiled. She was always attentive to our needs and made sure everything was perfect. 

Drinks came out quick. I got a jack and coke and she got a blueberry lemon drop martini. Both were great. I had seconds :-)

As an appetizer we got the crab cakes and a ceaser salad. By far the best I have ever had. The salad was nice and crisp and the crab cakes were just perfect with an awesome sauce.

For dinner we wanted to indulge since we were coming here and I got the Wagyu New York strip and my wife got the Main Filet Mignon. The filet was incredible. Nice and soft. Cooked perfect. Couldn't have been better. Until u try the Wagyu. Granted the Wagyu is a better meat, it was easily noticeable of the quality. For sides we got Fleming potatoes and the Mac and cheese, which were both great and I had a hard time deciding which to eat more of before getting full. 

 And of course, we had to finish off with the chocolate lava cake. I know it is getting repetitive but, wow, best lava cake ever. And it was topped off with delicious whip cream.

While it is expensive, you definitely get what you pay for. We normally do Benihanas as out \"treat\" meal, but I have a feeling things may change. Thank you everyone at Flemings for an absolute treat of a meal. Can't wait to come in for the happy hour burger!!"}
{"text":"Fleming's hosted a corporate event for us last night. The service and overall experience was incredibly positive. The managers and servers were responsive, quick, and polite. The setting was wonderful! All our guests had a great time and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Fleming's to someone in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We never order wine or alcohol at high-end restaurants, as we are not drinkers. Fleming's is one of the only places that does not treat us poorly after discovering that our bill will only include food (hey, we're great tippers!).

The food is incredible, and the staff is very respectful, polite, and friendly. We just love coming back to Fleming's over and over again!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: Be ready to pay a lot of money for a food quality that rivals a mediocre steakhouse. I will not patronize this establishment again.

Pros: The service was good. The scalloped potatoes were excellent.

Cons: Everything is overpriced, and it is not the quality you'd expect. A decent cut of steak is $55+ and a la carte. I tried the pork chop ($37 and a la carte). The waitress recommend having it cooked medium, which I ordered. When it arrived, it was well undercooked (cold rare). The manager took it back and cooked it appropriately. Taste was okay but it was not at the level of a $37 a la carte cut (I could have cooked this pork chop in my oven with Apple glaze and seasoning, and it would have tasted the same). In addition, I like my pork/steak cooked over wood. Flemings broils or cooks over a gas grill."}
{"text":"The chef Jerome is amazing. Never had a better cooked steak! The manager Kryii was superb. Flawless customer service by both individuals!"}
{"text":"We went to Fleming's last Monday and really enjoyed it. Service was top notch. Our waiter, Booker, told us at the end of the evening that it was his third day without supervision--we never would have known! He was extremely knowledgeable, very helpful and courteous--insisted on bringing my daughter a new drink when she admitted she wasn't crazy about what she had chosen (she's 15), funny and personable but not overly familiar, checked in regularly but wasn't obtrusive. Manager came by twice and we got a lovely anniversary surprise of a box of truffles! Food was terrific as well, and we'll have to go back to try more dishes.Steaks were perfection; lobster was maybe a little overcooked. Only four stars because it was extremely hard to find, and we drove around for some time trying to figure out where to park  and where the entrance was--maybe more signage?"}
{"text":"Another bad experience at this location!!  I keep telling myself not to go back and stick to the Tucson location but it was restaurant week and I couldn't resist.  We actually had a reservation at a competing steakhouse but I was craving Flemings and against my better judgment I changed our reservation.  Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the walnut turtle pie is still my favorite!  

To my surprise the restaurant was dead.  At one point I counted the tables in the main dining room and there were only 11 tables at 7:30pm. Biggest problem was that our server had at least 5 of those tables.  Erika (I think that was her name) was friendly and knowledgeable but her service staff failed her.  She got sat 4 tables within about a 15 minute window.  She couldn't keep up.  The food runners and server assistants were just standing around in the kitchen.  The female manager that visited our table was just as useless. 

I couldn't even get my water refilled and forget it if we actually needed anything during our main course.  The manager briefly visited our table to introduce herself but didn't even offer to send someone over to refill my water or bother to ask how our steaks were prepared.  Well...I ordered mine M and it was MW/well.  My husband ordered MR+ and his was black & blue.   

The meal was disappointing and the service was atrocious.  (Sorry Erika - I know you were working your butt off.)  Go spend your hard earned $230 elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Go to mastros city hall in Scottsdale for steak... This chain restaurant is no better than lone star or outback. Too bad was really disappointed with the wait, to be seated and served and average cuts of steak... You can do a lot better ...."}
{"text":"We went out to Flemming's happy hour for the first time since our new baby was born. We sat on the patio and James Blase took care of us. He made our experience so special and enjoyable. The service/food/ambiance was so  great we will probably remember forever!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Took my brother there for his birthday and not only did they give a dessert, the manager came over, introduced himself, and gave us a gift card! Our server was wonderful too. Can't wait to to back. The food is over the top excellent. A++"}
{"text":"My verdict: Decent food, good service, laughably overpriced. I won't be back.

I will say up front that they showed outstanding customer service. I'd made a reservation but when my girlfriend was running late, I found that she had gone to the wrong Fleming's. They actually took the time to call DC Ranch and let them know she would be late, and when she arrived 45 minutes late, we were seated immediately. I was impressed: our reservation was for 7:00 on a Friday night and the place was packed, but they didn't give up our table. And throughout the meal we were taken care of in a professional and courteous manner. 

My steak was ordered medium rare and was overcooked, so I sent it back. It's the first time I've ever done that, but when you pay almost $50 for a fillet -- everything is a la carte -- you expect it to be perfect. By the time I got my steak, my date had finished most of her meal, despite trying to wait for me, and everything else was cold. She ordered a glass of wine, I had water. She ordered an appetizer for her meal and we shared two sides. The bill? $125 before tip, $150 after.

The quality of the food? The steak, asparagus and sauteed mushrooms were almost exactly how I make it at home, which is not a compliment to Fleming's. I'm a decent cook and buy my fillets from AJ's or Whole Foods, but I expected better from such a touted chain. Like another reviewer said, at these prices, I expect amazing.

There were four people up front greeting and seating. We were \"touched\" by no fewer than three different people as part of the meal. I realize that it's DC Ranch -- I used to live there and know what the vibe is like, people like to be pampered -- but c'mon. The place was overstaffed, which later made me resent how much I paid for the meal.

Then there is the black napkin thing, which was mentioned by another reviewer as a positive. Yes, it *would* be a positive, but we were actually asked by our first server if we would prefer black napkins. Pretentious and unnecessary. Just serve black like some steakhouses do and don't offer a choice, as if it's some big deal.

I eat at nice restaurants often, so when I say Fleming's is overpriced, I really mean it. I listed our meal above exactly, and tell me honestly, in Scottsdale, that isn't overpriced. There is a reason why they don't list their prices on their Web menu. Had I known the quality we would get for such high prices, I would have chosen Mastro's, Morton's or Ruth's Chris. As professional as the staff was, and as nice as the decor is, they have nothing more to offer than other fine steakhouses than higher prices."}
{"text":"Food is average. For the price they demand the steak was average. Kids meal had more steak and fries than the primary entrees. Not a high end restaurant. Water served was warm. Portions too small"}
{"text":"Top notch service. We recently celebrated a very special anniversary with a small group. Everyone went above and beyond. Seth C, the manager made sure my family had a memorable evening. He continually checked in to make sure everything was going well and even brought in Chef Jeff to introduce us as well as bring the Anniversary couple some special truffles.  Our server Justin was very attentive from the time we got there until the time our meal was over. Thank you team for a memorable night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had reservations for our anniversary last weekend. When we arrived we were informed that we had to wait for our table to become available. So we waited....and waited.....and waited.  We waited for almost an hour--the hostesses made no attempt to apologize and were rude when we inquired how much longer we would have to wait. Finally we were seated. Then, we waited and waited again...this time for someone to serve us. No one approached our table. Another couple seated after us were served immediately... My husband and I finally got tired of waiting and  left the restaurant. Don't waste your time and money on this place....there are too many other good choices in Scottsdale. I was so disappointed that our special anniversary dinner didn't happen...I won't be back and I will not be recommending this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"I haven't come up with any resolutions for 2011, so I think I will resolve to give lots of unsolicited advice to friends, family, coworkers, and the public in general...and what better way to do that than Yelp!

The little lady and I decided we would start the New Year with a nice dinner (the little lady is a vegetarian BTW, and will be referred to as \"LL\") and due to a generous xmas gift and some vegetarian options we headed to Fleming's with visions of prime steak dancing in my head.

Fleming's boasts an impressive 100 wines by the glass, which makes for a very relaxed and user-friendly wine experience.  However, I immediately saw on the way in they don't have a single beer on tap.  Craving a Stella or microbrew or something beerish this was a bit of a bummer but no big deal.  I guess I could suffer through a bottle if I had to.

We were \"greeted\" by the hostess (I've had more enthusiastic greetings at McDonald's) and then she stared down at her screen to find the reservation.  There was enough of a delay I had one of those airport/hotel/rental car type moments thinking they had lost the reservation and would be turned away or asked to sit at the bar--but luckily this wasn't the case and we were promptly seated.

I started with the vodka martini (not made as specified but fine nonetheless) and LL had some prosecco concoction with elderflower liqueur (delicious).  Service was prompt and attentive, although I had a feeling our server was either brand new or a temp called in.  She didn't even know the dressings for the salad!

As for help on wine about all she could offer was the intensity of the wine increased as you went further down the list--clearly stated on the menu.  She was also unaware of what was truly vegetarian and didn't offer up any \"super-secret-black-ops vegetarian options\".  For those that haven't had the \"pleasure\" of dating a vegetarian (not vegan thank god!) most decent restaurants will modify dishes or make up something special to accommodate--so with Fleming's it looks like the mushroom ravioli was the way to go for any true entree feel....which is fine, I realize we were at a steakhouse!

LL started with the caesar salad with ranch (traditional dressing has anchovies) and I had the french onion soup.  Both were fine, nothing to write home about.  Mine was even a bit cool of all things.  Our entrees arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I had the main filet, and our sides included the mushrooms and Fleming's potatoes.

I have to say I was disappointed in the steak.  It was the largest filet offered, but didn't seem very impressive when it came out...and was kind of in two pieces...so not the nicest looking piece of meat I've seen.  After having a few bites I also realized it was a solid medium instead of the medium rare I had requested.  In hindsight I should of sent it back, but in reality I'm just not much of a send it back type of guy.  I guess I'm more of the eat it/don't eat it and complain about it on Yelp type of guy.

To sum things up, we had a really nice dinner and the server was extremely attentive and cheerful.  It's certainly not her fault she hasn't been properly trained on the menu--although she could of just admitted as much instead of trying to wing it!  However, for $200 with tax and tip you have to at least do what you do best: serve me up a fantastic prime cut of steak and cook it how I want it!  I know I could go to Basha's right now, buy a \"choice\" cut, and cook it properly on my POS grill with better results.  For this I'm feeling pretty generous with the 3 stars.  Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service as always from Manager Cory.  Nice booth tonight & lots of special attention for our celebration."}
{"text":"Amazing wine dinner last evening sponsored by Flemings.  Enjoyed the \"chefs showdown\", wonderful wines and meeting great people.  Thank you Seth Camp for putting together such a fun event."}
{"text":"I refuse to go someplace that lies about having an opening.  Walked in person with no reservation and they told me that they were booked for the night but yet there were tons of tables with nobody sitting at them.  I go sit in my car and look them up online and they have reservations available.  When I called about making a reservation they had no problem whatsoever getting a seating.  I chose to go somewhere else.  If you can't have enough integrity to be honest to my face about coming to your place of business and lie to my face about being able to eat there, then I won't be eating there ever and I doubt my friends will either!  To top it off they don't allow firearms either.  I would rather eat somewhere that has integrity to their customers instead of being lied too directly to my face.  Honesty is pretty important in my opinion especially if it a place of business."}
{"text":"Went there Aug 28,2011 reservation 6:30 pm- ordered our drinks, got our bread( their bread is so good) and gave our orders( prime rib special). The place was packed- ... Then everything just went south! Ordered bread twice - never arrived- and the food took so long.  We have eaten here several times and generally had a good time- this time was a first bad experience! And they ran out of the lava cake too! Now that's really bad!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner #1 with mom at Flemings was a great experience. Both of us are first-timer at Flemings but really enjoyed our nights. 

Reservation at 6:30 on a Saturday night in the private room section, a perfect seating for us as it was much quieter. Our dinner consisted a shared plate of calamari, two petite filet with a side of grilled asparagus and sauteed mushroom. 

Calamari plate was very big, pre-mixed with the hot n sour (though it says hot and sweet) sauce, not the typical calamari I had tried, especially there were sauteed red pepper, onions and some very sour jalapenos. Overall it was ok, the outside layer of calamari isn't as crispy as I wanted, probably because it was already mixed with sauce.

Now to the main dish, steak!! We both opted for the petite size, it was perfect for us, very well accompanied by the grilled asparagus and sauteed mushrooms. My medium rare filet came out very nice and juicy. If only my mom doesn't eat her steak at well-done, i would have ordered a bigger steak to share (of course to save money too!) oh well, we both only want what we like :p

For dessert, we chose the famous lava cake. Well, it came out very neat looking with two scoops of ice cream and a little candle, but the cake itself was a bit too bitter for me, it was very very dark chocolate. I normally do like dark chocolate, but this lava cake, if no ice cream was accompanied, i don't know how many bites I could take.

 Our overall experience was great, very nice staff and attentive services! And because we went for birthday, yay for a $25 gift card for the next visit !!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine when I visit Scottsdale.   Delicious food, great wine selection and a can-do staff who always finds that line of warmth and attentiveness without trying to become a member of your dining party.  Comfortable seating and great sunset views from the outdoor seating area make it high on my to-do list each time I return to Scottsdale.  They have no fear of going off menu for you and always do it very well.  In the dozens of times I have been there (and hundreds of times I'll go back) I have on one occasion gotten a filet that was less than excellent.  But just once.  This is why they get four stars instead of five.

The prices are steep and everything is offered a la carte but in the context of such a quality experience overall, I find it well worth the price."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a great birthday dinner with the filet mignon and lobster for $45. It was dreadful. Three of us went to dinner and all ordered the same deal and we all arrived at the same conclusion. The fillet was more like sirloin and the lobster was inedible. It was small and dry. I actually feel like we were robbed! I will not go back to Flemings - It should be called FLUMBINGS!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cozy yet sensual place to have dinner, this is it. Came here on a Sunday a few weeks ago for their prime rib dinner for 2 deal. The waiter helped us pick out wines that did not disappoint. The meat melted in my mouth and was so good I barley used the dip because the flavor was so great. Their chipotle Mac and cheese was fantastic. Last but not least their dessert was the cherry on top, the homemade whip cream was amazing in itself! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Other than a snotty girl who seated us in a crappy table and told us there wasn't anywhere else available, despite our reserving a booth, we had a wonderful time.  We quickly realized we were not going to deal with the attitude hostess girl and went back to the front desk where they promptly seated us in a booth.  The snotty girl needs to realize who is paying her salary - ugh, the customer!!  The rest of our evening was wonderful.  Excellent service, great food.  The Filet Mignon, chipotle mac & cheese that is always to die for and nice french green beans with mushrooms. Pricey but great food and so worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Flemings is, for me, just about as good as a steak house gets.  Warm, inviting and not pretentious.  If I had to pick nits (and I do) I would just say the service can be breathtakingly fast - so if you're going to linger over martini's, make sure your waiter knows not to fire your order until you're ready.  Oh yeah, the martinis are large, cold and good.

Otherwise the service is top notch.  I really like a place where waiters are trained to observe every table, not just their own.  When we needed something, as soon as we looked around for our waiter, another waiter noticed and came over immediately to assist.  As soon as we were done with one course a passing waiter picked up the dishes, checked on our experience so far and asked if there was anything else they could do. That makes for a great dining experience.

The Porcini rubbed tenderloin in gorgonzola sauce was great.  Ask for extra sauce on the side and you'll get some chunks of gorgonzola in it.  The added texture really helps the sauce. 

The scallops in lobster cream sauce were equally good.  Slightly crisp outside, sweet on the inside, perfectly complemented by the lobster cream sauce.  The vegetables served with the scallops were perfectly done.

The mushroom ravioli is a must-get.  We always share it, it could easily be a perfect light entree for one.

The atmosphere is dark (as a steak house should be) but not too dark.  There is none of the pretentiousness of some other houses and the staff are willing to accommodate almost any request.

Thanks Nick! 

5 stars!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our father's bday and had a delicious dinner (ask for any special seasonal menu which they don't offer if you don't ask.)  For dessert one guest ordered the lava cake. The waiter brought one out with a candle and placed it in front of Dad. We sang, he began happily eating it. When the person who ordered the cake asked if theirs was forthcoming, the waiter said - we had to have something to put a candle in, that was yours. Really?? They charged for the cake and gave Dad a box of truffles at the end of dinner as his bday comp. Not classy and rather uncomfortable. Sorry Flemings. That was not up to par."}
{"text":"We ate here for Easter dinner with a special friend while on spring break. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food quality was very good. In fact, one member of our group ordered a petite filet, med rare. It was not cooked properly. The waiter took it back immediately and brought another. The replacement looked like a 10oz or 12oz. And they took it off the bill anyway. Dessert was great and our wine selection was perfect. Although we don't live in Scottsdale, I can recommend this location."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Took the family here for Christmas dinner (2015).  They loved it!  We reserved our table well in advance of Christmas.  However, upon arrival, the lobby was standing room only and we were forced to wait 40 minutes after our reserved time for a table.  Not great when you're spending this kind of money on dinner.  The food itself was delicious, it always is.  I've eaten at several locations and the food is delicious every time.  Highly recommend trying the prime rib on Sundays.  The special is usually $29.99 - $34.95 for prime rib, side, salad, and desert.  Phenomenal deal!"}
{"text":"Restaurant has a nice ambiance. Service was attentive. Drinks were good. The food however was really overpriced for what you got and disappointing. Steak was over cooked, portions seemed a lot smaller than a normal 8 oz/12oz serving, and seasoning was lacking. I can honestly say the best thing I had all night was the creamed spinach."}
{"text":"We actually came here sometime in late march.
I have never experienced service so awesome. The very nice waitress was helpful and attentive.
We both ordered a petit filet, my friend ordered medium, I ordered medium-rare. 
Now I am a bit of a stiffler with my steak. My steak came out medium/ medium - well done. I did mention that to my waitress and she looked at it, immediately agreed with me and took it back to the kitchen. 15 minutes later I receive a brand new steak and the chef comes out personally to find out whether the steak was fine now.
Let me tell you, this was the very best steak I have ever had. PERFECT! Simple, awesome perfection. 
And a level of customer service that I have not found often in the US.
The waitress even gave me a gift card to make up for the kitchens mistake, so my next steak is free, Wow. Also their flemin potatoes (a potato gratin) is great and definately worth a try.
Food: A+
Customer service A+
Ambiance B+

If you want a great experience, top quality service and an awesome steak, check out flemings!"}
{"text":"Decided this year to pass on the Thanksgiving after-meal mess and pay someone else to do the cooking and cleaning.  Unfortunately, the cooking part didn't come close to a home cooked meal. I have actually had better at Denny's. Turkey was fairly tasteless and dry. The sides were unremarkable as well.  Sorry, but we expected a bit more quality for a place like this."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I expected. All the ranting and raving I hear about this place, well it's on the lower end of places where I would eat steak. Asked for Medium steak and received closer to medium well. Don't think I'll be visiting any time soon. Creme brulee dessert was not better than the Keg."}
{"text":"Absolutely FANTASTIC. Best steakhouse I have ever been to. Thanks to Yelp, I decided to take my boyfriend here last night for his birthday. I called to make reservations in the morning and wasn't able to get in until 8pm (fine by me). First off, the bread was delicious (came with 2 types of butters). For appetizer, we had the carpaccio-it was a full plate of it with pieces of toasted bread on top! For the entree, we both had filet mignon. Mine came with the Fleming's potatoes (A MUST TRY). His came with crab stuffed shrimp and asparagus. For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake! OMG this was sooo good. I'm so glad we ordered this and it definitely satisfied my sweet tooth!! This place also has a large wine list--bottle prices were from  the $30's to $600's. If you don't finish it, they cork it and seal it in a bag for you to take home. Because it was my boyfriend's birthday, the manager gave him a $25 giftcard for next time. In addition, every staff member we talked to said happy birthday to him (I mentioned it was his birthday when I made the reservation over the phone). Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable on the food & wine as well. What amazing service and staff! The only negative thing for me would be the noise-but it was only because it was so busy!

Overall, this place is worth every penny! Thank you Fleming's...we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Four stars because we decided to cancel our reservation and went straight to the bar.  There were two hostesses: one was nice, courteous, the other one was rude and full with attitude toward the costumes. Really, we weren't in a mood to be greeted by her so we decided to hit the bar for HH.  Brian, the bar tender was great! He mixed good drinks, took our orders and the food were served in no time."}
{"text":"I called to make some requests for an upcoming reservation. All of the requests were met and we were treated like rock stars. 
Salad cold crisp and lightly dressed. Steak, spinach and potatoes all excellent   - what a delightful experience all the way around Sande s"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've visited this spot and I wasn't disappointed. My boyfriend and I came for dinner tonight and we arrived about 10 minutes past our reservation time. Oops. No big deal though, the hostess was able to get us seated quickly. Then again it was a Wednesday night so it wasn't too crowded. 

Service: Our server was extremely attentive without seeming pushy and annoying, perfect. We were also greeted by the manager which was nice and each person that stopped at our table to help was efficient and polite. 

Ambiance: Perfect lighting, bathrooms were clean, almost ate shit in my heels because the floor was either just waxed or slippery as hell. Oh well. Noise level was perfect, not eerily silent but also not too loud. 

Food: We both ordered the filet and lobster 3 course special and it really hit the spot. We started out with an amuse-bouch of scallop on a bed of something I don't remember and cherry tomatoes. It was delicious. Then I got the wedge salad, I should have gotten dressing on the side but I wasn't thinking at the time. Too much dressing freaks me out. Oops again. The main course came out shortly after and my steak was cooked perfectly to my order. My boyfriend's steak was a little undercooked but it was no big deal. Lobster was also fantastic, our server de shelled our lobsters for us. Perfect. I couldn't finish my steak but I did manage to snatch the rest of my boyfriend's lobster, yay! Then came the desert of my dreams. I had the deconstructed s'mores and it was to die for. The marshmallow was perfectly fluffy and with the scotch in the chocolate, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I would actually come back every day just to get this for my sweets fix. 

Price: We had an amazing deal, but seriously, don't come here if you're not willing to put your wallet to work. 

Overall, great service, ambiance, and food. 

P.S. Writing this as I finish the rest of my s'mores."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!  Have been here 2 times and both times our order was screwed up.  First time they forgot to put all our side orders in.  Second time they over cooked all 3 of our steaks.  Never offered any compensation!!!  Worst steakhouse around!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different for Christmas eve this year. Decided to go to Flemings for happy hour at the bar. Their happy hour menu was great, before we even ordered anything for dinner they gave us a bowl of homemade chips which were excellent I could've just eaten those for dinner. The fried calamari was great, and the seven dollar cheeseburger with bacon was extraordinary."}
{"text":"WOW!  Fleming's delivered in spades!

This is my favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  The food is exceptional, the wine list is out of this world, and the dress is casual!  It is a bit pricey for me, but man is it worth it.  I have never had a better Fillet and all of their wines are very well picked and represent a wide range of pricing and styles.

I can't go there often, but man am I happy when I do!"}
{"text":"A special night, one anniversary one birthday and a very disappointing evening.which was marred but very mediocre food and an overbearing waitress.

To sit and visit while enjoying your drinks was interrupted by a waitress trying to get an order while half the restaurant was empty. The food -salads OK, entrees - shrimp was dry and tasteless, scallops small plate was not inspiring, beef kabob was not good either, but my filet was very nice.

Having had good meals in the past and to go to an upscale top restaurant and receive this annoying service and less than stellar food is very disturbing and I would think it will be a long time before we return.

I was embarrassed in choosing this restaurant and felt bad that our friends had to pay so much for so little on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"After extensive analysis, and I do mean extensive, our happy hour research team has determined that Flemings has the best happy hour bar food. I mean, the drinks are fine but where else can you get carpaccio, ahi, crab cakes or a very good burger for $6? Seriously."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a great experience and a great meal.  I was by myself and decided to eat at the bar.  Upon entering I was greeted by a friendly hostess who I asked if I could go to the bar and she said yes, it's open seating.  She could have walked me over if she really wanted to impress, but hey...

Upon entering the bar, I was quite disappointed with the ambiance or lack thereof.  When you go to a nice steakhouse especially the bar, you don't expect it brightly lit and plainly decorated - plain painted walls and poorly positioned tv's that were not large enough to view from where they were positioned way off to the far corners of a very tall ceiling.  

You expect hip and fashionable with good music and vibe.  Especially when you ar paying $10 and up per drink...

The night was more of a disappointment from there.  I was given a menu and a wine menu but never asked if I wanted to order a drink.  I finally had to ask the bartender, a guy on the shorter side, not that it matters, who seemed to be too busy socializing with the waitresses and staff than to consider my drink order.

I will say he was a friendly guy and I can see why he was so popular with the staff b/c all he did was socialize with them over and over again.  

Ultimately, he suggested the petite filet over the Scottish Salmon which he said was wild caught.  I went with his suggestion and asked for it medium which he said would be pink in the middle which I said was fine. 

I also ordered the tomato salad w/beets and was disappointed with the arugula as it appeared a bit wilted and the tomatoes were not chilled which they need to be to make this salad good.  Same with the room-temp beets.  Dressing was decent.

I was working on my salad when the female bartender came over to me and asked me if I was done with my salad which I clearly was 
not.  It was awkward b/c my steak was ready as one of the servers had come out and told her as I could see them conferring off to the side of the bar.  I told her I would be ready in a couple of mins and then realized that I should have probably just let them bring it out.  

After finally getting her attention back, I asked to have it brought out.  Five mins later I was presented with a petite filet that clearly had been sitting on a hot plate and under a heat lamp as it was quite dry.  It also was a disappointing cut and had some fat on one side which I have never experienced before at a fine steakhouse...disappointing to say the least.  I also ordered the saut√©ed spinach with oil, no butter and that was pretty good.  There were red onions in it which I typically don't like, but these were well-cooked and seasoned to my liking so I ate them.

I had asked for a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany my steak and he recommended a glass of the PREDATOR
Zinfandel Lodi Old Vine, 2012/13.  It was hugely oaky and frankly the most overbearing red I have ever had.  I asked him to smell the bouquet or even try a sip.  It's then that he admitted he had never tried it.  Why would he recommend something he had never tried.  The wine was terrible so he poured me a glass of the Syrah which was much better.

I looked at a menu nearby and saw that Flemings is part if a broader chain and then realized what I was dealing with.  It is their highest end brand I believe and I don't think it is being closely watched from the corporate offices; at least not this one.

I finished my meal and the plates sat there for a good 20 mins without being cleared.  This is at the bar, mind you where the staff is basically on top of you by design.  I finally asked him for a refill on my water and 5 mins later he filled it for me after taking care of several other customers first.

On the positive side, the waiter suggested I not try the Chocolate Lava Milkshake since I told him I had to be up at 4 a.m. the next morning and had a trip to Hawaii  planned the following month.  With just that advice  I avoided a hangover as well as likely close to 10,000 calories.  He scored back some points for that one.

All in all, a lot of money for a average meal with no ambiance...likely wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it until managment instills a higher level of professionalism in the staff."}
{"text":"I treated a group of friends and my partner to Easter Brunch at Fleming's.  We were greeted and taken to our table right away.  Sara F. was our waitress.  Sara F. gave us impeccable service.  The food itself, was outstanding.  Nothing but class. Thank you Fleming's and Sara F for an amazing experience."}

Another visit to our favorite steakhouse! 
Food and service was exceptional (as usual) our server Erica F. provided wonderful advice and worked to make sure that our visit was superb (Again, as usual) 
The managing partner Darrin's personal attention and genuine interest in our dining experience set this location in a class by itself. 
Thank you for another memorable evening out with our friends!

{"text":"If you're looking for a 2 star steakhouse, that's pretending to be 5 stars, then this is your place.  Wait staff was awesome, friendly, and very courteous.  The wine list was good, their cuvee selection is weak (but the one that they do offer is rocking), but that's where all the magic comes to an end.

We ordered two appetizers.  Muscles: I give it an A for effort and C- for delivery.  Clearly a rushed effort, and the broth had strong alcohol taste to it (they didn't give it enough time to burn off).  Had they taken their time, the taste would have been good.  Calamari: C+ at best.  They over-drowned the fried calamari to a soggy mess.  Real disappointing all the way around.

Caesar salad was awesome.  (so only order this, and you'll be okay).

Steak was prepared appropriately, but it really lacked blue ribbon quality meat taste.  Surprising given some of the best beef ranches are on this side of the Mississippi.  The meat was grocery story quality and they should really re-think their supplier.  Easy thing to fix given the price point.  

Side dishes were decent, but nothing note worthy.

Over all, at this price point and atmosphere, there are far better options in the North Scottsdale area.  I wouldn't recommend this, if you don't mind driving 5 minutes in just about any direction."}
{"text":"I ate at Fleming's and was impressed at first, but that went downhill soon.  I asked my server to leave off the spicy oil and my overpriced steak came with the spicy oil on it.  Instead of bringing me an entirely new steak, the server returned with the same steak still having the spiciness on it.  I did not enjoy it at all and just wanted to leave.  I was so disappointed that I didn't even feel like complaining, and left a lot of food left over.  I have eaten at 2 star restaurants with better food and service.  A very overrated place and very over-priced.  No steak is worth paying $50.00 for it!  I did complain the next day but no one ever contacted me.  I will never go there again, nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow never thought i'd be so disappointed with a big name like Fleming's. I dined here with my wife for a late valentines day since we where both working on the 14th. 

I'll start off with the good: the service was friendly, on point, and knowledgable about the menu. The appetizers were good mushroom ravioli and french onion soup as well as the steaks cooked just as ordered and very tasty. 

The bad: a la carte menus mucho dinero for a little steak and nothing else. The side I ordered, asparagus, was pretty scorched on the bottom for the price they should be cooked perfectly. My wife ordered a special lobster tail, small filet, and Flemings potatoes. Lobster tail was way overcooked to the point were the waiter could barely get it out of the shell and it tasted like rubber, the potatoes were bland and could have used more seasoning and to top it off the plates were hotter than hell like they had been left up in the salamander for to long. Lastly the restaurant was just a little to warm and caused us to sweat through our meal. 

Overall I will certainly not be returning and would not recommend to a friend.

2/20/2014 Update- the restaurant manager contacted the the next day after reading my review and sent a gift card to give Flemings another shot, I will update my review when we revisit this location."}
{"text":"Received a gift card in the mail so took my family there on Sunday.  My wife and I each ordered the Prime Rib special.  When our salads arrived, my wife's salad contained a paper label in it which I'm guessing was from the head of lettuce used to make the salad.  When the manager came, he just asked if she wanted another salad and that was it.  While the prime rib, side dishes (Sauteed Mushroom and Asparagus) and dessert (molten lava cake) were very good, I was disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience with server, Tommy Warren. He's extremely knowledgeable about wine and the menu was attentive yet let us enjoy our conversation. The food is also fantastic but Tommy is a reason to return for sure."}
{"text":"I would have to rate Fleming's as my favorite Chain Prime Steakhouse! Especially once you start receiving coupons and invitations via email it makes Fine dining somewhat more affordable (if that even goes together) LOL! A discount on $100 dinner helps out. I would definitely recommend them over a few other well-known Fine Dining Prime Steakhouses for a special occasion. 

I absolutely love the flavor of the Filet Mignon so tender and buttery and they have the perfect balance of salt & pepper seasoned on there I try to cut the pieces as small as possible so it will last as long as possible. Their sides are great too the macaroni & cheese, creamed corn, and potatoes are great. The cr√®me Brule & cheesecake are my favorite desserts. 

The Service is great too even better if you go on a weeknight cause it is quieter more romantic for a special occasion without the background noise, everything is so clean, they servers are very knowledgable on the menu the way things prepared and perfect wine pairings for what you're eating. 

My biggest complaint is they discontinued my favorite cocktail it was like sweet but had a spicy bite to it cause the bartender drops a little tabasco sauce in there so every time you take a sip it gives you a kick! OMG it was awesome I went back and they said they no longer have the main ingredient for it Mango Puree so they had to discontinue it NOOOO!"}
{"text":"Melissa is absolutely amazing. GREAT HAPPY HOUR!!! The volcano chocolate cake is delicious. The best bargain is Fleming's $8 Happy Hour Cheese Burger & Fries. I get the gift card from Costco which is a great price which saves some $$$. Also they give $25 gift-cards sometimes too. Great atmosphere and even better food. Fleming's is both a high end steak house for special occasions and a quick easy happy hour stop. Thank you"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant last night, it was extremely busy as any steakhouse in Scottsdale would be. They said the only seating they had was outside it was comfortable outside so we decide to go out. What they didn't tell us was that they have had a sewer problem and throughout our four hundred dollar meal. We could smell the sewer backing up and our waitress said its been a problem for the past week. What irritates me with this restaurant is they should've never sat us outside knowing the problem they had. The manager came by and said oh we're more than happy to move you inside with our meal In front of us.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if it was the only restaurant in town so take your chances there are plenty other steakhouses in Scottsdale that treat their customers a lot better than this one did"}
{"text":"Took my managers here for our dinner meeting. 

Decent apps and ok entrees other than the skewer stick stuck in my overly cooked and overly priced corporate volume purchased filet mignon. 

Mystified waiter came back from kitchen saying \"... It's how we hold the steak together.\". Really?

They compensated me with a free drink (yay) and an undercooked lava cake (yay). 

$650 bill for 5 people.

Hmm, think I'm done with this chain, I'll just take my money to Outback next time."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the fact I consumed too much vodka before the nights dinner, but my NY strip steak was one of the best I've ever had. It was just seasoned on the outside and was juicy on the inside . Why not a 5 star, well, I'm not sure if it was the alcohol doing the tasting."}
{"text":"Tonight was our third trip to Flemings so I thought it was fair enough to add my review.

Flemings is just ok - more of a 2.5 than a 3.

Twice I've had the filet, first time was not cooked as ordered, second time cooked as ordered, tonight I tried the filet skewers, not cooked as ordered - not impressed with the cuts on any of my visits and they seem to avoid seasoning of any kind - meh.  The mozzarella salad on the side of my skewers was old with mealy tomatoes and wilted everything else.

A bowl of greasy homemade chips on the table - no thanks.  Short rib appetizer, nice portion, very tender, maybe just a bit too fatty, nice spicy slaw but a sweet watered down BBQ sauce on the plate that tanked the whole deal.  Baked brie was not as good as I can make at home with 5 apple slices and 3 walnuts - thanks cheapskate.

Husband had the lamb chops, not cooked as ordered but he enjoyed them.

Mac and cheese has been good every time.

Great selection of wines by the glass and I like the small plate + wine offering.

The service was terrible tonight but it has been every time I've been here.  Tonight's gal was friendly enough but she was absent and inattentive the entire time.  We ordered our appetizer 10 minutes before ordering our entree and yet just as the apps were delivered, I saw the kid with our dinners in hand do a quick u-turn back to the kitchen - hoping we didn't see him.

Don't get me wrong, this place isn't a total train wreck - I would certainly pop in for a glass of wine at happy hour and there are good deals to be had, it's cheap enough for sure...just don't come here expecting a top notch steak house - this isn't the place.

Case in point, we tried to get into the Capital Grille and Mastros tonight but they were both booked solid - no problem at Flemings."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to flemings a few times, The last time we were there the food was very expensive and of poor taste.Also we noticed that some of the bar tenders that worked there was very professional and of good manners.,and no longer there, Flemmings what are you thinking firing the ones that works the hardest for you to make you who you are today I see that in the future you will no longer be in business by treating customers, and the help the way you do, shame on you, I have told all my friends and several others to boycott you, because you guys don't treat people or help the way they should be treated. My own feelings are you should not be in business with the public. I hope other people read this and think again about spending money in your establishment."}
{"text":"It has been quite a while since I last visited this restaurant (about a year ago). I met my best friend there and all I remember is that the food was delicious and the service provided by the wait staff was excellent. Good wine was also flowing freely at our table, which may or may not have contributed to my not remembering exactly what I had for dinner that evening. However, I would very much like to go back and dine at Fleming's.  :-)

Ps- I do remember the manager stopping by our table to check in on our group to make sure we were being well taken care of.  That's always appreciated."}
{"text":"Took my wife for our anniversary and wow!  Dinner was awesome!! The waiter, Brian B. was right on with the wine recommendations, even after I wanted to try different types.  We started with the Modern Caesar Salad which was really great. Then my wife had the Petite Filet which was cooked perfectly and I had the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass which was probably the best fish dish I've had in many years, it was simply awesome.  For sides we shared the Flemings Potatoe's and the Crispy Brussels Sprouts and both were delicious.  The manager checked in on us a few times and of course Brian was always nearby if we needed anything.  The staff presented us with a Happy Anniversary Card and some house made chocolate truffles, yum. All in all a very wonderful and memorable anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner.  Steaks were great.  Mushroom Ravioli appetizer was delicious and the service was great.  The manager was setting a great example by pitching in and working as hard as the waitstaff. She was attentive and professional.  Nice experience."}
{"text":"Knocked Ruth off the top of my list.  Sorry lady.  My only issue is that the size of each portion of meat is not listed on the menu.  My meat was cooked to perfection (which is my requirement), and the wait staff was personable. I am a convert. Thank you Fleming's. I am in love."}
{"text":"Scottsdale road has just about everything including Oscar Filet at Flemmings, ohhh yea !  Talk about decadent, they were serving a special the night we were there that 
included the Oscar topping for the filet. Something about jumbo lump crab meat slathered on top of a perfectly cooked steak that is...... well..... just plain awesome! 

Add a side of asparagus and a wedge salad with a nice cocktail and damn if that is not the start to a kick ass evening. 

As always this location on the weekends was packed including the bar area, thank goodness for reso's.  Something about this Flemming's has more je ne se qua than 
the \"run of the mill\" Flemmings( if there is such a thing)."}
{"text":"We just moved to Scottsdale. Celebrating my husband's birthday, we had many local places to check out but he chose Fleming's, tried and true celebration destination. We have been to many various Fleming's locations and service/food never disappointed. I made reservations, we arrived on time greeted by a not so friendly hostess. She informed me that she couldn't locate our reservation and suggested we were at a wrong location. I had to pull out my phone to verify their number and showed her that I'd called the day before. She somehow found the reservation after all. We waited another 25 minutes while people were walking in with reservation, being seated. I inquired and was told they had \"reserved seating\". Apparently a reservation here does NOT reserve you a seat, so don't bother! A party of 6 walks in, their reservation is also not located however they're immediately seated - a PARTY OF 6! Once seated, service continued to be slow. 20 mins after being at the table, I finally was able to order a glass of wine. Will not be returning to this location as we were both disappointed."}
{"text":"I booked this restaurant because a family member had raved about it.  What a mistake when there are so many other great restaurants in Scottsdale!  The service and staff were fine but my food was just average and outrageously priced. To begin, we didn't get any bread, and even when we asked our waiter, we never saw that bread basket. I ordered the petit filet, medium rare, with the \"lump crabmeat\".  My steak was medium, dry and bland.  The crabmeat was a joke.  Barely any at all and tasteless. What a huge disappointment My tablemates dinners were fine, so I didn't say anything at the time.  Why send something back and then sit there while everyone else ate their dinners?  As I mentioned previously, with so many fabulous choices for a fine dinner in Scottsdale, I would look elsewhere.  And returning here is not an option."}
{"text":"Very nice evening - we sat at the bar on a Monday evening.  There were 2 bar tenders - guy and gal, neither were very friendly.  It was busy but not slammed and it amazes me that a lot of bartenders don't \"get it\" - we sit at the bar for a reason....to meet other people and to converse with YOU!  Anyway, we'd go back again.  I am a Concierge at a local exclusive resident's club.  I would recommend folks to this restaurant but not as a bar scene."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience here.  The service made us feel welcome and important, the atmosphere was romantic and the menu was impeccable.  I hadn't seen my boyfriend in over a month and we were really glad we made Flemming's our date night."}
{"text":"Came for valentines brunch. Food was great! Service was awful. I plan on going to the other locations in the future. 

First we got seated and the guy didn't pull out our chairs and just handed us the menu. Our server ignored us for 10-15 minutes literally avoiding eye contact. Finally got some water and biscuits. When ordering I asked \"which is better this or..\" Then he cut me off and told me oh yes get that one. Pretty unfriendly and made a big deal about substituting a side. Kind of grabbed the menus and left awkwardly. 

The food came and was very good. The runner kind of threw the plate down and some actually went off the plate and he said \"oh it's slippery\". We kind of laughed it off but still... Everything added up to not be service you expect at a nicer restaurant. 

The waiter started warming up a bit towards the end but still pretty awkward. 

Went to tell the manager on the way out about the rough start and his response was that he'd have to talk to the waiter and get his side of the story. Weird response considering we'd already paid and were walking out. We weren't asking for a refund or anything. I expected a \"sorry for that bad start\" and instead had him say he doesn't believe us. Again very awkward."}
{"text":"Went to the DC Ranch location to celebrate my birthday over the weekend.  I had the Wagu New York Strip with Lobster Mashed Potatoes. It was  one of the best stakes I've had, and I eat many stakes. Great food and great service! They even give you some chocolates in a small box, to take home if it's your birthday!"}
{"text":"*This review is for Happy Hour*

My family and I recently stopped in to Fleming's for happy hour to celebrate my father in law's birthday.  Note there are two happy hours now...from 5-7pm they have $6 cocktail or appetizer offerings (5 selections for $6 til 7) and 8-10pm are $9 appetizers and drinks (8 selections for $9 til 10).  With prices like that, what do you have to lose? We ordered one of everything.

The dishes are on the small side, but the quality is true to what you'd expect at Fleming's, so it was good bang for our buck.  We tried the calamari, carpaccio, butternut squash ravioli, pork belly and burrata.  All of it was delicious, and we got a second serving of the squash and calamari!  A couple of folks in our party tried cocktails and beers too, and they were very well received.  

Tip: Happy hour is served in the bar area only, and it's pretty limited seating.  Arrive early if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"As a business owner I want the best experience for my business clients and colleagues. More importantly when I invite special friends for a fine dining experience I want the best food and service available.  My latest experience, Saturday evening, at Fleming's at the Hilton in Scottsdale was exactly what I expected. The waiter was very attentive and had complete knowledge of the food and wine. The entire staff was always ready to server, the food was fast and delicious. The steaks were perfectly cooked and the wine that was select was exceptional. My friend complement me, on the selection, but it was the waiter who made the suggestion. Well done Fleming's!  My wife and I will be back with friends and clients."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse!!! I have great memories here- when my (then) boyfriend first asked me to be his, Valentine's day, and our anniversary!! We just can't get enough of the exceptional service and quality food. Every server we've had has been great and you can tell management knows how to run a successful business. I have never been less than extremely satisfied. My fiance has a weak stomach and he says the steak here has always been delicious and never has bothered his stomach. I've had everything from salmon to steak and it's all so good!!

ANOTHER GREAT THING about this establishment that I must stress- they always make you feel welcome and a valued customer, always. We are in our mid to late twenties and have been to Mastro's City Hall and Ocean club and every time have been sat in the back corner because they think we look young and will not \"spend enough money.\" We always do and tip accordingly, of course, but that's not the experience I want to have when we're dropping a couple hundred dollars for dinner. At Fleming's we either get one of the big booths in the middle or a table right in the middle. It may sound like something ridiculous to say, but it really does make all the difference for your experience. Fleming's will always have a place in our heart. Thanks for the great memories and even greater food!"}
{"text":"So Good!!  I was there on business staying at the adjacent hotel.  I'm not a meat eater by heart, but can usually find something on any menu.
Even though was there as since, they were kind enough to sit me in a booth in an area off to the side.  
I ordered the Caesar salad. Yum.  Wow....with the fried capers and the perfect amount of dressing and parmesan shavings.  The bread was warm and soft with two delicious butter smears!  They had a \"smaller portions\" entree section which I appreciate.  I ordered the short ribs over mashed potatoes and it was huge!  And very tasty.
I went back the 2nd night and ordered that Ceaser salad again! And tried another entree.
I highly recommend and will even stay in same hotel again next business trip to eat here.  
Prices not horribly high either."}
{"text":"WOW!  What an experience we had here.  Dined with friends and were all blown away by the service from start to finish.  It started with the server approaching us in the bar letting us know she would be our server once we were done with our cocktails and offering to decant some wine ahead of time.  The manager came over to introduce himself too and offered his assistance should we need it.  Once we were seated at our table the drinks kept coming all night and the service was just right, not pushy at all.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and BBQ Shrimp for the table.  Both were outstanding and the shrimp they use are HUGE!  I ordered the larger fillet and others at the table had different cuts of meat and one person ordered the swordfish.  Everyone was very pleased with their entree.  The sides we ordered included the mac-n-cheese which was prepared with Panko breadcrumbs and toasted perfectly.  Overall an outstanding experience and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Flemings never lets me down this is my choice for all my special occasions I've been coming here for over 10 years!!!!!
Went for Father's Day dinner seated right away very attentive Staff including the manager 
We ordered the Father's Day special which by the way was the BEST Bone in Ribeye I've ever had!!!!
 The wedge is always on point,the Mac and cheese is so good that I've adapted the recipe for my own at home REALLY !!!! 
They are the best !!!!High standards and reasonably priced we also ordered the Prime Rib Special it was melt in your mouth delicious!!!!! I will continue to keep my Special family events here...  For over 10 years and I haven't felt like I'm burnt out with Flemings BECAUSE they are forever changing the menu with five star choices and superb dining experiences
Thank you Erica our server she was on point and very attentive hope we get you the next time we visit"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place 7 years ago, moved away, and went back again last night. The service is still efficient and good, however the noise level in the dining area is very high. If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing meal, this is not the place. 

Let's start with the good stuff. The complimentary bread comes out crusty and hot and the flavored spreads were delicious!  The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and arugula with a balsamic dressing was slightly overdressed, but amazing! The little hint of fresh mint in the dressing takes it over the top! The clam chowder was very good. We also had the molten lava cake and creme br√ªl√©e, which were both good, but not exceptional.

Now to the big disappointment. We both had the rib eye steak, medium rare. The seasoning was good, but the outside wasn't crusted or charred enough. The cut of meat was hard to eat with bite after bite of gristle and too much fat. Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).

Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short. Where's the beef?!!"}
{"text":"The pluses:
- Amazing happy hour. Seriously.  The flatbread for a whopping $6 is enough for me for 2 entire meals
- Wine pours are $1 an ounce ($6 or $9 glasses) during happy hour.  YESSSSS!
- Staff: male = hot + friendly, female = probably also attractive (I don't swing thataway) + friendly

The minuses:
- Tons of people (a good sign, but not particularly helpful for me)
- Parking

Side note: the last time I was here, lots of people were trying to use gift cards, probably received from the holidays, during happy hour.  They do NOT take promotional gift cards  (like those purchased at Costco at a discount...) for happy hours or other promotions, so beware.  I don't have a gift card 'cause the happy hour deals are so smoking, I can TOTALLY afford them like a baller!"}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations for our anniversary on a Sunday at 7:15pm.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and we were seated immediately, with our choice of booth or table.  The waitress (a younger girl) was very nice and patient while we decided on drinks and dinner.  She kindly answered all of my questions about the menu and was polite when I still needed another minute to decide.  I ordered the Farmer's Daughter Drink and it was delicious.  (It comes in a martini glass).  At first the waitress' assistant was refilling out water and soda every few minutes (not anywhere near empty even) then by the end of dinner we were waiting for more water.  Not a ding on the restaurant, just weird.

For dinner my husband got the bone in rib-eye medium rare, it was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the Sunday Prime Rib dinner that came with a 12 oz. prime rib with au jus, horseradish sauce, and the peppercorn sauce - (I also requested some bearnaise sauce, no charge), a salad, choice of any full sized side dish, and a full size dessert, all for $38.95.  I chose the Fleming's potatoes and chocolate lava cake.  The potatoes were good, but basically just scalloped potatoes with a hint of jalapeno in them.  The lava cake was delicious, soft and gooey.  My husband ordered the chipotle mac & cheese which was very good, better than the potatoes in our opinion, I just hate spending $9.50 on mac and cheese!  

At the end of our meal the waitress brought a \"gift from the chef\" for our anniversary which was a box of 4 large truffles and a $25 gift card good on your next visit in the dining room only, at this location only."}
{"text":"Wonderful steaks, exceptional service. The wine list is on an iPad! And they give you a choice of black or white napkins! They remember your name, and always treat you like family.

Love coming here, and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I started off with a cocktail - \"Romance\" it reminded me of an adios, but it was sweet and champagne based. 

Had the seafood tower and it was yummy. Moved on to the main course of twin lobster tails. I wasn't thrilled with my lobster tails which seemed to taste like - steamed lobster. But my Mac n cheese, asparagus, and mashed potatoes sides were flavorful. 

My only disappointment rises from when I asked the waitress which she recommended - Lobster en Fuego or Twin lobster tails. She picked the lobster tails and my friend got the Lobster en Fugeo. Her meal was to die for. I had 3 bites and I will never look at lobster tails again. I highly recommend getting the lobster en fuego. It's filled with flavor and so easy and clean to eat. 

We ended with the chocolate lava cake, which was just as appeasing and appetizing as the rest of the meal had been."}
{"text":"We went for the prime rib special the restaurant was running on Sunday. The meal was delicious. We each had a salad, size, dessert and a beautiful piece of prime rib. Service was excellent. The kitchen made some small mistakes; overcooked onion rings and some creme brule served in a cracked bowl. All of which was caught by our serving team who immediately removed it before it was placed on our table. Great food just wish the room was better at handling all the chatter as it was hard to hear the people we were with or hold a conversation. Loved the carrot cake!
Got a call on way home from waiter saying that the charge info was thrown away and they needed the charge info again to bill card. We gave them the info. Surprise today as we were billed twice for our dinner last night. Waiting now on callback from manager."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with Flemings. Very romantic, and dark inside. You get what you pay for, and here, you pay ALOT. Portions are small, but thats kind of a good thing if you ask me. Service is top notch and so is flavor. Came with my mom & we both had the Restaurant week specials. I went with the Chicken & Mom got the Steak.  Both were incredible. 
My only regret was not getting the Chocolate Lava cake. This is a must at Flemings- Deelish!"}
{"text":"Okay so normally I don't leave many reviews unless I want to warn people not to go somewhere but I was just reading through these reviews and was surprised to see 1 star reviews due to customer service and being judged because of the way a person looks or dress. Now I've been to this location numerous times but granted I did dress in a long sleeve express shirt, jeans and a pair of buckle dress shoes. Not the nicest outfit compare to what people said that if you didn't have a suit on then you didn't get service but I decided to put it to the ultimate test and by the way every man should own 1 nice outfit at least but that is besides the point so here is what I did. 

I decided to go as casual as I could. I literally wore a pair of dark grey slack shorts, with a Hurley shirt and pair of old school D.C. Shoes. Now take into consideration I\"m covered in tattoos as well. I had nothing nice on and even wore my ever day citizen watch which I bought at Costco for 250 bucks along with my hundred dollar gift card for 80 bucks which is always a must if you going to Fleming's. Now we went on Sunday for the Prime Rib special and only drank WATER besides a Heineken I ordered after already sitting the second time my waitress came by. Now I keep track of how many times our waitress and her helpers check on us and after 12 times I decided to stop counting. We never had an empty glass of WATER, we never didn't have service, food or anything else we needed. At one point my glass almost got half way empty before it was filled up. Our waitress was amazing and knew the menu back and forth and also was kind enough to suggest any specials they were offering. The manager on hand came by to make sure our meal was to our expectations and stayed to chat with us for a while. 

When our meal was done our waitress had our extra food bagged and it was not because it was a slow nice. Every table in the main dining area was full and she had her hands full. The service and food was amazing and if you looking for a nice night out and an amazing steak with specials almost all the time and a casual atmosphere then Fleming's is a place for you. Out the door for 3 Prime Rib Specials that included a soup or salad, a side (which for an extra 8 dollars we upgraded to the lobster mash potatoes which were amazing and would recommend doing if they are serving it) a big Prime Rib and dessert for 39.99, plus coffee & beer we only paid $146.00 and of course left 190.00 for the superb service. If you going somewhere nice it's just part of eating. Tip your servers if they work their butts off. Was a great night out with my mom and girl and will be back again soon. Thanks Fleming's."}
{"text":"This is a good \"old school\" steakhouse that you would expect to find in any major city like Chicago or New York.  Lots of dark wood paneling, exposed stainless kitchen, linen tablecloths, attentive staff and a little pricey.  Similar to Capitol Grill or Ruth Chris.  I think it's the same group that owns P.F. Changs.

I took some friends there last night and everybody had good food and good service.  Noise can be a factor here as an adjacent large table, filled with large people with large voices were something of an irritation.  Sound seems to ricochet off of all restaurant surfaces.  Flemings is really proud of their wine list with prices to match.  Wine and several side dishes will add another $ to the price range.  You can easily have a five star night and probably wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Flemings, they really stepped up their game and service.  I actually have eaten here couple of years ago and it really didn't leave me with a positive experience.  I felt places like Flemings and The Keg were not quite a top end steak house, but  just a step up from a Longhorns or Outback, boy I was completely wrong.

We ended up choosing Flemings cause my wonderful sister and brother in law got me a gift card to this place.  So we ended up coming here for my birthday on 12/26 for dinner.  We made a reservation for 7:30 and were seated right away.  The food, service, and ambience was all top notch.  Everything was great and I appreciate the great service.

We ordered the sweet chile calamari for appetizer and double thick pork chop and king crab for our dinners.  The server brought out two lobster tails at first, but I let him know I ordered the king crab, so we had a little hiccup, but the manager was nice enough to give us a 25 gift card for the mistake.  I let her know it was ok, just a simple mistake.  I don't blame the waiter, he seemed extremely busy and he really did a great job.  That's outstanding customer service!  Our drinks were constantly refilled and the service team did a great job checking up on us.

Overall, pretty solid experience.  A week later we ended up going to Dominicks for dinner, and I must say it was on the same level as that, (check out my later review).        We will be adding Fleming's to our list and will be coming back. I know Sundays they do a good prime rib dinner I've been hearing about, so I'm anxious to use our gift card and sample it. Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE from the minute you make the reservation until the day after with a thank you email. Food just as good.  Word of caution it is expensive but I have no problem paying for excellent food and service. Way to go Flemings team. We'll be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is receiving two stars for several reasons. First, they were seating reservations 45-55 minutes late. Why bother accepting reservations if you don't actually hold tables for them? When people have reservations, they want to be seated promptly. If a restaurant is unable to accommodate fast seating, then they are better off not accepting reservations at all.  At least people would know to expect a wait.

One hostess was personable and calming.  The other, with glasses, was terrible. She was patronizing to customers and quite rude in general.

The waiter we had was decent, nothing special and not personal. The gentleman filling water was very good - fast and attentive.

The food was nothing to write home about, albeit, we are vegetarian. Typically, steakhouses will offer vegetarian options that aren't on the menu. Fleming's did as well, but it was a compilation of their side dishes and appetizers. 

One star for the berries and cream for dessert. 

We only visited Fleming's because we had an AMEX promotion for $40 off, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Charge the high prices but please .... can your Server Kristen not be On another planet?
I'm hoping she was either high or recovering from a night out, because if that is really her work ethic....
She's need a job at Burger King, not a five star restaurant.....If she has a disability...I truely apologize. Baring that, please let this girl move on to another service industry.
Food was terrific, service was horrifying.
My husband and I each ordered a glass of wine, she brought one glass and served it to our Son.
Ordered Lobster Tails, she never came back & checked on us so I received drawn butter with 2 bites to go.  I assume the \"Manager\" came to ask us how our meal was....I had to ask her for another glass of wine for my husband & myself, she brought it to us....Still have not see our Server Kristen.  
Did not leave our normal 20%+
Hopefully Kristen will get the drift....
Overly Priced
Poor Service
Everything is Ala-Cart so expect, like
      Us a 300.00 tab if you actually want 
      A full meal, God help you if you want
      A salad !! Hold on to your Wallet!
Better choices all around the area, let this one go!"}
{"text":"I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I think a solid 3.5 not quite a 4 star experience but nothing atrocious. My partner started with the French onion soup that he said had a good flavor. I decided to get my appetizer with my meal and just enjoy my cocktail. Service in the bar was very good sometimes it can be hit or miss. I got the prime burger not very original but I was in the mood, burger was just fine cooked a little more than medium as requested but it wasn't an issue for me, fries of course delicious. I could not go to Fleming's and just get a burger so I ordered the crab cake appetizer to accompany my meal. Good crab cakes for in the middle of the desert so I can't complain. My partner got the double breast of chicken with white wine mushroom thyme and leek sauce. He said the pieces of chicken were good but the sauce was eh. Definitely will be back at one location or another."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse overall.

Tip for those not familiar with Scottsdale - this Flemings is located in the Hilton hotel on Scottsdale Ave.  The address isn't really on the building, so it may not be super easy to find if you're just looking for the address.

I had the boneless rib eye.   I ordered it medium rare, but it was probably closer to medium, but still very flavorful, tender, and juicy.  They season only with salt and pepper to really let the true beef flavor come through.  This reminded me of the rib eye at Delmonico's (Emeril Lagasse's restaurant) inside Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, which is also an excellent steak house.

My girlfriend got the fillet mignon (medium plus) with stuffed flounder.  Maybe because the fillet was medium plus, I really couldn't appreciate it as much.  The flounder was excellent.

Everything is a la carte, so it can get kind of pricey.  We got the lobster chowder (one of the best I've had), creamed corn (very good), sauteed spinach (excellent alternative to creamed spinach, surprisingly very good), and chocolate lava souffle for dessert (which is a must).

The bread is also really good.  I know you don't go to a steakhouse for the bread, but I can appreciate good, fresh bread with good butter.

For the 2 of us, it was $160 including the tip (and no alcohol).

Overall, a great dining experience with excellent steaks."}
{"text":"The evening started off as a 2.5 star experience. We had a reservation (which I recommend if you are planning on going on a weekend night) but we wanted to get there early for happy hour.  The bar was packed as was to be expected but we were able to find a ledge with chairs at it. The bf went to the bar to order and a large, loud bartender took the order and rudely asked \"where are you even seated?\" The bf pointed to our perch and the bartender replies \" uh,  we have servers who are taking care of tables. They're a little busy right now but someone will come around!\" Ok sorry jerk no need to scold us. We had no idea there was a server or we would have just waited for one instead of inconveniencing you! Anyway, the server comes, we tell her what we ordered, asked her to keep the tab open and ordered a Sweet Chili Calamari. She comes back a few minutes later with our credit card receipt already run and no calamari on it. We finished the round and I flagged her down again. I ordered another round and asked if she put our order in for the calamari. She had not and seemed put out that  we had to reopen the  tab even when we specifically told her to keep it open. The place was pretty chaotic. The hour we were at the bar we were brought another table's food twice and staff were running everywhere.  This is were they start to increase in stars. The calamari was some of the best I've ever eaten. The sauce wasn't too sweet, the peppers were pickled and not too hot and the batter was light and airy. We were seated at a very large booth and were greeted by a very friendly and down to earth server, Nicole I think. The wine selection is very good and they have a variety of prices which is nice. You can order 100 by the glass but there were some very good bottles in the $35-$40 range. The BF had the peppercorn NY strip, I had the bone in ribeye, and we shared the half and half (frites and onion rings) and asparagus. I've been to Del Frisco's in Manhattan. The steak I had there was seriously THE BEST thing I have ever put in my mouth! It is the steak that all other steaks have to live up to. My ribeye was almost as good and $20 cheaper, every time I think about it my mouth starts to water. The BF enjoyed his just as much and randomly brings it up, apparently his is haunting him as well. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and well marbled. The sides were more than enough for the 2 of us, but being the gluttons that we are, we ate everything but 1 lonely onion ring. The service was on point. She came by at the exact moments that we needed her but left us alone the rest of the time. Total bill including the bar tab was about $200, which I think is reasonable for the amount and quality of what we had. We had several cocktails, an appetizer, 2 large, succulent steaks, 2 sides, and a bottle of Malbec. There are so many other steak houses that we want to try in the area that I don't think we'll go back but it is definitely an experience I will tell all my friends about! *obviously*"}
{"text":"Just about as good as a steak house can get, this place would be right at home in NY, Chicago or even DC.  First and foremost, excellent meat.  All the other goodies that go into making a good steak into a great steak house experience were there too.  Nice decor, open an dinviting.  Great service.  Huge wine list with options from budget to Bill Gates.  Creamed spinach and chocolate lava cake.  All good things.  Suprisingly, its a chain.  There is another in Tucson that is just as good."}
{"text":"The best caesar salad i have ever had.

The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak.

The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! Spendy but not at happy hour."}
{"text":"It was a well-priced happy hour for an upscale place, but I found the offerings to be quite limited. Burger was just okay, salt & pepper shrimp was accompanied by green bean fries, but they were all covered in the same soggy batter."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Fleming's. We were there to celebrate my birthday, and started the night early for happy hour. The happy hour offerings are impressive, with the appetizers being a decent size and a nice selection of cocktails and wines. Seating is somewhat limited, so get there early. 
We transitioned to the dining room, where the server was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a salad since I was a bit full from happy hour, and my husband ordered a steak. He requested it pepper crusted, and they were able to prepare it this way even though it wasn't something they offered.
The dessert was delicious, and we were given handmade truffles on our way out. 

Bottom Line: Great food and service. We will be back for a special occasion, or to take advantage of the great happy hour."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my entree. Notified waiter who didn't say too much, quiet apology.  Later manager came over as usual to see how everything was. He didn't mention anything, no apologies...nada. Didn't take it off the bill either.   Not classy way to handle. Food was good"}
{"text":"Bone in ribeye very poor quality and overcooked     Poor example of a Flemings 
Server did a good job   Manager was poor at his job 

I Would recommend any other steak house"}
{"text":"This was my first trip into Fleming's. My husband and I were blown away by the service we received. Thank you Nicole and management. We had an excellent experience and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day with my wife - this was our second trip to this particular location.  Our service was great - the manager stopped over a few times to make sure everything was going well.  Very large wine menu, which my wife liked, beer options were a little skimpy (wish there were more local crafts to choose from).  We particularly liked the cheese spread for the bread and heard the couple behind us commenting on it as well.

The steaks, as always, were top-notch.  This is one steak you don't want/need to add any A1 sauce to, or anything else for that matter.  We both had NY strips...one of the best steaks I've had anywhere.  Cooked perfectly (as it should be, for the price).  As this is an a la carte ordering process, we ordered a side of asparagus, which was tasty as well.  The clam chowder I had before the meal was a hearty sized serving, and we finished off the meal with some carrot cake.  All in all, a great meal in a classy atmosphere.  

Looks like they have a prime rib special on Sundays that we are anxious to try."}
{"text":"My husbands boss was in town and wanted to take some of his employees out to a nice swanky dinner. he made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a Friday night. we get there and our table is ready to go! Our server Javier was very polite, I would say he could have been more attentive but they were busy and it was a large place. 
Any way, I ordered a Mojito, it was just ok. You would think for the price it would have been the best Mojito I have ever tasted. There was to much Mint and not enough anything else. It looked as though a forest was growing out of my glass. I love Mojitos and this one was by far the worst I had ever had. no appetizer because we are on a time constraint we have tickets to a show right after dinner so we hop right into ordering the main course. I ordered the Prime Ribeye, for 43.00 you would think it would be all meat right?!? nope not so much, a good 2 inches of my ribeye was pure solid fat, (not the edible kind) I was pretty upset and you would also think that for the price it would come with a side.. yep think again. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes (9.00) for a quarter of a cup of potatoes. I have to admit they were DELICIOUS! but not $9.00 for a quarter of a cup delicious. My husband ordered the Scallops. and thats just what he got, 5 scallops on a huge plate that had so much paprika on them they were red.  I myself never understand spending so much money on so little food but hey if that's what you enjoy doing where you have to hit up the drive thru on the way home because your still hungry I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Flemings last night and considered it extraordinarily good value, as they happened to have  on offer a $34.95 prix fixe special:  8oz filet,  8oz lobster tail, soupe l'oignon gratinee, and French green beans:   for $35,  in a high end steak house! Wow!    My wife had that, and I ordered ala carte:  the bone-in rib eye [$47.50], the house jalape√±o cheddar scalloped potatoes, and creamed spinach.  Once I tasted my wife's simply spectacular onion soup, I ordered that, too. I had ~ $75 of food and my wife's was prix fixe was only $35.  What value!  You can bet we will watch the website and return often when they have these specials.

For twelve years I lived in, and ate my way on expense account through, Europe [London, Paris, Munich, Frankfurt, Vienna, Rome, Milan, Budapest, Zurich, Geneva], and am a Les Cordon Blue schooled amateur cook.  I am a demanding diner.

The meat - ordered rare plus, was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  The green beans were similarly perfectly prepared.  The potato dish is an absolute killer.  The creamed spinach was excellent but could use much more garlic [personal taste, perhaps], which I am sure one could request.  The portions of the sides were easily large enough for two plus hungry diners and we took some home.  

And, oh, the \"French Onion Soup\".  I called it above \"soupe l'oignon gratinee\" not to be pretentious but to emphasize that this is the real deal.  It is very hard to find the real thing in the U.S., but THIS IS IT.  The bread used is the usual failing in the US, but this was perfect, as was  the imported gruyere.  Simply outstanding and as good as I have had anywhere.

Service was excellent.  My only complaint was when my wife said she'd like a glass of Chardonnay, the waiter immediately suggested the one that is $21 per glass.  This is one standard of Ocean Club that Flemings should scotch, unless, of course, the waiter says \"i recommend the XXX at $21 a glass\".  It is really annoying."}
{"text":"For my daughters 21st Birthday we decided to take the family to Flemings and DC Ranch.  We drive by this restaurant on a daily basis and yet have never given them a chance so I never knew what we were missing until now.  The atmosphere is very nice they have a bar area with TV's if you just in for an informal high quality steak and outstanding cocktails.  The service was simply outstanding we were treated like royalty and when one of the steaks delivered to the table we just a little overcooked they brought out the chef and insisted we allow them to make another.  Best part is they let us keep the mistake - thats nice when your talking a $50.00 piece of prime beef.  The ribeyes are amazing - ask for the ribeye that they bring to the table and cut off the bone for you WOW.  The wine selection was among the best in Scottsdale and the cocktails a perfect blend.  Thank you Flemmings for your fine contribution to my daughters 21st."}
{"text":"Dinner at Flemings on Tuesday night.  Hubby loves the Scottish Salmon and I didn't know what I was going to have since I don't eat fish. I finally decided on the Free Range Lemon Rosemary Brick Chicken in its juices with Spinach gnocchi.  We also had mashed potatoes and string beans.  Had  the salad which was nicely dressed for me and sans dressing for my disciplined man.  
The Scottish salmon satisfied hubby along with the delicious string beans and they were indeed delicious.  The mashed potatoes were kind of average--don't know if they are from a mix or not since they did not taste like REAL mashed potatoes.  My chicken arrived like it had been trying to swim across Guantanamo bay and was still soaked from the trip.  What was supposed to be pan juices turned out to be about 2 and a half inches of broth--with white wine in it.  It almost covered both pieces of chicken (portion was more than adequate).  Floating in the broth were the gnocchi.  Tasted one and didn't like it then had hubby taste them to check my palate.  He neatly took his napkin and put it on his mouth and out went the gnocchi.  So I was not wrong.  Gnocchi are supposed to be pillows of delicious potato flour heaven in a  red sauce or any other liquid you want these babies to live in.  Not the case here.  I don't know how people eat them.  Or do they?  The chicken which had to be pulled \"out of the Guantanamo waters\" had little or no salt.  Ergo, little or no flavor.  Seasoning is everything and I know that the \"chefs\" at Flemings must know this.  Are they catering to the high blood pressure crowd of which I am not one?   I offered my dinner to hubby who despite his propensity to be able to \"clean up a plate\", decided he was not eating it after taking one taste of it.  So there you have it.  No dinner for me until I get home and have some Product 19 cereal with milk since I have no plans to start dinner.  
The cereal was good and for those of you who have never tried Product 19 it really is good not to mention all the added vitamins and minerals.  
Eating cereal was not what I intended when I went to dinner at Flemings.  You always expect high quality when you go to these steakhouses.  This one let me down."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by recognizing the wonderful staff at this resturant. From the first moment you walk in until you leave, the staff is inviting,  friendly, and courteous. The dry-aged RibEye steak was cooked to perfection and was very tender. However, my host did not serve me, and there was no knife on the table to cut into this delicable slice of beef. Luckily, a passing host saw my situation and immediately came to my rescue, delivering the necessary utensil to spear this steak. The dessert was very tasty but the crust was unusually hard. I accompanied my dessert with a glass of Sambuca. I requested Sambuca black but all they had was the clear version. Traditionally this should be served with three coffee beans, but only arrived with two. 
Overall, the staff and steak made up for some of these shortcomings, but this establishment is still well worth the visit. You won't be disappointed.
Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"We dined in on Tuesday night and didn't quite have the experience we expected. Service was extremely slow, which was odd because it seemed like a slow Tuesday night. It Took about 15 minutes plusto get our drinks, and 10 minutes between each visit from our waiter. It was so bad that I ordered something else because I didn't want to waste time asking allergy questions about the dish I wanted (server didn't seem to have much knowledge of the menu so it would have taken him time to find out). Of course, our food took forever to come out because there was a very large party ahead of us. However, the food was very good. I got the sea bass and my husband got a filet. The Flemings salad was amazing. The only reason I give a three stars is based on food. Service was 0, especially for a \"fine dining experience\"."}
{"text":"The review is for happy hour only.

Loved happy hour at this restaurant!  Had to get there right at 5pm to get a table on a Friday night, but thankfully we were seated right away.  We partook in the excellent drink specials and both had a nice big glass of wine, which was quite tasty.  We shared the BBQ shrimp, pork belly, and a burger.  The BBQ shrimp was the highlight.  It had an awesome sauce and was great for dunking bread/chips.  The pork belly was pretty good... not amazing though.  The burger was also great... we loved the fries it came with.  They had some lemon and garlic on them, which was a nice touch.

Service was great and the vibe in the bar was nice for a Friday night.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"expensive but excellent quality food, service and presentation. The main room can get a little noisy so ask for a table in the back if a more intimate setting is preferred."}
{"text":"Great location, right next to Hilton Resort on the SEC of Scottsdale Rd. & Lincoln Dr. in Scottsdale. This location is much smaller than the other locations, and the noise level was actually too loud for me as this is a very special celebration for me and my date.  Both my date and I ordered the Bone-In Rib Eye steaks.  The steaks were very juicy and moist and it turned out perfect and it melted in your mouth.

Our waiter was Justin and he and his assistant were both very helpful answering our questions as this was our first time visiting this location.  We had to shout out loud to get our waiters' attention due to the noises surrounding our table. Once we finished with our meal, one of the manager, Tracy, stopped by our table to make sure their services meets our standard.

But overall, this was a great choice on both of our parts and we'll definitely return to this place again soon for another celebration."}
{"text":"My wife and I look for a place in our area DC Ranch to nosh at.  We often overlook Flemings and their happy hour menu.
We3 went there last night.  The service the speed the food were all top notch.  We ordered the cheese burger. and the prime rib dip and cocktails.
The Happy Hour menu is top notch and reasonable when you are on the run."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough good things about this place! First - the bar is awesome and always packed so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table/seat at the bar. The hh is amazing and goes til 7 which makes it even better. Most of the time I just stay and eat in the bar because the hh food is just as good as the other stuff! 

We actually did go eat in the dining room though to have a bit more formal dinner. We split the filet, mushrooms, and shrimp appetizer. Everything was fabulous and the service was even better. Really can't say enough good things about this location!"}
{"text":"No matter where i sit or who i dine with Flemings is  a true favorite
Weather it be a solo dinner or a special evening i always find something i enjoy,
The past week i went, i enjoyed a wonderfull johnny walker blue, and the flemings ceaser as well as the small bites sliced fillet serve over mushroom risoto
The bartenders were fantastic nice pours and great conversation 
This place is a must try"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town! $6 burgers (cooked the way YOU order them, I prefer med rare) seared ahi salad, carpaccio, bbq shrimp etc. AND $6 cocktails and wine! You cannot beat the quality for the price for happy hour, must sit in the bar or patio however. Steak and sides are all delicious! LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"If I can only give 0 stars on yelp I would on this one. I can say I've been to many Fleming's before but this one in particular I had the most horrible experience ever. 
Service guy (Alex) was MIA never checked on us and the food was crap and kept apologizing all night for it. 

Drove with my family from Cali to Phoenix and was staying at the Hilton's next door so we decided to swing by and eat there for the night and what a mistake that was. 

It started with the bread, they brought it twice and it was returned twice for being so hard and inedible.
Steak was burnt, the fries were still raw and incredibly oily, the mushrooms were watery, no flavor and over cooked... nothing was right. Not sure if the chef had a brain fart or was rushing to get home that night but he definitely made it a unmemorable experience for us.  Going to Denny's would have been better.

To cap it all off they charged me $70 for the steak and a measly Caesar salad.WOW payed the bill and left extremely annoyed.  

Will never go back there or to any other Fleming's ever again. I guess this chain is going down hill.

{"text":"I love this place and the service was great!  RUTHS CHRIS and Morton's Flemings is really catching up!!

Best atmosphere and best service EVER!!!"}
{"text":"No star.. Were waiting for our dinner for more than an hour....terrible service..we decided to walked out the door. Im not going back here..

Front desk did not even say nothing nor apologize to the lousy service ...i did not have problems to the pima branch."}
{"text":"From the minute we entered the restaurant, had a drink at a Beautiful, Relaxing bar, friendly waiters; we Loved the place. Had our fave booth, the Prime Rib for 2 for $60, included salad, side and dessert BEST DEAL in town and BEST Dinner we have had in a long time. We have been here at least 20 times.... but we usually get a $25.00 Gift Card. . 
We will return soon~!!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty different place depending on whether you go for Happy Hour or Dinner, but both deserve 4 stars.

This is easily one of the best happy hours we've been to in the Scottsdale area.  I've been there twice and both times there has been a wait.  I wish you could make reservations for the bar area for Happy Hour, but unfortunately that isn't possible.

Here's why the Happy Hour is so busy:
The service is outstanding, as are the deals.
The burger is incredible ... for $7 I don't think you can do better.  Just don't get the onion rings ... it literally only came with 2 of them.

The drinks were strong and delicious.  $3 for a beer and $6 for specialty cocktails.  The Baked Brie and the Pork Belly appetizers were amazing.

As for dinner, everything was pretty delicious.  Both steaks were very good, but mine had far too much seasoning.  

We didn't like our server because she seemed to be pretty pushy in terms of upselling, but she could have been having a bad day.  We also thought it was odd how often we saw the hostesses walking around checking on table progress.  Usually at such a nice restaurant, they're not as concerned with table turnover.

it was pretty darn expensive overall, but that's to be expected with a steakhouse. 

Overall, I would recommend Fleming's more for Happy Hour than dinner, but both are great.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great steaks, but extremely pricey so bring your checkbook.

We had $100 in gift cards to Fleming's so after visiting the Scottsdale Art Walk recently we decided to stop in for dinner. The food was delicious, but like all upscale steak houses, everything is a-la carte. Steaks are $50 and up and your sides start at $12 and go up from there. We started with an appetizer of calamari, then I had a bone-in ribeye and my wife had the New York strip. For sides we had the brussel sprouts and bacon and the lobster mashed potatoes. Because it was a Thursday night, my wife stuck with water and I had one IPA. I will say that everything was delicious and very well prepared and the service was excellent.

However, the whole setting was very generic. Fleming's is locally owned, but if you'd blindfolded me I couldn't have told you if I was in a Morton's, Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille. Even the beer selection was generic. Yes, they carry a lot of wine, but how about offering some local craft beer as well? My IPA was a Sam Adams Rebel which is decent, but something I could find anywhere.

I also take issue with how much they charge just to cook a piece of meat. Yes, I realize that's how steakhouses work, but when I'm paying that much for food I like to know that the chef actually worked to put ingredients together.

So how much was it? Well after tip our $100 gift cards barely covered half of the bill. I can't even imagine what it would be if we had ordered more drinks or a bottle of wine.

Sure, this is a great place if you're on an expense account or just want something generic, but I also appreciate the experience so next time I want a steak I'll choose Durant's or The Stockyards."}
{"text":"We frequent Flemings alot and have since they first opened.  We have ordered a variety of foods and everytime it is perfectly cooked.  The service we receive is outstanding. We have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seated.  We haven't ever had any problems with the food or service.
I think that this is a five star restaurat."}
{"text":"We ate at the Flemings on Pima Road on June 19, 2015.  Simply stated, the experience was outstanding.  Our waiter, Jose, was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, but not an overbearing presence.  The rest of the wait service was also very good.  The food was cooked to perfection.  The Strip steak that I had was one of the best, if not the best, I have ever had (and yes, I have eaten at Durant's).  I had mine done medium rare and seared while my son had his Strip steak medium rare and broiled.  My wife had the small Filet done medium rare.  Both stated that their food was equally as good as mine.  

Do not expect a fast paced meal.  One of the pleasures is that it was served at a leisurely pace allowing for the total enjoyment of what was being served.  We had drinks, the entr√©es, and we shared a wonderful fruit and cream dessert and we where there for over 90 minutes.  The environment was subdued and reasonably quiet.  The other guests' conversations did not intrude upon ours.  

All the employees, from the manager (who came to our table after we had told Jose how much we enjoyed our meal and service) to the greeter who open the door for us were friendly and seemed genuinely pleased that we had decided to visit their establishment.  One of the assistant manager even took my wife's arm and helped her to the restrooms when asked where they were.  Could not have asked for more."}
{"text":"Fleming's has great steakhouse service. Attentive, friendly and gracious. Always sit at the bar and enjoy all aspects of a great happy hour or full service dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible service- terrible food.  My son's took 1 bite of his chicken and stopped there.  
The waitress never asked if there was something wrong or of he wanted anything else.  
We spent $135- on an awful meal.  We will never return"}
{"text":"I used to love this place since my Mother lives close by we'd go here when I'd come visit her.  When I opened the menu and saw the prices I thought I was going to need the Heimlich maneuver.  They dramatically raised the prices since my last visit.  WAY OVER PRICED!   My girl friend and I shared a wedge salad and that was very good.  I also had the clam chowder that should have been called corn chowder.  The soup hardly had any clams and priced at $12.00 was worth $5.00 at the most, $4.00 would be fair.  My entree was the petite filet.  I ordered it medium rare and though it was cooked about right it was very dry for a $40.00 little piece of meat.  One of our friends steak was under cooked.  They took it back to fix the problem.  We were all done eating by the time she finally got her steak back over cooked.  They told her they wouldn't charge her for the steak and gave her a $25.00 gift card for her next visit.  She'll end up giving away the gift card since she said she won't be back.  When we got the bill they still charge us for all of the steaks and no credit was given on my friends over cooked steak.  We had the Costco gift cards and the bill was still very high.  Expect to throw down at least $100.00/ person.  I gave them an extra star since The Sunday prime rib special may still be a good deal."}
{"text":"The best Happy Hour in Town...Darrin, Frank, Abe, Julie are the best"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Went on this occassion with a gf for hh and just the best experience (not there has ever been a bad one).  The hostess sat us on the patio promptly and we were immediately greeted by our server, who also happened to be VERY handsome.  

We had the best service all night, very attentive and as good as it gets. 

The food, as always, top notch.  Great portion sizes and quality.  We shared the mushroom ravioli, prawns and cheeseburger and all were to die for. I think my favorite were the prawns, great size and spicy amazingness. 

Overall, doesn't get better and for the HH prices, it's icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Every bite was delectable. This place also has top customer service. What a wonderful place for date night with my husband. Calamari was lemony and tender. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and the best flavor. Our carrot cake came with a side bowl of fresh whipped cream. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Pricing has gone up and portion size down. Service is slow and not as friendly. On special days they would give chocolates at the end.  No longer...I think they are cutting back - in areas that used to be a reason to choose Flemings over other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Too bad the service is so terrible, I generally love the food. We went to sit down at a table in the bar (that the host told us to sit at) and the host asked us to please wait until they cleaned the table. No problem, but as we waited the waitress \"gave\"  our table away to someone else. The wait staff and the host stand all argued with us and the other patrons. Embarrassing for them, as the manager stood by and just looked the other way. We went to BLT Steak instead. Delicious meal there! I recommend you go there instead."}
{"text":"This was a disaster from the beginning. I ordered Chilean sea bass it came back rare then they sent it back and cooked a new one for me and that came back raw. Finally they made a steak for us and they sent us the wrong steak. We were there for over two hours and didn't eat a thing. We were so disgusted by the lack of Service that we will never go there again. Not only that they change their onion rings, the new onion rings they make our awful. I would've liked to have their original onion rings.at the end of our over two hours sitting, the manager came by and calm the entire meal."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing.  The fresh warm bread, and the butters for the bread, the steak, the potatoes, the chocolate lave desert, were all wonderful.  Our son drove up form UA and wasn't thinking about what he wore.  They kindly made an exception this time, and in the future he will dress more appropriately. We and he appreciated that immensely."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Fleming's a number of times.The food is pretty good , but the service has sucked each time. We mentioned to the manager, whom was not very sincere with his response. Next time Eddie V's"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. 

First, the Good or let me say the Great! Happy Hour menu only in the bar is awesome! Burger was big and tasty! Cheap drinks and apps great combo! You may have to fight for a seat but its well worth it!

Second, the Bad. On a seperate occasion, specifically Valentines weekend, my wife and I visited and ate in the main room. Service was excellent. Too many servers actually. Then you have another manager asking if things were okay - it got a little creepy and overbearing. However, they were super nice and attentive. 

The steaks were good, not great, but good and at those prices the steaks have to be great, anything less is a disappointment. 

Anyway, we sat next to the Parkers and Sons guy who was at a table of four. They were nice enough but his wife/girlfriend? actually took OFF her shoes and was rubbing her bare cracked old feet at the table! That was nasty and did not make the meal any better. Now that is not Flemings fault but, with all these waiters and managers running around - I can believe somebody didn't says something! Maybe they were just as stunned as us. It was a bit too casual for fine dining for our taste...

Anyway, pretty good overall but, I would recommend saving some cash and just go for the happy hour...."}
{"text":"Went to Fleming's during the latest restaurant week, since it's the best deal of the year. Hadn't been to this location before, but a great experience. Service was perfect as were the steaks, salmon, salad, sides. We will return without a doubt."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse by far, and I've been to many. Always great service and have never had any problems with food. Amazing steak, good prices for such amazing meat. My mouth is watering writing this review thinking about my last experience. I had the pepper new york strip and wow it was amazing, perfectly cooked! Can't wait to take someone here on a date!"}
{"text":"We had the best server... name was Scott.

I ordered the prime rib after swallowing our appetizer, the shrimp  (forgot the official name...!) and it was delish!

If you're looking for a well-made dirty martini, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This restaurant redeemed itself tonight.  My last visit was not quite a disaster but close.
I was by myself tonight with a 5:30 reservation.  Wasn't excited about being seated in a small back room but probably would have been reseated if I'd asked.
I started out with a Macallan 12.  Don't think I've ever been charged over $20 for one but it was a reasonable pour.
Calamari for an appetizer.  Cooked perfectly and could have easily been shared.
The wedge salad had plenty of good blue cheese.  I don't think it mentioned the type of lettuce but it wasn't a crispy iceberg like most.
My strip steak was closer to medium than the medium-rare I asked for but it was a delicious piece of meat.  Very flavorful and more tender than a strip usually is.
Loaded baked potato was done just right.  It too would have been plenty to share.
The table assistants were really in the ball.  My server, not quite as attentive as I'd expect at a restaurant in this price range ($120.00).
Overall I'd give tonight's dinner a 9 on food and an 8 on service.  Huge improvement over my last visit."}
{"text":"In the words of Monty Python, \"Run away! Run away!\" We have had several lovely meals at the DC Ranch location, so we tried this newly renovated spot, which turned out to be a horrid mistake. By the end of the meal we were debating whether it was our worst expensive meal ever. Here's what you get for $200/couple: It started when we were seated 20 mins late for our reservation - the hostess sounded genuinely perplexed that 'people are taking  longer than I expected.' (Hint: it's not your guests, it's your abysmal service.) Then we waited 35 minutes for first course, the squash ravioli, which was just OK (we were sharing it, but got no plates -- several waitstaff watched as we leaned over the table trying not to drip sauce all over). Then it was another 15 min wait until our spinach salad came (which was good). By now my wine glass was empty, and it would remain that way for the rest of the night without any offer for another. We had another 30 minute wait for our main course to arrive, which would have been more at home in an Outback Steak House and not even remotely worth the $50 price of admission -- my steak was undercooked, my wife's was overcooked. They weren't very tender or flavorful (mostly just over-salted). We ordered two sauces, and they brought the only one we DIDN'T ask for. The Fleming's potatoes, which I always love at the DC Ranch location, were mediocre here. The asparagus was cooked well but incredibly salty.

We also were treated to a show at neighbor's table as they sent back their steaks, and then received a shower of lobster bits as their server cracked open the shell (like a crustaceous IED). They did not look like they were enjoying their splurge meal.

The horrendous service and mediocre food would be disappointing even for a $50 meal. For a $200 meal it is outrageous. Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Would've been a 5 star but we had an 8 o'clock reservation and at about 8:15 we were offered a seat on the patio or to continue to wait for a table to free up. However, our server, Jason, was attentive and very personable. The patio turned out to be just fine, surprised that more people didn't sit out there. The food was excellent, I got the filet mignon chef special and it was perfection. They also surprised our friend with a small gift as we were celebrating his bachelor party. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend it for anyone in search of an elegant place to enjoy a steak. The lobster mac and cheese was also done very well and would recommend that as well."}
{"text":"Went there for a special famil dinner tonight & it was horrible!  Service was terrible, food was cold, sides gasped no flavor, and the prime rib was the worst I have had.  Had a lot of food leftover & waiter took it to box up for us.  He brought back one bag & told us it was just the sides & the meat would be coming out soon.  When we got the bill I asked for our meat - he came back with another bag & when we got home realized he gave us someone else's food.  We will never dine there again."}
{"text":"Brought my dad here, while visiting, for a belated Father's Day celebration. I took heed of the chandler location reviews and went to Scottsdale. It didn't disappoint!! The food was AMAZING! Steaks cooked and seasoned perfectly, sides delicious! Deserts to die for!!! Service was perfect! Attentive enough without being too overbearing. Only complaint was the bread was too toasted. Prefer warm but not crunchy. As always, Flemings did not disappoint and my husband and I are already fantasizing about our next Flemings dinner!!! I find it way better than their competitor...the one that serves steaks on a 500 degree plate!!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Went for a celebration dinner with my two kids.  we've been to Flemings in Peoria a number of times and always loved it. This experience was far from that.  Service was snooty and slow.  Took forever to get anyone to pay attention.  We ordered two kids meals and I had the petite filet, which, for $36, was so petite I left starving. I presented a $25 pre-paid gift card which I had paid for through our hotel stay at the nearby doubletree.  All of sudden, our waiter mysteriously disappeared with our bill for 15 minutes.  I complained to the manager and all he offered was to \"expedite\" the bill for me. No apology even.  Left a sour taste in my mouth.   Even so, it wasn't about the money.  I  I would go back to the west valley location in a minute because the experience is always fantastic.  At this location, they are just snooty, full of themselves, unfriendly and self-absorbed.  Oh and BTW, while the steak certainly wasn't bad, it wasn't heavenly either.  The wine I selected was sub-par and had no business being on the wine list for a restaurant of this supposed caliber.   And the kids meals included slices of apples as a first course.  Seriously?  They couldn't come up with something more creative than that?"}
{"text":"I would love to give a review of the food or drinks, but my husband and I never got that far. We decided tonight to try Flemmings for the first time. First off, we had a reservation for 7:45, the hostess said we are a \" little bit\" late on our reservation times so feel free to get drinks at the bar. Well at 8:45 we started getting pissed off along with all the other people with reservations getting sat hours after their reservation. Finally, after waiting over an hour past our time and finding out that even then we had 7 people in front of us, we just left. I thought upscale restaurants should have their acts together enough to honor your reservation time at least somewhat close...absolutely ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this Flemings location. After receiving an email advertising a special prime rib promotion for $29.99 I followed the link to make a reservation. However, I got a message saying that the promotion was not being honored at this location. I called and talked to Randy who said that the price at the Scottsdale Road location would be $40 because that's how they chose to offer the special. So I made a reservation at the Flemings at D.C. Ranch only a few more minutes away. For $29.99. 
We had been frequent diners at the Scottsdale Road location but from now on we'll go to D.C. ranch. If you use the Flemings brand you should honor the promotions."}
{"text":"Service was unbelievable, awesome they treat you like royalty. Scottsdale Road and Lincoln would explain the pricing $12.00 for baked potato, a little bit expensive but the food is really good"}
{"text":"I came here with my fiance about 2 months ago (I'm late to post the review...I know). 
We are such food people that when it comes to going out and spending money on a good steak, we love it. We have been to Roy's, Mastro's, City Hall... you name it!  So we decided to give Fleming's a shot. We were so incredibly disappointed. The food was decent, Id say a little over price for the quality, but the service... oh goodness. 
Not to say that my fiance and I are prim and proper, but we do live a luxurious life style and appear like we do as well . (meaning we don't dumpster drive then try to act classy in public). The waitress made us feel like we did not belong there what so ever! Such a strange feeling! I'm not sure if she was tired of being a server or what, but it was bad. It left me feeling like a loser... We could not get out of there fast enough, more like she could not get us out of Fleming's fast enough.. 

regardless, to say we probably will not come back is an understatement. Plus with the people that we know, my fiance and I will definitely advise them to choose a different option. 

End of rant...."}
{"text":"After making a reservation for 6pm and asking specifically if they serve Beef Wellington I was told yes indeed and that they could prepare it for me this evening.  That was at noon and so I rescheduled my flight out and arrived at the Hilton Village location, at 530pm.  Only to be told by the hostess that the chef saw my request and did not have any time to go get any puffed pastry for the day so I was out of luck.  (Keep in mind I was told at the time of reservation that only this Flemings location which is one of two in Phoenix could prepare Beef Wellington at the tine I made my reservation).  They then said they tried to call me but there was no anssr?!.  Ooops on that lie.. the number they had was the Westin Kierland Resort open 24/7 and so someone would have answered if they only tried.  Now it is 545 and I am on the hunt for Wellington."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened at Flemings tonight, but the place was  totally falling apart.
Tough prime rib, lousy service, and people running all over the place trying to get it together...not a good experience at all.
We waited for someone to come to our table to get our dessert selections, drink refills and our check for about 50 minutes.
I don't know what was going on, but I doubt we'll be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was as well.  Went for my wife's birthday dinner with our kids.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been to dinner and HH here.  Both visits were fabulous.  The steak was one of the finest pieces of meat that I have ever had.  The tuna appetizer was delicious.  Tonight I had the HH hamburger for the amazing price of $7 and it was as good as any $15 burger in town.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I understand Flemings is dropping the Prime Rib dinner in May and coming up with a new concept.  They should think about why business is off.....This may be our final time of going there.  Prime rib was almost cold, the French fries were dripping in fat and were probably fried once, and then reheated by refrying.  The hamburger was cold, along with another prime rib.  The only thing that was at proper temperature was the New York Steak.  The manager apologized, but how do 3 meals come out cold when you have someone back there that is supposed to be watching that everything comes out of the kitchen properly.  This is supposed to be a high end steak house.....don't think so.  It's happened too many times before.  Staff is weak and management isn't paying close attention.  Try another place.  Am sure it will be better."}
{"text":"I think Fleming's is the cat's meow! Great service!  Fantastic food! Interesting wine choices! I love that they offer wine flights. I don't know of any other steak houses in town do that (if anyone else does, please email me). 

Shhhh....don't tell, but Flemning's is my 2nd fave after Mastro's!!

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse with a lot of delicious options. The ribeye steak was very tasty and cooked exactly as ordered. The Fleming's salad is so good and the walnut turtle pie is one of he best deserts I have ever enjoyed. Table service is top notch but the ambience needs some improving, as its too dark and noisy inside."}
{"text":"Great Service. Great Food. Always done perfect. Thanks to Fleming's for a great night out with the family."}
{"text":"As like the one in Chandler, it is more on the casual side then what we are used to in L.A.  We decided to go for our Vday dinner since they offered both set and regular menus that night.  We were gonna order from the regular menu since we usually are not fond of set menu.  However, the set menu looked pretty good and the server was trying hard to sell it so we decided to give it a try.

*Appetizer = pretty nice*
*Main course = huge! and tasty.
*Sides = honestly, not good
*Atmosphere = louder than desired...."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday and I was not blown away.  

The cocktail menu lists the vodkas used and two they list are Pinnacle and Svedka.  Really?  Low end vodka at a high end steakhouse?  I could literally buy an entire bottle of vodka for what they charge for a cocktail (not that the cocktail prices are unreasonable - they aren't... but using low quality vodka is strange).  

Our sides (mac n' cheese and asparagus) were not seasoned well.  Once we added salt, they were quite tasty but again, you expect more from a high end steakhouse. 

My medium rare steak was more rare than medium.  Again, I would expect this not to be an issue at a high end steakhouse.  

The restaurant itself is beautiful and our service was good.  None of it was terrible but given all of the options for steak, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is good. I sat at the bar and had a wedge salad and a couple drinks. Service was good, not particularly friendly, just good. I would probably have ordered something else to eat but it was all so absurdly expensive that I just couldn't pull the trigger.  That doesn't happen to me often. Maybe if i was having more fun? Anyway - the salad was good, I'd do that again if i were in the area."}
{"text":"What a great way to celebrate our anniversary!

We received a gift card through amex and decided to give Fleming's a try for our anniversary.  We are so happy we did and we will return!

We sat outside on the patio and loved the atmosphere.  It was a chilly evening but with the heaters it was perfect.

I had the Newport filet and my husband the peppercorn steak.  We shared both and were both pleased with each cut of meat.  They were both cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were to die for, we probably should have ordered an extra serving.

Our service was top notch.  Cody went above and beyond to make our experience perfect.  We were so comfortable and never had the feeling like we were dining at a large restaurant.  She was so personable and gave us her personal opinions on the menu and drinks, which we took and were so pleased with.  When we return we will be requesting her section again as we felt so welcome.  Thank you to Cody for making our evening even more special.

We can't wait to return not only for the amazing food but the service.  Everyone that came to our table was super friendly, it was so refreshing to have such great service."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place highly enough! We had a very special family event that Megan and Seth made easy and perfect for us. The food was outstanding, the services was excellent, and the ambiance was lovely. Chef Jeff is a genius (and Seth actually brought him out to meet us) and Justin, our server, was down-to-earth, professional and attentive. Seth also helped with a red wine recommendation that was smooth and delicious. For all of this, I actually consider their prices a bargain. Thank you all for making this once-in-a-lifetime celebration so perfect!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorites are sweet chili calamari l, tenderloin Carpacio and french onion soup. From the dessert menu i loveee blueberry cheesecake!!! Great wine menu and great service ! Thank you."}
{"text":"Here is a recap of our meal: my filet with lump crab was ordered medium rare and it came well done. My son's bone-in steak was also ordered medium rare and came well done to the point that it was black on the outside. Also it was half the thickness that the same order is served him in locations in CA. My wife's order of two lobster tails was fine for the first tail and the second tail was raw inside. After getting it back it was still raw. My daughter's boyfriend's prime rib was indeed as he asked for but it was again half the thickness as the other Flemings places. My daughter ordered the short ribS. There was one rib.  We also all noticed that the sides were MUCH smaller than the same sides in CA. Maybe Chef was running low on food...I'd rather be told that the kitchen was out of what I wanted than to be served a tiny portion and then be charged the full price.  My first manhattan was watery and had little taste.  My second one was much better. When paying that much for food and drink I expect things to be better.  
We appreciated not having to pay for that food Sunday and I hope that the waiter knew that  we didn't blame him. There was a young woman that was clearing things from the table and when I told her that my wife's lobster was still raw she grabbed the plate from my hand and almost hit me with it when she left the table. I emailed the manager and received NO answer; only the comp of the meal and some gift cards to return there and a promise that things will be perfect the next time. I'm supposed to email her and tell her when we'll be there. I doubt that she cares."}
{"text":"I've been to Flemings in Boston as well as this location, and they always do a great job.  I went last night to celebrate buying a new house with my fianc√©e. Not only did the hostess congratulate us, but our waiter Nate (who was fantastic) did the same; Jeff the manager even came over to congratulate us as we'll and gave us a gift card for our next visit. The food was spot on (bone in ribeye, porcini rubbed filet), but the extra touch from the staff/mgmt blew us away. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered a medium well filet mignon and it came to me rare. I specifically stated that I only wanted a slight pink, not red, raw, & bloody. All three of the filets were like that. Potatoes were cold and Caesar salads were made with ice burg lettuce. Ridiculous and will not be returning. Worse steak house yet!"}
{"text":"We were 2 couples this past Saturday night and for a high end restaurant, this was a less than good evening.  One patron was drinking wine, while the other 3 were drinking iced tea.  The order was for a 12 oz. glass.  Ten minutes after the iced tea was brought to the table, my wine had yet to be delivered.  When it finally came, after complaining to the manager, it was only 6 oz. Next - one of the diners had a petite filet which had to be sent back because it was so tough.  The 2nd one was not a whole lot better.  Better, but not significantly so.  The servers and manager were most cordial and apologetic and a significant discount was given, along with a complimentary gift card, however, this experience was extremely disappointing.  We have eaten here before, and don't know if there has been a change in the kitchen, but we will think twice about returning and telling our friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had went in here around June 20th to a start to our 3 week vacation we did show up a little late which I hate doing but they were very kind to us at the door and insured us that they were still open for another hour. It was one of the best dinners I've had to start with the perfect grey goose martini that we both love a little extra dirty to the house made BURRATA that was to die for its the best ever then we shared a filet cooked to perfection and for side we had the Fleming potatoes which were amazing as well and the asparagus!!! I really enjoyed this and we will be back thank you for a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Great place! Everything was set up before i even arrived. Great manager who came by to ensure everything was well"}
{"text":"My friend, my wife and I went for happy hour. Two martinis, a cosmo and 4 happy hour dishes and great servers. I used to work for tips, so I overdo it. Nonetheless I paid $60 total!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  My petite filet was awful.  Service was good but there are much better restaurants than this one."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and have a second home in Scottsdale.  When I'm in town I usually make it a point to dine at least once at this restaurant,.   I like the location (DC Ranch), ambiance, menu, wine list and service (outstanding).

I am becoming disillusioned due to the kitchens inability to cook a steak properly.

This is the second time I have experienced this issue.  The first time my girlfriend and I came in for the steak and lobster special.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, but the steak was overcooked.  We sent them back and this time mine was acceptable and hers was again overcooked. The third time for her was the charm.  The evening proceeded perfectly and the management graciously comped our meals.

Most recently I came in with a party of six, again for the steak and lobster special.  Again all of us that ordered the steak and lobster (4) had the steaks overcooked.  We returned them and the second time they were as we ordered them.  Again we had the meals comped that were not cooked to order.

Gilling steaks is not \"rocket science\".  I hope that management takes note of this issue, and better supervises the cook line.

I eat at Flemings for a variety of reasons, and getting a \"free\" meal is not one of them."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. We love their  steaks( always cooked perfectly) 
 and the relaxing atmosphere. My daughter and I had the filet and scallop special. Which was very good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was invited by Robyn N. to join her at the Paso Robles Wine Tasting VIP Event sponsored by yelp here and I gladly accepted the invitation. It was a great opportunity to try several of Fleming's offerings at once, and  to pair them with different wines as well. The wines were all lovely and the dishes that Fleming's offered for the event blew me away! We had a variety of excellent cheeses, always a great way to flatter excellent wines. Sweet chile calamari had a very pleasant sweet tangy sauce that lightly coated the tender squid. The roasted mushroom ravioli featured a delicious porcini butter sauce coating pasta pillows stuffed with portabello and shiitake -- a must-try for all mushroom lovers. We also had steak crostini,  melt-in-your-mouth tenderloin carpaccio, seared ahi tuna -- all excellent. The wine tasting event turned out to be a superb dining experience as well."}
{"text":"Came here for AZ Restaurant Week. This place was completely packed on a Tuesday night, but we'd made reservations ahead of time so we were immediately seated. This place is dimly lit, but not to the extreme where you cannot read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light. That's annoying so things were already off to a great start. 

Everything was delicious. I loved the sun-dried tomato butter that came with the bread. We had very generous servings of the french onion soup. It's the best I've had. It was very flavorful. We ordered the lamb and the fillet Mignon. Both were pretty good. I'm not sure what to think of the mint sauce that came with the lamb. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. We ended off the night stuffing ourselves with a creme brulee and chocolate mousse. We find it hard to say no to dessert. 

The service was great. Our glasses of water and wine were never empty and our courses were fairly well timed. 

I hear they have a great happy hour and I liked the bar area so we will certainty be back for drinks."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious dinner and great service.  Its a beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere.   The steaks don't compare with Mastros but the entire meal was incredible and we highly recommend it for a great meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here last night for his birthday and we were blown away! I had first dined at Fleming's over 10 years ago and wasn't a huge fan. At the time I felt that all of the other steak houses were better at that price point. It wouldn't have been my first choice for a special occasion dinner, but I had a gift card burning a hole in my pocket. We figured why not use it for this, and we were so glad that we did!

I had made a reservation online and noted that it was a birthday dinner. Fleming's went out of their way to acknowledge this, and really made the night a special evening. We were greeted by name when we were seated, asked whose birthday it was (nice touch 1) and given an ipad with an extensive wine list. It was fun choosing a bottle this way because you had a wealth of information regarding the flavors and notes of the wine. We were then served a complimentary warm Parmesan bread loaf with two delicious herb and brie butters (nice touch 2). 

We decided to split the Caesar salad, wagyu NY strip with onion rings and the chipotle mac and cheese. They brought the salad out with two plates along with chilled forks (nice touch 3). I really enjoyed the fried capers and prosciutto in the salad. The wagyu NY strip was cooked perfectly to our asking of medium rare. The onion rings are some of the best I've had, super crispy and not surprising that this is their signature item. The mac and cheese was just as good and flavorful, very rich. For dessert we shared the carrot cake which was layered in cream cheese frosting and was served with fresh Chantilly whipped cream on the side (nice touch 4).

While we were dining, the manager visited our table and wished my husband a happy birthday. He then gave us a gift card for $25 to return (nice touch 5). At the end of the meal they brought out a complimentary box of chocolate truffles with a lit birthday candle (nice touch 6).

Summary of extra nice touches
1) Birthday acknowledgement
2) Complimentary fresh baked bread with delicious flavored butters
3) Chilled forks for the salad
4) Fresh whipped cream served on the side with dessert
5) $25 gift card to return
6) Complimentary box of truffles with birthday candle

I would not hesitate to return to Fleming's, especially for a special occasion. They really went above and beyond. I can't believe at one point they were my least favorite steak house and now they're one of my favorites! You can tell they made some great positive changes that sets them apart from the competitors."}
{"text":"Have eaten MANY times @ Flemings.  Only sat in the bar at the South Scottsdale location, but sat in the dining room last weekend.  From the time we sat down and cold air was blowing on us, it was a disaster.  Still have GC for them so will use it up at DC Ranch location which has much better dining room service."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. We were here for a birthday as well as a homecoming for a military member. Flemings went all out with making us all feel special. Truly a class act. The waiter Joseph was extremely friendly as well as helpful and went way above and beyond to make it a special evening. Thank you Joseph and Flemings for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Flemings
We are seasonal residents.  We always loved happy hour at Flemings.
The burger was outstanding andhe wine was a great value.
Last night we had happy hour there. The menu has changed. Wine is now the same price as on the dinner menu.  They added a prime rib dip sandwich which I ordered.  The bun was stale and the meat was cold. When I asked about it the manager said they did not want to overheat it.  Well guess what I don't like cold meat!  I sent it back and ordered the prime burger. That also was a disappointment.  Not the same great burger of previous times.  Not as juicy or as well accompanied with great sauce as before.  Hate to say it but happy hour just isn't what it used to be!!   Sorry for the scathing review"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was just ok. I would rate them at the low end of the high priced steak houses. The service was good but the food was just ok
We split a salad that was well..... average. Lots of onions and not a lot of lettuce.
One of the two dinner orders was the shrimp and scallops on grits. The shrimp was fresh and tasty as was the scallops. The grits were very good and cooked just right.
The other order was a filet seared rare plus and the Flemings potatoes. The steak was served warm (like it sat for a bit) and the potatoes were just a bit warmer. The steak was good but not great as were the potatoes and hotter would have been better. 
Desert was a creme br√ªl√©e that lacked taste and my coffee arrived at room temperature. No biggy, they made a fresh pot and fixed that."}
{"text":"I gave this a two star because the service was very good and friendly...the food has always been excellent at Flemings until this visit...the steaks were over seasoned with pepper and spices.  The creamed spinach was also over seasoned.  I had a filet and my husband had the prime aged rib eye steak and both were very disappointed  My husband told the manager but his response was saying he would inform the chef...we live on DC Ranch and hoped to have a great meal ...maybe will try again some time ."}
{"text":"The food is over seasoned with a hot spicy pepper so if you like it that way it's the restaurant for you. I was very disappointed and I ordered lamb chops which burned my mouth. Never again!"}
{"text":"We visited Fleming's on a Thursday evening, after making 7:15pm reservation via their website.  The place was absolutely packed, a great surprise.  When we arrived early, we did have to wait for our table to be ready (to be expected), and had a chance to sample their \"5 for $6\" Happy Hour drink menu, which stops at 7:00pm.  The Manhattan and Peach Sparkler were quite good for only $6 each.  While waiting, we used the iPad wine menu to explore the many, many wine selections that would be available to us at dinner.

Once seated for dinner, we had fantastic service from our servers, who were always attentive and helpful throughout the meal.  Their homemade bread and butters were great for a start while waiting for our orders.  Instead of wine, we went with the special Pomegranate and Sage Margarita, which was delicious.  For food, we decided to order their Seasonal Menu, a wonderful 2-course taste sensation starting with Lemon Ricotta Crostini with Fresh Pear Slices for an appetizer, and then an Iron Seared Delmonico Steak with tangy bearnaise butter and spiced blue crab topping.  It also came with a crisp potato cake and heirloom carrots. 

Unfortunately, one of our steaks was not cooked as well done as ordered, and had to go back to the kitchen.  The resulting extra/twice-cooked steak was disappointing at best.  This is the only black mark on an otherwise excellent dining experience.  To Fleming's credit, the manager came over to the table to apologize, without our asking, and did offer to remove the entire 2-course meal charge off the bill for the steak preparation mistake.  You really can't ask for anything more.  Mistakes do occasionally happen, and they really stepped up and took care of us when it did.  Other than this little problem, I would have rated them a full 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.  Great place to splurge. Great wine list and dining selections. I had fish and it tasted very fresh to be away from water. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":". Poor quality steak for $60. Their so called signature mac and cheese? came out of the microwave and obviously they didn't heat it up well because it arrived very cold and it was tasteless. It is definitely not worth the $100 I spent on 1 person. However, the staff was nice so I gave it 2 stars. But I'm sorry I will not go there again."}
{"text":"I will be totally up front this is my favourite steak restaurant.  I love this place for one reason and one reason only:tenderloin carpaccio    The meat, the mustard sauce the crisp Parmesan toast is magical to eat. I have tried other restaurants and nothing comes even close to this. 

We were seated in a booth.  I was so happy there was enough light to read a menu without resorting to flashlights. I find the table area to have poor lighting. I hate sitting at a table and feeling I am older than I actually am due to the inability to see a menu. I wish more places would consider their target audience and light tables accordingly. I am not suggesting brighter than the noon day sun lighting, but a little brighter please 

Disappointed with the bread. It was dry and lacked substance. Not worth the calories to eat. 

Our table ordered the double thick pork chop,  and the small plate hangar steak. For sides Fleming potatoes and Thai beans

The hangar steak was excellent and served with chilaquiles casserole and fennel slaw. Tasty. The casserole had a little bit of a kick to it which was tempered by the fennel slaw

I had a taste of the pork chop and the apple that accompanied it. The moistness of the chop and the sweetness of the apple  together would have made Angels sing. 

The Flemings potatoes were excellent , but the beans I would not bother with next time. Another vegetable choice would be nice. 

The disappointing part of the menu is the desserts. I always look to see if something has changed ,but it is always the same. Once there was a frozen lemonade pie on the menus, but nothing even remotely exciting since. Flemings, the molten lava cake is so yesterday and a really tired dessert. I know that you need to keep classics on there, but please add something a little more exciting"}
{"text":"We have a ton of top notch steakhouses in Chicago and even though there's a fairly-recently opened Fleming's down the street from me, we decided to check out this one because we were in town and said, why the hell not? 

(Let me tell you something I love about Arizona: in Chicago, you could never get away with wearing a t-shirt, shorts, sandals and a straw fedora to a steakhouse. But, luckily for me, things seem to be more lax in AZ. Also, lucky for me because my bags were on my original flight back to Chicago and I, clearly, was not.)

Anyway, my buddy and I sat in the bar section, where it was a little more lively, so we could catch some highlights and relax. Everything I ordered was superb. Started off with a perfectly made No. 10 martini (kudos) and then went with the Wedge. The blue cheese dressing was excellent. Then I, of course, went right for the Bone-In Ribeye (med. rare). When it came out, it was as if God, himself, was speaking directly to me. Perfectly cooked, pefectly marbled, great cut of beef. I don't even remember what sides we ordered, it didn't matter. Either way, Flemings: they know how to make a drink, they know how to cook a steak, and they're pretty cool about the whole thing. Go there."}
{"text":"Good, but far from great.

I don't know who was cooking that night, but everything was poorly seasoned! It was like they completely ran out of salt. Not like it was light on the salt, everything tasted as if salt was banished from the kitchen.

We had the prime rib special and I have to admit I was disappointed. I ordered rare + (just a tad over rare) but I experienced several places in my healthy 12oz portion that were raw. The other guests I were with experienced the same. I would still rate it good, but lacking a nice mellow beef flavor.

With the prime rib came 3 delicious sauces: spicy asian mustard, horseradish, and au jus. Not being a fan of horseradish, it was pleasantly surprised to find it light on the horseradish and more to the mayonnaise taste. Very well done, congrats!

For sides the four of us split the Fleming's potatoes, chipotle mac-n-cheese, asparagus, and spinach. The Fleming's potatoes were good, but a bit dry and very little of the creamy sauce they so tout. The vegetables were severely under seasoned to the point of tastelessness. Again, out with the salt. The only star was the chipotle mac-n-cheese, but it still need salt to bring out the flavor.

For desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of chocolate, but throughly enjoyed the lava case with pistachio ice cream and crisp cookies. Bravo.

Service was good. Our waiter donned a particularly humorous fake Martha's Vineyard accent. It was funny how the accent suddenly dropped when conversing with the other staff. Come on, the snooty Snottsdale attitude when out with the 90's.

While we enjoyed the atmosphere and overall experience, I can't say we will be back anytime soon. Fleming's is becoming left in the mire of the downfall of DC Ranch. Most shops and restaurants have packed up and moved. A bit depressing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our anniversary, and I hadn't been in a long while. Something changed since the last time, because the service was ok, but the food left much to be desired. My filet was no better than what I'd be able to do from the store. The sides were good, but honestly, there's nothing that wants to bring me back. When there are so many great choices for a nice dinner out, for the same price-point, I'd have to go someplace else next time."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Wednesday night, without a reservation but we were seated promptly. All of the staff was friendly and greeted us warmly. Our server Mackenna was very attentive and sweet. The food was cooked perfectly and the flavors were robust and delicious. We had mushroom ravioli, petit filet (cooked perfectly), truffle mashed potatoes, asparagus, and amazing lava chocolate dessert. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We recently had our wedding luncheon at Fleming's and the service/ staff was fantastic! We worked directly with Lesa.  She was very personable and helped to make the wedding planning process stress-free and easy.  She was prompt in responding to all of our emails and was very accommodating of all of our requests.

As far as the food was concerned, everything was prepared to our liking and all of our guests raved about the food which was served.  Some of the stand-out favorites were the Mac & Cheese, the Filet Mignon, and the Lamb Chops. The Fleming's staff helped to truly make our day a memorable one! We'll definitely be back for our Wedding Anniversaries!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, although it was an upscale restaurant it felt very relaxed and friendly. The most recent time I was there was for their happy hour in the bar and it was delicious. During happy hour they have several appetizers for $6 (very friendly on the wallet) The baked Brie served with apple slices was cooked perfectly along with the Wicked Cajun Shrimp. They also have a Fleming's prime burger with cheese and bacon for $6 which was grilled to the perfect medium as we had asked served with these colossal onion rings. We topped our meal off with the Chocolate lava cake (let your server know ahead of time if you want to order this as it does take a while) and the Creme Brulee both of which were delicious. Overall I can't wait to go back and if you are concerned about their prices as they can be quite expensive for dinner trying giving their happy hour a try they call it their \"5 For $6 'Til 7pm\" in the bar area."}
{"text":"It took a little convincing, but Hottie and I decided to give Flemings a second shot.  Let me just say, it was like we dined at a totally difference restaurant!  We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess, who offered us our choice of table (despite the fact that the place was just about at capacity).   To start us off, our server recommended a new specialty cocktail with vodka, fruit juice and Prosseco which was less than 99 calories.   It was delicious! She also recommended a couple Pino Noir options for Hottie, who was very pleased.  I started off with the Flemings salad.  Really nothing special, actually the dressing was rather bland and it was served over romaine.  It really should have been served over spring mix or arugula... and adding a little cheese never hurts!  Regardless, I was perfectly happy with the complimentary warm bread and infused butter spreads to start me off.  For dinner the server recommended a \"super secret\" menu item for vegetarians.    I'm not sure what it was called, but it had layers of spinach, portabella, asparagus and roasted red pepper served over a very tasty red cream sauce .  On the side, I ordered the chipotle mac-n-cheese, YUM!  I don't even want to imagine the number of calories that were stuffed into that plate of cheesy goodness!  My Hottie ordered their special, a filet bone-in cooked medium rare with Flemings potatoes on the side.  This time his steak came out cooked perfectly, in fact by the end he was eating it off the bone... gross! For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I was a little leery, because typically these are served very small and obviously just reheated in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Not the case here.   It was the size of a softball, and just heavenly... warm chocolate oozing out of center, topped with ice cream and some kind of pistachio cookie... mmmm, still licking my lips! Okay, Flemings... Now I'm a FAN!"}
{"text":"Flemings is a safe bet...no matter where you visit. This location is very nice - consistent with all others! 

TIP: Not starving but still want a great meal? Fleming's offers a GREAT small plate menu. Favorites: beef carpaccio, beef filet with risotto and mushrooms, beets with fresh burrata and lamb chops.

Still love the iPad wine list. Had a fabulous, under-appreciated left bank Bordeaux."}
{"text":"A group of family and friends went to Flemings for happy hour this evening. We arrived right at 5pm when they open because it's usually packed for the good happy hour deals (which are restricted to the bar and patio). Plus we had a group of six; we sat on the lovely patio very nice ambiance and weather. 

The calamari, bread basket and prime burger were great. The house burrata was interesting, described to us as deconstructed bruschetta. The Flemings Salad dressing was a bit heavy, the Brussel sprouts were drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. 

The servers and wait staff were very great so professional and friendly. The food took a lifetime to wait for; while I understand we were a large party and a packed restaurant, we were also one of the first tables to sit down seeing that we were sat when the restaurant opened. Tables of 6+ near us also ordered, ate, paid and left before our food arrived...backwards."}
{"text":"I try and I try and I try to like this place but the only thing Fleming's does consistently is let me down!  Simply said... our shrimp appetizers came out sans deveining.  Yes, the digestive track of the shrimp were right there for us to see.  Next, my veal chop came out raw.  RAW!  Cold and uncooked in the center.  I sent it back twice, and finally just gave up.  Amateur hour again.

To their defense, I had an amazing steak at the Dayton, Ohio location.  But at least four other locations have let me down.  Sigh..."}
{"text":"so i get email this AM-prime rib special good for 2 weeks.  call local restaurant on Scottsdale road, and was told it expires this Sunday, 4 days from now.  HUH?  call corporate and they confirm what the local yocal told me.  these folks are disingenuous, do not honor what they send out as a special.  I suggest you do not patronize.  they are all about corporate, not the individual.  their attitude can work now as plenty of snowbirds here now, but we locals shall remember this disingenuous response far longer, when the snowbirds are gone, they need us, and we shall not support."}
{"text":"Um. No. 

One star for the the lovely's filet, he said it was one of the best he's had. Second star for service and the chocolate lava cake. 

When I made the reservation, I told them it was Jeff's birthday. Upon arrival, they wished him a happy birthday and escorted us from the [handsome but very noisy] main dining room into what looks like a converted private space. No ambiance, no windows but quieter. 

And although we appreciate a reprieve from the noise, there was piped in [bad] music. Ugh. So I'm sitting in the back forty, eating a $9 salad that is mostly chopped iceburg lettuce, some cherry tomato and a few candied walnuts, drinking a Smirnoff Cosmo [my fault for not specifying the vodka] that had almost half a lime in it. 

Dinner was the lovely's 6 oz filet, baked potato and asparagus, and my Lobster tempura. He was happy, I was not. To their credit, lobster was perfectly cooked and but the tempura coating was so greasy - greasy as in they didn't drain it properly. The soy ginger sauce had so much salt I couldn't enjoy it and the accompanying jicama salad was overdressed. 

The chocolate lava cake was yummy, coffee was meh. 

Before dessert, manager Tracy brought a gift card and wished Jeff a happy birthday - a nice touch but we wont got back. For almost $200 we can have a stellar meal, more food, and a lovely experience at Capital Grille."}
{"text":"This Fleming's is top notch! My boyfriend and I went on a weekend getaway and stayed at the Hilton where this Fleming's is also located. We decided to treat ourselves somewhere a little fancy, so we thought why not try this place. Mind you, this is both our first time trying Fleming's. We placed an order for the crab cake appetizer ($20 if I can recall) and ordered our main course (steak of course). We started chit chatting like normal, over heard a lady on the other table. she asked if they serve plastic utensils cuz she didn't like how metal felt with her teeth. The hostess replied, \"of course! you're at Fleming's. We can get you what you want\", so we saw the manager walk out and he came back with plastic utensils from the hotel. We were like, wow! So a few mins passed by and the waiter came to our table and apologized. We both looked confused as to why he apologized? He said, \"I apologize that the crab cakes hasn't came out yet\". We both said, \"oh it's ok. Don't worry about it\". He left and we both said I didn't even notice it was late. lol. A couple of mins later the manager came to our table and also apologized for the crab cakes being late. Again we said, \"ohh it's ok. It's fine, no worries\" and he left. We were like damn, even the manager apologized for that. Wow, how sweet. Then finally the crab cakes arrived and it was specially delivered to our table by the head chef! And yes, he too apologized! We were in awe by the excellent service!! The food was amazing. Meat was so tender and tasty and the mash potatoes were delicious. When the bill came, they complimented the crab cakes (which I forgot to mention was soooooo good! real crab meat). We both left pleased and with a memory we won't ever forget. :D"}
{"text":"I will never again visit this or any other Flemings restaurant. The management at this location is horrendous. The server presented a solution to an issue, set improper expectations and returned to our table indicating that the manager did not even let him finish his sentence before he said \"NO\". Manager (Randy Canada) knew that we were having a horrible experience and didn't have the testicular fortitude to come to the table. Upon leaving I was met with a chuckle and a smirk, and handed his business card. Upon emailing him it took days to get a response, he refused to provide corporate contact information on 3 different occasions, and after a week, I needed to copy the President of Flemings to get a reply. If this is the type of childish leaders that Flemings promotes, that have no concept of conflict resolution., then we simply do not see eye to eye. I will never return."}
{"text":"We go to DC ranch Flemings and it's always perfect however we decided to this location just to try a different ambiance but we are really disappointed. 
The calamari appetizer and steaks were great.  The salad was really tiny , not sure why. 
It took a really long time, 30 min between appetizer and salad. We thought they ran out of lettuce. 
The worst part is that my girlfriend went to the restroom and there is no toilet paper and the paper towel is really low too. 
When I went to the men's restroom the paper towel was almost out and the Kleenex  box was completely out as we'll.  
you would think someone should check the restroom periodically at a nice restaurant  .

I've learned my lesson and stick to the DC ranch Flemings. 
y"}
{"text":"Always great !!!!  Be to this Flemings about twenty times.  
I like this location more because its less busy than the other scottsdale location .
Also you can buy gift cards from costco for $80 and get $100 face value. 
What a bargin."}
{"text":"The food was great, but I have to deduct points for the slower than usual service. We celebrated 50th anniversary with my in-laws and I thought it would have been a nice touch to get a personalized plate. But did not happen. Maybe I expected too much. We celebrated at Ruth Chris before and it was a little bit more personal there."}
{"text":"From the friendly greeting at the front door, to the cheerful bartender and our excellent server, Amanda, it was a great evening.

The Prime Rib special was a real deal and cooked to perfection.  The sides were very well prepared and seasoned.  The wine list had some very good wines at reasonable prices.  The new head chef, Nick came out to greet me and wish me a Happy Birthday.

Great place with a very welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service- Great!
Moscow Mules- Great!
Mandarian sangria- sangria are my favorite so I'm picky,  this didn't cut it, but my waiter was nice enough to see that and exchange it out for a Moscow Mule
Calamari- not for me
Mashed potatoes- Great!
Porkchop- okay, bland in my opinion
Filet mignon- very tender and moist but bland
Creme brulee- okay
Chocolate lace cake- okay

I've been try Flemings, but now that I have I would have to say it is somewhat overrated. There is definitely better out there. I probably also on be back, because I won't spend another , $200 + dollars on a second chance."}
{"text":"Really good food with exceptional service as well. 

Took clients out for dinner and this is where we ended up. The meal was perfect.

started with the seafood tower, Came with Lobster Tail and Crab Legs, Yum i had to order a second tower as well cause it was to die for.

for my meal i went with the Lamb Chops. The bite as perfect and juicy. Ordered it medium rare. i didn't even have to use any sauce with it as well. it was perfectly cooked as it. 

I over stuffed myself with food because of the taste and how fresh the meat was, Tender just the way i liked it. the chew was soft and went down easily.

There service is on point and some of the best service that i have seen yet, this place deserves a 5 star rating.

If your in the area and looking to be wined and dined, then this is your spot, its nice and quiet here so you don't have to speak up or listen in to hear the other person."}
{"text":"On Easter, our family normally goes out for a steak dinner.  This year, we decided to try Flemings, after receiving a few gift cards over the Holidays.

We made reservations weeks in advance, which is something I would recommend btw.  We arrived on time and were seated within a few minutes.  We found it to be a treat to be seated near the kitchen.

The food at Fleming's was good, but the service was somewhat disorganized.  In upscale steak houses, your server is always watching to see if you need anything and is very much on top of things: topping off glasses and getting a sense of timing on when to bring things out.

Here, even with four Culinary Managers walking around, our server was gone for long stretches of time.  Our two glasses of wine took fifteen minutes and our salads were completely forgotten.  Our server only caught the error just before our Entr√©es arrived. 

Our meal ran in the low twos, as you would expect for a party of three, or about $70 each, not including gratuities or taxes.  Our three course Prime Rib (photo) dinner ran $40.95 seemed about right, as was their Double Breast Chicken was $34.95.  We also ordered the Macaroni & Cheese Lobster (photos), Creamy Spinach, Spicy Habanero Skillet Potatoes for the table. 

It was inevitable that during dessert, we started comparing Fleming's to our other Easter dinners.  The consensus was that Flemings was: \"Three Stars, A-Okay, with no je ne said quo.\" when compared to other places nearby.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!! Great price, and delicious steak melted in my mouth :) I always get steak when I come to Flemmings... almost every week :)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. 

The other day I received a $50 gift card in the mail for Flemings Steakhouse. There has to be a catch right? Apparently not. I registered the card on Flemings website and made reservations for the following Friday evening. 

The gift card specifically stated \"valid only in the main dining room\" but I noticed that college football was on the TV in the bar. My dinner companion also enjoys football so I asked the hostess if we could still use my gift card in the bar, she kindly told us, \"sure, as long as you order off the dinner menu.\" Perfect. 

I quickly realized that my $50 wasn't going to get me very far. Most entrees were in the $30+ range and everything was a la carte. I ordered the scallops with puff pastry and veggies. For my side, what else but macaroni and cheese.  The scallops were very good. Cooked perfectly. The puff pastry wasn't bad either. The macaroni and cheese on the other hand was sublime (I hate that word, but I couldn't think of another way to describe it). My dining companion also has a fantastic fillet and his sauteed mushrooms was a bit garlicky, but also very good. He had a fillet at Ruth's Chris recently and told me the Flemings steak won hands down. I knew I should have ordered a steak!  

I know that Flemings is part of a large corporate chain, and I hate chains, but I have to admit my dinner experience here was great. I just hope I get a promotion at work soon so I can come here more often, or maybe they will continue to send me $50 gift cards, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Just came over for HH on the patio.  First off the service was awesome.  My favorite of the four appetizers I ordered was the homemade burrata.  The prime burger is very filling and a popular choice for the night, at least one person from every table ordered one.  The calamari was soft and sweet but I think crispier may have been better.  The carpaccio was good but not as savory just creamier.   Regardless the red blend was a great pairing for the above appetizers."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great atmosphere and service.  I forgot to ask what wine the waitress brought me but I really liked it. I will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and felt like having a great meal. Flemings didn't let me down. I walked in and sat at the bar. They brought me some fresh kettle chips which were awesome. The sourdough bread with the sun dried tomato spread and some sort of Gorgonzola spread were amazing. I went with the wedge for a salad. It was huge! Presentation was great, it had a full piece of bacon and a block of blue cheese. For the main course I decided to go with the Filet and flight special. I had the filet with the peppercorns and then Oscar styled. The steak was cooked to perfection, so perfect I almost didn't even need a knife. I left very full and happy. I absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful Thanksgiving dinner at Flemings in Scottsdale today. Great service and fantastic selection of food, something to please everyone. Their prime rib is always the best!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first review... Ever. So no I'm not a snob. If you want to pay $55.00 for a $10.00 steak go ahead, steak was cooked well, doesn't matter when it tastes like you marinated it with thin air. I only started cooking for myself about 3 years ago and I can cook a better salmon bought from Costco any day... Don't waste your time. Seriously there are so many good places to eat around here that you don't need to waste money.  They also seated us one hour and five minutes after our reservation... I mean I realize things get busy but can you throw me a free drink or appetizer for waiting an hour when I had a reservation... They didn't even acknowledge our wait. Please don't waste your time or money here. Pure price gouging. I will never recommend or eat at this place again. I honestly think I've had a better filet at Applebee's."}
{"text":"Love Fleming's and this location! This is our special occasion stop. The food and service is always outstanding. Ask for Jason he will take good care of you. He has been there a long time."}
{"text":"This last weekend we celebrated a milestone 60th anniversary party and wanted to go someplace special.  Seth C. booked us the private room and it was amazing.  The server Justin was on top of his game he was attentive to all of our needs from the time we sat down until we left.  Seth C. kept checking on us to make sure everything was perfect and even introduced us to Chef Jeff.  The food was amazing and the experience was 5 star. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour...7 days a week from 5-7pm at the bar.  Nice ambiance, nice bartenders, good drinks and yummy food all for $6 each."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had a fantastic 12 oz filet and 2 lobster tails!! We had a nice bottle of Pinot Noir and Jason Santa Maria was an excellent server!!! Such a fabulous touch to be given a box of four house made truffles!! Excellent experience!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to go for a splurge on special occasions, however, the last time we were there, they had changed their menu and replaced our favorite items. I loved the filet slices with risotto and chili oil, as well as the heirloom tomato and beet salad, and both are gone. Before that, the filet mignon skewers were my go-to item, but those have been replaced as well. I assume my favorites were not popular picks or they wouldn't have replaced them, so I suppose I can't blame them for that. I was surprised to see that my husband's favorite side, the garlic mashed potatoes, are also gone. It was good while it lasted, but we'll be looking for a new place to celebrate special occasions in the future."}
{"text":"I'm afraid because of the departure of Scott Yanni, the Operating Partner and the Head Chef, Flemings Scottsdale has nose-dived. :( The Flemings potatoes are still to die for, however, well-done steak doesn't mean burnt and dry. The service isn't as impeccable as it once was with our server being distracted and not on pointe. 

I've heard that the Flemings line is owned by the same company who owns Outback Steakhouse and they want to be more hands-on with Flemings. Frankly, they are ruining a really good thing. Get Scott back--quick!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, above average food.  I've been here a couple times now and giving the place 4 stars because of the atmosphere and the service.  The last time we were here was during the Barrett Jackson auto show.  We had originally just gone for happy hour and were hoping to get a booth.  It was packed, and we had mentioned under our breath that we had hoped to get a booth.  We didn't press the issue because we weren't sure if we were going to stay for dinner, but apparently that was enough for them to take it upon themselves and put us on the list without us asking.  About the time we got our 2nd round of drinks, a waiter approached us and said we have a booth ready for you if you would like it.  I wish I remembered his name, because he was such a pro at his job.  We sat and decided to get some carpaccio and the lobster appetizer.  Although it was busy and packed with characters from the show, our waiter was patient and on task with allowing us to enjoy our spot as long as we wanted.  Well, it worked because we decided to order a bottle of wine and share a steak also.  The filet was delicious and clearly prime grade as advertised.  There are a few better steaks out there just based on my personal flavor preference, but I would jump at the chance to go here and would recommend taking guests here in an instant."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Happy Hour on Valentines Day and I must say, we intended to have dinner as well but the healthy portions took us by surprise. Everything we ordered was wonderful. We had the classic shrimp cocktail (they actually gave an even number (4) instead of most restaurants that give you an odd (3, 5) amount so someone goes without. Followed by the Beef Carpaccio (fantastic). Then we split the Prime Burger (Bacon/Cheddar) YUM. An order of the Cajun Shrimp (perfectly spiced) and last but not least a clean finish of Seared Ahi. 

And you wonder why dinner was out of the question. Everything was priced at $6 including certain wine and cocktail selections. Well worth it and the happy hour is available nightly till 7pm. 

We are looking forward to returning soon for our main course and will definitely be back with some friends for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Fun but crowded. Server was very good. Dinner was excellent. Lobster bisque was outstanding. Pricey especially the drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to this Flemings many times over the years and it's always outstanding. We reserved a table late and let them know it was my girlfriends birthday and, sure enough, best booth in the house! First of all, our server Kevin was hospitable and went above and beyond the call of duty. Typically then service here is good but tonight was excellent. Steaks.. My favorite food, and the dry aged ribeye here is bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. I started with the French onion because I've been getting in the gym recently and had minimal guilt. The lava cake was a bridge too far but it was her birthday.. Really delicious! Flemings potatoes are usually a must and the creamed corn had a nice zip to it. Always a great wine selection here and always on my list of \"when are we going to..\""}
{"text":"I took my husband here for our anniversary because I had heard good things, but I wasn't impressed.

The service was great, but the steaks were only ok for the price. I spent a lot of money and I don't feel like I got the bang for the buck I was looking for. 

Plus the drunk hotel guests making a stink about not being served any more alcohol...LOUDLY...went on way too long before management dealt with it. And they were still outside 45 minutes later when we left complaining to anyone that would listen."}
{"text":"Delcious and very happy that I was able to convince friends to try my rare NY strip. And now they order rare steak and love your restaurant."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is a great time to go. Spend half, get the same great food. Not the steaks but great appetizers at half price. 5/6/7 happy hour is 5-7 with $6 for some of the wines and appetizers. Try the sirloin flat bread $8 and super good. Ditto for the portabello mushroom ravioli $6. Had the glass and half 9 oz cabs for $12 each. Sat in the patio which is MUCH quieter, same food and great service! Ryan was our waiter and really made us feel welcome. Try it."}
{"text":"My fianc√©, friends and I had a great time this past Sunday! Everyone LOVED our waitress, very sweet and loved how cheerful and kind she was. Just saying the food/drinks was amazing, is a understatement! One of our friends even said his fillet mignon was better then Ruth Chris's. Three(including me) ordered the season sampler with 3 courses, and we all got the first course all together, but my 2nd course was missing, and one the the other waiters said the kitchen miss counted, and was going to get my order in right away. After that happened the supervisor(did not catch his name) came in to check on us, and was very nice. Pretty much everyone in our group got the lava cake dessert, but I had the carrot cake and we all shared and all ended up saying the carrot cake was the best! During dessert the supervisor came back with the truffle box with a candle, the truffle box had one missing, I went to confront the supervisor, he was very sweet and got me another box and asked if i wanted a truffle for everyone in the group, i was under the impression he was going to get a plate of truffles but came back with 5 more boxes, that was very very sweet. I could not be more impressed, even down to the host that recognized me, to the bartender that really knew how to shake a cocktail. We will be returning very soon, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I attended an event here last night.  They set out a pretty good spread buffet style.

* Bikinitini - this is their new 99 calorie drink.  It was very good light and refreshing.  I'm more of a regular martini guy but it never hurts to try something new.

* Porcini rubbed filet mignon and peppercorn steak - both were excellent, tender, juicy and very very tasty.  

* Roasted mushroom ravioli - HOLY COW!  This was amazing.  This is only an appetizer on the menu though for some reason.  I swear I had about 10 of these things.  Next time I go to Flemings I'm going to get a steak on top of a bed of these raviolis. 

As always, the staff of Flemings was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back.

The event we attended was through Foodies Like Us (www.foodieslikeus.com).  It was $15 per person and well worth it for all the great food, wine and cocktails.  It was a bit too crowded though.  Anyway, it is a solid group of people that attend different dining events around the valley.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place was really pricey but extremely delicious! I loved their stuffed mushrooms as well as their filet mignon, minus the blu cheese sauce, ew. Everything was delicious but the portions were really small and basically a bummer because you wanted more and left with a half empty stomach. :/

I would go here for possibly breakfast or brunch but nothing that you would want to be full from. This is the kind of place that once you go here a couple hours later you're going to drive through In-N-Out.

Overall it was pretty good with high prices and small servings. Would go here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Meal was great.  The meat the sides all done well.  Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because we sent our steak back twice cause over cooked but came out perfect the 3rd try.  Our server Reid K. was great.  He noticed our main courses came out to quick as we did not even start our appetizers yet and he sent everything back and had it re done before we even said anything!"}
{"text":"Food was a 10 but service was abysmal from check in to wait staff just a disaster. Otherwise would have rated our visit tonight a 5."}
{"text":"Thank the lord there is a Fleming's in Scottsdale! I am here for school for the week and am so happy there are great restaurants in this nice town. Lucky me, my bf is in town for work so I can FINALLY take him to this place that I have been raving out (see Nashville review for more details on the menu).

They give you two cheese dips here with sliced cracker/bread and celery sticks. One of them being a gorgonzola cranberry spread. DELICIOUS.

We ordered:

TENDERLOIN CARPACCIO - Although I remember it being tastier in the Nashville chain, this is still very good and better than any I have had in California thus far.

SEARED AHI TUNA - love it! This restaurant (not Japanese sushi joints) is why I am so hooked on tuna. Ironic isn't it? My bf loves this too.

BEEF FLEMINGTON filet wrapped in puff pastry with a mushroom duxelle, madeira sauce - This is by far my FAVORITE MEAT dish EVER! They cook it to perfection (remember I am a medium-rare girl), and it simply MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The combination of the tender filet and the buttery pastry is HEAVEN in your mouth. My bf LOVED this too and felt it was an exceptional dish. Ratings for this are up there with Nobu.
 
SEARED SCALLOPS lobster cream sauce with a puff pastry of sauted fresh vegetables - My bf thought this was very good but not as good as the Beef Flemington. We had the ultimate BEST SEARED SCALLOPS in Paris (at an average restaurant too), so it would be hard to have something that is up to par with that. Still a nice tasty dish. I love those puff pastries.

CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE - This is the second best lava cake next to the Culinary Institute of America in Napa. HEAVENLY, FRESH, RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. Delicious! And they don't cheat at this one. No hole on the bottom of the cake to put the filling in! I love bittersweet chocolate. Ummmm.

The wine selection is great. They recommended a smooth Italian red wine for us (I think it was a sirah). The service is great. Despite how large the restaurant is, the high quality of their dishes remain the same. After eating here, then eating at Alexander's (Cupertino, CA -- see my review =D) back home makes any other steakhouse taste mediocre."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5

Yes, I came to eat here twice in a week... AGAIN. We previously dined at the other Scottsdale location. We just wanted to check out a different Fleming's.

We ordered:

LOBSTER TEMPURA - This came with about 1 - 2 lobster tails and tons of veggie tempura. This appetizer is HUGE. I filled up on this but it was really good. They could do without so much veggie tempura though.

BEEF FLEMINGTON filet wrapped in puff pastry with a mushroom duxelle, madeira sauce - Again, this is definitely me and my boyfriend's favorite filet mignon dish. The spices weren't evenly distributed though so some parts of the meat weren't as flavored as other parts. Overall, this dish was still good.

MACARONI AND CHEESE - This was good, but I'm not a fan of bacon bits on top of my mac and cheese. If you like that, then this is for you. 

CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE - Of course we had to order this! Especially since this is the second best lava cake next to the Culinary Institute of America in Napa. Delicious! And they don't cheat at this one. No hole on the bottom of the cake to put the filling in! I love bittersweet chocolate. Ummmm. 

Overall, I felt that out of all the Fleming's restaurants that I have tried, the best are in this order: 1) Nashville location 2) Scottsdale 3) North Scottsdale. This place is still really good, however, the other locations taste a tad bit better."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and the service is a little slow.  Food is amazing. We love Flemings"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my experience here, and nearly all of my meal was if not the best, the very best of that item I have ever had. When I think of my dinner here I think of the Chipotle Mac and Cheese, after I had finished the Mac and Cheese my server told me I should try it with bacon. WTH? I playfully asked her, how could you NOT mention that when I ordered it. The wedge salad was a great wedge, and the lava cake thing was out of this world. I will go back to this place just for the Mac and Cheese. What am I missing here.....thinking.... OH! the steak! 

Forgettable. 


I can't give 4 stars to a restaurant with \"steak\" in their name that serves a tough Rib Eye with gristle, my Aunt's Fillet was however, fantastic. So perhaps just bad luck? But for the price I would hope luck wouldn't come into play. 

I would go back and if I had been paying I would have said something about the steak, maybe it is just me but when someone is buying your Birthday dinner it is bad form to complain about the food."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here. I give it 4.5 stars, would have been 5 if our $80+ steak was prepared like we requested. Got the tomahawk steak and our lobster mac and cheese, however had to send back the steak to cook more so what we were left was lobster mac and cheese. They should have brought both dishes back, to at least keep the mac and cheese warm while our steak was being fixed.

Even with that little hiccup, we had a beautiful bottle of wine and spectacular service."}
{"text":"A small group of coworkers and I went and enjoyed happy hour specials. Fleming's offers 5 options for cocktails, wines, and appetizers for only $6 until 7 p.m. Overall great food, atmosphere, and service. There were a few options for seating, but we chose to be seated inside at a booth, very comfortable and dimmed lighting. Attentive servers, dishes were explained well, and our glasses remained full. 

Everyone had the pinot noir and couldn't just have one glass. When it came time to order food, we decided to try almost everything on their menu. The Sweet Chile Calamari is by far my favorite dish on the menu. It is a sweet, tangy chili glaze covering pieces of calamari mixed with sweet peppers strips and pepperoni.  The Housemade Burrata was my second favorite thing we ordered. Similar to tomato mozzarella but richer... It is a spreadable, soft cheese made from mozzarella and cream served with charred grape tomatoes, arugula, and toasted garlic crostini's. 

We also ordered the Tenderloin Carpaccio was paper-thin beef tenderloin slices that were served with cheese, mixed greens, and baguette slices. The Roasted Butternut Squash was a great texture and perfectly cooked, but too sweet for my taste. The Pan-Crisped Pork Belly was loved by some of my coworkers, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Almost tasted like thick cut, chewy bacon with goat cheese. 


Definitely will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Best of the best. The service here was totally unexpectedly awesome!  This was my third time here and management must have changed because the service was excellent. Not only was the service great  but the food was really good too.  We had the prime rib special for around $30 which included the salad the entry and a dessert. The prime rib was cooked to perfection and no one can beat the creamed spinach at Fleming's. We of course ordered the signature lava cake which is to die for. This place is a must try and reservations are highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this 4.5 stars and will explain why in a bit. 

Due to their recent promotion ($25 bill credit when you reserve online), my wife and I decided to go here for our annual end of year dinner.  We arrived on time for our reservation and were promptly seated at one of the raised booths in the back with a view of the kitchen.  Ambiance was great initially (we arrived on a Friday night at about 6) but then the restaurant started to fill up.  However, where we were sitting, it was not too noisy.  

For starters, the service was by far the best service we have had at any restaurant out here in Phoenix.  From the wait staff to the manager who came to our table, everyone was extremely polite.  

We started out with a bottle of wine recommended by our server (not one of the pricier ones) and it was excellent.  We shared a bowl of their crab/seafood chowder that was on special that night and that was excellent!  Tasted almost as good at New England Seafood chowder.  

My wife ordered the prix fixe special; 2 petite filets, scallops, wedge salad and dessert.  Everything was great but unfortunately the filets (ordered medium rare) came out medium, hence the reason for the .5 star.  A steakhouse should put out a perfectly cooked petite filet but unfortunately this one was left on the grill too long.  We did not complain nor send it back.  The flavor was still there.  I ordered the bone-in filet (on special) which was cooked perfectly and we got a side of Fleming's potatoes.  I was not too crazy about them as they tasted just like scalloped potatoes with a bit of jalapeno, but the wife liked them.

The chocolate lava cake was good although it was a little bland for my taste and may need a bit of sugar if it was served on its own. However, the ice cream, pistachios, and almond cookies give the extra sweetness.  

Again, great service and excellent wine selections.  I would recommend coming here for dinner and/or for happy hour as it seems like they have decent offerings in the bar area."}
{"text":"After hearing back from the owner Darrin my girlfriend and I decided to give Flemings another try. What an experience! From the time we walked in until the time we left the atmosphere was what you would expect from a steakhouse like this. The staff was very friendly and the food was amazing! Our hostess and waitress were great and made us feel very welcome. We ordered a ribeye and the filet and lobster with a side of mashed potatoes. The steaks were cooked to perfection. I ordered cheesecake for dessert at the recommendation of our waitress and it was incredible. 

I will definitely be coming back to Flemings very soon!"}
{"text":"I visited Flemings a lot this summer and the last two times were a big disappointment. The Sunday before Labor Day they ran a prime rib special 29.99, however the kitchen was over run with orders . It took an unreasonable amount of time to receive the meal.
On Labor Day made a reservation for 5 at 615 pm , well so did another 40 people. The operating partner Jeff Cronkite said the reservation system was in error, that it just kept allowing reservations to be made. Well after one hour sitting in the bar and a discussion with this man I left. I hope corporate can come in and straighten this place out obviously it's not up to Flemings standards ."}
{"text":"Great food. The steak, shrimp, and lobster was great.  


Our server Boyd was great. Very good server and checked in on us. 

The manager even stopped by to make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"this was my second experince at a Flemings and i am not gonna lie... i was not really lookign forward to it... but suprisingly it was GREAT... they have a great wedge and the prime rib i had was well cooked... my only cualm with it was that our server drove me nuts... i was there with a good family friend and i felt that every 5 minutes he was asking a question not to metion he messed up the order... but whatever... i will go back for the food... eventhough it is a chain steakhouse..."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at the bar...Joey and Dennis are the best."}
{"text":"The law firm I work for decided to have our Christmas dinner here this year since we had heard great things. They gave our party of 12 a private room. The setup was so intimate (tables set up in a square) and allowed us to be interactive throughout dinner. Our two servers, both names Amanda, were wonderful and attentive. 

We started with every single appetizer on the menu. They were all delicious!!! The wine selection was great and the cocktails deserve 5 stars in themselves. Dinner was delicious, very well seasoned and made. You MUST have dessert because it definitely makes for a perfect dinner

Overall our experience was great. We all enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. This location was great because it was in a small plaza that was decorated for the holidays. It was gorgeous and overall an amazing experience."}
{"text":"If you love steak this is the place for you! The incredible friendly service from the sweet hostess to the servers everyone gave top notch service! The filet was seasoned PERFECTLY and the most TENDER meat we have ever eaten!!! We had stuffed baked potato and calamari. The atmosphere is relaxing and very inviting. This place is great for a Special treat to go on a date or celebration."}
{"text":"We've been to Fleming's probably 50 times over the past several years.  Obviously we like this restaurant; the food, atmosphere and service.

I've written previous reviews but never one for Fleming's, which is my fault.  I've read the previous reviews and must admit this place wouldn't be highly recommended for vegetarians or vegans - it's primarily a steakhouse, by definition.  I rarely buy steak at home (because my doctors think I'm on a low-cholesterol diet), but I do love steak.  Fleming's has excellent steak, meat and fish dishes.  We've been to several Fleming's locations in the Phoenix area; they're all good. 
 
[Note:  The previous reviewer's comments are perhaps in the wrong location because they basically reviewed Paul Martin's American Grill.  Paul Martin's full name is Paul Martin Fleming.  His current restaurant is Paul Martin's but he has a long and successful history.  He created Fleming's Steakhouse but sold it years ago to Outback.  He also founded P.F. Chang's China Bistro (P.F. = Paul Fleming), Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill, and Pei Wei Asian Diner, all of which he sold.  As best I understand Paul Martin's is currently his only undertaking.  He was also formerly an investor and involved with Ruth's Steakhouse.] 

We absolutely love all their food.  They offer an absolutely fabulous \"happy hour\" with appetizer's and hamburgers (which isn't by any means hamburger), and discounted drinks.  What a great introduction to Fleming's for those that have never been here before.

One of the things we particularly like is their bread.  As soon as you sit down they bring you warm freshly baked bread with some wonderful spreads.  If you want more, just ask and they'll bring another small loaf, but be careful because if you eat too much you won't get through your meal.  We rarely order their \"sides\" because we're not big eaters, but they are all terrific.  The one thing I never pass up is their wedge salad; a wonderful salad.  On rare occasions we've had some of their desserts, which are fabulous, but fattening."}
{"text":"Now I know what everyone thinks, \"This is a chair restaurant, why are you bothering with a review?\" 
Well, two reasons, one they have amazing service and two - I ate the MOST outstanding burger since I moved to AZ.  I arrived at 6:30 - waiting patiently for my 2 friends who were leaving the country for good, a little goodbye party.  
My waitress was the sweetest person I had met and she really cared about her job and the tables she was dealing with.  I couldn't help but love her.  I ordered food and drink off the Happy Hour Menu - and let me stop here to explain this amazing situation: $5 food, martinis and wine - ARE YOU SERIOUS?  (as a heart attack)
Anyway I was still waiting on my very late friends and wanted to stick in their 2 drinks before happy hour ended - and the lovely waitress ordered them, but waited to bring them, because she doesn't want them to have warm drinks - Can you believe this amazing service? 
Lets move into the Burger, with peppered bacon and cheddar cheese.  Huge onion ring, and a little wedge for my burger.  I have no clue what sauce was served, but it was outstanding too.  I scarfed half the burger and could barely save the second half for my BFF (who still wasn't there).  The BBQ Shrimp, Calamari and Ahi Tuna all were amazing and I cannot rave enough. 

I really appreciate staff and the restaurants they work at that go that extra mile.  They easily could have made me pay full price for the additional 2 beverages, but they didn't and its those little gifts that earn a review like this and a pat on the back!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is totally remodeled 
Very modern but comfortable. Menu is tweaked for the better. A lot more options. Wine pours come in 3,6,9 ounces now. 
Ask for Tommy and or Vasily great waiters."}
{"text":"i tend to go here for there happy hour 5-7 mon- sun 6$ gets you a great shrimp app, carpaccio, burger ect excellant martinis and service"}
{"text":"Returned to Flemings again tonight after the bad experience in March and what a turn around! We had a very good experience...everything was really perfect. Super piece of Chilean Sea Bass and Waygu Strip Steak both cooked superbly after two interesting salads. 
We split an order of Fleming's potatoes, which was smart, otherwise we would not have had room for the Belgian chocolate lava cake.
Throw in a fine glass of Pinot Noir and a white blend from France called The Whip and we could hardly walk to our car. Overall, it really was a great dinner. One important component to tonight's dinner was the great service we received from Sara Flanigan our server. Thanks to her for the friendly and efficient service. 

Finally Thanks to Darrin Visser and his colleagues for stepping up and taking good care of us, this is what we have come to expect from Fleming's. 

Five stars tonight gang!"}
{"text":"Had a party of four here to celebrate a graduation.  The service was truly outstanding - from being seated immediately, to wine recommendations, to the presentation and great flavors of the food.  For special occasions, we would certainly come back."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was ok, but all in all, we prefer Ruth Chris. We were celebrating our birthdays and we had a gift card which is why we went to Flemings."}
{"text":"There are so many better options in Scottsdale.  I took guests to Fleming's because it is proximate to the Hilton Village center.  Even though it's a chain I thought it would be a decent experience.  I was wrong.

We got stuck in the back room with crying babies everywhere (it was 8:00 pm).  And our server only seemed interested in turning over our table.  We had requested a table in the front but we were told all booths were reserved.  As we were leaving, we walked past the same two empty booths that we saw as we were coming in.  

Not worth $500 to eat in a cafeteria setting."}
{"text":"Noisy at happy hour, the Salt and Pepper Shrimp (on their appetizer menu) was really a shrimp tempura served with a creamy mayonnaise type sauce.  Not to my taste.  This is no reflection on their dinners which may be fine."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the $8 Prime Burger in the bar til 7pm smothered with cheddar cheese and topped with bacon. Had it twice in less than a week it was so good and juicy. Properly cooked to my medium rare liking. Good attentive fast service. in & out in less than 40 minutes"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great here at this restaurant....However you can tell they are part of a big chain working to cut costs where they can.....We tried dinner there last night....The Filet was very dry for med rare ....I have had better on my own grill purchased from a local grocery.....The shrimp cocktail is supposed to be huge shrimp as an appetizer for $17.00 and these were quite small, .the kind you would find commonly anywhere. with no flavor...The single loaf of bread was cold and the outside of it was not crispy....The butter options were good though....My other half enjoyed the salmon and it was cooked perfectly...Overall for the price of dinner, I would not go back....HOWEVER I would do happy hour there again.....The happy hour menu is good and the prices are great.... I DO WANT TO SAY THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT ARE IMPECCABLE....TRAINED WELL AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INSURE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST IT CAN BE....."}
{"text":"My hotels concierge recommended this establishment.  A point of caution to my fellow travelers; always be cautious of recommendations from your concierge, some have an interest in recommending certain places. I cannot say this happened in this case but if I had read Yelp I would not have dined here. 

When I called they said, \"We strongly recommend reservations\" so I did. When I arrived the place was barely  1/2 full. There was clearly no need for reservations (red flag). The ambiance is definitely classy, dark interior with perfectly placed linens and tableware. I wouldn't expect anything less for this area of Scottsdale. My server was new (\"What kind of vodka would you like in your Mojito?\"). Anyway, she was a sweetheart with a good sense of humor....and painfully slow. 

My steak medallions wrapped on bacon were good (the special that night). For the price they should be spectacular and a healthy portion. They were not. The menu is √† la carte, I wasn't too hungry so just opted for a wedge salad which by its nature is nothing exciting. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was delicious and a large portion.  

The final total for two diners with drinks was $243. It comes in at a solid three stars and a solid ho- hum experience.  The place gives off the impression they are a Rolls Royce but it's really a Ford in attractive wrapping."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner. The service was impeccable. Server Sarah H was terrific in every way. The seafood tower was once again a dream dinner. The staff was great couldn't have been nicer. This is how a restaurant should be. Even got a box of truffles from Sara as a birthday gift and a gift card from one of the managers, perfect night."}
{"text":"Fleming's is definitely a special occasion place but well worth it. The service was very professional and attentive. The food was very well prepared, just the way we ordered it. I felt that everyone made the effort to make the experience the best that it could be. My husband ordered the peppercorn steak which was cooked just right while I had the small plate of lamb chops. They were wonderful. The Fleming's potatoes are hot to the table and so yummy. A great evening out."}
{"text":"Went this weekend on sat night for the first time. We joined a group for a birthday dinner of total of 8 people. Waitress took everyones drink order and never asked me or my bf. Then after a while I asked a lady filling our waters that I wanted a drink and my bf wanted a beer and that we have been waiting to give our food orders. Finally got my drink but had to ask again for my bf beer. Food finally got ordered and of course im not surprised it took forever to Come out. Food surprised us all on how small it was from how the waiter explained it. Got the chefs special which I can say tasted so good but was a very small amount for the price. Lava cake was delicious! Over all the service was bad for a pricey place that that. Im giving 3 stars for how good the food was. I wouldn't recommend or go back"}
{"text":"A group of four dined here on Sunday evening for the Prime Rib special. A great deal if everything is good including the service. On this evening the service was slow... our dinner took 2 1/2 hours from start to finish. No bread for the first 30 minutes even after asking. Requested the wedge salads be chopped before bringing out and they were not. My wife found a hair in the Prime Rib which ruined her evening. Overall, a big disappointment but the desserts were excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Even though the location is at DC Ranch, my wife and I take the 15 minute drive and always do our splurge dinners here. Last night was our 36th anniversary and Eric our waiter was great. Sunday, prime rib night is one of our favorites, as it is the best value. My bone-in rib eye was the best I have ever had and as always my wifes prime rib was delicious and cooked medium-rare to perfection. Excellent spot for H/H too with the 5/6/7 promotion."}
{"text":"You'll find phenomenal steaks and yummy sides in a comfortable atmosphere at Fleming's in the DC Ranch area of Scottsdale. Our server and the manager were friendly and attentive, however we were brought incorrect beverages by a very rude second server...so rude that it nearly ruined our whole experience. That situation will make me a little gun shy about trying this Fleming's location again. If it weren't for that, I would have given a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Their happy hour specials in the bar make Fleming's prices palatable. Though you may have to wait for a table, it is well worth it.

Their $7 hamburger and fries happy hour special is FANTASTIC. A juice prime beef patty cooked just the way you like it (even medium rare, if you are so inclined!). The huge patty is served on a roll, with lettuce, tomato and your choice of cheese. Pickles are only by request, why??

Happy Hour beers on tap are a great way to round out a cheap and fantastic meal at Fleming's during happy hour!

If you can find a seat on the patio, you can sit near their open fireplace. 

Their main menu is ala carte everything... steak, potato, salad, side dish...
The steaks are great and the side potatoes are huge."}
{"text":"We have been to this Fleming's many times for dinner and happy hour.  They were always top notch.  Yesterday we were there with friends and the food was less than acceptable.  I ordered the well martinis and was over charged.  There was no adjustment on this only a lame explanation.  We order the prime hamburger plate.  The burger was hard as a hockey puck, very little cheese and the fries were cold and limp.  I have had the exact order before and it was very good.  It will be a long time if ever that I will return to flemings.
I was contacted by Fleming's after my complaint.  They wanted to make this right by offering us complimentary hamburgers and 2 martinis to make up for the bad happy hour experience.  Hopefully this will be a better experience"}
{"text":"I have never had such a great experience. My husband and I came here for our anniversary and not only was the food INCREDIBLE, the service was out of this world. Heather was our server and she took amazing care of us with great recommendations and the most fantastic attitude! I recommend the chocolate lava cake but order it at the beginning as it takes a while to cook. Colleen stopped by as well and was so accommodating and friendly. The staff here made our special night absolutely perfect. I really couldn't be happier. If you're looking for great food and the best, personable staff, this is the place. :)"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Never a disappointment there. Service however needs some work. We came the day before Valentine's Day and were very disappointed with service. When ordering $150 wine, you would hope the server would come by every once in awhile to pour it for you. Or at least check up on you! We never saw her after we ordered. And poured our own wine. I don't even want to imagine her service when it was crowded on Valentine's Day!!!

We came 2 or 3 weeks later to give it another try. We had a reservation, however it \"wasn't ready\" so we waited 25min...what was the point of a reservation?? Service was a little better, but still not the service you would except and that we usually receive at a prime steakhouse restaurant.

I hate to take away 2 stars for the same reason, but we give it two tries....

All other Flemings I have been to have had 5 star service, they need to retrain at this location!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it. They made us feel special."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the steakhouse, & I have to say I won't be our last. We don't normally like going to the same place as when we do more expensive meals because we like to try the different cuisines throughout the city. The service was great, the manager was phenomenal, and the food was very very good. It definitely lives up to its name."}
{"text":"I'll be forthright! I'm not a fan of Fleming's 3 bad experiences in three different cities. They have redeemed themselves in this visit. Everything and I mean everything was perfect! Mashed Potatoes, Corn, Asparagus and the Ribeye was delicious and flavorful. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I normally don't patronize these high end steak places since that's not how I roll. But I decided to get out and live a little by taking advantage of one of those dinner seminar evenings put on by some financial types that were hoping to manage my money.

The wait staff balanced about twenty entrees on their arms and deliver the meals with such professionalism. Okay, I might be exaggerating a little bit on the number of plates that they balance on their arms. 

My Filet Mignon was very tasty. Just the right amount of pepper and juiciness. Pretty much like how I cook them on my grill. The green beans and mashed potatoes were excellent. Although, the mashed potato portion was a bit slim.

I'm definitely a fan of Fleming's steakhouse."}
{"text":"Went here on New Years Eve this year. Place was fantastic. The support staff kinda sucked, but our waiter made up for their flaws. Excellent filet!"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant often, the interior and exterior atmosphere is incredible unfortunately the stakes are hit-and-miss, we have had great experience and then again had a bad experience.
Manager always always makes up for a bad experience but I can only give them a 3-star rating."}
{"text":"Completely enjoyed a post Thanksgiving meal here in the private room with our large group of 12.  Everyone raved about the various steak dishes they ordered and the sides are delicious!

My barbecue salmon was a little fishy for my taste which means it's not as fresh as it could be, but acceptable.  What do you expect when you go to a steak house and order the fish? If it had been a little fresher I would have nothing to complain about.  The serving size was enough for two like most of their steaks and the house salad is fabulous.

I'd go back and I would stick to the steaks, salad and sides.  

I have to say I loved our waiter and all the staff here is top notch."}
{"text":"We live close to Flemings. We have tried it 3 times and have had horrific experiences.  The latest being today Easter Sunday.  We arrived at 1:10 brunch ran till 3 - after complaint we finally were served at 2:50!   In addition we ordered an omelet, overdone and clearly sitting out, fingerling potatoes that never arrived, filet with porcini topping and broccoli I, filet served cold, no broccoli And when asked for the potatoes, they were mashed- sent them back and finally 5 minutes before \"brunch \" being over they said they ran out.  Really?  If you would have served us 45 min ago- maybe not????  we have had two similar experiences but were silly enough to try again!  What a waste of money and time!  Never again when there are so many other steak houses above and beyond... Get your management staff together/- otherwise charge appropriately...Arby's?"}
{"text":"So this is the place to go when my family and I want to dress up all fancy smancy. It's become an even greater event for the Williams clan since they have their entire menu gluten free! 

I can order the exact same thing as I always do without having to suffer! WIN! As you are seated just ask for their gluten free menu and they will gladly give you the Flemings gluten free menu- an actual menu not some flimsy piece of paper. (As silly as this sounds I always feel embaressed having to order when I am thought as a spectacle) When they serve the bread and delicious champange goat cheese (ahhh so  amazing) they will gladly serve you cut veggies instead! I have never had a poor meal here trying the beautiful steaks, poultry and seafood. And for all the lovely people who can eat gluten still you must order the shoestring potatoes- they cross contaminate their friers so a no no for GF!  The service is fantastic and I have never had a bad meal here!

The creme brule and berries with cream are a must as a gluten free desert!"}
{"text":"went for restaruant week.
absolutely fantastic.
the filet mijon was so moist and rich, not overly seasoned.
the creme brulee was the perfect way to end my meal. 
the staff are very professional and friendly. 
atmosphere compliements the entire experience.
i hear they have an amazing happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"I want to have every meal of the day here!

This was my first experience with Flemings and it won't be my last! 
The padres and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived, we had the restaurant to our selves and settled in on our second table (my mom didn't like the first one) which was a comfy horseshoe shaped booth in the corner. I perused the wine list, which is on one of those fancy iPads, and choose a yummy Zinfandel that appeared before me in no time! 

I was trying to eat healthy and started with the Fleming's salad (candied walnuts and  cranberries!) and then had the New Bedford Scallops that were perfectly cooked and accompanied with a delicious lemon-honey glaze (my mouth is salavating as I write this). My mom was super boring and I honestly dont remember what she ordered, but she enjoyed it. My Dad, however, loved his dish that they only serve one day a week. On Sunday's they offer a prime rib special that includes a appetizer salad, two sides, and a dessert...you need to come on Sundays. This was one of the best prime ribs he as ever in the 35+ years he has been living in Arizona. For his/my sides he ordered the saut√©ed mushrooms and the BLUE CHEESE mashed potatoes! Everything was incredibly tasty and I still had my Dad's dessert to devour! 

For dessert, my Dad ordered the Carrot cake, BUT, my mom mentioned earlier that I was recently engaged and in addition to the carrot cake (which was amazing, the spice was so delicious and the cake itself was incredibly fresh and moist) we got to indulge in the super gooey Chocolate melted volcano cake (I couldn't stop eating the creamy center filled with chocolate sauce and I am NOT a chocolate person), the refreshing Pistachio ice cream with a yummy tuile (that's a fancy name for a buttery walffald/cookie/cone, thanks Andrea for helping me with my \"classy\" lessons), and, my favorite, the light, yet dense creme brulle...ugh, so good! Oh, and since they knew I was watching my figure, we also got to try their house made whipped cream that you could eat as a dessert on its own!

The food was fantastic and the serivce...more fantastical (even when the restaurant started to fell up)! From the friendly hostess who greeted us, to Adam, the server's assistant, to the BEST WAITRESS EVER, Andrea, and even the manager, Jessica, all were extremely friendly and really seemed to care about how our dining experience turned out. 

Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"FAN-FREAKIN' -TASTIC!

Yes, it's a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service.

Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.

I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)

The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.

The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)

Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out."}
{"text":"We arrived at the Hilton tired and hungry after a long day at work and traveling.  The front desk recommended Flemings and we can't be happier with that decision. The menu is amazing and the wine selection is one of the best I have seen. The filets were prepared to our desire and cut like butter almost melting in your mouth. The staff was fantastic and we would go back every time we are in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Amazing steak , great wine, service was excellent 
The food was OMG so delicious and perfect!"}
{"text":"Top notch steakhouse. Excellent service - over the top actually with about 5 different people stopping by the table calling me by last name and filling water glasses on time, serving and taking away food immediately, checking in to ask if all was OK. I can't remember that last time I experienced such top notch service - spot on. Food - we all ordered steaks that were cooked perfectly - sides are ordered separately and are quite large - example the potato I ordered loaded was the size of regulation football - I easily could have split this monster with the wife. Couple of notes: pricing on the high side - would only stop in here for a special occasion, wine pouring per glass was less than I expected, noise level in the place can get loud - not  a deal breaker - however this should be mentioned - overall from start to finish they get A's in my book."}
{"text":"Excellent service last night for my family's Christmas dinner. Server was more than helpful and our food came out at a decent time and it was all cooked to perfection . Manager even gave me a free desert, I will Definitely be revisiting this restaurant in the near future!"}
{"text":"I had the Tbone last time and it was amazing. Ordered several sides, and was disappointed.  I guess you go for the steaks and not the sides."}
{"text":"We went with a party of 10. The greeting was perfect, great environment and wonderful service. I tried the chef's special which was 3 different cuts of filet. I wasn't a fan of the wellington, but everything else was great"}
{"text":"Very solid all around.  We had a very nice meal here, the highlight of which was definitely the steaks.  I had a new york strip medium rare, which was perfectly cooked, and also very well seasoned.  You don't need much more than that, but that's what you need.  The chipotle cheddar mac and cheese was also spectacular - smoky with a bit of heat and nicely coated in thick creamy cheesy deliciousness.

Not quite as stellar: the creamed spinach was a little too creamy, being basically more cream than spinach.  Also, the seafood tower; it had some pretty excellent items  like the jumbo shrimp and the king crab leg, but it was extremely light on the lobster and the lump crab salad was bland and subpar.

A couple other notes: They have some really tasty homemade butter spreads they serve with the breadbasket.  The place looks great inside, and the service was excellent with the only hiccup being a long wait for our first cocktail.  My only other complaint would be the wine list; there are plenty of bottles in the $30-40 range but most of them are from the cheap aisle at your grocery store.  You're gonna have to shell out $50+ to find something that really stands up to your red meat."}
{"text":"I am seriously craving those little toasts with the two kinds of spreadable cheese they bring you before your meal at Flemmings right now.  DEAR GOD do you think you can get that to go?

I have had a fantastic experience every time I've been to Flemmings.  Great, sophisticated atmosphere with waiters who know their food and their wine.  Great wine selection, btw.  

I always have the filet there and its always cooked to perfection, along with the asparagus and blue cheese mashed potatos...holy crap--DELISH.  

Great upscale date place...I've also seen groups handled well here too."}
{"text":"Been coming to flemings forever now, in different states too. We'v had some great meals and not so good meals lately, the last time we came here it was medicore. We hope they improve more instead of going down hill. Would be nice see some more changes like it used to be a few years ago. overall its pretty decent at times."}
{"text":"We were celebrating an anniversary of a family member.  I can say that the bus boys were better at service than our waitress.  We had started the evening ordering drinks an I was looking forward to the calamari appetizer I ordered through our waitress. She proceeded to take our orders salads came no appetizer then out food came   Food was awesome however my husband didn't get any melted butter with his crab legs. We kept waiting then finally my husband got up and found our waitress and asked for melted butter    We then told her make sure we are not charged for the calamari she acted as though she was surprised we didn't get it.  Anyways I was really disappointed in our waitress.  The rest of the staff was the service for us.   We still tipped at 15 percent when I will tell you I'm a solid 20 percent tipper. Food fabulous.  Waitress needs some training."}
{"text":"You want over priced food with neglectful staff, this is your place. I got the gift card from costco as a gift, so I thought what the heck why not? So me and my wife dress up for an awesome night. We get there and sit at the bar, since we made reservations and they werent ready for us. So we grab a drink, the bartenders are awesome.  30 mins later we get a table, why make a reservation? The stick us at a table in the corner where it seemed really dark. Maybe I was being punished?  Little did I know....
The waiter rarely came around, he was more concerned with the tables with fancy suited men with young women. After around 40 mins we put our order in. With the prices they had this must be the best steak I have ever had, right? Wrong! This small sliver of peppered meat was far from what I expected. I get better steaks from the market. After our waiter comes for the 3rd time during our 90 mins waiting, he was too busy taking pictures for those wealthy looking people, I get the check dropped on me and no questions on how the food was, or if we needed anything. Word to the wise, you want the waiters to recognize you, wear expensive suits and bring some ladies, you will be treated like a King.

Needless to say, this establishment will never get my business again."}
{"text":"We came for Happy Hour.  Our server was attentive and the burgers we ordered were cooked to perfection along with homemade potatoes strings. I wish the wine by the glass menu was broader, but we had a very nice time. Food menu is enticing and value priced.  Well worth going!"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour with 5 wines, 5 cocktails, and 5 apps, each for $6.  My pal and I went with the sweet chile calamari and the mushroom ravioli and were not disappointed with either.

Fleming's is still on my list for dinner, but in the meantime, happy hour will do just fine."}
{"text":"I wanted crab cakes, lobster bisque and a steak, so I \"settled\" for Flemings because it had all the above. I ended up only getting the crab cakes and the steak, and both were outstanding. The crab cakes were cooked perfectly with lots of meat and had some kind of sauce underneath that really complimented the appetizer well. My steak was cooked at a perfect medium-rare plus, and didn't require any extra sauce or seasoning, and I ordered a lobster with it that was cooked perfectly and huge in size. I was obviously hungry...lol.

Brandon was my server and the manager came to my table periodically just to check and see how everything was going. My experience was wonderful and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really good, consistent, high quality steaks.  But I'm ahead of myself.  

Quick service at the desk, found our reservations and quickly off to the table.  Attentive, but not obnoxious waiter.  Gold star there for well trained  staff.  

Carpaccio was excellent, wife's calamari was perfect, not overcooked, just crunchy little pillows of tasty, tender, seafood.

Peppercorn steak, for a change and perfectly cooked rare, tender and succulent.  Just enough peppercorn to bring a little heat and tang to the steak, She had the salmon, also tender and perfectly cooked.  

Too full for dessert, but we did have espresso. 

Well worth the price, enjoy"}
{"text":"I also meant to add that they have special event dinners as well as a Friday night special and a winter prix fix for only $39! It's nice to know I have the option to eat have my steak and eat it too."}
{"text":"Did not like my filet. I couldn't cut it...It was about 2 inches thick, burnt and dry on the 1cm perimeter and raw in the center....I had ordered it \"medium\". Strongly suggest they buy better meat and reevaluate their cooking methods. 

The service was great and it's in a beautiful dining room attached to some hotel, I wasn't sure what the name was.

Even though it was a lovely dinner, I'm still a little upset I couldn't eat the filet :/"}
{"text":"Fleming's knows service, food and ambiance and they excel in all three. I have been to other Fleming's before, but just recently dined at this location. It's a perfect option in the DC Ranch option for a nice dinner out. From the outside, it looks like they don't have a patio, but they actually do and it's a good one because it's covered so it's not as hot in the summer. 

However, we dined inside during this visit and enjoyed the cozy atmosphere. The service at this Fleming's was excellent and the server paid very close attention to our requests, especially my pregnant request for very well done salmon. I enjoyed a Cesar salad followed by the BBQ salmon and thoroughly enjoyed both, especially the BBQ salmon. I highly recommend ordering it if you feel like something other than steak. However, the steaks are also delicious and I stole a bite of the Filet which was delicious as well. For dessert, I highly recommend the carrot cake. It is fresh and amazing! The frosting is delicious and the cake is perfectly moist. 

This was a nice dining experience and I definitely look forward to returning and especially taking advantage of their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I love love love their Happy Hour 5 for 6 until 7 seven days a week! They change up the happy hour menu a few times a year, but you could never go wrong! My first time at this particular location and I enjoyed the ambiance and the great customer service! This location also had an IPad wine menu that paired your meal with particular wines! It was pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Fleming's was great !  We just came from Houston's down the street which was awful.  At Fleming's the Appetizers were wonderful, great selection, and friendly service (especially Nichole).  Thank you !  A little on the pricey side, but still worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for thanksgiving this year and the food and drink were great! It was busy so we sat on the patio which was pleasant. The service was kinda slow and I expected
More from Flemings. It's the little things that count.....like filling up water glasses and asking if you  red anything else."}
{"text":"Relatives from Nevada visited and had a hankering for the Winter Prix Fixe Menu.  We arrived with a reservation and were fortunate to be seated at a high table in the patio overlooking a gorgeous sunset. Three of us had ordered the filet mignon vigneron  with a side of grilled asparagus and then found out we could substitute blue cheese lettuce wedge for the Caesar salad. We all opted for the delicious blue cheese salad and cleaned our plates.  I don't normally eat steak but the filet was very tasty and a welcome change from chicken and fish.

For desert the prix fixe menu listed ice-cold milk and cookies.  It turned out that wasn't necessary either and we had several choices. Here we departed ways with one ordering a chocolate lava cake and another ordering the frozen lemon gingersnap pie.  Due to the peanut scare the chocolate peanut butter sandwich was dropped and substituted with a very delicious cheese cake with blueberry sauce.  Definitely a good substitution and more than enough for sharing with the fourth light-eater who only ordered a very large pork chop.  The light-eater still had half the pork chop left over for a doggie bag and next meal."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times now.  My first time was  forgettable.  The few things I remember was nobody was there, and I had filet.  Oh and it was expensive.

Don't know why I came back but I did.  And then I came back again.  Service was great.  My drinks were great.  My filet cooked medium was great. The calamari appetizer great.  The chocolate lava cake, Awsome.

Overall, its a great place.  But for the price, I want amazing.  I will be back though. Only becuase it is conveniently located."}
{"text":"I came here for a free dental CE which in and of itself was amazing. Flemming's has a nice private room so we could here the speaker well, (downs for hosting, a little trouble with the lights and watch for next door clickers taking over your screen). The food was fabulous. Shrimp cocktail, interesting butters and bread, red onion walnut cranberry salad:  pretty standard. Then things became interesting. My favorite kind of mac and cheese coating in panko bread crumbs, perfectly cooked and seasoned asparagus, and melt in your mouth filet mignon. I did not think I would be able to eat another bite but out came a huge slice of I believe white chocolate cheesecake with a berry sauce. Amazing! I wanted more sauce but that was not enough to stop me from cleaning my plate. Why isn't there free CE's with fantastic dinners that allow over eager dental students every night???"}
{"text":"Came to Fleming's after not visiting for many years. We have always loved coming here. Upon seating they gave us a tablet that contained the drink menu, which I think is a great idea because you get a visual of what some of their cocktails look like. After ordering they bring out their bread that comes with 2 different butters that are to die for.  The menu is what you would expect from a steakhouse, but I still enjoyed every bite. I started with the shrimp cocktail and then a filet w/ a side of b√©arnaise sauce. I think my favorite part was the Fleming's Potatoes, the jalape√±os give it a great taste but the good news for those who aren't into spicy is that it is mild.  Finished off my meal with the carrot cake, which was by far my favorite dessert there.
    The reason for our visit was to celebrate my husbands birthday, so during the meal they surprised us with a $25 gift card. Great touch as it makes you feel special and almost guarantees them that you will return to dine again. Win-win for everyone. My husbands favorite  part was at the end of our meal they gave him a box of 4 truffles to take home. He said that they were delicious, which I am assuming to be true as he wouldn't share them with me. 
   I would like to add that we also had our 9 month old with us and they were so friendly with him even when he did make a mess on the floor. They even came to specifically see how he was enjoying his pieces of steak, as it was his first filet ever."}
{"text":"Another great Happy Hour! The selection of dishes was very nice. The calamari was delish and the burger was huge and very good. The drinks very strong- the definitely don't skimp on the alcohol just because its happy hour. 

The bar area was crowded, so I would recommend getting there early for Happy Hour. Sit at the bar, you will meet some really interesting people!"}
{"text":"A friend and I are on a quest to find the best steak in the Valley, so every time we meet for dinner, we choose a different steak place to try. Our visit to Fleming's was far below my expectations. 

I had heard wonderful things about Fleming's for their happy hour, and, indeed, the happy hour has some great options. I'll return for that. Service was decent; we remained at the bar. And there was a fantastic wine selection with reasonable prices. 

However, when it comes to steak: mine was overcooked (I ordered it medium) and not sufficiently trimmed (I got a filet). Sides were unmemorable."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the quality of the food is amazing! My husband and I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"first time here.  lifelong weekly mortons eater and this place was alright.  i enjoyed the wine selection and the steak.  the service was good and nothing to complain about either.  the food was prepared quickly and correct.  kudos!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, very elegant, and the food is impeccable.  Have been there several times, and have never been disappointed.  Can't swear to the entire menu though, I go there for the steak, and it is wonderful.  Wine list is very nice."}
{"text":"Must admit that we visit Fleming's at least 6 times a year and we are never disappointed. Last night at the Scottsdale DC location on a busy New Years Eve they again met and surpassed our expectations. Our server Christian was excellent in every way, Chris the manager checked in often to wish me a happy birthday as well as to see if all was well. We had the steak and lobster special which was superb in every way. It's comforting to know that you can return to an upscale restaurant and seemingly never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night we had the most delicious and delightful family birthday dinner ever!  When I made the reservation for nine people, including a high chair, the representative suggested we might like one of the private dining rooms.  What a terrific idea!  

The room was set with a big square table so we could all see one another, lots of room around it for the little one to visit us.  They encouraged me to pre-order a couple appetizers to share.  I chose 2 fresh seafood towers and what an amazing treat they were!  Beautiful presentation of lobster, shrimp, crab eggs and snow crab claws, with delicious accompanying sauces.  Yum!

We all ordered our favorite entrees, with sides to share, and loved every dish.  One of my daughters is vegan so our server, Matt, took the time to consult the chef ensuring no dairy or meat was used in her meal preparation.  I'm very impressed with the attention he paid to her special requests.  Even the kids meals were sumptuous, especially including the 'Amuse Boucher ' of sliced apples with caramel dipping sauce.  Wow!  

Chocolate lava cake to share was the perfect ending to a perfect dining experience, topped only by the lovely box of birthday truffles.  I cannot imagine a more perfect meal or setting in which to enjoy it.  

Thank you, Flemings, for another fantastic special occasion."}
{"text":"I'm spoiled...I'm used to Fleming's in San Diego where I've had great experiences.  Not so here and we were celebrating my wife's birthday.  And not because of the service...everyone was nice.  The food was not good, not for Fleming's. The steak came rare when we ordered medium...the expediter must have grabbed the wrong steak. The sauces were cold. The white wine was room temperature.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"We love surf & turf!  I mean who doesn't enjoy an extremely well prepared Filet Mignon accompanied with a succulent lobster tail? Oh Yeah!  So of course we had to go pay Fleming's a visit with some good friends.  We go to Fleming's for their steak because they know how to prepare it better than most!  

For starters we were treated to a warm, rosemary loaf of bread.  The bread was already very good by itself, but the butters were even better.  I don't remember what each butter flavor was but I liked them both.  I preferred the orange (sun dried tomato maybe?) looking one.  The white one had a bit of a feta cheese taste to it.  We quickly polished off our whole loaf of bread.  Shortly after that, our soups and salads arrived, nothing special to write about here.

Next came our steak and lobster.  The server waited while we cut into our steaks to make sure that it was cooked to the precise way we had requested.  My lovely bride's steak was so small it looked as though it was meant to be on a tasting spoon and not part of a surf & turf. The server apologized and was embarrassed he had not noticed it prior to bringing it to our table and quickly sent for another one.  My steak was perfectly cooked, mid-rare but I could have used a bit more seasoning.  The lobster tail was the highlight for my meal. The lobster came out served on top of its tail shell, but then it was removed by the waiter, (as if I could not handle it on my own :-) The lobster was not at all dry, which I worried about.  It was moist, tender, and was pure lobster deliciousness!

As we dug into our steaks, we were given sides of asparagus and Fleming's potatoes.  I found the asparagus to be seasoned and cooked very well but a bit overly oily.  The Fleming's potatoes were like layers of lasagna, covered in a creamy sauce.  I've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish, but this was exceptionally good.  

For the finale we had Chocolate Lava Cake ~ a rich chocolate cake with a hot molten chocolate center, served with vanilla ice cream and sweet crisp wafers. The warm hot molten center with a scoop of the cool vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end this wonderful meal.

Fleming's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple, family or with good friends.  They are a chain, but they know how to cook steak very well and they are consistent. They have an exceptional wine list, which is what I recommend. Their well drinks are a too pricey (vodka & water X 2 = $24) so stick with wine."}
{"text":"I went there with my family and in-laws to celebrate 2 birthdays and an anniversary.  Food was good.  Then when they brought the check, we noticed they charged my father-in-law $25.00 for each of his house bourbon drinks.  The waitress defended the charge at first, then came back and admitted their register was programmed incorrectly.  We then had to wait 30 MINUTES for them to bring back the correct check.  Making us wait so they could correct their  error was bad judgement on their part.  We used to go there a few times a year... think we will make Eddie V's our regular now."}
{"text":"Our most recent Fleming's visit brought us to the Scottsdale location. I had called a couple hours in advance to check on their expected availability and the hostess was a step ahead, offering to help me set a reservation. Once we arrived, all the service was excellent. McKenna, our server, was perfect. Friendly, warm, professional -- of course the food was great but service like hers is what made this a worthwhile outing. 

We had a couple drinks, the calamari (good -- on the sweet side but that is how they advertise it), loaded baked potato, steaks, lobster tail, and the lava cake (GET THE LAVA CAKE IT IS TOO MUCH BUT YOU'LL BE SO GLAD YOU DID!). Everything was great. Honestly, I was actually a little surprised because chain places tend to slip somewhere but Fleming's was on point."}
{"text":"Met a gal pal there for happy hour the other day.   In fact, it was on a Monday; therefore, thought it would be \"slow.\"   No!  It was packed!   HH is only in the bar and patio, and when we got there at 6:00, the only reason we got a place to sit was cause some people got up and left.   Otherwise, what?  

Even though the place was packed, we could have a decent conversation without shouting at each other, which I appreciate the acoustics.

Hannah was our server and I can't remember who assisted her.   Both very efficient and professional.  

I had the 14 Hands cab on the HH menu.   Most HH wine is UGHHHH!!! and I usually end up getting something to drink off the non HH menu.  The 14 Hands was good.  In fact, good enough that I looked to see if it was sold in town.   It is. And it is inexpensive.  And, yes, I shall buy it.  We perused the HH bar food.  Hmmm.  Both of us were hungry; therefore, we both had the burger and shoestring fries.   The beef patty came topped with two yummy strips of bacon and a slice of tomato and enough iceberg lettuce for a salad.  We both put our buns aside and ate the burger, bacon, and salad/tomato and lettuce.   

The burger was, well, a burger.   Nothing special about it.   The shoestring fries were, well, shoestring fries.   It was good.  

I would go back to try their other food.   If it was based only on the burger and fries, I'd give it three stars.   With the atmosphere of being able to hold a conversation without shouting and the efficiency and friendliness of our server and her helper, and the fact they don't have some sort of cheap rot gut wine on the HH menu, I'll give it a four.   I think they should be more creative with their fries.  The other option was onion rings.   I saw what appeared to be two huge onion rings on other guests' plates, and I am assuming that was the onion rings.   No, thank you. ..."}
{"text":"Uhm, I can't believe I haven't written a review on Fleming's!!!!

I first brought my then-bf (now fiance!) to Fleming's to celebrate his birthday - we ordered the petite filet and the beef wellington (which sadly, I must say, they no longer offer) - and got a FREE chocolate lava cake. pretty sure that thing has a fancier name, but at any rate - simply put, the BEST chocolate cake i've ever had. you MUST try this!

in return, my fiance brought me back to fleming's after winning a gift card at an office holiday party for a date - we ordered the surf&turf special - scallop risotto and beef medallions, the lamb chops (i am totally drooling just thinking about them!), and a side of Fleming's house potatoes. 

Ok, so we know that Fleming's beef is crazy-awesome, but the lamb chops? I have never had a better chop in my life. If you like lamb, you will loooooove this stuff. and the fleming's potatoes? probably 1 million and 2 calories in 1 cheese-laden/jalapeno-spiked bite, but hello!, totally worth it.  The medallions were quite tasty, and the scallops/risotto was superb. but nothing could even touch the lamb. seriously."}
{"text":"If given the opportunity to go out to a great steak restaurant, come here. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed. I recommend the fillet mignon to anyone who wants a delicious tender treat.  A little known option for the true fillet enthusiast is a preparation called \"Oscar Style\" that con sits of Bearnaise sauce mixed with crab meat, that covers the luscious fillet (it's about $10 more but well worth it).  

Another little known fact is that every Sunday evening Fleming's has a \"Prime Rib Special\" for $30 per person that includes a salad, a side, a piece of prime rib, and a dessert. This is by far the best deal in upper class restaurant history. If you were to order everything separate it would be around $60 per person.  So if you want to splurge for a nice Sunday dinner without the splurging please do not miss out.

The only thing is that since this is a prime steakhouse the steaks come out a little bit on the rare side so if you can't decide between medium and medium-well Felming's will prepare a steak in between if you ask for \"medium plus.\""}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town!  carpaccio and burgers are out of this world!!!  Great service which is typical of all of Flemings. Friendly, accomodating and spot on.  Always a great atmosphere whether in the dining room or the bar. Love this place!!! Scottsdale, Tucson or anywhere! You know what your going to get!"}
{"text":"Kind of an older crowd here and the bar is always packed.  I was here for an anniversary dinner and we all had a good time.

Service was very attentive and the food was good. Our bone-in ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare.  The Fleming's potatoes have a nice little kick and the creamed spinach brussels sprouts rounded out a satisfying meal.

They also have an extensive wine list.  We had a nice Justin red blend that went great with the steaks and didn't break the bank at $78 for a bottle."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in their happy hour.  Mostly older folks and the bar is full by 5:15 pm.  The burger was really weak.  Hopdoddy, Zinburger and other places have much better burgers.

The chocolate lava cake was very good.

Also, I had a $50 gift card and they made me use the whole thing if I wanted to pay for my $35 bill with the card.  That's right, I wasted $15 on my gift card because I really don't care to come back."}
{"text":"I wish I had 4 hands so I could give this place 4 thumbs up! Great service from Paul and delicious food. Especially the lobster mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Its been well over a year since we've been here but this chain has never failed to satisfy!  The double pork chop that i had was fantastic!  I had the porcini mushroom sauce on the side and OMG!  Such a great combo with the chop!  And actually they bring an inhouse made bread with 2 different types of spreads and one of them was a brie cheese with champagne and just thinking about gives me goosebumps!  Unfortunately, i have to cut this review short but the creme Brule is also to die for!  The only reason why i didnt give it a 5 star is that they sat us under a ac grate and it was too cold sitting BUT the manager did take care of that.  Great job Flemings!"}
{"text":"WOW !!! My wife & I had our annual birthday dinner @ the Fleming's on N. Scottsdale Rd & Lincoln Dr.  What a treat !  My wife had the sea bass..delicious in every respect.....my choice: the Prime Rib Sunday Special......extra good !  We couldn't have had a nicer time, thanks to the attentive management & courteous staff. Needless to say, we'll be back...."}
{"text":"I decide to treat myself to dinner and I choose Fleming's as I had heard great things about this place. Wow! That is the best way to describe my experience here tonight. From the moment I walked in until the moment I left was great. Nick, my server was fantastic and attentive without being overbearing. Dillon, Nick's \"assistant\" was a sweetheart and the Manager Mark was awesome. 

I ordered the prime rib special they currently have going on and it came without  salad, main course with a side as well as a dessert for $29.95. I like the end piece of the prime rib as I like to have a little bit of a crust. It came out medium rare just like I like it and the crust on the end was perfect. The sauteed green beans were just a delicious and as well as the Fleming's Salad. I could have had two of those as that salad  really was that good. I only ate half of everything (sans the salad) as I wanted to save room for dessert. I was so excited to try the Chocolate Lava cake and I waited with anticipation to receive it as they are made to order and it takes 20 mins. Sadly it was not all that great. It may have just been me but the chocolate was way to bitter for my taste. I have had quite a few different takes on the Chocolate Lava Cake and regretfully this one was not a favorite. I did enjoy the vanilla ice cream that was topped with fresh pistachios though so all was not lost. Nick, bless his heart was excited to ask me if it was a good as I remembered it and sadly I said no. He immediately offered to replace the dessert but I told him no as I really was full and I was very content with eating the ice cream. 

If people watching during the week is anything like it was last night , then I will definitely be back again to try their happy hour, which is nightly from 5-7 in the bar area. It will give me chance to try some of their delicious appetizers and drinks for $6 each and of course to people watch :) Oh who am I kidding, I will be back regardless!"}
{"text":"Don't get an opportunity to treat ourselves much. This was an absolute pleasure. Lois and I both had the Flemings house salad with lemon vinaigrette that was crisp and the dressing just the right amount of acidity and lemon flavor. We each chose the small plate, Lois had the braised short rib that was almost like a pot roast on a bed of spinach. I chose the small plate of shrimp and scallop scampi served on a bed of squash vermicelli. Excellent. We really went all out and had their creme br√ªl√©e with Chantilly cream. Fresh berries on top. I can't say enough about our meal. Oh and not to forget the hot loaf of bread with two flavored butters, champagne infused and smoky cheddar. Our servers were very attentive. Carmen and Javier you were fantastic!  Thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"So I chose Flemings to celebrate my birthday yesterday. It has been about a year since I was there. There were 4 of us. We all had steaks, they did not disappoint even though my husband's steak had to be returned to the kitchen 3 times. Ordered medium plus and it was rare. The nice thing is that they gave us another steak which we took home and made an adjustment on the bill. The wedge salad is huge and can be shared as can the giant loaded baked potato. One person in our party had the flemings potatoes which are like au gratin with cheese on top. The spinach and mushrooms were tasty. Service was top notch. A great place to celebrate a special occasion. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent, exactly what you would expect from this brand. Not usually. Fan of chains but Fleming's gets it right"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. Very pricey, but nice for special occasions. I ordered the special, which was a Chilean sea bass with crab meat on top. It was incredibly delicious. Bother got the aged NY strip, which was very good."}
{"text":"we were looking for a steakhouse on yelp and decided to go here based on the good reviews on yelp. so far, this has been the second best place we have gone to eat since we have been in Arizona (first was at Ed's http://www.yelp.com/biz/eds-phoenix-2#hrid:8lk6pOKXtyRyce-1EyqlWw/src:self). We got the Summer prix fix with the fillet mignon and that was a pretty good deal as it comes with a appetizer and dessert. The Prime Rib was very good and that also comes with a salad and dessert choice which made it a pretty good deal. The sides we got were corn and string beans, and they were just ok. For dessert, the prix fix comes with a banana creme broulet and that was good. For the prime rib (only served on sundays), you get to choose your dessert and I chose the Chocolate Layer Cake. It takes 20 minutes to prepare since it has hot fudge inside and it was pretty decent. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I joined another couple for dinner and took advantage of the Sunday Prime Rib special.  The beef was tender and the meal was a good value.  Two of us ordered the Lava Cake (dessert is included in the special) and they were both overcooked and contained no 'lava'.  Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The service was so attentive, pleasant and caring. 
My glass of red wine was smooth and fruity, I rarely drink. We began with  a plate of 3 cheeses, various berries & spiced walnuts. My salad was moist, fresh and tasty with crispy thin bread. The sides of mashed and asparagus were prepared nicely and enjoyable. The finale was a creamy cheesecake with whipped & blueberry sauce, so good.

One negative the restroom soap smells commercial, yuk, especially when the stalls are so classy."}
{"text":"We dined with them and was so disappointed.  Service was horrible and the food was substandard.   Would not recommend this  place to anyone.   We had reservations....waited 30 minutes for a drink after getting seated...ordered appetizer before dinner which we never got.   My prime rib was so fatty I couldn't eat it.  The waiter didn't even question why I didn't eat my entree.   One table next to us walked out...I will never go back."}
{"text":"I like Fleming's. The food is very good with service and ambiance to match. However, our experience on Mothers' Day was disappointing. We had requested a table in the main dining room (for a party of seven.) When I found that we were being hustled to the closed off back room, I objected and we returned to the hostess stand. Mr. Jeff, one of several \"suits\" berated us for not accepting our assigned table.  He was anything but gracious. We were finally seated in the virtually empty main dining room. The menu was fairly new and the print is light and small (bring your glasses.) I looked for my Sunday favorite, the prime rib special but it was nowhere to be found. Our server, Jim said that they had removed it from the menu. Big mistake!! The next outrageous mistake is serving a choice grade of filet mignon rather than prime which everyone expects from a high end restaurant. You are paying for prime but are served choice. I can buy choice grade steak at any supermarket. I made some phone calls on Monday and found that while Morton's too serves choice filet mignon, Dominick's, Preston's and Mastro's serve the prime grade that you are paying for. Until Fleming's bring back the Sunday prime rib special and serves up a prime grade filet mignon, I will spend my hard earned money where I get what I paid for."}
{"text":"Was this the same brand?  My wife and I have been going to Flemings at different locations for years and it is my wife's favorite high end steakhouse. We have been to locations in Tyson's Corner, Naples, Orlando and Tampa. We love this brand, the food is good and the service excellent. 

Not this Scottsdale location. We arrived on time for our reservation. First, they took the wrong name. After my wife spelled it out. So there wasn't a reservation according to the greeter. We had to convince her to look again. Thankfully my wife's unique first name allowed them to find it. Then we sat for 25 min as walk ins and a group of six, whose reservation was also lost were sat. 

Finally we were sat and waited for about 10 minutes before our waiter came. He took our
Order but by drink glass was frequently empty throughout the night. My wife ordered her usual small plates filet, substituting the mushroom risotto. And was told they cannot do that. She normally does this but ok. 

Good was on par after we got it. But we will not go here again. I hope the north scottsdale location is better."}
{"text":"Most happy hours in the valley are more or less the same. Same especially in the sense they all post prices for happy hour.  The one unhappy exception is Flemings by the Hilton on Scottsdale road.  But hey it's a steak house with a decent reputation , why not try it.  And we did.  And we were very disappointed.  Our waitress told us Absolute vodka was the happy hour vodka.  So given that we ordered a round....on the rocks and with soda. We had friends with us so when I saw $10 for each vodka while paying the bill I  was a bit peeved.  So I get home and call Flemings and speak to the bartender and he says \"No sir, what you ordered are not happy hour items\". What???  

Bottom line nobody knows what they are doing.  Will never go back even with their good onion rings but very small happy hour burger.  They better educate staff when asked a direct question about the menu.  Sure not the worst thing that can happen in life but it's irritating."}
{"text":"Before you read my entire review, please note that my boyfriend and I are primarily vegetarian.  We do eat fish on rare occasions (so technically pescetarian), but I primarily cool entirely vegan at home, which is most of our meals.  We received a Fleming's gift card for Christmas, so made Open Table reservations to check it out.

We were immediately seated at a large booth.  The service was spot-on for our dinner.  Our waiter was attentive, but gave us our space as well.  We had a couple of glasses of wine, which were fine.  We didn't order anything special, as we have nicer bottles at home which makes it tough to want to spend a ton of $$ one wine at a restaurant.

We ordered the Jumbo lump crab cakes as an appetizer.  These were great.  Maybe not the BEST I've ever had, but right up there.  Next, we split the Heirloom Tomato and Homemade Burrata salad.  This was also nice - not overly dressed and quite simple.

I wasn't all that hungry, so we decided to split two small plates.  We ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna and the New Bedford Scallops.  We also had a side of the Fleming's Potatoes.  First, the potatoes did NOT go with the food at all.  That is probably our fault for ordering them, but our waiter highly recommended them.  The potatoes were good, but very rich and the flavors were quite overpowering when compared to the fish.  Both fish dishes were great - we liked the Tuna better than the scallops.  

Overall, we had a good meal.  Will we be back?  Probably not.  While the food was good, it was also quite expensive and not really our typical style.  This seems like a great date restaurant or somewhere to take someone you want to impress."}
{"text":"I'd heard great things about Fleming's, so I was excited to go last week for dinner. 

For starters, I love a good bread basket. They have a fabulous one.

Their wine list is presented on an iPad, and rightfully so - it is gigantic.

We split the caesar salad which was great and even a small was easy to share. 

Since I wasn't super hungry, I ordered the scallops. Four midsized scallops in a delicious meyer-lemon honey glaze. The side of vegetables were fabulous as well. I had a few bites of my husband's ahi tuna which was also excellent.

I'll definitely return - looked like they had a great happy hour menu as well!"}
{"text":"Great place for a romantic dinner.....  I would definitely cross state lines again just to dine at Fleming's!!!!

The service was remarkable, the steak was incredible, and the molten chocolate cake was heavenly!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a Sunday night in July. Very hard to find this location, signage is not visible from Pima or from the entry to the shopping center. Eventually found it. Service was good, not great, pacing of the courses was a bit irregular. I had the Ahi small plate, wedge salad and double cut pork chop. All were very good, and well prepared. The manager did circulate towards the end of the meal and seemed very engaged with the operation which is a plus. Decor was pretty dark, which seems to be the norm in steakhouses these days. 4 stars for food, 3 for service, 3 for decor/location."}
{"text":"Normally this is not in my range. Interestingly my friend and I found ourselves here after not being able to get a reservation at my choice. Our food choices were very well prepared. We were treated like royalty the entire time even though were were not buying the $45-60 steaks. Now I know what the bar is for a special evening I want to find another reason to come here or a similar place. And in this case the special reason was only to use up a gift certificate. :)"}
{"text":"Was at Flemings attending an event and even though the event had some amazing food and great wines, we were wanting something a little bit more, so we spoke to the manager (who was in the party) and told him we would like a table for 2 for dinner, and he was delighted and got us seated pretty quickly.

Once we were seated our server came by, he introduced himself and offered us a glance at the wine list, but we had to let him know that we just came from the private party were the wine was flowing, but we did order a large bottle of Acqua Panna. If God were to cry, Acqua Panna would be his tears, it's just one of my favorite bottles of water. Some great tasting bread was offered as well.

After checking out the menu I knew what I wanted. I ordered the main Filet Mignon with a steak companion of King Crab with Herb Butter topped with Caviar. We also ordering some sides, the Fleming's Potatoes & Grilled Asparagus. 

Let's talk about the steak, this was definitely the star of the plate, I like my steak still pink, and this was cooked perfectly, oh and it was so smooth like butter! The king crab was the perfect side to this great steak, it picked up the flavors of the herb butter very well, and who doesn't love some caviar! This was a great steak! 

The grilled asparagus was cooked just right, tender yet not too much so, can't believe I didn't like them as a child, now I can't get enough of it! The Fleming's potatoes oh they were a surprise, they are a potato au gratin style with cream, jalapenos & cheddar cheese, oh they were divine! I think potatoes should come like this all time. 

We had great service, excellent dishes, l look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I am sad to say we did not have a very good experience this time. My husband and I are big advocates for Flemings but we are not so sure any more. 
We visited this time to celebrate our Valentines (a little late but our job schedules don't always allow us to celebrate on the exact dates), I had made a reservation earlier in the day for 6:30 for their \"Arizona room\" since their dining room was booked. They assured me that it was heated with heaters and a fire but ill get to that... We arrived around 6:10 and let the host staff know we were there.. They already seemed pretty flustered and it was only 6pm.. We waited till about 6:35 ish till we were seated where the fans were all on, ppl at other tables were wearing their heavy coats, none of the heaters were on and the fire really didn't seem to help at all and I shivered the whole time only after asking our waitress if the fans could be turned off.  We waited for our server to come for about 15 min and than waited another 15 min for our drink orders...
We finally got to order and waited at least 45 min to an hour before receiving our food. My husband ordered his fav, the filet and a baked potato (medium), however, what came out was almost done with no pink at all in the center and I ordered the pork chop with the mushrooms, it was just okay... Not better than what I could make on my grill at home! 
The server finally came back to check on us and when my husband replied that his steak was just okay she must have mentioned it to the manager. He walked over, asked how our meal was and gave us a coupon for $25 off to use Feb18-March 28th...as well as removed the steak from our bill... We were glad they did something but sad that we were so excited to go to one of our fav more upscale restaurants only to be pretty disappointed. 
We weren't sure if it is under new management or new ownership all together but I hope something happens fast or else most people will start to go to the other locations."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Flemmings last evening! What a delightful time! The atmosphere is perfect to get together with friends. I must admit,  the steaks are prepared deliciously! For dessert, I ordered the lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  This is the true test. Is the cake center gooey and warm so that the fudge runs out to be met by the vanilla ice cream?  YES! Perfect! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Steaks are good here. Their appetizers aren't bad. The bar menu is also not bad and I'd recommend the 8-10pm menu if you are just looking to grab a quick bite. Their burger and empanadas are pretty good. Didn't like the filet mignon pizza much, as it has blue cheese on it. The drinks here are good and service was ok."}
{"text":"Hard to argue with the rest.  Being a weirdo and confined to a $30 limit on my expense report, I ordered the Salmon Nocoise Salad and was pleasantly surprised to receive a nice half filet with a great assortment of veggies.  Washed it down with a nice cool Stella.  

Service from the barkeep was great and the manager stopped by to say hi, even though they were a few minutes from closing.  Impressive."}
{"text":"server named Erica was extremely nice. and the manager Corey very friendly. drinks were great. however, the steak was some of the driest blandest steak ever. no flavor at all. if they employ rest chefs here, I'd look into restaffing.  and the chicken is a joke. slimy and bland. I had two bites. gave it to my dogs. for the money I could cook up food 5 times better.  and have.  asparagus was hard too. the potatoes were ok. if you wanna spend 150 on 2 star food then this is your spot. but this place could use some new cooking"}
{"text":"Oh my, this place exceeded all of my expectations food wise and service wise. I was at Steak 44 earlier this week and I'd have to say I was disappointed with that place. Fleming's is my new go to. Staff was very courteous and I think we met the manager as well, very nice man. We were there celebrating a birthday and we were greeted with a card signed by the staff and a little special gift at the end of our meal. The lobster Mac n cheese was excellent and the bone in ribeye was mouth watering. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So made a reservation for our 44th anniversary.  Husband wanted to sit in bar and watch football, when we got married at the Bel Air Hotel in LA I had tonsillitis and hubby watched football on our honeymoon night on a Monday in our room at the Bel Air.  We had a  gift certificate from our kids--came for the prime rib dinner which we thought was $34.95 but it was $40.00.  Sat in the bar, prime rib was thin, not like the thick slices we enjoyed in the old days, have been coming here for 15 years more or less, called for manager to verify the price, she did come over but was cold and said they were going according to Corporate, when we checked in they knew it was our anniversary, yet after finishing our dinner reminded our waitress it was our anny and she gave us $25.00 towards our next meal---don't know if they still do it, but Morton's used to print out a special menu with our names on it and take our picture--Flemings---so disappointed tonight with the meal and your service---please review your service---I will use up my gift certificate but will not be going back to the North Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel I look for the perfect ribeye.   I've tried most of the restaurants in the area and scanned my gps for a different steakhouse.   I've never heard of Flemings before, and thought I would give it a try.    Thought the prices were normal for quality steakhouse.   Service was excellent.

Was NOT disappointed in my ribeye.   Extremely tasty with great flavor.   Probably the most tender one I have ever had.    Definitely on my go back list."}
{"text":"Very romantic setting. Not as quiet as I'd like but it was happy hour. Steak wasn't done to my liking which they quickly rectified and brought me a new one. They also took it off the bill which I was shocked about. They didn't have to do that, I was very pleased with the second steak. Service is always amazing every time I go."}
{"text":"We've been to various Fleming's many times - looked forward to our visits as \"special nights\". Gradually however, we've noticed a decline in quality coupled with a fairly noticeable increase in price. We haven't been in some time due to cost, but got pulled in based on an unsolicited $50 gift card I received from them. Our visit last night was probably our last visit - just not worth the cost.

We both had the \"Angus\" rib-eyes. My SO had hers med, mine med-rare. The waitress asked us if we wanted them \"seared\" to put a crust on them and we both said yes. (Don't recall being asked previously, most steak houses assume this is how one wants an expensive steak.) Both were pretty much cooked to order, except no sear whatsoever - on my worst night I put a better sear on my steaks.

Also, we both noted that the steaks were extremely lean, not a hint of marbling. Both steaks were fairly juicy, but as a result of the leanness much more reminiscent of a choice NY strip, not even close to a prime ribeye. We're both big steak eaters, both at home and at restaurants, and both of these steaks were poor renditions of $50/lb prime meat - slightly chewy and missing the flavor of a juicy, marbled ribeye. If you like ribeyes you know what I'm talking about.

I routinely buy choice ribeyes at Costco, and recently bought a couple of choice 2\" thick bone-in ribeyes at Safeway - both were *vastly* superior in flavor and tenderness to what we had last night - and both were about $13/lb, not $50/lb. (I get that one is also paying for the experience, but the food has to match or you're not getting your money's worth.)

The Fleming's potatoes were good, however seems like the portion is smaller. Two smallish servings of potatoes and cheese for $12.

Spinach was very good, as was the service.

Tab came to about $165 plus tip with two decent glasses of wine and no dessert ($115 plus tip after our gift card). We did not drive home with warm thoughts about the wonderful meal we'd just had, and probably won't be spending our dining dollars at Fleming's in the future. (Update: interestingly, less than two weeks after I posted this review news came out that several Fleming's locations are closing because they are \"under-performing\" - apparently others also feel that overpriced, less than stellar food just doesn't cut it.)"}
{"text":"I am suprised that anyone would have anything negative about this restaurant.  It is by far and away my favorite place to eat in the valley.  The steaks are always cooked perfectly and the service is impecable.  I failed to mention  that the staff is also very attentive and knows my name.  I have not found a favorite server there but they are all very good.  The wine list offers so many different choices it is easy to find what you are looking for.  And if you are a chocolate fan like me, you must try the chocolate lava cake, it blows any other cake out of the water!  I enjoy a more personal dining experience and not somewhere that is only after my money.  I love Fleming's and think you should all try it!"}
{"text":"Flemings of Scottsdale, AZ, If I could give \"0\" stars I would. This in hotel restaurant and its server embarrassed 1/2 of our table of 12. While we were the ONLY table in the restaurant. Having finished our dinner and enjoying desert and cocktails our server cut off the beverages, without speaking to our host, for absolutely no reason...the only thing we can figure is the staff wanted to get off early. Needless to say, Flemings will never be in consideration for anyone in this party again."}
{"text":"Time to update my review of this place.  Besides the awesome Steaks they have here, this is a great spot for happy hour.  We meet friends and associates here often for happy hour.  They have this awesome \"5 for $6 'til 7\" happy hour menu:

5 Wines, 5 Cocktails, 5 Appetizers, 2 Entrees, or 2 Blue Moons for $6 ea....that's an amazing deal!

We enjoy the Wines of course and some of the appetizers we get are the Roasted Pork Belly, Carpaccio, and Mushroom Ravioli.  Our fav entree is the Prime Burger w/Cheese & Bacon...it's a huge Burger for only $6.

This is a great spot for dinner or happy hour, check it out if you can.  Best part is we love to get the gift cards from Costco....$80 for $100 worth of cards....that saves us an additional 20%.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I dined at Fleming's recently on the insistence of a friend, and while the service was good, I thought the food was shockingly high priced for what it was. 

I had a small filet. It was correctly cooked and tasted very good. Just like I make at home when I buy steaks from AJ's. The reason I was not very happy was that my bill was around $80 for a small filet, a couple glasses of wine and a couple shared mediocre appetizers with two other people. No sides come with the meat at all. My steak was close to $30 alone. For a place that bills itself as a wine bar, I was disappointed with the by-the-glass choices. I guess if you are only searching for a good-tasting steak and you don't know how to cook, Fleming's is the place to go.  

Guess that's what you get with the \"lowest common denominator\" style big national chains. I would not steer most people away from here, as I think this is what most people want: predictable and decent. I just figure I don't want to spend my money or calories on boring food when there are so many awesome local restaurants in this city!"}
{"text":"Not that Flemings needs my help or anything...BUT

My wife and I went here last friday and had the time of our lives.  I've been there a few times and they addressed us by name and even knew how long it had been since our last dinner.  The wait staff is exceptional and the food was B B B B BOMB!  I have the parmesan encrusted halibut and my wife had the petite filet.  

If you've never been you should definately check this place out.  I highly recommend it.  Ask to be seated in Lindsey's section.  She's GREAT!

{"text":"1.5 Stars. 

I don't know where to begin. (Skip to TL;DR)

Service:
Our server was not very pleasant in the beginning but he warmed up and then followed it with passive aggressive attitude when our orders came out wrong, or didn't come out at all. 

Fun Note # 1:
One busboy said he was \"too tired\" to be working when my wife asked how his night was going.

Food:
My wife went with her typical non-steak choices: Wedge Salad and Shrimp Cocktail. Her shrimp were forgettable. Her Wedge salad came out with dressing on it, even though she asked for it on the side. When they brought it back out, it was poorly presented on the plate.

My steak was cooked as ordered, but did not have any flavor to it. It was just a really bad piece of meat. 

We also ordered a side of asparagus. This was a $10.95 mistake for us to share. My wife summed it up with, \"my Bird's Eyes microwavable bag has better flavor.\" There were also two stalks with their flower ends cut off. If the asparagus is bad, do not serve it.

Soup:
Soup? I picked the French Onion. It never came. The waiter asked how our appetizers were, and I replied that it never came. He took the melted butter that he just put on the table, and said he would \"put it under the heat lamp\" while he got my soup. It's butter, just go get new butter! The soup still never came. Then he brought back the butter, which he relit, and said our food was on its way. The soup was eventually brought out by the busboy with my steak. I never ate it.

Fun Note #2:
The jerk of a server asked if I was done with my soup when I was eating my steak. I never touched it, and wasn't planning on letting my steak get cold. 

Manager:
The manager came over after hearing about my wife's salad mix-up to ask how everything was and to take it off the bill. He was very polite, and even gave us his card. (I don't think he knew about my soup.)

TL;DR

Jerk server; messed-up orders; food never received; bland tasting steak (maybe the cow's fault?) ; great manager"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Flemings on Monday July 16, 2012 for happy hour 5p to 7p.  We enjoyed the $6 happy hour menu sitting at the bar starting with tenderloin carpaccio , sweet chile calamari , shrimp cocktail, all were worth the $6 each.  Although we had the sweet chile sauce on the side for the calamari very good appetizers shrimp good flavor cooked in house.  My wife for main course had the lamb chops with fried polenta served with it she really liked this dish the chops were the size of lolli pops three pieces but very very good.  I had the in house made $6 prime 8oz burger cooked rare with swiss and cheddar cheeses bacon on a nice brioche bun it was cooked rare and tasted very good.  Also served with this burger was two large fried onion rings , slice of iceburg lettuce and slice of tomato.  Along with a few beers for me my wife had the in house made sangria it was not worth th $8 price.  The bartender was very detail minded friendly great service !  
We will be back for dinner next time.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"If you are not afraid to spend a bit to get the best steak in town, then Fleming's is the place. Great service. Exceptional food."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner for my birthday, had a great time. When it turned out they lost the leftover steaks, they cooked us new ones to go. Thank you Seth!"}
{"text":"I read some very negative reviews about Flemings at DC Ranch but I have to say my time was amazing. Yes it is a little pricey but sometimes what you pay is so worth it. Had the Filet special which was a salad, a side, filet and desert. All were fine and Molly our server was a real keeper. Maybe this location is hit and miss but for me it was a nice hit. Took my amazing cheesecake home and digging into it. Perfect way to end the night. Thank you Flemings for me you rocked it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants is Flemings Steakhouse.  My dad and I go here at least once a week because the food is absolutely amazing, and the service is wonderful.  Because my dad and I go here so often, we are on a first name basis with the manager, a couple of the hostesses, and two of the waiters.
 The first thing I would like to point out is that the food is absolutely astonishing.  My dad usually gets the eight ounce filet mignon with chipotle macaroni and cheese.  He describes the steak as \"mouth- watering\" and it is outstanding.  The filet is prepared to his liking, not too pink on the inside, but not burnt at all.  The chipotle macaroni and cheese is one of his favorite sides because of the different tastes and the little spice that is added.  He says it reminds him of baked macaroni and cheese, which is his favorite food.
However, I will only have a few bites of his steak once he is finished, and I usually get the Caesar salad and shrimp cocktail.  The Caesar salad is my favorite appetizer on the menu; it is not overdressed, and it is the perfect size for an appetizer.  Even though the shrimp cocktail is on the appetizer menu, I generally get this for the entr√©e.  It is the ideal size and satisfies me.  The four large shrimp is chilled perfectly, and it is great for a smaller size entr√©e.  
Once we finish dinner, I order a couple scoops of the mixed berry sorbet, which is my personal favorite dessert on the menu.  I have always loved the mixed berry sorbet from Haagen Dazs; however, the rest of my family loves the infamous Chocolate Lava Cake.  I have heard Flemings is known for not only their steaks, but their amazing Chocolate Lava Cake.  Although I do not like chocolate, it looks to die for, and at that moment, I wish I liked chocolate.
The hostesses are extremely welcoming and super sweet.  They are always asking how we are and where we would prefer to be seated.  The waiters and waitresses are incredibly polite, as well.  I love that the managers personally come to the table and ask how our meal is about ten minutes after we have received our entr√©e.
The service is always spot on and great.  The waiter we have had the most often, and we usually request to be sat in his area, is Stefan.  He is extremely nice and never messes up an order.  He is a very social person and has gotten to know my dad and I very well.  He has our orders memorized and we are in-and-out of Flemings in no more than forty- five minutes.
Another fantastic aspect of the restaurant is their location.  The location of Flemings is perfect from where I live.  Flemings has two locations in Scottsdale, Pima Road and Legacy and Scottsdale Road and Lincoln; however, my dad and I usually go to the location at Scottsdale Road and Lincoln because of how much closer it is to my house.
 Living down Scottsdale Road gives my dad and I more options for choosing a restaurant, yet, we choose to eat at Flemings.   This is hands down my favorite restaurant, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Although it is on the pricier and fancier side, it is fantastic for special occasions and business dinners.  The service is superb, and the waiters and waitresses are incredibly nice."}
{"text":"I cannot think of enough terrible things to say about their reservation system at this location.  I was a huge fan of Flemings and a very loyal customer, until now.  The complete lack of customer service and obvious practice of over booking reservations is beyond disappointing.  Looking forward to a nice dinner?  Bring your patience (and a snack)."}
{"text":"I've only had the good fortune to dine here once with a friend, and I can't say much about it other than it was glorious. 

It is everything you'd expect from a premier steakhouse: excellent high caliber beef, amazing service, great drinks, tasty desserts. 

It isn't cheap but neither is the food they serve. In many respects, I prefer it to Houston's because it feels like less of a scene to me and much more about eating a drinking really high quality things. 

Paul Fleming (of PF Chang's fame) does steakhouses even better than he does panasian, in my estimation, and the next big payday or birthday (hint, hint) I may opt to celebrate here."}
{"text":"French onion soup is very good amazing steak chocolate lava cake is amazing"}
{"text":"Great late night happy hour!  It was about 10pm and most places were closed, but Not here.  We indulged in a couple of appetizers and recommend the baked Brie.  If you want a great burger, Fleming's served me one of the best prime burgers I've ever had and raised the bar for all other restaurants."}
{"text":"It all starts at Paul Martin's Steak house across the street from Flemings!
I am not sure how to rate food I did not eat! I came in on Sunday to celebrate my anniversary. We specifically chose this place for the prime rib, unfortunately they did not have it despite offering this dish as their feature choice. We were offered an alternative for a significantly higher price. But it was not the price hike that we felt offended by, it was the condescending nature of the manager.
We felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed that we even asked for a price match. This reason alone is why we thanked the server and left. I can handle bad food, but bad service is unacceptable. 
We cane across the street to Fleming's and they did not have prime rib either, but they immediately offered an alternative with sides for the same price! We never asked, they offered it to us. They gave us the desert when we mentioned it was our anniversary and the server and the manager gave us a $50.00 gift card and a gift wrapped box full of chocolates!  Simply Amazing!"}
{"text":"I had only been to Flemings once for their fabulous happy hour.  I decided to go for my birthday.  I ordered the \"wrong\" thing and they quickly turned what could have been a disappointing situation into a reason to come back.  Nice atmosphere, great service, excellent food.  Yes - a little pricey - but quality costs.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Let me preface this review by saying I spent many years in the restaurant industry. I worked for high end independents as well as in upper management for several national chains, so I think I am a fair judge of the elements  needed to provide a quality dining experience. I also have empathy for my brethren in the business, so I rarely do negative reviews.
I'm sorry to say that my experience last night at this Fleming's was very disappointing. First, the food. The Verrado mozzarella app was actually very good, the best item of the night. The salads, a blue cheese wedge and a Caesar were only adequate. My NY steak was ordered medium rare, came out medium well. Inexcusable for a $59 prime steak. I would add that even if it were cooked correctly, it was not an impressive cut. My wife's filet was also ordered MR, and came closer to medium. My baked potato was small and lumpy and NOT hot, inexcusable at any cost, but especially for 11.50. My wife's truffle mash  were acceptable. The bread that accompanied the meal was laughable. Stale and cold.
For some reason, they thought it was our anniversary and had a happy anniversary card on the table when we were seated. No problem, mistakes happen. They whisked away the card. No napkin to be found at my seat. Greeted promptly by the server who took our drink order and said he would be back with bread and water. 10 minutes later, one of the managers stopped by to wish us a happy anniversary, nice, but, as I said, wrong table. Bread still had not arrived. Server arrived with our drinks and said \"Oh, I'll get that bread and water right over\". When he checked on us after the first few bites of our entrees, I mentioned to him that my steak was over cooked. His reply: \"Yea, the grill is really full tonight and they have over cooked a couple of other steaks 'cause they are so busy\". Really? Give me a break, this isn't Texas Roadhouse. Did not offer to replace, although I would have said no because I just wanted to get the hell out of there at this point.
We spent $300 for this lovely experience. Never again."}
{"text":"I think if God ever wanted a steak he would come down to Fleming's and order the Bone In Rib-eye.  Seriously Good Eats.  I am drooling a little right now just thinking about it.  

Oh and then get the Fleming's Potatoes.  Like a combo of scalloped potatoes and enough cheese to choke a donkey, truly delicious.

I know the wine list is killer, but I can't stop myself from downing one (or four) of their amazing martini's.  There is a huge list of them that I have such a great time touring.  

Finally, desserts!  I cannot come here without a group because after eating my steak, potatoes, (oh and great apps too, try the seafood tower, it is really tall), and drinks I don't have enough room to eat a whole dessert, let alone two because that is what I am going to order.  Yes I cannot make up my mind between Chocolate Lava Cake and Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e so I do what I do best and get both (to share of course).  They are so good and together they compliment each other perfectly.  The Lava Cake is so chocolaty that I could go into a coma and the top of the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e cracks perfectly under my spoon.  I think I am diabetic now.

In all, this place is amazing, pricey but well worth it.  True you can come not dressed up but I like to make an occasion out of it.  You can find me in a cocktail dress with the chipmunk cheeks stuffed with food.

PS do yourself a favor and think about making a reservation, comes in handy."}
{"text":"Good steakhouse.  I've been here about half a dozen times.  I've never had a bad experience with the food here, or the service.  I prefer this over Morton's and Ruth's Cris, but not over City Hall or Mastro's other steakhouse up in North Scottsdale. 

Standard menu.  Everything is a la carte, like other fine steak houses.  If you go here, you will not be disappointed...but be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"Delicious Steak and good wine selection last night at Fleming's Steakhouse in Scottsdale, AZ. 

I had the New Wedge salad and 5oz Petite Filet. Cooked perfectly Medium Rare. Great flavor.

I'm not a big fan of a la carte pricing and family style service. For me it removes a bit of the personal touch and service I think is expected.

Great location for larger parties but I probably wouldn't take my date (@amywesttravel) there. A bit loud and not as many private seating options as I prefer.

Overall, good experience and good food."}
{"text":"Wow I just spent a week in Chicago where the food is out of this world. I stopped at Flemings after a holiday party. Happy hour was still going on. The food and service was A Plus. It has been years since I have been there. The bar only had 1 seat and was super dark. I was with my 88 year old mother. everyone eating in the very dark bar were so nice and even wiling to move so we could have 2 seats. All worked out well. Staff was so professional and nice, even though the place was packed. Great Tv watching for football. Beyond great service and to ,my total surprise the happy hour food was terrific."}
{"text":"Very nice happy hour.  I sit at the bar and try various appetizers, paired with a Syrah or Malbec.  I loved the Caesar salad, ravioli and the seared tuna.  The steak is very good, but not the best I've had.  

Staff provides excellent service and remembers repeat customers."}
{"text":"So Fleming's as a whole has gone down hill. There food is ok but over priced...not that I am reviewing the food, great steak and wedge salad I would recommend. 
However went there for my father-in-law's birthday and not only did we have a reservation that we checked in for 30 minutes Early, they said it would be an additional 25 minutes. Plus the hostess was completely inappropriate in her interaction with my father-in-law when he asked how much longer it would be when we had been waiting an additional 30 minutes. She didn't get the manager when asked and we had to go ask a bartender/waiter to get him for us. No offer for a complementary drink while we waited, barely any apology. The manager finally was able to get us a table 30 minutes late. If you want some over priced food great. If you want overpriced food with WAY better service, then go to Preston's, City Hall...Outback?"}
{"text":"This place disappointed. 4 people out of 9 had their steaks cooked wrong. Took 20 minutes for the meat to be redone, and 3 of the new steaks were still cooked wrong. 

The pork was tasty but not served at the requested temperature. The short ribs were tasty but overdone and dry.

Management wasn't apologetic at first, but eventually made things right moneywise. I'm not coming back here. Too expensive for the lack of service and quality of food. If you want great steak, great service, and good atmosphere, go to mastros, steak 44 or Dominic's."}
{"text":"This is the second time and the last I'll ever go here. My husband received a gift card and we came here to use it. However, it seemed like a $50 gift card here pays only for an appetizer. First of all, the mahogany  decor makes the whole place look very dated to me. This location is in a very nice area and you would think there'd be enough profits fro the over price meals to pay for some upgrades.  
I was looking forward to the Brussel sprouts and bacon but they were drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. It was pretty inedible. I had the New York strip and it tasted like a steak from the dollar store. There, I said it. I had a better tasting meatball the next day at an Italian restaurant. The only thing good about this place was the service. Waiter was very attentive and worked well with my allergies. The rest is not worth coming back to and spending most of your paycheck."}
{"text":"We sat in the lounge for happy hour. Had the burger and wedge salad. They use prime beef for the burgers providing outstanding flavor. The $5.00 glass of Cabernet was very smooth. The best part of the evening was the outstanding service staff. In fact, I left my cell phone on the table and the waiter ran out in the parking lot to wave me down so that he could give me my phone. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"To put it in one line Fleming's is a 3-star restaurant posing as a 5-star restaurant.

The issue for me at my visit to Flemings was service.  The hostess was rather unenthusiastic.  It seemed was just her job to point us in the correct direction, which was the bar to wait as our table got prepared.  For a 5-star place, a reservation is a reservation, and the table should darned well be ready when advertised.  I expect to wait for a table at Outback, with the little buzzing and flashing beeper, but Flemings isn't Outback.  Right?  And as I will state later, getting the food orders correct was an even larger issue.

For background, I was part of a large group (11 people) for dinner.  The bread served before the meal was absolutely delicious; fresh, hot, with a crispy crust, tender middle.  Drinks and salads were ordered.  I got a Caesar salad, and all I can say is that it was adequate. I have had a better Caesar salad at my employer's cafeteria.  But, I'm not there for the salad.  Fleming's is all about steaks.  

The server moved around the table and took orders.  Our server was cheery and tried to make small-talk conversation with the table.  She took the orders where overall there were 8 steak orders (some of the couples got one meal and split it) and various sides.  I ordered the prime rib-eye; whenever I go to a steak place, it is my benchmark meal.  When the food arrived I had a very nice, although I would call it a bit small piece of Filet Mignon in front of me.  A very nice cut of meat, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Also, one of the couples at the table was not brought any food.  So, doing the math, the serving staff has a 25% chance in bungling your order.  The staff re-took the incorrect/missing orders and about 5 minutes later the manager was by to apologize.  The couple who had the missing order was offered a shrimp cocktail; I was not.  Maybe that is why I'm the odd person at the table.  I started munching on the community sides watching my other friends enjoying their steaks.  As for the sides, they were adequate like the Caesar salad; nothing to see here; although the Fleming potatoes were better than average.

About 15 minutes later, my steak arrived, a bit rare for medium rare.  Gee that would make it rare.  I was hungry, and I ate it anyway.  The steak was very nice.  Tender and tasty, the way a good rib-eye ought to be.  To be honest it was one of the best rib-eyes I ever had, although slightly undercooked.  Much more tender than ones in those cowboy steak places.  There is something about the flavor of fat from a good rib-eye, and that is why it is my benchmark steak.  I was not alone on the notion under-cooked nature of the steak.  I guess from a management standpoint, undercooked is better than overcooked.  But I am of the school nothing goes back unless I am always within eyesight of my food.  I've seen the movie \"Waiting\".  

We got desserts, and did them community style.  The walnut turtle pie seemed to be the best liked.  I didn't do the walnut turtle pie.  Walnuts are a bit bitter for my tastes.

The timing for delivery of food was a bit slow.  This was \"European\" dining.  Reservation at 6:30, offered dessert 9:30.  So, in a way we owned the table for the evening, or maybe the staff realized they were not going to turn the table for another customer, and with a large group tip was set, so there was no need to hustle for the tip.  Slow service is fine, if that is what you expect.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed chatting with my other friends at the table, but this was not typical \"American\" dining service.  On the good side, the water glasses were filled with great regularity.  Water glasses were 12 oz glasses, and these glasses never got below half full.  Service from the bar was not as good.  I ordered a glass of Shiraz before the salad, and the glass arrived after the salad.  So, about 20 minutes to get my glass of house Shiraz.

With respect to the food errors, the manager did deduct the two meal errors from the bill, and that was very generous from Fleming's management.  But mistakes like this will crush high end places.  From a profit perspective, that's $80 that Flemings management isn't going to get, and a not so stellar review on Yelp.
So for me, I give Flemings a 4-star for food, 3-star for service, and a 2-star for value.

As for me, I'm not a high end restaurant guy, but from the small amount of travel I do for the company I work for, I have seen some higher end restaurants.  I was expecting penultimate experience, and I received an Outback level service experience.  

Ultimately, the question is: \"Did you get what you paid for\"?  For my money, it is a resounding no.  But Flemings is in the business to appease business types with expense reports and such.  It is sufficiently snooty enough to impress your customer, so the corporate sales guy can give the impression to his customers that the company he represents \"cares\"."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places, not just because the food and service is so great, but, because the staff is just terrific. Mark, Cory, Tyler, Joey, Amy, Stephanie,(those are just the names I can recall off the top of my head) and everyone are just so kind and personable. We always have a fabulous meal and really feel comfortable and at home."}
{"text":"I took my wife there last night for Valentine's Day. Let me first say, the staff was great, very attentive. But, for such a high priced dinner ($239 not including the tip) I expect a lot better food. Neither my wife nor I was impressed. We both agreed that our filet mignons were so so. She said hers was dry, and I've definitely had much better. The scallops were slightly fishy tasting, the crab legs were not bad, but nothing to write home about. The bread with the two cheese spreads were good, as well as the lava cake, but, for that price, I would hope to be impressed, and I'm not. I think in that price range, we can do a lot better. If this was a $75 dollar dinner, I would probably give them 3 stars, but, again, for the high price they charge, it was not worth it. Sorry Flemings, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were invited to join a friend for a seafood grilling class and wine tasting, what better way to spend an early Saturday afternoon? 

It was an intimate setting, three or four tables of people, everyone was friendly and interested in learning some new techniques. The chef was knowledgeable and made some excellent grilled fish and veggies. The waiter was also well-educated when he spoke about the wines. 

I hope they have another class soon on how to grill the best steak!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for happy hour from the recommendations on yelp.  The drinks were good and the service was good as well.  The server could only seem to find one 5 for 6 menu, so it took a while to figure out what to order.  We ordered Calamari which was OK and shrimp which was fair.  The shrimp simply did not taste all that good and we left some on the plate.  Maybe it is because I am from the East Coast, but I have had better.  (Much better at Mastros. All in all it was a good value for happy hour.  Crowd was older ...very senior.  Maybe because it was Wednesday."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and Flemings is attached to a Hilton Resort where I was staying.  I was at a 2 hour disadvantage because of the time zone and with an 11 hour day of travel I didn't want to go out searching for a place to eat.  I showed up during Happy Hour and sat at a booth at the bar.

They had a nice menu for happy hour which included a burger for like $8 which was wonderful, for the money.  Heck, you spend $8.00 at McD's now and this burger was hands down the clear winner.  Cooked to perfection, cheese and bacon and all the fixings.  I also had a bowl of French onion soup.....which was good but served pretty much boiling hot where it took forever for it to get cool enough for me to eat it.

It was busy at that bar, not in the restaurant since it was so early and I can't understand what took so long for them to bring me my burger.  It was well over 30 minutes and I had to chase the waitress down for it.  This was the only downfall of my visit."}
{"text":"Birthday and wedding anniversary dinner on 12/24/11. Upon giving our name and reservation time the ladies offered their congratulations on our anniversary and wishes for a happy birthday! I requested a \"quiet\" table and we were shown to a small room off the main dining area. It had only 6 tables..nicely intimate and quiet. Our server, Nate, was at our table in an instant. He was very professional, attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable, friendly but not too \"chummy\". He offered birthday and anniversary wishes as well. 

Husband and I both ordered the Lobster Tails. They were perfectly cooked. I ordered the Fleming's Potatoes which were delicious..a sort of scalloped potato with cream, cheese and jalape√±os. Husband ordered Sauteed Mushrooms which were also very tasty. For dessert we ordered the Creme Br√ªl√©e. We ordered one but Nate came out with two desserts, each with a lit candle. The Chantilly Cream they served with the Brulee's was out of this world, crazy good! Don't miss that. After all this we were sent home with a large piece of chocolate cake to continue our celebration.

The entire experience was wonderful! Fantastic service and great food. I want to thank Nate for helping make our special dinner even more special. 

Fleming's IS pricey but I felt for the service and food quality it was well worth it for a special dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

Jeff the executive chef is ridiculous.
My steak was beyond perfect.
The shrimp was exceptional.

Service was as expected, prompt

This is the best!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a filet with his friend oscar on top. Well I guess if you place a couple tempura shrimp on the side...

And the best creamed spinach in the the whole world.

Hands down my favorite steak place.

Service, food and presentation.

The best!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend it.  The place use to be very good and a favorite.  It was just an awful experience.  The food was below average.  We found hair in the food.  My water was empty for a long time.  They sat us outside.... It was freezing.... Trust me.  Save your time and money."}
{"text":"While visiting the area I had a hankering for a nice cut of beef. After picking some local friends brains, I was told that Flemming's was the place to go. Absolutely stunning steakhouse! Some colleagues and I stopped in one evening without a reservation and had to wait about 10-15 min for a table of eight. After being seated our server was very prompt and helpful. This being many of our first time here, our server was very patient and willing to spend the few extra moments with us to discuss the many items on the menu that we were interested in. Awesome drink menu and plentiful selection of brews. The appetizers we got were amazing!

After finishing the amazing steak and sides I was more than satisfied with my choices. The next option was dessert... Oh boy!? After thinking about it long and hard I did pass on the dessert as I was stuffed after my main course. Some of my friends do still joke with me as the server asked me if I wanted deep fried filet migon with ice cream. I was sure that the server was serious and it appeared that they would make basically anything we wanted.

After paying the bill and complementing our server to his boss we were all thoroughly impressed. Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be stopping by for another amazing steak!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We brought her cousin here to join us for the celebration.  We all had the same thing. We ordered the filet mignon with lobster tail three course meal.  We started with the blue crab empanada, followed by a Caesar salad.  The blue crab empanada was delicious with an incredible mixture if flavors with each bite.  The Caesar salad was fresh and tasty.  Now talk about the lobster tail and filet mignon.  I am not a big fan of lobster, but thus one was the best I ever had.  The filet was on point and cooked to perfection.  We were totally impressed by the service and the quality, tasty, meal."}
{"text":"Crab cakes tasty but very small,  jumbo shrimp skewers not very jumbo, great coffee, over pricy"}
{"text":"Flemings is a perfect alternative to Mastros or Dominicks or any of the other places where you drop a mortgage payment on your meal. Flemings is certainly not cheap, but overall it's about 15% less per item (like $39 for a filet vs $46) at Ocean Club, etc.
The steak is every bit as good. The service is excellent there and the ambience is in the same category. Perhaps Ocean Club has better interior design, whatever. 
Add to that Flemings runs some really good promotions from time to time like bonuses on gift cards or prix fixe menus and I go there about once every month."}
{"text":"So disappointed in steak, which is supposed to be their specially.   Ordered it medium and it came to me \"mooing\"--literally raw inside.   This after telling us our table was ready but then giving it to someone else...Oh, and we had to ask for bread as they forgot to serve that in addition to a fork.  All this for a grand total of $260.  Will not be going back and will not be recommending."}
{"text":"Great steak.  Had bone in filet Oscar.  My husband had dry aged ribeye  Best ever.  Service good.  Great night out in DC Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We came back again tonight, after 9months. My hubs got steak (ribeye with blue cheese crab sauce) and I got lobster.  The steak was meh. Mushy, charred on outside, and tough. My lobster was pretty good, but didn't taste as sweet as Maine lobster. I can tell the difference. Our service, as always, was most excellent. 

Disappointing to have two 3-star steaks at $45 each. Boo."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve 8 o'clock reservation. Started off very badly. The hostess was not friendly and told us to wait in the bar. The bar was so full that nobody would help us. At 8:15 I went to check back in and the hostess wryly said  \"I was looking for you\". I told her she walked right by us. I grabbed my husband and we were seated in a horrible seat. I refused to sit in the booth because the table came up to my chest. They put us at a table and we proceeded to order two martinis. The debonair martini, that my husband ordered one server and all of and of all things and onion!  Wth??? $14 for a martini and an onion.  I sent it back and I brought us another one not even with an olive.  It felt to refill the water and they're just very disorganized. I realize it's a holiday but next time I will go for Mastros, who always gets it right.  By the way at Mastros, they make a martini in front of you and leave the extra for you. It's like getting one and a half for the price of one.  Will Not be coming back."}
{"text":"Avoid Flemings at Pima for happy hour.  Lots of tables vacant, lots of staff hanging around, but no one to get tables ready.  Restaurant needs management."}
{"text":"This Flemings is one of the best I have enjoyed.  The manager and staff go out of their way to make your meal the most pleasurable experience possible.  You can not go wrong with this restaurant.  We recently celebrated a birthday there on a Saturday night and they made my family feel like they were the most special group in the restaurant.  OH - and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This was my second dining experience at Fleming's and instead of dinner, my husband and I came for Happy Hour. It was a beautiful evening, so we decided to sit on the patio. We had a gorgeous view of the mountains and setting sunset!

Our waiter was quick to arrive and super enthusiastic, friendly, and helpful. Throughout the night, every employee that stopped by our table was just as friendly and helpful. It was great service the entire night.

The Happy Hour menu is titled \"5 for $6\". That's 5 Cocktails, 5 Wines, and 5 Appetizers each for $6. The cocktails all seemed to be different martini variations - some with rum, others vodka. I asked about the Tropical Martini since I love tropical drinks (pineapple, oh yesss). Our waiter described it in great detail and said how delicious it was, so I had to order it. After one sip, my husband decided he needed one as well. 

For appetizers, we ordered the calamari, the pork belly, the burger, and salt/pepper shrimp with green beans. We also ordered a cup of the French Onion soup, since it's my favorite. The calamari and soup came out first. Our waiter split the soup into two for us, so we didn't have to fight over one bowl. It was delicious! The calamari my husband really enjoyed but I thought was just okay. It was a little too chewy for my tastes and the breading was falling off. 

Next, our pork belly, burger, and shrimp came out. The shrimp was delicious. There were five large shrimp breaded in a salt/pepper batter and deep fried to perfection. The green beans were also coated and fried. I really enjoyed the shrimp and could have eaten more. The pork belly was delicious as well. It came with grits and onion chutney. The chutney alone was savory and sweet; very tasty. When added to other items, it made the other items delicious. My husband really enjoyed the pork belly and ate most of it. The burger was good, but nothing amazing. It had cheddar cheese and bacon, which was a plus. We couldn't finish the burger, as we were so full from the other items!

Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and have always enjoyed the file mignon or prime rib, creme brulee and attentive, professional service.  Atmosphere is nice with some younger (late 20s, early 30s) customers and not too stuffy and overrun with older businessmen/ppl like some other steakhouses.  

When we made our reservation, were asked if we're celebating a special occassion.  Server presented a Godiva-like gold box w 4pc chocolates and a 'happy birthday' which I thought was very sweet."}
{"text":"Eh...

We had some gift cards from Christmas, so we decided to dress up a little and check the place out.

We started out in the bar, where luckily it was HH. The bartender was so nice and down to earth and she mixed us an amazing gin concoction off their HH menu. It was potent, refreshing, not too sweet, and went down way too easy. The complimentary freshly made potato chips at the bar are scrumptious and perfect to settle your belly when drinking these strong drinks. 

Dinner wasn't as great as the bar experience. My husband ordered a filet Mignon and I ordered a few sides, since I'm a vegetarian. Now, I don't mind going to a steak place as long as the side dishes are impeccable. I'm perfectly content with some delicious starches and veggies. I was looking forward to sampling their sides but our server wasn't very enthusiastic when I told him I was a vegetarian. He mentioned what he thought was good but he didn't really seem keen on selling what little they had for vegetarians. Hmmmmm...

On to the food... I had mac and cheese. It was good, not great. No comparison to the green chili mac n cheese at Roaring Fork. I had a loaded baked potato sans bacon. Again, just okay. Can't really screw that up. I did find the skin of the potato to be tasty... they salted it quite well. Had sauteed spinach too... was good. I ordered a dirty martini and it was awesome! 

My husband was looking forward to his steak since he barely gets to go to steakhouses. He ordered his steak medium rare and was disappointed that it came out medium. He did not want to return it because we had to be at a show in less than an hour. He said the taste and quality was good but he could replicate it at home very easily for a fraction of the price. He had a tiny side of Fleming potatoes which was tasty but it was the exact same sauce they used for the mac n cheese. So don't order both because they taste exactly the same!

Our server was okay. Kind of cold and I felt like he was disappointed that we didn't order more expensive items. I did like that the manager stopped and said \"hi\". I told him I was a vegetarian and he recommended the ravioli appetizer. It sounded delicious. He was very lively and personable. Wish he was our server...

Atmosphere was weird... I expected it to be dark and hyper masculine, after all it is a steak house, but the wood paneling and extreme darkness was unnerving. With that setting you would expect the background music to be jazz or some Sinatra or something wouldn't you? Nope. They were playing top 40 from the last 2 decades. Kind of weird to be listening to U2 while eating steak and drinking dirty martinis.

Overall, I don't think the experience was worth the money. Each side dish was $10. Most of the steaks don't come with sides and they are well over $30. Luckily we had gift cards, but otherwise our bill came out to $105. For under $20 I could have made the same meal and probably make it taste much better. 

We did have an excellent experience at the bar. My husband was drooling over the bar burger the person next to us was having. I am open to trying HH there again."}
{"text":"Amazing quality of food.
Hands down the best place we've ever eaten! Don't go here expecting to pay under $50 a plate though.
We got the strawberry cocktail and the Manhatten! (Each $16 drinks and VERY well worth it! ) Manhatten was extrordinary!! Almost pure bourbon, lots of taste. Also could only finish 1/4 of it because of that lol but new fave! 

My order was scallops and grits... literally melted In my mouth! Lighting and atmosphere was very pleasant. We came here after a very long day (18 hours) of delayed flights and driving. We were very impressed and cannot wait to stop here again in the future! 
Appetizers were good... salads were fresh.
Hubby got the grilled salmon and it was also done perfectly. Sliced right when you poked it. 
Can you tell we loved it here??"}
{"text":"I have a long history with Flemings...We go way back. Seattle, Washington, high school Senior Prom dinner. Yeah...That far back. That location is now closed, but I digress. When I moved to Scottsdale, I was excited immediately because there were multiple Flemings locations. It quickly became my go to special occasion dinner option, as my wife loves it as well. 

In short, the food is phenomenal. I've had multiple cuts of steak there and different preparations and they're all amazing. Last time I had a 6oz Filet that was stuffed with jumbo lump crab...Just let that sink in for a minute. Their sides and salads are also really nicely done, and their wine list and bar is one of the best out there. They also have a very good happy hour which is a pretty well kept secret. It's 5 items for $6 until 7pm Monday through Friday, and they also have $6 glasses of wine and cocktails as well. 

Obviously the food should be great, but the thing that sets Flemings apart for me is the service and commitment to quality. A brief story, if I may...

In July of 2011 I made reservations for my wedding anniversary. We got to the restaurant and were seated, everything started out fine. It took longer than usual to get the bread course and to get our order taken, and since it was a Wednesday night it was a little surprising. Everything was taking forever, but the biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered a New York peppercorn steak medium rare. When it came, it was well done. Brown inside and tough...I sent it back and they were apologetic for the mistake. It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my second steak (my wife was done eating hers by this time), and while it was still overcooked for my liking, it was edible. The rest of the service continued to take way longer than necessary, the waitress wasn't attentive, and at the end of the meal, there was an issue with the bill that took another 15 minutes to resolve. It took nearly 3 hours (and not in a good way) from start to finish, and was not a good dining experience in the least.

I ended up writing Flemings the next day to express my disappointment, because it was a special occasion, and I'd never before been unhappy with the food or service I received. Within 24 hours, I had an email from the President of the company saying that he was very sorry and he'd have the GM of the restaurant reach out to me to amend any issues. The next day I got a call from the GM Mike Head and we chatted for a few minutes about our experience. He too apologized and asked me for my address so he could send something to make it right. Two days later I had a letter with a business card and a note saying \"please call me personally to arrange your next reservation\", along with $150 in gift certificates. I was floored.

We've since returned a few times, and the food and service was back to it's absolute best. You will rarely, if ever, see business done like this, and it's the reason I'm happy to keep Flemings as my special occasion go to."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. Food was delicious. The bread and spreads are addicting and it's a love/hate relationship. I had the sliced filet which is a smaller portion but amazing with the porcini risotto and served with a little spice. My boyfriend had the ribeye which was incredible and asked for a side of the peppercorn sauce- wow. OKAY AND THE CREAMED SPINACH. I've never been obsessed with creamed spinach, I mean? weird. But this stuff is like crack. The molten chocolate desert was absurdly good and the wine we indulged in was fantastic (True Grit Syrah- Mendocino) Impeccable service. I believe our server's name was Tom and he did everything right. Made awesome suggestions, shared honest opinions and had great knowledge of both the wine and the food. But it didn't stop with him, everyone involved was great and attentive. The bussers and food runners were lovely as well, and then the manager stopped by to say hi towards the end of the meal just to see how everything went."}
{"text":"I thought that things could have been much, much better. The prices were high compared to the level of service and the quality of food. The staff were friendly but not sensitive to the needs of the customer.

I thought that some of the dishes could have been better prepared. For instance, the calamari was served drenched in sweet and sour sauce, so it got soggy very quickly. Also, the bernaise sauce was cold and not very good, and the tarragon was so strong that the sauce tasted like licorice.

It will take a lot to have me back at this restaurant. I can think of at several other restaurants that are a better value."}
{"text":"We had a 7:30pm res for 6 with a stroller ( baby was very good and slept pretty much the whole time) They didn't sit us until 8:00pm ( the restaurant was empty ). SERVICE was epic. The server ( name rhymes with harrah ) was awesome! 

We ordered a bone in filet. 20 mins after we ordered they said they ran out of bone in filet. This was Friday night at the end of high season in central Scottsdale. Shame on Flemings for not sticking their # 1 entree and shame on Preston the GM for not coming by. I'm 38 and well to do, if your not 49 years old + and or have gray hair you get treated like a worthless millennial. The bill was $800 for 6 people. This over rated restaurant and their useless upper level management needs to be replaced. I'm not coming back....."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary one evening and the experience was unforgettable.  My wife enjoys a good steak and so, I thought of Fleming s. I've been to Ruth Chris', but heard so much about Fleming s that I decided to give them a try.

From the moment we walked in, we were treated like regulars. We sat at a booth which was nice and comfy. Our server was Nick who was very friendly, pleasant and  was very knowledgeable, but he cleared more utensils that he needed to and forgot to bring the two knives that were removed.  We weren't rushed and had enough time to decide on our meal. My wife started with a glass of Pinot Noir and since I'm allergic to alcohol, I had water.

The appetizer, Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes was not jumbo, but the crab and sauce flavors were. The salad, Lettuce Wedge, you were given a slice of bacon and blue cheese which you had to crumble yourself and my wife's Modern Caesar Salad was excellent. Main course, Newport Filet and Main Filet with a side of sauteed mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the button mushrooms are the ones I like instead of the sliced ones.

We followed the evening meal with the Turtle Pie and coffee which capped off a wonderful anniversary dinner. By the time we finished our first cup, Nick was right there filling our coffee cups again.

The manager came to our table several times to check on us, was friendly and gave us an incentive to come back which we will definitely use. We only saw our server once during our meal. The bus boy was terrific, he brought our missing pair of knives and kept our water glasses filled and cleared our table for us. Everyone there was so friendly and was not your typical stuffy high-end restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went to Fleming's spur of the moment and rolled in there looking like biker, white trash. I was a little concerned that we would be asked to leave or seated in the far, back corner. The opposite happened! We were seated in the very front or the establishment and treated like royalty. The drinks were filled with fruit and delicious...I had a few \"Farmer's daughter's\" (lol, drinks! Get your mind out of the gutter!) . My husband had the bone in ribeye which he said was the best he's ever had and I had the filet which was perfectly prepared.
Our server was fantastic and really made sure that we had the whole experience. So, when I read that people were shuffled off to the back room because of how the look...I call BS. I walked in with torn, dirty jeans, a Harley Davidson shirt, covered in tattoos and was treated with respect, and like a valued customer. Thank you Fleming's, we will be patrons for life."}
{"text":"Customer service is subpar!  My spouse and I attempted to have a nice dinner for the evening.  However, to my surprise, they claim that they do not have any availability for the remainder of the evening!  Even though from what we could see, there were several empty tables.

After we walked out disappointed, we saw that we could make reservations online, and those were available.  Not only that, but when I had called the restaurant to make a reservation, they had no problem getting me a reservation (in the next 20-30 minutes).  However, walking into the restaurant in person, no reservations available. 

Must be completely judgmental on the way people look.   If you are not wearing items of clothing costing over $3,000 ....you can forget about getting a seat by simply walking in.   What a snobbish little restaurant....fits well being placed in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING from the wait staff to the drinks to the apps to the steaks was top notch. I was surprised when the Uber pulled up and it was attached to a Hilton but it turned out to be a great surprise. Everyone in our party was impressed with the food and ambiance and we're tough customers because we hail from a very foodie town. If you want a great experience, try Fleming's!"}
{"text":"$42.95 for the summer special..a filet and lobster tail-NOTHING comes with that...except a salad(or soup) and amuse bouche. The filet was TINY...the lobster tail was TINY(2oz??) overcooked-tasted like mush..yuck. The asparagus($10.95) were good...would I recommend this...NO WAY...go to Maestro's!!!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for our 10 year anniversary. It wasn't spectacular but very pleasant. The steak was perfectly cooked and the lava desert cake was delicious. The sides are additional to your $50 steak and very mediocre (hence the 4 stars) We had reservations but the place was not busy (for a Friday night) so we got seated right away. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. 
If you come here, though, prepare to spend a pretty penny. It was $200+ for the two of us."}
{"text":"After reading some of the recent negative reviews, I was a bit hesitant returning to Fleming's.  However, there proved to be no reason for this as dinner was terrific from start to finish.  Wedge salad as good as it gets, excellent dry aged prime New York strip cooked perfectly medium rare, great bottle of hard-to-find Hartford Court Land's Edge Pinot Noir at a fair price, fresh berries and chantilly cream for dessert.  Service was outstanding from server Heather and maitre d' Chris.  Seems they have raised their prices which are now in line with Mastro's and Dominick's ($59.95 for the dry-aged strip) but worth it as everything was top-notch."}
{"text":"Ive been to a few Flemings in my life and added the recently remodeled Scottsdale to the list.  My wife and I came here the other day and had a wonderful dinner experience. 

When you go to Fleming's it's all about the steak. I usually stick with the fillet mignon cooked medium but decided to try the Wagyu New York strip. I learned that Wagyu is the American way of Kobe beef, so I had to try it! I was very impressed, the steak was tender and very flavorful. It's a more deeper flavor than the fillet. I think I would actually order it medium rare next time though as the closer to the center of the strip the more flavorful it became. Overall a great piece of meat.

My wife ordered the Sunday prime rib special. Talk about a deal...she got a wedge salad, thick cut of prime rib, mash potatoes to share, and a dessert! All for $40..really for the amount of food and quality you can't beat that. We ended up sharing the lava cake which was amazing...even was served with ice cream. 

We also shared the chipotle Mac n cheese, so good I was in heaven! 

Service was great usual and ambiance was very nice."}
{"text":"I wasn't aware Fleming's had an A/V room, replete with screen and ceiling projector.
Do you know what else this room has?
A light switch with no dimmer.

For those of you lucky enough to be seated in the main dining area, if you look toward the right rear of the room and see a very bright light, (sans the tunnel) that's the place.

When first ushered into the room, I asked if this was the steerage section.
They didn't laugh.

Turns out, it WAS the third class section, only they were too nice to not inform us how we'd be eating our meal while being interrogated by a team of international spies, under an intensely bright light. To make it more fun, we were seated in the center of the room.
These guys are real pranksters.

After a while, others were ushered into the room, all of whom looked like they'd fucked-up in the lobby while waiting on a table and were now being punsihed; a mom with a small whiny child, an old couple - both with walkers, and a couple so obese, I think they sat them in there so if the chairs collapsed, no one would see.

Fleming's - you made us feel like we didn't belong - as though we weren't good enough to sit in your half-empty dining area at 5:30 on a Saturday night.

The next time I hope to see a light this bright, it's going to be after trudging through a long-ass tunnel, looking for an old white haired guy in a robe with a big 'G' on his pocket.

Other than the bright light, dining with 'Goonies', and the extremely slow service, it was a real fucking hoot at 170 bucks.

If your hostess marches you toward this room, don't go in there. Fake a seizure of something.
Just don't go in there.

You've been warned."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful service. I am currently active duty military visiting family from out of town, and a trip to flemings started my vacation off right! The food was absolutely wonderful. Best service I have ever received. Joseph was our waiter, I would highly recommend him. :)"}
{"text":"I could be a jerk and rate it 1 star worth poor service in hopes of getting some free gift cards or something but Wow wow wow wow. What an amazing meal. Amazing service and a great environment.  There was a party of 100 in the private room and our server was apologetic for the \"slow\" service but In fact it wasn't slow at all. It was great.  Thank u for a pleasurable experience"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a Friday night to celebrate a special occasion. While making the reservation, a gentleman on the phone asked what we were celebrating and if they could have any champagne brought to the table. I thought that this was great service and obliged since I did want to make this special for my wife and I

Got to restaurant a little early, but they were able to seat us shortly. Got to the table and there was a nice card congratulating us. Champagne was brought over by one of the managers named Larry who introduced himself and let us know our server Heather would be right over. 

Heather is awesome! Such a great personality and very knowledgeable. My wife and I shared some burrata and a Ceasar salad prior to getting our entrees. I hade the bone in Filet and my wife ordered the small plate of lamb chops. That was one of the best steaks I ever had and my wife seemed very happy as well. We topped it off with the Turtle cake and left completely satisfied.

Thank you to the staff for making a great night even better! We'll be back again"}
{"text":"Owner responded with a very nice offer to \"make this right\".  Unfortunately, for both of us, my original negative experience was at the DC Ranch Fleming's (NOT this one on Scottsdale Rd.) and none of us made the connection until I showed up with my guest (with a reservation) at DC Ranch!    DC Ranch did resolve the issue, graciously, and for that I am very grateful.  Service was excellent, food was good there.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!! Our small business conference group were treated like kings. Food was perfect!!!!! From appetizers to Desserts. I wish all Flemings were this great. :)"}
{"text":"Went to eat here on a Sunday to try their \"prix fixe\" menu with a party of five. Most of us opted for the Caesar Salad first (good) and Prime Rib as the main course. To say the meat was bad is an understatement unless you like fatty, tasteless beef. We all ended up trimming anywhere from 50- 70% of our meal and pushing it off to the side because it was not edible. Additionally, when one of our parties meals showed up it was ice cold so the rest of us were eating while waiting for his food to show up. 

If it sounds like the food was terrible (it was) the service was utterly and disappointingly consistent. First, one of our party ordered an End Cut on the Prime Rib and was told by the waitress that \"she would try\". When he asked to be informed if it was available or not so he could choose something else if it wasn't available he was met with an attitude as if he asked her to rope a steer and cook it herself along with informing him that if he committed the mortal sin of changing his order if what he really wanted wasn't available he probably would have to wait 20 minutes and wouldn't be able to eat with the rest of our party! What??  

When ordering our meal, our ever so friendly waitress told us that we were supposed to decide on our dessert at that point as well. Have to admit I've never been pressured to decide what I want for dessert before I've even put a morsel of food in my mouth but we complied. Two in our party chose the bread pudding only to be told when it was time for dessert an hour later that they were sold out of the bread pudding. When we asked what the point was of being pressured to decide on dessert the hour before if it wasn't going to be secured we got a blank stare and were told our diners would just have to choose from the other TWO dessert options on the special menu. We spoke to a manager who then told us we could choose a dessert from the regular menu since it was their fault they didn't secure the dessert we ordered. But when our diners chose the Lava Cake we were told by the manager that was the one dessert that he would not give them! Keep in mind this is supposed to be fine dining and our tab was over $300 and this is how people are treated when the restaurant is at fault. And last but not least, don't expect anything that might resemble a timely refill of your water or iced tea with your meal. Not happening. 

Overall, terrible service, terrible food and high prices. If you want to get what you pay for and have a good dining experience, don't walk away from Flemings....RUN!"}
{"text":"It's no secret that I'm not a huge steak fan, but since my parents like it and they were treating for dinner, I was powerless in the negotiation of venue and we went to Fleming's, an upscale steakhouse serving dead animals graded USDA Prime. Mmm.

Despite the mall location, the restaurant is dark and intimate and the bar looked inviting. My affinity for plastic is relatively low, and with the exception of the Scottsdale equivalent of a gangbanger (an adult frat boy bearing a backwards-turned cap indoors) and his Barbie doll/date, the only people who were in desperate need of recycling were the hostesses which was a pleasant surprise given the environs.

On the recommendations from a sweet but not saccharine waitress, we sampled:
[NB: Prices are approximate, since Fleming's avoids website sticker shock.]
- Starter platter (Gratis): Brie, olive tapenade and some crostini, celery and radish - a light start and a substantial improvement over the standard bread offering (which is also optionally served at entree time upon request)
- Crab Cakes (~$15): Great crabmeat to breading ratio but not superlative as advertised
- Sweet Chili Calamari (~$12): Expertly lightly fried, breaded and sweetened
- Petite Filet (~$30): Dry, which is unfortunate in the most tender of steaks
- Bone-in Ribeye (~$30): Very juicy and flavorful, significantly superior to the former
- Beef Flemington (~$28): Filet Mignon in a light pastry shell and a Madiera sauce, juicy unlike the vanilla offering - a solid A
- Dessert Sampler ($13):
  - Creme Brulee: Divine vanilla goodness, I'd order it again and I'm not a general fan
  - Cheesecake: Thoroughly unremarkable
  - Chocolate Lava Cake: Overly sugary molten chocolate in a thin souffle-ish cake shell
  - Peach Cobbler a La Mode: Proving the exception of the \"less filler\" trend, heavy on the cobbler but light on the fruit

Outside of parental benevolence, an expense account or a serious apology to a significant other from the heartland, I wouldn't be looking for a dining experience like this, but I'd come back if the time was right. Unlike other local high end steakhouses, Fleming's does it with more tender delicious substance than heavy oily pretension."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location. I'm from California and love the Newport Beach Flemings.  This was just as good. Everything was incredible. Great service and delicious steaks."}
{"text":"Going to Fleming's used to be a nice occasion.  On this past visit, this restaurant's food had gone down hill quite a bit (we had the same experience in Palo Alto on their prime rib night).  Wine list has been greatly pared down, and there was nothing we really wanted.  Scratch this one off the list."}
{"text":"This is the Flemings you want to go to for that fine dining experience. Apparently there are two types of experiences in the Flemings chain: Fine Dining in Scottsdale and noisy, dressed in shorts (RedRobin kids screaming) in Chandler. 

Eddie was our server in Scottsdale and was always on top of things. Food was excellent and atmosphere was great. It was easy to carry on a conversation here. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food: went to happy hour. 5-7pm daily BAR ONLY. 
We got: Portobello mushroom ravioli, calamari, fillet mignon flat bread, and the burger. Everything was so good and at a great deal except the ravioli. Don't get the ravioli. 
We also ordered the chocolate lava cake. Drool. So delicious. Warm chocolate cake with chocolate filling, 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, cookie crisps and sprinkled with pistachio nuts. 
Drinks: some wines listed in happy hour, cocktails and blue moon. The whisky cocktail is so good. Highly recommend. 
Service: great service, highly attentive. 
Restaurant: dark. similar to a casino. You can't tell what it looks like outside. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This steak house delivers every time. The warm bread with the cheese spread was scrumptious. The wine list is extensive. The steaks were absolutely splendid. In our party someone ordered the brunch choice and loved it. Service was top notch. Ambiance was just right. Will definitely return and enjoy their steaks again."}
{"text":"Fleming's keeps sending \"Customer Appreciation\" dining incentives that are hard to resist, which brings us back literally from 10 days ago for dinner, on a Tuesday evening at 7:00. I was pleased to observe that the restaurant was mostly filled on a early weekday. 

So I update me review, because within the 10 days of not being back, the MENU has been totally revamped, no longer having the small entrees that I raved about because I'm not a big eater, in it's replacement \"Chef Jeff's Table\" which are special menu items that will change. The main menu now has dish calories listed, so in some cases you may not want to know the calories of your dish or you may not care and in my case I like to know but it's not going to stop me from ordering what I want. I just like to know the calories I'm intaking.

Cocktails are always well done here. My dining partner and I ordered the Lobster Bisque, Modern Caesar Salad, Carpaccio, Chef Jeff's Scallops & Smoked Bacon and the 24oz. Porterhouse. The Lobster Bisque and Scallop dishes were EXCELLENT!. The Caesar Salad shouldn't be so \"Modern\" and go back to the \"Classic\" way, maybe using fresh white anchovies instead of what seemed canned store bought. The Carpaccio good, but again maybe less \"Modern\", more the Classic balsamic vinegar with olive oil rather than a mayonnaise base, which would perhaps make it less caloric and healthier too. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY! but the quality of steak was rather tough and thin for a 24oz. steak at $71.00. All in all still good and we'll be back!

Atmosphere: excellent, Service: excellent, Food: very good!"}
{"text":"While not having reservations on a Saturday night during the BCS Bowl games we were lucky to get a seat. In the bar area. However I had a great view of the 2 plasmas and was able to leave the sports coat in the car.

We had to wait a few moments to get a server, but once we got our server she was FANTASTIC! My wife and I have just gone thru Gastric Bypass Surgery and had a limited amount of choices to make on the menu. We both shared a bowl New England Clam Chowder. Which was THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Then we ordered from the appitizer menu (Gastric Surgery has it's perks) We decided to try the Chilled Seafood Platter with Lobster,Giant Shrimp,King Crag legs, and Snow Crab. It was so fresh we barley needed any dipping sauce. We also ordered a side of grilled carrots another thumbs up! We ended up filling ourselves and had left overs to take home. Total bill came to $56.93, w Tip! We not only enjoyed the food but the atmosphere and the service. I would like to give Flemings Steak House a 2 thumbs up! Thanks for making our 17th Anniversary one we will never forget."}
{"text":"LOVE the patio for happy hour!  My entire office goes once a month.  It's a bit more casual, quiet, and intimate than the main restaurant.  I've never eaten inside, but by the looks of it, I would really enjoy that , too.  All the drinks are great!  I've had the carpaccio a few times and I'm never disappointed.  Most usually get a burger."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great. Being able to make a reservation on Yelp = amazing."}
{"text":"I like this place for the happy hour and outside patio. The food seems to be consistent and a good value. 
I do like the prime rib and cocktails."}
{"text":"I went to This location in 2015 and was not impressed. I was overcharged for what I thought was a tough steak. I went there because I received a gift certificate. I would not go back. 

My daughter and son in law were there last night, 2/13/16 for valentines dinner. They had the suggested steak and lobster special. My 31 year old daughter woke up throwing up in the middle of the night and swears it is food poisoning. I suggested she contact you.

2 strikes for this location nearly a year apart. Needless to say we will not be dining at Flemmings again. 

I had to give it a rating of one star because it would not let me exit out of this page, otherwise I would not have given it one star."}
{"text":"We went here for Father's Day brunch - we made a reservation way in advance.  We were seated in a table which kept breaking - it was a round table which was actually a square table with an addition on it.  Seated in a corner which should not even have been a spot.  While the service was exceptional, Joey was our waiter.  The small portions for the brunch seem somewhat strange.  Everyone loved the Prime Rib which was huge.  The meat is not organic or all natural, even though it is a good cut it still comes from cows which have taken hormones, chemicals and were grain fed.  this poses a problem, and the staff at Fleming's was not helpful when I asked them about there lack of meat quality.  The service was great, but the meat quality was definitely lacking"}
{"text":"To qualify, this is Fleming's so it's not like eating trash at a food cart. But among the finer dining restaurants with which they compete - this one is a solid 2. 

The bartender started off strong making me a water before I realized she had even noticed me. I had to ask for the Happy Hour menu that the hostess mentioned, and ended up ordering a glass of wine and a salad. 5 minutes later, wine arrived. I ordered the sliced filet and lobster off the dinner menu around that time. 20 minutes later, salad arrived. No napkin. Runner of the salad begrudgingly fetched me a napkin. About 30 minutes later (after I noticed both people sitting beside me sit down, order, and eat their meals) my entree arrived. No silverware. Bartender showed after a few minutes to offer silverware (no steak knife). Steak was over-cooked and under seasoned. Risotto was tasteless. Lobster had better flavor but was slightly over salted and WAY over-cooked. Extremely disappointing for a 1.5 hour stay running almost $100 for one person. Do not recommend, particularly in the midst of so many more appealing spots in Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Before we even sat down to our table, my party and I sat in the bar for a glass of wine. With their extensive wine list, I assumed we could taste a glass before purchasing a $100 bottle of wine, unfortunately for us, they charge for wine tasters. (which I happen to think is CRAZY, considering I work at a similar kind of restaurant) ...But where to start?.....Broken wine glasses on the table when we first sat down. Ordered a baked brie appetizer, that was cold in the center. On several occasions our drinks were empty for 15+ minutes before someone would even walk over to our table. Our server was terrible, the bus boy did 3x the amount of work. No communication coming from the server at all. The food was \"alright\", we ordered scallops and filet, definitely not worth another $200 or a trip back."}
{"text":"We went there for our 54th anaversery and will never go back.the food was not to bad but the service was just terrible our waiter looked like he slept in the clothes he had on. I can't complain about the price but I could  get a comparable steak for much less money.its not the restaurant I had though it was ,more like a high end neighborhood bar and grill no for special occasions like a birthday or anaversery ."}
{"text":"I will make this short and sweet. Unfortunately, I did not share more pictures of the food because we were too busy eating it, and there are enough pictures already. I will say this: Fleming's Prime Steakhouse-Scottsdale is slightly behind Donovan's Steak & Chop House - Phoenix, but it is WAYYYYYY better than Mastro's Restaurants - City Hall. However, all the steakhouses in Arizona pale in comparison to Bern's Steak House in Tampa, FL (the best tasting steak and the best bang for your buck out of all the restaurants we have visited).

My wife ordered the taste of the seasons:
Filet Mignon and scallops
Salad
Puff pastries (like beignets) with in-house whipped cream

My order:
Main Filet Mignon (Oscar style with shrimp as well)
Asparagus
Molten Lava Cake

Overall, we enjoyed it.  My wife really loved the pistachio cookies that accompany the cake & vanilla ice cream.  I would come back to let my daughter experience it, and also they have a Prime Rib deal every Sunday (which comes with a salad, your choice of side, and your choice of dessert) for $35."}
{"text":"Celebrated my dad's 51st birthday here on a Sunday and it was great! We all got a little tiny taste of either sparkling or red wine, and decided to share a bottle of red (currently 1/2 off!).

Our server, Sarah, was very attentive and checked with the kitchen every time I asked for an accommodation which was absolutely wonderful! My sister and I both got the prix fix menu with the filet and either shrimp, lobster, or something else I forgot about that also came with a delicious salad and hasselback potato and a dessert. I was able to switch my dessert which was great. The potato was nothing special, it was pretty much just a baked potato. I ended up getting the creme brulee which was good, but nothing so special IMO. My sister got the original dessert in the menu stated as a salted caramel ice cream sandwich which came out kind of melted and sliding off. Honestly, the presentation was horrible but she said it was still good. 

Both my parents got the prime rib dinner which also comes with a salad of your choice, prime rib, a side of your choice, and a dessert of your choice. Everything was great but the chocolate lava cakes which they are apparently known for were both overcooked and were not lava-like. It was completely cooked in the middle. I guess it was soft but nothing ran out of it. I'm surprised that they didn't get the timing on the cooking down on that one.

Overall, food and service was great! It's pretty rare, though, that a restaurant messes up desserts.. those are usually the safe options! Nothing major though and I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were *that* family that brought a cranky toddler and a picky 9 year old to a fine steak house and Fleming's survived with style and grace and an excellent sense of humor.  We enjoyed every item on their happy hour menu as well as a pile of cocktails and every single thing was absolutely delicious.  I think the happy hour here must be one of the best values ever in the history of happy hours.  
Our server was funny - seemingly a little distant but in actuality totally attentive and on top of every special request we had.  Our favorite was our bus boy who had the nicest manners I've ever seen on an 18 year old.  His family should be so proud of such a great young man.
Wish we lived in town, we'd be regulars.  Thanks Fleming's for allowing us to enjoy a white table cloth evening while still enjoying time with our kids!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Fleming's for a long time, but I think I'm done eating in the main dining room. Ate there with the husband last night, and my NY was so full of fat and gristle, I had to send it back. They quickly brought me out a new one -- too quickly. It hadn't rested and bled all over my plate. Plus this one was filled with fat and gristle too! I think they must save the worst cuts for their pre-fixe meals, which is what I ordered. So stay away from those I guess, even though they seem like a good deal. My meal also came with roasted brussel sprouts. I LOVE roasted brussel sprouts, but these were terrible. Horribly over seasoned and flavored with something so terrible, I spit one out into my napkin and husband did the same. Husband had the Wagyu NY and it was really good--should be for $57 for only a steak. We ate with the $40 deal, so that took the sting out of it, but still spend $140 for dinner which is just too much if you're not totally satisfied. Love their Happy Hour, though. You really can't beat it and we'll still be back for that. So, five stars for the awesome Happy Hour and wonderful Wagyu, but please stop serving crap cuts of meat for your pre-fixe deal and maybe investigate those horrid sprouts. Really disappointing. 3 stars at best."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Exactly what you would expect from a high end steakhouse, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Might even be five stars, but it will have to wait until second visit.

I'm not usually big on steak houses.  I like to grill, and like my own preparation is better, and it's really not that hard.  I usually can't see spending a lot of cash on something I like better cooking myself.

Flemings is very good.  The filet mignon was perfectly seasoned and done medium rare.  Many steak places I have tried usually under season their meats, which leaves them bland.   They also try to cook them too quickly.   The reasons for this are really customer service; don't shock the customer, and get them their dinner quickly.    Beef should have a fair amount of time on salt to bring out flavor, and slower cooking to keep the meat tender, juicy and flavorful.

The appsy were great.  Salad, Onion soup, and mashed potatoes.  

They have some great wine, although I felt they were trying to be a bit manipulative.   The wine list was ranked  gold, silver, bronze, but it was purely on price, not relative to how good they really were.   I had a better cheaper wine, than more expensive.  This is a place where I would bring my own wine, and pay corkage."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Steaks are made to order but sometimes come out under cooked. Don't be afraid to send it back, staff is very attentive and will help."}
{"text":"Not somewhere I usually go unless it is a business function or a special occasion.
This was the case last Friday. I received a $40 off coupon from Am Ex and it was my wifes birthday. We got there early at 5:15 for a 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated. We were one of the first tables seated. Tommy, our waiter was attentive and explained the specials. We both got the 5 oz filet medalions (2) oscar style which was the chef's special for the evening @ $43.00. 2 sides and each a drink and the bill is $140 w tax.. Is it worth that much? You be the judge. The food, atmosphere, service and quality were all great. We enjoyed the meal and the $40 was the reason we came here. Could I go to TGIF or Outback for a similar experiance? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 6:00 and were seated right away, food was cooked to order and everything tasted great. Service was great and we were well taken care of the entire time. We split a wedge salad, which was amazing. Followed it up with a filet and baked potato. We also split a piece of cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"Just another steak house. Steak was good, but not Ocean Club standard, but same price. Not really a signature item that we could find -- however their specials and starters were delicious. BF ordered the seafood chowder that had shredded lobster on top, Chipotle Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Ravioli. Those were just his starters! He \"only wanted a bite\" of each one. The disappointing part of the night was not the food. Don't get me wrong, the food WAS good. Just nothing extraordinary. Nothing that made me say wow at all. Their service was just off all night! The fresh-faced high school boy who delivered all our food crashed each plate down in front of us, giving us the strict instructions \"don't touch any plates whatever you do. they're smoking hot and you'll get burned\". Then asked if we wanted cracked pepper. When we said yes, we had 2 turns of the pepper mill, then he walked away. We had to wave someone down to ask for more. All in all - Flemings will be great as show-off restaurant because of the name. But if you want an amazing steak with service that matches their price point, go to Ocean Club."}
{"text":"We had a really lovely meal here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I had never been to a Flemings, but I was impressed with the meat.  The price tag matches the quality, but then I feel like there is no reason to ever eat bad steak.  I actually had the scallops, my reservations in ordering steak came from a dining companion who told me Flemings was owned by the same people as Outback.  Then I tried my husband's ribeye.  Yum... perfect in every way.  The atmosphere is exactly what you want in a steakhouse, dark, cozy, a little bit of sex-appeal.  We sat next to the wine room, which I thought was a little awkward placement for a group of seven.  But maybe that was because we had made a last-minute reservation.  I would say Flemings is a great choice for a celebration or an intimate date."}
{"text":"incredible happy hour at the bar!

the burgers are delicious as are the bbq shrimp!"}
{"text":"Had 8pm reservations on a busy Saturday night, got there and were seated right away. Service was great. I've been here three or four times in the past few years and never really had any bad experiences. Was comfortable in jeans and a polo. We started off with the calamari, which was cooked perfectly but I wasn't big on the sweet sauce it was served in. Seemed a little cheesy for a higher end steak house. She ordered the Wagyu strip and I had the dry aged ribeye, along with truffle mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The cook was a perfect medium rare, the steaks themselves were decent... I'm a tough critic as I cook a lot of steaks, all higher end cuts of beef from local butcher shops (Hobe, Midwestern Meats, AJ's, etc). The creamed spinach was great, wish the truffle mashed potatoes had real truffles instead of truffle oil. Loved the bread with the champagne brie butter."}
{"text":"I wanted to followup my review.  The manager came to table to talk over situation and actually comp'd one of the meals ( which for me was above and beyond).  I will definitely be back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Had our \"big dinner\" there with my aging parents last week. 

It was a great pick for an occasion. Ambiance is rich, service is Downton Abbey-like, food is something from a cooking show.

My filet mignon was perfect. The scallops only lacked for bacon. Those Fleming's potatoes were wicked good.

And I broke a 30-day diet to mangia on Chocolate Lava Cake, which was the closest thing food comes to sex. Holy crap that was good. Seriously.

The whole staff was impeccably mannered and quite kind. Our waiter put up with my aging parents who don't hear too well.

It ain't cheap, but damn, it's good."}
{"text":"High end restaurant. The sides are HUGE, ribeye delicious and the molten cake is TO DIE FOR. Order it early because they make it by hand. Excellent wine selection, it's just a tad snooty for my liking. Anniversary spot for sure."}
{"text":"Back in 1st week of March 2018 my daughter took me and a friend/business associate  to Fleming Steak House for a treat for dinner. You know ...to relax , enjoy great food, great company, and her and our friend some red wine. Salads were fresh and plentiful & delicious as was the food(steaks , potatoes,  asparagus)  tender, cooked to absolute tender perfection ! The staff was kind, funny, and professional.  The manager heard through our waiter / server it was my friend and my first time there and came to the table to  welcome us and check to see if we enjoyed our experience. I do not get out much due to physical limitations but I did enjoy my time within. I knew the food was good when we arrived as it was packed full and waiting. 
Was expensive I was told but well worth it. If in the area make your reservation early! And try it !

We did. We came, we ate, enjoyed, conquered!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just celebrated our anniversary and decided to go out and have a nice dinner at Fleming's. It was our first visit there and I guarantee, it won't be our last. It started with first class service from our waiter James the time we were seated. Even though it was our first visit, he made us feel as though we were one of their long time clients. His sincere attentiveness to our dining experience was felt during our meal. It was also nice to have the manager Larry stop by to check on us several times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I think the last time we experienced that was on one of our cruises. Both he and James know how to delivery great customer service. Thank you James and Larry, we will definitely be returning to Flemings for our next special occasion!"}
{"text":"I've been to my far share of steakhouses due to my job however I always enjoy stopping by Fleming's with my wife. Their service is on point from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out.

Their selection of steaks are awesome. The sides are family style so pick a couple and share away. 

They offer the tomahawk steak, you're lucky if they have it, if they do, order it and share. Rib-eyes are so flavorful, cooked to perfection. Wife and I also had their lobster mac and cheese, which was good. Crab
cakes are freaking tasty. Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, onion rings, etc. No matter what you order here, it's going to be good. 

Great place if you're celebrating an occasion, they go out of their way to make it special."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate."}
{"text":"I came for my birthday and from beginning the service was excellent. They treated me like an all star and made my birthday wonderful. I love it!! Great job guys.."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for fathers day - so good - one of the best ribeyes I have ever had.  My parents loved it!  Salad with blue cheese and bacon was tasty as well.  Cant wait too go back"}
{"text":"Courtesy of @Shwaag, I dined at Fleming's with @CaymusCabernet, @RussellOnSteak and @MarianOnWine.

I should have written this sooner, but this is my 100th review, and I wanted to reserve that spot for this.

I attended an Interactive Wine Dinner, which was an amazing event, and I highly recommend attending one.

Our evening began with an amuse of Danish Bleu Cheese and Red Onion on Flatbread. The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!

This was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.

The combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!


Out next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets.
I'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.

This was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.

Paired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.


For the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes.
The strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish.
Simplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor.
The escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself)
The fingerling potatoes were perfect.
The bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.

Paired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.

The 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth.
The 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.

Both paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.


For dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream.
OMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.

Topped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.

As if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor.
Apricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.

An amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)

As if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.

How it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card.
I was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge)
I emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me.
Later in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.

Long story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.

Nobody does that. Ever.

Mike Head of Fleming's did.

He even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.

And after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return.
Mike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.

Thank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.

And thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)

If you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity."}
{"text":"I moved here from Chicago and I had to find a great steak house...I chose Flemmings because they were the only place around my area...I came in and I was seated right away even for a Saturday.  The waiter was so nice on top of everything and always checking on me to see how I was. The steak is perfect definitely to my liking. I felt like a princess how I was being treated. Will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for over 3 weeks for New Years night at 8:30. Get there and place is packed and told there would be a 45 minute delay! Why make a reservation?! Left and went to Preston's where they accommodated our 8 people with better food, drinks and service. Won't go back to Flemings."}
{"text":"Great happy hour burgers (comes with cheese and bacon if you choose) with fries :) for only $6!! can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Valley for 36 years and have been to all the major steak places.  Fleming's is the best!  I've never had a bad steak there - or bad salmon filet for that matter! And their Flemings potatoes are not to be missed--potatoes au gratin with a twist - jalapeno sauce - Yum! And the ambience is fabulous - rich woods and copper. Both elegant and intimate."}
{"text":"Bread is finally improved, so that gets things off to a better start.  Love the beef carpaccio, they do that really well here.  Had the Wagyu NY strip, excellent.  Creamed spinach here is super.  Excellent cheesecake to finish.  Great meal!"}
{"text":"I suggested Fleming's to my parents and grandmother. They've enjoyed their meals here but for some reason, weren't sure where to go that particular weekend. Looking back on the great experience, I'd guess that Scottsdale has far more good restaurants than I realize. 

Fleming's was very good and covered so many details. Seriously, more places should offer black napkins! Very personable service by the valet, greeter, hostesses and servers themselves. I felt valued as a customer when people referred to us by name.

My pork chop was only fair but that's based on my personal preferences. It was a double cut and as a result was a little undercooked for my liking. No worries, I just ate around the middle section. 

When I mentioned Fleming's to my friends later that night, they acknowledged it as a good choice and asked how I'd heard of it. Why am I still explaining Yelp to people? :)"}
{"text":"Flemings is my new favorite upscale steakhouse. Everything I have tried, literally everything, has been the best thing ever. Last night I took my parents here for Easter dinner. We started with the clam chowder soup, which was so creamy and chock-full of clams, we all were blown away. Next, we had wedge salads with crisp peppery bacon and the exact right amount of blue cheese.   The blue cheese dressing was a work of art.  After that came the prime rib dinner, 2 lobster tails, and filet mignon.  Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Finally, we shared two desserts: the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and the lava chocolate cake. These desserts were a perfect end to the meal with the exact right level of sweetness and a fabulous dish of chantilly cream as an accompaniment.  

Our server was knowledgeable and attentive without being invasive. They also take reservations which we appreciated. Flemings is a high-end restaurant, but our meal including tip was only around $250--so it didn't break the bank. We all left full and agreeing that the meal was worth the price."}
{"text":"One of the least satisfying dining experiences my wife and I have had in a long time.  My Philly steak sandwich must have sat under the heating lamp for way too much time and something as simple as a loaded baked potato was cold and tasteless.  My wife said her lobster tail tasted fishy and old and could not eat more than a few bites.  She also ordered creamed corn which was loaded with jalape√±o peppers which was not noted on the menu. We have been here before and never had a great meal, but  tonight was sub, sub par.  I suggest you go to the Capitol Grill where everything is always excellent."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for my March Birthday 
Thanks go manager Chris and Julio the server 
Amazing customer service!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there this past Sunday for the second time.  We went previously for my birthday and had a great experience.  The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the \"last call\" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.  

When the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time."}
{"text":"Top line service when you enter the restaurant and leaving the restaurant.
Our server Jordan was Great! 
Cheerful, Friendly and Helpful!
As always the food was Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"1st time ever disappointed with Flemings....we ordered baked brie as an appetizer and it was a solid chunk of cheese instead of melted and oozing like it should. the service was exceptional"}
{"text":"Don't order the prime rib empanadas!!  All dough and no meat!  You'll be happier getting a Jack in the Box taco!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Father's Day Brunch!

Bread, Wedge salad, Filet Benedict on buttermilk biscuits with hash brown potatoes and green beans, New York Style Cheesecake = $29.99 + They gave me a $25 gift card to come back for dinner!

Thanks Flemings!"}
{"text":"I can't say I'm a fan of Fleming's. Having dined at Mastro's on several occaisions we were comparing Fleming's to Mastro's and have to say I'd much rather dine at Mastro's.

It wasn't so much the food, in fact the food was quite good. The service is what was the biggest letdown. 

I ordered a wedge salad to start with since I'd seen a couple eating them at the bar while we were waiting for our table. The presentation was good as was the dressing and the blue cheese chunks but the majority of the lettuce was yellow and didn't taste good. My partner ordered the French Onion Soup and really enjoyed it. 

Next came the second round of drinks which took forever to arrive at the able. My guess would be at least 10 minutes although it seemed like 20.

For our entree's we both ordered NY Strips which were cooked exactly as ordered. For our side items we ordered creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms. Both were delicious. Unfortunately when we were done it took a long time to get the plates cleared. 

If you're looking for a GREAT deal on Prime Rib on Sunday nights head over to Temple Sports Bar at Thompson Peak and Bell in Scottsdale. Great service and the Prime Rib Special is only 12 bucks, yes that's right 12 bucks.

Ultimately it was the slow service that turned us off. If we're going to spend this much money I'd rather be showered with attention like you are at Mastro's."}
{"text":"Server is great! The clam chowder is really good. Wedge salad is very good as well. Fillet is good and the prime rib is just ok . The best part is the dessert - I love the lava cake."}
{"text":"This is not a real review but simply a comment about service.  I went to Flemings at DC Ranch this past weekend after a reception earlier that evening.  Because I had eaten earlier in the day and I was with a group of people I didn't plan on eating at Flemings but simply having a glass of Scotch on the patio.  
While we were being seated I asked someone who later I found out was the manager if he knew anywhere I might be able to find a cigar at this late hour of the evening.  We both speculated about the likelihood of some places in the vicinity being open and we both agreed that if would be a difficult task of finding someplace open nearby.  Upon which the manager  told me he personally did not smoke cigars but had one available that was a gift to him that he would be willing to give me.  I protested and was not willing to take a cigar from his personal property, but he insisted and I continued to offer my thanks but it was not necessary. I thought the matter was closed but a few minutes later he returned and placed the cigar, an ashtray and his business card down in front of me.  Impressive display of service.

You can be sure the next time I am looking for a good steak I will be thinking about Flemings at DC Ranch."}
{"text":"Poor service, starting with the incompetent, rude and narcissistic young woman who receives you, or not. Happy hour is poorly managed. I live in the area but prefer to drive away to a more welcoming place.  Is there a manager here? Will never return."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for great food and great service so I picked one of the most expensive restuarants in the area.  I can say I went to a steakhouse with good food, but there wasn't anything exceptionally great about Flemmings. If I was going to compare Flemmings to another restuarant it would be Oscars Steakhouse in Downtown Las Vegas with that \"Beef, Booze, and Broads\" feel.  Good steak, good drinks and even a waitress pumped full of botox. 

The food we tried included the calamari appetizer, wedge salad, swordfish, filet, crab, and asparagus side.  Everything was cooked as it should have been but again nothing that really made you say WOW after that first bite! They did have a great wine list with 100+ wines by the glass.  

Our service was excellent and everything was timed perfectly and our waitstaff was very attentive and ensured we had all we needed throughout the meal, including beverages.  

I may find myself back in Flemning but it will not be one of my top choices in the future."}
{"text":"We went here after watching some fancy cooking show. We inquired about a certain steak that is prepared a certain and drawn out way that wasn't on the menu. WE just happened to mention this and our waiter went and asked about it, Fantastic, So thankful this was the best dinner I have had In years! Actually the best steak of my life! Love this place!! So thoughtful and amazing that they could make this work although it wasn't on the menu!! Total kudos!"}
{"text":"Formerly my favorite special-night-out spot, Fleming's has disappointed as of late.  Had to send back overlooked, dry halibut last time and this time some very disappointing fleming's potatoes and prime rib.  The food is still acceptable overall, but for the price, I expect more.  Sorry Fleming's, I'll have to move on."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for the prime rib special.  I had the prime rib... My wife had the fillet.  I ordered my steak medium rare.  It came out medium well.  My wife ordered her steak medium and it came out medium well.  The server offered to send them back but that's how food gets spit on... so I don't do that... Not to say that they would spit on our food but I see no sense in taking the risk.  

A steak house that cannot prepare steaks to the requested doneness isn't worth its salt.  The service was decent.  Given this and my past experience I won't go back.  There are better options nearby at effectively the same price point."}
{"text":"If you're craving a juicy, aged steak cooked to perfection, and wonderful a la carte side dishes, call Fleming's for reservations. They are usually at full capacity, and you may wait for your food, but the servers are excellent, and it's a place to enjoy the ambiance and wine. The extensive wine list is on an interactive iPad that includes the wine ratings and pairing suggestions. Although, I usually prefer the filet mignon, the seafood is exceptional, and the apple-mustard pork chop is delicious, however I have found the chicken disappointing. The best sides to share are the Fleming's cheesy potatoes with jalapenos, Chipotle mac & cheese, creamed spinach, and grilled asparagus. It is also a nice place take someone for their birthday as Fleming's will present them with a small signature box of chocolates and gift card for return visit. One interesting note is that the well drinks have a large round ice cube, which although very trendy, it does fill the whole glass leaving very little of the pricy drinks. Steaks range from $40. to $60. and sides (for two) are $11."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best! Be sure to come in right at 5:00 because the seats fill up fast! Best part of happy hour, $1 an ounce for wine and the free, endless chips. My husband and I also enjoy the hamburgers. The wait staff is great too!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  I took my husband here for an early Fathers Day Dinner on Saturday night. We were seated right away and they honored our reservation request for a booth.  Our service was exceptional. The server knew her wines and her menu. She made excellent recommendations. Our food was delicious and the courses were brought out in a timely manner. We never felt rushed. 

We don't get out often without the kids and it is such a nice treat when everything goes well.  The hostesses and manager were also very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this restaurant and particularly this location."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Flemings location since it opened.  I have had mediocre service (and sometimes food) here before sitting at the bar and in the dining room, but for the most part, it is consistently better-than-average service. We sat at the bar for a light dinner and Mike was GREAT! Super personality and very attentive.  What an asset he is to Flemings!  Definitely makes us want to come back when he's there (on Sundays and ? bc he is pt) 

We always get the prime rib on Sundays or the NY strip, with either the Flemings potatoes-their jalapeno infused version of potatoes au gratin or the steak fries. The Flemings salad is good too. slightly sweet and served with a nice chilled fork.  The creamed corn also has a 'kick' to it.  The lava cake is decent and worth ordering if you still have room for it. 
 I can't say it's the best steak you will ever have, but for what it is, it's consistently good service/food and it's convenient....for us at least :)"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday dinner at Flemings and our waiter was nice including the manger that evening who was so nice and pleasant.  The hospitality was outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm typically skeptical of restaurants in hotels. But for some reason \"Prime Steakhouse\" was unusually alluring. 

We had a late reservation and we got seated fairly quickly. Our server Abram was really helpful and friendly. I got the Petit Fillet Mignon and it was so good! Pure meat cooked perfectly. A side of mashed potatoes and asparagus to share- this was a good meal. All the staff was really friendly to us; great service at Fleming's. 

Their wine list is on an iPad, which is pretty fun to play with too!"}
{"text":"A quintessential dining experience. A place, unlike many others that always gets it right...I have never had a poor experience dining here quantifying both food and service...sitting at a table or at the bar.

This evening I truly treated myself to something I simply never eat: twin lobster tails...Those two little babies came out of the shell and with drawn butter and with a side of creamed spinach..Let me tell you that it was to die for...

And then came dessert...Berries with chantilly cream...

For me and my stomach: it was an evening to remember: Thank you Flemings...."}
{"text":"I was impressed w/ Flemings! Gr8 steak place! The bartenders are fun! They have those wine glasses tht a whole bottle can fit into b/c we thought we were getting short a wine thy proved us wrong! I will b bk :o)"}
{"text":"3rd time here and everything perfect. We love this place! Strongly recommend the bone-in rib-eye served iron crusted style. Most excellent!!! Chocolate Martini perfect after dinner drink. Would be remiss if I didn't highlight server Erika. She was outstanding in every way. Props to the management team and the entire staff. You have a most special thing going here!"}
{"text":"I consider this fine dining which I do once a year for my birthday. The hostess and waiters greeted you by your party's name the entire night. A nice personal touch. The meal was definitely pricey, but the steaks alone made it worth it. The sweet chili calamari was good although it quickly became soggy from the sauce. We had two cocktails. Mine the blood orange sangria, was nice and strong. I had a New York strip and my date had a ribeye. We also shared a side of asparagus and diablo shrimp. The steak melted in my mouth. I couldn't finish it all, but boy was it good. *i made steak and eggs with the leftovers. The diablo shrimp fell short in my opinion. It had no flavor. Only the sauce which did nothing for me. 

It's my goal to try a different high end steakhouse every year. I've tried it so on to the next. I wouldn't voluntarily go back on my own, but if invited, I'd indulge."}
{"text":"Is it Five Star day or am I just in a good mood?

PF Changs...PeiWei...Teneko's...Flemings?

How does Fleming's fit in with the whole asian themed restaurant empire thingy that Peter Fleming put together?

I don't know...more importantly, I don't care...Fleming's Steakhouse is the best of the lot by my lights:)

Does Fleming's make the best steak in town? 

Well no, the best steak in town comes off my grill, when I'm in the mood to grill:)

But I'm not always in the mood to grill my own steak and when I'm not, Flemings consistently puts a very solid medium rare Rib Eye ( with a little salad and a few string fries) right in front of me (along with a couple of well made Grey Goose marti's:)

They do it in a friendly style with  exemplary and easy going service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere...lighter d√©cor than some of the very low lit/dark wood/red velvet steakhouses (BTW...not enough light to read the menu doesn't make the steak taste any better:)

Flemings has never done me wrong...

I have never felt \"optimized\" like I do at Ruth's Chris...I haven't felt that I overpaid for mediocre food like I do at Morton's or Mastro's...I never feel that I'm out of place when I show up wearing my shorts, sandals and golf shirt (exquisitely tailored, highly expensive shorts, sandals and golf shirt, but nevertheless:)

Flemings is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a steak:)

The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over the other evening, intending to take advantage of the current Happy Hour specials (5 items for $6...5 wines, 5 cocktails and five small plates, each priced at $6...all of which are phenomenal, BTW:)

But after a couple of well crafted and astonishingly cold marti's, we decided we wanted dinner:)

I had the bone in Rib Eye and Carin had the New York Strip (my girl likes her steak:)

We split some shoestring potatoes and grilled asparagus:)

Everything was essentially perfect...a little too much food, but we took it home and DeeDee continues to believe that we are The Best People Ever:)

The next time you're in the mood for steak and you don't feel like heading out to your grill on a balmy 112 degree Scottsdale evening, put on your shorts and golf shirt, slide into your sandals, get comfy in a booth at Flemings and build yourself a $200 credit card bill.

Hey, I never said they were cheap...just good!"}
{"text":"Gave 3 stars because I usually love Fleming's. Got my usual lemon drop no sugar and I was served something red. Told it was muddled. I have had this drink at 3 other Fleming's Fresno Las Vegas and  El Segundo. It never ever looked like that. So I asked for another and was told that's how it is supposed to look. Not drinking that. Got a plain vodka and left. Didn't go back the next night as I planned Afraid of more bad bar service.  First time ever at a Fleming's I will stick to other locations."}
{"text":"Wow! What service!! I stopped in right when they opened since I'm an ESTer and was ready for dinner!! The server went absolutely above and beyond, even to the point of getting me a blanket since he thought I might be cold! 

The food was equally as amazing. I had the filet with garlic mashed potatoes on this visit. The steak was a smidge overdone, but still incredibly flavorful. They serve the steak here on a SUPER hot plate, a couple of high end restaurants do similar servings. It's really an acquired serving preference, so if you're not a fan skip the steak.

I'd definitely go back and definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We love this Fleming's location!  We have been coming to it for years and have celebrated most of our anniversaries here.

I typically get the Ribeye.  This last trip they had a dry aged ribeye and it was delicious.  My husband loves the filet and lobster tail.  He said the lobster is the best he has ever had anywhere.  We always order the Fleming's potatoes which are so delicious.  Their desserts are wonderful too.  My husband's favorite is the creme brulee and mine is the chocolate lava.

The service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment...... I stopped in today for an early dinner while visiting Scottsdale. I have tried Fleming's before and had solid meals.

I ended up eating in the bar which almost requires a flashlight to see the menu. If the tv wasn't on, I would have needed my cell phone to see anything.

The service was fine. The bartender was attentive, nice.

I ordered several apps. They all were sub par. The first was barely lukewarm. The second one, pork belly, had potential. You could tell part of the plate was put together and was waiting for the pork belly. I didn't want to tell the bartender they were 0 for 2. The calamari showed up. It was warm but very overcooked in a puddle of some sweet sauce.

The meal did fill me up but if i had to do it over again, I would try a different place.

Plenty of parking outside.."}
{"text":"I'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal, but this place is top notch not only in service, but as well as quality of food. The fillet mijon was tasty, perfectly cooked (medium), and still sizzling hot on my plate. We ordered mac and cheese, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus for sides. Again, I cannot express the 5 star quality of food this place serves. To end our evening off, we ordered the chocolate lava cake. I'm don't have a sweet tooth whatsoever, but to see the hot chocolate oozing out of the middle of the cake with vanilla bean ice cream. WOW, my taste buds were in heaven. I will be coming back to this place sooner rather than later. Get the lava cake ready for me! This time I will make room to fit it all in my tummy."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Everything on the menu is fantastic. We finally got a chance to try their happy hour which was excellent as we'll."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening and dined on crab cakes, scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach. The restaurant is very well appointed, service was exceptional. This is a very expensive and lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"NOTE:  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DC LOCATION....NOT THE SCOTTSDALE RD. LOCATION.....THE MANAGER FOR THIS LOCATION WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL ME & WAS VERY CONCERNED, WHICH WAS NICE.

Terrible Happy Hour yesterday at Flemings.  We should have known it wouldn't be good when my husband ordered a Manhattan \"up\" and it was served in a champagne glass!  Did the bartender take Bartending 101?  The waiter asks \"what kind of garnish would you like in your Manhattans.....an orange peel?\" Ok, whatever.  Look at the picture of the calamari appetizer...we've had it before...really good sauce on it.  Ours was totally dry with NO SAUCE whatsoever....a few pepper slices thrown on it.  Then we got the burger and fries (Happy Hour), which also in the past has been very good.  Not this time!

The kicker was that they ripped us off with our gift card.  I gave them a $50 gift card that has never been used....THEY INFORMED US THAT IT ONLY HAD $30 ON IT!!!  Really???!!!  Course, how can we prove it?!

Never going back!  Glad my gift cards are finished!!  No more!!

No wonder the Happy Hour wasn't totally crowded like in the past!!!"}

I originally posted this on the incorrect Fleming's location.  Right away the Manager from the Scottsdale Rd location called me and was very concerned!  He said he would pass it on to the manager at this location and have him call me!!  I wonder if he will!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Not how I remembered the chain. Service seemed uninterested until they realized we were there for the full menu and not just happy hour.  

Appetizer was the burrata cheese.  Not good.

Medium rare rib eye was closer to medium and average quality.

The lady had scallops/shrimp dish.  Scallops were above average, but the shrimp was rancid.  Compliments to how they handled the situation.  Good apology, empathy and they took it off the bill.  

Can't hang as a steak house in this city (or any) if this is their best service. Dominicks beats it in every aspect."}
{"text":"Ate here for my first time two weeks ago and I have to say Flemings is one of my new favorite places to dine. I thought the ambiance was okay. The restaurant wasn't brand new and the bar area looked a little run down. So my guests and I decided to have dinner in the dining room. 
The entire night was fabulous!!! Our server (Joey) was very knowledgeable in every aspect of our dining experience. He suggested the chateau montelena cabernet with our steaks. He said the wine which he said had dark fruits and lingering finish was on the button. He suggested some  choice cuts of filet and ribeye. Well I have to say Joey, great recommendations! The servers service was flawless. Every course was timed out perfectly and came out how we modified them. The steak had a little too much butter on them, but were high quality beef. Our drinks were never short of full and the waiters personality was a blast. He then told us about Flemings happy hour and how we should not miss out. 
We will be back!

Service and food was delicious. Price was a little steep. All in all I give a 5 because its the best steakhouse I have been to. Bravo"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for happy hour for date night. The food was pretty good and we even had complimentary homemade potato chips. 

We ordered a few cocktails and they were great! 

Being located pretty far north Scottsdale, there isn't much of a crowd. It seemed pretty dead and I think that's how it usually is. Great place for date night!"}
{"text":"Giving it a 4 1/2 star rating but rounding up because it was NYE. 

Party of 4 of us. Had 7:45 reservations but it was NYE and it was packed as f. Didnt seat until 8:15 but we understood. It's arguably the busiest night of a restaurant year and we werent in a rush. So all good. 

Our waitress was a little frazzled from the evening i feel like. She seemed out of it and wasnt checking on a table like she should have. We did notice she had some \"difficult\" tables (basically people complaining left and right). 

The food was great though! Fresh bread was awesome. We ordered 3 steaks and the salmon. Everyone said their steak was fantastic and the gal ate her salmon faster than I could blink. 

All in all - I'll take amazing food and a little drop in service over any dining experience. We'll def return"}
{"text":"Prime for Prime Rib!  We once again had a fabulous dinner at Flemings.  During the summer months they offer Prime Rib Mondays-and at a reduced price.  Best deal in town.  Salad, Prime Rib, a side and dessert for less than $30.00.  UNBELIEVABLE!  Brandon, our server, was attentive but not intrusive-the perfect compliment to a delicious meal.  Every bite was bursting with flavor.  We also enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting and bought a delightful bottle as a result!"}
{"text":"I wish you were able to give a 1/2 star, because I'd only give this place 3 1/2 stars.  The only reason I went up to 4 is because of the good service.

Fleming's holds the reputation of being a high end restaurant....specifically a steakhouse.  The service and decor definitely portray that, but the food doesn't.  It's not terrible food....but it's nothing to rave about.  The steak was cooked according to my order, but the sides we ordered were bland.  I don't expect anything to be bland at a nice restaurant like this.

There are an overwhelming amount of options to choose from in places to eat.....I did not think this restaurant deserves their ranking.  Not a bad experience, and glad I was finally able to try it......but I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"I really can't understand how anyone can give this place less than at least 4 stars.  Yes, there are other \"better\" steaks in town, but this is pure consistency.

Ambiance, quality, flavors, service, amenities, patronage, menu options -- all are top class.

Anything dry-aged is fantastic because of the deeper, richer flavors that this technique summons from the beef.

The Fleming's potatoes are excellent -- surprisingly, they are even better the day after when you heat them up in the microwave.  

Yes, you will spend a lot of money when you come here, so don't be a chump and try to \"cheap\" your way through a meal.  Watching your wallet will simply dilute what otherwise should be an opulent and luxurious experience."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I absolutely hate to review any business less than 5 stars. But it is extremely necessary in this circumstance. 

My fianc√© and I had a reservation on New Years Eve. We expected the place to be packed which it was. We didn't expect to be seated right away I understand that people linger on holidays. What I didn't expect was that they were an hour and a half behind on reservations. I really wasn't even mad about that. We had several interesting conversations with other couples that were waiting so the time passed by pretty quickly. 

What was really frustrating is we were sitting there for a long time. So I watched every person check in. We were also chit chatting with everyone so I knew what time each persons reservation was supposed to be at. 

Two tables were open in the bar (with the white table cloth is how they described it) for a very long time these tables sat empty. Fast forward 45 minutes and the hostess asked a gentleman sitting next to me if he would like to take the table in the bar. He declined and waited for a dining room table. He was there with his girlfriend...so a table for 2 just like us. But his reservation was 30 minutes after us and he checked in way after us. The difference is he complained about the wait time. So they were trying to seat him before us. 15 minutes later the hostess offered my fianc√© and I that table. We took it. 

No apologies for the wait. 

Our server came over to greet us and said \"I've been telling them to seat people in here all night\"

Everyone waited a long time New Year's Eve so obviously there is mismanagement on reservations. But I watched them seat people in a very confusing order. And I was extremely mad they were going to seat a reservation 30 minutes after us. We should have been offered that option first. 

To make matters worse I watched a manager yelling at a server right next to our table. Then to make it extremely worse the couple that complained about the wait got part of their meal comp'd. 

Our reservation was at 915 we were seated at 1030. No apologies nothing at all. 

Food was great. Amazing even. Our server was fabulous. But I will never go back. I've never seen such disorganization."}
{"text":"Flemings must have the best service in this town! We came in early for HH. Kris bounded over with a huge welcoming smile to get us seated and comfortable on the spacious patio. Next, he introduced us to our waiter Doug Ray. Even though it started to get busy he never forgot about us checking with us frequently to make sure all was going well. What a gracious guy!! Then Prentice came to inquire if everything was AOK. The food was awesome, but one thing;if you want onion rings on the burger you have to ask now. Come on over. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Absolutely positively the best meal I've had in a while! Loved this place! The staff was very friendly, quick to respond and catered to all our needs. I stopped by since it was connected to the Hilton hotel I was staying at and wished it was open for lunch so I could of eaten there instead of the hotel lol. First things first, the bread and specialty butters were delicious. We kept ordering more. I believe it was sourdough but the cr√®me cheese butter with herbs was sooo good. 

My coworker and I were craving salmon but the only version they had was BBQ'd. Yuck. We wanted it grilled Cajun style. The restaurant customized it and it was fantastic! The perfectly, seasoned salmon was super crispy on the outside and buttery, flaky soft in the inside. They were very generous with it as well since we each got 2 fillets. I've gone before in Boston and in Los Angeles but never tried the fish. Their steaks (Delmonico is my fav) is delectable as well.

My only regret with the visit was that we were too full, probably from all the bread, that we didn't get desert. Also, be warned that this place is very expensive and will only go back if my company pays for it again or somebody sends me a gift card haha."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints and the staff is professional without being stuck up. One of those meals you don't feel bad about spending your money on.

The seafood tower is a must!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Zach was an excellent waiter tonight! The food was the best! I had a great time here! Prime rib was superb!!! Love it! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Fleming's has always been one of my go-to steak restaurants here in the Scottsdale area. I go to this one as well as the one in DC Ranch. They have excellent steaks seafood appetizers and desserts. They also have two daily happy hours from 3 till 7 and 8 till 10. Good drink and food specials. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for some good food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent place for atmosphere food and drinks. Great steaks and I love their chocolate lava cake. Also have a great happy hour daily from 5 to 7 & 8 to 10. Great drink and food specials."}
{"text":"When you dine at Flemings, not only are you going for the food, but you're also going to the entire dining experience, and out of the handful of times that I have dined there I would have to say last night was our best dining experience to date. Our servers name was Andy, and he did a wonderful job, my Mom and I both left feeling like our money was well spent and worth our time. Instead of going to any other Flemings we would chose to go back to that location just to have Andy serve us again! He made sure we were well taken care of and our food was prepared to our liking, so thank you Andy, we will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for dessert. Well, I have to say that the Lava Cake was really good, but the staff wasn't. Our waitress was surprised and a little bit bothered that we were there just for dessert, and she wasn't really friendly too. I am a server as well, and I always take extremely care of my customers, with big smiles, prompting service, and my own personality. Especially in a classy place like this one, I would expect better staff. Concluding, 3 stars just for the Lava Cake."}
{"text":"I love dinners with the clients.  There are always at least 3 courses, several bottles of wine and no expenses are spared.  

We all agreed the steaks were like \"budda\" the were so melt in your mouth.  They had some wonderful wine suggestions for with the meal.  But what I remember most was the tuna appetizer.  For some reason it just really stuck with me.  

The setting is beautiful and while it was more loud than I anticipated, we could still fairly easily all 6 members of our party.  

it's a bit of a drive and not exactly for the cost conscious.  So I doubt I'll be going there any time too soon on my own.  But I anxiously look forward to the return of those clients so I can enjoy all Fleming's has to offer for free."}
{"text":"OK, a lobster cobb salad for over $30 and one of the very best prime rib dinners I have EVER eaten (also over $30)...  If I had the time and the money, I could LIVE here.
Sure we waited.  We waited long time. But Flemings love us long time too.

The calamari appetizer was cooked to perfection, and the special lobster bisque was equally incredible.  Our server was kinda hot, very eloquent, and easily served our table of twelve with no issues.

My biggest issue was with the party I was with because they simply didn't want to leave...  

One of the greatest tourist restaurant experiences ever.

HOWEVER...  I have to ding this establishment a star for not having free/any wifi...  Because that's how we roll in the new millennium...

Try the pomegranate margarita.  SERIOUSLY."}
{"text":"We returned as guests of Darrin's, a managing partner. The first thing I will say is the service here is the absolute best! From the minute we arrived till we left everything was great. Our waiter Jason was amazing, warm and friendly and so very knowledgeable; he had great suggestions. We enjoyed the 2 choices of butter with the bread and probably ate more bread than we should have. The modern caesar is delicious especially with the dried prosciutto chips and my husband enjoyed the huge, new wedge. We both had the 16 oz. dry aged seared rib eye both ordered medium rare. I felt my steak was cooked perfectly but my husband's was a little more towards medium but both of us thought the steaks were delicious and tender. We also had the brussel sprouts which are amazing and the chipotle mac and cheese was probably one of the best we've had in a long time; very cheesy with a wonderful panco crust. For dessert we shared the chocolate molten lava cake and requested the salted caramel ice with it instead of the vanilla since the caramel is so very good. and it went great together. It was warm with lots of rich chocolate pouring out from the inside, topped with their chantilly creme.  They have an extensive wine and spirits list with some hard to find items. this was certainly a much better experience than our last visit but I can definitely say again that their customer service is the very best. Our waiter was so sweet that before we left he gave us a box of their truffles to take home which were very good. I think the one we enjoyed the most was the smores truffle. A very enjoyable night."}
{"text":"We returned last night to give Fleming's another try and we were very pleased. The service was great, very relaxed atmosphere, much quieter and cleaner than on Easter. Our server, Erica, who was excellent gave us a great suggestion on having our steaks with the pan seared crust which was delicious. My husband had the bone-in New York strip which was huge and I tried the dry-aged ribeye which was probably one of the best steaks I ever had. Both were cooked to perfection. We had the grilled asparagus for our side, a great compliment to our meal. My mother has one of their small plates, the filet mignon, which was the perfect size for smaller appetites and she loved it. Erica also suggested the chocolate lave cake for dessert which was decadent and perfect finish to a great dinner."}
{"text":"As always....Flemings was perfect.  Go here in Scottsdale and La Jolla---always perfect!  Best steak ever...and I know a chain..but seriously amaze! :)  If there's a Flemings around--I never seek out another steak place because we have a great time always.  Even saw TW and Wil Ferrel one night at La Jolla..hahaha ;)"}
{"text":"Very good steaks and services  5 stars .we just love it, and defiantly will come back again ."}
{"text":"We had such a mixed review experience here tonight.  Sea bass was amazing and perfectly prepared.  My spouse had a meal of marginal scallops and shrimp (2 each is not a meal) and clam chowder that was like glue with corn and no clams.  We have had much better food in the past. This place is slipping."}
{"text":"I've been to Flemings for happy hour several times and every time it's been great ! The burgers are by far the best I've had. My husband i decided to try dinner at Flemings this past weekend and i was shocked about how mediocre the food was and the wait time for our food. It took us over an hour and half in and out of the restaurant. Our order was simple the tomato and mozzarella salad split ~ The salad was simple, the balsamic reduction was good , but nothing to rave about ,then again it's not tomato season.  I order a petite filet medium and my husband the bone in filet medium rare. It took over an hour to get our steaks. We where at the point to grab our check and go have dinner somewhere else. The server was very accommodating and said the kitchen staff was behind , he send the manager to our table who was apologetic . We are very easy customers and kept our frustration to ourselves because who knows who's fault it was.  The steaks came my steak was medium rare , which I most cases I can handle it if the steak is flavorful. The beef wasn't sweet, it     didn't have anything to it at all. It's funny because my husband said if you dip it in a sauce its better. That's not the point of having a good steak. My husband loved his bone in Filet, I tried it and it was better than mine for sure. I don't know if he loved it so much because he was super hungry. Regardless, Flemings ended up paying for our dinner, but I have to say, I can't say I would go back for a steak dinner. It's too bad ."}
{"text":"This place is WAY over priced!  I had the 6 oz. Porcini dusted filet mignon.  The description read, with high country asparagus spears and Goronzola cream sauce.  There were 3 thin asparagus spears and maybe a tablespoon of the Goronzola (sp) sauce.  I ordered it pink in the center and it came out red.  It was tasty but not the melt in your mouth steak that I had expected for $42.95.  I also ordered Flemings potatoes for $10.95.  They made the meal!  Potatoes were delicious!  Unless I have a coupon, I don't think I will go back.  MAYBE for happy hour."}
{"text":"The service there is the best!  

Took the wife there for her birthday and they made sure that is was AWESOME!!!

Our server Justin was very helpful and was johnny on the spot with the food and drinks.

Speaking of drinks, you know it's great service when your glass is always full.

Their special right now with 8oz filet and lobster tail was very filling and barely had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Once again, Fleming's was the PERFECT place to celebrate a special event. Brian R was one of the best servers we've had anywhere! Everything was perfect, the food was amazing (main filet mignons, Fleming's Potatoes, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Carrots) and we had the Chocolate Mousse Cake for dessert. I beg Fleming's to add this to their dessert menu permanently, it was amazing and had no nuts! Thanks again for another incredible celebration, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Quality of steak was nothing to write home about. Service was just ok. For what we got the price was very very high. I would never go there again."}
{"text":"My husband & I went there on a Saturday night after I left a bridal shower we were in town for.  I picked up my hubby @ the hoteI for a little bit of a romantic date & found Fleming's on YELP.  We arrived about 9pm & sat at the bar.  WHAT A DELIGHT!  They have an amazing wine list on ipads for you to peruse.  Very informative & includes numerous pairing possibilities for every item on the list.  The small plates are perfect for a late night bite & more than enough for me as an entree'. We paired the dessert with the reccommended port & all I can say is it was heavenly!  Our server was absolutely fantastic!  Attentive & personable.  Such an enjoyable evening we can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"The food and service are superb! This is the place to go if you are celebrating a life event or just want to be spoiled."}
{"text":"High end steak house in the Hilton Village. Expected great service and food, was not disappointed. 

Had ordered the Prime Rib Special. Comes with Salad, Prime Rib and dessert. For the dessert the Chocolate Lava Cake is awesome being served hot with vanilla ice cream. When we first had it the price was $29 and now is pushing $40.

The Prime Rib is generally prepared exactly the way you request. Top quality meats with exceptional service.

We generally celebrate some occasion here so we have about 20 people which they give us a private room.

Important tip, buy the Flemings Gift cards at Costco.  $79 gets you $100 worth of food.

First class all the way, will be back again."}
{"text":"I almost never eat steak.  When the mood strikes, this is where I usually come.  I like the atmosphere, the prices are fair, and the food and service are great."}
{"text":"I just wanted to take a moment and express what an incredible experience my daughter and I had at this establishment. I had made a reservation, indicating I was bringing her in for dessert for her 13th birthday. The hostess, server, assistant and manager all made sure to wish her a happy birthday, as well as brought her a card signed by the staff.  Even though we were not drinking or ordering entrees (aka - small bill), our server provided exceptional service. He even brought my daughter a box of wrapped truffles. This added touch - on top of all the other well wishes, service and card, completely blew us away. Of course, the dessert was fantastic as well. The chocolate lava cake and creme br√ªl√©e were some of the best I have had. And the basil pear drink - mmmmmm! This was our first experience at Flemings, but it certainly will not be the last!  Well done!"}
{"text":"A fairly well realized monument to unabashed corporate card excess, Fleming's dutifully enables the expense account crowd.       

Food and service are sporadic and a poor value for anyone silly enough to be spending their own money here. My wife's tuna steak looked pretty, but was tough and fibrous. Salmon was satisfactory, but I can make better at home.   Underlings fully invested in steak grunted unanimous satisfaction at the appropriate times. 

A hostess and bartender were both pleasant, charming even, however table service can be embarrassingly gushy (another reviewer mentioned ass-kissing).  This is the kind of place where bringing a pile of onion rings or a lettuce wedge to the table takes three chattering sycophants. We endured a flowery speech and unsolicited updates on lava cake, until it finally arrived half an hour after entrees were cleared. Hardly worth a wait. 

The whole meal took forever, which in an attractive, upscale room is often confused with fine dining. Paul Fleming is a respected restauranteur, and rightly so based on my visits to his other kitchens. But I am not that confused."}
