{"text":"Le restaurant Le Nil Bleu est non seulement très bien décoré, mais il possède également un service impeccable, rapide et des plats savoureux qui font de cette première rencontre avec la cuisine éthiopienne, une expérience formidable.  Bravo et a très bientôt"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ma visite au resto Nil Bleu! Une amie m'avait parlé de cet endroit avec grand enthousiasme et je n'ai pas été déçue.  Quel plaisir de manger cette délicieux nourriture à la façon des Éthiopiens...avec les mains! Pour goûter au maximum de plats, il est agréable de partager avec tous les gens autour de la table. Soyez sans crainte si votre voisin de table n'est pas passé à la salle de toilettes pour se savonner les mains, une serviette humide vous sera apportée avant le repas."}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely loved our meal here. I'm a bit of an Ethiopian aficionado and everything we tried was delightfully on point. We ate a fairly substantial amount and yet felt light and energized afterwards. What a great find."}
{"text":"We eat at the Nil Bleu every time we are in Montreal. We've always had a good, reasonably priced meal. The food is much better than some of the Ethiopian restaurants in our local area. We've introduced several people to the restaurant and all have been pleased."}
{"text":"Fancy looking place with apparently no Ethiopian staff or patrons (BAD signs).  Food is meh.   Bland and oily.  Very stingy with the Injara bread. Ok if you want fancy or something different, but don't bother if you want good Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! Went there for my 3 year anniversary with my bf and the food was amazing!!! If you like trying different kinds of food, then this place is a must. You eat with your hands which is different when you're so use to eating with utensils but really fun!!!"}
{"text":"pricey ethiopian food.  very dark interior.  slow service."}
{"text":"I have to order dinners for an office of 7+ people every night. I've tried working around Nil Bleu's needs for take out but the last time I went it was a nightmare. They refused to take my order unless I signed up for Justeat. Even when I can there in person. They tried to shoe me away by lying and saying the manager wasn't there, and then later saying they were too busy to take my order (it was 5pm and they had 0 customers). After arguing with them for about 10 minutes, they reluctantly agreed to make an exception and do me the favor of ordering food. Dealing with them has been such a pain I wont be back and neither will anyone else from my office. Worst service and mediocre food that doesn't travel well. Most of the dishes are hit or miss."}
{"text":"Amazing Ethiopian food. If you re trying for the first time you gotta order the sample meal for 2 or 4 people."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance at this restaurant -  large beautiful tables and African-themed art throughout. The service was fast and friendly - but we were there on a Monday night, so not very busy. I shared the veggie platter, which was quite large and more than enough for two, and came with fresh salad, a couple of lentil/split pea stews, a chunkier potato and carrot dish and a sauteed dish of spinach/onion/garlic. The food was great. Would've preferred a bit more spice - but everything on the platter was excellent. Veggie platter for two came to about $35 all together."}
{"text":"After writing to the manager about my bad experience, he sent me an apology on behalf of his staff so I withdraw my negative review. There was no compensation offered."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 5 but the service was too much of an issue. This place is located on a pleasant, easily accessible street. Parking isn't difficult to find. The decor of this place is stunning: a modern interpretation of authentic Ethiopian ambiance. The walls are covered with paintings depicting rural Ethiopia and many chairs are covered with a zebra-patterned fabric. We were greeted after a short wait until we were told that our table (that we had reserved a few hours back) was not ready. Instead of apologizing, they sat us down in the hotel sitting room next door which was cramped. We sat there in silence for 10 minutes until a waitress came over with water. While this was a nice gesture, it was inappropriate that we waited for 20 minutes after our reserved time. And then when we were seated, they placed us downstairs, right next to the bathroom... Anyway, the service was progressively better as the night went on. The menu is quite interesting, but I would recommend the traditional family platters over individual entrees. We began with the vegan appetizer, which consisted of chickpea puree with eggplant, garlic and lemon dip, tomato salad, and an amazing eggplant dish. Everything was served with injera, or soft, sponge-like bread. This was fantastic; I'm not a fan of tartar, so this was perfect. The eggplant was so juicy and filling, while the dips were extraordinary. We then got the meat entree, which had at least 6-7 different dishes on it. According to the website, the meat plate consists of \"Yatakelt watt : cabbage, potatoes and carrots sauteed Yebeg Key Watt: Moist Lamb cooked in berbere sauce Gommen : Spinach with onion and garlic Doro Watt : Chicken with berbéré sauce Bedergan : Zucchini in our special alicha sauce Zilzil Tibbs : Filet mignon strips sauteed with ginger Digestives: Tejje, Traditional digestive made out of Honey.\" Every meat entree had its own unique flavor. The lamb was absolutely incredible, served in a somewhat spicy, herb-infused sauce. The chicken was fantastic as well. Their sides were surprisingly as good as the meat. And once you finished all of the meat, more injera. Everything, except for the service, was absolutely amazing, so I definitely recommend this place if you don't come on a busy Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I've eaten (and, for the most part, enjoyed) Ethiopian restaurants in several cities worldwide, and Nil Bleu is a great one. The flavours were a little less strong than in other Ethiopian establishments I've visited, but the quality was solid and the whole experience enjoyable. They put a little more care into presentation than we're used to (from a flower presented on the plate with the kitfo, to an incongruous salad in the centre of the tasting plate, right on the injera). In all, a worthwhile visit."}
{"text":"Malgré le fait que Montréal soit une ville multiculturelle aux milles et une couleurs, il est relativement rare de trouver un endroit où l'on peut savourer l'authentique cuisine africaine. Le Nil Bleu est l'un de ces restaurants où l'expérience vaut la peine!  Attablés, vous serez encouragés à goûter la nourriture éthiopienne avec vos mains!...ce qui, indéniablement, marquera votre soirée... L'expérience est d'autant plus stimulante qu'elle contraste franchement avec l'exotique décoration très class et artistiquement recherchée. Rarissimes sont les restaurants où la tribalité rencontre aussi bien la gastronomie. Et si l'on a la bosse de découvertes culinaires, il est franchement préférable de s'en tenir aux assiettes-combo qui vous permettront d'explorer les explosions d'assaisonnements inhabituels à la cuisine occidentale. Le Tibbs vous surprendra!  Principalement composée de viandes, à savoir, le poulet, le buf et l'agneau, les végétariens pourront aussi y trouver leur compte dans les lentilles et les légumes. En tout cas, végétarien ou pas, il vous faudra découper manuellement un morceau de l'immense crêpe de farine (assez fade et bourrative) qui occupe le centre de la table et par la suite déposer les aliments choisis dessus. Cette tradition éthiopienne vise le rapprochement et le partage!  Carte des vins très exhaustive, allant du californien jusqu'à l'Africain...  Incontournable: le café éthiopien, servi dans une traditionnelle cruche, accompagné du gâteau à la noix de coco...  Ne transférez pas à la fourchette au cours du repas!..."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a lot of Ethiopian restaurants but this is by far the bet I've had. Delicious meal in a great city."}
{"text":"I am in love with the Ethiopian food the spicy taste is excellent but lately  this  restaurant dishes shrunk to become little drop for each dish displayed in a big piece of bread injera , they became like a French restaurant besides they have plenty of very tasty vegetarian food that they could offer plentiful and they offer them in a very small quantity that is one bite each dish , the place very cosy and excellent for everyone but they changed from the past where food was real Ethiopian !"}
{"text":"There is this tree just inside the women's washroom. One of the branches poked around the door as I was opening it and hit me right in the eye. Pretty idea, poor execution. I was here for a private party and the servers were severely overworked. Despite the little annoyances of eye pokes and slow service, the food wasn't bad. Overall, the okay food didn't save the evening but two stars for ambiance!"}
{"text":"Upscale, tasty food. Enjoyed our visit! We had the meat options for two and were extremely pleased. The staff was helpful."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. Staff was very courteous. We tried tasting menu for 2 with mix of vegan and meat options, impressed."}
{"text":"Par où commencer ? Vous n'êtes pas du genre à essayer de nouvelles choses dans la vie ? Vous êtes une personne routinière qui transpire dès qu'elle doit sortir le moindrement des sentiers battus ? Si c'est le cas, ce n'est pas répréhensible, mais disons que, lorsque vous sortez, vous devriez vous en tenir à St-Hubert et Mikes (que j'aime bien, ceci dit, mais vous comprendrez qu'ici, ces deux restos ne sont utilisés qu'en exemples de bouffe passe-partout).  Pour ceux qui aiment tenter de nouvelles expériences, le Nil Bleu est parfait. Restaurant éthiopien très chic (mais pas trop cher, quand même), avec une décoration exceptionnelle (même les toilettes valent le détour, possiblement les plus belles toilettes de restaurants de Montréal !), le Nil Bleu propose des tables d'hôte franchement succulentes et une ambiance qui se prête à la fois à des rendez-vous galants ou à des sorties entre amis. Je ne saurais trop quoi suggérer sur le menu : tout est bon. J'y suis allé deux fois et ai essayé un peu de tout.  Avertissement aux gens qui sont dédaigneux : les plats sont présentés sur une sorte de crêpe qu'on utilise pour enrouler les morceaux de viande et les légumes qui sont déposés sur cette pâte. Il faut donc manger avec ses mains et on partage la crêpe avec les autres. Comme je l'ai dit : parfait en couple ou entre amis. Peut-être moins avec votre patron ou collègue que vous trouvez un peu grossier et avec qui vous allez manger un midi, faute d'avoir trouvé compagne ou compagnon plus agréable."}
{"text":"Restaurant is located conveniently in the heart of downtown Montreal. Public street parking is usually available in front of the hotel and will cost 5cents per minute.   Food is great! We tried the Vegan platter and added Doro Wot (Chicken) and Lamb Tibbs to it. Made our own Tasting Menu. (they have a tasting menu option costs $60 but we didn't go for it because it contained meat options that we dont eat). The platter is a sharing type containing a an Injera, all the curries are put on top of the Injera and they give you more Injera as you need.   Tasty!"}
{"text":"Third time having Ethiopian food was the charm: I fell for this place. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal - have been a couple of times since my first visit and I am aiming to go back again. Ambiance is trendy-yet-cozy, the fruity cocktails delicious, and the vegan platter to die for. Short walking distance from the Sherbrooke metro station is super convenient. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfect dish! We ordered the tasting menu which could give you a general tour of Ethiopian food, Vegetarian choices were the best, and dessert were also fancy."}
{"text":"Un super restaurant ! Une cuisine original et goûteuse, une régularité et un service impeccable. Nous sommes des habitués, ce soir pour une fois nous avons choisi de commander en livraison, après une petite erreur vite corrigé, nous avons eu une super expérience !"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to. And that includes Ethiopian places in Toronto, Buffalo NY, and Washington DC. The Blue Nile is pretty upscale for an Ethiopian restaurant, which makes eating there something of an event.   I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian food. The food here wasn't particularly spicy, even the food that the waiter said would be spicy. But what it lacked in heat, it made up for in taste. The meat dishes were terrific but the real stand outs were the veggie dishes. The caramelized veggies (okra, eggplant, onions) was so good. The chick pea dish (what the waiter called Ethiopian humus) was sublime. Even the injera tasted better than most I've had.  If you enjoy Ethiopian, or if you just want to enjoy something new, this is a place to try."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the city for one main reason: their eggplant puree is devine! Offer many vegan options and everything is bursting of flavour!"}
{"text":"La décoration est à couper le souffle! Une décoration allant jusqu'aux toilettes... Pour ce qui est du repas, on a été plusieurs à avoir eu mal au ventre. Est-ce du au repas, un virus contagieux? ... Quoi qu'il en soit, ce fut une cuisine originale (car étiopienne) qui sort de l'ordinaire à manger avec les doigts. Cependant, ce fut bourratif... Par contre, je veux quand même finir comme j'ai commencé par la décoration qui est tout juste sublime!"}
{"text":"Superbe restaurant au décor éclectique, situé au rez-de-chaussée d'un hôtel. Le décor fit plus ou moins avec le genre de menu, mais c'est très classe : banquettes en cuir blanc, une chute d'eau dans l'escalier vers le sous-sol, des éléphants, un grand piano. Vous aurez un choc en allant a la salle de bain, on se croirait dans le château de cendrillon, haha. Un homme joue du piano en soirée, c'est sublime comme ambiance.   Le service est impeccable, rapide, courtois. La nourriture est bonne, je ne saurais comparer avec autre chose, c'est le seul restaurant éthiopien ou j'ai mis les pieds, mais nous aimons vraiment le concept. Avis : allez y avec des amis avec qui vous vous sentez a l'aise, car vous pigerez probablement dans les mêmes plats, et on mange avec nos mains. Le poisson était FABULEUX. Les plats variés étaient aussi bons, mais c'est dur de faire la différence entre le boeuf et l'agneau tant les épices sont présentes.   Je retournerai la sans problème, même si le prix est élevé. Pour une occasion spéciale ou pour simplement essayer quelque chose de différent !"}
{"text":"We had Blue Nile delivered to our hotel after a long day of holiday travel. The food was fine, probably would be much better (hotter, less oily) had we been at the restaurant. I did get frustrated with the lack of utensils or napkins sent with our order. I'd try them again, but probably only in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Malgré un service déplorable serveur pas souriant et pas aimable, 10 demandes pour une carafe d'eau, serveur aussi à jouer sur leur cellulaire. la nourriture y est bonne et épicé, ( même si mon estomac à eu du mal à digérer)   pleines de saveur, possibilité de manger végé. Lavage des mains obligatoire. Une deco superbe"}
{"text":"J'ai toujours voulu essayer la cuisine Ethiopienne et Oh my Gosh je n'ai definitivement pas été déçue! Mon chum et moi avons pris l'aperitif vegetarien et le plat principal avec viandes. Ça n'a pas l'air, mais les portions sont quand même grandes pour deux! Les prix ne sont pas les plus abordables (30$ par personne) mais honnêtement pour le service et le décor je ne regrette absolument pas."}
{"text":"Si vous souhaiter être dépaysé c'est l'endroit, tel un restaurant sur le bord du désert en Éthiopie.  La décoration est superbe et le menu l'est tout autant, ici on mange avec les mains avec un pain semblable au pita (appelé ingera)  mais avec une texture semblable à une éponge absorbant les saveurs exquises du succulent menu.   Je vous suggère le menu dégustation ou vous pourrez déguster tout les mets exquis que ce restaurant offre. Tout la nourriture est très fraiche ici.   If you wish to be elsewhere in the world this is the place to go, it will take you to Ethiopia, Africa.   The food is as good as the decoration, here you eat with your hands with a like pita bread (call ingera) but with a sponge quality that absorb all the food taste.   I suggest you take the tasting menu that enable you to taste all the good food in this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. Been coming here sporadically over the years and although there have been changes in décor (including completely transparent frosted window stalls in the women's bathroom - beware. Owners, please reconsider), the food is still excellent. Separate menu for vegans makes ordering easy. They even have vegan cheesecake. Great service too."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out Ethiopian food. I really enjoyed the dining experience. We were 4 people and we ordered the tasting menu for about 30$ per person. It came with an appetizer and then the main course. The main course was delicious with interesting flavours. The dishes require one to eat with their hands. There were 4 different assortments served with crepe-like tortillas. I really liked the fish. We also asked for desert, but i did not enjoy that very much."}
{"text":"Friendly service, lovely interior, good food with generous portions.  We found that getting a tasting menu for 3 was plenty of food for 5 of us.  Fun place for a festive evening with friends."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here because we wanted to try Ethiopian cuisine. When you walk in, it's absolutely beautiful. I felt like I walked into a really nice mansion, at one point.   We ordered the veg appetizer, meat and veg platter along with homemade cakes. The platter was a good way for us to try everything. My absolute favourite was the lamb in berebere sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the other 5 options on the Injera. The Injera was everywhere, but absolutely amazing. The platter is also a hands on experience - no utensils needed. We also ordered a few of their variety desserts. I got the dark chocolate cake - on a stick. I wasn't a fan. Not sweet, with mild chocolate taste. I also ordered the Honey Wine. Very neat, and not as sweet as I expected.  The servers were really helpful with our orders. They were polite, but I did feel a little rushed near the end. Overall, I think it was good to go try it once in your lifetime."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. We've been a few times, and it never disappoints. I'm a vegetarian, and there are a few great options for me but the vegan platter to share is the best! We've also tried a few appetizers, drinks, and desserts, and it's always great."}
{"text":"Une experience hors du commun et un restaurant bon, pas cher et chaleureux comme on les aimes ! Nous avons éssayé le nil bleu, car des  amis nous en avait parlé et nous avons adoré !   Le menu degustation est 60$ pour deux !!! Oui vous avez bien compris 30$ chacun , c'est PARFAIT ! De plus, les portions sont énorme et la nourriture est excellente !  Le fait de manger avec ses mains est très cool aussi"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Ethiopian food by my sister. Together we have sampled some incredible dishes from LA, DC, Pittsburgh, Boston, and now, Montreal.   Le Nil Bleu had the best vegetarian platter I've ever tasted. There wasn't a whole lot of variety, but the dishes they included were thoughtfully curated to fit my taste: stewed collard greens, yellow split peas, lentils, and sweet cabbage and potato. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the house made injera further emphasized the scratch made quality of the dishes.   If you are concerned about sharing food while eating with your hands, there is no double dipping here because everything is pre portioned out for two. They did offer to bring us more injera, but we refused it. My favorite part is peeling the bottom layer that the food sits upon. The spongy, porous flat bread soaks up all that yummy spicy goodness. It's a huge bonus."}
{"text":"Try the tasting menu if you have never had Ethiopian food before.   The Vegan appetizer with the chick peas puréed with garlic and lemon and the eggplant marinated and puréed are both outstanding.   Be prepared to use your hands.  The meat is delicious and tender.  It is spicy, but not overpowering.  It has been a while since I have tried something so different and LOVED it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service, the ambiance and most  of all the food is great.  Everything is super fresh and amazingly tasty  I recommend it and cant wait to return  Try the lemon with coconut drink. The veggie platter.  That spongy bread is sooo good.  i loved everything i ordered  Service was really nice"}
{"text":"What. An. Amazing. Experience.  This place is elegant, classy, and charming. I read that the service was terribly slow and expected just that, but it was friendly, helpful, and quick instead. None of us really knew what would be best to order, so our server suggested we get a plate that is not on the menu that provides about 80% of authentic Ethiopian food. It gave us the chance to taste majority of the flavours and satisfy our curiosity!  First they brought out a vegetarian plate that had 3 items - spicy diced tomatoes, an interesting spin on hummus with eggplant, and sauteed mixed vegetables. It's presentation was remarkable, it tasted phenomenal, and was a great start to this foodieventure.  Then they brought out a large silver tray with portions of lamb, filet mignon, beef, and chicken. In between these portions were other vegetarian options like spinach tossed with onions, lentils, salad, and a pea-puree. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection.   Absolutely. Everything. Promise.  Now, what makes this one-hell-of-an-experience is the rolled up pancake looking bread that you use to pick up all these rich flavours. You eat every bite with your hands and really get in to it with no shame.   I paired my meal with a glass (or 3) of their Shiraz and was pleasantly satisfied with how it complimented the meal perfectly."}
{"text":"You need to go there everything is good . Le décor l'ambiance la serveuse tout guys you need to go there"}
{"text":"Cusine simple et délicieuse. Abordable. Bon service."}
{"text":"On our first night in Montreal, we decided to get Ethiopian food for dinner on a suggestion of a friend. The Blue Nile Restaurant offers vegan/vegetarian options as well as beef, lamb and chicken dishes, so there is something for everyone!   The drinks looked delicious and fruity and were pretty inexpensive at $8 Canadian. I had the safari, and it was fruity, as was expected. My friend and I shared the eggplant appetizer, which was delicious and then a chicken and a beef dish. The chicken and beef were served on a large platter with the Ethiopian spongey crepes and a little fresh salad in the middle.   I liked the chicken a lot more than the beef, it fell off the bone and the sauce was excellent. All the dishes come with the crepes, and maybe they don't eat rice in Ethiopia, but I wish there was a different kind of starch...   The service was excellent except for the little mishap when the waiter accidentally spilled water on me. Also, the tables are really close together, so I had to stand up and get out of my chair a few times to let the customers at the adjacent table get in and out....  It got very crowded, so try to make a reservation if you can!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the decor is nice, the food good, yet the service is soooo bad. It took literally 1hr20 mins from the time we ordered, to get our main dishes. Did we receive any apologies for this? None whatsoever. I do not think we were the only ones waiting as I saw people from other tables who got up and just left. The lady, who seemed to be the manager, was very unpleasant. She seemed to be in a terrible mood all night it was hard to get her attention as she ignored most of our attempts to communicate with her.   Aside from that, when we did get our food it was not bad. It was expensive and small portioned, but the flavors were tasty and unique. The decor was nice and clean, and if they didn't totally suck customer service wise, I might have come back. Simple smiles and basic customer service training for the servers would greatly improve a diner's experience here."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with vegan and non-vegan alternatives. Attention - they charge $6 to share food which I think is outrageously expensive. Other than this, their wine selection is okay, and their food just phenomenal. It's full of flavours and spices. If you like food from India and Tibet, you should try this place! For dessert they have little cakes, I tried 2 that were just okay; not sure if in the future I'll get any. You can eat with utensils or your hands - but trust me, once you get the hang of it, hands make the whole experience even more interesting! And yes, they give you a little hot towel to clean your hands before. Decor is chic - I might even say romantic...I would go again!"}
{"text":"Nil bleu was a good experience. Food is a bit pricy but worth the experience. Service was good and the wine list was reasonable. Very trendy little restaurant, nice decorations.   Food was good, we ordered a few dishes and we shared. Their hummus is amazing but very spicy. Ethiopian cuisine is spicy anyways..we will def be back!"}
{"text":"This place is just meh. They are really trying too hard in some trivial respects and then not hard enough when it comes to the important things ... like the food! The ambiance is nice; perhaps a bit overdone. The service is affable enough. But, alas, the food ... if they worried a little less about the decor and instead emphasised their focus more on the authenticity of their food then I'd be much more satisfied. I really could care less about ambiance. I don't go to a restaurant for the atmosphere. I don't go to a restaurant for the service or to complain to the waitstaff. That's just not how I roll. I go for the food! The delicious and life sustaining food. Notwithstanding the African and black and white zebra-print theme that this place has going on ... the food as I mentioned is anything but authentic. It's just uninspired.   Maybe it's just me but I must have ... I want ... I need to taste the heat and the spices of Ethiopia when I eat Ethiopian cuisine. This place is not that. I think that this resto purposefully caters to patrons who require a more bland and tasteless flavour profile. So if you want a watered down version of pseudo-Ethiopian food then this is probably your jam. However, if you want delicious and hearty and oh so fulfilling Ethiopian cuisine please do hightail it on over to East Africa Restaurant on Sherbrooke Street West in the heart of NDG and everything delicious will be yours to enjoy. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has negative reviews on yelp - I personally was very pleased. I had a living social deal for a three course prix fixe lunch and loved it.   Our waiter was amazing. He was playing host, and waiting on 11 tables and doing an excellent job. Why the owners wouldn't have had more staff for lunch on Saturday is sort of puzzling to me, but despite the lack of staff we were still waited on promptly and well taken care of. I left a big tip simply for the great job the guy did managing it all.   The food was pretty good. I had a curried beef with some sides. The food wasn't the best I've had, though I did enjoy it, the soup and tea were excellent though. The presentation was also unique, as you'll see from my picture.   The atmosphere was pleasant and very modern which was nice.  Overall - I'd say 3.5 stars, but I'll give it a four because I'm feeling generous."}
{"text":"Came here on the off-chance as the nearby resto we'd picked was closed. Glad it was, because this was a great discovery!  The decor is very loungey and made for groups and sharing, which I particularly liked. It made me want to come back with a whole group of friends.  The service was a little slow to start with, but very friendly, and we didn't hang around for our food. I had a sort of caviar of aubergines, which was very tasty, followed by the lamb in berberé sauce, which was mildly spicy and extremely tasty. The \"bread\" with which you eat your food is a type of pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe. For dessert, they offer an assortment of little cakes on sticks. I believe the one I tasted was chocolate with a lime and ginger filling.  Everything is served on a big plate in the centre of the table. I am not sure if they separate meat and vegan options. If you have a vegan friend, this is the perfect place to bring them, because half the menu is vegan.  As mentioned, pricing is very reasonable, and I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Situé non loin du métro Sherbrooke, facilement accessible en transports, le Nil Bleu est une institution en soi. Entrez et vous découvrirez un décor africain (tableaux, statues, plantes) sobre mais chic, de la musique traditionnelle et vous serez immédiatement accueillis par du personnel très poli et courtois. La carte offre un large éventail de menus (vegan aussi); je vous recommande vivement de tester les plateaux à partager, ce qui vous permettra de goûter du buf, de l'agneau, la purée de pois chiches, des légumes aux épices typiques, etc.. L'originalité de ce resto tient dans le concept \"manger avec les mains\", soit avec des petites crêpes (qui portent un nom spécial - tef ) qu'on peut redemander à volonté Possibilité de prendre des vins qui se marient bien avec les plats proposés Prix un peu élevés mais corrects pour la qualité, le service et le concept C'est souvent plein, je vous conseille de réserver Un must-do! :)"}
{"text":"Good restaurant and a nice sized sampler platter.   Not too authentic, but you are in Montreal so no complaints!  Cozy atmosphere and good service, prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Excelente opção para um jantar mais romântico! Ótima comida! Menu degustação é muito bom!!!  Tivemos uma ótima dica de vinho Sul - Africano do garçom e o atendimento foi ótimo!"}
{"text":"This was criminally bad service. I call to place an order, first the guy complains to me that \"they can't prepare things that aren't on the menu\" when I ask for a house salad. I had to prove to the guy that is was on the menu by convincing him to look for himself, why I waited. I said I would take whatever salad is on the menu, if their menu was different than the one online. He was very rude. I paid with my credit card over the phone. I gave all my info including the code on the back. My wife, who is visibly pregnant and has our 1yo daughter with her goes to pick it up, after waiting 40 minutes, she is starving, they refuse to give her the order because she didn't have the card on her. This is a totally normal thing, to authorize a charge without the actual card, restaurants always do this, but this asshole manager, who I could only assume is sexist, refuses to give her our dinner. They rather let it go to waste and lose regular customers. The guy apparently thought that we were trying to scam them. Did he honestly think that we would call the credit card company and pretend that this was an unauthorized purchase? And I mean, imagine if that was even the case, he is losing the money either way, but no, choose the option where he deprives a starving pregnant woman of her meal. Mind boggling. This is clearly a decision made out of hatred for women. Boycott this unless you want to support an obvious sexist."}
{"text":"Very nice, very good Ethiopian restaurant in the Plateau neighborhood.  We ordered the chef's tasting menu.  Started off with beef tartar which was very well spiced though I couldn't help shake off the whole Hannibal Lecter vibe.  Along with it is a mashed chickpea with puréed eggplant and sautéed veggies.  All very good.  They then brought us an array of six entrees.  Lentils, cabbage, spinach, chicken, lamb and beef and they were all delicious.  Only complaint is the injera bread isn't as tangy as I'm use to. It was spongy, but dull.  Topped off with coffee and a sweet honey wine.  Prices are a tad on the expensive side but the quality of the food, the atmosphere and top notch service compensate.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE.  Good food.  Great location.  Get reservations."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fish dish here, as well as some of the vegetarian dishes - Nil Bleu is absolutely hits the ball out of the park.   - Excellent, friendly and inviting service - Beautiful space with a welcoming vibe  - Generous portion sizes  - Something for everyone with a variety of meat, vegan and vegetarian options  - Most importantly - quality and taste of food hit the ball of the park"}
{"text":"I really did not enjoy my experience at Nil Bleu. I found the food to be bland and the sponge bread to be nauseating. Less I say about this place the better. Let us leave it at that."}
{"text":"The injera was paper thin with no flavor.  Veggie combo was utterly too salty, especially the potato & carrots.  Beef tibs were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Edible, but really mediocre food with non-existent service.  I might have been really badly spoiled in Seattle with really good Ethiopian food, but this place was just so disappointing."}
{"text":"Il y a peu de restaurant éthiopiens à Montréal et c'est définitivement une cuisine que l'on se doit d'essayer! Le plat principal est typiquement une variété de viandes et légumes en sauce servie sur une galette de teff (injera). On mange le plat en prenant des morceaux de l'injera avec nos mains et on s'en sert pour saisir les ingrédients en sauce. Une belle et bonne expérience.  Ici au Nil Bleu, l'injera est faite de millet au lieu de teff (je ne sais pas si c'est l'origine des proprio ou la disponibilité du teff qui est un problème) mais je préfère le goût et la texture du teff pour ce plat.  Les plats sont généralement bons mais un peu moins \"goûteux\" que ce que j'ai eu dans des restaurants éthiopiens ailleurs dans le monde.  Le service est correct, les prix sont un peu élevés mais compte tenu du peu de restaurant et de la localisation, ça vaut la peine d'essayer!"}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu which is probably the best bet here. The flavours were great and distinctly different. The chicken is amazingly flavourful however even as a major carnivore I must say the vegetarian dishes are the highlight of the meal. A great place for a date or a night out."}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant in Montreal. The food is spectacular. The flavors are rich and varied. The vegan taster platter is highly recommended. We held our rehearsal dinner there several years ago and we come back for our anniversary most years. The fruity cocktails are also fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"YES. The food was incredible. We had the vegan tasting menu and it was truly delicious. I loved all of the appetizers and the mains, but the eggplant appetizer and the greens in the main were especially amazing. The injera was fluffy and sour, the way it should be. I also tried one of the micro-brewed beers on the menu and it was great. The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 star review is that, given the ingredients used (lentils, split peas, veggies), it is quite pricey. $30 per person before tax/tip/drinks is a lot when every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to (and I've tried many!) has charged around $10-$15 while serving a similar amount of food. It's true that the quality at Nil Bleu is top notch, as was the service and ambiance, but it's hard to want to pay double what you would elsewhere for very similar food.  Edit: Forgot to mention that none of the dishes were spicy, which for some people might be important for Ethiopian food. I still thought they were all delicious, but the person I was with was disappointed."}
{"text":"We had been meaning to try this restaurant for a while, simply because it's the only restaurant we've heard of in Montreal where they don't give you utensils to eat! We went on a Saturday night for dinner, and were late due to lack of parking anywhere near the restaurant (only street parking available, and not much of it). The entrance to the restaurant was cramped, with a large coat rack in the way.  Decor was nice as well as the ambiance. There was a live pianist which was a nice touch. Since it was our first time, the waiter took the time to explain the concept of the menu and how we should go about eating our food. We ordered a hummus plate to start, which was delicious, but way too much hummus in comparison to \"Ingera\" (the spongy crepes used to pick up your food). I ordered the vegetarian platter, and my date got a spicy beef dish. The food came all together on a large platter with an accompanying garden salad and more ingera. Price-wise, the vegetarian platter was very reasonable ($17 for 4 dishes) whereas the beef dish alone was $14. The chickpea and lentil dishes were both good, but lacked in spice. The mixed veggies and the spinach were also a little bland, nothing special. Overall the dishes were alright, BUT after a while, I became nauseated at the texture of the ingera. It reminded me of a sponge and had a slight vinegar aftertaste which did not sit well with me. I would have probably enjoyed the food more had it been served with some other kind of starch. Good, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Bleu Nil last evening, never having been to a Nigerian restaurant. It was a wonderful treat. The place itself was lovely, very clean and inviting. The service was excellent. The food was out of this world. We had the tasters choice which involved selecting from a vegan menu and a meat menu. We selected vegan for appetizers and meat for main course, as I was concerned about eating a steak tartar which was in the appetizer selection.  The presentation was very inviting and all of the food was delicious. I was very happy with the tasters choice as it gave us an opportunity to try a cross section of selections. I was not disappointed and my husband was as happy as I with the restaurant and our selections.  For a cocktail, I ordered a cosmopolitan with the caveat that it not be too sweet. It was the best cosmopolitan ever. I really appreciated the bar tenders honoring my request, and I was rewarded with a delicious well balanced cocktail, not too sweet, not too tart, just right.  I heartily recommend this restaurant if you seek a spicy ethnic fare, in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"I first tried Ethiopian food at a conference in Rochester, NY. Already there, I was impressed, even though that restaurant was a little dingy inside. Imagine my surprise on seeing how nice Nil Bleu was inside and then how flavourful the food was! It's too bad they aren't BYOW anymore (they used to be), but it's a great experience with friends. The sour ethiopian bread they serve the food on and which you use as an eating utensil is wonderful!   What's great about this place, and their food, is that they have combo plates you can get for the table. This way, everyone can try a little bit of everything. Each different dish is wonderful, really complex flavour profiles, spices, marinades and a lot of stewed meats and lentils. The only downside is the DJ and the sometimes loud and obnoxious music. Other than that, this is a great bet for an interesting date night, or for dinner with friends. I agree with the other reviewers that you should try to sit outside if you can. Oh and make sure everyone WASHES THEIR HANDS before eating :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were originally planning on another restaurant but they closed at 9 so we had to find a backup pronto. Le Nil Bleu was just two blocks away from Sherbrooke Station, and we wanted to branch out to try different foods (we always go for Asian food as a go to lol ((we were almost persuaded by a Thai place))) this place persuaded us because it was so close and it was so cold. So glad we decided to go here, the food was delicious we got the table d'hôte with the hummus appetizer platter and I got the lamb my friend got scallops. All very delicious!!! We could not shut up about how good it was afterwards and how glad we were we branched out from our usual. Our waitress was friendly and left us alone to eat which was nice. We were seated immediately. The drinks looked good too. I will return. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Pleasant, wonderful ambiance with genuinely kind and welcoming service.  This Ethiopian set the bar very high for me and I have yet to find one that is as enjoyable.  The baticha (which is like hummus) is really phenomenal, and the veggie platter is enormous.  Definitely bring your appetite.  The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Lorsque vous pénétrez dans le Nil Bleu, vous découvrez une ambiance feutrée et un décor tout à fait de circonstance. Nous sommes en Éthiopie.  Avant de me rendre à ce restaurant sur la rue Saint-Denis, je dois avouer que j'avais quelques réserves car j'ai vécu 3 ans à Addis-Abeba et je connais donc les mets culinaires de ce magnifique pays. Et bien, je dois dire que j'ai été agréablement surprise par la qualité des produits, de l'Injera (crêpe acidulée faite avec du teff) en passant par le Doro Watt  (poulet en sauce avec ufs). Tous les plats étaient bien relevés avec entre autres la fameuse épice éthiopienne connue sous le nom de 'berbéré'. Bref, un vrai régal pour les papilles. D'ailleurs, j'y retourne bientôt...et vous???"}
{"text":"I came here for my first time today and it was everything I had expected! My mom had been wanting to go for awhile so a group of four of us went for Mother's Day lunch. We ordered the tasting menu which I would highly recommend. You get a selection of several different appetizers followed by a selection of different entrees.  The appetizers were all delicious, but their Steak Tartare was just amazing! The main meals were all very flavourful as well. I liked all of the meals, but my favourite entree was probably the dish with strips of filet mignon. The fact that you eat with your fingers and share a large plate make it a much more enjoyable experience.    They had a fun selection of fairly priced fruit cocktails - the one I got was vodka, coconut, peach, and pineapple - and a long wine list.  I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere. It was Sunday afternoon and not very busy, so it was nice and quiet. The restaurant had an African theme and was aesthetically pleasing.  I really appreciated the fact that the waiter explained to us what to expect and what was on the menu, as none of us had ever been there before."}
{"text":"Went on valentines day... Didnt opt for the 80 dollar chocolate fountain meal, didnt seem like a fair trade...so we were seated in a cold basement, packed in along with other diners...pretty much every customer was seated downstairs while upstairs was virtually vacant. Everyone seemed to find it pretty funny, even the wait staff. I get the sense that they dont respect the management or the restaurant itself, I can understand why....the food came out luke warm and frankly was underspiced, the worst ethiopian food ive ever had.  The music was god-awful, cheezy and weird. At some point a saxophone rendition of Star Light Star Bright came on.  The place is pretty cold, pretty weird, trying for a modern chic thing with pictures of Eithiopia and the desert on the wall, bit of a disconnect. While other Eithopian restaurants Ive been too have been relatively warm and inspired, Nil Bleu seems like a weird gaudy lab."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in the city.  My wife and I most recently went with another couple and we all split the tasting menu and a fish dish with chiles and a curry-based sauce.  It was the perfect amount of food for our party and left us all satisfied, but by no means over-stuffed."}
{"text":"Bon resto mais qui manque d'authenticité. Service impeccable et aliments frais . Prix raisonnables et vin maison en plusieurs formats"}
{"text":"Avis mitigé pour ce restaurant. Il y a des bières des dieux du ciel et ca c'est cool :) La carte est alléchante et regroupe plusieurs type de cuisine africaine. Nous avons pris le menu dégustation végétarien. J'ai aimé ce que j'ai mangé mais au final j'ai trouvé cela cher pour le prix. On part de légumes et de crêpes d'accompagnement. Faire payer 60$ pour 2 pour cela c'est trop à mon sens. Ok il y a une bonne portion mais la matière première n'est pas la plus cher. Au moins c'était bon et bien assaisonné."}
{"text":"Ended up here for a late lunch. So late that the waitress had gone off. Never mind, the hotel receptionist filled in, with excellent, attentive service. The meal took 30 minutes to arrive, it is not fast food. It tastes like well made, with love, yummy food with rich varied tastes and textures. I had the vegan sampler--so good, spinach, lentils, split peas and a cabbage/potato/carrots mix. Each with a different flavor profile. Husband had chicken with hard boiled egg and a nice salad. Well-seasoned and impossible for him to describe the flavors beyond--never had anything like that before, and excellent."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, the ambiance is really nice for dinner, and the staff is friendly. Im not an expert on East African cuisine, but I went once with a friend who's lived in a few places in Africa and she wasn't super impressed with the Ethiopian dishes particularly. She liked their 'other African dishes'. I like that they offer variety.  I dont think being in Montreal it will ever be the real deal, especially when servicing Western palates. Restaurants have to adapt to become profitable (dumbing down the flavors and such), but I still really enjoyed the dishes. I never left unsatisfied (except for my wallet). It's a bit pricey..."}
{"text":"Très bon repas.  Bon service... outre le fait qu'ils nous ont chargé un menu dégustation de trop et des boissons grand format au lieu des petits que nous avions commandés.  Le serveur avait l'air particulièrement pressé de nous retirer nos plateaux"}
{"text":"Sit outside if you can, it adds to the fun experience of eating with your hands! Actually, any good Ethiopian restaurant has you eating with your hands and that is what you should expect. The food was VERY decently priced and very delicious.   I highly recommend getting a combo and sharing it with someone. My friend and I did this and added a vegetable dish and we had plenty of food for two big eaters. The end price also didn't break the $40 mark, which, for Montreal seems to be very cheap.  It would have been nice to see Ethiopian wines on the menu, but its ok!  The service was great, the flavors were there and I would be more than happy to try it out again!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate Paul's graduation, and luckily for us, his dad was paying (we could never afford this ourselves). We had all had Ethiopian food before, so we knew what to expect; savoury curries eaten with spongy bread.  Paul ordered an \"Ethiopian Sunrise\" juice, a mix of four exotic nectars, and his dad got a house cocktail. Both were exactly what you'd expect, nothing extraordinary but certainly tasty. At the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the tasting platter for two, but increased for 3 people. We got the vegan appetizers and the vegan main course, but subbed the spinach for the fish dish to appease the meat eaters. The appetizers were quite good. In the middle there was a red cabbage leaf stuffed with a spicy eggplant mash and covered in a soft hummus. On one side was a sweet carrot stir fry, and on the other was a boring tomato salad. We polished this off quickly, and honestly I was already getting pretty full at this point. Our table was cleared, and (sadly) our spoons were taken away, leaving us no option but to use the injera to eat the main course. I like injera, but I didn't want to waste my precious stomach space on sour squishy bread. The main course was unispired. Two of the vegan options were the same, a red lentil stew, which was ok but really boring. Paul said it was his favourite, and still agrees it was boring. There was a split-pea stew as well, and honestly I felt the peas were undercooked, having that woody bean texture. The potato carrot thing was okay, well cooked and flavoured. There was a saucy mixed veg stir fry, which I thought was ok. The fish, according to the boys, tasted like absolutely nothing, and the sauce was bland enough to be overpowered by the injera. In the middle there was a completely out of place vinaigrette salad with lettuce, shredded carrots and cabbage, and pickled beets? It really felt awkward. We managed to eat 80% of the meal before the bread got the better of us. The waiter came around offering dessert, but we just couldn't fit it. The tasting platter comes with a mead, and it was pleasant, much sweeter and \"honey-er\" tasting than many I've had before.  Overall we were disappointed in the restaurant. The price was painfully high for the quantity and quality of the food (they are serving me lentils.... that shit costs 0.02$). Despite what other reviewers are saying, there was 0 spiceyness in any of the dishes we received, with the mild eggplant being the absolute hottest item. We've had Ethiopian before, and this really felt like the watered-down, unflavoured white version. If you're hoping this is a good way to get a taste of authentic Ethiopian food, you would be misled.  Also, the decor is hella tacky. (Zebra print chairs and wallpaper, painting of \"tribal\" women, a staircase waterfall?????)"}
{"text":"Le paradis en bouche... Toute une expérience culinaire (menu dégustation). C'est juste le meilleur pour un diner romantique. Le service etait parfait et la déco, la lumière et l'ambiance étaient en merveilleuse harmonie !"}
{"text":"My partner and I had an incredible experience here for a late-night dinner. The vegan tasting menu for two is incredible: nothing else ordered, nothing else needed. In addition, there was marvelous service: attentive, but not hovering.  We're visiting Montréal for only the two nights, and might go back again for dinner tonight, it was that good."}
{"text":"Let's start off with OMG OMG OMG... it was sooooooooooooo good! I bought a coupon off of groupon to try it out and was NOT disappointed. I was so pleased with the service and the staff and the food. The flavors were out of this world! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Si vous n'avez jamais goûté à la nourriture éthiopienne, je vous recommande de tester l'un des menus dégustation pour deux ($30 par personne). Il y a une option végétarienne et une option \"viande\" (dans laquelle il y a également des légumes). Le tout est composé de deux plats. On ne dirait pas comme ça, mais c'est plutôt copieux.  Tout est plein de saveurs (parfois un peu trop d'épices), mais c'est bon ! Le concept est également très sympathique et convivial : on prend un petit morceau de galette avec les doigts et on l'utilise pour attraper la nourriture, comme une cuillère. Lavez-vous donc bien les mains avant de manger !  A la fin de votre menu dégustation, on vous offrira également du Tejje, qui est une boisson alcoolisée à base de miel (on dirait un peu du muscat, en plus sucré). On vous proposera également des petits gâteaux en dessert (des genres de cheesecake (pas très éthiopien tout ça). C'est néanmoins en supplément du menu, $3,5 le gâteau.  Pour ce qui est du cadre, rien à redire, c'est très classe mais tout de même chaleureux. Bref, le Nil Bleu est l'endroit idéal pour tester une nouvelle expérience culinaire en toute convivialité !"}
{"text":"I really have mixed reviews about this restaurant.  The first time I went in was in May 2016.  I was all by myself.  A male server came out and just said \"Oui\".  He thought I must be someone who came asking for food or a job at the restaurant.  I said I would like a table for myself.  He just couldn't believe that I could be a customer.  OK, after convincing him, I sit down and get my food.  Agree, it was tasty and good but the service lacked big time.  I should have just walked away after being treated badly but I did want to show them that brown people can perfectly eat at a good restaurant and pay.  Ever since that incident, I have come here two more times and the last time, they just tested my patience.  I came in asking for Shuro Wat.  The lady suggested the vegetarian platter to me.  I asked if I could substitute one of their platter items for Shuro since that's what I came for.  The lady said yes and went in.  Ten minutes later, the platter comes out without the Shuro.  I politely tell her that they got the order wrong and that I asked for a Shuro substitution.  She took the plate back to the kitchen only to bring the same plate back 5 minutes later saying there is nothing they could do about it.  I believe Shuro cannot be ordered as part of the combo since it takes a while to cook.  I understand that because I make Shuro at home but this should have been communicated to me.  Now, they literally give me something that I never asked for in the first place.  I thought maybe I would get a discount on the bill.  No, nothing.  How shameful can it get?  When I complained about this to the manager (who only met me much later), she said oh well, just don't tip your server then!  This place has decent Ethiopian food which is lacking in Montreal.  If they were in California, they would be out of business by now with this kind of attitude.  The food is still decent and I appreciate that they have vegan dessert.  The service however sucks!"}
{"text":"Great decor ..great food ! Must try ..one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in Canada if not the best ..go for it without thinking you would not regret ! Oh yeah try the Gored Gored you would absolutely love it .."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.  It's romantic, has fabulous decor and friendly staff. The atmosphere was good not too loud or chaotic and we didn't feel pressured or rushed(somehow we spent two and a half hours here).    My love and I had never tried Ethiopian food and our waiter was very good at explaining everything to us. We decided on the tasting menu. Our food was out within 25 minutes and I honestly expected a longer wait based on the description of the menu items.  I was thrilled about the lack of utensils. Every single thing was tasty..everything. I especially enjoyed the lamb, so flavorful. The honey wine at the end was a special treat."}
{"text":"Cheers to this ethiopian restaurant! I discovered some new grub here and it was simply delicious and full of flavors. Highlight of this discovery was to eat with your hands.   I tried the tasting menu since it was the first time for me to eat ethiopian food. Lots of food. And good. First platter was filled up with vegetarian appetizer such salads, hummus, etc. Main course was mainly different meat such as lamb, chicken, filet mignon and some other salads.   Tasting menu include also a glass of hydromel and small desserts.  The waiter gave us good and pretty fast service. Sitting on the terrace was a plus."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit ! Très exotique ! Les plats sont savoureux et épicés ! Le menu dégustation est parfait pour les débutants comme moi ! Les prix sont abordables et le service est impeccable !

Une expérience très différente ét très goûteuse ! Je le recommande fortement !"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect walking into this place as it was my first time trying Ethiopian food.  The decor is modern with some African inspiration and there is also African music playing in the background.  We ordered a tasting platter (meat option) which gives you a chance to sample a bit of everything and is definitely worth it if it's your first time trying Ethiopian.  It's $30 a head but it does give you appetizers and a variety of main dishes to try so it is worth the money.    Traditionally Ethiopian food is eaten with your hands using a flat bread called ingera, which I might have spelled wrong.  If you would rather use utensils you can ask for them.  The bread doesn't taste like much but that's a good thing since you end up tasting the actual dishes more which are seasoned with a variety of spices.  My only real issue was that some of the options which were supposed to be spicy didn't live up to the hype but overall I really liked however I really liked how the food tasted.  The meat was very tender in all cases and the sauces that the food came in were very good."}
{"text":"We had the vegan platter for two (the smaller option, not the larger tasting menu)  Food was absolutely delicious, and service was excellent. Not a fan of the decor, but didn't matter as the food was worth it."}
{"text":"A group of 10 friends and I went To \" Le Nil bleu \" restaurant for my birthday Friday October 21st.    We arrived around 8pm after advising an hour late for our reservation and were disappinted that the reserved room was no longuer available for our group.  We appologised and offered to pay a fee, but The Lady  preferred to sit us at a corner booth instead .   With attitude she then asked us if anyone else was coming and added a Chair at the End of the table for the one person missing .   Whe then ordered drinks with the waitress whom by the look on her face felt more then akward of her bosses reaction .   We all ordered a Speciality house cocktail as well as 2 bottles of red wine . The wine was great ( 36$) The Co ktails were ... water , No Taste , a waste ...   We then ordered the main Course to Share @59.99$ for 2people Dégustation Menu . Which was very well explained by our waitress .   The warm cloths used to clean our hands  were sented of lavender .    The food I found to be very tasty quite spicy . I love the fact that we eat with our hands , all digging in the same big plate of food .   I loved the appetiser !!!   Being the fist time doing so I was affraid of getting food all over myself .  The little \"Crepes\" used to grab the food makes it safe . lol !   We then got served an honey cider ,I did not like it actually no one at our table did , again no taste.  We had for desert sample portions of cake @3.50$ each .  The best one was Pinneaple ! The others were ... bahh .   At some point one of my guests asked for an appetiser to the \"Frustrated Boss Lady \" and she rudelly said \" the kitchen will be closing soon . \" and walked away without looking twice our way.   No sorry ... No nothing ...   Our bill came up to 160$ for two people Drinks included and tip.   In resume , I had a good time with my friends and ate some Good Ethiopian food .  The drinks suck and wine is Ok .   Maybe , If we arrived on time we would have actually gotten taken better care of who knows ....  I still dont think its good for business , I will not go back and my friends neither .   Too bad our waitress was very cool ..."}
{"text":"Went to this place just for the vegan options. But did not know you ate with your hands. It was a great experience. They give you wet towels to clean your hands. We tried sharing course for 2. It comes with appetizer, main course and dessert (not vegan). Appetizer were delicious but felt that the main course was a let down on taste. The order should have been the other way around. The dessert is a honey wine, the menu contains a warning that it is not vegan. It may be pricey for some but the experience was great."}
{"text":"The food is full of flavor. One of the most delicious n flavorful food i had in the recent times. We ordered the platter for two which includes everything with the desert. The option of choosing vege and meat was a nice thought. The ambience is spectacular with dum lights and cozy feel. Perfect for a date I would say. You may feel a bit pricey but for the food and atmosphere you won't regret it for sure."}
{"text":"OK to start with, I have been to this place 3-4 times. The first time when I went with my boyfriend, I totally loved it. Romantic, food and service was totally awesome. I guess I should have stopped there. Just because I liked I took my friends 3 times, and the last time when we girls went, I totally regretted it. I will never go there again! The food was good! The service was the worst! The enjiras is supposed to be unlimited, however the lady who served us with very few customers in the restaurant failed to serve us more than once. We are not hungry starving people to eat 20 enjiras. But she didnt even serve a half of it to us. And the tone she replies to a customer is really not nice! AND TOP OF IT, she was FACEBOOKING the whole time! It was not that she was too busy to serve us.  I wanted to complain on this, so when I was leaving, I spoke to the person who was in the front, he said the lasy who served us was the manager! I WAS LIKE NO POINT TO EVEN COME HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"What can i say - was the first time eating ethiopian for both me and my partner.  We tried the samoling olatter and the food while somewhat indistinguishable to the eye, the flavours of each little blob of food on the giant pancake like injeera (sp).  Service was prompt, friendly, and took their time in explaining everything.  They have a goegeous interior, but any chance i get to sit in a patio I'll take it.  The only reason they lost a star was, well, I'm not cheap but i did find it a wee bit pricy but by all means not exorbitant just not a place to eat everyday this is a destination resteraunt and not a 3 day a week sorta pkace."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here our last night in Montréal.  The tasting menu for 2 is a great way to try everything,  and it's very reasonably price. Having been to Ethiopia,  the food was very authentic to what I remember.  They even served coffee very traditionally. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night, but we were still able to be seated without reservations after a 15 to 20 min wait. The wait staff was friendly and the decor had a neat African vibe."}
{"text":"Authentic Ethiopian cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere.  The decor is very charming, with African themed art on display throughout the restaurant.  The food was well plated and everything tasted delicious. The sampling dish for two, although a bit pricy, is a good choice as it allows you to try a variety of stews and injera as appetizers and main courses.  The service was quite slow and there was only one waitress, but that might have something to do with the fact that we were there late on a Tuesday evening.  Overall I enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely be back next time I'm craving Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Incredible quality Ethiopian food and the decor is by far one of the most beautiful of any type of restaurant I have dined it. Modern, clean, light, comfortable and friendly staff. Great vibe."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this restaurant after hearing nonstop hype from fellow vegans. I was honestly beyond impressed.   Firstly, the food was absolutely amazing. The use of spices was incredible, and all items on the vegetarian sampler dish for 1 (which were both vegan and gluten-free - score!) perfectly complimented each other. The meal came with quinoa as well, which was a nice addition. Prices are also very reasonable.   I will mention that I ordered from here for delivery and didn't dine in, so I cannot say much about the service. Although, the man who delivered the food was very polite. However, I am not sure if he's affiliated with the restaurant or JustEat.   If you have not yet to try this establishment's food, I highly recommend that you do so! Everything was awesome. I look forward to dining in very soon!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried Ethiopian food and I fell in love with it! This place is amazing with great ambience and awesome food. The service is beyond average. However, it is hard to find parking so plan ahead. We were lucky that we did not have to wait as we found that we should have made reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Toute première exploration pour moi. Le lieu dévoile un univers élégant et dépaysant: statues africaines en bois à taille humaine, tableaux de paysages africains illustrés, banquettes en cuir blanc, fauteuils et coussins en motif zébré, photophores en motif léopard, grand piano blanc,... Tout a été assemblé de manière soignée et harmonieuse. Avec mon conjoint, nous y sommes allés vendredi midi dernier pour fêter notre anniversaire de couple. Et il n'y avait que 2 tables : la nôtre, et celle de la famille d'un des managers. Autant dire que l'ambiance n'y était malheureusement pas. Moi qui voulais être tranquille, j'ai été servie. Nous n'osions même pas parler tellement le calme pesait, même avec la musique jazzy de fond. Petite précision, il y a bien du chauffage dans la salle, il a été effectif à la fin de notre repas.  Notre choix s'est porté sur le boeuf: - Zizil Tibbs: Tendres languettes de boeuf sautées au beurre avec des oignons et des épices; - Yesiga Alicha: Tendres morceaux de boeuf marinés, cuits avec des pommes de terre et des carottes, mijotés dans une sauce légèrement épicée à saveur de poivron vert (karia) et de gingembre frais (gingible). Outre le manque de générosité sur les pommes de terre, les plats ont été bien exécutés, avec une maîtrise des cuissons et des goûts. Autre précision, il y a bien des serviettes pour s'essuyer, la serveuse avait tout simplement omis de nous en remettre.  Un restaurant qui sait imposer sa personnalité et son originalité pour créer une expérience unique. Je souhaite renouveler, mais en soirée cette fois-ci, pour avoir la chance de m'imprégner de la véritable ambiance.

{"text":"My very first Ethiopian food experience is at Le Nil Bleu. I find their atmosphere cozy and comfortable, and their food is pretty good as well. The vegetarian sampler is especially good with lentils and fresh salads. In fact, I would prefer the vegetarian over their meat dishes. Their service was rather slow though."}

Ayant choisi l'Éthiopie, on a appris tout sur leurs habitudes alimentaires et avons visité le Nil Bleu pour se familiariser un peu plus avec leurs choix!   Similairement aux mets Indiens, un pain est servi pour accompagner les plats principalement en sauce.  Le pain est un injera, fait de la graine de teff et est ensuite fermentée pour créer les bulles charactéristiques sur l'injera. La fermentation permet de développer un goût acide et les bulles permettent de bien capturer et absorber toute la sauce :)  Je vous conseille grandement de choisir des combos pour pouvoir goûter à tout! Autant les végétariens que les carnivores seront contents par le choix! Le prix est très abordable considérant les portions. Et l'expérience inoubliable! Seul hic, les épices peuvent être trop intense pour certains. Il est arrivé souvent que mes accolytes sortent avec un maux de ventre mais bon... ils sont trop faibles ;)"}
