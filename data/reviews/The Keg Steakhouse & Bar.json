{"text":"There is nothing special about this place. Really very average steakhouse with average food and service.  There are much better places in the city to get a good steak."}
{"text":"I don't mean to single out this location its all of The Keg that has gone down hill.  My friend took me here recently service was ok food was not.  I had peppercorn NY the steak was ok the sauce sucked! How do you screw up peppercorn sauce?  Also prices are up seems like that company doesn't care about quality anymore.  The Keg of 10 years ago I miss you!"}
{"text":"Just had an awesome dinner at the new Keg on King St West last night. It was our first time there and we were met with great service and food. We were seated in the 'library' section which had a nice vibe for a dinner.   My filet mignon was perfectly cooked and flavour was on point. Service was good and the price is very reasonable for a steak dinner.  I'm looking forward to their patio in the summer season; will be back!"}
{"text":"Living downtown I feel a bit sinful for going to a chain. So many awesome independent restaurants. However if you want a steak, I think the Keg is a great bet.   This location is particularly fancy, newly built and powered with renewable energy!   For appetizers I love the tuna tartare, bacon wrapped scallops, and the classic shrimp cocktail. Nice way to start your meal - watch out for the bread though it's deadly, try to save room for the main event!   I always get the 8oz filet mignon with bernaise and either garlic mash or double stuffed potato. They always seem to get medium rare right and I appreciate that. The meat cuts like butter and a little richness from bernaise doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"I love the steak!! My husband's favorite steak house!! Great staff!! We love to bring guests here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and costumer service. The environment inside is very romantic. Reasonable prices. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Really like the location and service. Reminds me a bit of Houstons. The Prime Rib was fantastic and the prices were on par with what I'd expected."}
{"text":"Theres some moment in life that my tastebuds would never forget. Last night i got that delicious baked shrimp for apetizer and a lobster tail/ top sirloin for entree. Very very juicy and taste amazingly good. The service was great, the staff treat you like a king the ambiance is great. And when i have good food in front of me, im a happy woman. I just love it! Even if i wanted to find something bad to say i just cant find anything."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner for my birthday!!! Treated like a queen!! I had the pistachio crusted salmon-wonderful!  The garlic mashed potatoes were great too.  Service was a little slow and lack luster but the atmosphere in the bar area was perfect. I will  be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my super pregnant friend. Our server's wife was also pregnant and also had a child, he gave my friend great tips. I ordered a filet mignon with no bacon wrapped. I was too busy to notice, but our server noticed it right away and comped my meal. I ordered it medium rare and it was so delicious, I didn't have to chew.    It is a great place to have great food after shopping at Heartland or a get together. I would definitely go back to this location and avoid fighting for parking."}
{"text":"we had a very bad experience and top of that very bad server . bcuz when we order medium rare they brought well done than took it back again brought very rare . the manger should have give any coupon they even havent offer anything else they are very rude the y roune  our  romantic evening . this happen couple of times.   ceaser is the super place to have steak not here at all . beware with this keg .."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Attentive and on point. I love steak but I wish they had bigger steak. I am still hungry afterwards lol. The atmosphere is nice and casual."}
{"text":"I bought Prada, her baby and my Aladdin to dine at this place, and i was not happy. When appetizers arrived,  she didn't offer to ask for fresh peppers and I had to had to request for them. Escargos had a strong smell of curry to it,  Prada and i did not enjoy it. French onion soup is not as hot as I assume n it's did not have enough cheese. I have been to this location 5 years ago and the onion soup then was served with a lot of cheese. I ordered grilled prime rib as my entr√©es, and I have say that  Baton Rouge on Highway 7 n Leslie is the best so far. My food was cold or warm and not as hot as I prefer. Prada's salmon was too salty and was also warm and not hot. Going back to the appetizers, I had to find another server to check on our appetizer, as it was taking too long, noting that our server took long to check on us. I had to look for another server to order an extra entree. But my server double check my order so at least I know it's team work here. I purposely came here late around 11pm bc I was hoping it will not be busy and have better and quick service. Going back once more, When I first came in the host did not greet us, and I had to wait for her to finish cleaning the glass door to greet, i found that rude. If you do end up going here, I recommend new York steak."}
{"text":"At no fault of the server, this restaurant which claims to specialize in steak, failed to provide the requested meal and for that reason I will not go back. Maybe this is just a weekly meal out for some people, but for others it may be a very special night in which they have travelled a great distance to eat. The kitchen should specialize in Steak and how to prepare it. Very disappointed. #shouldhavestayedathome"}
{"text":"The food at this location was up to typical Keg standard (at least the locations I have been to). What really made the meal was the service. I was with an extremely large group of more than 20. We each had different meals and different drinks and stayed for several hours. Brendan and Michelle did an awesome job of looking after us! Not an easy thing to do for a group that large."}
{"text":"Amazing service. The salmon is simply out of this world. A must try... The salmon is probably better than Ruth's Chris steakhouse!"}
{"text":"I went hear with a group of 4 on a very busy weekday night. We were seated very quickly and the waitress came to our table right away. All the staff are very professional and friendly. Despite how busy it was, we all got our steaks very quickly and they were all done perfectly. The waitress was attentive and gave us great customer service.   The only thing I didn't like about the place is the seats are too small. We were seated at a booth, but we felt squished (we are all small people). Other than the seating, everything was top notch. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to the keg twice with my family , it's a great restaurant and the waiters are super nice . The meat is excellent , well cooked and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. The environment is very welcoming. Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Want to eat somwrhing healthy Salmon with asparagus and rice. The salmon  is a little too salty and the escargot.  Do not order unless you like curry. Has a strong curry taste"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest looking Kegs I've been to. Service was good. Appetizers (mushrooms, calamari) and dessert (creme brulee) were nothing special. The standouts were as always the steaks,  filet mignon and the mushroom/peppercorn steak. And I recommend the Mr Figgy over the Whiskey Jack cocktail (I think that was the name).   It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night and I'm sure it's packed on the weekends. Overall, it's a solid place, the lounge area is very cosy and not loud (good for a few friends or a date).   Hey, Tardis fans, it's bigger on the inside!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at a Keg restaurant. This was an experience worth repeating again and again.  I had the mushroom and onion Manhattan. It was perfectly cooked. We even had dessert to share. It is super busy so make sure you go early or prepared to relax in the lobby while you wait."}
{"text":"Food is consistently cooked to perfection, bartenders are well versed in their mixology and service is not only friendly but reliable.The only know that I can give the establishment is that the pricing could be a bit more affordable but you can argue that the overall experience is a justification."}
{"text":"The keg is always the back up go to place for steak, not the prime choice. I don't find their meet very tender, with the exception of my last experience when my husband go the filet mignon. I don't know why I never tried it before but its quite good! Twice baked potato, while not the healthiest choice, is very tasty. Oh and their ceasar is awesome. This particular location is pretty good. The staff are very pleasant and not annoyingly in your face. The service speed is good too."}
{"text":"After trying Copa Cobana, I'm no longer a big fan of the keg. The keg has become more of a \"let's get a drink and some appetizers\"  On various occasions I've had the steak come out well done when asked for medium rare. Sometimes the bacon wrapped steak was missing the bacon. The kitchen just seems too rushed and sloppy.  I'd rather spend $7 more ($33 versus $40) for an ulimited variety of perfectly cut steaks!  Can't give it less than 3 stars cause this restaurant was always my old faithful place to dine and I've had memorable experiences there."}
{"text":"Sept.2015, this is my second time at this Keg, I was here a year ago and enjoy the food and services very much, so we return this time and the food and services is very good, next to no one. I have to other Kegs and steak houses, but this one is by far the best in Calgary. My thanks to the management, RJ"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price for a steak house."}
{"text":"So damn GOOD!! Never disappoints. Servers on point, food consistently delicious, atmosphere romantic/cozy."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Kegs across the country and every time I leave satisfied. They know where to find the best beef and they know how to cook it. When I was at this location, an intoxicated man met me outside for a smoke and told me he had been there since 5 pm (it was now 11:30) and that he loved the place \"so much\" and that I probably never go there myself. But that's okay, he assured me, because he had a lot of money and well, he could eat steak and drink there all night if he wanted. Which he did and proceeded to throw up all over the entrance way. I didn't hold that against the place, though. Because the ribeye was one of the best I've ever had. The servers were all great and it was a magical night, all in all."}
{"text":"We were seated right away in this spacious keg location. Excellent meal, very accommodating to kids.  The server brought my son a complimentary plate of fruit, which was a nice touch!    Great service, Great food! We will definitely be returning..."}
{"text":"Being from out of town (out of country actually), I wasn't familiar with the Keg. I was expecting some sort of mediocre chain, i.e, Outback Steakhouse. Luckily, I was pleasently surprised!  I thought the decor and ambience were very upscale, and it was the perfect setting for a quick lunch. We had a couple of sandwiches, the Brie Chicken and the Beef, and both had French onion soup on the side. They hit the spot, and didn't take too long to come out. Service was prompt.   I'd like to come back and try a steak. I've heard they're quite good. They were offing a Cajun Shrimp and Steak lunch special that sounded delicious, but I felt it may be I bit heavy for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I would come to this Keg location every month until there was a long black hair wrapped around my grilled steak! It was grilled in to the steak! The manager was in total shock and speechless. I will NEVER return! Think twice before going! I can only imagine what goes on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"In a corporate restaurant you expect consistency in a food and beverage experience so it falls to the staff to make the difference.  Last night my spouse and a friend chose to meet me on the patio and arrived first - only to be greeted (or not greeted) by a fairly contemptible and surly staff (not one but three).  Granted both ladies are middle aged but both were also professionally dressed coming directly from work.  I arrived wearing cargo shorts and a shirt as I went home to change first - and yet was treated with more deference and attentiveness than they were.  Notwithstanding the fact that we probably dropped twice what neighbouring diners did per person, the initial reception coloured our evening.  Quite a surprise when you compare that to our many previous experiences at the bar and inside.  Shame."}
{"text":"Great service.  Friendly staff.  Food was perfect.  Timely fashion.  We celebrated a birthday and they went the extra mile.  Most restaurants will automatically add a tip for large groups.  The Keg doesn't.  When asked why they said we work based on merit and if we deserve it our customers will show it.  Amazing !! Thank you to Tom (Manager) for working with our group size and restrictions.   Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just came back from this restaurant and I really enjoyed it. The food was absolutely delicious and the waitress was very kind and attentive. Only minor downside was the food portion. My dad got the sirloin (8 oz) with a side of mashed potatoes, and he didn't feel quite full. I got the same thing, and felt satisfied...not completely full. My mom got the pistachio salmon and she also didn't feel completely full either. You'd definitely need to order an appetizer if you're going in famished. Other than that, the food was well done, and very delicious. I'd definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Keg steak house but this one by far got the longest waiting time, the only reason I go here with my family because obviously the food is great and its the closes Keg we can find. We going to try to avoid this one and go to a different Keg next time because at least we don't have to wait that long."}
{"text":"I'd normally rate this experience a 3.5-4 stars, at most, but the service here definitely bumped it up.   To start, we had some complimentary bread. It was kind of sourdoughy, which I don't like, but warm, fresh bread almost completely made up for it.   I got a 9 oz. Shiraz and my partner got the Zinfandel. Both perfect wines to eat with our red meat! I ordered the 6 oz. top sirloin with caesar salad, and my partner ordered the 12 oz. top sirloin with garlic mashed potatoes. My partner likes his steak medium, whereas I'm always a medium-rare kind of girl.   When my steak arrived, I immediately knew it wasn't cooked to medium-rare. It was a bit tough to cut through, too, so it didn't seem like the best piece of meat. Our server, from afar, saw us picking up our steaks and comparing their doneness, and came over at once. She was really great. Started asking if everything was ok, and I wasn't about to complain and ask for a new steak, but she was very, very nice about it. Said that it wasn't a big deal to get a new steak, and seemed genuinely to want me to be satisfied. She then called over her manager, who quickly assured me that it'd be no problem to get me a new steak. He took a look at mine and confirmed that it wasn't medium-rare.   About 4 minutes later, they got me a new plate of 6 oz. top sirloin, this time definitely cooked medium-rare (and much tastier!) and even more side veggies and another side caesar salad (after I'd already finished my first one).   They also brought me another 9 oz. of Shiraz on the house :) Can't beat that kind of service. Our server was the perfect amount of concerned, cause nobody likes servers that check up on you every 5 minutes either. Would definitely come back to this location!!"}
{"text":"When I was in town I used to love to come here and order the Bleu Cheese Filet. Always done right and tasted great. The filet is always wrapped in bacon and comes with big garlic cloves. Very tasty!  The restaurant had sort of an \"uppity\" wannabe feel to it...but all the service was still polite. Prices were a little high, but that kept with the uppity vibe I guess.  Oh yeah, I had some type of 3 part desert. That was awesome as well.  Only four stars for the uppity vibe and high prices. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Delicious medium rare steak... finally a place willing to cook a steak properly... rare.  In the US this is not always the rule.    Friendly place, big and not crowded at all for us at around 5:30 on a Thursday.. kind of early I know but it was an after work thing.    Good beer selection.  Service is fine but nothing special.  Prices are high though, def. more expensive than what I was expecting."}
{"text":"The group at the table next to ours was so loud. At times, we couldn't hear each other. For the food however, pure delight. The Steak and Lobster with the Baked Brie as an appetizer made a complete meal. For the drinks, a glass of French red wine is the best out of the choices offered. No more space for dessert unfortunately. However the cr√®me br√ªl√©e is a must! I tried it on a different occasion. Definitely would recommend for a date night!"}
{"text":"this place has excellent service.  managers are always helping.  food is awesome.  you already expect to pay more. value is the only concern."}
{"text":"We started with calamari appetizers which were done to the exact crispiness that we liked While I got the lobster and sirloin - my spouse had sirloin as well. Hers was done correct and tasted good My lobster was ok - not excellent or bad however my steak piece although wasted to the correct perfection level was real bad piece of meat. While I briefly mentioned it to the very nice and professional waiter he immediately brought it to one of the managers which showed up within seconds She was very professional, apologized and took care of the problem to the full extent.  While I personally was disappointed Withy dinner I will come back   The Manager and Service is in this case what will get me back"}
{"text":"After having terrible service in Kelowna at a local steakhouse, and a \"The Keg\" location in Kelowna, we stopped by the Keg off of 130th.   The service was fantastic - we had drinks within 3 minutes of walking in. Our server was prompt with drinks, taking orders, and the food came quickly.  Well done. This is how a restaurant experience should be."}
{"text":"I like the food at The Keg but my recent visit did not start off well.    We were a party of two, with a reservation for 630pm.  I arrived around 620pm, and was promptly seated.  Then I proceeded to wait for my friend.  Knowing she was coming from work, and with a post-holiday work load, I did not fret that she had not arrived by 630pm.  But by around 645pm, I received a text from my friend asking if everything was OK (I'm not known to be late).  I responded yes, and that I was waiting for her at the Keg, and she responded the SAME - that she was seated at the Keg waiting for ME!  We confirmed we were at the SAME The Keg, and I proceeded to look to see where she was seated.  When I saw her in the next section to mine (separated by the fireplace), I had already ordered wine, so I asked my server to escort her to my table.  Finally we were seated together by about 650pm.  I asked her if she gave my name at check-in and she confirmed yes...so we're unsure what happened.  We proceeded to order dinner and then gab to catch up!  The manager approached our table to apologize for the seating mix-up and offered us a complimentary drink or appie.  So we enjoyed some bacon-wrapped scallops on the house.  Other than this mix-up, the food at the Keg is as expected.  I had the prime rib meal, and my friend had the teriyaki sirloin.  We both enjoyed our meals, and both met the usual Keg standards.  We were too full to have dessert, although we LOVE their Billy Miner pie!  Oh well, there will be another visit in our future."}
{"text":"I had the filet and my dad had the garlic shrimp plate, with some calamari and garlic shrimp as appetizers. The food was delicious and the service was great. We were served by Bob, very polite and courteous. Wasn't busy so got seated right away. Will come again."}
{"text":"Known to be a consistently high quality chain, this location was terrible.  I went with a group of business colleagues last night(3/23/17) and it filled up fast.  They let us put a couple tables together in the bar which was great.  The servers, both pretty friendly younger ladies, were either very overworked or disinterested in our party((I suspect they were busy).  When we tried to get another server to help us, she was busy doing shots at the corner table.  All that being said, I paid $40 for a bone in steak that was really, really bad.  I'm not a huge steak guy, so it's a treat to have the occasional indulgence, but the steak was slightly overcooked but had a texture:consistency that made it incredibly tough.  I couldn't eat it after just a few bites.  When the waitress asked how everything was, we told her it didn't taste right and she smiled and said \"ok\"..lol in fairness it was very loud so we'll assume she didn't hear us.  If you're going for drinks, stop in but if you're hungry you've got many other choices."}
{"text":"The food as always was delicious and cooked perfectly. Why only 3 (3.5 actually) stars? Well, as always the drinks are expensive and the beer options are terrible. The food is expensive yet you get what you pay for, but $8 for a Coors Light, really? This location is beautiful like every location I've been in, except they have a weird policy in the bar area with it being tables are free to anyone when they become open, there's no list you can go on in the bar area. It can kind of become a free-for-all when a table opens, that's really not how it should be for a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"I have been a few times to this location. I find it somewhat hit and miss. The last time they really messed up the steaks. I was there with a friend and neither of us thought it was that well done.  The reason they get 3 stars instead of only 2 is the way the handled our comments to the poorly cooked steaks. The manager comped our bottle of wine and the desserts. Very classy.  If they get the steak right, then this place can be great."}
{"text":"So, after my previous review the GM sent me a GC because he wanted to win back our business. Well, it started off great. The server we had greeted us well and was very personable. We ordered some drinks - my husband got a double Belvedere on the rocks and I a glass of Pinto Grigio, she asked if I wanted a 6 or 9 Oz and I chose the 9 and was glad I did.  My hubby got the crab dinner (they have a Dungeoness crab special on right now) with a twice baked potato and a side of sour cream. I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Salmon with a twice baked potato and sour cream on the side.  We also got a side of mushrooms to share.   The service we had was great, until we ordered our food.  By the time our food was brought to the table, my glass was almost empty and our server hadn't asked if I needed/wanted a refill or something else.   This is why I'm glad I got the 9 Oz, it would have been empty - but maybe I would have been offered a refill if it was?  My husband had to ask for his side of sour cream because although I got mine his was missing. Halfway through my meal my glass was officially empty and the ice I got on the side was completely melted...at least I had something to drink...I guess. I finished my meal and my husband finished his before our server asked if I wanted a refill.    We were seated for about an hour and only had one round of drinks...I had an empty glass for half of my meal.  We aren't slow drinkers and good service equals being asked if I was a refill BEFORE my glass is almost empty.  It wasn't that busy, even with the Boston-Montreal game. And really, it was busier when we got good service than it was when we didn't really get any service.  We could see the service stand from our seat and I don't know about you but if a guest's glass is empty isn't that more important that whatever conversation you are having with your co-worker?  Or am I just being overly critical here?  It's too bad.  This is the closest Keg to our house and after the three poor experiences we have had in the bar we won't be back. The GC didn't win back our patronage.  A great alternative is the tucked away Canyon Creek on the other side of Vaughan Mills, the service and the food are much better there."}
{"text":"Michael where were you? Michael our waiter was there when we started, took our order, delivered 2 pots of hot water and 1 mug for tea.  It took him 15 minutes to bring another mug, by then the water was luke warm.  Salads came quick, not delivered by Michael but by others.  My son thought the garden salad was the same as the lettuce wedge, didn't like the mix of veggies or the salad dressing.  Michael, after flagging him down, took it back and took it off the bill (which surprised us because we didn't know it was an extra charge).  Food came within a reasonable time, it was hot and excellent.  But they must get a cheap deal on the peppers.   From that point on, Michael must have gone on break.  No refills on hot water, pop or coffee refills were offered, he didn't come by to check on our food.  We had a group of 8 and were not drinking so maybe he figured we weren't worth his time.  On a $225 bill we gave him $30, not good.  If he had spent some time fussing over this table, refilling waters & pop, his tip would have been much larger.  But every time we wanted him he was no where to be found. The Keg needs to give some extra training to their staff."}
{"text":"Came here for a special occasion, staff was very friendly. Yes, sometimes the service is hit or miss, but even when its a miss its not horrible. Food is great here. I'll def come back to this location"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighbourhood steak houses.  The quality is very consistent.  However, during our last visit, I noticed the size of the wedge salad shrunk quite considerably.  Delicious crab cakes; however, the sizes are uneven when we added to our entrees.  The service continuous to be friendly."}
{"text":"The only word I can think to describe this particular Keg, is \"typical\".   Actually, I would use that to describe any/all of the Keg locations I've been to... but my hubby loves a good steak dinner, so we found ourselves here on Monday while up in Vaughan for other reasons.  The food is fine - satisfying, but no wow factor in my opinion.  The steaks were both cooked to our liking, and the sides (garlic mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables were tasty).  We had to ask them to bring bread before the meal, which I thought was normally done without asking.  And while this loaf was warm as usual, it was not wrapped in a napkin, so it got cold fast.    Our waiter was courteous and friendly, and very good at what he does.... however, he almost always addressed my husband (\"sir, I'll be over to take your order in a moment\", \"how is everything sir?\", \"I'll be right back with the bill sir\"), and all the eye contact was directed towards my husband as well.  Even when we handed the waiter a credit card with MY name on it, he handed it to my husband for the pin number.  I mostly found this to be a funny and presumptuous, but it could really rub others the wrong way.    The restaurant felt clean - but one thing that bugged me was the booth that I was sitting on - it's a leatherette-type upholstery, but mine had a big rip in it with the foam showing through.  The look is nice, but if it looks and feels run-down, it loses points with me.  A fine meal, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant the steaks are always perfectly made, staff is always friendly and quick. Great appetizers also always get the escargo"}
{"text":"The wait was very long 90 mins. The food was fabulous. Manager came and apologized gave up a discount due to want he wait."}
{"text":"Wait was insane (45 minutes) but it was totally worth it. Despite how crazy busy it was this was hands down the best service I have received at a Calgary restaurant in as long as I can remember.  Little details matter and it was clear that from our server to the back kitchen that the staff here was on point. I have had meals at many kegs in many cities and overall they are generally solid and very good but this one stands out head and shoulders and could compete with more expensive and exclusive steak houses. Will definitely return here to see if they are consistent and can keep up the outstanding work."}
{"text":"Service was alright; a bit slow at times but our waitress was friendly. The calamari we ordered was a bit rubbery but the dipping sauces it came with were nice. I had the oven baked salmon on mashed potatoes instead of rice. The mashed potatoes were a bit salty for my liking. My meal was decent.  My friend ordered a sirloin steak and they enjoyed their meal. We both finished off our meals with a bite sized brownie desert which was delicious. We would go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service. There was a hair on my plate but the server sincerely apologized and the manager even came to apologize as well and gave dessert on the house. I would come back again !"}
{"text":"I went to this place after a year for valentines dinner and I was blown away with the quality of food. Superb steaks and appetizers plus the amazing Billy Miners ice cream cake nothing had anything like it before. I think the management or something is changed since my last visit. Much better now!"}
{"text":"I always go to this Keg restaurant. Service and staff are wonderful. Food is fantastic. The inside and outside of the restaurant is very nice, has a cozy ambiance. Only problem is the parking outside, wish there was more. It's a very busy and popular restaurant, parking is sometimes hard to find during dinner hours."}
{"text":"What a Keg?  The table given to four of us is full of food on the floor.  The inside space for the sofa is so close not for anyone with a belly.  We ask the server to exchange another table for us.  The food on the floor may be due to a big party earlier.  A few servers are quick to vacuum clean all the surrounding areas.  The red wine recommended is really good but we still stick to the one always order at Keg.  We order Prime Rib to the maximum of 16 oz.  It is tasty especially it comes with fresh Horseradish which provides the sharp sensation through the nose.  There isn't too much fat that comes with the Prime Rib.  The Sirloin's texture is soft, tender, juicy, succulent - one of the best medium rare.  Not to mention how good it is when comes the Rib Steak.  I like the Twice Baked Potato which contains bacons bits except that it is slightly salty.    We have the same experience as other Yelpers that we have to ask them to bring bread before the meal, which we thought should be normally done without asking.     The server is very helpful and professional, always around and ask if our meal is ok.  At the end, he makes a very special thanks to us."}
{"text":"So it took us awhile to finally make our way downstairs to check this place out. We waited until the restaurant worked out all their opening quirks. Well glad we waited. As soon as we entered I loved the warm welcome from the hostess. The decor was also warm and inviting. There wasn't a table available so we decided to snack at the bar. Our appetizers which consisted of nachos and the baked Brie were pretty good. I especially liked the guacamole dip. The ladies serving drinks were friendly and they did an excellent job with our drinks and filling up our water glasses. I can't say enough wonderful things about the customer service. Before we left the manager came over and introduced herself to us and asked about the service we received. With service like this how can we not return."}
{"text":"Were there two times during our stay in Toronto. It is a huge, but very cosy place. They have a great selection of steaks. We tried Peppercorn New York and Blue Cheese Filet. They both tasted great. We tried their mushrooms and scallops&bacon as starters. Both dishes were very tasty. Also their Steakhouse salad is very-very good. They have a great selection of wine as well. The atmosphere is very warm and relaxing. The service was awesome. It's quite busy in the evenings, so it might be difficult to get place outside. They actually have more locations in other parts of Canada. I highly recommend to visit this place."}
{"text":"After some hiccups during the first week of opening, I've visited a few times since the terrible first attempt of dining at this location where everything went wrong from the beginning to the end of the meal.    Thankfully, management was apologetic and quick to resolve the situation by replacing the food orders and comping a portion of the meal and bottle of wine which we thought was generous. Knowing that we were regulars at the other locations may be a factor, but I do believe that was their great customer service in action.  Since the mishap, The Keg remains consistent with the service and quality of food being served and I'm a happy diner again and quite pleased with the new location which is nice and clean.  This location follows the design of the modern style and dark decor which the Keg has become to be known for and I have been accustomed to.  On a recent visit, service was friendly and welcoming like how I remembered The Keg to be.  Our server was attentive, mindful and always available before we felt the need to flag her over and she was also discreet as to not interrupt our conversation.  Prices have increased a little, but menu items were still very reasonably priced and one cannot go wrong with the standard Keg Classic dinners that included a generous portion of salad, choice of steak, potatoes (mashed, baked or fried) and grilled vegetables. Depending on the cut of meat, the prices varied, but all very reasonably priced. And who doesn't like their free warm bread to start?    Everything was absolutely delicious and when I have a steak craving, The Keg is usually the first choice and my go-to place for a good steak done right without causing too much damage to my wallet. Plus I just love the Billy Miner Pie (mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds).  I will have to try dining on the patio the next time because of the location right on King Street, this will surely be a good place for some people watching."}
{"text":"We just left this keg location and it was fantastic . We had a night out with no baby and had a gift card since last November.  We had the baked bree it was Sooooo good then we each had steak with mashed potatoes  . All of the food was amazing. And the white sangria was also very good. Our server was Sarah and she was so friendly and tentative to our table . 5 out of 5 :)"}
{"text":"By far the best Keg's I have been to (been to a dozen different). The staff is unbelievable and well make you feel special. Just had another great dinner tonight and we had the chance to have Victoria serving us and she is outstanding. Top notch restaurant and the manager is on top of everything it is easy to see. Always a great time when we go at The Keg Heartland."}
{"text":"I had a great dining experience at this location. The  calamari is a good selection prepared crispy and very tasty and not limply and oily. The salmon and the steak are excellent and desert was amazing. The service was also very satisfactory. I would certainly dine here again."}
{"text":"I eat here lots. always ordering the \"filet mignon steak with garlic mash potatoes\" hands down the best steaks around this is why I order it everytime!.  great service. great location. great pricing considering its a filet mignon. my drink is always topped up I never have to hear that annoying last sip of a drink out of a straw. friendly environment. ALL AROUND GREAT PLACE TO EAT!. 5 stars!! *****"}
{"text":"The Keg King West  This is not your average Keg.  Upscale and a good time had by all   I've eaten at the Keg all over Canada, and this is the One. I do mean THE ONE. The menu is the same the service seems to be more high end Supper club than your traditional Keg.   This King west like location has some of the most beautiful people to ever serve you food. I always sit at the bar to watch the crowd and the bartenders at work. The Bar staff at this Keg work hard and seem to make perfect drinks with style and grace.   Crystal my server was a new Keg employee. When the Keg opens a new restaurant they generally take people from all the other Kegs to complete their staff. I watch this server make drinks and serve me to Keg perfection.  Kudos on her Kudos on the staff around her.   Now to the meal. I ordered the 10oz filet as always. Today was medium.  Let's start with the salad. I've been to Kegs where the salad smelt like the fridge. Not this Keg fresh Fresh is the word.   Now the Steak. Perfection is the word. There's something different about this Keg. This Keg is a Keg by name only in my eyes. Hands Down Best Keg I've ever had a meal at. Jacobs is just around the corner and the Keg is just as good or better. Not as stuffy. This is the Best Keg Staff around. You deserve this title you earned it. Sorry Keg Mansion. This is a must eat experience to be had.    Side note. This must be told. Crystal while bar tending broke a glass near the ice. She did the right thing and changed the ice right away. Believe it or not I've seen other places Not change the ice.   So to the Keg you've out done yourself with this location. best Food Best Staff Best Design in this writers opinion. My other favorite Keg in Ontario is Waterdown Ontario."}
{"text":"I have been a Keg customer for years now. Over time like any place you develop expectations around what should be be delivered on your visit.   To start the food, atmosphere, and friendlies of the staff was completely adequate. Had a filet mignon that was fantastic and completely made my night.  That being said and the main reason for only rating this location a 3 star rating was as a result of the speed of our service. Every interaction with staff was left with a long wait before results.  Our until drink order came out in 2 parts and took over 10 min.  Any additional order throughout the evening wad met with long delays and often required a follow up request.   At the price point you pay for the Keg I expect the service quality to match the product. It unfortunately it wad quite subpar. Frustrations were witnessed on the faces of every member of my party.    Very unfortunate for such a respected establishment."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for lunch .. the menu is limited but the service is really good. I like the ambience and the cozy booths."}
{"text":"Went there this evening with my wife for our 28th wedding anniversary.  Dinner was superb and the portions were large.  We each had steak, and it was cooked exactly the way we asked.  My wife commented that it was one of the best steaks she has ever had.  My steak (the Baseball cut) was outstanding as well.  Our server was very professional and attentive.  After the meal, she and manager came to the table, wished us a Happy Anniversary, and gave us a nice card and dessert.  We felt that the cost was quite reasonable considering the quality of food, service, and classy surroundings.  The next time we are in Toronto, we will definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Although The Keg used to be a family go-to, I find that the quality of their food has slightly diminished while the prices have climbed quite high for what the meal is.  The service I have received from The Keg has always been very good, professional, and friendly. It is still a nice place to go for a nice family meal or to celebrate with friends, but I feel that for the price range, there is better food to be had if you find somewhere near the city.  As always though, the bread you receive as an appetizer is amazing, and I continue to dream about it every night.  3 stars for great service, friendly staff, and decent food, but the food is lacking for the price."}
{"text":"Being new to Toronto I had no idea I would be putting on 15 lbs. my first couple days here. The food in this city is outstanding and the keg is easily one of the best meals I've had in my life.   We went on Christmas Eve (yes! It was open!! And packed) and were seated immediately and waited on by the cutest girl ever. The only thing I don't get is they apparently have their employees speak with accents...we noticed everyone had an accent which we could rarely identify and often our sever dropped hers completely. It's was bazaar but entertaining. The food though...the food...  We started with a cheese appetizer which consisted of baked Brie, perfectly crisped bread slices, and a jalape√±o jelly that I can't stop thinking about. Absolute perfection. I loved my chicken and my love absolutely devoured his blue cheese crusted filet and lobster tail. For dessert (and we NEVER order dessert but this meal was just too good) we had the cheesecake and wow. Just a perfect meal.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for the past 2 years. Lately the steak has no flavor.  The customer service isnt that good. I rather go to the leslie location"}
{"text":"If I could afford to eat at the Keg, I would. It is always the first place I want to take clients and friends visiting Canada. The food is nothing short of amazing and is so flavorful and rich. My favorite is the Chicken Oscar which tastes amazing. The atmosphere is very fancy so it is a great date setting. Although it is pricey, it is with every hard-earned penny."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. Always fresh.  Wait staff are awesome as well. Zero complaints. The food as always left us all very full. The desert had to be brought back to the hotel tho lol. No more room. Didn't have a reservation but the wait time was very fast."}
{"text":"Amazing service here the food is amazing and they are always making sure you are topped up on drinks and bread. They will bring you anything you need and are super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu if you have any questions about what dish to have."}
{"text":"Went here for a company Christmas lunch on a Friday. Our servers were amazing and helped us whenever we needed him. He also helped us get things that weren't on the menu. I got the 24 ounce Prime Rib steak with the Garlic Mashed potatoes and it was truly amazing. The meat melted in my mouth and it was cooked to perfection. I didn't think I could finish it but after 20 minutes my whole plate was meatless. I however did not finish the onion crisps since they were very salty.   I would definitely have my team come back here again, it was a great experience. The only draw back was that there were a few other groups of over 10 people that were there with us and the seating area we had was pretty tight. Hopefully they can keep it up and kudos to the kitchen staff and chef for the amazing prime rib!"}
{"text":"I ordered everything on the appetizer menu and nothing was disappointing. I have to say the shrimp was the best (cooked not cocktail) most of the dishes come in escargot dishes and it's all amazing. The shrimp cocktail is traditional but the rest of them are all very flavorful and a little different but I suggest to try them all!"}
{"text":"You know you can't go wrong the the Keg. We got a table at the lounge and enjoyed some food and beverages."}
{"text":"Good thing there is another one in Brampton now. This place was busy to the point of ridiculous most nights. The food is good. It's the same as every other Keg, so if you like a pretty generic but decent steak, there you go.  They have messed up my food quite a few times in the past, and then they usually just bring your food back to the kitchen and get it re-done. Meanwhile, whoever you are with is almost done by the time your food comes back. They should offer to keep your date/companions food warm for you while they re-do it.   They will do this for you if you ask them."}
{"text":"Mmmm steak... And sometimes lobster or baked Brie! There hours are great, we're always going here for a late night meal and drink. The wine list is so so but I'd definitely recommend the peninsula ridge, maybe our wedding wine!  The lounge is solid and roomy and the service is always at least ok, verging on average.   For a late burger and fries craving, you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Get BRENDAN M. as your server.  He is probably the nicest, most genuine, honest, caring server you will meet!!! (he's easy on the eyes too!:) He literally made sure our child was happy the entire meal, offered us complimentary dessert for our congratulatory dinner, and was overall AWESOME.  Food was good too... try the cauliflower steak!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak! We took the Pecan with goat cheese, so yummy!  The ESCARGOT starter was great too!  Would love to come back again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite Keg to go to- great scene and atmosphere. Staff is always friendly and I've currently had a fantastic experience with the management, as well.   As for the food -- it's the Keg. You know what you're getting and it's always great. I highly suggest the escargot as an appetizer though.. Favourite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Good steak, nothing fantastic however. Go to Vintage Chophouse if in Calgary.  Good atmosphere for relaxing."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. This is my jam.  A five-star review doesn't have to be reserved just for uber-elite experiences. A restaurant that knows what its good at and capitalizes on those elements incredibly well (regardless of whether it's a hole in the wall or fine dining) is worth its weight in gold.  My friends and I made the trek here after an underwhelming experience down the road at The Rec Room and were blown away by the quality of the experience. We didn't even originally plan to eat, but ended up making it into a pre-Christmas dinner get-together.  The service was stellar across the board. I was expecting to have to wait for a long time to be seated, but we were quickly whisked into what was essentially a private section (we had a whole room to ourselves) and the staff were constantly on-hand to make sure we had refills and any extra needs. Our server (I forgot his name) was on the ball, even to the point that he brought out warm water for two members of our group who had the flu.  Almost everyone in my group decided to go for the classic deal. Three of my friends ordered the escargot, which came with some really nice bread (Hawaiian buns? Sourdough?), and we all had the requisite loaves of bread-and-butter.  I settled on the teriyaki sirloin, which came cooked to perfection. Interestingly, our server explained a bit about each cut of meat, which ones were most popular and which rarity was the most requested, which I haven't really seen at other steakhouses.  I also ended up settling for dessert. PROTIP: If you're going to order, get the two mini dishes (chocolate brownie/creme brulee). The best of both worlds, for a dollar less than the full version of either of them. The latter dessert came out perfect, with that delicious caramelized sugar coating on top.  I ended up paying about $50 for my meal, which also factored in the drink. It was a fantastic experience from top to bottom, and I'm glad we sought out the place. This might just be our new pre-Christmas hangout.  Well worth a visit. So far, Keg's two locations are two-for-two - they haven't let me down yet."}
{"text":"We arrived early we thought for an Saturday. Apx 5:30.  Was told 90 min to 2 hr wait.  We stayed & strolled into the busy bar. Ordered drinks and scooped up a table in the bar.  Music was very loud & boppy'.  Not really classy. I guess they are trying to attract younger folk. Even though it was filled with late middle age.  Service was great. Steaks were awesome.  Sad they no longer have peppercorn sauce.  Now it's just pepper\"corns\".  Dinner was amazing. Cooked perfectly. Prices were as expected.  Only thing we would change is the music.  The type & the volume."}
{"text":"Our visit to The Keg Steakhouse was more for my companions benefits than mine.  A steakhouse isn't really the ideal place for a vegetarian to eat, but both dishes I ordered were delicious!   Our server was very pleasant and polite and the general atmosphere was nice, no complaints there.     I had a Keg-sized Ceasar to start off (I LOVE the spicy bean garnish - yumm!).  I ordered a Baked Brie appetizer - so creamy - accompanied by a tangy Red Pepper Jelly and a powerful Pesto spread with mini crustinis.   I unwillingly shared a taste of this appetizer, and I think everyone liked it as much as I did.    I went on the lighter side for my main entree and had a Spinach Salad.  Topped with Cranberries, Candied Pecans, Strawberries, and Goat Cheese in a champagne vinagrette,  so crisp and refreshing.    I was looking forward to a Double Baked Potato (without bacon) but unfortunately found out that all the ingredients were pre-mixed and there is no vegetarian version of that side dish. A shame really!!  So I opted for a baked potato with some kind of garlic-cheese-butter concoction....it didn't disappoint.    But regardless of how good my \"regular\" baked potato was....my only piece of advise to The Keg is a vegetarian option of the Double Baked Potato.....pretty please!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"To start, I usually don't do chains unless I'm having a Big Mac craving.   Many on here are always wishing they liked a certain place for whatever reason.  I came in here thinking the opposite, who wants to admit The Keg is one of the better steak places in the city especially one located on King West. Unfortunately though, great streak, great service with a pretty good atmosphere.  Would I go back?  Nope, I hate King West."}
{"text":"superb service! The staff really made sure we were well looked-after. We walked in at prime hour 7pm on Thursday night, the wait time was reasonable.  The hostess was friendly and took us to the upper lounge area, made sure we had proper seating for drinks while we waited. I ordered the New Yorker, and it was cooked to perfection. Service manager came a few times to check if we were having a good time. I've lived in the city for over 20 years, and this was one of the best dinning experience I have  had.  Hellen"}
{"text":"Of all the Keg locations I've tried, I rate this one to have significantly lower standards for their food.  I've been here probably 4 to 5 times. The first few times was fine, nothing noticeable.   The second last time we visited, ordered a trio of dessert and it was inedible. There was a creme brulee that was curdled as if they had microwaved it. There was some sort of cake that was also really gross. When I complained they seemed well aware of the situation and that there were problems with the dessert - but then why continue to serve it?  The last time really did it for me. I ordered a filet mignon and shared it with my boyfriend. Now considering the fact that the steak was cut in half already when presented, how did they not notice right off the bat that it was improperly cooked? I ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty much blue rare. The lobster was also ridiculously overcooked, chewy and tough. They take the steak back and re-grill it, and when it is returned the 2nd time it was overcooked and shriveled to a crisp on the outside.  I complained via their website, and the restaurant manager kindly provided a gift card to make up for the experience. Suffice to say I won't be using my gift card at this location.  Even though they tried to rectify the situation, I still don't think this location's food is as good as the other Kegs. I'd recommend trying one of their downtown locations -- Front St and Mansion were both amazing."}
{"text":"Popular place. The meat is generally good, but they have a tendency to over salt steaks as part of their preparation process. You can ask for an unsalted steak but they usually only have a few are any given time. That's too bad because the quality of the meat is good enough so that you don't really need to turn it into \"death by salt\" ."}
{"text":"Came here for my fianc√©es birthday with his family. On a Thursday night. One member is in a wheelchair so they were very accommodating, making sure it was easy access to the table and close enough to the washroom if we needed it.   Our server was Meaghan, she was great!  Of course, we all ordered one kind of steak or another! Why wouldn't you at a steak restaurant?! Our server was very helpful and very friendly! She knew the menu very well, made recommendations on food and wine and very patient with us! We took quite a while looking at the menu making sure everyone knew what they wanted!   The only negative thing I could say is that my fianc√©e ordered the New York steak and it wasn't cooked to his liking. He ordered medium rare but came out medium. He was quite disappointed and our server did offer to make a new one but he just kept it and tried to enjoy it anyway.   Everything else was cooked perfectly    Since it was his birthday, the dessert was on the house. We ordered another cake and our server was kind of enough to us that one for free too."}
{"text":"Top sirloin steak was perfect, and the interior was cozy enough. The server Anthony made me feel comfortable with the kind explanations on foods on the menu. If someone is looking for everything-perfect steak house in town, I'd like recommend this place. :-)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Get the filet mignon with bleu cheese, a side of garlic mash and veggies...you will not be disappointed.           My only issue with this location has been on three occasions, they've run out of creme br√ªl√©e. It's not often I eat dessert after a larger meal at a restaurant, but the Kegs br√ªl√©e is unbelievable. It's obviously a popular item!"}
{"text":"A safe choice.  I tend to have a bias against big chain restaurants, I realize it's a bit stupid, but that's just the way it is. Despite that, I love the keg, and this location is no exception.  We actually had planned to go to Moxies, called to make reservations Saturday afternoon and they were full for the evening (we were a group of 8). Milestones was also full so we headed, with no reservations,  to The Keg.   After not too long a wait there were seats in the bar available to us to have a drink while we waited for our table. They brought us free bruschetta to munch on while we waited (nice touch).   The restaurant itself is very large with very high ceilings but everywhere has those high benches so it feels smaller than it is (that's a positive).  I've never had a steak at the Keg I didn't like, nor a steak that wasn't cooked exactly the way I ordered it. They are honestly always full of flavour and succulent as can be. The creamy garlic mashed potatoes are my favourite side, though the twice baked potatoes are pretty tasty too.  To me, compared to other \"Kegs\" this location is standard...but compared to other steak houses a 4 because everything is always delicious and the service is consistently great."}
{"text":"Checked this location out today. The parking lot fits more than the one on Macleod. The restaurant is beautiful and well taken care of. Our server Ashley was amazing and so sweet!  The food was outstanding. I highly suggest the teriyaki steak!"}
{"text":"Had the most memorable service while dining at The Keg Steakhouse (Keg #554) on December 28, 2014. I accidentally knocked over my full glass of wine, launching it on to my brother-in-law's dress shirt. Several waiters immediately cleaned up the mess. Nico jokingly asked our waitress if the restaurant sold t-shirts. She said she'd see what she could do. The manager came over with a brand new dress shirt, still in the packaging, that the waitstaff use. He took Nico's shirt, had it washed and dried with the on site machines and presented a perfectly clean shirt by the end of our meal. Amazing! Plus we had an outstanding meal! We all ordered steak they were cooked to perfection and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"The Keg might not have that \"boutique\" feel, but that's not why we eat there! I can't say enough good things about this location. They are so customer service focused and I had the most delightful time.  My girlfriend and I went there last night for dinner to celebrate me getting a new job. The ambience was great, servers were on the ball and the food/drinks were delicious! Climax of the night? They surprised me with a piece of cake and a candle and a card congratulating me! My server Tricia had told them why we were there and they brought me CAKE! It was so yummy.  It doesn't end there....in my excitement from getting free cake I accidentally whacked my glass of port off the table while telling a story to my friend. Spilled all over the floor. Drama? Nope! They were all smiles and Madison brought me a new glass.  I will definitely be going back there. Especially because of Tricia and Madison."}
{"text":"We always go here AMAZING service and food. We always get the salads, beer for him and fruity cocktails for me followed by steaks. Servers are extremely attentive, super friendly and just great overall. Ive never had to wait long for my food.  My partner ordered the New York steak that was juicy and tender while I got 12oz Top Serloin that was full of flavor. Both were mouth watering good medium rare !   Whats up with bad reviews on steak, maybe people dont know how to order steaks properly. I see this a lot  lack of knowledge for rare, medium and well done and all in between."}
{"text":"Went to The Keg last night for dinner.  We decided to sit in the bar area to eat as there was a 40 - 60 minute wait for the dining room.  We found a table but was really dirty.  I assumed maybe a family with a child were seated there before...?  The server came to clear the table and then clean it.  She sprayed the table then wiped the crumbs and remnants on the surrounding chairs that we were waiting to sit at!  The server was just about to leave when I pointed out that the chairs had some crumbs.  She cleaned them but we noticed the table wasn't really clean.  We sat at a smaller table just beside the unclean table.  The server also only brought two coasters for four people, then said she was going to get some more.  They never came.   I ordered the Thai Chicken and it was delicious but because of the lack of cleanliness, I'm seriously questioning if I will return to this specific location."}
{"text":"Great food and our server was awesome. This was the first visit- we loved it. Steak was great and prime rib very good."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience, here with our two large family's. There was no parking but that's forgivable because the food and service was amazing."}
{"text":"Double D servers at 3pm. Our subpar waitress  appeared to be an expired porn star. Lobster mac and cheese sucked.  Spinach salad was excellent. Keg Steak was fantastic!!! Spiked chi tea -- no review because I never received it.  Overall don't go to keg between lunch and dinner because the d team is working and only the bar area seating is open."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great management and amazing food! Love to sit on the patio in the summer. The interior is also very beautiful.  I've been hear several times and everything is always perfect. One time they made a minor mistake and the manager did more than enough to compensate for the mix up."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional however, service was NOT. First off, I made a reservation for two people for 5:15. The reservation was made through open table, where they ask what is the occasion and any special requests. The occasion was for my birthday and we requested a nice, romantic table. Prior to going for dinner, we went and saw the Illusionists which ended up finishing later than expected and making us 15 minutes late for our reservation. However, I did call and spoke with a hostess to let her know about our dilemma and if that would be alright. She said yes, but she didn't ask for my name or anything. We show up and I tell a host we have reservations for 5:15 and he grabs menus. He lets the hostess at the front desk know we have arrived however, she doesn't do anything, she just tells him to bring us to the bar side. I request to speak with a manager who was very kind and accommodating. She then moved us back to the dining side of the restaurant and told us that the hostess's behaviour was unacceptable. We sit close to the front door which is quite chilly when it is -15 outside. The other disappointment to this night was that nothing was done for my birthday. They didn't even bother to read or ask why we were there. They didn't bring out the special cake and we ended up ordering it ourselves and PAID for it. This location for the Keg is disappointing. I recommend going to other locations if you want to be treated and served well."}
{"text":"While I did not love the bleu cheese dressing on my wedge, I was impressed with the filet and the roasted mixed veg.  The salad dressing was sweet. Yes a sweet bleu cheese dressing and too much bacon and diced tomatoes covered the wedge. An unsophisticated preparation which is incongruous with the finely prepared filet. Of course, this is a chain restaurant, but they serve some fine cuts of meat and I just wish the salad was a bit more artfully executed with subtle savory flavors."}
{"text":"The keg is always a solid location but the service, timing and food was quite exceptional when I took my parents and in laws for dinner for the first time. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The waitress also brought us a free Ice cream cake slice as a congrats for recently getting engaged. All of our steaks were cooked to order and the food came out very sharply for a table of six. Great experience."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, the food portion was small, meal prices are expensive but the food was pretty good. I loved their Asiago rice more than the steak and calamari. However, the next time I have a steak craving, I would go to the Cheesecake Factory instead because of better quantity, quality of food and better pricing."}
{"text":"In my skinny prime snowboarding days of the mid-2000s, I first recall visiting a Keg Steakhouse in Vancouver.  But back then, I didn't realize this place was a franchise until now.  With it being a fine establishment and with recollections running through my mind, our waiter mentioned The Keg had all started in VanCity.  OHHH SNAP!  I remember now, I just started my career and most likely still felt a broke college kid lol!  Hence I didn't order anything special the first time, but let's fastforward and change the subject...  = STARTERS = * We had the Baked Garlic Shrimp ($10) which was uber cheesy and buttery, and came with soft lil' dinner rolls. The shrimp seemed a bit small, but that's okay because I'm here for steak not necessarily seafood!  * Second, we gave the Escargot ($11) a try.  Now this was my first time trying snails, and will probably be the last too.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  Especially with the deep fragrant aroma and baked in cumin flavor, but I thought 'eh, its a snail', nothing special about it.  == DINNER == * She had the 7oz Filet ($35) medium-rare accompanied by a baked potato.  Actually a mashed potato filled one that had bacon and some herbs.  Sooo good!  As for the filet, she shared a bite and it was perfect with the Family Wine red blend we chose from Niagara.  * I had the 7oz Bleu Cheese Filet ($37), bacon wrapped with a side of asparagus.  Oh man, I truly enjoyed this one!  Just the combination of the soft warm cut with the saltiness of the cheese (which gave a dry-aged steak composition) and that roasted garlic all going down with that wine.  Ugggh, heaven!   Out with the old Ron, in with the new!  Yep that's basically how I felt!    === OVERALL === * This location was AWESOME!   * The fine helpful hostesses AWESOME!  * Atmosphere and our dining experience, AWESOME!   * Our waiter Josh, refilling our wine glasses and offered service to the nines!  TOTALLY AWESOME!   * Josh had even told us that the lady running around the place was his GM Angie.  She had lost her voice, but made her best to be able to present me with a birthday ice cream cake.  5-STARS AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Delightful waitresses. The food was average but everyone enjoyed their meal and we all left happy."}
{"text":"I only ended up eating here because all the other restaurants I wanted to eat at were jam packed. The Keg seemed a wee bit slower but was still busy. There was a wait for the patio so my friend and I decided to hit the lounge first as we waited for the patio to become available.  The A/C inside was on, as I was told by my server, but I was sweating inside and dying to get out to the patio. Even the server told me she was hot. That should be addressed especially since the summer is heating up now. This wasn't even one of the warmer days.   Our lounge server was friendly enough but I felt she was trying very hard to be cool. She was really young. I brushed it off because she wasn't rude - I just felt she was disinterested and one dimensional.   Finally! Out to the patio we go and what a breath of fresh air - literally. The server outside was training a new girl (all very young) but was friendlier, chattier and a better conversationalist.   The food arrives and my companion and I are very satisfied and happy. Wasn't interested in the dessert but the server twisted my arms!   All in all it was a good experience but every time I eat at the keg I feel as though I over paid for the experience, hence the deduction of one star."}
{"text":"We had The keg couple times but haven't been here for a while until last week recently. I was actually looking forward for the tiger shrimp dinner but with my luck they took it out of the menu . Not a steak person but came here for my husband . Although he said the steak was great! It must be the quality of the meat. I had the chicken wrapped in bacon and added tiger shrimp with it . Which is a bit pricey for me but as I said I was craving for shrimp that day and they didn't really have shrimp on the menu unless you order something and add on shrimp. And thats what I ended up doing. Anyway was not a fan if the chicken it was a bit salty for me . Coleslaw came with it and mashed potato and they were both great . There was a bit of wait on the server but not as bad."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite keg location.  Costumer service is top notch and most of the waiters and managers remember us and treat us like family every time we go. This is where I like to spend every important celebration."}
{"text":"Came here during the mother's day weekend with my boyfriend for an anniversary. We found a seat at the lounge and decided to eat there instead of the dining area that had an hour wait time. We started with bacon and scallops, which was delicious and cooked perfectly. I got the Ahi Tuna for my meal with a side of asiago rice... The slaw that the tuna came with was too basic, so I'm glad I got the rice. My boyfriend got the prime rib steak, cooked medium rare and he said it was perfect. Overall, great experience and a great server that took care of us very well!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Service is great, food is always great and it's perfect for a date. Can't complain to be honest. I've gone here 3 different times and it's always one of the best Keg's I go to."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Keg restaurants many times starting with the original in North Vancouver the week it opened, I enjoyed my meal tonight and would go again. I took some friends and all enjoyed a nice steak and lobster dinner that was cooked nicely, had good flavour and was served by a friendly professional waiter, I know this is a chain and has corporate ambience BUT in turn the quality is kept to a high standard. You can count on a meal that is good value for the money spent.  No doubt there are better, pricier places, but for a tasty meal you can depend on  you can find it wherever you find a Keg.  I found this to be a restaurant I will use again."}
{"text":"I generally avoid chain restaurants, but all the Kegs that I've been to downtown are solid as far as drinks, food and service. My friend and I visited this location around 9:30 pm last night and we both agreed that is was probably the worst Keg experience we've had.  First of all they need to ditch the canned service. It was annoying to have to answer a bunch of questions while the server took us to our table. Just please seat me and if you have something to say, please say it, but I hate when restaurants want their servers to be robots and remove their personality before service.   Why is there a dummy bottle of wine on each table? Wine is not a decoration and I wish chains wold get over this trendy sales strategy.  We went for the Meomi Belle Gloss Pinot Noir. Aside from the initial pour, no one revisited our table to top up our wine. If you want your servers to do a good job, ditch the script and let them focus on the guest. We poured out the whole bottle ourselves because our servers were so busy giving speeches to other tables and wasting time with a whole bunch of information that no one really wanted to hear.  The other thing that kind of sucked was that they brought all our nibblies to the table at once. I hadn't eaten all day so we ordered a lot of food: nachos, calamari, mushrooms neptune, escargot and scallops in bacon. We didn't expect everything to come at once. Especially to a little table of 2. It seemed like the server should have coursed things out-- especially since there was calamari, which, if you don't get to it right away goes rubbery and is ruined. Fair enough, the server acknowledged this on his own and offered to take the calamari back and then bring us a fresh order when were finished most of our other items. But when we got the new calamari is was super greasy, as if it had been swimming in not hot enough oil for a long time.   We told our server this and he took it off the bill, which was very nice of him. But I couldn't help the feeling that these servers just can't think for themselves and the productivity suffers.   When I visit the Keg downtown in Toronto, I never have to listen to a speech on my way to the table, I never get asked a bunch of dumb questions like \"Have you been here before?\" It's a freaking KEG, they're all the same and not that different than any other chain restaurant. Who hasn't been to a Keg in their lifetime? I don't like having to fill in a verbal survey before I even sit down.   Also, I'm by no means a feminist, but all the servers in the bar wearing their skimpy outfits? Come on. Why are these women expected to dress like playboy bunnies at work? A nice black dress is fine, but honestly, I don't need to see that much T&A when I come for a casual drink. It's blatant objectification of women. Also, if a potential employee didn't fit into a skimpy dress like that would they hire her? I think not. Why could a man not work in the lounge? Restaurants need to get over the glossy way that things look and start encouraging their staff to be people. I know the attire of the lounge staff is the same across the board at all Kegs, but I don't appreciate it.  Not a great experience here and it may have turned me off The Keg in general."}
{"text":"We waited 1.5 hours but the manager came up to our table and gave us free appetizer. Overall good service but don't go during prime time (6-8pm) on a Saturday as it is completely packed."}
{"text":"The Keg is always a unanimous choice in my family. There's always something for everyone on their menu. Our favorite is their french onion soup. We usually order one each because nobody wants to share. It's that good. Their steaks are very satisfying as well. We always end our meal with the Billy Miners Pie."}
{"text":"Went for third wedding anniversary dinner. HORRIBLE service!!!! Orders were taken and appetizers arrived wout incident. Asked for more bread when entrees arrived and was completely forgotten about. Did not check in on us the rest of the meal. Took another half hour after we had already finished our meal to flag down the server for the bill. Food was good but would never come back due to the dreadful service. I would give this less than a one star if I could!!"}
{"text":"Love the Keg. Always get great service at this location. Ran a few minutes late on giving us our apps and they came up to our table and apologized and gave us the app for free without us saying anything. Aside from that, food is always delish and satisfying as always. 10/10"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto chose to have dinner here. The service was exquisite and the ambiance is perfect for a date. I ordered the pistachio crusted salmon that came with garlic mashed potatoes and Brussels.   The salmon was perfectly cooked poorly seasoned.  The mashed potatoes helped revive my tastebuds along with the Brussels.   Great place!"}
{"text":"Clearly one of the better big meatetarian chain restaurants. And they are solid and consistent in the delivery. We have been to this one in Brampton many times. We love coming here for the service and food. I recommend the Prime Rib rare to med-rare. My lovely wife likes the filet mignon, with the Oscar sauce as an add-on. Ask them they will do it. I don't like bacon on my filet, but she swears by it. Personal choice I guess. Also if they have the braised short ribs on special, JUMP on them, they are Fantastic! The escargot as an appi are super good. 5 out of 5 for service. 4 out of 5 for food."}
{"text":"So had a little family night dinner with my loves tonight and it was pretty busy at the keg.  The hostess said our wait time was about 10-15 minutes, but we got seated a lot sooner which was fantastic!    We got the escargot and calamari as our starters.  I got the sirloin Oscar, medium rare with a twice baked potato.  Hubby got pistachio crusted salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and the little one got chicken strips with fries.  I would have to say our steak and salmon were cooked to perfection!  Our server was great, she was attentive the whole evening and brought us refills when our drinks were low.  The only downfall to our night was the way the tables were setup.  We were very close to the tables next to us on both sides of us which made it hard for an intimate setting.  The table next to us was a couple and they had a little kissing session across their table which was very awkward for us.  The table we were sat at would have been good for a large group of people sitting together.  You could pretty much hear your neighbours conversations and we weren't even speaking that loud as we were seated closely.  Overall, a good night...food was great and our server was very pleasant!  I wish I would start remembering my servers names to be able to give credit or keep my receipts lol  If I go back to this location, I would try to ask for a more sectioned off table, but it's Friday night, they were busy so I understand."}
{"text":"I try to avoid chain restaurants because there are so many cool spots to explore in Toronto. But you know when you're just craving steak and you don't want to go somewhere that will surprise you with tiny portions or serve it to you cooked the wrong way? That's why The Keg is great.  Steaks are always cooked perfectly and the service is outstanding. Drinks and vibe are pretty good too. I always get the Keg Classic menu option that comes with a starter salad, steak, warm bread for the table, and all the trimmings. Food and service are 5 star, but honestly it's just not that cool.   Secret menu tip: Don't forget to ask for the herb cheese butter for your bread. They don't advertise it."}
{"text":"Great service, the burger was exceptionally great tasting! The patty came out medium just like I liked it, the slaw that came along as a side was to die for! If you're ever in Canada this specific location is where it's at!"}
{"text":"My favorite Keg. Much much better than the one on 5th St. The staff is great, the ambiance is great, and the prime rib is the best. This one is worth the wait and the money!"}
{"text":"I go about six times a year and eat in the bar. Food is always good. Caesar salad and strip loin is good. Love the shrimp cocktail but never large enough. Staff in the bar are great. Never met so many unemployed teachers. Sign of the times. Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings after five be prepared to wait an hour for the dinning room. Reservations not taken on weekends."}
{"text":"I opted for the ribs as I've had steak twice already within the past week.  $21 for a half rack made it the most reasonably priced menu item. The ribs were quite nice, very tender.  The slaw was good too. The fries were a disaster. They're obviously not prepared fresh and probably came frozen in giant plastic bags. Any restaurant that has the nerve to charge $20+ for their entrees should be hand cutting their potatoes . These were beyond bad.  Any fast food chain I've ever been to easily has better fries. Truthfully I could have had a better meal for a lot less at Swiss Chalet. Stick to the steaks and avoid the fries as a side.  Chains are all about consistency, which means there's nothing special going on in the kitchen. No thanks, I felt like I was at a fake nice restaurant. On a positive note, the service was good and the drinks were reasonable."}
{"text":"Servers are really well trained. Even better than the service you get at Jacobs. Value for you meal. You get what you pay for tho. Prime rib is good and so are the steaks. I would pass on the dessert tho. I would come back again."}
{"text":"This was our first time to The Keg. The staff was very friendly. She even took time to make recommendations of things to try when visiting the city. At the end of our meal they brought out a cake to wish us a happy anniversary. The food was also all very good and cooked as we asked."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable experience at The Keg on King. The restaurant is swanky and quite large. Our server was excellent. And the food was very good. We had filet mignon, ribeye and scallops, and all were or high quality and tastefully and traditionally prepared. The wine selection was very good, though I was disappointed with the pre-dinner cocktail preparation, particularly the Manhattan with the run-of-the-mill neon red jarred cherry."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to go here.  The food quality is always good and consistant and the portions are decent.  If you want prime rib or a good steak this is a great place.  I also like the dining room design so its not as loud as you would think with all the particians.  I have been here several times and will return for sure.  Its a  great place to go as a group or family gathering.  Try the sirloin oscar or the prime rib.  Those are my favorites"}
{"text":"ONE STAR BECAUSE THAT'S THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATING.   We walked in with a group of 9 of us. Was placed in a fairly secluded section (I believe the library room) on a sunday (I rememeber specifically because we just came from Cabana. Starving and decided to find a reliable restaurant to fill our empty tummies.   We ordered our food and after 45 minutes of having only one appetizer brought out to our entire table we decided to ask our waitress how long is our food going to take. She said she'll ask the kitchen and get back to us. She came back and told us that they're pretty busy tonight and how it's just a bit backed up.   Then the manager came to our table to once again apologize for the delay and said that due to the long wait, our appetizers will be covered and how our order will be on its way.   20 minutes after we had ask our waitress about our meal, complimentary shrimp cocktails came out (which we didn't order) and they said it was complimentary. At this point, no one was talking because we were beyond starving, we were simply HANGRY (for those who don't know, it's a hybrid of hungry and angry) we ate those shrimp cocktails so darn fast and was like okay..MOOOOORE. Nothing came til another 15-20 minutes which was our appetizer that we ordered. (Mind you, at this point we realized what happened....OUR WAITRESS MUST OF FORGOT TO PUT IN OUR ORDER AND SHE PUNCHED IT IN WHEN WE HAD TO REMIND HER WHERE WAS OUR FOOD????)   After our app...the food came out in about 15-20 minutes but by then, nothing tasted good...we just wanted to fill our starving bellies and get out!.   To be completely honest, after sharing this story with a few friends out of rage....they said our entire meal should of been taken care of. Which upset me because i totally agree...THE KEG is a fairly pricey place and the service was simply unacceptable, I believe we shouldn't have paid a single dollar. This incident actually took place about three and a half months ago but what triggered me to do a review today is because a friend asked me to go eat at the keg and it traumatized me to the point where i said HELL NO! and so i had to begin my rant :)"}
{"text":"Went with 10 people November 4th and wouldn't return. While waiting for a few people in our party to arrive, we were told that if they didn't show up in 5 minutes, they were taking our table away! The fun didn't end there...$715.00 bill and while we were eating dessert, we were asked to go into the lounge so they could have our table for other customers! WTF?? Two waitresses kept mixing up orders and not getting everyone's orders and taking away beer bottles that weren't empty....My steak was tough and very fatty but the Bellini was very good. Overall for the money, this was the worst Keg I have ever visited. I was embarrassed to be asked to leave, felt horrible and stressed out waiting for my party to be complete so as to not lose our table and next time, we will go somewhere that we are wanted and appreciated. Hey, Keg...booze brings in a lot of money so best not to rush your customers out. Oh, yeah, we were told about a two hour maximum stay rule.....Keg, this location SUCKS!"}
{"text":"This was the only Keg in Calgary we had yet to visit - so tonight was the night!  Of course at 7:15pm on a Friday night there was a wait, 20 min but we did not mind. A drink at the bar? Sure! We were waited on by a good looking twin of one of the Jersey Boys characters, tan, hair and all. He was very nice. Then on time or even before the 20 min mark, a hostess came over to get us and took us to our table.  I was surprised to see all the babies/kids at this Keg but thankfully in our area, it was quiet enough and close to the fireplace!  We got a nice booth and were seated, our waiter was prompt and personable. We ordered and as always, the restaurant was kind enough to split my hubby's Caesar salad with his Classic top sirloin meal. I love it when the plates are cold, the salad is cold and crisp and the Keg delivered on that tonight! The meals came, we both got 12oz steaks and hubby's was massive. Either his was overweight or mine was underweight but at any rate I got the baseball sirloin which is always a hunk-a-meat treat. I ordered mine rare, was a little overdone but I was starving. No biggie.  The Keg staff at this location has great communication with each other. We had different people helping us provide cutlery, another for bread, another delivered our meals and it was all at a good pace - and the place was packed. A bar manager even came to our table at the end of the meal and welcomed us in for our first visit - nice! We felt appreciated and never rushed.  The washrooms at this location are quite nice and new looking. We were told the restaurant is 6-7 years old.  While it was not the best steak I have ever had at the Keg, the overall consistency was there and the star of the dish was the twice baked potato. SO good! Accompanied by the steaks were 4 sprigs of asparagus (a yummy surprise as it is now out of season and unavailable at the grocery stores) and some chunks of red pepper that added a little colour and pizzazz to the plates. We had to skip dessert, we were too full and we had to bring half our meals home. That sourdough bread is perhaps just too good and is a damn fine filler, served warm and fresh!  We would certainly come back to this location if we were back in that area."}
{"text":"Mother's Day outing.    Pineapple splash cocktail was fruity fun.  Tuna tartare, calamari, Caesar salad to start.  Pistachio crusted salmon, top sirloin, portobello mushroom, half rack ribs for mains.  They have improved the tuna tartare by serving it now with light crispy chips.  Last time I had it they had these hard thick wonton chips that were not a good complement.  The tuna is fresh and now a perfect dish.  Calamari was perfectly cooked and delish.  Steak is always good and salmon filet was cooked perfectly.  I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch!  For a chain restaurant I think they do a decent job in terms of consistent quality of food and attentive service.  Keep it up The Keg!!"}
{"text":"Donna was so incredibly nice and helped us with everything we needed.  It was my first time here and loved the experience!"}
{"text":"Done! May never return. New manager was the most ignorant person I have ever encountered in the service industry.   What a difference a year and a half staying away from  local favorite can make. My favorite staff are all here and the menu elevated.   Thank you Don"}
{"text":"The keg is always consistent.  The food is excellent quality and the service is impeccable. Or so I thought.  HOWEVER. we came tonight, a party of 4 for a belated birthday.  We had reserved it saying it was a birthday dinner. (No mention of it from waiter, or a cake as they usually do)  Anywho.  The birthday girl ordered the prime rib medium rare.  It came out pretty well done and it was the butt of the piece. Half of it was just fat, no lie. We complained to the waiter and his reply was \"yeah I can see its a little on the medium side. It's our last piece so... \"  Really? . The bday girl was too nice and kept It. Anywho. 10 min no manager.  No offer to switch entree no nothing. She had to order more au jus because it was so dry. She emphasized on that when ordering but the waiter just ignored her comment and walked away before she even finished explaining.    I ordered the salad with a sirloin added on. The steak was cold. I didn't even want to say anything seeing out nothing is going to come out of it anyways.    I asked for the manager on my way to the washroom.  Came back, manager didn't come. Our dessert however came out, a mini brown and two creme brulees. Mid eating he comes with the bill, we had not asked for it and would have ordered more drinks.  Mind you it's 930 and closing time is 11pm. Why are we being rushed? The waiter explained that if he had known that it was the last cut and that it wasn't medium rare he would have said something but he didn't know. So what? You brought it out, we complained, why not offer to switch entree? Unacceptable. He said \"but don't worry we took care of some things on the bill for you\" .   What was he talking about? Oh, she got her drink free and her mini dessert free. For a total of 10.50$ \"on us\" on a bill that totalled $280 and change.    I'm so disappointed.  I've raved about the keg and their high standards, consistency, and reasonable pricing. I guess not."}
{"text":"Went to Canyon Creek Chophouse but they took out their porkchops...for a chop house? common!   Anyways, The keg is always our go to spot because it's reliable. We were not dissapointed!   We ordered shrimp cocktails and escargot perfect as always. the cocktail sauce had fresh horseradish in it unlike other places and had a good hit. The bread with the moussed butter was fresh and hot!  we ordered 2 10oz prime rib and 1 14oz prime rib all medium rare. they came out pretty well done. the lighting makes it seem more pink, but after shining our phone lights on it it was completely brown! we sent it back and not only were they nice about it, they replaced it all with perfectly medium rare cuts AND free desserts. thats four desserts ($40 worth). The manager came by and apologize   this is why i love The Keg. any location.   Food 10/10  Price 10/10 great prices for excellent food Customer service 10/10 Drinks 10/10 keg size ceasar with Kettle one! Ambiance 10/10 relax, cool, fun, music but still quiet enough for a chat."}
{"text":"If I was reviewing the restaurant on the quality of the steak I had, or the wine or even value for money I would award five stars, but... We, a group of twelve, were sat at a table more suited to eight people, making service and dining less pleasant. The staff were helpful and tolerant, but not very observant when things were not satisfactory, although problems were addressed correctly once they were aware. My French onion soup was mediocre at best and did not augur well for the entree. However the baseball steak was a treat, succulent and cooked as I requested. The sides were not important but were satisfactory. My wife had a steak salad which was poorly presented but again the steak was excellent. I believe this restaurant could easily achieve a five star rating by focusing on the details and giving more space to the diners.  All in all a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"The keg always serves up perfection when it comes to food, and if they miss a beat, they make up for it with exceptional service. This location is filled with Woodbridge's most entitled crews though and since they don't take reservations, you end up waiting in a storm of eye rolls and an aura of misperceived notions of grandeur. Bless the staff who puts up with it with a smile."}
{"text":"My bf and I celebrated our 1000th day at The Keg.  Mind you, I have never been a steak gal, something which is recently changing.  All I can say is that The Keg serves some mean steaks and I can't help but gravitate towards them now.   Although many branches have similar tastes for design, this branch really ups the ante.  With its mammoth brickwork, it fits perfectly into the well to do landscape of King St.  Also, once you enter and pass by the security/bouncers, who greet you warmly, you will be transported to an upscale world composed of dim lighting, dark wooden furniture, fire places,  abstract art and high-ceiling washrooms.  Perfect for celebrations, dates and business outings, the ambiance is lavish and fail-safe.   In the past, I was a pescatarian and thus only dined on their seafood items. They were decent, but they were definitely not the restaurant's trump cards.  Fortunately, as I have gone back to my meativore ways, I tried two Keg Classics last Sunday: A Top Sirloin and a Filet Mignon, both of which were paired with mushrooms, vegetables, and an accompaniment.    For our accompaniments, we chose mashed potato and the twice baked potato.  The mashed potato was rich, buttery and delectable with bursts of meaty goodness from the bacon bits.  But you know what? The twice baked potato was the bomb! It was the gold medalist of sides with its creamy texture, complementary seasonings, rich flavour, and beautiful, golden presentation. I am not a fan of rich foods, mind you. I'm that despicable diner who wipes the cream off cakes.  However, the twice baked potato won me over, so I highly recommend it to all you potato lovers out there!  Additionally, the steaks were slammin'!  Everyone has a different viewpoint of what medium rare, rare, well done, and all those cooking styles are.  In fact, my bf is very particular about his rare meats.  He's been to the other popular Keg on York St., where his steaks are often over done by one level (if he orders rare, it'll come out medium rare). Fortunately, at this branch, both our steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare (for me) and rare (for him).  Of course, this may have just been us, so I advise you to ask your server what they consider to be rare, medium rare, medium, and so forth before selecting a style.   We thoroughly enjoyed our Top Sirloin and Filet Mignon.  They were not too charred to the point of having a burnt or charcoal undertone, and they dripped with delicious jus.  Each mouthful brought a smile to my face, a former steak negligent.  What I do regret doing that I will warn you all about, however, is to avoid savouring the steak for too long. It doesn't feel as juicy when it's cold, and if you're a slower eater, you may want to ask your server to warm it up.   Now, on the flip side of the coin, I had my personal gripes with the salads and the side of vegetables.  For our Keg Classic platters, we received a side of greens (asparagus, I believe).  I gravitate towards vegetables that are on the softer side, so I wasn't a fan of the ''raw'' flavour of the greens. Also, while the Mixed Greens Salad was well dressed without any bitter notes, the Ice Berg Salad was a bit of a disappointment.  I was hoping that the greens and blue cheese dressing would have already been chopped up and tossed before serving.  To my dismay, my bf and I had to dismantle the massive ice berg vegetable ourselves and stir in the minimal amount of dressing.  To say the least, this secondary salad was bland and watery because we weren't able to cut everything small enough to smother in the sauce (dinner cutlery can only do so much!). I would not recommend this salad, but perhaps it's a favourite for others.  You may want to have your server ask the chef to chop it up and toss it before serving....unless you really want a challenge.  In the spirit of the holidays, let me just state that The Keg is on my Nice List.  Although the prices are hazardous for my budget, I will definitely return for an upscale night out. Until next time, Twice Baked Potato and Filet Mignon!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great, and very consistent.  I have an apartment in the Fashion House just upstairs, so come here often and am always treated well and enjoy the food.  The ambiance is awesome, and even without reservations, you can usually find a great seat in the lounge area.  As for the food, you can't go wrong with either the bacon wrapped scallops, the stuffed mushrooms or the tuna tartare for an appetizer -- all are awesome.  The steaks are really good too, a great value for money.  The sirloin is awesome and the filet (medium-rare or medium) is cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Definitely a go-to spot if you're kicking it in King West."}
{"text":"So again, me and my guy went for dinner last night (we go out a lot apparently!) and this time we went to the Keg. Yum!!! The wait was only 15 minutes which was great for a Sunday night. We were seated promptly and our waiter came along quickly.   First regardless of the food, I have to talk about a drink. I discovered the mudslide two weeks ago when I was at the keg, but I'm telling you, this is like dessert in a glass!!! it's chocolately and so yummy. Almost like a milkshake! Sooo good :) Their daquiris are pretty good too but nothing beats The Cattle Baron for that!   We skipped appetizers which was good because I wasn't starving. We took forever to order like usual and ended up having steak (shocker..) I had the Steak Oscar which is what I had last time except with chicken. It was sooooo yummy. The Bearnaise sauce is so delicious and the scallops are unbelievably rich. I always order mashed potatoes because they are my favorite :)   The Keg was very accommodating and made my date's dish substituting steak for chicken. He had the steak creole. The waiter said that people always request this so they should just add it to the menu. He seemed to enjoy it because he ate it all and i took half mine home. For dessert I attempted to eat my creme brulee but this thing was fricken huge!! Who can even digest all that custard????  Overall The Keg is always an enjoyable experience and I always look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Pros: Quick service, good calamari, nice decor, Ceasar salad above average.  Cons: Prime rib was not the best we've had from the Keg, vegetables were overcooked, service was indifferent.  Verdict: Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner at The Keg tonight. Food like always was phenomenal. Our server was above and beyond helpful. What I like most about this place is they accommodate there customers. I had to breastfeed my 4week old daughter and the server and hostess were kind enough to set me up with a chair in the women's bathroom. This gesture was definitely much appreciated. Definitely would revisit this location based on customer service and food."}
{"text":"I had not been to a Keg anywhere for about 25+ years, and kinda hankered for some good red meat. Back then when still a newer concept, the meal had been substantial and well-flavoured. Even so, we went here because it was mid-afternoon and the Brazilian and other steak places weren't open until 5pm.  Overall a good meal, but fell short on a few things. My wife had average-tasting ribs with fries and chopped salad/cole slaw: her meal overall was an only average 3-stars. I had prime rib with stuffed potato and veggies: the prime rib was excellent, nicely cooked and tender; the stuffed potato a real winner (!) and the accompanying red peppers were good; the green beans were skinny and hardly tasted them (overall 4.25). The small glass of Californian cab we shared was great as a chaser, and helped accent the red meat (4). The large breadroll we shared was quite wonderful: the super-soft flaky interior well complemented by real whipped butter. So nice! (4.5)  Service was very good, but as usual the setting was darker than seems suitable on a bright warm afternoon.  Getting there is a bit of a puzzle re. all the dumb rule-bound city lanes and barred-street entrances, as The Keg is right beside the road: so takes lotsa patience for the pretzel maneuvers needed before finally parking your vehicle outside their door. Duh!  If you've not done the Keg before, check it out. Their prime rib has always been their thing, and you likely won't be disappointed. I'd suggest you pass on the barely-passable ribs and get a thick steak instead? And, as they are no better than McDo's, skip the fries: replace them with the mashed, stuffed or baked potato.  Not do red meat very often, but was worth it."}
{"text":"Terrific food, good value, great service, and comfortable ambience.  What more can you ask for? My favorite restaurant for over 15 years!"}
{"text":"Good food for a steak house chain. Good prices, good service, good cocktails, good steak. Nothing to complain about. Nothing fancy or notable either, simple presentation, simply a decent meal."}
{"text":"service very friendly and helpful. they happily accommodated us when we wanted to change tables. steak cooked well. had a very good experience and would recommend this location to friends. Ahi tuna was superb as well, surprisingly. Tender as a cozy winter night with a new lover."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent steak.  I almost walked into the Milestone restaurant but decided to try this place.  I sat at the bar and Stephanie quickly learned my name (as well as every other customer) and talked to each of us by first name.  I ordered a spicy bloody mary and it was great.  I ordered the steak salad and it far exceeded my expectations.  The filet was an excellent cut and the flavor was amazing.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is a great location, I typically get great service when I come. If you're looking for well cooked steak at a good price, you can't go wrong with The Keg."}
{"text":"So... I've been to the Keg many times in Vancouver. It's always good.  I decided to treat my team to this location after work arriving around 1030pm.  Well, as per another review,  I would avoid it's location at night.  Service is terrible.  Non smiling waitresses, brining one loaf of bread (with 4 pieces ) for a table of 6, serving us incorrect appies, no drink refills, waitresses arguing with each other , arguing with the bartender, it just doesn't seem like they want to be there for the night crowd. I'm guessing there was 6 employees to 12 to 14 guests at this late hour but still, the service sucked.   The food was good. But service is about 40% of the score.  I went to Jacob and spent just about the same for just myself. But they nailed service and the food although I went to Jacob around 6pm vs 11pm at the keg.   I think I'll try another Keg location next time."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to The Keg tonight. Traveling alone, I chose to dine at the bar as is my custom. Megan and her colleagues provided stellar service. The Keg offers an ample selection of wines by the glass, and the zinfandel they offered (no, I don't recall the vintage) was delightful at $13 for a 9 oz pour.  I chose the 10 ounce prime rib, which was perfectly prepared and accompanied with raw horseradish (a \"must\" in my book), delicious au jus, and garlic mashed potatoes.   Five stars is a big deal by Yelp standards. Service must be superb. Atmosphere needs to shine. And, of course, the fare must be of exceptional quality. I experienced each of these tonight. I have one more night in Toronto...who knows, I just might return!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter which location you visit most of the keg restaurants are all very much the same. The food is great the service is dependable and you're going to spend roughly $50 per person. It straightforward. Whoever has not tried the keg should try it at least once and the regulars already know why they go there what they get each time.   I have tried their filet mignon and their chicken and most of their appetizers and I have never been disappointed. They get the order pretty accurately especially with how you want your steak."}
{"text":"I went about 3 times to this location and each time it has been great service and ambience. My boyfriend and I visit the Keg quite often and this location never fails to satisfy us.   The only downfall I'd have to say is that each time we came, they always ran out of escargots. Hopefully we can get some the next time we visit!"}
{"text":"We were told of the West King St. restaurant scene from a server on the waterfront. There were a LOT of great options and we were thankful for the tip. Saw The Keg and it's outside patio seating.. perfect for an August early evening dinner.   They had some kind of Lobster Summer special going on, which we were happy to see. The menu sounded great, and was exactly what we were looking for before our Second City show started.   Great food, more than we'd expected for this (smaller) chain restaurant, but the service was the best part. Every person that tended us was smiling, attractive, and generally happy to see us there. Chains aren't my thing, but I would return to The Keg, either on King St or otherwise, just to see if the experience is similar, which I'd have to assume was part of the culture at this restaurant.   Nice work, Keg Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Second time here. We (group of two) also came right at 4:10PM on a Friday night (yesterday). We were seated immediately after we were greeted. Didn't wait long for our drinks, menu, order and our actual dishes. I gotta say thank you to Adrijana, our server for the evening for her professional attention to our dinner. She had a trainee with her and no glitches to be had.   Between us two, we ordered scotch, wine, sangria, and no appetizers because, come on, the meat is a yummy appetizer/main course: and dessert. Well, we did have actual dessert too because it was a first night out after so long. We had the Keg Classic: fillet mignon with mashed potatoes, and New York Striploin with mashed potatoes, both medium rare. Deliciously cooked. Just the way we wanted our meat cooked.   We were quite full after our dinner and no aches. It was just a good night of good meat dinner. Better service this time, with smaller group, at early bird dinner time. Still had time to do errands afterwards."}
{"text":"Had a fairly  nice dinner at the keg, with a few pros and cons;  It's started with their confusing gluten free menu, which has no description or prices! and the server again not familiar with it or how to read it!! Here's what we had, I enjoyed their fillet which was slightly over cooked (again) but tasty, it came with the double baked potatoe, (which was a bit on the sour side, perhaps too much sour cream?)  the kids refused their dinners completely! which 'looked'  fairly good; kids sliders and chicken fingers one with fried the other with steamed veggies, which were the most Bland and tasteless vegetables that I personally have ever tried) also, a bit over priced at $9.99 and came with a scoop of ice cream.... Compared to the average 6.99-7.99$ in other restaurants... My husband had the chicken and ribs, which was practically a kiddy size compared to other places. The food tasted good, but the value was not there at all but can easily be improved.  We enjoy the interior and the majority of the seating is booths which creates a more comfortable ambience. And the servers are good.   It is not our first visit, we enjoy their food, but there's plenty of room for improvement; especially since they pride themselves for being the best location...."}
{"text":"We've been fans of the Keg for a long time. You can count on a great atmosphere and great food. That said, great food and atmosphere means nothing if the service sucks.  We've been to the Keg before however this was our first visit to the Keg's South Pointe location.   The Keg doesn't accept reservations on Thursdays, Fridays or Saturday nights so we arrived at 5:30pm and luckily we did - we were told it would be a 30 minute wait... no big deal, there was room in the bar to sit and enjoy a drink with each other. As an added feature, they've got a number of 40\" TVs easily seen from anywhere in the bar - tonight, it happened to be the Leafs hosting the Penguins - 1 nothing Leafs.  40 minutes in the bar later, our table was ready and off we went. Leafs and Penguins tied at 1 - not that I was watching or anything.  From the moment we sat down in our seats, looking forward to our dinner, the moment we left, the service was excellent. Our server's name was Angie. Very well spoken, highlighted some of their menu options and specials and simply took great care of us.   As for the food, we've never had a bad meal at the Keg and today was no exception - you get exactly what  you expect. Great food.   So why four stars and not five? Because I'm selfish. Because I wish we could make dinner reservations.  Have a great night at the Keg and ask to be seated in Angie's section - you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here to the bar last Wednesday. It was a slow night in the bar. Bartender ignored my girl(friend) and I to where I had to get her attention, she looked at me like I had two heads. I asked if they were still open as we were not getting served. She said yes and finally (and rudly) took our order as if we were being a pain. I have been here 5-7 times before and had no problem. I'm afraid the King west \"bartender entitlement\" is creeping into this place. I hope that's not the case."}
{"text":"The Keg has awesome garlic cheese bread, but not so tasty salads.  I only give this place 3 stars because it's really just okay.  You don't get consistent quality with the steak, which is something I expect from a \"steakhouse\".  Especially when you visit the Keg, you see that the majority of the patrons order steak, so what kind of excuse could they have for not cooking your steak right?    Anyway, one time I came here and the ribeye was fantastic! It was Chicago style medium, and it was so succulent and perfect that I thought I was in heaven.  I liked it so much, I went back asap and ordered the same Chicago style medium.  What I received was a well-done super duper dry ribeye.  I didn't send it back though, I was starving.  Another time, I received an awesome filet mignon with crab legs, then the next time, the filet mignon was like a sirloin steak - not at all buttery melt in your mouth meat, but hard chewy meat instead.  Where is the consistency? Maybe their cooks have different skill levels, but in that case, re-train your chefs please!  It's sad to say, that when I come here, I'm not sure if they will cook my steak right, and that's just not right cause it's not a cheap place to have dinner."}
{"text":"Yum! This is the kind of steak dreams are made of. 12 oz of juicy, tender steak with a great selection of sides, just what the doctor ordered.  The staff was very nice and attentive, and came to refill beverages and ask if everything was ok at just the right rate.  We sat at the lounge part of the restaurant which had dimmed lights and an overall cozy environment.  We were a bunch of people, and we mostly ordered different kinds of steaks. Not one of us were disappointed in their selection. We all enjoyed the food very much, and even if the portions were large, we were all craving for more.  They sport several different sections - the lounge area where we sat, the bar and a more plain vanilla restaurant setting.  Free wifi is offered as well, by the way.  All in all an excellent experience both food wise and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the filet minion with wedge salad, yum, yum  Great food, staff, atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely shocking service !!  Sat there for 20 minutes before getting served. Got one menu between 3 of us, a family came in next to us and where taken care of straight away. They had their starters and were on their mains before we got our meals. The food was excellent, but they were certainly off their game !! Worst server ever!"}
{"text":"Quality and service are always top notch. Pricy but you get what you pay for in customer satisfaction and food quality.   Servers will change your meals if its not to your liking and are kind about it."}
{"text":"Always great service and fantastic food. The few times we were less than satisfied, they listened to us and made things right.   Most restaurants have one or two good things on the menu. The Keg has many great things to eat. I find myself eating more than I should because they are so good.   The wait time can be tough to handle on a Friday or Saturday night but during the week we typically walk right in.   Recommended to anyone that likes steak or seafood."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday with a group of four. Food was amazing the staff were great. Have to get here early though if you want a spot. If your coming around 5-6pm looking at an hour wait which is normal I guess for the keg. Great location though with lots of parking. Will be coming back again forsure."}
{"text":"We went for a nice prime rib dinner with the whole family.  We went early so that we wouldn't have to wait as you normally would if you get there later.  We were promptly seated and given our menus.  They brought out the bread and a kids snack plate for the little ones.  This is always a huge hit for the young ones as it comes with fruit, crackers, veggies and dip.  It keeps the kids occupied and therefore buys you time.  We ordered the prime rib classic and started with a Caesar salad which was great as usual.  The prime rib dinners came out shortly after and cooked to perfection.  I got the twice baked potato which just melts in your mouth and honestly is their best side dish.  It also came with roasted peppers, mushrooms and green beans.  The veggies were a bit over roasted, but still good.  The au juis and horse radish were a perfect compliment to the prime rib.  We decided to get creme br√ªl√©e for dessert and the Kristo coffee.  The creme br√ªl√©e was absolutely perfection.  The top layer was nice and crispy.  I devoured it in no time.  The coffee was a nice treat as well.  The service overall was perfection.  Our waiter was very attentive and I appreciated the great service we got."}
{"text":"Great food, service was above and beyond! We came with a big party for my brother in laws birthday. Every single one of us enjoyed our food and time. We'll definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Service was great!! Loved the food ill be back I went in on a Friday night and had no wight"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the keg. Came here twice during my trip to Toronto. The first time I got the chicken supreme. It came with garlic mash and brussels sprouts which I love. The second time i got the 10 oz filet mignon with a baked potato. The meat was perfectly cooked. The keg never lets me down whether in Montreal or Toronto."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place after seeing it while shopping in the area. Decided to try it out, to no disappointment.   They are best known for their steaks, so of course I couldn't leave without trying one.   The server told me their most popular steak is their prime rib, but they were sold out of it that night so I tried the rib steak. Overall I would give it a 8/10, the steak was pretty soft, the center was tender, and the sauce complimented it really nicely.   I got it with a half rack of ribs, as the waiter suggested, since it was only $15. He told me they are more known for steaks, not ribs, so he warned me it might not be the same as other places. The ribs I would give a 6-7/10, they were okay, but I'm glad I didn't order them as my main meal. The BBQ sauce was too overpowering for me, and the meat wasn't as tender as I would like.   For an appetizer I ordered Korean Style Cauliflower, and it was amazing. Definitely 10/10. I loved it. They put too much green onion on top, but it was so delicious I don't want to deduct a point for that.   All in all, this place is great. I will come back again!"}
{"text":"So I went back in for a friends birthday. Unfortunately I wasn't able to take photos of my sirloin steak I had done rare, with an extra side of veggies... But boy oh boy do their steaks go down very easily.  In most places I have visited, I haven't been able to cut the steak thoroughly or priperly without some membrane coming off, or the meat being cooked medium well as opposed to rare or medium rare. Let's put it this way, it cuts like butter and the taste is incomparable. I often find myself going to The Keg when I want a steak because the atmosphere is absolutely welcoming.  Our server was absolutely amazing. I may not be an anime fan, but most if not all of my friends I was with are, and it was amazing how our server connected with everyone and checked up on us every 15 minutes or so. If there's one thing I really enjoy about this place, it's the key attention to customer service, and them making sure the meal gets to the right person, made the exact way we like it.  I also want to add brownie points for the free bread to satiate my hunger before our meal. It is always a lovely thought and the fact that it is free is an even better gesture on their end.  All in all, despite the fact that The Keg is indeed a chain restaurant, the staff here do most certainly care about the clientele they cater to, and definitely deserve the five star rating!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I always continue to go to the Keg. I do love it, it is a good date night but I can no longer justify going to the Keg and buying a $30 steak when I can buy one from the grocery store for less and I know that it is cooked the way I like. For some reason, even though it is a steak place they can never get anyone's steak cooked the way they ordered.  This last experience though my cousin got a blue cheese steak wrapped in bacon and it was absolutely to die for! It was so delicious. It was the other three people at our table: my mom, grandma and grandpa who got the classic steaks and they were all cooked wrong.  I got the cauliflower steak and I was disappointed in it. This was my waitresses fault but I asked her what came and she said just asparagus on the side so I added mashed potatoes because I thought it wouldn't be filling enough. When it came out there was half a cauliflower, the asparagus, my mashed potatoes as well as a wonderful medley of vegetables and beans mixed together on top. If I would have known these were going to come with the meal I wouldn't have spent the extra money on the potatoes. Not only that but also n the veggie mix was olives and mushrooms (both things I cannot stand) so if I would have known the veggies were coming I would have asked what was in it and then asked for no mushrooms or olives. The beans in it were delicious though.  && you can never go wrong with the keg because of the fresh and warm sourdough bread :)  Updated Review as of February 2018: I agree with everything I said before but now would like to add to it. Because I go here so often I decided to go through the list and breakdown everything I have had and tried on the menu and whether I recommend it or not:  Keg Classics:  - Prime RIb- RECOMMEND - Filet Mignon- RECOMMEND -  Ribs: -  Steak and Seafood: RECOMMEND - Steak and Crab: RECOMMEND - Steak and Lobster: RECOMMEND -  Fish: - Pistachio Crusted Salmon: RECOMMEND - Sesame Ahi Tuna: RECOMMEND -  Chicken: -  Starters: - Shrimp Cocktail: RECOMMEND - Baked Garlic Shrimp: RECOMMEND - Crispy Fried Cauliflower: RECOMMEND - Calamari:  RECOMMEND - Tuna Tartare: RECOMMEND  Salads (Have had every salad here):  - Keg Cesar: RECOMMEND - Mixed Greens: RECOMMEND - Iceberg Wedge: RECOMMEND - Heirloom Tomato and Burrata: RECOMMEND  Casual Plates: - Cauliflower Steak: RECOMMEND -Tuna Tacos: RECOMMEND - Keg Burger: RECOMMEND  Steak and Prime Rib: - Bleu Cheese Filet: RECOMMEND  Cocktails:  - White Sangria: RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"The wait staff was amazing. Over the course of.the night, I got to know the management too. Every single person from when we walked in to when we left was beyond fantastic. Will come back and will recommend to everyone and anyone."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm always here lol. I love the keg!! Definitely my go to spot whenever I'm feeling for a chunk of delicious meat. I try to snap shots of my food but after the appetizers I sort of forget. By the time our steaks come I already dig in. I've had a couple good times at the keg followed by a couple of bad times. They have their hits and misses with the food being cold. But their garlic mash is to die for. They always have a daily special that they tell you as you are seated. And the servers are all so friendly!"}
{"text":"We were a party of six.  Arrived early, around 6:30 on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  Staff were very attentive, food was perfect.  Hubby and I shared a steak dinner and steak was cooked to perfection and tender.  Salad was split between us which was lovely.  Ordered an extra potato and it came the way we ordered.  Glass of Chardonnay was nicely chilled and creme br√ªl√©e delicious.  We were surprised to receive such wonderful service and food from a chain.  Kudos to the management.  We always share a steak, even at home, so we were happy that they could accommodate us this way.  We will return time an dime again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Thursday as part of a work event. I shared the lobster tacos and fried calamari as starters, and had fish & chips as my main.  All dishes were average. The lobster tacos are actually a lunch main containing 3 tacos - the lobster portion on my taco was about the size of a shrimp.   Service was friendly but I would have expected more from all 3 dishes for the price."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening. Was told the wait would be 50-60 minutes which ended up being 65 minutes. They had even run out of pagers so after taking our name down we were told to come back in 30 minutes to get one, then proceed to wait another 35 minutes for the table. This was a bit inconvenient.  When we were finally seated, our server, Jimmy, promptly came to serve us drinks and take our order. I ordered the 12 oz top sirloin with fries, to which Jimmy did a double take and had to read my order back to me to confirm that it was indeed correct. A 12 oz steak isn't all that big, and I easily finished it (it was perfectly cooked and very juicy, although not well seasoned. I had to add some additional salt and pepper), along with half an order of calamari (delicious!), and half a serving of bread and butter (so fresh).   The fries that originally came with my order were so overcooked and stale; shrivelled and cold. I asked for a new order of fries to which Jimmy happily obliged, and that was much appreciated. Had to eat my steak without fries while they were making a fresh batch. You can see a picture with my post of the difference between the two batches. Like night and day.   Since we were here for a special occasion, Jimmy kindly provided us with a complimentary slice of their Billy Miner Pie. It was a huge serving and plenty for two. It was very tasty but the bottom layer was a little too crumbly and just fell apart onto the plate when we were trying to eat it.   Brian ordered their burger with fries and was not impressed. Granted, it's a steakhouse, but if you're going to have a burger on the menu, make sure it's a decent burger. I had a bite and had to agree. It was well cooked and juicy, but very bland. There was no flavour to the burger despite the cheese and bacon. Quite disappointing, really.   Overall, a decent dining experience. The service was great, food was mostly good, but the wait was a bit long, and although the issues with the fries were corrected, I don't see how you can ever serve fries in that condition. That raises concerns to me about their quality control."}
{"text":"Service was great! Jordana our server was knowledgeable with wine pairings!  Food was exceptional! Price was good for the amount we ordered!  Left with a full tummy and a smile! See you next time!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night around 9pm. My boyfriend & I were craving a juicy steak for dinner so we ventured to the best place we know! The Keg!  Atmosphere: Warm, Intimate, Hip, Posh. Cleanliness: tables, chairs, cutlery and dishes, all very clean.  Constructive criticism: would love to see this busy place take reservations! Cuisine: protein packed! American influenced.  Facilities: very clean!  Food: To start, we shared the Baked Brie and a Cesar salad from our classic meals. We both ordered the Keg Classic 7oz Filet Mignon with a twice baked potato. My boyfriend ordered a lobster tail in addition. The steak was juicy, tender and very flavourful. The wrapped applewood smoked bacon on our Fillets was a big hit! The Lobster was tender and smooth.  Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: we come to the Keg all the time! It was recommended to us by steak lovers and we continue to recommend to friends and family. Hopefully our corporate functions will be carried out here soon too! Parking: sorry, not sure since we walked from our hotel (1 King West - about a 20min walk). Portion Sizes: 7oz steak looks small, but it's filling!  Price: steep. With alcoholic beverages, our bill came out to $126.00. We don't frequent here often, but it's so worth it!  Service: we waited 30 min for a table to open up. We were seated in the lounge since this was a faster option. We waited another 20min before our drink order was acknowledged. Our waitress apologized & the manager even came back and comped our Brie appetizer! (Thanks again guys!) Selection: not a huge variety, but just enough! It's like all the best items were summarized onto this great menu. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I was invited for a friend's birthday to the Keg. I have previously avoided it, thinking it is just a casual dining place, without much to recommend it.  We had a small group of about 8 and we all enjoyed it tremendously. We ordered nice generous drinks, and bunch of appetizers to share. I was not a super fan of the appetizers, but they were generally tasty particularly the dip.  But the highlight was  the steak!!!!! I ordered a baseball steak, 'pittsburgh style' which is charred on the outside and medium rare to rare on the inside. This is my favourite way of having steak.  After a relatively short wait my patience was rewarded with one of the best steaks I ever had. This includes such nice establishments, such as Moishe's, (Montreal), Gibby's (Montreal), Rib and Reef (Montreal..with the best wine selection in the province of Quebec), La Castille, Peter Luger (New York..and yes!), Ruth Chris' (New Orleans, Cancun), Morton's (Chicago), and all the steaks that you can taste in Dallas and Houston.  Now the cut of the baseball steak is a Sirloin, not a New York sirloin, and its a bit more chewy than let us say a rib steak or filet mignon...but what taste. And the steak cost around $25.00!  The reason I did not award this place 5 stars, is probably out of vestigial snobbery.  All kidding aside the appetizer are not quite up to scratch and the corporate ambiance leave a little to be desired. I don't know if the taste experience is repeatable either, as its hard to consistent in that kind of a soul-less corporate environment. But time will tell......"}
{"text":"BILLY MINER PIE makes my life, okay? Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds. With the 30 degree heat, this is a magical experience.   Somehow, I always feel like the service could be faster. I just want to eat in a decent amount of time - not having to wait 45 minutes to order because the server keeps disappearing :( Alas, this is a good location and I really like that damn pie."}
{"text":"Typically when I come to this resturaunt I order the French onion soup as my main course. It comes fresh out of the oven, and tastes quite good. I would highly recommend the teriyaki sirloin, as it also tastes quite good, and is a nice tender steak. The only reason I left out the fifth star is because when one of my family members ordered the \"supreme chicken breast\", it came out rather dry and over cooked. They did replace the meal and remove it from the bill, so I can't complain too much here. Nothing beats a free meal at a resturaunt, especially one with superior (as in more expennsive) prices compared to a lot of other establishments out there. I must say though, the second time around tasted quite better than the first, but it should have been done right in the first place for a restaurant that has high standards.  The overall meal was good, and I will be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the keg... you know what more enjoyable then just going to the keg, having someone ELSE PAY FOR IT! Heck yea!   Almost every time i've gone I get the same thing... I could branch out but like.... its steak.... i'm gonna get a steak... and if theres one particular type I enjoy, no need to change that. It's the Bleu Cheese Steak.... omg.... garlic and bleu cheesy crust over the top of this bad boy...ugggghhhhhh.... so good. And I always get the twice baked potato with it.   Service always great here, food always great dosnt matter what location I go to its always consistant. So I mean.... if you havent tried it yet, save up some money, or bug a rich friend :) and hit it up. Taste that is worth the coinage."}
{"text":"Came here today on a Sunday evening to enjoy a nice dinner which I haven't had in awhile.. Had a gift card to use and as I ain't much of a steak kind of person was a bit hesitant.. But I ordered the chicken dish.. Had the bacon wrapped supreme with asiago rice and ground asperagus.. And a glass of Jacobs Creek shiraz.. All I can say is that it was awesome.. Chicken was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside with lots a flavour..was a beautiful warm evening as well and ate outside which made it even better. Had the mini deserts creme Brule and mini brownie.. Loved it also.. Prices are a bit steep.. But the food is great.."}
{"text":"I've been away too long! I forgot how good the prime rib is at Kegs' in general.  I had been craving a Keg prime rib for a while and couldn't recall why. I used to make it a point to stop at a Keg in every city I travelled to on business or pleasure.  I think it might have been that the prime rib was always so consistently good.  But lately, maybe in the need to keep my Yelping varied, I looked past the Keg and chose another place that looked like a good opportunity for a review.  But this time, I returned to my favourite Keg Classic Prime Rib, impossibly tender, with that incredible flavour in the outside layer.  I have had prime rib at many restaurants, and it is always a bit of a crapshoot for flavour, tenderness and consistency, but this tasted exactly as I remembered it.  They didn't mess with the recipe after all these years!  The Classic includes a salad so my go-to is the Wedge salad, a quarter head of lettuce placed undisturbed on the plate and then mounded with blue cheese dressing, bacon, and chopped tomato. This ain't no dainty salad! The meal was also accompanied by a big scoop of mushrooms, sweet green beans and grilled red peppers.  And of course, a twice baked potato.  About desert--nope.  No room.  Billy Miner will need to wait for the next time..."}
{"text":"The Keg is a staple of the steakhouse world, especially in Canada.  It is unique in that it is not a high end chophouse, nor is it a Bonanza or Ponderosa budget steak house with the big salad bar.  The menu is a blend of steak and chicken dishes, punctuated by a bit of seafood, either as a main or an add-on.  I always default to the prime rib.  I don't think I have ever had bad prime rib at a Keg anywhere in the country.  This is not a Capital Grill, where instead of chopped bacon on the Wedge Salad , Capitol uses dice sized cubes of pork belly.  But it is not as expensive as the wedge at Cap Grill.  It's not like Ruth Chris', or Morton's, where the Ribeye  is an amazing cut of meat.  But the ribeye at the Keg is around half the price.  For me, a ribeye, wedge salad and a couple of sides at the Capitol grill will run me over $60 without beverages, the Keg will come in around $40.  Is there $20 of difference between the two? Absolutely!  Do I want to pay $60 each time I get a craving for some red meat? No.  Hello, Keg!"}
{"text":"Consistent prime rib-that's what I can expect from the Keg, and tonight was no different.  At a dinner function with a fixed menu, I'm glad that the prime rib was on the list of options, since that is the only dish I ever eat at the Keg.  The dinner started with the choice of Ceasar or garden salad, but I asked if it would be possible to sub the Wedge Salad, and they graciously made it happen.  The sourdough break kept flowing until the mains arrived.  Once again, the prime rib was just as expected, and I polished it off.    Desert included cheesecake and Billy Miner Pie.  I normally don't like ice cream based cakes, but I went for the Billy Miner.  I forgot that it was a good desert, not too sweet, and I polished that off too.  Then I regretted eating too much--a great end to the evening!"}
{"text":"After being to this location on several occasions I recognize this is a great place for casual dining with family as well for birthday celebrations. The staff are very friendly and very easily deal with her full house (given the popularity). I've also recently noticed that on the off time between 4 or 5 PM they offer a great service at the bar very friendly and it's a nice place to drop in. Please try the French Onion soup....before your perfect steak :)"}
{"text":"Pretty accommodating of vegan/vegetarian diets.  The California Salad is vegan subs mushrooms (maybe y'all can try asking for them to cook them in oil instead of butter)."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and I got the prime rib 10oz medium rare. It was fantastic...better than I expected. Our waiter was named Alex and he was very polite and helpful with food selections. We definitely had a great time there and we will be back."}
{"text":"During our 1 week vacation to the Toronto area, this was by far the best restaurant my husband and I ate at. The atmosphere was very nice. It was a little dark but there were candles which gave a beautiful ambiance. Our server was awesome. We came in wearing jeans and tee shirts (we didn't know when we left that we were going to decide to eat at such a nice place) and our server didn't treat us any differently than if we had been dressed to the nines.  It was a little pricey but the food was amazing. We each ordered a steak and lobster dinner and we were both in food heaven. All in all it was a really nice treat and definitely worth the little extra money. I would definitely recommend The Keg if you are looking for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about the Keg:  For a chain restaurant, it's fantastic. In my experience it's super consistent, the service is always incredibly friendly and accommodating, and it's the best bang for your buck you're going to find for a good steak.  No matter where I go, I know if I go to a Keg, I can order the same app and main that I've been ordering for 15 years and it's always going to be good.  I know the wait staff are going to know their wines, they are going to be friendly and attentive, and probably a little sassy.   I know for the quality and quantity of food I get, I'm never upset when I see the bill.   The wait times are crazy for a reason. It's a great place. And I hope it always will be."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to.  The service, ambiance, and quality and taste of the food are all 5/5!  Our waitress was incredibly attentive and friendly.  I was also surprised by the plentiful sizes of the portions (particularly the cheesy garlic bread).  We ordered the garlic bread and shrimp/lobster for our appetizer, and I ordered the steak with herbed butter with mashed potatoes as my entree.  I was very happy with the quality of the food as well as the presentation.  Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto.  If you are a steak person, you will LOVE this place. If you're not, there are many other options that are just as good.  Come here and make your belly happy!"}
{"text":"If The Keg had to be put into one word, it would be consistency.  I've yet to be really disappointed by any of The Kegs I've gone to.  For this chain, they sure know how to do steaks right.  This particular location is the closest to my parent's house, so we've had quite a few number of visits over the years.  Service is and always was wonderful, the staff are attentive and polite.  Though for this particular visit, it took us having to ask for the usual complimentary bread to be brought out, unlike other times where they would bring it out without us having to ask.  My usual orders are:  - 20oz Rib-in steak - the 10oz filet mignon - the prime rib (various sizes) - bacon wrapped scallops - the calamari - snail in mushroom caps  Each dish is delicious and delectable, guaranteed to satisfy any cravings!  Their steaks are cooked perfectly any way you like it to be. I usually order between rare and medium rare and have yet to be disappointed!  You can pretty much count on your steaks to be juicy and flavorful!    The filet mignon is particularly worth noting for being very tender rand juicy, it's amazing what they do with this cut at the Keg.  Also worth noting is the 20oz rib-in steak. It sounds like a lot of meat but when you're super hungry, this cut will fill you up and then some! Juicy and delicious!  Note that though the prices have gone up over the years.  Most items on the menu are $1 to $4 more than what they normally cost.  There's no explanation for it, though one would assume it's to keep up with inflation?   Their wine list is also pretty extensive and they have a decent selection of scotch and other spirits, enough to satisfy any alcoholics...like myself!   Whenever I want a great quality steak with reliable consistency and great tastes in the medium to high price range, I turn to the Keg.   It's not as poshy or decadent like Hyde's or Baberian's,  but it also won't hurt my wallet too much like those aforementioned steak houses."}
{"text":"We went to the Keg for our wedding anniversary. It has been a couple of years since we were last there. We both had the Steak & Lobster. The steak wasn't quite cooked the way I wanted it. We the waitress asked if everything was okay, I told her about the steak. A few minutes later the chef came to our table and offered to redo the steak. As we were almost finished, we declined his offer.  That is service."}
{"text":"It's official ......the Billy Miner Pie ice cream mocha cake is now cut into smaller portions :( And it's topped with a lot less almonds.  Still delicious of course. But not ideal for sharing anymore ....which is probably the idea now for The Keg to save/make more money."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at the keg with the phenomenal Billy Miner Pie and lattes!!  This mocha ice cream cake always blows me away as it is so delicious! We came last night just for the cake and lattes and it was great! I love how it's a huge slice for only $6!!!! And a latte is $4! Best of all, we got seated right in front of the fireplace!  Such a great date night, eating something delicious and being all cozy in front of the fire!  Thank you for being so great The Keg!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I moved to Connecticut about a year ago from the GTA. There are a number of things that I miss about canada - the keg is a huge one - or at least it was.   I have my go to - escargot for an app then keg sized prime rib - fully loaded bake potato. The things dreams are made of.   My app didn't show up until my entr√©e did. One app for a friend didn't show up at all. The prime rib was excellent but the potato that showed up was just plain. Not even cut open. They also seem to be skimping on the crispy onions too. Used to get a good pile - now it looks like they're trying to save money.   We went early knowing that this place gets stupid busy. At 5:30pm the service was so bad - I can't imagine it got better throughout the night.   I had to send a crown and diet back because the diet was flat. They replaced it but it was still flat.   This is a Canadian icon. A go to that is easy and predictable - but also expensive. I'm willing to pay the price for the typical keg experience - this was anything but that.   Just sad. Oh well."}
{"text":"It was my first time to the Keg. My friend with celiac invited me and told me all great things. The service was topnotch and as good as it gets. Prices are in the high side, but the quality was high up there. Twice baked potatoe was amazing and I ordered Manhatan Crab Mushroom which was also amazing. The mini creme Brulee was too small LOL... that's why they called it mini dessert. Overall very pleasant experience. Will come back on special occasions."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with my date , It's the keg  a chain so ambiance and decor was decent for a chain slight to above average upscale look . It was average busy in my opinion as we didn't have to wait for a table however there was quit a few people . The Service was mediocre at best !  Had to wait to be served when we finally did she took a while to bring us our drinks and then Take our order ..after ordering and getting our food her checking on us to get another drink was a little lost . Anyways ambiance of this place is decent  Prices are average for a steakhouse . Food is good  Service is a little poor . Maybe they will fix this ."}
{"text":"Deplorable service. Was not busy, seated at a table immediately. Then we just sat. Nobody came over. Our visit was short lived. We were there for over 20 minutes and not single waiter or waitress came over to our table.   For the record, we were a party of 2 and it was 9:41pm when were seated, on May 26th 2018. And we left at 10:04pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new location, which features possibly the best food I've ever eaten at a Keg. I ordered the saut√©ed mushroom supreme chicken and my boyfriend ordered a steak and both dishes were cooked perfectly and to our liking. Service was great too and even though there was a bit of a wait (it was a Saturday night after all) it was pretty prompt to get a seating for two. They quoted us at 40 mins but we maybe waited 15.   I also like the decor and the obscure art at this location. It really did have that King West vibe and it kept things visually interesting. There was one piece in particular, a backwards print that said \"Road Ends,\" that kept catching my eye. Our server told us the artist who painted it was inspired because that was the last thing he saw before he crashed his car. I don't know why, but I kept thinking about that for a while after.  This location feels very alive. There were a lot of groups of friends going out for dinner and drinks, and this kept the ambiance exciting. Overall, it maintains a pretty chill vibe even though everyone was beautifully dressed. If you can't make it east of Yonge to check out the mansion, the King West version also has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"have been to the Keg numerous times around the city.  This was our first time at this Aurora location.  We went on a Saturday night at their busiest peek.  I would like to explain why I gave it a 5 star.  The service at the front was extremely prompt and courteous, there must have been around 15 ppl waiting for a table, despite that everyone working the night shift looked like they really knew what they were doing, they were very well prepared for the rush.  We even managed to get asked if we wanted something from the bar, in our 35 minute wait we each enjoyed a glass off red wine, by the time we were seated we were ready to order, got some prompt bread at the table as well as another round of drinks, the bloody Cesar was excellent, had fresh celery and a pickled green bean which was quite delish.    I ordered the Sirloin Oscar Grilled top sirloin topped with shrimp, scallops, asparagus and B√©arnaise sauce. 8 oz and hubby ordered  Grilled Top Sirloin.  My Medium well was definitely undercooked but I didn't mind, so I traded with my hubby bc his was well done,  I couldn't chew it, he said that it wasn't because it was undercooked, we just got a bad cut.  Here is what made up for the bad piece of meat, the sides were excellent and the courteous service made it well worth the experience.  The manager came out and apologized despite us not even complaining, they actually noticed we didn't eat some of the meat and inquired if something was wrong.  They said that they would like to buy us some desert, so we went for it and ordered the trio sampler.  If someone offers you a free desert it would be rude to complain, but the creme Brule was expired and that was a shame because it is my absolute favorite deserts, plus again it was complimentary and it was so busy there was no way I was going to complain after the waiter and night manager were simply so polite! That is why I will give this place a 5 star despite the fact that the overall meal was about a 3."}
{"text":"Morons told us maximum of 30 minute wait and we are going on 90 minutes now. Completely unapologetic staff and a rude manager to boot.  This is the most pathetic Keg we have ever been to , other locations will bend over backwards to ensure a good experience but sadly this is not the case here"}
{"text":"Underrated chain, I actually have quite good success here on almost all my visits for a moderate price.  Quality of beef is nothing special but the \"chicago style\" steak is a nice feature to have in a lower-priced steakhouse."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to enjoy dinner at The Keg Steakhouse one evening last week. I just can't praise this restaurant enough, to begin with our server (Juan) was fantastic, kind, efficient and professional.  He made sure everything was delivered perfectly...salad plates were ice cold, dinner plates were hot!  Food preparation was excellent and again presented with style.  Kudos!  Look forward to returning.  And, I would ask for Juan!"}
{"text":"Going to The Keg is always a good way to spend date night! The food never disappoints and every time we go we always hope that we get to be served by Britney who does a phenomenal job.  I use to work for The Keg at this location many years ago and I wish to add that the cleanliness of the kitchen was immaculate. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've been stuck eating blah food for two weeks on a not so deserted island. That's deprived of any flavor and consisted of rice, beans, cucumber, avocado, and tomato.  On that note, the food here was amazing. Had the ceaser salad, double baked potato, and prime rib steak combo. Excellent flavor, cooked to perfection (what I asked for). Great horseradish and steak juice. Veggies complimented the steak well. Staff was friendly and helpful with the choices, drinks etc. I have to say I wish this was in the States. Second best thing to come out of Canada after Poutine. Oh man, if only they served poutine... but it's okay that was for dessert and just down the street.   Beer list could do some working, but it's canada."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times and it's always fine. I wouldn't normally choose a steak restaurant because I can make a decent steak at home but when we go it's always ok. One thing that I have to say is that I won't wait for 90 minutes for any restaurant, especially a 3 star restaurant. I haven't had a bad meal that I can remember not they are not usually particularly memorable."}
{"text":"Steak. Mm steak.   What can be said about The Keg Steakhouse & Bar that hasn't been?? Quite a bit.   First off location is great and serves SE Calgary.   Second service is one of the best in town.   The dining area is large at this location and occupies about 2/3 of the building with the remaining for the bar side (which does serve full menu).   Menu has changed looked wise but all the favourites still here including the Keg Classic dinners.   Escargot to calamari are great appetizers. Free bread as well.   The filet and NY Strip are my choices for entrees.   Dessert is great and the Billy Miner was delicious.   Overall great value for money and service is second to none. For all ages."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for prime rib.... Also found the mashed potatoes amazing!  The waitress we had was amazing! The food was amazing, I am amazed I'd go anywhere else...  Seriously.. An awesome dinner every time."}
{"text":"My partner and I celebrated our Anniversary at The Keg on King and the folks there were just amazing!  It was great service and to top it off they gave us a free slice of delicious ice cream mud pie almost too large to eat (with sparklers in it!) and a cute Happy Anniversary card.  Thanks for making it memorable. These guys deserve your business. The staff work very hard to make your experience the best."}
{"text":"Had an early birthday dinner, and had a really great server Amanda... She was so good I actually requested her when we celebrate my birthday next month with a part of 14. The place wasn't packed with the dinner crowd yet which was nice, the host was very friendly and as mentioned above, Amanda S. Was a great server, she was attentive but not obtrusive. I ordered the prime rib classic with a spinach salad with goat cheese as a starter. We also got escargot which was absolutely amazing...for such ugly looking things , they sure are delicious when combined with mustard and loads of butter! The prime rib was great at around medium rare... Happy I didn't ask for it to be grilled since I think that woulda overcooked it.  ever since discovering the twice baked potato it's always the way to go for me! Of Canyon Creek, Baton Rouge and The keg, I'm simple, give me a good ice cream cake ANY day ... And the Billy Miner pie sure fits the bill! Mocha ice cream with Oreo crust and topped w almonds... Definitely yummy!  Overall great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Matthew rocks! He was very friendly and attentive (maybe because it wasn't too busy) nonetheless his service was great. We ordered the peppercorn steak with double baked potato and steak & crab with baked potato. Food was also great! This restaurant never disappoints."}
{"text":"This Keg location is always quite busy, we went on a Sunday evening and weren't expecting to wait but the restaurant was very full when we went in. The hostess was courteous and let us know it was about a 20 minute wait, it ended up being shorter than that and we were quickly escorted to our table.  Our server was friendly and welcoming, she made sure we had everything we needed and that we were well taken care of during the evening.  We shared the garlic shrimp appetizer and both had the steak special of the evening that had a cajun seasoning with veggies on top of it. The food was cooked to our specifications, tasty and came out in a timely manner.   We've visited this located several times and the service is consistently strong."}
{"text":"I left here happy and bursting out of my pants!  We ordered a NY steak, Rib steak, the Oscar add on, side of asparagus and Mashed potatoes. For dessert; creme br√ªl√©e and the Billy Meyers cake.   The steaks were made PERFECTLY! the cut to each steak was juicy and flavorful. My favorite was the NY steak. The mashed potatoes complimented the steak with its creamy garlic flavor.   The Oscar scallops and shrimp was okay. It came in a small bowl with a side of sauce. The size of the shrimp and scallops were teeny. Probably about 5 of each in the bowl with a couple strings of asparagus. Would probably skip this next time.   I do suggest ordering off the dessert menu if you have room! The creme br√ªl√©e had the nice layer of Carmel sugar on top that you crack into. And if you're a coffee fan, the Billy Meyers cake is good choice!  The best part of the meal, was the price! I paid under $100 USD (including tip) for the whole meal. I couldn't believe it! I guess I'm so used to the astronomical prices in NYC.   A+ across the board!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this location is great. Loved it. One of my favs is the filet mignon. Great place for a special dinner! Good for group dinners... or even a date night!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience here. I prefer the lounge at this location as I find the dining area a little stuffy and cramped. The lounge also seems to move a little quicker.   I've never had a bad meal and the staff have always been more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Great location the food is fresh and taste great and good stuff and every time they improve the place and food so high recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"Best patio in Vaughan. Great selection of drinks and friendly service. Not to crazy about the menu.  Great place to go for drinks . Just find the menu needs a revamp to go with the atmosphere. 3 and a half stars."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to The Keg but when I got invited to celebrate a friend's birthday, I just had to go.  Everything that our group of eleven had, from cocktails to appetizers, entrees, and desserts, was very good. Our appetizers included Mushrooms Neptune, Scallops and Bacon, and Calamari. We ordered a wide range of entrees and everybody was more than pleased with their choices. My steak was cooked to medium rare perfection and very tender.  The birthday girl got a complimentary slice of The Keg's famous Billy Miner Pie (Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds) which we all got to taste. Excellent! We just had to order more. I also had a Creme Brulee that was delicious.  It's a good thing we went early because the lineup to get in was out the door the entire time were were there. This place was packed! Overall, the food was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We brought my nephew here for his bday dinner. The restaurant was clean and nice and they seemed to have plenty of staff. The staff were nice but made several errors in our meals. Hubby asked for his steak rare but it was medium rare...they offered to replace it but he didn't bother. My cauliflower steak was supposed to come with asparagus but they left the asparagus off. My son ordered a Pepsi that never arrived. In spite of these mistakes, everyone enjoyed their meals and they compensated us with a dessert and tea."}
{"text":"We came her with a group of colleagues as a good-bye lunch for my co-worker. It was OK overall, but there were  a few things I found weird.  The fresh bread they brought to the table was really good. It was still warm and after one piece I was wishing there was more.   I ordered my steak medium-rare, which usually means the center is pink. I cut into my steak and it was fully cooked--no pink/only very dark pink in some parts of the center. This looked more like medium to me. There were 7 of us who ordered steak, and three of us had our steaks cooked more well-done than we had asked for. I don't like those odds. That was a bummer.  Since they had overheard us saying that it was a goodbye party, the waitress brought over a big piece of ice cream cake for the man of the hour. The thing was that it took her so long he had already left to run to a meeting by the time she came to surprise us (we didn't know they were bringing it)! Since it was ice cream we couldn't take it back to the office with us, so we just ate it with who ever was still there. When the bill came they charged us for it!! Even though we didn't order it, and they had brought it over as a surprise! hahah this was so weird to me.   Anyway, it was nothing special overall and I wouldn't be diyng to go back"}
{"text":"Very Crowdy I had to eat at the bar because it was too crowdy and the waitress had a unfriendly attitude. I ordered the ribs and was quite satisfied. It was good but I felt it was too expensive, it is just a steak house not a gastronomic restaurant"}
{"text":"Visited again for a friends birthday. What was done right/wrong:  Right: * Our server Patrick was fantastic. Entertaining, efficient, knowledgeable, friendly  * New menu (only found at this particular location for now)..interesting items * Blackened steak was fantastic (thanks to the waiter for suggesting it)..cooked to perfection with a nice heat (flavour) to it * An error made with a side dish was rectified immediately  * Free slice of cake for birthday girl was unexpected * We recognized the girl who brought out our wine as the waitress who served us the last time we were here. She was fantastic...plus it speaks volumes that staff stay.  Wrong: * My favourite steak (pecan encrusted) was taken off the new menu. Disappointing as it's what I dreamt about when it was decided this is where we were going * Side dish mix-up. Ordered garlic mashed, got twice baked potato. It was fixed immediately. As a plus, they left the twice baked and it was off the charts good. * Birthday girls steak (ordered medium) was well done. It was sent back and another one delivered shortly thereafter  Will we go back? Definitely."}
{"text":"Love this meal.  Anna V was amazing and attentive.  Food was so good.  Slight mix up on the order but the way they handled it was fast and extremely professional.  I would recommend The Keg to anyone."}
{"text":"Staff here are nothing more than spiked high school kids. The women that were hired to greet, a collection of four high school seniors and juniors were incredibly rude and chose to ignore guests as opposed to helping them. There are other kegs that don't employ self important snobs."}
{"text":"After reviewing the Talk threads where someone recommended the Keg for steak, I knew that a visit to Cow-Town would not be complete without eating meat. And wow, they were so right!  I chose the New York Sirloin, which came as a complete meal. Starting with a wedge salad and blue cheese dressing (and blue cheese crumbles!), I cleared that plate. When the main arrived, it was a perfectly cooked medium rare and I think it might even have been a little overweight. Nicely charred on the outside and red warm in the center (see the picture), it included some grilled veggies too. The only bummer was that I was too stuffed from the salad (and a hunk of yummy bread) that half of it was wrapped up.  Trudy was a super server and did a fine job of taking care of me and my needs. Very friendly but not too much so.  This is a very \"manly\" restaurant with lots of dark wood and subdued lighting. I think it would be a perfect date night meal, if only Mrs. K. wasn't 2000 miles away while I'm here in Calgary for work. :-(  It's not cheap, but it is good. Well worth if for a splurge. No wifi."}
{"text":"I have to say I was very impressed with my most recent experience at The Keg!   I ordered \"The Keg Burger\" and was amazed at home much their quality has increased over the last time I had the burger. The meat wasn't dry or salty; something that I have experienced at other burger places. The bun was also nicely toasted and not overly crispy, or soft (if that makes sense). In summary I'd say it was the best burger I've ever had anywhere.   I also had a Mango Mojito to drink and was pleasantly surprised with that as well, the drink had a strong taste of alcohol, something I don't usually experience when I have mixed drinks from restaurants.   The service was also amazing and top notch considering how busy they were for a weeknight. Our server and the kitchen manager both came around to make sure we were satisfied with our meals, a nice touch since service at The Keg can be spotty at some times.   All in all, definitely give their burger a try if you're looking for a little more of a formal burger eating experience!"}
{"text":"This is our first time in this location and a convenient spot. The steak is juicy and delicious. Good for all meals.  and reasonable prices. Many dishes to choose from. The kid meal is a good combination and good value!  Highly Recommended. Very good! Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"It's been about 8 months since I last dined at The Keg.   We had amazing service throughout our entire visit which started as soon as we walked in. Me and my sister started off with the bacon wrapped scallops and later on had prime rib served with Keg fries. Everything was amazingly delicious! The prime rib was seasoned to perfection. Actually craving for some prime rib as I'm writing this *drools*.  The bill came up to about $100 before tip. Pretty pricey just for 2 but was definitely worth it. Can't wait until the next time I can have some more of their delicious and juicy prime rib!"}
{"text":"We went here for my brother's birthday party. The service was extremely slow that night. It was the same night as the Christmas Parade in Brampton so okay fine we waited an hour. After being seated we had to wait a good 45 mins additionally to get our food. That was very disappointing. Most of us liked our food and were satisfied however my mother's meat was not cooked properly and they gave her the option of sending it back and getting a new plate. The issue was that we'd already waited 2 hours to eat so that was not acceptable. They really should have offered her a free dessert or a free meal given the size of our party and the wait time but they didn't. Not very good management if you ask me. The manager did come out to speak with us but offered nothing other than a new plate. Waitress seemed stressed and unhappy. Be warned this restaurant was not really a family joint but more like somewhere you'd take a date or go for a party. Food was mostly good, good atmosphere but poor service, at least that night."}
{"text":"Dined at many Keg locations and this one was the most recent. Knowing about the rule of no reservations on Saturday evenings, we figured arriving at 8pm would be a good time. We waited for 10 mins and were seated in a cozy booth. Our server Christie, was fantastic. Very professional and friendly; I would hope to have her as a server again. Blackened Manhattan and filet mignon were cooked perfectly. A very positive experience here. My one suggestion would be that the hostesses and breadgirl (?) wear more appropriate attire. Their dresses were quite short and revealed a whole lot of leg. And thigh. And were low cut. Revealing more! Something I would expect at Moxies or Earls, but not at The Keg."}
{"text":"First off let me say, if I had a choice between here and Jacobs steakhouse next door, I would choose the keg. Reason being is because I think Jacobs is way over priced for what you are getting.  The Keg had a beautiful decor and atmosphere and the staff was on it!   As for the food:  Appetizers: the Caesar salad we had was really nothing special. The salad seemed like it had been tossed awhile ago and the dressing and flavor was not anything but average.  Shrimp cocktail, were ok, the shrimp tasted fine, but they had a fishy smell to them which slightly turned us off. We usually like extra horseradish and they brought us some but it was the creamy type not the fresh kind.   The main dishes we had were- Filet mignon with the baked potato , this was delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked to our desire and the baked potato fully loaded was so delicious. I wished the potato was bigger bc it was just so good! The baked salmon, another amazing dish we ordered. It was moist and delicious. The only complaint I had was that the rice pilaf that came with the salmon seemed a bit undercooked (meaning a bit hard).  We got a couple sides:   Mushrooms - these were ok, I have had better, but I'm a big fan of mushrooms so they were still tasty!   Brussels sprouts- these were delicious ! Loved these! They were packed with flavor, I just wished their sides were bigger   Dessert: we got the warm brownie! This was delicious! They knocked it out the park with this one. I usually like lava cake when I go to restaurants, but they didn't offer it, but this was definitely a good alternative.   Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my birthday. Recently it seems like the prices have gone up. My favorite item that used be the top sirloin and king crab has been taken out. Normally it used to be about 38 dollars or so. Now the steak alone was 33 and for king crab had to add $19.  On to the food. My steak was cooked well and tasted like something I would make at home. However my wife's filet was completely overdone. Took 35 mins to get new one which now was undercooked. The 3rd time around my wife was too full from grazing in our plates to enjoy her meal. My daughter's fries were probably made about an hour before we ordered them and they just threw them in. Had to return them as well to have it made fresh.  Overall didn't have a good experience at all and probably will not go to this location again. The kitchen has no idea what they're doing especially working with overpriced meat."}
{"text":"We had a great server when we went. Had the sirloin Oscar and it was fabulous! I love how there vegetables taste fresh. Great selection of meats don't hesitate to try it out!"}
{"text":"It's great to have a restaurant that you know you will get the best quality of food and service in my backyard.  I was here 6 months ago with gusts from out of town, Mark served us then, the food was fantastic, I had one of the best steaks ever. When we came back today, Mark remembered us and started the conversation from where we left it six months ago, 12 ez New York steak ones again, delicious, incredible."}
{"text":"I swear, I started to check my bill after my friend told me to stop placing my card down so fast without looking at my bill.   We go to the keg often. Always great food. Service is amazing, but more times than not I always get charged for an extra drink! Every time at the keg. Like 8/10 times. Bam extra drink added to my bill. Esp now since I am checking.   I wouldn't really understand why, but nonetheless it's annoying.  Just seems like a patten from this chain."}
{"text":"This review comes a week later than it should have. I was here with my brother and my mom and we were originally seated inside when we noticed there was a patio. How we missed it when we came I don't know. Lol. We asked the server if we could move and were told that it wouldn't be a problem. He was helpful and pleasant as he directed us outside. As soon as picked our table, we were immediately served. Marissa (I think that was her name) took our drink orders, and like the previous server, she was friendly and helpful in making suggestions for both drinks and food. Unlike at other restaurants she did come to check on us, asking when and if we were ready to order and once our food came ensuring that the food was to our liking. It was that right amount of checking in that makes you feel like your values as a customer bit they're not being intrusive. My mom ordered salmon, my brother had the filet mignon, and I ordered the steak oscar. While we waited for our mains we had their bread which is always delicious: warm, crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside with whipped butter...so good! The mains were just as delicious. We're family so we like to share. :) The salmon was perfect and while my brother and I both had steak, he had some of the shrimp and scallops that came with my dish. Everything was delicious, and the steak was perfect as were the veggies and seafood. The veggies were still crunchy and the seafood wasn't chewy or overcooked. I ordered my steak blue rare (yes folks, you read that right) and it was just the way I wanted it. We finished everything. Plates were clean when our server took them away and we decided that yes, we deserve some dessert. My mom and brother shared the creme brulee, while I ordered a serving or vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce since I'm not a fan of creme brulee. But it looked great and according to my bro and mom it was delicious. You can't really go wrong with vanilla cream and it was a nice way to finish dinner. Overall everything was great from service to food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I was roaming the streets of Toronto and we decided to give the keg a try. I was happy we ate there. The food was AMAZING!!! I Ordered a Top sirloin steak with garlic mashed potatoes, cesear salad, Butter bun and veggies on the side. The waitresses and waiters was so professional, fast, friendly, clean and well dressed. However, the restaurant was busy and for some reason I didn't feel uncomfortable or felt like I was squeezed in. I loved the decor and upscale style of this restaurant. I will definitely be going back despite how expensive it is."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8, in last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Definitely a weird experience anchored by really confusing service and hit and miss food. I'll just itemize some things we endured:  - we had two servers, one was decent, the other seemed to really not want to be there and could barely contain her contempt; - Food and drinks removed from the table when people weren't finished eating and drinking; - half-assed table maintenance so we were often holding used plates so they could put entrees down; - Some food orders not relayed to kitchen; - Requests ignored or only half completed; - Generally rude interactions - ie) constantly interrupting conversations; constantly reaching across people to grab plates and leaning over people's food with her hair practically brushing all the food and drinks; physically poking us to get our attention when we were eating or in conversation; - Spilling beer on me and then simply giving a cursory 'sorry' and walking away. A napkin would have been appreciated since our table had been completely cleared already, but it's ok I can air dry.   Food-wise our calamari was soggy and slimy, but they remade it. My steak was good - well cooked and well seasoned, so that's something.  The management comped a couple bottles of wine for us which was nice of them. Not sure what the deal was with our server last night, but this just shows how one person can really ruin an experience.   Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Visited this location on a Friday night around 8:30pm.  The atmosphere was live! A lot of young couples and friends dining in the bar area for appys/dinner/drinks. Our server, Jen M, was on point! She was laid back yet professional and made the experience a good one. So why 3 stars?   The Keg has always been 5/5 for me. They do steak and they do it right. Potatoes are something to crave and their seasonal menu is a hit. But on Friday night, this particular location may have been feeling a bit under the weather. Out of our 4 meals, two had items missing. My friends date didn't get her twice baked potato and I didn't get my Oscar topping. I let Jen know and honestly, it came out in seconds, only the scallops, shrimp and asparagus were luke warm. I'm not sure, maybe they sit precooked and lay atop the steak and the b√©arnaise sauce keeps it hot? Either way, I was really hoping they'd be cooked to order and would come sizzling. But they were just sad looking instead and just begged me to put them out of their misery. So I did without complaint and shoveled it back. Why send back my topping when the rest of my meal would cool? I just sucked it up and enjoyed the best I could. It was still good, don't get me wrong, just not up to my high Keg standards; know what I mean?  Regardless, I still tipped generously. It wasn't our servers fault and it was rectified right away. I'd probably give this location another shot but maybe on a weekday evening when there can be a bit more focus on substituted/altered meals. Otherwise, I'll stick to my ol' faithful Newmarket Yonge St location."}
{"text":"Going with a 3 star on this one.  Although the steak was excellent and my complaint was resolved to my satisfaction, I feel the situation was handled a bit unprofessionally.   Long story short, came here for dinner with some coworkers to celebrate a retirement. I ordered the teriyaki sirloin with a side of asparagus and a side of brussel sprouts. The asparagus was sad. Just plain ol' jane asparagus; steamed and flavourless so I added chimichurri sauce to them. The sprouts were good but the serving size was too small. In previous Keg experiences, the brussel sprouts have been generously portioned to which I don't mind paying extra for them. I explained how disappointed I was to our server who right away corrected the bill. I wanted to explain to him I don't normally make a fuss (thus why I'm on Yelp - passive aggressive) so I showed him a photo of my sprouts from another location. I wanted him to see the portions. He asked if he could take my phone to show his manager how the other locations are losing out on money.  I felt like a tattletale! Maybe this is my doing but I guess I thought portion sizing was across the board at all locations. Don't assume!   Anyway, I finished my meal with a bowl of vanilla ice cream and toasted almonds. Now that was incredible!  Would I return? Likely. If my friends were out and about and suggested here, I would probably tag along. If my friends asked me for a better suggestion, I'd stress a different location."}
{"text":"Went here this past week for my husbands birthday. They were incredibly accommodating for a restaurant that is not geared to having small children around. They have high chairs and boosters and an area where our small stroller with the infant could but brought in.   My 2 year old's food was ordered and arrived promptly while we checked out the yummy flat bread (pita with sauce,  cheese and balsamic vinaigrette). My prime rib was fantastic and at $27 it came with a large caesar salad 2 veggie sides and mashed potatoes....I couldn't finish it, but it was delish! The rest of the clan ordered the peppercorn new york and everyone's was cooked as they had requested.   Only downside was that we had to wait about 20 minutes past our reservation so that was a little bummer but really....its a very busy restaurant, what can you do."}
{"text":"Food Quality: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Parking: 5/5 Kitchen Speed: 5/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Value: 4/5  Ask to sit in Angie's area and you'll be in for a great meal.  Our drinks showed up quickly and were never empty and the tempura starter was great.  Not too much batter and the veggies weren't chewy.  The prime rib was perfectly done to order and the stuffed potato is a great twist on the old baked potato side.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our family goes to The Keg very often and for good reasons. They provide excellent service and the quality of their food is very high.   We were celebrating a birthday and ordered appetizers such as: calamari, French onion soup, Korean fried cauliflower. All of the appetizers were delicious.   They provide a fresh loaf of bread for the table which is an excellent pre appetizer to snack on.   We ordered the New York strip-loin, salmon, prime rib, steak and lobster tail.   One of our steaks had a piece of wire from the metal wire brush used to clean the grill. The server and manager offered their sincerest apologies and discounted the meal to free. This shows their strong customer service and for that reason we keep coming back."}
{"text":"It's The Keg.  You basically know what you're getting into.  Any given Friday/Saturday, there'll be a 45-50min wait if you come for dinner.  Can someone please tell me WHY??  I don't get it.  Service:  Always professional, polite, water refilled without asking.  I mean you are paying ~$50pp for dinner, apps/drinks included.  Setting:  Bustling, very dim.  Menu:  Quite limiting, esp. for dinner.  Vegetarians are basically screwed unless you just order a salad.  Your choices are limited to different cuts of steak, a coupla chicken dishes, or a fish dish.  That's it!  You can, however, choose the way you want your meat cooked, re:  raw, med, well done.  Calamari - Breaded, rather bland I found.  Dredge was NOT seasoned.  2 sauces saved it.  You had to use the sauce!  I also ordered some tenderloin medallions that came with 3 different types of sauces:  chimichurri (ok), peppercorn gravy (good), and another B√©chamel (not to my taste).  Mashed potatoes were well seasoned, came with peel, so I'm guessing it was not powdered!  :)  Again, not sure why there is a line-up for this place.  Novelty?  It's just alright for me, definitely not somewhere I'd go over and over again.  Tip:  Expect to wait if you come on the weekend.  It clears out just before 9pm.  They do not take reservations during this busy time, it's first come, first served!"}
{"text":"Really good restaurant! The sever was really nice, the food was really good!   The shrimp cocktail was fresh and sweet! The crab cake was crispy and full of texture.  The Manhattan cut was cook really well! Tender and juicy.    Over it was a telly good experience there"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend who has visited Toronto before, accompanied by a true Torontarian foodie, we went to the Keg on King!! The foodie - friend had not visited since their revamp.   We got nicely welcomed in a dim light, trendy yet comfortable bar. Dinner in the dining room had our preference. So we decided to enjoy cocktails while waiting for our table at the bar. Well made, good thought of, great presented cocktails.   At the table we were welcomed by Laura who turned out to be one of those \"I love my job sooooo much\" kinda hospitality tigers. She picked up on the jokes, made a few herself and made the evening amazingly nice.   The food was very nice, what you would expect from a steakhouse. Lobster gratinee... wow!!!! Cardiac Delight, but worth dying for. Crab cakes which actually consisted of 99%crab meat!!! The prime rib was cooked to perfection. And so was the NY strip my friend had. No more room for sweets, but what a pleasant surprise this encounter with the Keg was.   Out of 10 points? 9 for interior, 10 for the food and a fullblown 11 for the service (mostly earned by Laura)   A favorite new hangout!!"}
{"text":"Gord and I walked to the Keg for supper.  It opened in October 2014 and we've been wanting to check it out.  The restaurant was full so we sat in the lounge, which was jammed by the time we left.  Tori was our server and she started us off with some warm bread.  Yum!  Gord ordered the Seafood Chicken Deluxe with rice.  He said it was good and he'd order it again.  I ordered the 14 oz prime rib with mashed potatoes and it too was delicious.  I was given an end piece and it seemed huge ... sweet!  Yes, I'd get it again.  Tori was friendly and helpful.  Our only complaint is that the lounge was really really warm."}
{"text":"steaks are well executed and well priced. good friday night meal. i would definitely go for quality instead of quantity here (i.e. filet vs. new york strips)"}
{"text":"I am a pretty big fan of the Keg to start with, and this location didn't disappoint.  My only \"beef\" with the Keg is that they don't do reservations on Fridays and Saturdays, which is a huge pain in the ass when you have a group of 8 like we did. We were seated within a reasonable amount of time for a Friday (45 minutes).  In the 20-25 times I have eaten at a Keg, I have never been disappointed. Had a great 12oz teriyaki sirloin combo with shrimp and good to see Niagara wines on the menu."}
{"text":"I was traveling to Toronto on work, and normally steakhouses like The Keg are a bit out of my client's budget range, but I had an investment banking friend in town from New York City, so obviously I had to throw down so he thought I was successful.  The Keg is a solid steakhouse that actually doesn't punish your checking account or corporate card as much as some others might.  The atmosphere was refined, the steak was really well done (by well done...I mean medium rare), and our server was helpful in pointing us toward some good wine to pair.  I know they have a handful of locations around town, so pick one for a good time out to celebrate a special occasion or taking out clients.  Food: 4/5 Value: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"When going to The Keg you pretty much know what to expect. A quality steak...with slightly unadventurous sides. (Read: grilled peppers, asparagus, mashed potatoes etc).   But the service at this location is Phenomenal! My husband and I come here on a weekly basis because of the great servers! Colin is by far the best! If you go early enough on a Friday you should request his section!    Okay, back to the food. Over this past year we have had both the \"summer\" menu and the \"winter\" menu items. As I said, the steaks are consistently great! So I'll focus on other items.   Of note:   The tuna tartar.  AMAZING!  The chunks of tuna are not too large, and always taste properly chilled and fresh. The avocado they use as a base is also fresh and ripe, but doesn't have the \"overly ripe taste\" or the \"green but not ripe crunch\" that avocado can have. Somehow thy get it right consistently.   The baked Brie: excellent. Served with red pepper jelly and pesto. Tip: ask for the rpj and pesto in ramekins to keep them from spreading on the plate and mixing.   Garlic Bread: self explanatory.  But Delicious!    Mushrooms Neptune: very very rich. If you're ordering this as a starter it might be a good idea to get a salad with your meal to ease up the intensity.   Overall worth the trip and investment!"}
{"text":"Love the Keg, can never go wrong.  Any steak is great, especially the New York.  Baked potato is always yummy, as is the asparagus.  Love their Cesar salad  Great service and love their Pino.  Always a great dinner.  Yum!"}
{"text":"You can call me a basic bitch, but I do love me some Keg! I went here last month with a group of 10 friends for dinner and while we had a couple issues (some of the support staff have rage issues, no need to bark at us who ordered what please and some drinks took WAY too long to hit the table after being ordered), the food here is always reliable, the prices are so decent and honestly, you can't get better priced wine by the bottle or glass in any other restaurant of this calibre. Service was good, but unfortunately, 4 of the steaks ordered were cooked incorrectly, so they all had to be taken back. The manager came and apologized, and also comped all the meals that had been overcooked, which I thought was actually unnecessary. My friend even paid for hers anyway, so the server got a $70 tip from her alone that night..... I can't believe the desserts here are still priced so low either ($7). We ordered the Billy Miner Pie, Brownie, Creme Br√ªl√©e and Ice cream sundae, all DELICIOUS.  The decor at this location is sleek but also cozy, as they have a library-esque section with fireplaces throughout!"}
{"text":"Bravo Aurora keg bravo. Service was top-notch from beginning to end. A complete team effort from all the staff in the establishment. management should be extremely proud. My prime rib was the best I've ever had even comparing to every other keg. The unfortunate part is I don't live in the area to have it again any time soon. The only negative I always have with the keg is that there's seafood is way too salty and not great quality with the exception of the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Another Keg, another disappointment.  Nice location, good service, ordinary - and hugely overpriced - food. That's as usual, now to the specifics:  I tried a \"chicago\" style steak \"well-done\" inside, and got something worth $3 dollars in a cheap roadhouse resto somewhere in a Sao Paolo suburbs. Burned outside, wet in the middle, dry otherwise. Fail, guys, you just don't know how to prepare meat - many of the shawarma shacks here in Toronto do it better.  Compared to another Keg locations, though, even a normal \"restaurant\" food here in Mississauga was substandard, which is the reason I am giving this place only two stars. With reasonably good appetizers and sides even a lame steak might be bearable. Without them - no.  Sorry."}
{"text":"My memories of The Keg consist of waiting too long for chicken fingers when I was growing up in the suburbs, so when I was given gift cards I was...skeptical. My boyfriend and I had just given up red meat (which the giver of the cards couldn't possibly have known) but this place opened near my house so we gave it a shot.   I was very impressed. I think it was mostly the staff, who were all super capable, sweet, and accommodating, and the perfectly timed drink-apps-meal. Our meal was also delicious. The crab cakes: perfect. My salad was just OK. My boyfriend said \"this place is too expensive but...this is the best chicken I've ever had.\"  Entire thing: two glasses of wine, two pints of beer, crab cakes app, two (non beef) mains came to 111 before tip.   4.5 stars."}
{"text":"You're classic Keg, but in a great location with a late night menu. Food service available to last call. What more can you ask for in a Keg. So happy to have this addition."}
{"text":"It's standard Keg fare, doesn't disappoint and is pretty consistent. I would say that this location has a bit more of a pulse than some of the other ones I've been to and I enjoy the patio during the warmer weather.   What I like a lot is well, is that if you walk-in they're not upset (like a lot of other restaurants) and are pretty accommodating, the space is pretty large and its right in the club district that the table turnover is pretty high, which is great so that you're not waiting too long to eat..."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at this new location this past Saturday. Impossible to get a seat Or spot at the bar after 9 pm on a Saturday for whether it's for 2 or 6 women. It is a nice bar & obviously popular! we left since it was packed and went to bier market which was a few doors down and also packed but people were leaving so we were able to get a table for 6."}
{"text":"Went for valentine's day. They sat us in the upper level by the windows it was FREEZING!! The bread to start off was a 2 out of 10...hard enough to cut your gums on the outside but really soft and tasteless on inside. My meal was GREAT. Creme Brulee was so so."}
{"text":"All in all - great experience. Food was delivered in timely fashion, meat was cooked according to how we ordered. Medium well was medium well indeed. Seasoned properly, maybe a tad aggressive, but not unpleasantly so.  If I were to mention any issues - it would be cleanliness of tables on the patio, they looked like no one wiped them off from dust for a couple of days."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Keg for a few years now, but went to one recently for my fianc√©'s mother's 50th birthday celebration.  We had 2 long tables of people and I think three waiters assigned to us. We could ask any of them for drinks/etc, but each area our tables did have a specific staff assigned. Our waiter was fantastic! He brought me over a gluten free menu and made sure I knew exactly what I was ordering (the gfree menu didn't have the descriptions that the regular menu has) and was very prompt with our food and drinks. My fianc√© ordered a beer that was flat (end of the keg I think) and our waiter went to get him a new one - however my fianc√© was away from the table when he returned with the new beer. He actually returned it to the bar and brought a fresh beer over once my guy returned to the table! Crazy!  He kept the table well stocked with the free bread pre-dinner (no gfree options obvi - I wish!) and while he checked on us often, he didn't linger or keep asking you how the food is once you've taken a huge bite of steak and can't answer. All in all, the waiter made the experience amazing! I wish I remembered his name but I am just terrible at remembering any names!   The food itself: the garden salad was a giant half of iceberg lettuce. I guess I was for presentation, but eating my salad with a knife and fork was odd. The steak was good - couldn't finish it (I never can when I have even a salad for an appetizer) and it reheated surprisingly well! The sides were pretty great too. Drinks were MASSIVE. They are expensive (think $10) but I'd say you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"As a chain resto, you already know what to expect when you go to the keg. They're pretty good for consistency between restaurants. My husband ordered the lobster and steak. Pretty steep price tag at close to $50, and didn't even come with a salad. The lobster was literally half of an entire lobster ... Including the eye and those feeler thingies. He wasn't too happy because he had been imagining a lobster tail where all the meat is readily available. Regardless, he enjoyed it once it was taken apart, and his steak was good (as usual, can't go wrong with keg steak). I ordered the keg classic with an 8oz, a salad, loaded potato and added shrimp. They initially forgot to bring the shrimp so it was free. Bonus! I could barely finish half my meal it was so filling, but the steak was cooked to perfection. The shrimp was just okay. I think it would be better with some spicy-ness. It was more savoury.  Overall it was pretty standard for what you expect at the keg. Really good steak, everything else was decent and a somewhat hefty price tag."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Keg in Aurora and Richmond Hill for years and this is the first time in Newmarket. The top sirloin is best I have for years, on par with Ruth Chris and Auberge du Pommier. The waitress Meagan is wonderful. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! When I get good service, I tip very well and every waitress/waiter Ive had here have been nothing but amazing. I made sure they know how much I appreciate it."}
{"text":"We went to the keg last night to celebrate a birthday. Sadly I have to say last night's dinner's service was not stellar.  We were told our wait was going to be 40 minutes. In reality the wait was 2 hours. So they were not upfront with us on how long the wait was.  After waiting 45 min they told us another 45 min. I don't understand how they could have been off by so much time.   Our server was Lindsay and she not organized and seemed quite stressed and a bit impatient. She forgot to bring out a children's menu for us and we had to ask for it. She made a lot of assumptions last night without checking in with us as well.  The sour dough bread never arrived last night. We didn't have enough water glasses for everyone at the table. We had a child with us as we asked for water for him and it didn't come until we asked a second time.  We ran out of water and she had come back to the table and it didn't even register with her. We ended up flagging someone else down for water.  After she took our order for the appetizers (which were very good). She didn't follow up on ordering our meals until after the appetizers were done.   She got one of the meals wrong (blue cheese) on a salad that explicitly requested no blue cheese.   She tried to take away wine glasses without asking if we wanted wine and had proceeded to take away the wine list before we had a chance to select a wine and had to ask her to bring the wine list back.   Brought out the birthday cake without checking if anyone wanted coffee, tea, or dessert. By the end of the evening she seemed agitated with our table.   We didn't complain during the evening and we patiently hoped the service got better but it didn't. There were no offers on refill for coffees."}
{"text":"Always great!  I decided to try something new the lobster and shrimp salad. It was delicious. The lobster and shrimp were cold and ever so slightly bland but the flavours in the rest of the salad were outstanding.  Great wine too! The staff were super accommodating and helpful. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight.  Had to wait for a table at the bar, which is fine.  Service in the bar for drinks and appetizers was horrendous.  Soooo slow, painfully slow.  Seemed like they were staffed but disorganized and not into takin care of their clientele.    Anyways, after only one drink and trying to order more but without any luck, we left.  I did speak to the manager (Asian gentleman, forgot his name) and let him know what happens, and he was very courteous and genuinely concerned.  I am sure he would have made things right however my groups was fed up."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I'm usually not so critical but this place has really gone downhill. Full disclosure I'm a pescatarian (so only eat seafood). So maybe their steak dishes are good. Today I had their new tuna tacos and they were horrid!! It was like steak spice on tuna and the whole dish was completely subpar..did a chef even make this or was it thrown together with leftovers?? I RARELY return a dish - but did with this one. Gross and unedible."}
{"text":"I enjoy The Keg. It was a delight to enjoy a very, very late meal in the bar area. I had the sliders. I was not disappointed. The service was friendly and patient in the face of my hunger!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write this review as I have worked at The Keg and I know the extensive training that you go through to work there.   I have never been really fond of the food, it's a low end high priced steakhouse. My husband does enjoy it so I have my meal that I order and that hasn't changed in the past 10 years. I like the filet with garlic mashed potatoes. The meal was fine as usual, I won't go through the 10 others that are like eating shoe leather with fat and grisl.  This review is mainly about our server who had a really hard time acknowledging that my husband wasn't eating alone. Upon coming to our table for drink orders she first asked my husband what he would like. She was annoyed having to tell him what beers were on tap like we are there every day and we are testing her knowledge. I then asked what the chocolaty frozen drink is  that I have been ordering for years there. She tells me there's no such drink. So I order a chocolate martini, what a mistake. $12 and it tasted like water with chocolate sprinkles on top. She then completely ignores us and we are starving. After trying to get her attention for 20 minutes I finally make eye contact with another server and ask to get menus. Our server brings them to the table not asking if we want drink refills or appetizers. So now drinks are empty and we know our orders for dinner. She comes to the table after I stand up and flag her as she's walking by. Completely ignores me and says to my husband, what can I get for you. Him being raised properly says to me, you go first. I tell my order and then my husband tells his. She's very hurried and we have to pull her back to ask for a shrimp cocktail appetizer. Still haven't asked us if we would like any drink refills.  First rule of a server sell sell sell!!  Bread is brought to the table and right after the shrimp cocktail is served, no napkins, side plates or cutlery to be found anywhere. This is torture for us as we are starving. Two minutes later our salads are brought to the table and she asks why are we not eating. It wasn't a nice why, it was an extremely snarky why. We tell her we have no cutlery napkins or side plates. Without saying anything she walks away and comes back with the plates etc. The bread as always is good and fresh. Shrimp cocktail was a bit strange as it was the tiniest of cocktail sauce cups and the shrimp was to big to fit in it. Now the salad, it was the blandest salad we  ever had. The croutons had more flavour then the dressing and I'm not a fan of croutons. It was awful.   Now at this point three things happen that really shock me.   Our server comes up the the table and says you didn't tell me how you want your steak cooked. Well I wasn't asked either. And she calls me mamm!    I see anther server bring a chocolaty frozen drink to a table right beside us.   Our server comes back to the table and now asks my husband how he wants his steak cooked.  We laugh and say it must be her first job ever and her first night working.  Our food is brought out by another server who has to clear off our table before being able to put out our food down. I then explain that I ordered garlic mashed potatoes not the double baked and she says that she will take it back to the kitchen and correct the order. No problem , easy enough of a fix. As she turns to walk away our server comes to the table and snaps at me saying what's the problem here. Thankfully the other server explains cause at this point I'm really getting mad about  her tone and lack of social skills. My plate is quickly returned to the table, the steak and veggies are cold and the potatoes are to hot to eat. The steak was well done and I ordered it medium rare. I don't even care, it's a filet mignon, you could cook it for three hours and it would still be tender. I did notice that my husbands plate had a huge pile of mushrooms with peppers and green beans where mine had six green beans and two peppers.  We are not even finished when our server asks us if we would like dessert. We decline as we had already talked about going elsewhere for coffee and dessert due to her poor attitude. Soon as our forks are put down the table is cleared and she puts the bill directly in front of me, not kinda halfway on my side of the table but directly in front of me as you would put a plate. The look on my husbands face cracked me up and I slid the bill over to him. Not leaving the table the server stands there with the credit card machine in hand waiting for us to pay."}
{"text":"Always better than decent.   This time was a bit different. We had a pretty talkative waiter (not in a good way). Spewed out every single special and item that's on the speciality menu. (Which weren't steaks...)  Both of our steaks came out poorly. My whole dish was burnt. Check the photos. Steak was cooked too much and everything had a decent char on it.  My wife's steak was totally underdone.  Asked for medium, came out totally rare.   This was a first. The disappointing part was that the waiter and manager didn't really manage the situation properly.   They re cooked the steak but never checked to see if it was OK. Just odd. Lack of care unfortunately.   Now with that being said, the place is still better than decent. Usually the service is great and good is OK.   Beware, no reservations on weekends and it does get quite busy."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend at 11:45ish. Disappointed that baked potatoes were not available for an hour. I ordered the prime rib, cooked medium. The meat was bone dry. It came with au jus, which helped a bit, but I still found the meat difficult to swallow. The waitress was very friendly and quick. I didn't bother sending the food back, but will not likely return."}
{"text":"My to go to place, Always perfectly cooked Always awesome service  Great staff  Always a pleasure to dine there"}
{"text":"I've never been to this location before, mostly because I can never find parking. The minute that we got to the Keg, my bf found parking right away and the wait was only 55 - 65 minutes and it was also valentine's day. The place was packed. It honestly didn't feel like an hour wait. They were pretty quick in seating everyone.   On Valentine's day, they had a pre-fixed menu but we ordered from the dinner menu instead. My bf got a beer, ordered the cheesy bread and the peppercorn steak. I ordered a red wine and the 6oz top sirloin with garlic mash.   The cheesy bread was delicious, it was piping hot but too greasy from all that butter. It was so yummy but kinda worth it.   My bf loved his peppercorn steak, he fed me a piece and it was okay. I loved my steak and mash potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare and still juicy.   After finishing our entrees, we shared the chocolate brownie. It was delicious. The service here was amazing, our server was extremely friendly. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I heard so many bad reviews about the Keg in Newmarket but I had to disagree. The service here was absolutely amazing. We had a huge party and the two servers catered to each and every one of us. The servers were AMAZING.   The food was also delicious. Our dinner party was a late dinner and I already had an earlier lunch so decided to grab the iceberg lettuce since it was light and a side of twice baked potatoe. I should have not ordered the iceberg lettuce. It was just a wedge smothered with dressing. It was alright but I would not order it again. The twice baked potato was amazing and their red sangria was delicious as well.  The host ordered a bunch of apps and we got to try new things. I'm a huge fan of the tuna tartare, which I will be ordering from now on. It was sooooo goood. The calamari was also great with the sauces on the side and the portions were huge!"}
{"text":"Your typical Keg steakhouse and bar.  Must be pretty new, clean and decor is nice. It was PACKED for a Tuesday night, so this must be the happening spot in Aurora. We sat at the bar while we waited about 10 min for a table.  The barmistress had to use the cheat-book to figure how to make a Sidecar, and unfortunately was a bit overly sour.  Service was fine though, and so was the quality of the food, but overall it is your typical Keg, so if you're used to Kegs, this will probably be no different."}
{"text":"this was the WORST service i've ever had at the keg! but i will say it's only at this location - i've always had great experiences at other locations. i went for dinner. it wasn't too busy out on the patio, so sat out there with my companion. we were just told first come first serve (not seated by hostess), so we just chose a table ourselves. there was a group who sat down beside us and they were given menus right away. after a while, we finally had to ask someone for menus (uh, shouldn't have to ask). finally the actual waitress came, so we ordered an appetizer; the appetizer was served by kitchen staff (i think, he was wearing a different uniform) at the wrong table, then to us. no bread came, so we had to ask for that (shouldn't have to ask for that either!), even though the table right beside us with the same waitress got theirs without asking. similar issues with the salad and entree - went to wrong table first, then to us. took a looong time to get the waitress' attention for anything (drinks, check, etc), even though it wasn't that busy out on the patio (as i mentioned), and there were empty tables. and it definitely didn't make sense that the table next to us was getting better service with the same waitress. not trying to rant, i'm just saying i have never had such terrible service at the keg! - the only reason i'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 is because the food was good. but service-wise, this location was TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Fantastic opening night!  My compliments to the staff ... and of course my fun group of friends who made it such a good time.  Stellar service.  Flexible to accommodate our group of 8 over several hours of apps, drinks, steak and dessert.  Great vibe on the bar side.    King West needed this.  King West deserved this. Now officially one of the nicest patios in this hood.  I'm already missing it as the Canadian autumn is quickly turning to winter :/.  The 'flow' of this location, compared to many other Kegs I also frequent and enjoy, is much smoother ... and I'd even say 'welcoming'.  The transition from bar side to dining area, with private rooms mixed throughout, is just the right formula of your own large/private table but able to view and feel the vibe of the entire place.    mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmm steak. Out."}
{"text":"Go to date spot !! Staff is amazing food is amazing and the escargot is the most amazing thing i have ever put into my mouth any time someone even mentions it we find ourselves headed in within days for our fill. Only downside is no reservations on weekends it unfortunatly has left us unable to attend in large parties as the wait is not something we want to gamble with and have also given it a skip on occasion"}
{"text":"I came here a while ago with some friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious, and the service was also great! Our waiter took time to explain everything and he was very informative to my friends. We didn't have to wait very long for the food, and when it came, I was not disappointed! I love their escargot recipe. They have small mushroom caps over the snail, and pour a sauce over it. Delicious! Their creme br√ªl√©e was also pretty good. Not the best I've tasted, but it was still delicious! I My only small complaint is that sometimes the people who brought our food rushed is or acted a little annoyed. Not the best service, but not bad either. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Not all kegs are created but this one should be close to the top. I came on a weekend at 3 and was surprised by the steady traffic coming in. Was it the early bird special?? So I started with the mushroom Neptune.  The mixture of creaminess and the crab was delicious.   the steak was not overcooked.  I hate overcooked steak.  And the twice baked potato was twice as hood.  Like the terminator I will be back."}
{"text":"I accidentally made a reservation at The Keg on York instead of King, but this location was quick to accommodate us on a busy day in spite of my error. Our waitress was great. The manager checked in on our table and upon finding out my parents had come from out-of-town, sent over a free dessert that was very much appreciated. Most importantly, every part of the meal was spectacular.  This Keg location is especially consistent in delivering a great restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the steak as it was cooked to perfection!!!! The super friendly staff provide great service that completes an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"It was my first full day in Mississauga as a Vancouver-based lady out on a business trip. Friendly hosts, attentive waiter (who accommodated my gluten-free and dairy-free needs) and an upbeat environment made my stay enjoyable. I left my vegan diet in the West Coast to use my trip as an opportunity to really enjoy myself. There were about 35 of us there; but the staff handled everything well. For a Tuesday night, it was bustling.  The wedge salad dressing options had dairy in them. I asked our waiter if there was a non-dairy vinaigrette available and he said yes, delivered. Asked for my steak medium rare with fries, delivered. Asked for my monte cristo coffee with no whipped cream, delivered.   Asked for matches at the front hosting desk, delivered. I went back, asked for a second box, delivered.  Restaurant had great ambiance and restrooms were neat and tidy."}
{"text":"Beautiful modern restaurant with great service and food. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"The Keg is my #1 date choice.  Their food and service never disappoints. My favorite is the steak Oscar which is amazing.  Usually we don't have a huge like when we go but I would always suggest calling ahead to see how busy they are since they don't take reservations on the busiest nights."}
{"text":"I went to this Keg for a work lunch around Christmastime.  The starters were delicious, we had both MUSHROOMS NEPTUNE (mushroom caps, crab, cream cheese), and SCALLOPS & BACON (scallops wrapped in smoked bacon with a cocktail sauce), but the main was disappointing. I have had prime rib with mashed potatoes at the Keg before and it was good, but I was trying to be healthy and there isn't much in the way of veggies on offer. So I ordered the prime rib with asparagus and everything was just bland. Meat not seasoned, plain steamed asparagus not seasoned, and the horseradish was so strong it nearly killed me, I thought I was going to black out after one little dollop. So if you are going to get the prime rib, get it with the mashed potatoes. Everything is like every other Keg, dim lighting,communal parking lot (free), full bar. Service was good, my meat was a bit more rare than I ordered and somebody else's came more well-done than they requested, but overall it was fine."}
{"text":"Great Experience. First visit to this location. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and you can never go wrong with the keg. We were greated by a very friendly hostess and brought to a nice private booth immediately and she asked us if we were celebrating anything and let us know our server would be right over. Our server was very pleasant and congratulated us on our anniversary. We started out with a glass of wine and shared some appetizers and there timing was amazing. Was a nice break between apps and main course. Steaks cooked to perfection. Only complaint would be the green beans were not cooked at all..At the end of our meal our server supprised us with complementary cheesecake and a  nice card! .Very nice gesture. Definitely would return again when in town."}
{"text":"Wow!! I was blown away from the phenomenal service I received at The Keg on a busy Friday night. I wish I remembered our waiters name because he was great! Constantly refilling our waters, great recommendations, thorough explanation of the menu and to end off the night a complimentary dessert!   I decided on the 7oz filet classic keg entree. This came with a choice of side dish, choice of salad and vegetables for a fair price of $39. A good thing to know is you can select any of the salads on the left hand side of the menu; I opted for a spinach salad with goat cheese which was a surprisingly large portion.  I asked for my meat to be cooked medium and found it to be on the medium well side, a little too tough for a filet.  The bar was not set too high for this location after reading other yelps reviews. The steak was slightly disappointing but the service far surpassed my expectations. Our waiter deserves the 4.5 stars for that alone.   Side note: no reservations on the weekend. The restaurant is huge but fills up pretty quickly around 7pm."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was wonderful if a bit salty. The other steaks were awful. Rubbery. Not impressed considering the price paid."}
{"text":"Food was AWESOME.  Wine selection as aight.  Overall, great value. Glad it's open late.    Portions were good and we wouldn't hesitate to get any of the same items again.    Appetizers:  Baked Brie & Escargot Salad:  Caesar Mains:  Filet & Lobster Tail Sides:  Asparagus & Baked Potato Desserts:  Billy Miner Pie & Brownie Sundae"}
{"text":"I only and ever order the cheesy bread toast which I recommend if you are a cheese lover such as myself because of its perfect crunch and chewyness of the baguette and seasoning they put on it is like crack however sometimes it's a bit salty. I would also recommend getting anything with their super creamy mash potatoes!!! And a side of their saut√©ed baby mushrooms."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their steaks and the million miner cake!! Generally speaking, for the price I'm paying, the steak is a good size and it's cooked just the way I like it - medium rare. If you want some cr√®me glaze and scallops, I also recommend the sirloin Oscar because that steak is topped with scallops, shrimp and cream sauce. Yummy! I always end my meal with the million miner cake. It's a mocha ice cream and chocolate cookie crumb crust.   Last tip?  If you're in Mississauga, the heartland location is one that opens for lunch. The Argentia location is not open during lunch time. If you tell them it's your birthday, they give you a complimentary slice of the million miner cake!"}
{"text":"If overpriced okish steak is your thing, then definitely give it a shot! The atmosphere is good, but for all the marketing efforts they could tey to do a better job with theirs steak. All in all you will get a good jaw work out and your date will be impressed on how much money you just dropped on this date. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Steak done Chicago style has opened my eyes to the huge slab of meat also known as The Steak. The service here at the Newmarket location was good mid-service to the end of the meal, but was a bit sloppy at times by forgetting our bread, waters, and mini plates at the beginning. A mix up happened when we showed up for my reservations where the host seated us in a totally different section than the other two members of my party, so each half of the party was waiting for the other half to show up for like 10-15 minutes before a waitstaff came in and said \"i'm not sure, but i'm almost positive that the other members of your party are sitting SOMEWHERE in the restaurant\" and then just walked away. Well thanks for the information Waiter, an exact location would have been useful information to provide. We walked around like total idiots looking for our guests, and then when we finally found them, had to fetch our drinks and coats etc from the original table. Not impressed by the mix up but I don't assume that stuff happens all the time, so i won't hold it against them. the food was quite good, and everyone enjoyed their meals. the portion sizes are good and the food was fresh and cooked well: veggies weren't soggy, very flavourful, not overly salty. the atmosphere is comfortable and something that anyone would enjoy. I shared the Billy Miner pie and the double baked potato for the first time based on the comments of other Yelpers and i wasn't disappointed, delicious! Lastly, i'll end this review where i started, Chicago style steak FTW."}
{"text":"The Billy Miner Pie is the best damn pie ever! I would want to keep this in my freezer and eat a slice every single night. I'm never disappointed by it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and have yet to leave a review. The Keg has become a bit of an annual tradition for my boyfriend and I when celebrating our anniversary. Given how much of a sucker we are for steak, it's completely appropriate. This place has the tendency to become ram packed very quickly on any given night, so it's advisable to make a reservation. (Note: They don't take reservations Friday - Sunday, don't ask.)  Luckily for us, our four year anniversary landed on a Thursday, so we were in business. We ended up arriving 10-15 minutes late do to heavy rain and poor visibility thanks to heavy brume, and I was a bit apprehensive due to the number of people queuing for a table alone that they might have let go of our reservation. Thankfully, that wasn't the case and we were quickly seated much to the chagrin of those waiting for a table.   When we were seated, we noticed the plates on the table were still showing some food residue, so we promptly asked for a new set, which the waiter was happy to oblige.   Once he returned, we put in our order: Mushroom Neptune, Baked Brie, Peppercorn Steak and a Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon.   We're sort of accustomed to the long wait times associated with attending dinner at The Keg, so you can imagine our surprise when 10-15 minutes later, our appetizers were in front of us. With our meals quickly following suit 10 minutes after that. The baked brie is a must for cheese lovers. I'm not normally a fan of brie on its own, but something about it being baked and slathering pesto or red pepper jelly on top of it makes it a truly divine experience. The Mushroom Neptune on the other hand, wasn't for me - no fault of The Keg's, but just not palatable to me. You can mask a mushroom with cheese and crabmeat all day long, and it's still a rubbery mushroom. This worked to my boyfriend's favour as this is pretty much the only time and way he'll eat mushrooms - more for him!  The peppercorn steak carries just the amount of kick to it and melts in your mouth. Coupled with the twice baked potato (an absolute must as your accompaniment), your taste buds will be on an unreal trajectory.   All in all, this is probably the most memorable experience we've had at The Keg in awhile and we're looking forward to next year!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. The high back seats give the feeling of privacy and intimacy. The food is perfectly delicious. They ran out of Asiago rice that night but the manager gave us a complimentary side order. It's a great place to wine and dine with family and friends."}
{"text":"It's the Keg - what more is there to say? Decent service and good steak, this location is no different.   Things to note: - Ask for the Bearnaise sauce on the side, else you'll find your steak drenched in it - Mash potato lovers - not sure how you like it but it's chunky and there's potato skins in theirs (personally I prefer the fluffy soft mash) - Not a good location for those with limited mobility, a couple of steps throughout the restaurant (had to walk up and down and up again just to get to my table lol so unnecessary)  However, you MUST get the Billy Miner Pie before you leave. Ugh sooooo good and great portion size too. I would actually just go to to the Keg just for this dessert."}
{"text":"Always a great time and good food. Service is usually good, food is even better. Steak was cooked well, amazing double baked potato, and don't get me started on the bread they bring you before you eat. It's almost to die for. Will be going back there for sure."}
{"text":"Date night? Celebrating your promotion with your parents? Girls night? Safe bet is the Keg.   I have been here a couple of times and it's aight. It's a very classic and traditional steak restaurant and it's not too exciting. Service has always been good here and the waiters work hard. That being said, weekends and holidays are the biggest b word ever. Expect an hour wait at LEAST. This place gets packed easily and it's craaaazy. The venue is huge too and it's not super spacious between tables, so it feels like sardines in a can.   The steak is good. It's nothing to write home about but what really puts me off sometimes is I order a $40-50 steak and they literally give me 3 beans and 1 red pepper slice. Not even joking. After a bacon wrapped anything I would like to at least pretend I am healthy!  I give the Keg a 3.5. The experience is good and classic, but they are lacking excitement and the portions are whack."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service is good....food...not so much.  They are known for their steaks and mine was not edible!  My steak very tough to chew and my boyfriend's steak was overpowered by the peppercorn sauce.  He ate his but I sent mine back and ordered an appetizer instead.  The manager came over, apologized and did not charge for my meal, even though I ate the side.  He also did not charge for my appetizer."}
{"text":"Great food, lively atmosphere, and close to home!  Good place for a date night or a Family dinner out!"}
{"text":"It is the season for holiday dinners and I was lucky enough to be taken to this particular Keg Steakhouse by a client as a treat and a thank-you for our business.  We ordered a round of drinks all of which came exactly as ordered and in good time.  We also ordered some appetizers.  I ordered the Calamari, which came in quite fried and hard and not soft and tender as you would expect to get it at a fine dining restaurant.  The bread that came to our table, although tasty did not look to be fresh.  All this aside I decided to order the Filet Mignon with Lobster Tail and a side of mash potatoes.  I usually order the same meal and use it as somewhat of a staple to find the best Keg location and avoid those other ones that do not seem to prepare the foods as well as I would expect.    The lobster tail came in a little on the cold side and as such lost a little bit of its flavour and appetizing texture.  The filet mignon came wrapped in bacon and looked quite appealing. The steak was cooked to a medium--medium-rare texture and was quite delicious as I ate about half of it, until I cut a piece, put it in my mouth and discovered a large toothpick, which scraped the roof of my mouth.  As soon as this  happened I lost all appetite.  It took approximately 5 minutes of my waiting, not eating, until I actually waved our waiter down and explained to him the situation.  He apologized and proceeded to explain to me that it was likely the pick that they use to attach the bacon to the filet mignon during cooking. I had already inferred this to be the case.    Unfortunately for me, about 1 inch worth of it was still within my food.  I was told that the manager would come to speak to me.  Considering the severity of the situation I thought a manager would be approaching me within 1 to 2 minutes but it was still a wait much longer than expected.  As the manager approached me she apologized for the situation and said that they would cook me a new one.  She quickly switched topics and it felt to me that the apology was much more of a \"standard protocol\" than a heartfelt apology for a situation that could have gone a lot worse had I stabbed the roof of my mouth with this pick.  I waited for the new meal, which never came, and ultimately the person that had invited me (and others) to this meal received a discount on the bill.  This person was kind enough to request to have the discount removed and to provide me with a gift card instead.  With some hesitation it was done so.    I have been to this location before but had never experienced such lack of professionalism.  I like the steaks at the Keg, but this experience has definitely changed my opinion of this particular location and I will likely not be attending it again.  Quite a disappointment on the food side of things but it is still quite nice to have spend this holiday dinner with the people that were there with me."}
{"text":"I am always happy with the prime rib here. Service is really friendly. Get the cheesy butter. Trust me! Your welcome!"}
{"text":"Came for late night snacks and drinks after having difficulty finding anywhere on King st. not completely packed with party type people and loud music. Nice ambience and good service. Will surely come back."}
{"text":"The steaks were all well presented on the plate, very tasty, cooked correctly, and the service was fantastic!    I tried the 8oz Top Sirloin with the twice baked potato.  This was more than enough, but since I am a French Onion Soup Junky, I had to try It!  Unfortunately,  it was only average, with a pungent after taste every so often.     Having average French Onion soup for a steak house and no unsweetened Ice Tea available, (if a customer asks for something not on the menu, the waiter or waitress should within reason always try to satisfy their customers request) automatically prevents a five star rating.   All in all for the price this place was pretty good.   I enjoyed the darker lighting very suitable for a steak house.   You should dress at least business casual, to blend with the rest of this restaurants patrons."}
{"text":"I have to travel quite a bit for work. Stumbled on The Keg last night through checking Yelp and boy was it amazing. Walking in there was a long wait but 2 seats were available for my coworker and I at the bar. The bartenders were great and very knowledgable about the menu and really seemed to love their jobs. The meals were incredible and with that I will be returning for more."}
{"text":"We were here, yet again for a special occasion and they made it even more special by remembering it and by making a sweet surprise for us. Every single time, I enjoy their customer service and food. If I could, I would give this location an extra star...just for consistent good service and food."}
{"text":"It used to be really good. But on my last visit the steak was really poorly cooked. We arrived at 1:00pm, steak was not served until 2:30. It is the holiday season stop trying to save a buck and hire enough staff. Anyway I recommend the keg on airport road as this one is horrendous."}
{"text":"This place has the best patio on King West for people watching. The ambiance is quite good and the staff is friendly. The food is overall very tasty, but I really wish they have sweet potato fries and more/greener salad options. It's a chain so it's good as it gets...."}
{"text":"Top notch customer service - 100% perfect service from Holly!  Had the Keg Classic Filet Mignon, always a meal to perfection at this location!  My Mom and Bro really enjoyed their meals too! Not a single flaw in our experience :D"}
{"text":"Although the Keg is a chain, and we all know what to expect food/drink wise, I'm actually glad this staple restaurant has been added to King west. It has a great bar set-up, where you can go in to enjoy watching a sportscast, with lots of room to sit around the bar, with a great group of 'young professionals' either there for the evening or just stopping by for a drink. That being said, they could always add a little more as it gets busy. The patio is also large, which is great considering how all patios in King west can be. They also have great prices on bottled wine, which surprised me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with fast table service in a timely manner.  Had the calamari, escargot and delicious sour dough bread.  We enjoyed the surf n turf  with New York cuts. Delicious n well aged as usual.  Ps.  Server , Kathy was terrific. MGR forgot birthday cake but when she found out after bill was completed, she brought out an ice cream bowl with a sparkler."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite kegs.  Always friendly staff and consistent great steaks. Aged well, tender, succulent and juicy.  Lobster tails, calamari, twice baked potato, baked salmon and bread never a disappointment. Our teenagers crave the aromas and comfortable dinning chairs."}
{"text":"After a a lot of underwhelming dining on our first trip to Toronto, I stopped using people's recommendations and turned to Yelp. Found this spot, and thank god. I was starting to lose hope in the entire country of Canada.   Went with 3 coworkers, service was prompt and really nice. We got a bottle of prosecco, the ahi appetizer and two salads to start. Everything was amazing. Everyone else got steaks, I ordered the salmon. It was a HUGE portion of fish, the mashed potatoes were perfect and I'm kind of obsessed with the Brussel sprouts. The sauce on it was so good. Everyone else seemed very pleased with their meals as well. I wish I remembered our servers name to give him kudos because it was the best service we had our entire trip. Tall guy. Thanks!!!! Lastly we got dessert- a huge piece of birthday ice cream cake, and creme br√ªl√©e. YUM!"}
{"text":"5* plus plus service! This place is busy and when we come we usually like to go to the bar. Staff are exceptional, professionals, extremely friendly and know how to make the experience right.  My hubby likes steak and I want the fish so great place to please both of us.  We will definitely be back as food and experience is always consistently great!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy place!  My favourite area is bar lounge to eat but it wasn't in the cards for a Friday night.  We put our name in to wait for a table, hostess said it soils be an hour however it was only 30 minutes.  We went to bar to have a drink and staff at the bar are uber crazy and exceptionally good at what they do.  By the time we found a table at bar, ordered drinks, our table was ready.  Our bar waitress sat us at dining table and when we said we would prefer table near fire place as current table was too tight she gladly did this for us.  She was 5* plus in service and friendliness.  Our dinner waiter seemed overwhelmed but made sense as it was a crazy night. We started with the baked Brie, calamari and shrimp cocktails.  The baked Brie roasts were burnt so when we said something to waiter they sent new toasts over and waived the fee of that appetizer.  The steak was cooked perfectly for those who ordered steaks.  My shrimp and butter was warm but I didn't complain as the restaurant was so crazy busy.  We had a great experience but some of the small touches, like having enough salad dressing for salad, burnt toast or not piping hot fish was a couple of things that is not usually reflective of the KEG.  All in all we had a nice meal and great time."}
{"text":"We ate here opening night yesterday.  The Keg is a formula and they've done a great job with the brand and the quality over the years.  This place certainly didn't disappoint even though it was the first night for everyone there.  There was a huge amount of staff on hand just in case but it all went very smoothly.  The food was great and the wine list was actually better than I expected.  That said we brought our own wine in the event that the list was lacking, which was fine, and they had a $25 corkage fee which is the norm for this neighborhood.  Great decor, quite busy, a little loud in the area we were but there were lots of quieter options.  I would take it over the overpriced Jacob & Co. for steak in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food was great there are no complaints.  I had the New York Strip medium rare with veggies on the side . It consist of asparagus , red peppers and mushrooms . Medium rare was cooked to medium rare.  Though there are a few portions of the steak with alot of fat and it's a bit chewy  and hard to swallow.   Tuna tartar was were pretty good . It's heavy.  I was full by the time I was finished with the iceberg salad and tuna tartar.  Jumbo cocktail shrimp was not bad . Overall food was decent .   The only con was we waited for about 15 minutes before someone came to our table when we were seated. And takes a while for the waitress to come refill your water. And you gotta ask for napkins."}
{"text":"Booked New Years at this location... they took a reservation for 9pm for 6 people.   Walked in at 8:50 and it was completely packed as expected.  After fighting my way to the front desk... I advised them that we were here, and within 10 minutes, we were plucked out of the crowd and brought to our table.   Not a big thing... but they handled the crazy crowd well and delivered nicely on the reservation.  My friends and I were pleased... and the food is always great.  :)  Happy New Years!!"}
{"text":"Needs no introduction! Great steak house. Had filet mignon with b√©arnaise sauce. Perfectly cut, seasoned & cooked. Excellent experience"}
