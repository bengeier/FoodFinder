{"text":"Friendly service and really good food. Tucked in a plaza south of Hwy 9 but worth the drive! We had bruschetta platter and chicken parmigiana. They use local ingredients and support local farms. Check out their Facebook page too! The owners are friendly and make their food from scratch. We loved our meals and plan on going back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and would highly recommend to anyone who might be passing by this area! Great for Italian food and even though it is not a very large establishment they have a pretty big menu to pick from. Would definitely come back here again!!!   Service 5/5 - We came here as a group of 6 people on a Friday night around 6/7pm. There were only two other families here when we came and it was fully packed by the time we left. We were quickly seated and our drink orders were taken right away. The waiter recommended a couple of beer on tap options. The staff are very friendly and showed us a place we can hang our jackets for more space. It took a little bit of time for him to return for the food order as the place was starting to fill up. Otherwise the staff here are super friendly and love to converse with their customers. It's a very homey/family feel here.   Taste - 6/5 - We ordered two large pizzas (Margherita and Potato, Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions, two pastas (Speghetti & Meatballs & Penne with Vodka Sauce), the house salad, and calamari. Everything was amazingly delicious! I especially loved the vodka sauce with the Penne. It was extremely rich and flavourful. The calamari was also super crisp and crunchy. The pizzas were amazing and love the thin crust and the cheese in the margherita. You really can't get this authentic taste in many places.  Ambiance/Décor - 3/5 - We stumbled upon this place because it was one of the closet restaurants in proximity to our uncle's house in Mono. At first arrival you wouldn't really think too much of this place since it is in a corner plaza and not too much emphasis placed on the décor. There were an extra large wine glass I remember seeing for the corks from their wines which was a nice touch. Otherwise, there wasn't much in terms of the décor I can remember from. The food here is really the star.   Portion - 5/5 - Fully stuffed and all dishes come very large. We were very full but had to try as hard as we cant to finish the food because it was soooo incredibly tasty!  Look at the size of that large pizza!!! Almost the size of the table!  Price - 6/5 - This place offers one of the best bang for your buck in terms of the food quality and service. Would definitely try to come back here again when I have a chance. $14 for pasta dish, what a steal!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dining experience here! The staff were so friendly.   I tried the four seasons pizza which had a fresh eggs, artichoke, and other things that I cannot remember. The pizza crust was very tasty and the thickness at the bottom of the pizza was just right. My only comment would be that the toppings were a bit too salty for me.   I ordered the 12\" (smallest size) pizza for $16 and it was so filling. I couldn't even finish half the pizza, I ended up taking a bit more than half the pizza home.   I tried some of my friend's fries and they were so good. They tasted like fresh cut potatoes. If you like those kind of chewy real potato tasting fries then these are for you."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small strip mall just south of hwy 9 on Airport Rd., lies a little gem of food.  After driving by for almost a year, I decided to give it a shot.  I think I was speaking with the owner on the phone to place my take-out order.  Without knowledge of the menu, I asked for a suggestion for a dinner takeout.  She offered pasta dishes, and a lamb burger, which makes me think this is their specialty, but I chose mushroom risotto, grilled chicken with a side salad.   I am a unsophisticated foodie; I simply judge food by its taste but can taste the quality or lack thereof in food.   The mushroom risotto was simple, perfectly cooked and a taste explosion! The rice was al dente, the fresh mushrooms prevalent but not overpowering, and the dish perfectly seasoned.  The sun-dried tomato/red pepper and greens salad was as fresh as ever, spiked with a great combination of balsamic and oil.  Note: if getting take out, ask for the dressing on the side.  The greens are an arrangement of delicate lettuces and seedlings, so the salad gets soggy quickly.  The grilled chicken was simply spiced,  with perfectly burnt bits combined with juiciness.  It is apparent by the flavour and freshness  of the food, that these people source local meat and produce, which is honourable and differentiating from restaurants in the area. The portions are massive, which is right on point for its country location. I Will return to try their Pizza and Lamb Burgers, with eagerness.   The service is friendly and unassuming.  Locals.........please support this little gem of a restaurant. Our area is in dire need of a place like this!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and had the kitchen salad, calamari, cheeseburger, fish and chips and pizza. The food came hot and fresh. Strong bold flavours and delicious. The pizza is the highlight. Authentic Italian! We are so glad we ordered the large size so we could take some home and eat the next day. The service was really friendly and inviting. It was a bit disorganized but it was really busy the night we were there. The whole kitchen is open and it is a really nice ambiance. You do feel part of the place. They had a very talented and lovely jazz singer by the name of Elvira Hopper sing that night who was amazing."}
{"text":"The pizzas there are very good. A 12' is way enough for two. The staff was very nice. They let us combine two pizzas into one (half-half). Nice place."}
{"text":"Nice location at hwy 9 & Airport Rd. Intimate yet casual. Nice for date night or family & friends enjoying a meal.  Friendly staff, attentive and helpful.  Nice menu with something for everyone. Prime Rib, penne a la vodka, Chicken Parmigiana, Lamb, nice wine & beer selections and delicious desserts.  Great atmosphere, live music evenings.  Nice night out."}
{"text":"Great place to stop as your heading from Toronto to Blue Mountain. Food was amazing - Service was great and super friendly. We'll be back!"}
