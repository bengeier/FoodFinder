{"text":"Food ***** - Service ***** - Ambience *****  Fairly new restaurant but has become our regular haunt. We have tried many hakka places around the GTA and we find this the best. Most hakka chinese places serve food that tastes the same no matter what they call it. But this one makes the difference.   Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"I liked this place! They have good special options, great portions, and decent prices. My General Tao plate was pretty good. Service was great, as well."}
{"text":"Great place for Hakka food. The portions are great for sharing. We ordered the chicken pakora, Manchurian beef and house special fried rice. All dishes were scrumptious and prepared fresh. Our favorite was the chicken pakora, crispy outside, tender inside. It came with a side of chili sauce that would make your lips burn, in a good way! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was urged to visit Hakka Ren due to its mixed reviews and my curiosity wanted to confirm what the ravings were about. They're right - the food is tempered with spicy flavours so beware when ordering. We ordered off the lunch specials and they were decent sized portions which satisfied our hungry appetite. The specials were served with soup as well as a serving of rice or noodles with your preferred entree. I would order the sweet corn soup or the chili baby corn again... But for takeout. Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is really nice and clean. However, the service is peculiar. We were a table of two on a Wednesday at about 1PM. There were a couple other tables but I wouldn't consider it to be \"busy\" as they were well staffed and each staff could have had their own table to look after even. Our waitress seemed very impatient throughout our whole dining experience starting by rushing for us to order. We asked for water three times before a different waiter served us by complete coincidence. I had a mouthful of food and plenty left on my plate when she asked if we wanted our food to be packed. We were confused because we were served not even five minutes prior to her asking us. The most infuriating was as we continued to eat our meal, she asked us FOUR times (without exaggeration) if we were going to pay by card or cash. Mind you we weren't even halfway through our meals. She made us feel very unwelcome because she was so insistent on having us leave. I could've understood if it was busy and they needed tables but the restaurant had most of its tables available and it wasn't rush hour. I'm not sure what prompted her to urge us so but it ruined my experience with Hakka Ren. Perhaps I'd consider takeout at a later time but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for anything more than the food."}
{"text":"There is a one good Hakka restaurant in Mississauga finally. Yinyang fried rice tastes good! Their chicken crispy outside and soft inside. Will comeback again."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant a couple of weeks back using Yelp, I had an unexpected family emergency so I could not write a review at the time.  The restaurant serves Hakka which is a fusion of Indian and Chinese. When called to make an order for takeout I was courteously received over the phone and my order of fried rice and chicken pakora were taken. I was only at Square One but the food was ready by the time to pick up.  The manager and hostess were both welcoming and made sure I was being helped. I was told the place recently opened.  I ate the chicken pakora while I was in the car, I could not resist. I would have eaten more but they were so fresh they were piping hot almost burnt my tongue driving.  The portions were big, I am a big guy and gave up at the halfway mark. Definitely serves more than 1, the rice file the styrofoam container.  Food was good but it would not be my first choice for Chicken pakora and fried rice. I will definitely be back though and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I've never seen such a bad management like this before. Very bad service. Awful server and manager. We ordered 2 items both named szechuan. I ordered szechuan noodles and my husband ordered szechuan fried rice. We said it clearly. I don't know what the server heard and realized she said something like both szechuan (**something**) which was not cleared. We thought she was saying both were szechuan..that's why I said yes not realising what's coming next. Guess what!! server came with 2 bowl of noodles. And when we said we ordered one rice and one noodles. She was like, you ordered this I confirmed you said 2 noodles. My husband said, why we would ordered the same items twice? Ask your manager, I should honor your customer. She went inside, and came with the bowl and asking are you taking the bowl?? We can't compensate this. This gonna waste. We became so frustrated, my husband asked again, you made the wrong item and expecting us to take it!! We asked politely to talk to her manager. She came with the bowl again, and told that her manager said we can get the item that we ordered but we have to pay for three items. Even if we don't want the 2nd bowl of noodles, we have to pay for that too. So, my husband became annoyed and said he won't take the 2nd item and will pay for that too and never gonna come back again. We paid for both. We will never recommend anyone to this place again."}
{"text":"Food was ordered and it's been half an hour and the food is still not here, the house is not packed by any means and it's a friday night, this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on the weekend. Very impressed with the quality of food, the prices, the portions, the service and the cleanliness. So yummy, will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"One of the better hakka choices in Sauga. Leans more towards Chinese than the Indian side of hakka.  Love they have a good number of veggie options, chili tofu is a favorite."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean interior and friendly service.  But the food could benefit from more \"zing\"!  Only the shrimp pakora was considered really tasty.  The Yin Yang Chicken fried rice/noodle and Chili paneer passable, but definitely needed more seasoning.  And the crispy beef was TOO crispy to the point you cannot chew the meat...it was drier than jerky.  I've definitely had better crispy beef at other Hakka places.    For the chili paneer, although we asked for \"dry\", the paneer pieces were still coated with gravy.  I can only imagine that if we asked for the paneer with gravy, it would be like soup! Additionally, the pieces of paneer were tiny.    There are so many choices of hakka now in Mississauga (and GTA) that I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.  (And I DO go out of my way for hakka!)"}
{"text":"Great food, very delicious and excellent service :) I'd recommend crispy beef (beware spicy has a kick to it), chilli chicken dry (still has some gravy on it), Manchurian fried rice, Hakka chow mien with vegetables and the Singapore noodles with chicken. Best two dishes were chilli chicken and the crispy beef by far :) great service; will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and its the best Hakka I've had in a while. Last night too was a take order and we had to wait atleast 30 mins for the food but the food made up for that. Mike the owner was very amicable and honest about the wait time which i appreciated.   The food and portion sizes was great. The price was reasonable too. Being a stickler for quality though, I do have a couple of bones to pick. First that the fried rice had very few veggies despite being told it comes loaded with veggies. And this is important for a vegetarian like me. And the chilli paneer i got, the paneer was tough and rather over fried. Given how i make my own paneer at home and am quite well versed with how it should really taste like, i think the paneer they used may have been frozen, thawed and then fried for longevity..which compromised quality. Another issue was that i order four dishes and ended with 5 on the bill and the takeout. Not sure if this was an oversight or miscommunication.   But everything we got tasted great, and was not doused with salt and oil which is great. Overall great food and good service."}
{"text":"A small establishment but very tasty food and excellent service! Our waitress was very patient and accommodating to our large group and special requests.  I would call ahead for smaller groups; they are quite small and may not be able to accommodate during the busy hours."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed!  I just had a date with the wife here.  Service:  attentive, prompt, pleasant.  Ambience:  modern, comfortable.  Midday Thursday, few other guests.  Food:  delicious, fresh, plentiful.  Ordered fish in hot garlic sauce, roast chicken, spicy potato with gravy.  We then ordered extra roast chicken to take home to treat family, and they gave complementary rice.  Location: very accessible, at Hurontario/Eglinton southeast plaza.  Plenty of parking.  Price: very good.  Four dishes with two extra rice servings totaled $52 pre-tip.   Overall, I would gladly recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are top notch.  I love Indian food and I love Chinese food.  Hakka is the best of both worlds and Hakka Ren is definitely the best I've ever had.  I heard there was a new place opening so I decided to check it out and this will now be my go to place for sure.  Their shrimp pakora was to die for.  Their manchurian beef was also the best I've ever had.  We ordered a lot of the \"house specials\" because I always like to taste a chef's/restaurant's \"specials\" in order to gage how well they do things.  I was sure glad I did.  The house special soup was incredible.  Perfect amount of spice.  The yin yang szechuan rice is also one of their specials and absolutely incredible.  Their selections are quite vast so I had a difficult time choosing but I was quite hapy with the selections we made.  Oh and the spring chicken.  I've never had chicken like that before.  It's like battered chicken pieces with green onion in the batter or something.  All in all it was a fantastic meal and the staff was super nice and attentive.  The portions were massive and I just finished the take home stuff we brought because we couldn't finish it at the restaurant I was stuffed.  The prices are great, let alone when you get two big lunches out of as well the following days.  I would strongly recommend going here if you're looking for something special for a great price.  It's unique and also very clean which I look for in everywhere I eat obviously.  I'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Since the loss of Ming Room at Hurontario / Dundas we've been looking for a suitable hakka Chinese replacement for a while.   Chilli chicken house is also great but better for take out than sit in, though I think they are currently doing some renos.   Federick is good too south of Dundas and then there's Wang's Kitchen in the same plaza as Hakka Ren.   This place is relatively new.  It was a Japanese restaurant before.   Being new it is nice, clean and bright.  The food selection is excellent,  preparations are hot and fresh, and most importantly Delicious! :) We normally get the hakka noodles and some chicken dish like with mixed vegetables or broccoli. They can customize different tastes/sauces with various dishes.  (Tried the Tamarind sauce and it was bit too tangy). All in all a nice restaurant with good food and good prices. Service is usually great as well.  I've never been in here when it's busy, and have frequented a handful of times now."}
{"text":"First time trying Hakka food, the food was delicious and service was great! Highly recommend the drums of heaven"}
{"text":"If you are craving for spicy vegetarian noodles. This is the best place. I won't sit here and eat but take outs are good. I hope they don't cook vegetarian and meat in the same wok though."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Hakka Chinese spot in mississauga. The serving sizings are well worth the reasonable prices. The food is so so fresh. Unlike other Hakka restaurants this one does not charge $15+ dollars a plate for chicken/fish/beef drowned in soya sauce, I can actually taste the different flavours in my mouth!   The atmosphere is modern, clean, and open which is also nice. I just hope that management is able to keep up the cleanliness and the spacious atmosphere as this joint gets more popular .  The service is awesome too! The host and the servers I've dealt with have always been courteous and pleasant. Food is on your table pretty fast and they check up on you often to make sure you are doing fine without being overbearing.  I just hope that they are able to maintain their quality AND quantity of food as they continue to grow their business - because right now it's a pretty sweet deal!"}
{"text":"I was so stoked to try this place cause I just started a new job. Initially had planned to order for my entire company from here but boy am I glad I tried it out first.  First of all the booths on the right side of the restaurant are slanted. Not a biggie for most but it made my friend and I both nauseous so we moved. Our waiter had strong BO but I tolerated it because I was quite excited to try this place.  Ordered the eggplant, chilli fish and shrimp pakoras. Tried to find the famous Hakka noodles but couldn't so asked if they could check if they serve \"foong-mei\" noodles - signature hakka noodles and they said no only to then finally find it on the menu under caramelized noodled.   First of all everything was SO salty I nearly cried the sodium out of my throat. The chilli fish was a let down. The shrimp pakora packed the right punch for flavour but the batter inside was uncooked and runny - worst"}
{"text":"I should start off by saying I really wanted to like Hakka Ren. Anyone that knows me knows that I would order Hakka for my last meal on death row...just not from Hakka Ren.   We ordered five dishes between two people: sweet corn chicken soup, the ubiquitous chilli chicken, fried rice, Manchurian chicken and Hakka chow mein noodles with beef. First off, I hold any hakka place to its sweet corn soup. It's the barometer for everything else on the menu. In Hakka Ren's case, the soup had undissolved bits of corn starch jelly (just no!), and the chicken was comprised of gelatinous globs of dark meat (yum?). The chill chicken and Manchurian chicken were virtually indistinguishable from each other except for the fact that the latter had a gravy and the former was ordered in its dry variation. The problem here is that both dishes tasted overwhelmingly of soy sauce, and nothing else. And the Manchurian chicken was over-salted to the point of being inedible. The chow mein noodles were not bad, but the beef in it was bland, grey and gamey. The fried rice was good, but not the best I've had.   Obviously I didn't have everything on the menu, but its hard to get behind Hakka Ren for screwing up the Hakka staples. Perhaps we were very unlucky that night, and perhaps they will get better. For now, I would recommend that you stick to your Hakka favourites, and give Ren a try after they have been open for a year or so."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow.  The food was really good and the service is great. Started with chicken spring rolls and curry chicken spring rolls, those were amazing. Got beef fried rice and sweet and sour chicken and that blew us away. Will definitely come back here for take out too!"}
{"text":"Just across the street from my folks' place...  After trying Emerald Chinese Restaurant (and feeling somewhat violated) I demanded some type of redemption that there was somewhat decent Asian food in this part of Mississauga.  So mom says there's a Hakka place across the street that 'just' opened...   Do yourself a favour and eat here! The food was sooo damn good! We ordered the Spring Chicken, Egg Fried Rice and, what goes without saying, Chili Chicken, since any self-respecting Hakka restaurant should be able to hold their own with that particular item. In essence, the Spring Chicken is much akin to the Chicken Pakora without the spice, but also has green onion in the pakora batter. Very nice. The Egg Fried Rice was very mellow and the rice was cooked perrrrfectly. Even more shocking was the amount of rice, which was packed to the top of the takeout container, as if I got two orders of rice. SCORE! And for the Chili Chicken? It was excellent. Not too spicy, but had a good amount of heat that can be handled by anyone, yet adjusted to be more hot and spicy with the included hot sauce.  Mom gives it a 10/5. I concur. Great Job Hakka Ren!"}
{"text":"Do not order American chopsuey with crispy noodles. I was disappointed. Service was fair. They forgot 1 of our orders and waited too long for them to make it. Will not be returning back as they screwed up or our order last year too."}
{"text":"Great food guys! Definitely not as great as Chili Chicken, but holds their own in central Mississauga.   Ps.  The staff was very pretty. I'd come back just for her. Darla? Very nice."}
{"text":"Great service, very clean modern place. Had the Hakka fried rice, chicken and beef, the portions are huge for 8.99! Also the chicken and broccoli was pretty good. Although I admit I've had better elsewhere but this place is definitely pretty good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lunch that we had here. I'm glad to have found a new hakka place that's in Mississauga.  Décor - more on the modern side with dark booth and tables, and lighter walls. The booth seats were comfy.  We liked most of the dishes we had here. For appetizers we ordered the fish pakora is was delicious. The serving sizes are big and we got quite a lot of pakora's to share. The fish was soft and flaky, and cooked perfectly. The batter was light and had chili in it, which added a nice spicy kick to it. So if you don't like spicy food beware.    We got the garlic shrimp noodles, which were tasty too. It had the yellow egg noodles, with vegetables, the shrimp was cooked well. The garlic flavour was present but not over powering.   I also enjoyed the House Special Beef, that comes with a slightly sweet sour dark sauce. It was also very tasty and also had a bit of a kick to it.  We also ordered one of the chicken dishes. But it wasn't one of my favourites.   The server was friendly, and was able to recommend popular dishes to our table. The service was quick and were got our food in a timely manner. We came late afternoon on a Sunday so it wasn't. The rest of the staff was also friendly.  I definitely be back to try some more of their food."}
{"text":"First time having Hakka food in Mississauga and it was really good. Typically, go to Scarborough to satisfy my Hakka cravings but decided to try something new this week. The servings were quite large for what we ordered.Not that spicy compared to what I am used to but still really good. The service was topnotch and would definitely make the trek to try it again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food with HUGE portions.   Went here pretty late night on saturday and it was PACKED. Understandably the service was a little spotty at times but overall pleasant.   Not knowing how huge the portions were, we ordered a hot and sour soup, chili chicken, fish pakora, and Hakka noodles.   The hot and sour soup came out first and we were apprehensive at first seeing all the little pepper bits in this bright red soup. But it wasn't actually as spicy as it looked and the flavour is a little different from what I'm used to at traditional Chinese restaurants. It tasted more like a sour BBQ sauce? Which sounds pretty obscure but actually tasted quote good. It was actually one of the better dishes.   Next we received the fish pakoras. The mixed signals continue as the green sauce it is served with is SO SPICY! Not for the faint of heart for sure! I had to go on and eat the pakoras dry which were still really tasty. Perfectly crispy and jam packed with fish. However, very very very salty. My lips almost curled up eating this.  We got the chili chicken a bit after and in comparison to another Mississauga hakka restaurant (chili chicken house) I don't think it was quite as good. Still pretty flavorful but the chicken could have been marinated more, if at all. As the chunks are quite large, the outside parts that were covered in sauce were flavorful while the inside bites were a bit lackluster. Overall still pretty good but needs improvement.   Finally the Hakka noodles. This my sister ordered and I was not sure what to expect. Personally I felt it was really underwhelming and I don't recommend it as I'm sure they have many other better dishes. This dish is made up of dry lightly-salted noodles stir fried with shrimp. The shrimp were tiny and didn't seem proportionate to the amount of noodles given. But maybe that's your steeze?   Overall, we left with enough food for another meal for all 3 of us for the next day. So Hakka Ren definitely gets an A+++ for value. Their popularity certainly reflects this as well. Not the best food I've ever had but it definitely hits the spot if you're in need for some delicious Hakka food."}
{"text":"So it was \"on demand\" spicy items on the menu for the family today .. Manchurian fish was the highlight though I dont accept basa to be a fish. Sea Bass is a good alternative, and I am sure will turn out much better (hope the chef reads this) .. Szechuan chow mein, chilli chicken and hot & sour soup were great picks .. chilli beef dry was good, but not the calibre of a true dry beef, as I have had at another Hakka restaurant .. good food, good customer service, hence consistency is the deal for success. Well done Hakka Ren!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. I requested for non spicy noodles and the chef did a great job. My kids loved it. Just ordered take out :)."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  I still love this place. It's one of my favourite hakka restaurants in Mississauga but damn, why is the service so damn slow?!   My sister made reservations for 7:30pm for her birthday dinner. None of the servers came to see us until 20 mins later and we didn't get our food until 8:30pm! We had to ask for water which took about half an hour.   Love this place but something needs to be done about the service."}
{"text":"I first tried this place a couple years ago and was very impressed with the food. Came back a few times afterwards and had a great experience. This time however, we had an awful time. We started off with hot and sour soup. Usually this soup has a good mix of spice and tanginess, but this time it was nothing like before. Completely bland, over cooked chicken, and no flavor whatsoever. Then our food came to the table. Kung pao beef and Szechuan chicken with fried rice. Both dishes were absolutely terrible. Same as the soup. No flavor at all. Just spicy without purpose. We told our server about to food and asked to see the manager. He informed us that no manager was on duty, and gave us the owner's card. We our for our meal out of respect and left without eating. Then we stepped outside and called \"Micheal\" the owner. He listened to our critiques and was not receptive. He told us we should \"try putting a little salt on the food\" to make it taste better. We were shocked by the type of customer service provided. The conversation continued, and the owner went off on us and ended up saying \"don't come back to my restaurant.\" I'm disgusted by the way we were treated. Will never be coming back to this establishment. We were just looking to have a nice family dinner for Canada day, and this place singled handedly ruined our weekend. Stay far away."}
{"text":"I am a regular at eddies Hakka Chinese but recently I have been visiting a new Chinese restaurant, Hakka Ren. The food here is scrumptious, especially the sweet and sour chicken. The helpings are bounteous and the pricing is good too. The service is pleasant and the food is halal. All in all the restaurant is a great place to go with family on Sunday night dinners and I highly recommend it. Very clean place and great service also."}
{"text":"This place is only second to Ming Room. Finally a proper Hakka Chinese restaurant within a 20mins-one transit distance! The food is to my taste and finally a place around town that has properly spiced up food. Some places either load up the hot sauce which is basically just Vinegar and Chillies, just load up on chilli flakes, or make the dish with 30% chopped chillies. There are so many other spices that can be combined to get the right spice and the right spiciness. Not sure whether Hakka Ren did it tgat way but, it was done right.   Had their Heavenly Chicken Legs which was a good starter. My 8 year old son loved it too. The Singapore Chowmein and the Hakka Fried Rice was awesome. To seal the deal, the Chicken on Hot Garlic Sauce hit the right spot. The portions were just right with a little left overs to bring home for what I call a \"Greedy Snack.\" Supprisingly we were not offered the traditional tea pot usually offered in any Chinese restaurant. I kind of like having tea over Coke when eating a proper spicy meal.  The seating is comfy and spacious. However, I am yet to find a restaurant that has sufficient dish space. The restaurant needs a little brightening up as well. I can understand that they have tried to give it a little ambience but, a little too darkish for my liking.  The cost can be calculated as an average of $10 per dish. Quite reasonable for the quality of food and size of the portions.  Went on a Sunday at about 2pm and the place was not crowded. The server was very friendly. Would have appreciated a little proactive recommendations though.  Place is certainly worth a second visit."}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening dinner, we were seated immediately. The restaurant was almost full. The staff courteous and could converse with ease. The interior was done well and clean.   We ordered a medium Hot and Sour Soup which came out in a few minutes. The colour not the usual Hakka style as it looked more brownish and many of the Hakka soups were dark Soya Sauce coloured. The temperature not too hot. The spice level more towards mild or medium rather than spicy. The sourness was OK. Would have loved some fresh veggies in it.   We also got a Veggie Fried Rice, a Veg Manchurian, a Veg Hakka Chowmein and a Mixed Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce. And yes a bowl of plain rice. The plain rice quantity was amazing.   We requested less oil to be used in Fried Rice and Chowmein. The rice was done properly but not the noodles. The Rice although good, lacked the spicy flavour that comes along with Hakka food. The same for noodles as well. The quantity was fairly good.   The Veggie Manchurian was perfectly done. The mini pakoras Fried to perfection and sauced just with the right amount of spice. However the quantity was a big miss. When you compare the rice and Chowmein the Manchurian felt as it was half plate.   And that's we had to order the mixed veggies in garlic sauce. Same the quantity was way too less. The dish also lacked garlic flavour. I have had this dish elsewhere and you  felt garlicky at first bite, here it felt that garlic was probably a side spice.   A good place, but they need to re-think about their quantity on some of their dishes."}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning experience ever! My mom and I went here for a late lunch yesterday and are still suffering the consequences. We ordered chicken pakoras with hakka rice and kung pao chicken. The taste was ok. Nothing great. However, the after effects were enough to swear off hakka food altogether!"}
{"text":"It was amazing! I had the chilli fish schezuan fried rice garlic chowmein and vegetable fritters. All delicious"}
{"text":"Came twice during the winter break to this place.  Still very impressed with their quantity and reasonable price. Their veg chow mein is still as good as it was before. But I will take back what I said about this place competing with Chili Chicken House. The latter's chicken is just toooo good.  The hot garlic chicken at hakka ren is bland and the chili chicken just isn't the same.  If only the prices at Chili Chicken House didn't keep going up and up."}
{"text":"I have eaten better Hakka food! The place is clean and new.... The service was ok... We had manchow soup it was way too spicy, for starters we had squid rings those were good, for main we had beef and broccoli mind you like most Hakka places they don't offer a complimentary bowl of rice we had to order that and we had veg chowmein I felt it had more dry spices rather than sauced spices."}
{"text":"Love the spring chicken. Soooo delicious. Always busy. Service is good. Food is great and love that the spicey food doesn't burn your tongue but just gives you an awesome sweat. Love their fried chicken"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and its a pure gem. The food and service is very consistent. We order the hot and sour soup and its so flavourful with a perfect spiciness to it. Followed by the chilli chicken, crispy beef, and the Hakka fried rice. The chilli chicken is amazing, Nice and spicy. The crispy beef is delicious with a bit of sweetness to it. They do a great job cooking the food, and great service too. This is a frequent hangout for me. Highly recommend the chilli chicken."}
{"text":"First time here and no real disappointment.  Very busy place even at 9pm on Saturday.   The initial impression was so-so though since it was very smoky.  They definitely need to work on the ventilation/exhaust system in the restaurant-or you can chalk it up as a more authentic Hakka experience :)  The food was quite good.  The portions were decent and the spice had a bit of kick but not wow give me the milk!  The chicken and the fish was both quite tasty and cooked right.  The spring roll was a bit watery on the inside but very crispy and not burnt on the outside so it was still satisfactory.  The Shanghai noodles actually tasted a little bit sweet which is unique..we fixed that by adding a bit of hot sauce.  We definite picked a good spot in Sauga!"}
{"text":"Hakka food with their own twist. Great ! Shrimp Pakora with Chutney .. DELISH .. Especially the home made chutney!! Very spicy .. Yum !! Manchurian chicken and house special tiger prawn on spot. Nice interior decoration. Would come back again .. Omg I'm so full"}
{"text":"I'm definitely going to need to up my heat tolerance, because this place is one hot joint!  ...Sorry.  I used to frequent this location when it used to be Zem One (RIP.  And before you try to inform me that it simply moved locations - I know, and I stand by what I've said).  I came in feeling a tad nostalgic, but also intrigued.  Lighting, decor, and atmosphere were much brighter,happier than the previously dim sushi restaurant.  We arrived during the downtime, and were promptly seated, and served.  The wait staff were extremely friendly, accommodating and helpful with menu selection.  We ordered the house fried rice, chicken pakoras, and house sauce tiger prawn (as per the waitress' recommendation).   Food came in good time and were large in portions!  The fried rice was well seasoned and had good meat portions, the pakoras were very delicious (little spicy for me, but as mentioned earlier, I need to work on that).  The tiger prawns was one of the best shrimp dishes I've had in a long time.  Too long have I been subjected to mediocre shrimp that were no larger than the tip of my thumb; these prawn were huge.  I mean, 2-bite huge. The sauce mixed very well with the rice, and added a sweet/spicy flavoring to the meal.  I was extremely happy with this recommendation.  The only reason why I've docked a star is because of service.  As friendly as they were, there were only 2 people manning the front, with one of them (probably the boss) seemingly busy with other tasks.  The one waitress left was essentially made to serve all tables, bus all the food, clean the front station, provide drinks, etc.  Due to no fault of her own, I had to wait some time to ask for the bill, and get water refill.  And trust me, when the food is spicy, every second counts.  Eventually they provided me my own water jug (as a joke, but in seriousness, greatly appreciated).  Ultimately I was extremely happy with the experience I had here, and am definitely coming back.  Hopefully by then my tolerance will have increased some measure... if not I might just have to bring my own water jug!"}
{"text":"I visited Hakka Ren within the first month of its opening. They had a 15% off grand opening special, which was a nice surprise.  The decor inside Hakka Ren was more modern than most Hakka places I've been to. It was quite busy for a Friday evening as well - nearly at full capacity.   We were quickly seated and we glanced through the menu. They are priced about 10% higher than other hakka places in the area - so they already had some ground to make up to catch up to their competitors like Chili Chicken House and Eddie's. There were a lot of interesting menu items that differed from traditional hakka offerings, but I didn't decide to try those out on this visit. I went with the staple hot and sour soup with chili chicken.  Then, we waited.   It was quite busy and still within a month of their opening so I could understand increased wait times, but it took about half an hour to receive our soup. That's pushing it. The chili chicken also took a while to come out. I hope they can improve these times for my next visit as it was much too long of a wait.  However, the food was nearly good enough to make up for the wait. The hot and sour was among the best I've had - you could really taste the broth. The chili chicken had a nice kick to it and was very tender and juicy.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but it was clear that they were experiencing growing pains and seemed unable to accommodate a large volume of customers in timely fashion. However, I'd say that their food would justify their price increase compared to other Hakka places in the area - it's that good.   Look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Hakkah (Halal Chinese Food) places in all of Mississauga. The food is very delicious with really good portions and it's really clean here. The staff of friendly. Only downside is that on weekend dinner hours, you have to wait upto 20-30 mins to get an available seat. But that just shows how much people like eating here."}
{"text":"We often pass by Hakka Ren restaurant and finally decided to give it a try after getting a recommendation from a coworker.  That decision turned out to be a good idea.  Hakka is generally used to describe a Chinese-Indian fusion cuisine and our experience at Hakka Ren was exactly that.  We ordered a Chicken Lun Feng soup (a tasty chicken soup with a mix of vegetables), a house special chicken and a rice&noodle mix plate.  The portions at the restaurants are large and the food was very flavorful.  I enjoyed the soup and had three servings of it.  The house special chicken was crispy and covered with a sweet&sour sauce with just a hint of spicy.  The rice and noodle plate was very large and we ended up really full.  The service at the restaurant was friendly and overall we received good attentive service.  I liked Hakka Ren and would recommend it for those looking for reasonable pricing, big portions and bold, sometimes spicy Hakka style Chinese food.  3.7 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This is probably the most disgusting Hakka food in the city. Service was HORRIBLE. We ordered vegetable friend rice and they brought us yin yang rice, had to send it back and wait 20 minutes for the correct order to come out. All of the dishes taste the same. Left without eating anything and asked to speak to the manager and they told us there was no manager available. Then asked for the owner and was told there's no owner available. Called the owner and he was the most rude person to exist. Didn't give us a refund for his nasty so-called food and told us if we have a problem then don't come back. This place is definitely going to close down. HORRIBLE FOOD AND HOSPITALITY. DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a quick, filing meal. The service is pretty quick and they get your take out meal to go pretty fast.   My go to meal here is the chili fish with extra gravy. Sooooo good! (This is actually my go to meal for any hakka place)   I've also dined in here, and the environment is pretty lively with a family vibe to it.   Pretty good, thumbs up."}
{"text":"Ordered take out Hakka chowmein, stir fry vegetables, tiger prawn dry, and chicken corn soup, food was ready quickly and was nice and hot.  Portions are good, but quality could be better for the price charged. Mainly came here due to convenient location."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and am so glad we did. This is probably one of the better hakka places that I have gone to so far.  The food is absolutely delicious. It really is. The portions are great and the prices are reasonable for dining in or take out.   We tried the Hakka Roasted Chicken with a special sauce and that was simply divine that you have to try it! And we also ordered the Fried chicken and shrimp rice and the sweet and sour fish and they were all so good as well!   We will be definitely back in the future to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Came to the all New Hakka Ren ! And ...what's the consensus? ... The inside, the Decor is pretty nice , very clean and modern !  I like Hakka food so I know a lot of the dishes . So I ordered the Chilli Fish with gravy . Price ...a little higher then my favourite Hakka joint and a little higher than most Hakka places I've been to .  But how was the food you ask ?  Honestly , pretty decent ...good portion and tasty !  I still can't compare it to my favourite spot cause there really is No comparison there . However if your in the area , and feel like Hakka this place is nice , clean , and food is good !  Service was fairly good aswell .  Give them a try !"}
{"text":"Best chilli and Manchurian fish, and the chilli chicken was amazing ! The waitresses were super nice but looked like they were understaff a bit. All in all, good place to eat"}
{"text":"Love Hakka food, eat it all the time.   Was looking forward to trying this place so I ordered the chili chicken lunch special with fried rice upgrade.   Order arrived wrong, they gave me wet.   Soggy batter, no crispness.   Taste has very little heat, very little garlic and ginger. More of a soupy soy sauce gravy.  Can't stress enough about the lack of heat!  Portion size was pretty tiny IMO. My usual go-to is New China Garden in Brampton and it's literally gotta be twice as much food..  Can't say I'd be in a rush to return unfortunately  Interior is very clean and nice however"}
{"text":"By far the best Hakka place in Mississauga. This is my regular dinner spot with my work friends. The staff are nice and the food is absolutely delicious. The portions are also huge. I strongly recommend trying that fish pakoras here."}
{"text":"Best chili chicken I have ever had. So spicy I'm sweating but totally worth it! Good atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Some dear friends of mine were visiting from Kentucky and had requested Hakka food, thinking (hoping) they were getting the Jamaican style Hakka food that we grew up with. Unlike that style, the Indian style Hakka food popular in the GTA, does not include pork. They were a little disappointed to hear that but all was well after they tasted the food!  I was completely unfamiliar with Hakka Ren but chose it based on proximity to the hotel my friends were staying at and ratings published on Yelp. Looking over the menu, the dishes didn't seem to be as authentic as the places I frequent in the east end of the city. How do I know this? The menu had American Chopsuey, no bok choy, and they didn't know what snow peas tips were. They definitely catered to a more Canadian crowd.  Trusting me to make most of the choices, we ordered Chicken Pakora, Chili Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Ginger Beef, Chicken Fried Rice, and Green Beans. The food arrived quickly and looked good, although different from what I get from my usual spots. These dishes had a lot of gravy. A lot.  Despite being a little different from what I'm used to, it tasted very good. Everything was seasoned and cooked very well, with just enough heat to make it interesting. The gravy on the rice was good. For an introduction to Indo-Chinese Hakka cuisine, my friends enjoyed the food very much. That's what really counted!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I tried the lunch special which was the chilli chicken and rice. The hot and sour soup I enjoyed. Was really disappointed that they overcharged me for the lunch special."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place instead of our usual Hakka place just to change it up. Prices are a bit higher here but the decor is nicer. Portions were good and if you like spicy, they deliver on that front.  Chicken pakoras were great but the other items we ordered, fried rice and shrimp in manchurian sauce I think were just OK."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try this place a few days ago. I ordered a lunch special to go (chilli chicken and veggie fried rice). My friends ordered a few other items that I was able to try (manchurian chicken, crispy beef, a noodle dish and hot garlic chicken). First off, I would like to say that the customer service was great! 5/5 I just wish their food was just as good. I REALLY wanted this place to be as good or close to my go-to Hakka joint, Chilli Chicken House... But it's NOT even close. The food was very okay... Edible... Nothing to ride home about. I feel every Hakka place should have an awesome chilli chicken... It was, again, okay. Fried rice...fine... I Wouldn't order from here again. I hate writing mediocre reviews when the service was so great... But I didn't even finish my lunch because I was so disappointed in the food. I really hope the owners keep up with the good customer service, because then this business may last."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night, it's a new hakka joint in the Oceans plaza next to the Swiss Chalet. If anyone knows me, they know I love a good hakka feast - and Hakka Ren absolutely delivered!   The Goods: the interior is well lit and spacious, the staff were friendly and attentive, and the restaurant is easily accessible in a good location.   The Food: Very tasty! We ordered chicken pakoras, chili chicken (saucy), hakka roasted chicken w/house special sauce, manchurian rice, Hakka chow mein noodles, & crispy beef (my fave). Every dish we ordered was a pleasant surprise, since most Hakka restaurants seem to skimp out on the spiciness - but not this place!  I'd definitely recommend this place for those who enjoy authentic Hakka cuisine, and who like their dishes to have a kick of spice. I only wish the east end had hakka restos like this!"}
{"text":"The name is Hakka ren but their Hakka is basically just Chinese food. My usual place was really busy so I picked another Hakka restaurant at random to try. I was let down."}
{"text":"This place was deserted when we got there on a Sunday evening so I was skeptical and only ordered the basics. Decor is minimal with a newly (cheaply) renovated feel, everything is very clean.   Great: chicken pakoras (hot and flavourful with the best coriander chilli sauce), stir fried green beans (not overdone and delicious garlic sauce), and paneer Manchuria (excellent sauce and a kind of bouncy feel to the cheese)   Service was great and food was quick and hot! Will definitely be coming back to try other things!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night.  Restaurant was half full but service was a tad bit slow (taking the order and getting the food) but not too bad.  Ordered several dishes:  chili tiger prawns - totally awesome, highly recommend it; stir fried green beans - also awesome.  Crispy beef was ok, as was Manchurian chicken (in sauce).  Hakka fried rice was good (with chicken and shrimp).  Also got the house special fried noodle which had good quantity of meat and vegetables.  Overall very good experience and good value."}
{"text":"The prices are great and it's open pretty late! Some suggestions: the hot and sour soup is good and like every other Chinese's place; but the Manchuria soup is pretty delightful."}
{"text":"great food, bad service. bad start, good finish!  It took them 20 minutes to come and take our order(I timed and noted this in my phone LOL) once the orders were in it didn't take to long for the food to come out. The Drums of heaven(chicken lollipop) was alright, I mean I guess all the menu hype had me thinking it was some extravagant and amazing tasting chicken, but it was quite bland(maybe I got an odd batch) I felt a lot of the things we ordered lacked flavor, but minus this experience, it is pretty hard for me to find Hakka food out in the west ends so I won't cut them out completely just yet, I def have to try them again and update my review upon my second visit."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very accommodating to our group of 9 adults and 3 children. We kept ordering food and they kept bringing it out. Service was excellent. Food was good but not spectacular.  Chicken Lung Fung Soup - 5 - Very flavorful  Chicken Filled Won Ton Soup - unk - I didn't try it but it didn't look like very many won ton.  Chicken Pakora - 3 - Okay. The green sauce gave it character.  Deep Fried Chicken Wings with Yunan Sauce - 4 - Slightly messy but very flavorful.  Drums of Heaven - 3 - Good.   Beef with Broccoli - 2 - Way too much sauce.   House Special Fish - 5 - Excellent. Was supposed to be mildly spicy but I felt it was spicier.  Cauliflower Manchurian - 3 - We had ordered it dry, but they made it wet. They noticed it before we did and offered to remake it but we opted to keep it. Next time, we'll stick to dry.   Chicken Ying Yang Rice. - 2  - Either the chicken was cut very small or there was just wasn't much chicken. Flavor was somewhat bland and the dish was dry.  Vegetable Shanghai Noodles - 3 - Not nearly enough garlic or veg.   Note that this restaurant does not serve pork and one of our diners has an allergy to shrimp. Otherwise we would not have ordered as many chicken dishes. We're curious as to how different our scores would be had we ordered other proteins."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here a couple of times. They are open late and have a great variety of choices. The server was really friendly and gave on point recommendations.  Highly recommend you get the house special fish and the treasure rice (?) dish."}
{"text":"The service is SOOOO sweet here! I don't know if it was just the one Asian server we had, but he was super friendly - really made sure we had everything and answered all our questions about the menu!  Even though we went on a Wednesday night, the place was still relatively full. We got the Paneer with house sauce (it was sweet and spicy), the Eggplant with manchurian sauce, hakka styled fried rice and the hakka style chicken 10 piece. The rice was really well made, but we weren't expecting the Paneer and the Eggplant to be drenched in their sauces (Idk it's probably just a culture thing tho). However, all of it fell just under $50 which I thought was very reasonably priced. The order also came out super fast.   For its service and great pricing, would definitely recommend. Really enjoyed the elegant yet cozy vibe!"}
{"text":"I think this place may be a bit overrated. We went in a group of four and the service was very poor. We had to wait 15 minutes for our waters. They were out of a few of the menu items as well. The chicken pakora was fantastic as well as the Manchurian chicken. However, the Hakka noodles left a whole lot to be desired. We also ordered the chili beef and it was over cooked with no flavor. If you are looking for excellent Hakka this is not the place."}
{"text":"Our group at work had our usual eat-out Friday a couple of weeks ago. We headed over to Hakka Ren.   Parking can be a challenge in this area, as there are numerous eateries. We parked closer to a rather large Second Cup and walked over to the restaurant.   We got there at around noon. You beat the lunch rush that way.   The restaurant has a number of lanterns, water fountains, a lucky cat, and Buddha figures. We got a booth and ordered the following items:  - Chicken in spicy, hot garlic sauce - Manchurian fish dry - Broccoli beef with Hakka noodles  My go-to Hakka dish is spicy garlic chicken. One bite of my lunch and I knew that I loved this place. The sauce was both garlicky and had a kick. The chicken was perfectly done. I loved it.  My boss ordered Manchurian fish dry. He was impressed. It takes a lot to do that!  My colleague got the beef broccoli with Hakka noodles. You get a lot of noodles! He enjoyed his food, too.   Our server was friendly and helpful in suggesting when to drop by the restaurant. You can order takeout. I may give that a try down the road.   Debt, credit, and cash payments are accepted.  (239)"}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday night with a group of 14 people. We made reservations. I was surprised at how quickly everything came out!!! Really awesome service even though the restaurant itself was super busy. Our waiter/waitress were really attentive and picked away plates quickly as well between the appetizers and the main course. Really delicious food! We ordered 3 rice dishes, 4 types of chicken, and 3 soups. My favorite chicken was the chili chicken. Overall very impressed with the service and food. We're still wishing we could have this the next day. Wish we had something like this down in Maryland!!"}
{"text":"We wanted Hakka food and  decided to give this place a try . We were pleasantly surprised. We had a tiger shrimp curry and chilli chicken. Both were spicy and flavourful ! We finished all the food and was happy at the end of it . You could tell the ingredients were fresh ! Will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Honestly the food here is great.  This is actually my favourite Hakka Restaurant.  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their Sweet Caramelized Noodles with Chicken.  Was here for my birthday and had made reservations.  My family and I were starving and couldn't wait to eat.  Once we placed our order we expected our food to come out within 10-15 min..........NOPE we waited 30-40min for our FIRST dish to arrive.  Seriously?  My family and I were so hungry we devoured that dish like vultures.  Once that dish was done we waited another half hour for the next dish to arrive....Do they do this on purpose?  I feel like they do this so when the food arrives we won't have time/patience to critique it because we're dying of hunger and not even caring how civilized we should be as we're too busy trying not to eat each other's hands when the food arrives.  Totally kidding... their food IS great.  They really just need to work on their sloth-like service.  By the time my family and I were done eating, we realized we were in there for like 3 hours from all the waiting.  HAKKA REN PLEASE FIX THIS!"}
{"text":"Loved this new spot! Definitely coming back again. Ordered the House Fish, Hot Garlic Chicken, Cauliflower Manchurian and Drums of Heaven. Everything tasted so damn good. Service was good too and on point. Highly recommended if Im comin back. Great spot!!"}
{"text":"So, one of the great things about slicing up your hand is that your SO first drives you to get stitches, and then finds you yummy Hakka food to eat. In our case, it meant finding this tiny little gem at Eglinton and Hurontario in Mississauga. Initially, we were a bit doubtful anything would: a) be open at 9:30pm on a Monday and b) be welcoming to a person wearing the fugliest gym clothes possible (AKA. Whatever I could pull on with one hand that could hide a bloodstain if need be). But in a bland shopping plaza, tucked between a Magic Cuts and Swiss Chalet was our salvation! Hakka Ren is lovely little restaurant with magic food and phenomenal customer service. Initially it was a bit hard to find (the plaza seems to be allergic to proper signage), but the minute you walked into the bright room, you were welcome!  We were greeted warmly and seated promptly in one of the many booths. The young woman who served us was very helpful, and easily explained the menu to us when we had questions. She was very sweet. And we noticed the room was over half full; pretty impressive for a Monday night in the 'burbs.  The menu is extensive with a exceptional selection for Vegetarians. We went with the Wonton soup, Manchow soup and Manchurian Chicken (it gives you a choice of being served dry or with gravy. Get the gravy!!) with steamed rice.  My wonton soup was subtle, with a delicate broth full of white pepper and soft dumplings of chicken with a hint of ginger. While not the usual I'm used to, it really grew on me and after the fourth spoonful I actually preferred it to the traditional style I'm used to. But the Manchow was a revelation! It was similar in consistency to hot and sour soup, but lighter, with a giant punch of fresh herbs, veggies and garlic. I wish we'd gotten a bigger size and taken the leftovers home.  The Manchurian chicken was so good that I ended up eating a serving - I couldn't just have the one bite. It had a good balance of spices and chili, and was just so damn satisfying that I'm tempted to drive back there tonight for more.  It's a small, family-run place that's only been open for 3 1/2 months. It's clean, delicious and affordable, and worth every cent in mileage. Please, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fairly new restaurant in the Ocean's plaza. The food was great! We ordered Shanghai noodles, paneer in house special sauce, and Hakka style roast chicken. I'm usually not a huge fan of Hakka but this was good. Everything was very flavorful and saucy. Dishes are very reasonably priced, as well. Service is quick and friendly. The decor is pretty clean except it was kind of weird there was a gap between the booth and the wall. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Hakka Ren is one of the popular spots in town .  After being there a couple of times  I can say that the food is  quite good.  The service can be hurried on weekends so I recommend going on a  weekday.  The  dishes that  I enjoy are the szechuan chicken, the american chop suey and  the chicken  hakka chow mein .  The food  is served fresh and is an explosion of flavours . Whatever you order try to order a different dish each time to avoid boring and routine visits."}
{"text":"Clean environment but the food need more seasoning.  Understand that they have salt,  pepper, pickle chilly and sambal on top table but they not really help for the taste for the food. Why the dish not coming with the steam rice?  They just coming with steam rice if you take out?  I been eatted in Haka in many places,  this place not the bad but in here bit pricey."}
{"text":"tl;dr Food was good, but has 15% gratuity charge for 6 people  Full review: Went to this place on Saturday night. The place was packed with a lineup, so better reserve a table before showing up.   Despite the crowd, my friends and I didn't have to wait too long for our food. The best dish of the night was Crispy Beef. Though the beef was not really crispy when it arrived at our table, it tasted good.   The service was acceptable, considering how busy the night was. My only complain is the 15% gratuity for my table of 6. The waiter did not inform us about this charge beforehand, so I was shocked to see it on the bill. This costed the place 1 star, and so they deserve 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices, and open late? You sold me. We ordered 50 dollars worth of food, enough to serve 5 hungry souls. And they made sure I had everything I needed for a take-out meal, including plenty of forks, spoons, napkins, and the like.  What impressed me most is the service. Super nice folks, and they really catered to my order. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with limited seating, but avail for groups and reservations.   Upon entering, customers pile up at door waiting to be seated, as there isn't much of a waiting area.  You Place your name on a hand written waiting list.  Staff are friendly once you say hi.  They open up and offer great meal suggestions and favorites.   Lunch special meals avail and halal.  We tried the vege pakoras ( nice crispy ) with tamarind sauce , Szechuan chicken ( popular favourite), house chow mein, house fried rice and tiger shrimp fried in butter.  Bill came to $67.  Good food, good price and good portions.  Front of house manager comes to tables to say hi and check on guest. Back of house manger hand delivers some of the food to also say hi to guest.  That's customers service lacking in so many restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good food . Ambience is praiseworthy. Ordered Szechuan chicken and hakka chicken noodles. Very large quantity, I would share one dish with three. Good tasty preparation. I will certainly be back for more."}
