{"text":"Yeah, one star.

One really awful experience is all I'm basing this on. We arrived, got seated, ordered sushi. Our server took a while to pick up the sushi sheet, but no big deal; they were busy.

But an hour and a half later, our order still hadn't arrived. Half of it did, after 45 minutes, but all that did was give us a sample to let us know the sushi was \"okay.\" Not terrible, not good. The table next to us, who arrived after we did, finished their entire meal in that time. We listened as the far-too-loud music changed from \"horrid '80s clich√© butt-rock\" to \"wholly inappropriate thumping techno rave.\"

Finally we left. The manager, to be fair, did all the right things: apologized profusely, comped all our food, begged us to come back and give them a second chance. But I'm not sure we will."}
{"text":"Even though it was fun to watch the food prepared, I felt the food was overly salty.  The chef told us what the spices were before he started cooking, but since the food for the entire table was cooked together, there was no way  that I could stop him from using so much salt. The food was well cooked and would have been tasty, if it had not tasted so much like salt. 

We did not try the sushi, even though that was our original intent, because the Teppanyaki was so tempting, but priced us out of the moderate range.  ($51 for two entrees and one saki bomb)   

Also is it really necessary to charge an extra $3 to have fried rice instead of white.   

it's fun to watch the chefs cook, so entertainment is a good reason to go. The serving size was good, not huge, but filling.  If you eat teppanyaki it is served at a grill, with other people so privacy/intimacy is not an option.  The staff was pleasant but  not what I would call  friendly. 

I'm glad we tried it, and maybe we will go back and try the sushi, but I won't return for the teppanyaki."}
{"text":"I was visiting here while I was on a business trip. Of course I can not compare the service and taste to the places in Japan where I spent $10 - $20 for one sushi.
I believe the price quality were reasonable and everyone was very friendly.
If you like sushi, please don't read the bad reviews and give a shot, then have your own opinion. Enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give a negative star, I would. Went out of my way to go check this place out because of living social deal only to find that the deal I wanted to use was unavailable even though it was being advertised as an option. Argued with the manager/owner because she did not even know what deals were being advertised for her restaurant. The waitress was nice. Thats about it. Food was okay, service was horrible."}
{"text":"I'm not one to put down restaurants because I've worked in them for about four years, I know its hard. But this place is something else. I'm originally from New Jersey, So maybe I was spoiled with great sushi available whenever I want, but to make me feel better, my dad took me out to eat here, because I LOVE sushi. The first time I went there in July, I wasn't impressed. Slow service, and the rice way WAY too salty. I go back from time to time to get a California roll or two, and I asked for spicy mayo to go on the side. They literally gave me a side of hot sauce. I do, however, love their soup and respect them for doing what they do. I'll keep coming here until I can eventually find a better sushi place."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! The sushi is always fresh, it has a cool little atmosphere and very we'll priced!! They have happy hour as well as an all you can eat deal. The servers always remember me and are very nice! I always try a new roll every time I go along with my regulars and I'm never disappointed. I recommend the wasabi roll!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We waited over 15 minutes after our drinks came and they never took our order. The waitress said that she assumed our order was already placed. When we got up to leave then they realized we existed again. They still charged us for drinks even though their service was abysmal. Unfortunately, we will not be going back. The burnt out letters on their sign should have warned us that they don't care about their restaurant enough to replace some lights, what level of service can be expected."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to, they had really great Sushi. It is also the best to go there when it is not busy. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Ninja for many years, since back when they had Japanese style low table seating in curtained booths. That area was converted years ago to the Sushi Bar. The sushi is consistant. Not great but good. It is priced reasonably and especially so if you are a big eater and do the All You Can Eat for $20. We go for the Teppan Tables, though. Regularly dine Teppan style for birthdays and my family love it. One reviewer didn't like the Garlic, but that is one of my favorite things about Ninja. They add Garlic and Butter to the fried rice and the beef and seafood. I prefer it that way. A different restaurant with great food otherwise lost my business because their meat was not seasoned. The Chefs here usually ask us how much we like garlic and are willing to add or scale back, so that works for us. Their beef is always superb, the scallops are tender and the shrimp cooked just enough. I really like this place. Not the upscale experience it used to be but still very, very good. I do wish they'd tone down the techno and rock music, though. It just doesn't fit with a Japanese dinner."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences in a long time. The list goes on with this place. Should have known when the restaurant name was no where on the building that this place was going to be bad. The lady at the host stand who I would assume the owner, took ten minutes to seat us. She yelled numerous times across the dining room to her staff obnoxiously. Later she was at a table drinking wine. We were also greeted by our server, wearing a black pantyhose cap over braided corn roles. When asked if we wanted tepanyaki or sushi, answering tepanyaki, he replied \"awww lordy lordy.\" Great start. Finally sat looked at the menue. Asked the same server to tell me about beef yakisoba, his reply was \" what do you want to know about it?\". Lastly tepanyaki entrees on the menue state they come with soup and salad. We received neither. The actual tepan chef did ok. Whether or not everything was fresh is questionable. End of the day atmosphere was poor, dated and disorganized. Service was awful, owner clueless, and the server was a complete joke. Absolutely will not ever return and recommend you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My first time to this place yesterday for early dinner. It is what it is. Unpretentious sushi. Unlike other reviews the ratio of rice to other ingredients were as they should be. Also unlike other reviews, the rolls were tightly made so nothing falling apart. Maybe it's all in who makes them. Ours were made by one of the owners. The ones we ordered were the Volcano, Rainbow, Ninja 1, Las Vegas, and Shrimp Tempura Roll. I would order all again except for the Volcano as it is a hot/cooked roll and did not particularly like the texture and temperature. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This is the second time to visit this place and I gave them 5 star... first of besides the friendly staff, fast, accomodating services the place is clean, good ambience and we have met the owner Don, they made sure that everything is ok and we'll taken care of. The food was excellent, we had the California Roll sushi and I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was the best! Filled up my hungry cravings and I was very satisfied. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good Japanese food, they also have the tepenyaki where you enjoy the show and great food with affordable prices! I will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Here is the deal with this place. I go here about 3 times a month. It's owned by a small korean family. the rolls are average per most sushi joints. But the fish here is by far fresher then anything at RA, Kona, or Sakitini. for 21.95 at lunch and 24.95 at dinner its all you can eat. They do use a little more rice than most other places unless you are a regular. For better service, better portions become a regular here and make yourself known with the chefs. I like places like Kona, RA , Sakitini but when I get the bill I feel raped I usually rack up a $65-$90 at those places but here I can go more frequently and not have to shell out as mush cash. Don't expect this to be some upscale joint it's not its for average family's. Not for the Shi Shi peeps of the valley."}
{"text":"I have been to Ninja three times and it has been consistently good, but not great.  They have some great lunch deals with my favorite so far being the yakuniku, which was very good.  One of the people I was with had the chirashi bowl and he said it was good.  I have not been blown away, but the food is consistently good and very reasonably priced for lunch."}
{"text":"I got this app just because I wanna talk about this restaurant. We only drink 1 sip of the soup and decided to give up on this water mix up with salt kinda soup. We waited an hour for our orders when the restaurant was only 50% full. We ran away from the restaurant before an other hour of waiting. This is unbearable and wasted of time. We will never come back again.  Rate for O starts."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Ninjas for well over 10 years.  The show is similar to other places but its fine because we don't go for the show; we go for the food!!  There has not been a single time the food was not prepared correctly. It is consistently tasty!   It's always my first choice for every birthday dinner.  We go more often tlnow, with the Groupon offers they have."}
{"text":"If you like to be adventurous with your sushi selection, see if Tad is working the sushi bar, and ask him to whip you up something that isn't on the menu! He has a knack for flavor and unique combinations and has obvious experience in the industry! The waitress was a little unattentive, but I would go back for more of Tad's finest!"}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have ever had at any establishment. I have been a customer here for 12 years and it's sad to say I will never go back. What a shame. The good food does not do the service justice."}
{"text":"Their sushi is good, but I am writing this review based on their teppanyaki meals.  I have tried dozens of teppan places around the valley, but this one is the tastiest.  They will load up the garlic if you want(my fav) and cook up everything to the properly - never over-done the several times over the years I went there.

The prices are great for the amount and quality of food you get but I would suggest you step up to flavor and try the better cuts of meat and fish if you can afford it (filet and scallop FTW!).

Come for teppan with a empty stomach and when you aren't pressed for time.  Worth the money.

I would give it 4 1/2 because it does seem at times the service is lacking, but I just can't resist this place.  Yum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a Groupon for this place.  When we walked through the door we were greeted by a short lady that took one look at us and said in a rather disgusted voice, \"...you have Groupon?\"  A little taken back, since most businesses wouldn't greet you with that question, we sheepishly admitted to having a Groupon.  She then huffed as she grabbed a couple menus, walked over to the nearest waitress on the floor and said, \"...they have Groupon...\"  and then she sat us down at a table, dropped the menus in front of us, and as the waitress came over to talk to us the lady said it again, \"...they have Groupon...\"  as if Groupon were a disease.

Now, go ahead and judge us if you want, we had Groupon, but my understanding is that most businesses are making use of the Groupon to bring in business and hopefully generate return customers once we realize how fantastic the food and service is.  Ninja, on the other hand, seemed to be insulted that it took a GROUPON (shhhhhh....) to get us to walk through the front door.  

What I also decided was that perhaps, having been labeled as the GROUPON people, they may have given us yesterday's leftover sushi.  It was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, not to mention room temperature sushi at that, so... I really couldn't eat much of it as I had great fear of blood flukes by then.  My boyfriend, of course, ate everything because he's a man and has a stomach made of iron, but me?  I just had two Long Island Iced Teas and prayed the alcohol would kill any potential food poisoning I may have ingested.

In terms of ambiance, the place has most obviously been there for a while.  It had a nice welcoming musty odor to it, if you like that kind of thing.  And the tables and chairs may be vintage 1980 originals.  

The same lady that groused at us because we had GROUPON seemed to be friendly to what I assumed were her regulars (god bless their loyal bad sushi eating souls), so I imagine if you don't come in diseased with GROUPON you may possibly be served fresh sushi and be treated with respect, but I still think very little of this place and I will never give it a second try (Groupon or not).  I am a sushi fan (btw, there is a bad @ss sushi place off Ray and Dobson), and this place was an epic fail."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday last year. We called to make reservations because from what people said we thought it was going to be a busy place and we planned on doing the hibachi grill so we were sure we needed them. When we arrived....there was not a single person in the place, and they had already been open for a couple of hours. Not a good sign. We decided against the hibachi and just went for the all you can eat sushi, which didn't turn out to be any cheaper than just getting a couple rolls of sushi. The food wasn't that great. The service was ok. I wasn't impressed at all...probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service on \"all you can eat Sushi\".  Only got our initial order waited 30 minutes for second order which never came.  1st and last visit."}
{"text":"NInja is the best sushi in town! I love going here and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I love this place! Never disappointed by them."}
{"text":"New management? Please sucks now. We used to go here and I remember it being much better.

Not any better than refrigerated grocery store sushi, and overpriced at that. Here is a tip for your sushi chefs. Watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi. The sushi rice shouldn't be ICE COLD, nor should the Unagi (Which had a nice flavor of riverbed, not the usual toasted/grilled flavor you find at a respectable sushi restaurant) 

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"When I was first getting into sushi  I was trying place to place when my friend  brought me here and I fell in love with it instantly the sushi is amazing and so is th rest of there menu and the people are the highest quality.I have been going there for five years now I used to go once a week but I no longer live there very time I make a trip back to az no mater if its just a night I always make it back there and it never disappoints"}
{"text":"Did the all you can eat sushi, it was like they weren't even trying to make great sushi. Little fillings and lots of rice! Ordered the baked sushi and it was burnt sticking to the aluminum foil! Not planning on returning!"}
{"text":"I always like to try new restaurant. After reading Yelp with some mixed reviews, I went on and bought a Groupon $25 for $50 deal and thought it was a good deal. It was my bf and I first time at Ninja's. The place was empty, we were greeted by a very sweet waitress. The first thing I noticed was the chefs. I thought, well it's ok, not all Sushi restaurants have to have Japanese chefs to make it good. Does that make me a Sushi snob? : / The first thing our waitress ask if we have a Groupon. Why? Does that matter, I thought. I said yes and she gave us the menu. We look at it but nothing sounds appetizing. Is it a different menu cause we have a Groupon? We decided to order a lot just in case... I think I've ordered about 10 rolls, sushi, and sashimi, But when our food arrived, it didn't seem enough. Our waiter didn't tell us what was on the first plate. Then the second round, he just drop it off on our table and we have no idea what we'd got. The rolls were just medico, nothing fancy or tasty. I thought they were all bland. Felt like the foods were made from Sushi 101 cookbook. My bf loves sushi and can sit forever eating them, but by the third plate, he said he was done and wanted to get the rest home. I was very surprised when the bill came, it was over $100 without drinks. I gave our waiter our Groupon and it came down to $65. I felt like we were gypped cause I don't think we recieved all the food we've ordered. I look at the order sheet and some wasn't cross off. And we weren't even stuffed ( it doesn't take a lot for me ) Also, we have very little leftover. I would have check with our waiter but my bf didn't care for the rest of the food. He didn't enjoy them anyway. So when I thought about it all, I spent way more than I wanted too, just to try a new place and leftover I don't think neither of us would eat again. This is one reason why my bf don't like to sway away from our favorite place. With that, the amount  we spent we could have gone to our favorite place twice, that's what he said! :)
Needless to say, I won't be coming back. But if you're not a sushi snob and for $20 all you can eat sushi, this place might be for you."}
{"text":"The tapanyaki was phenomenal! Went with a small group in a whim and tried a few dishes. The calamari was perfectly cooked, tender not rubbery, and had none of the fishy aftertaste that a lot of restaurants have when they prepare it incorrectly. The filet mignon was a perfect medium, and unbelievably tender. The marinated steak (I forget the name of it) has a great balance of flavor between the sweet of the marinade and the spices they use to complement it. The service was friendly and didn't take too long, although the restaurant also was not very busy when we went. The tapanyaki chef was masterful, and his performance really made the experience worth recommending. The only drawback was that the food was fairly expensive, generally about $20 for a dish, and while normally that would be a considerable flaw for me, the quality of the food and the hreat display it comes with makes it more than worth it. I would absolutely recommend Ninja, and will definitely be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, been eating here for 7 years, the atmosphere is very welcoming, the service is above excellent, must try."}
{"text":"I was forced to come here, I must say to begin with. After I found out My niece's Birthday dinner was going to be here I checked it out with the Yelpers and found a lot of disappointing to downright awful reviews about this little corner strip mall Japanese restaurant. 
I hemmed and hawed a lot! I must say it was not half bad. We had the Teppanyaki which, it appears, most reviewers did not experience. 
To begin with, there were 9 of us filling up our Teppan table to the max. The room was clean with some typical Asian style decor strewn about. 
It was 5pm and the dining room was quiet still. A very nice woman took our drink order. She was very friendly and recognized my brother and a couple of other diners from our group. That was very nice of her. She made small chat with them and made them feel welcome. Very cool. She admitted that she did not make very good margaritas and just left it at that. She did not offer, really, that someone else could make them. Not so cool. I mean my grandma wanted to get her margarita on and she just said, \"Margarita-very-I make.\" Luckily for Grams, the other woman who brought my iced tea and my brother's Kieran's said she made excellent Margaritas. 
The menu was a little challenging for Grandma and I. Neither of us had done Teppanyaki before. With help we made our choices. I had safe terriyaki chicken and she ordered chow mien. The rest of the group ordered more adventurous fare even some sushi rolls. The edamame was very nice. My iced tea was refilled in a timely manner. 
the restaurant quickly became busy. Our dinner arrived promptly as well beginning with the soup. It definitely needed spicing up. Not my favorite. The salad came next, and while it looked like a cafeteria salad with it's iceberg lettuce and faux wood bowl, it was very flavorful. This was solely due to the powerful ginger dressing making even iceberg lettuce delicious. 
Then the real fun began. Our Teppan chef was great! he showed amazing skill and organization combined with artistry and showmanship. It was his flair and the taste of his works that truly made this dinner memorable- oh yeah then my grandma said, \"You need to lose some weight! You're getting FAT!\" I will not soon forget that! 
Thanks Grandma, have another Margie! 
Overall, Ninja was unexpectedly good. The service was genuine and friendly. The prices seemed fair and the Teppan show was truly amazing."}
{"text":"We've gone here a few times on the teppan side.  I've never had sushi here, but I did enjoy the teppan yaki food.  If you're going as a couple, the wait could be long before they get the food started because it seems they want to fill up the seats first.  So be patient if you're not filling up a table with a group.  I enjoy the fun of watching the food get cooked and if you're social, you can chat with the people at your table."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed.  

We live 100+ miles from this restaurant to the West (81 miles from Blythe CA).  Hubby had to go to Chandler for a doctor's appt.  I LOVE teppanyaki and sushi (have even eaten it at the Takasugi fish market in Tokyo where it is REALLY fresh). I saw the Groupon and thought I would go with him to Chandler. Where we live, I don't get to go out much unless I want a long drive. It was to be a fun, really special night as we were going to Glendale Glitters and Arizona lights on our way home.

Arrived about 6:35 last night.  They sat us immediately at one teppan grill, then moved us to another within 3 minutes.  We were by ourselves at both tables.  We ordered drinks, got our miso (which was very decent miso), got our salad. Also ordered the mixed tempura appetizer which was really good tempura. About 30 minutes had gone by since we arrived.  

In between the miso and the salad, the server asked if she could seat 5 others at our table.  I said NO.  I knew what the deal was-we would have to wait until they ordered, got their appetizers, miso, salad and THEN the teppan maestro would appear. I was hungry, we wanted to see the Xmas lights before they closed at 10PM AND we had a 2 hour drive home.

The server looked at me like I was a real b***.  I was serious, she didn't take it that way. She sat the 5 people with us anyhow. We were finished with our salads and wanted our main dishes.

After ANOTHER 20 minutes, she started bringing out the other 5 people's miso, then the salad.  By now we had been there over an hour.

FINALLY, the teppan maestro appeared.  I wasn't hungry anymore.  Husband ate the rib eye and vegetables.  I cancelled my order.  Why bother eating-I wasn't that hungry now and I really wanted to see the Xmas lights.

The owner/manager tried everything to make us happy.  For that I was grateful.  But my time had been totally wasted and I wanted to see the Xmas lights and then get home.  

This is my perspective. I own an international logistics company,  travel the world in pursuit of my business and have had teppan in world renowed places worldwide.  The NORMAL procedure is either keep a couple at the bar or sushi bar for XXX time (usually no more than 30 minutes), then seat them with another group that is also at the same place in the ordering process. OR take reservations for SPECIFIC times which make the teppan tables full. OR if there are only two or three, then FEED them after they have ordered, had their \"starters\" and have enough teppan chefs to feed even small groups.  None of that happened last night.  I can only attribute that to poor management.

In Peru, which has a lot of VERY good Japanese restaurants, they have small teppan tables for 2-4.  NO ONE waits.  There are enough teppan chefs to feed everyone, even in small groups. The knife flying thing may not be as fancy as some places but the cooking is certainly as good.

My husband's food was decent-I had a few bites of his steak and some of the vegetables.  We were there until 8:17.  If I wanted a 2 hour dinner, I would go on another cruise on formal night.

We got to Glendale Glitters after the carriage rides were done.  Arizona lights was closed when we got there.  So no Christmas lights for me.

The manager/owner insisted she comp our bill.  She kept insisting we keep the Groupon and come back.  I have no reason to drive 100+ miles to Chandler again unless hubby has to go back to the pain doctor.  So we won't be back any time soon.

Really really disappointed in the POOR management of the tappan tables.  They could do CONSIDERABLY better as restaurants worldwide do."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST tempanyaki I have EVER had, beats all the chain restaurants by FAR! Victor is the best haha, you just have to go and find out. They are always accommodating for our lively group (usually drinking). Great place for birthdays. I'm not sure about their sushi, I have tried a couple rolls that weren't bad but I just can't get enough chicken teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Normally I eat sushi on the sushi side. Tonight I dined teppanyaki. Very flavorful chicken and crisp veggies. 
Shrimp were ok.

The show was ok, but not as good as bigger city restaurants. 
Very basic. 
But if it is your first teppanyaki visit, it will seem outstanding.

Used a groupon special which saved quite a bit, only complaint. If you plan on buying alcohol buy the higher priced groupon. It will save you way more in the long run. 
All In all still a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Horrible place,  Bad food and nasty manager"}
{"text":"First try, 30 minute wait to get seated then an hour afterwards waiting on the cook before we walked out (hibachi area nearly empty).  Benefit of the doubt, tried it again a month later. 15 minutes to get seated (again, nearly empty hibachi area), another 30 waiting on the cook after ordering.  Finally served, the chicken was rubbery and the shrimp was overcooked (only good thing was the fried rice).  Desert was icecream with petrified lettuce stuck to the spoon.  Enjoy the $86 bill for the two of us Ninja, we will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I won't be returning here. I went with my boyfriend on a Thursday night. It wasn't crowded at all, so our server only had a few tables, not a bad atmosphere (only the sushi area was open, so pretty quiet).

We ordered the $22 all you can eat sushi. It seems like a good deal, but it actually turns out not to be, plus you have to eat everything you order.

Our waitress was nice, but very odd, and her service was not great (she grabbed a pen from my hand while I was using it, pretty rude in general). We had to flag her down anytime we needed something even though it was very slow and she was passing by us often. 

The sushi itself was mediocre at best - not much flavor, which is a shame since the menu looked good. Lastly, the bathrooms were very gross and extremely dark - not very reassuring in a restaurant. 

Overall, not a good experience when there are plenty of other sushi places to try around here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love going here. 

my friends and I love coming here for $20 all you can eat sushi... 
I have never been disappointed. the staff is wonderful and the good is great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy the Japanese Sushi Bar atmosphere at the Ninja.  If you are a sushi fanatic you will love the All You Can Eat Special!  My current sushi favorite is the Volcano Roll which is a spicy hot salmon.  We have also had friends join us at one of the seven Teppanyaki grills.  The cooks put on a great show and there is a family party atmosphere that we all enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here with a groupon and was disappointed to find you could not use it to purchase the all you can eat sushi.  Overall, the sushi was pretty good, but not great.  All in all, I'd say it was a decent value and probably a good place to go when you want a lot of sushi at a good price.  If you are looking for quality over quantity, you could probably do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love love this place!  I think it is way better than Ra and all the other named brand places!  The service is great and the people are nice! Steve the sushi chef is the best there!  LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"What I thought was decent upon the first visit, had somehow morphed into mediocre and in some cases, disgusting. What the heck happened?

I agree with the other reviewers about the ratio of rice to fish- its ridiculous how much rice they cram into their nigiri. 

We did do the all you can eat sushi deal, and I was totally taken aback by the waitress's admonition that we will get charged for what we don't eat. Excuse me? We didn't order extravagantly, and I doubt what we got would have totaled the $20 charge for the AYCE. 

Anyway, the sushi itself was about as flavorful as a ten dollar bill. I love eel, and they managed to screw up the eel so badly that it tasted like cardboard and had the texture of dry, severely overcooked fish. The yellowtail sashimi just didn't taste right, and I paid for that one for the rest of the night. Ouch. 

Ah well. At least the sake is cheap and good."}
{"text":"This place seems old and outdated.
But sushi is good, yes good not great.
service was decent.
the problem that I had was the tables are too close together, you cant enjoy a meal with your family because its too crowded and noisy.

If you want to enjoy a meal and conversation don't eat here."}
{"text":"Paper think sushi, why do they think we wouldn't realize this, unreal. Purchased 20 for 40 Groupon,  stay away, not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. This is my first bad review of a place on yelp, but I want to make sure nobody else goes there. Not because I'm a hater, but because the food is terrible and I don't want anybody else wasting they're hard earned cash on this place. Sorry folks, it's AZ, just go to RA or Kona."}
{"text":"I had my doubts based on previous reviews, but I'm glad we came. The dinner was great. The best Filet I have had at a teppanyaki place in Phoenix.

Will return."}
{"text":"Amazing quality sushi and nagiri rolls. For a restaurant that offers $20 all you can eat mon thru fri, they have well over 30+ rolls to choose from and they are all prepared fresh, if you sit at the bar you can even watch the chefs prepare it in front of you which I enjoy doing. Wide variety of drink options both alcoholic and non-alcoholic as well as soups and other entrees to choose from. Prices outside of all you can eat days are very reasonable as well considering the amount of options you have to choose from and the fresh quality ingredients. Will return regularly as they have some of the friendliest and funny waiters and waitresses on staff. Great job Ninja!! Posted March 12th 2015."}
{"text":"Good teppan food at normal prices.  I do love the cozy atmosphere.  We did not try sushi which is supposed to be awesome.  The prices on that looked to be very good.  They even have an all you can eat sushi deal for 19.99.  I would say give this place a try.  Groupon brought us here and wife and will go back for sushi."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here. The teppanyaki tables are great and food is always delicious. The chef keeps everyone entertained and engaged.
Would recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"The sushi was terrible and over priced. The chicken terriaky was the worst quality I've ever seen. I went during lunch and there was only one chef and one waitress we had to pay for rolls we didn't get until we were almost put the door so we're in no mood to eat. Terrible experience and a lot of money"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! It's a bad sign when it's dead and it takes forever to get your food! ....seriously as I was typing this waiting for my check (that I had to ask for) they just brought out a 4th roll they had obviously forgotten! One roll had brown old avacado on it--that's a simple enough thing that should NEVER happen! They were very pushy that we do all you can eat- we didn't and they seemed upset by that! We won't be back! This was your warning! ---have it a two star but changed to 1 after the high bill with bad service and bad food :("}
{"text":"When we decided to get the recent Groupon, I have to admit I was wary.  As per ushe, I checked in with Yelp.  The reviews here are so contradictory, I didn't know what to expect.  Since I'm far from a sushi snob (if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, we're good!) I figured there was little to lose.  I was pleasantly surprised with the experience.

To start off, it was a little hard to find.  I was in the right parking lot, but literally watched the red dot on my phone map and drove around trying to line it up with the green one.  Finally found it.  The atmosphere inside was nice, it wasn't very busy so it was pretty relaxed.  Very Japanese decor.  We were seated immediately, and water came pretty quickly.

My one complaint of the evening was the long wait between getting the water and getting the menu.  When the waitress (who was very polite) brought them over, she explained that we could not get all-you-can-eat with our Groupon (sensible) but explained what it entailed for next time.  We ordered 6 or 7 rolls, 6 of which were very tasty.  The 7th...the Volcano Roll... was pretty weird.  It was spicy (not necessarily bad), sea-foody, and seemed to have been fired.  The flavor just wasn't what one expects with sushi.  The Arizona and Vegas rolls were great and the others were pretty good.

The total bill was very reasonable for 4 people for Sushi.  Take off the Groupon, and we got out for about $5 each.  If I go back with a big appetite, I'll definitely try the all-you-can-eat menu for $20.  And when I say \"if\", I mean \"when\"."}
{"text":"This is the best teppan grill that I have eaten at in the easy valley.   The chefs are very good and the food is better than any other in the area.   The only negative is the wait staff.  He was pretty good,  but there should have been more than one."}
{"text":"One of my favorite AYCE sushi places. They have a great al el carte option too. I wish they would just upgrade the inside a bit bc it's way out dated. But their sushi is good and so is the service."}
{"text":"I was invited to a lunch meeting here and  was very pleased with the quality of the food. We all had the all you can eat sushi and we all loved it.  Very good service and quality management.  Can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch and did the hibachi grill. We had Veronica, the food was fabulous and she was very friendly and inviting! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute inside. The server was very friendly, and attentive. My girlfriend had a food allergy and made sure he overlooked everything we ordered two make nothing would give her an issues. Food was amazing. I can't remember the rolls we got but they were delicious. Over all I will be returning, and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi!!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi spot. Nice staff and wonderful food. T"}
{"text":"i have been going this place now almost 20 years plus.  great food good people what more can u ask for...."}
{"text":"We stopped in for what we thought would be a somewhat quick bite while we were out shopping.  We were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant and ordered only 3 rolls.  It took 35 mins to get just 1 roll!!  Two of the rolls were just \"eh\". We liked the New Mexican roll. 

Husband used the bathroom and said the door was covered in \"gang tags\" and no paper towels.  

We can definitely tell the originals owners are no longer around."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi / japanese food 
in town beats RA and benihanas!! Can't get enough! My boyfriend is addicted, we definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"We've eaten several times at Ninja, a couple using a Groupon. I prefer not to use Groupon though as they have a large selection of \"all you can eat\" sushi for $20 (which you can't use the groupon towards). It's not the worlds best sushi but it is good and a great deal for the price. We have not tried the teppan side but it's always packed. The service has been slightly slow but decent. I'd say it's somewhat kid friendly because, while there are no coloring books they do have kid entrees. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the single worst Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. The salad and miso soup were inedible, extremely salty. The teppaniyaki was just okay, not worth the price. 

To top it all off, the manager yelled at me over the terms of the Groupon we paid with, and then walked off swearing under his breath, extremely unprofessional. There were only two full tables in the restaurant and it took my party of four forty minutes to get our food. 

Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Ninja. A true Heaven on Earth! All you can eat sushi for $22? Yes, please! My wife and I dine at Ninja about once a month. The staff are incredibly friendly, the dining area is always clean, the sushi is absolutely delicious and the pricing is awesome for all you can eat. I often order the Hipster roll, the Boston roll and the Gringo roll. Phenomenal food. I highly recommend Ninja for the sushi whore in you. There are tons of rolls to choose from and not a one is disappointing. Get ya some!"}
{"text":"Last visit the visit was subpar. Service was subpar & super slow. We were the 3rd table, only ordered 3 things from the sushi menu & a hot green tea, & it took over 30+ min to get our items. 
I don't think I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"this is the worst place ever for reservations. 7 reservation, 9 still no food. absolutely ridiculous. food is not worth that wait. do not come here ever !   -10 rating"}
{"text":"We showed up to this place and it just looked dirty. The service there does not exist and the restaurant was dirty. We ended up leaving because the whole experience was awful. There was a ton of food bits on other tables and grime in between the grill and the table. The price was high and it did not seem worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to ninja for years we've always enjoyed the service and the food, today I came by myself for a beer and a couple of quick rolls. and was completely turned away at the door and told there was no availability for one person. All the sushi bars were completely empty, all of the tables except for two were completely empty and the girl looked at me and told me sorry we can't accommodate one... I'll never return to this place again!!!  bye Ninja!!!!"}
{"text":"Ninja is a bit secluded, but I guess that's what makes it a great find. The inside setting reminds me of something I would find back home in California - nothing too fancy and very neighborhood-like.

The servers are all nice, but the food is mediocre. I do like the chicken skewers though. The sushi is alright - not as authentic as other places (but then again, can you really get authentic sushi in the West? ;-) ) and the prices are a little high, but one thing that I thought was professional was that they put a notice outside apologizing for the raise in prices due to the economy, so you know that you'll be paying a bit more. Definitely a nice gesture and honesty on their part/"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant more than several times, and the food and staff continue to be amazing! The chef at the hibachi table was fun and did new moves that I haven't seen before. The all you can eat sushi had sooooo many varieties of rolls and more! The staff are unbelievably nice and fun. If you become a regular, you get to pick your own chopsticks and a box to keep them at the restaurant. Overall, always a great experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Their vegetarian sushi options are PLENTIFUL, super YUMMY, fairly priced. A very fun, relaxing atmosphere. They were pretty busy when we went, so we waited a bit longer than I would have preferred to order our food (also, we went in there super hangry in the first place) BUT, WELL WORTH THE WAIT!"}
{"text":"I go here once or twice a month. Best sushi in the valley hands down. Little bit expensive but totally worth the money"}
{"text":"Great food. Experienced chefs and creative menu. Fun people and good service. Why must I write more than that?"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Japanese restaurant at which I have eaten in the Valley.  First, there is no pork whatsoever on the menu, meaning that classic dishes like katsu donburi and tonkatsu are unavailable.  The yakisoba was served swimming in a sweet sauce that missed the point of being fried (yaki) noodles.  The tempura was good and the sushi was OK, for the Valley.  Overall, this is a restaurant that purports to be Japanese but seems to have no one of Japanese descent, or even knowledge, anywhere around."}
{"text":"I had my 1st experience at Ninja last night after a co-worker recommended it... The place was busy, but not packed & there was no wait. There were 3 of us & we ordered 5 rolls to start off with... 1-1.5 hours later our 1st roll came out! Completely unacceptable!!! Right before that 1st roll (which was devoured in a minute between 3 people), our waitress finally realized how long we had been waiting & offered us some edamame because of the wait. There were a couple of large tables doing the all-you-can-eat sushi that seemed to get the preferential treatment. 

Onto the sushi...
Tempura Calamari Roll - bland w/ lots of rice
Spicy Salmon Roll - decent, but a little bland
Las Vegas Roll - not the best I've had, but good.
20 Mile Roll - Very good, probably because it's slathered in sauces for flavor.
Baked Scallop Roll - Delicious... although I could just eat the scallop & crabmeat topping all night.

I'll probably give this place another chance to see if there service gets any better, probably for happy hour because they had a decent happy hour menu... maybe 12-15 items (rolls & apps) in the $3-4 range."}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing, even with one server. I highly recommend the Chirashi. They do have a bar and pour strong drinks. Enjoyed my experience, will go back. The bathroom is in serious need of an update and lighting."}
{"text":"Not bad food but both times I have eaten there we were forced out by the loud techno music"}
{"text":"Awesome! I've only been here twice but it was delicious and I couldn't ask for anything more for $20 all you can eat. Service was friendly and timely both times I've been. If you're looking for top notch sushi probably not the place for you bouji sushi eaters lol but if you're looking for fresh food and cheap this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the place to go if you want exceptional service and a fine-dining experience. However, if you want great sushi, then it definitely the right place! We get the all you can eat every time and it has never failed us. It's just such a good value for eating tons and tons of sushi, which is the whole point of going there! We go every every week and spread the word as much as possible."}
{"text":"Came here one night with some friends after we discovered Szechwan Palace was already closed for the night. Ninja was the only other place open within that same mall. No big deal - I wanted some Teppanyaki. When we walked in, they tried to seat us on the sushi side but since we wanted Teppanyaki, we were told to wait while they cleaned up one of the tables. Then the server led us to a Teppanyaki table and we sat down around it. I ordered a small Kirin. I also ordered the yakiniku as my main entree. There were four of us around the table in my group and the server brought in two more people (a couple) and asked if they could join our table. We were fine with it so he went on with the show. The server put on quite a show - spinning and twirling knives right in front of our faces. Wait - I don't remember signing a waiver! Hope he wasn't drinking earlier! So after that he chopped up the meats and did all sorts of hocus pocus and alchemy with sauces and lit flaming fires here and there. He did this one thing he called a \"volcano\" which was onions sliced up and arranged from large rings to small in the shape of a volcano. He lit that sucker up and it went whoosh - singed my nose hairs while I took pictures. He then neatly stacked up all the meats and vegetables and put it on our plates one by one. The show was over. We sat and ate for a bit - our rice actually came pretty late - timing was a little off. So while we gorged on meats and rice the table next to us started getting a little rowdy. Lots and I mean LOTS of alcohol was flowing and there were about 14 folks at the other table. It was somebody's 30-something birthday and somebody even came over with a gong and banged it loud and often enough for me to want to start throwing the teppanyaki items my dining companions couldn't finish at him. I thought their behavior was kinda obnoxious but it's a Saturday night and people party so what the hey? However, the couple that was sitting at our same table couldn't handle it and the man left to pay and leave. This was when the second \"show\" began. The woman stayed behind and started shouting back to all the yelling from the other table. I was half expecting a full-on bar fight with ZZ Top soundtrack and all but this was at a Teppanyaki place with mature adults that although inebriated seemed more or less cultured. About this point I realized that our tablemate was thoroughly and completely toasted. She continued to engage the other table with insults and mockery - this went on for a while. A while later her man came back and sat down frustrated that his drunken gal pal did not leave with him when he paid. Then the other party started to leave and as they did, each female member of the party stopped to face drunken woman and made some comment about kicking drunken woman's arse. One of them looked like she was ready to go right then and there. Drunken woman started raging about how she had 2 assault charges against her and how she wasn't afraid of going to jail again and how it was gonna be just her against 7 bitches and she would kick all their collective asses using some ancient art of bitch fu she learned in Apache Junction. LOL. I figured the women might wait for her outside the restaurant and settle it old school style. Or at least high school style. But there were no sirens going or cop cars waiting in the parking lot as we left the restaurant about ten minutes later. Just as well. That was way more entertainment than I expected. I shoulda known, though. After all, the place is called Ninja Restaurant! Coincidence? Methinks no. Service was more or less decent for how crowded it was. Clientele? A bit rowdy on the Teppanyaki side but a lot more mellow on the sushi side. Your mileage may vary of course. Place is in the same mall as Szechwan Garden and the new Ploy Thai Bistro which took over where T-Spot Ramen used to be. On Alma School halfway between Warner and Elliot on the west side. It's a mall. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Home of the $20 all u can eat rice with a garnish of raw fish. The hand rolls are laughable: they are huge, and look like black skinned larvae engorged with crunchy rice.

The rice in the Nigiri and rolls was the worst I've tasted at any Japanese restaurant. Hard and flavorless, it was utterly unacceptable. Tasted like there was no vinegar or seasoning whatsoever.

The waitresses run around like rush hour traffic, bumping into each other and the teppan cooks. 

The place was packed, which was unbelievable. Life's too short to eat bad sushi, people!!

Caveat Emptor."}
{"text":"Love me some Ninja! Get the Ninja roll and the Lollipop! Don't forget to grab the baked scallop or creamy garlic rolls. Holy deliciousness!

This is my all time favorite sushi spot. The wait staff are amazing and the food it delicous. I would be considered a regular here if I didn't live on the north side of Phoenix. I have been going to Ninja since I moved to Arizona in 2004."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi restaurant when I'm craving it. They have an all-you-can-eat section which makes it great for a first time sushi eater to explore what tastes they are into. That's what my boyfriend and I get. We usually sit with Dominic he makes great rolls and honestly the food tastes better when he makes it. They have fresh wasabi that is amazing you get plenty of it to share for two. 

The spider roll is my favorite and the philly roll is my boyfriends favorite. We enjoy their nigiri selection before and after our rolls. 

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good sushi and at a great price! 

The tempura platter has a great variety of vegetables and a pineapple lol. I honestly can't say anything bad about this place even if I tried."}
{"text":"How can I even start with this spot...
Hands down, one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the valley. 
It is worth the drive, every time!!

In my opinion, if you are a big eater, best way to go is the \"all you can eat\" menu. Everything is made right on the spot, so you can be confident that everything you eat is fresh.

On the other side of the sushi bar, they have tables with teriyaki chefs, cooking in front of you.

Sake bombers and green tea are my top beverages. (Obviously not at the same time)

Staff is super friendly!

Cozy with a fantastic ambience. 

PD. They have karaoke on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Had sushi and Teppanyaki with my family.  The best sushi I had was the rock and roll sushi.  Very tasty.  Service was good.  Teppanyaki show was good.  Huge veggie portions and good variety of vegetables.  I really liked that.  We had steak, chicken, and shrimp plates.  All were enjoyed and I got the leftovers. Also tried the tempura plate.  Lots of food and nice crisp tempura.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"Ninja has become, as of May 2012, the frequent haunt of my fianc√© and I, and I probably should have posted this review looooong before now. However, I've also now experienced Ninja on pretty much every kind of night, so hopefully I'll be able to write a better overall review. Or at least a longer one. haha!

To begin, my fianc√© and I are drawn back again and again not only by the delicious offerings on their AYCE sushi menu (which they have recently updated to include a few more options), but also by the incredibly welcoming and always-helpful chefs and wait-staff. We now know everyone who works there by name, and I'm excited to go back to Ninja on our sushi nights not only because it's freaking yummy but because I'm excited to see everyone again!

I'm actually very confused by all the negative reviews for Ninja on this site. I'm not going to deny that it gets incredibly busy on Friday (and some Saturday) nights lately, most likely due to the sale of an incredible number of Groupons, and that service slows down as a consequence. That IS a fact. However, the people that work here are hardly at fault for the fact that the majority of their customer traffic is concentrated on one or two nights per week. :P The last few Fridays, every single table in the place has been filled up at dinner time, with more and more people lining up at the door, and there are so many sushi menus stretched across the LOOOONG sushi bar that, once spread out, they need to be layered if they're gonna fit. Yes, it gets crazy, but the servers and the chefs really are working as fast as they can. Conversely, on week nights, the place is DEAD. 

As an additional note, my fianc√© and I bring our own chopsticks when we come, and this is the first place where our waitress has ever washed them for us!

oh, and another warning to keep in mind: sometimes the music does get a bit loud. However, if you express displeasure to a server, they're always prompt and ready to turn down the volume. My impression has always been that they honestly care about their customers, and they truly want them to be happy and comfortable.

I've eaten a LOT of sushi in my time, and my fella and I have prowled loads of establishments in the Phoenix area, in Tucson, and in Washington state, and Ninja honestly reigns supreme. We've loved a couple enough to become regulars, but we honestly don't care to go anywhere but Ninja anymore. Tried polyamory and failed. Oh Ninja, you make an honest woman out of me. 

On the topic of the food, nigiri is my personal weakness, and the nigiri here at Ninja is exceptional. The amount of rice that they use is quite conservative, with a proportionally generous slice of melt-in-your-mouth sashimi on top. Further, the pieces are quite dainty compared to what I've been served elsewhere, which makes eating them a much more pleasant experience. And their albacore... They serve their albacore like I've never had it before, topped with minced garlic, scallions, and a light drizzle of ponzu sauce. It's absolutely spectacular, and you MUST order it if you go.

As for maki, if you like spicy or fried, my fianc√© swears by the calamari tempura roll. According to him, the spicy sauce is an amazing complement to the overall flavour, and MUCH better than the stuff we've been served at other restaurants. As for myself, my personal favourites are the rainbow roll and the alaskan roll (the latter is one that has been recently added to the AYCE menu, and is basically a california roll topped with salmon, masago, scallions, and ponzu). I personally order it sans masago. 

Speaking of ordering things special, the chefs and wait staff have always been incredibly accommodating when it comes to removing certain ingredients from the rolls. To cite an extreme example, I really enjoy salmon and avocado rolls, but there is unfortunately no such roll offered at Ninja. However, those ARE the ingredients in a Philly roll if you remove the cream cheese, so that's just what I do. It's a little ridiculous because a Philly roll gets its name from the cream cheese, but it doesn't matter: the staff at Ninja are happy to bend the laws of the universe for my sake, and I get my Philly roll without the Philly whenever I go. ;)

We've brought scads of friends with us to dinner here, and everyone becomes an instant convert and starts bringing THEIR family and THEIR friends. Sure, I might be a bit biased in their favour, but I'm biased for a reason: they've earned my loyalty, over and over again. And besides that, AYCE sushi for $20 is a flipping AMAZING deal -- especially when you consider the quality that Ninja delivers. You don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity in this case.

Can you see why I'm surprised that so many people have had unhappy experiences at Ninja? I really don't get it."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden treasure in Chandler!!  The food was absolutely delicious. The waiter and chef went out of thier way to make the entire experience one to remember. One of our guests is allergic to soy and they were more than accommodating. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 we because I used a 2 for $19 Groupon and they scanned it first and then a friend happened to be in the area and joined us.  I told my friend about the Groupon but the waiter said they could only have one Groupon per table. I then aske if we could use the 4 for $60 Groupon. The waiter called the owner and said we could not. The waiter was honestly apologetic.  Had the owner been more accomadating I would have definitely given 5 stars.  The food and service was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Ninja regularly and for the price, it can't be beat.  Ninja doesn't have the best sushi in the East valley (Sushi Eye in Tempe is better), but it's a great place to go for the all-you-can-eat sushi.  $20 will get you endless sushi and a bowl of miso soup, and the quality of everything is good.  The rolls are all tasty, and the nigiri is good (although, again, it's not mind-blowing).  I go there with large groups of friends and we all go with all-you-can-eat and literally sit there eating and talking for a solid 3 hours.  They keep bringing out the food and have never been upset that we stay there all night.  The one thing to be warned of is don't order anything you can't eat - you get charged extra for anything you don't finish.  However, since you can order over and over and over again, this isn't a big deal.  Just make a bunch of small orders so you can be sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews? 

I'm Asian, have a pregnant white girlfriend and we love this place. VERY good service, respectful of Groupon deal. Chill atmosphere and casual. They play indie Electronica in the background at  relatively low volume making the experience pretty good. 

Decor is wonderful, the lights or a mixture of red, blue and white. 

Will add more to this review later."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Ninja for sushi with friends.  I am not a big sushi fan and was a little scared from the reviews but I was plesently surprised.  Maybe the people who wrote the review were drunk on Sake.  the service was fine the sushi was great and in a timely manner for sushi, I would say the resaurant was a quarter full. l will be going back with more friends...."}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks. Ninja has a great selection of sake and Asian beers. They also have a phenomenal selection of traditional and modern sushi...the Teppan food is great as well, I recommend the filet"}
{"text":"Good sushi and great main dishes. They have a Teppanyaki area as well that looks great. We used a living social coupon that helped reduce the $30.00 ticket to 14.00.

So great value. Just a bit slow.

Also try the red bean ice cream its wonderful."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place hands down. I love the all you can eat, it has a very large selection. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Ninja is my favorite sushi place in the east valley.  I've been going here since I moved to Gilbert in 2006 and my boyfriend, a Tempe native, has been going here since the early '90's and we have NEVER been disappointed.

Excellent sushi, new menus often, and a staff that wants to please at Ninja!  Special rolls are made on request, and often not by request - they just appear at your table!  I've introduced quite a few friends to Ninja and they keep coming back on their own.  

A great place for a party or for a newbie trying sushi for the first time."}
{"text":"All you can eat Sushi was great, not to mention Sake bombers."}
{"text":"Ninja is our favorite sushi place, always fresh and lots of choices on the all you can eat menu. We are always full and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great all you can eat prices, overall an outstanding place!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I love these people!!
the $20 all you can eat is hard to beat!!

They are so nice and have only once had a problem with service (the person was new)."}
{"text":"Sad!! The talent and creativity of their sushi chefs is unfortunately trumped by the horrific customer service due to lousy wait staff. The rolls here are creative, fresh, funky (sometimes too funky, i've had a weird choice or two that i would not choose again) and overall pretty good. But if their paying customers continue to be neglected during their visits they will inevitably fall due to low scoring reviews. My review score is based solely on the horrible service provided by their waitress last week."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was for my friend's birthday party on the weekend. LOTS of people were here. The waitresses were so very nice! It did take awhile for our food to come out, but I'm assuming thats because we ordered 45405348347598454 rolls... Between the sake bombers and overdosing on eel rolls, I can't really remember if the service was exceptional.. all I can say is that I didn't get sick so that has to say a lot :D"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time but they got rid of their best sushi chef Steve. Now many of the rolls have cream cheese? What kind of sushi is that? Oscar is a great teppan Yaki chef and Mimi is very nice but the sushi has lost its luster in the last 2 years."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely atrocious. Tonight I got there at 7:10 and got seated right away. 20 minutes later, got my drink. 10 minutes later, placed my order. 10 minutes later, got soup. 10 minutes later, got the salad. At that point I asked them when they would start cooking, he said after the other table, who had just started getting their dinner cooked, was done. 50 minutes there, then they say we were still 20-30 minutes away from actually eating. I've done all you can eat sushi there once before, and they only have the ability to make 3 rolls an hour, per table. Worst service I have ever experienced at ANY restaurant"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and was more than impressed. The atmosphere was hip and inviting. The staff there was friendly, especially Don behind the Sushi Bar. The Sushi was the best I've ever had and I look forward to when I can go back. Ninja!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to ninja for many years and it's always a great time. Our cooks know is by name and make the experience for our kids one to remember. Food is great and owner is the best."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant I've had so far. The workers here are up beat and friendly. It's a small restaurant but the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a half or no star. But I have to make this dumb joke Bush said once (not verbatim): \"fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, I'm doubly shamed\". Hahaha 
Anyway, my experience was almost the same as past. We got our orders in: chicken and sirloin steak teppan dinners. And ordered some sushi. The chef Oscar was good and seemed to know what he was doing. Very entertaining with onion volcano. The main food he cooked was tasty. But the soup that we waited 26 minutes for was cold, cloudy and salty than usual miso soup. The salad was iceburg that had plopped spoonful of ginger dressing on top.  Fried rice was okay, although we were charged $2.00 each more which is a bit ridiculous. There was only ONE server and ONE teppan chef. The wait for everything was long and uneccessary. I gave this place a try again 3 years later than my original visit. Sadly....jokes on me. The only upgrade was that that took out the crusty food drenched carpet in teppen area and replaced it with lament flooring. So I was hopeful. But overall. ....do not go."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here at all. The waiting was more than an hour and we didn't even bother to wait cuz it's not worth the waiting. The starter soup was too salty and the salad gave my friend a diarrhea. It's not even legit Japanese food. I only see American people preparing and serving the food. I just left some tips and left with an empty stomach after an hour waiting. The server was actually nice tho"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my parents and niece. Since we were the only customers in the restaurant, the waiter was very attentive to our order and kept checking on us to see if we were ready.

Our appetizer order of spring rolls and edamame came out really fast. The spring rolls were veggie and had some thin glass noodles in it, which was a nice surprise. The edamame was decently warm and salted.

The rolls came out not too long after. We ordered the spicy tuna, Las Vegas, shrimp tempura and California rolls. Out of all of the rolls, I liked the Las Vegas roll best. The quality of fish was decent for being in the desert. The shrimp tempura roll came with this sauce, which I thought was spicy mayo, but it tasted more like mayo mixed with ketchup...not a big fan of that sauce on sushi. You can't really mess up spicy tuna, which was a good amount of spice.

My mom also ordered shrimp Yakisoba. It was pretty oily and didn't have many vegetables at all. There was a good amount of small shrimp, but the only vegetables in the noodle dish were lots of carrot slices and a few pieces of cabbage.

They do offer an all you can eat sushi option for about $21 per person. Sounds enticing, but not sure if I'd try their sushi again. There is also the option for teppanyaki, where they cook on a flat top in front of you, so that might be an option to come back and try the place out again."}
{"text":"I have been to Ninja many times, and both my wife and I agree, this is some of the best priced, and best overall sushi in the east valley.

Ninja doesn't have the flair of Blue Wasabi, or Ra. But its good food, made by real Sushi Chef's from Japan.


It is your typical-older-dive sushi joint, don't go in expecting anymore then that."}
{"text":"Its funny how all-you-can-eat Sushi can sound so amazing when you just hiked 6 miles and are completely starving. 20 sashimis later, your perspective starts to change a bit.

The main problem with Ninja isn't its sushi, its people's expectation of the sushi. Price is a key setter of expectations, so if you are paying $19.99 for all the sushi (AND sashimi) your hungry little stomach can provide, maybe you shouldn't be expecting the fish to taste like it just got sliced off the coast of japan by Shiro himself.

That being said, 3 stars is an evening of satisfaction without completely flipping about the amazingness of the food. The price/food ratio is amazing, the service is good and the food itself is very decent. I was not fond of the volcano rolls but my friends swear by it. The classic philly, salmon and spicy tuna rolls were prepared well and some of their more inventive rolls (like the spicy New Mexico) were interesting and worth trying. 

My favorite part about all-you-can-eat at Ninja is when the server starts coming around to see if we want to order more... smiling hard because she can obviously see in our faces the look of defeat and gluttony. As we stare at the leftover rolls on the plate, we become incredibly strategic about our every move. \"Okay man, you eat that one, I will eat this one over here and he can have those 2 because he ate less overall.\" \"No man, I can't do the spicy one. I will trade you if I can poke the cucumber out\" \"Fine. Deal\" *Gulp*. Ah, all done."}
{"text":"The worse restaurant I have been to!
The food took over two hours, the service staff pretty much ignored us and many other tables had been waiting a long time too! We went with a Groupon and was treated like we were sub-par. At the end, we just got a bill that had a few numbers and a grand total on it, probably because they knew we had a Groupon and wanted to up charge everything. I was so fed up by this point, I didn't argue. There were several other tables that left in the middle of their dinner because the food was taking too long. My husband is a Chef and would never say a restaurant is 'terrible' but he sure did when we went to this place. Don't go, and don't buy Groupons, you get treated differently!"}
{"text":"We had a really good time. Victor our cook was fun and out on a great show! The food was delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love this place and Andy is the bomb!
Always good but our sushi chef Andy went above and beyond to make our last experience even better. He recommended and added suggestions that put his sushi over the top, we'll definitely come back just to see what else he has in his pocket!"}
{"text":"Tepanyaki Chef Victor had excellent showmanship, great customer interaction and excellent flavor to his food. Drink refills didn't happen till the end of dinner and it took a bit long to get the check. Over all great service. Restaurant needs better air flow, it was a bit stuffy and dark but Victor made up for all of that."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews my friends and I were skeptical about going due to service, well let me tell you Mitch was on point!  Mitch has just the right amount of enthusiasm, was very attentive, and interacted with us just right.  I'm not a fan of fake servers who over do it, so if you want the perfect experience go see Mitch!  Hook him up on his tip too he deserves every dollar! (Don't forget to throw the sushi guy few bucks too!) The food was fresh and delivered in an extremely timely manner!  Good job on turning the place around!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MITCH, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cool music, awesome service, amazing sushi, SCARY-ASS bathroom."}
{"text":"Until we bought the Groupon, we'd never been there. We live a mile away and are so glad to have discovered this place. Our waiter (Joe?) was super friendly and looked so nice in his pressed shirt and tie. He ran the place so well, we thought he might be the owner! :-)   Our Teppan chef was entertaining, professional, and cooked our calamari, shrimp, steak, and chicken to perfection. The sushi was affordable, fresh, and delicious. Great Vegas roll!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here since we had a Living Social deal expiring.  The service was pretty bad and half of my meal was cold.  They do offer all you can eat sushi for $20, but not even sure if it would be worth it."}
{"text":"Customer service at its best! Joey our server even offered to have his family member go get limes so my aunt could have them with her beer. He also gave my niece a soup spoon from the restaurant because she likes it so much lol. The rolls are fresh, tasty and come out quickly. The pieces are completely reasonable and its in an easy access location. Please come see these people and ask for Joey!"}
{"text":"again, if it sounds too good to be true, (all you can eat sushi) then it's probably too good to be true (AYCE sushi).

so some of you are probably saying, \"....he just ate at another AYCE sushi place and was so disappointed, fool you once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\".  we've been living in chandler for 3.5 yrs and we've never even heard of this place.

lesson learned:  never eat at a sushi place that doesn't come with high recommendations from people you have eaten with and trust their palates.

there's a semi-rational reason that other places charge $8-$13 a roll.  if they charge you that much and the sushi is sucky, then you would be the one making a scene at the cash register.

what's the deal w/japanese food being inherently expensive?  they sell us great cars and really do it to us on the food.  show me a japanese restaurant where you can get out the door for less than $15/head and i'll show you kyoto bowl (see review)

for half the price, you can get twice as much food at an authentic chinese restaurant and have a ton of leftovers.  but i guess you can't get chinese cooks to cook it in front of you while catching shrimp in their hats.

go figure

i was amazed that when we went there on a friday night, the place was standing room only (but we were the only people of asian persuasian)    .  i get the impression that the staff is trying to save money (more tips for the 2 waitresses?) because they seemed to be falling all over each other like keystone cops, wizzing past our tables and avoiding eye contact whenever we needed an extra pair of chopstix, napkins or water refills.

am i being the the overly cautious 1st time parent or what?  the waitress brings out the scalding hot soup and passes it right over the head of our 1 y/o daughter sitting in her high chair and plops it down within arms reach of her.  we quickly move it to the adult who ordered it (brilliant).

we were sitting with my friend's 20 or so family members and requested a separate check to ease the confusion.  she stuttered and stammered and said that she was not allowed to do that and that we would have to be on the same check (i guess we had to sit at a separate table to get a separate tab?)  i could see how 18 on 1 tab and 2 on another would be confusing.

my wife ordered the tempura soba noodle soup and said that it was so salty that her tongue is now preserved for life.  i ordered the chicken katsu which was decent, but the sauce was almost like biscuits and gravy style sauce.

if you're on a budget and just wanna stuff your face with low-grade sushi and walk away full, then this is the place.  if you want quality, great tasting sushi, then you'll have to pay the piper.

you have been forewarned"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First timecwas teppanyaki and second time we did teppanyaki dinner at the tables because the grills were full. Let me just say the service sucks in the restaurant. Some were flat out rude. This place is so small and old that you can see smoke from the grill smoke up the sushi room. It smells gross, they have maybe 3 high chairs and their food takes forever. There are so many waiters walking around I have no idea why we had to wait 30 mins just to order and 75 mins for our dinner to come out. No joke, 75 flippin minutes. No water refills and had to chase them down for the check. I will not be going again. EVER. The steak request for medium rare is a joke,Both the meats were so overcooked we just wanted to get the hell out of there."}
{"text":"1st time dining here food was ok service was terrible. Had 3 servers at different times and constantly was searching the room for someone to assist us. Last time I'll ever eat here,  you should retrain your serving staff they are losing you money."}
{"text":"Very impressed. After checking out some of the negative reviews about this place, I thought my $20 for $40 Groupon was going to be a waste. Not the case.

It was tricky to find at first. Once we did see NJR tucked away in the corner, we admired the Japanese-themed doorway and ambiance. The restaurant itself was bigger than I envisioned with full sushi bar, tables and side section for Tepanyaki. I love that smell! The waitress explained that the Groupon was not good for the all-you-can eat, but our $40 dollars took us a long way. I really enjoyed the baked sushi and everything with eel sauce was fantastic. The rolls were a bit smaller than some other sushi places, but I don't like a huge mouthful of fish. They have all of your garden-variety specialty rolls: Vegas, Dragon, Arizona, Philly, Cali, etc. We even got a little dangerous and picked ones we never heard of. They did not disappoint! I was very happy with the variety and all four of us were stuffed.

One of my friends asked for some extra wasabi and they gave us a ton. Arigatou gozaimasu!

Next time I'm going back for the AYCE and the $5.99 saki bombers!"}
{"text":"It can be a little slow sometimes but that is just cause it's usually really busy, come relax and enjoy the great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Service was awful. The place looks run down. Bought this off groupon and even with the discount would not go again."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a 7pm Teppanyaki seating and arrived (on time) to find out it was overbooked. The host asked us to wait 10 minutes while he cleared a space for us and promised to \"take care of us.\"  After waiting outside for 20 minutes we went inside to remind him that we were still waiting. A space was cleared for us about 5 minutes later and we were seated by someone else. No one came to greet us or take a drink order after several more minutes. We got up and left without a word for another restaurant. Will not return."}
{"text":"I actually felt bad for the server. She was running around everywhere and they were clearly under staffed. I've been to ninja at least 30 times, but this was the second time in the last couple months (used to be a regular before kids). We had a groupon. I think restaurants are under prepared for groupon responses. The food was good and the teppan chef was good, but flagging down a waitress for everything isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Came here after a workout to get my grub on because I had a sushi craving. I used a living social deal to get $30 of food.

Came in solo on a weekend afternoon. Ordered 1 sashimi dish and 3 rolls. That came to a $39.00 bill + I left a $5 tip

There was a handful of people already there, but like other reviews stated... Service was slow. I got one plate at a time at 10 - 15 min intervals. Plus my first dish was brought to the wrong table.

Food and service was avg, the ambiance was a dim setting with little natural light into the building because it's tucked in a corner. The energy level is probably bumped up a bit for the evening service because it was super quite while I was there.

$45 for me for a meh type of meal is not worth my time. It's was ok for me to use a Living Social to try this place out. Based off my experience here, I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi."}
{"text":"Haven't had any issues aside from the wait time. However, I don't want fast food sushi, so waiting isn't really a bad thing. 

My daughter loves the Ninja Turtle roll."}
{"text":"the only reason to come here is for the $19.99 all you can eat deal. It does have the widest selection of sushi on the AYCE menu but most of it is average to below average. The unagi here is downright inedible to the point that it makes you sick the second you taste. Its so bad that my friends and I avoid rolls with it.

There rolls are ok but mostly bland (so is a lot of the nigiri) the wasabi roll and 911 rolls definitely bring some heat but are still edible and they are ok. The albacore nigiri however is melt in your mouth and for $20 i could almost justify consuming about 15 orders of it as a meal (i had 6.5 the other night even with 2 other rolls).

The one issue though is something did upset my stomach and my girlfriends but i have been here 3 other times with no issue.

If your looking for a lot of sushi cheap come here but if you want quality this isn't the place to be. Moto's AYCE on saturday's is less expansive of a menu but the fish quality is light years better."}
{"text":"Danger Will Robinson!!! In the mood for overpriced food where the eel is sliced as thin as rice paper?? In the land of the rising prices Ninja riegns supreme, NOT honoring ones internet specials remains a common theme.  West meets East & lacks a feast that justifies the bill. I know that the price of produce is rising, the cost of ac can get ugly, and it's the slower time of the year for restraunt, but it doesn't excuse poor service from the Owner-Mgr."}
{"text":"Very yummy , great chef  he is awesome if you like spicy he will make you a special sauce that's a awesome hot spicy . The Teppan-Yaki was better then most I will say... The only reason I gave it a 4 was because they need to remove the yucky carpet that is smelly yucky and  grossly and redo the bathrooms  as in update ..the staff her are great and as I said great   Teppan-Yaki... I will be back..."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time years ago. Went the other night with friends and spent the same amount of $ I usually spend at Mido for AYCE on a saki bomb and 1 order of salmon sashimi that wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The food is descent but the owner/ manager/ server is rude and  offensive.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"What a deal! We got 5 rolls for $25. This place is a hole in the wall sushi spot but worth going to. Not to fond of the neon light feel inside but it doesn't bother me either. They typically are steadily bust so the wait time is never too long which is really nice. Sushi rolls are fresh and tasty. Customer service was on point and our waiter was attentive. This is in the rotation of our sushi spots that we visit."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we were here.  I remember this being at least a 4-star place.  But based on this visit, I can't really go over 3-star.

By looks, the ambiance is fine.  \"Looks Japanese\".  But they play contemporary rock.  Doesn't fit.  It was enough that I noticed it, which isn't great.

We couldn't do tepanyaki (my first choice) because they had a \"large party coming\".  Several people showed-up, but there were still several griddle/tables available.  I assume they didn't have enough chefs to staff them, but don't really know.  If the room had been filled it would have been easier to shrug my shoulders and accept they had reserved the space.  But it wasn't, so it was a bit annoying.

So we grabbed a table.  We could have grabbed seats at the sushi bar, but we wanted some hot food too.  We ordered a few sushi rolls, and one stir-fried (I assume) beef and vegetable dish (I think it was called Yakiniki).

The rolls were fine.  Nothing really special.  Better than you get pre-packaged in a grocery, certainly.  But I've had better in other restaurants.  Not as good as I remember last time I was here, but maybe my memory is fooling me.  Given the pricing, it should be better.  Again, they were fine.  But not \"wonderful\".

The beef dish was disappointing.  Not much beef.  LOTS of mushrooms, plus some other veggies.  Sauce was nothing special.  Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.

All in all, an unextraordinary meal.  It was fine.  But not as good as I remember, nor as good as I would expect for a place that charges what Ninja charges.

Glad I had a Groupon.  Helped defray my actual out-of-pocket, so that was nice.

If the service had been better I might be able to give 3.5 stars.  But service was inattentive, and inconsistent.  Sometimes it was cheerful, and other times it was impatient.  From the same server over a matter of 10 minutes.  Very strange.  So three stars it is.  I would not avoid this place, but I won't make a point of eating here again either."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and yummy! Love the staff- all you can eat is a great deal! My kids love this place!!"}
{"text":"Waiting and waiting and waiting for the Sushi. They had 8 people and still waited over 30 minutes. Complained about making 16 spicy scallops where I could hear her say it's the most she's ever made. Really? You obviously haven't been a Sushi maker long. The music played wanted to make me scream. If the Sushi person wasn't talking the guys eat off, maybe I could have got my Sushi without waiting now about 40 minutes. They need to pick up the pace. Unbelievable the slow service here. If you in a hurry in an hour forget it. Cancel your plans."}
{"text":"Average once a year visit here since I've lived in this area the past 7 years. My husband picked up a groupon. I remember now why I seldom come here. In fact, I don't see myself returning. Service was prompt but disconnected. After reading other reviews it's apparent that the groupon is looked down upon here. Since it was just the two of us; I only sushi, he teppanyaki we were seated in regular seating. I understand if the food was actually same quality but it isn't. We've came numerous times beforehand where we both did teppanyaki and seated in that area. I've also visited with friends where we only did sushi. So I've had experiences in every scenario. Sushi okay but not worth their asking price and beneath that of local competitors. My husbands dish was absolutely awful that we took it home for the dogs. He ordered from the teppanyaki menu the steak & shrimp combo. I swear it was reheated leftovers drenched in fatty sauce. Only thing of satisfactory is that of a cold bottle of Kirin."}
{"text":"So our 1st time here.. not too busy for a tues night. About 6 tables going. The waiter was an average Joe but very helpful!  The guy behind sushi glass,  Saku, was phenomenal,  so helpful and knowledgeable! ! We were not hungry enough for AYCE, so we did al a carte. A really good product for a fair price.  We will come back again, I love the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since the place I usually go for sushi is closed on Monday. I was pleasantly surprised. The sushi was perfect! I think I'll make this my new go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Shabby, dirty place. Waited 30 minutes for to-go sushi when I was told it would be 15, when I got it home it was falling apart. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, service was bad.  For the location and price I'll go elsewhere for my sushi."}
{"text":"It's my first time here, I'm visiting from California, and unfortunately my last. Maybe I'm too spoiled but one things for sure, their food is not fresh. Whenever I order a salmon skin hand roll, it comes out WARM. Mine definitely did NOT come out warm. It was chewy and stale as if it was premade and sitting out. And the tempura.... don't even want to start. I give this place one star because their fresh fish was decent. The place was slow, and so was the service! My brother had to stand up to give our order to the sushi chefs. There are so many open tables, but no servers?!?! Disappointment."}
{"text":"Had the chance to visit here with a Livingsocial deal. Food was average, generous portion sizes with a cozy like sportsbar atmosphere. Would come back for the all you can eat sushi for $20, however deal was no good on this offer."}
{"text":"Its not often that one finds it actually painful to write a review, but this is one of those times.

Ninja has been one of my favorite places for years for all-you-can-eat sushi.  OK, so the fish isn't exactly what you'd get at Takashi in Manhattan, but it is always fresh and clean, making the $20 for all-you-can-eat one of the great bargains anywhere and the service was always quick, friendly, and helpful.

Unfortunately that all ended a couple of months ago.  A sushi restaurant can only be as good as it sushi-yas and it seems that Ninja has been having staffing issues.

My wife and I went there as usual a few weeks ago on a Saturday night, and as usual, the place was packed.  What was different was that I didn't recognize any of the sushi chefs.  They only had 2 guys working the sushi bar.

Shortly after being seated, a large group came in for teppenyaki and what do you know? The 2 sushi chefs became 1 as the other guy left to do his Benihana routine.  All you can eat is only significant if you can actually get some food.  There is no way in the world 1 guy can supply a room of 40 or so.  Simply can't be done.

I won't even go into how terrible our waitress was because she was new, avoided all contact with the tables because there was nothing she could do about the massive wait to get anything, and it is my understanding that she is no longer there.

OK. So anyone can have a bad night.  My wife and I went there again last week.  This time it was a Thursday and the room was nearly empty.  A different two sushi-yas behind the bar.  Should be OK, I thought.  I was wrong.

The first plate took over 45 minutes.  The reason is that although they had 2 sushi chefs, only 1 was actually producing anything.  The second, a very large bearded white guy in a black nylon do-rag produced a grand total of 1 roll during my first 45 minutes there.  But he was having a grand old time talking to one of the busboys so I got the impression that he couldn't be bothered with customers.

And in a repeat of our last visit, the service was also pathetic.  I sympathize with servers who are getting screwed by the kitchen, but that is no excuse for completely disappearing.  When our first plate finally did appear, it sat on the sushi bar for 10 minutes until my wife finally got fed up, got up and retrieved it herself.

That said, what we did get was great tasting as always.  If you go, you've got to try the 911 roll.  The fresh wasabi in it will make it hard to live with the powdered green horseradish ever again.

Can Ninja be fixed? Absolutely.  It is a staffing problem, not a food problem.  Coincidentally, there have been numerous Help Wanted postings on their Facebook page recently.

Also please note that this review does not include anything about the teppanyaki.  In all these years, I've never had it there.  For all I know it may be the best thing on the planet."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was excellent! We came on a Monday for our daughter's birthday. They made it extra special for her. Good selection for happy hour."}
{"text":"OMG the best sushi In town. Excellent service and great food. Oscar is the best chef in town. All of their food  is too notch and their sushi is the bomb. We had a party of 8 there on a Friday nite and everyone was so friendly great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? The owner/manager whatever she was, was the rudest woman I've ever encountered. She berated her employees and gave the place an air of stress, tension and  unease. Joey, who was the brunt of most of her meanness was the kindness guy, so funny and nice. The restaurant itself was dirty, smelled funny and had bad service. The food was not that great but the chef did a good job. The waitress was nice but came off as flustered and overwhelmed. We did teppanyaki ate and paid. When we got to the car someone came out and said that we'd been over charged and they'd overhead them say that we'd paid for everyone at the table. I went back in and waited my turn all the while listening to the owner run around yelling at her employees. When they got to us it turned out we'd been charged correctly after all but she yelled at the employees anyway.  The evening ended with me literally yelling at the owner to be nice. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place when we are craving sushi dinner. The $20 all you can eat is a great deal if you are hungry enough!  We always have great rolls, I love the Las Vegas and we just tried the gringos and Alaskan roll and those were awesome. 

The service is nothing spectacular, everyone is always super friendly and we always get what we need!  I will continue to come back here for dinner, maybe one day I will try the tapen-ayki."}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi cuts were OK, too thin for my taste. I liked the avocado roll."}
{"text":"I have often come in with friends, wait staff is friendly. The sushi itself is not the freshest I have ever had but we are in the dessert so I understand! We love coming in for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $20? Yes please. So I finally met up with my friend Chris, who lives close to this place for some all you can eat Sushi on a Saturday afternoon. The place was empty, but then again it was around 2pm ( although it picked up by the time we left) We had a little bit of everything as there all you can eat menu is pretty generous. Be careful as you must eat what you order or you will be charged. ( no worries as we made sure there was not a crumb left). Ladies, be advised that their ladies room is a little scary. I mean its kinda dark in there so just be careful! All in all, not to shabby and I will be back to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Still a little slow for teppanyaki but it was worth the wait....our chef was great....very friendly, good food!"}
{"text":"Food is great at reasonable prices. Willing to work with large parties and friendly service. This is our groups go to for Birthday Celebrations."}
{"text":"We did take out.  Chichen beef and shrimp with veggies was very good.  Salad we threw out which was iceberg lettuce with a dab of some sweet Asian salsa type stuff.  Fried rice was extra cost.  2 people came to 30+ bucks - 15 a plate is too much for takeout."}
{"text":"We came at 5:30, only one other table was sat.  We ordered 6 rolls and waited an hour for the first 5 and another 30 for the 6th.  Why didn't they make all 6, we ordered all 6 at the same time?  The waiter appeared confused about what he was doing the whole time.  We've been coming here with our family for a long time and it seems like something has changed.  Long waits, poor service and clearly friendly is not in their vocabulary - its not worth it.  We'll be trying a new place."}
{"text":"Update 5/13/18...we actually eat here regularly. It's our go-to for all you can eat sushi. Fish is fresh, never ever smells or tastes fishy and although it can be a wait between order and receiving, it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar and my sushi chef was nice as well as all the servers. Patrick has some serious customer service skills.

Mixed reviews for the food: The sashimi was surprisingly soft and yummy. No fishy smells or slime and each slice was cut generously thick. Can't tell how fresh it truly was but wasn't terrible. And then there was my spicy tuna roll which was subpar. There was no flavor to the tuna and they didn't even make their sushi with sushi-rice...it was just plain, white rice! Sushi-rice is standard in every sushi roll everywhere!

The ambiance is quite off with the lighting....and especially since they were playing Martha Stewart baking pastries on the tv while simultaneously blasting Lil Jon's \"Turn Down For What\"....so odd.
I think what threw off the entire experience was that I noticed flea or bug bites on my ankles after getting home from the restaurant. Might not be from there but I can't imagine it coming from anywhere else since I just moved into a new development. And those bites were definitely not on my ankles prior to entering the restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick,courteous service.I ordered the All You Can Eat Sushi.The pieces of raw fish on top were the tiniest that I have ever seen.Except for the sushi you get at the typical buffet."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok. Price for it wasn't that great. I'd rather go Tempura Sushi which is way cheaper! First and last time coming here. Nearly waited an hour for our vegas rolls."}
{"text":"This must have been by far the WORSE experience I ever had in my life. Let's just briefly talk about the food because this is a food review. I ordered a chicken katsu bento box for lunch and it came out to be ~9 dollars tip and tax included. For the amount of food, that was good. The quality of the food was ok - chicken Katy's itself deserves a 3 stars. Miso soup? Ehhh it looked weird. The salad? Poor choice of dressing.

So my coworkers and I came here to have lunch. And for lunch time, this place is not crowded at all. Anyways, we were seated and and were provided ONE menu (for a table of 8 people). We had to ask the waiter for extra menus after a little while. It took the waiter a while to come and get our orders but he finally did. We waited a good 20 minutes and still no food. It's our lunch break so we don't have all the time in the world to be waiting for the food, we have to go back to work you know! So we asked the waiter how much longer and let him know we're in a hurry. Waiter said 2 minutes. Fine. Food started trickling out and he had to go through a curtain from the kitchen while carrying a dish. Curtain touched the dish and a piece of chicken fell on the floor. Luckily that was not my dish. But guess what? He had one order wrong. Guess who's? Mine. So as all of my coworkers food came out I was still waiting on my food. We have been at the restaurant for ~40 minutes already. I asked the waiter for an update and he apologized saying they had to remake my food. Dude. Wth? All my coworkers are already halfway done w their food. Finally when some of my coworkers have already completed their dishes, mine came out. WTF. Are you kidding me? Almost everyone I came with finished their food and then I received mine? 

NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE WILL I GIVE THIS PLACE ANOTHER CHANCE. They were NOT busy so there were no excuses to have taken that long for a meal. Also, they auto tipped (which is fined because we had a party of 8) but they didn't offer to redeem themselves by offering me anything. Dude, I had to watch all my coworkers eat for 30 minutes then my food came out. Your business is freaking ridiculous. I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Meh. I am so disappointed. This USED TO BE my favorite place for sushi, I just didn't live in the area for a while. Now that I live in town and had family in from out of state I took them there for dinner. My reservation (that I verified twice) was wrong when we got there, the service was awful, slow, and although friendly, not worth the tip that was forced upon me due to the larger group.  We did order quite a bit and got a huge amount of sushi, 14 rolls or so I think, we were basically finished (the whole table) and then the sushi guy came out and brought 2 more rolls that no one remembered ordering and even though they showed me the sheet, we still didn't remember it, we didn't eat them but had to pay for them. I know at sushi that the rolls are staggered, but not to the point of letting everyone finish all but a couple of 14-15 rolls and then randomly bring more out and whoops sorry forgot about your sashimi. (at least I was able to cancel that part since we were just DONE and ready to leave) 

Super disappointed and REALLY embarrassed I brought my family here."}
{"text":"I think I've been to Ninja about 10 times. What makes me keep coming back is the freshness of their fish. Why did I give it 4 stars instead of five? Because of a couple of things. The wait staff sometimes appears to forget that you are there. So order all your rolls at once! LOL  The rolls also at times could be tighter. Fall apart at times. They taste great, but I'm not enamored with having to eat my sushi in little pieces. 

OK, so that's the bad stuff. The good stuff? Ninja is a very casual sushi joint that I can go to and take my daughter or a casual date.  The sushi is delicious. Their sashimi is fresh, and their rolls, while not groundbreaking, never fail to satisfy. 

Another nice, added bonus is the Benihana-like back room. If you're into to that salt and pepper swingin', spatula slappin' stuff. :)  Disclaimer! I have no idea if the back room serves any edible food. Haven't eaten there, but it does seem fairly busy.

So try Ninja, I think you'll like it as a change of pace. Especially on Friday and Saturday where the waits are much shorter than at top tier sushi joints."}
{"text":"So apparently yelp doesnt like simple reviews and puts them as tips. So this is a filler. 
Other than that this place is Simply amazing. My number one spot aside from taharu :) get the shake and bake. So good"}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to come here because the name sounded cool. Well. What can you do. I didn't get the AYCE but just some rolls and a giant scone with fish. *shrugs* It was bland and made me sick for 4 days. It was only at a quarter occupancy but it still took them a good 20 minutes to get the food to us. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE TO COOK IT right?"}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughter's 16th Birthday with 8 of her closest friends for teppanyaki! Joey was AWESOME! He helped me get a plan together so I wasn't spending hundreds of dollars! He told me about a Groupon that helped out too! 

I am a single mom that wanted to do something special for my daughter on a big birthday! Thank you to Joey and the staff that made my daughters birthday special and helped me stay with in budget! The food was delicious and our teppan chef had a great personality and was really great with all the teenage girls! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite sushi restaurants. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The all you can eat is a fantastic buy with the rolls being very well prepared and large in size. I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience at Ninja and hope I never do."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Been coming here for 10 years and have a great time every time. Love the tepan chef Oscar! It is always a treat coming into Ninjas and almost always have deals on groupon."}
{"text":"Not a fan.

Went here upon my sister's recommendation but she also said she hadn't been there in about 10 years. So I chanced it because I live really close.

We sit down and the first question our server asks us rather abruptly is, do you have a Groupon? I was like, uh no. Is there a Groupon? So I look on my phone and sure enough there was so I bought one -$19 for $30.

I was not impressed with the food at all. Every roll had cream cheese and krab mix in it or some variation of that. So not a great selection. Wasn't especially fresh and definitely flavorless. And the rice to fish ratio in the rolls was way off. They were like all rice no fish.

On top of that, our food took forever. Sigh.

Not a great value. Without the groupon our bill would have been close to $60 for some mediocre sushi.

So I guess a lot of people come here for their $20 all you can eat special. We decided not to because of all the rules and conditions. No sharing. If you don't eat it all, you pay for what you don't eat...seriously?

One bright spot was the service was pretty good.

Overall, won't be back :/"}
{"text":"For my cultural review I went to Ninja's Japanese Restaurant in chandler Arizona. I've been there many times before and I absolutely love it, it has never let me down. You walk into a Japanese cultured atmosphere. You have a full Sushi bar or the Tepanyaki experience. My favorite is the Tepanyaki! The cooks are wearing tall White Chiefs hats. The food I had was fried rice and teriyaki chicken which was amazingly good. For dessert I got pistachio ice cream; the ice cream looks really weird (GREEN), also sound weird too. At first it didn't sound appetizing then I tried it.  I've never tasted anything like it!  I went with my family and all of them said that they loved their meal too. All in all the food was really good.
 When you eat Tepanyaki, the cooks cook in front of you on a large iron counter. They do a whole show and make it very interesting to watch. They cut onions up and stack them on top of each other and make fire come out like a volcano. They also throw spatulas around and throw food into your mouth. I didn't know that someone could make watching food being made so fun. They make eating out very entertaining. 
 Ninja's is a very fun place to go with family and or friends. Also, it is a great cultural experience. I highly recommend this place for people to go and have a fun time. The price isn't that bad and plus you get a show at the same time. I will continue to come here as much as I can and I think more people need to come and see how interesting this place really is."}
{"text":"Place never disappoints.. always a good anytime.. gotta look for Mimi.. she is the best server and good entertainment. this place is getting busy and the new servers are terrible...sushi is fresh and made to order so make sure you order a lot cause it takes time to make it"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, I shared NY strip dinner. Our Teppanyaki chef was really great. Our server was not, he forgot drink orders, and was not there a whole lot. But everyone has bad days, we will most likely be back soon."}
{"text":"Dined in the dining room vs teppanyaki. Sushi selection was great. So many rolls to choose from! One in our party ordered the terriyaki steak; it was cooked perfectly to order. Beer was cold and sake was hot- everything was great, especially the service!"}
{"text":"Ugh the sushi is terrible here!! There is no flavor and its dry! I have had tons of experience with sushi...the good, the bad, the food poisoning!!"}
{"text":"Our server Patrick was great, he was fast, personable, and very engaging! He was one of the best waiters we have had in a long time by far!!! 

The food was great and it was such a joy to watch the chef prepare it, we loved every second of it!"}
{"text":"Went back and the food is good and the pricing is decent.  Oscar is a great cook and made up for the groupon incident"}
{"text":"It was not good. There were 3 customers and it still took forever to get the food. The ginger tasted metally, the sashimi was cut wrong and felt off, the wasabi had no spice, and the chimichanga roll was a cold fish stick in sushi form. We were reluctant to leave any tip but gave a little something for goodwill."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we wanted to leave, there were 2 girls at a table and no one else in the place it was 3pm, the grill was closed,  We asked for the offer on our groupon and we were told that we had to order off the menue.  We ended up paying 46.00 for nothing but rice horrible mushy tempura with only 2 shrimp and a dried out piece of salmon.  I asked not to over cook it.  My husband ordered the steak and asked for it to be med well and it had blood running out of it.  She offered fried rice but didn't tell us it was extra.  We had water but somhow our bill was over 46.00 with our groupon, Don't go here it is a whole in the wall, felt very dirty and gloomy.  They are very dishonest"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, one Dragon Roll, one California Roll.  Terrible.  Seemed like it had been prepared hours before.  Won;t be going back.  Hoping the freshly prepare stuff is better, but doubt I will even try it."}
{"text":"I LOVE NINJA! I've eaten quite a bit of sushi. Ra is good and so is Kabuki, but that's if your looking for hip contemporary dining with club music playing in the background- which is FINE and all, but sometimes you just want a nice chill spot for a cozy gathering. Ninja is where it's at. A comfortable and chill hole in the wall, this place offers seats at the bar, at your own table, or you can do the Tepinyaki chop chop for a decent price. Great rolls and great service. It's family owned for ALOT of years and we are on a first named basis with most of the staff. Down all this great food with a Kirin sake bomber for the genuine experience."}
{"text":"The wait was long, probably an hour for the first order of rolls. Which has happened before, and i would not have complained if there had been a massive amount of people there, but there wasnt. Table service was lacking. Wouldn't see the server for 20 minutes then would forget what we requested and have to keep coming back. The sushi is great, and they have an all you can eat that comes out to 24 after tax and whatever roll you can't finish you have to pay for. I usually receive better service, I will be returning and I will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I have no idea how the food tastes. We were here for over ninety five minutes and all that arrived were my finance's dinner and his appetizer. My food never arrived and fully thirty minutes after telling us it was given to another table (that complained because I made a modification), I still wasn't given anything. At that point, I cancelled my order. His meal came without soup and salad, so I did request he get those sent, too. Then it was another fifteen minutes for the bill and still fifteen minutes later, we were waiting for our change. At that point, I requested the money back, put down the exact amount including tip, and we left. The server was running around, and it was clear that the problems were in the kitchen. Our meal should have been comped. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Ninja Japanese. Much like the service, I don't know where to start with this place. 
Strolling in just after they opened we were the first group they saw for the day and probably the week.

I really didn't expect much from this place and wasn't really in the mood for Japanese. That being said I had a particular sushi roll that was pretty good, and another that was kind of bland.

The soup and salad to start was an added bonus but, neither satisfied my curiosity. The soup tasted like an ashtray as did the green tea later in the meal.

some decent and good choices do exist but all at a level far below what I'm used to back home; for this reason alone I cannot give this place a positive rating... 

The entire time we were there, the \"hostess\" was talking extremely loud on the phone, never seeming to take a breath or let the person on the other end speak. This, along with the super dark atmosphere sealed the deal and made it very difficult to even try to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"My last night in Phoenix, before going to Las Vegas to see my youngest son. My sister originally wanted to go to Naples Ristorante ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/naples-ristorante-chandler#hrid:aBzZ0Y_OGjtgh9P2AAEMpQ ), her favorite Italian restaurant. But, she noticed Ninja Japanese Restaurant on the way to Naples. Looks like Japanese tonite!

Miso Soup (***) Small oriental-style bowl of over-Salted Miso Soup. Just too much Soy Sauce!

Dinner Salad (***) Iceberg Lettuce with a unique Ginger-based Salad Dressing that was reminiscent of Thousand Islands.

Benihana tonight...
Teriyaki Steak (****) Not up to the quality of the Seafood, but tender nevertheless. Asked for medium-rare... got medium.

Shrimp &amp; Scallops (*****) The tenderest Scallops I've had in Phoenix! And the de-shelled Shrimp wasn't half bad either!

Side of Vegetables (*****) Also grilled by the Benihana Cook... noticed the cook uses Butter in almost before grilling anything. Very, very good.

Fried Rice (*****) Also a part of the Benihana experience.

The Hispanic Benihana Cook had worked at Ninja for over five years; he said he started off as a Food Prep person and gradually acquired skills in Benihana Cooking and eventually became a Sushi Chef also. The Cook says it will take three months to acquire the knife-handling skills demonstrated at the beginning of the meal.... knife blades flashing all over, tap-tap-tapping of knives against the grill... pretty impressive, as I'm not a knifing expert!

Lemonade (****) Never saw the bottom of the glass... cold and refreshing!

Sake (****) My sister didn't want to try straigh Sake. I convinced our waitress to mix a Sake-White Wine Cooler! Worked out pretty well... not as strong as pure Sake, chilled rather than heated.... you can appreciate both types of liquor... chilled!

Service (*****) Very friendly and outgoing waitress... who happened to be the sister of the owner. She was very accommodating to the least flexible and least experimental of the family... my sister. Ninja Japanese Restaurant has been at this location for close to thirty years... starting off as a straight Japanese dinner restaurant... adding Benihana Grills and Fans as that type of Japanese cooking became in vogue... then converting some space and adding Cooks for the Sushi craze in the last decade.

Total tab: $53.

The decor of the restaurant reflects the changing face of Japanese cooking the last three decades. In the main dining area... 70s style hanging round globe lamps... A more modern Sushi style bar area at the rear of the restaurant where it looks a lot more \"fun\" talking to the Sushi Chef and all that... To the right as you enter, a strictly dated and dark Benihana-style dining area with Grills that could accommodate up to thirteen people and as few as six. Why is it dark? When your Benihana Cook arrives with all the food... he / she gets highlighted by the built-in lamps embedded in the vents above him. Techno Japanese rap was played pretty loud throughout our meal! I guess this is an attempt by Ninja to attract a younger restaurant audience. Don't think the music is going to work, though!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's be completely honest. Chandler does not have the greatest sushi restaurant selection.  We've tried several non-chain restaurants in the area with a sense of defeat and remorse being the shared feeling of the group at recounting our ordeal. 

However, when visiting Ninja Japanese, we were pleasantly surprised.  Truth be told - if compared with the best of the best sushi and teppanyaki places on the planet Earth, it would fall mid to bottom of the scale (authenticity and fresh out of the water tasty goodness with the perfect pairings and accompaniments is truly hard to find).  BUT if you are in the east valley, this is definitely worth a visit!  We were big fans of the following:

* FANTASTIC SERVICE.  Our waiter (I WISH I could remember his name for a proper shout-out) was amazing - attentive, professional, prompt and knowledgeable of the menu's choices.  What else could you ask for?
* YUMMY SUSHI ROLLS, SASHIMI & SAKE.  Everything we ordered tasted fresh and delicious.  Again, I wish I could remember exactly what we ordered (too much sake maybe).  We did take the waiters suggestions on a few selections and they didn't disappoint.  A non-sushi believer in our group even ordered a chicken teriyaki plate that they seemed to enjoy very much as well. 
* UPBEAT/MODERN ATMOSPHERE.  There was fun music playing in the background, clean and contemporary decor and although you could definitely wear a nice top and jeans, I felt completely comfortable in my dress and heels.  

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bland.

Had to eat every bit of blandness or else I would be charged extra for any blandness I left on the plate.

As a \"thank you for eating here,\" the waitress gave our group a surprise plate of sushi, something newly concocted by the chef. We were heartened, thinking it might be some sort of dessert sushi to sweeten the palate, but no. More bland sushi, artfully decorated with KETCHUP. Bleahhhh!!!

I guess they thought the Americans would like it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years and every time I go is better than the last. We had the BEST waiter EVER! Thank you Jason! He even made a Rotten Coconut Martini on the fly which was the best way to chase the sake bombers. The sushi is always on point. Perfect date night"}
{"text":"If I could give a 3.5, I would. 

Was kinda apprehensive about this place after reading the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The biggest negative would be the bathrooms. It was like I was in some nasty truck stop in Detroit or something... Just gross. The girls was also confirmed to be in the same sorry state  Have some respect for your business and your customers. Invest a bit of your money in the bathrooms, it will make a difference. 

And now, the food: it was surprisingly good! I don't know why some teppanyaki places give you crappy broth for soup but this place gives you actual miso. It was like suckin on a cube of MSG. delish. The filet and scallops were some of the best. it looked like he had overcooked the scallops but, aside from them not being the largest I have eaten, they were some of the most tender and delicious. Same with the filet - melt in your mouth goodness. 

Oh, one other thing ... Chill out with the garlic!!! I love garlic but putting a couple tablespoons worth on each item is waaaaay too much. Next time I will ask they use half the amount and it would still be pretty garlic-y.

oh, and they broccoli as one of the veggies. and why cant i get my fried rice in a bowl? its so much easier to eat."}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for. The prices are decent and the portions are good. They have a good variety of sushi choices and Japanese food choices. I was happy to find this gold mine. Will defanitly come here again with family and friends."}
{"text":"Sadly, I don't think I will be coming to this place anymore. I loved the concept of the all you can eat option, and the sushi itself is pretty good, but the terrible service and iffy sanitary status really kills it. I've been here a few times, and it was fine, but the last trip was not a great experience. I do want to say that the busser was very friendly and helpful, so shoutout to him. However, our waiter was pushy (we felt pressured to put in our order before we were ready) and rude. Everything was extremely slow, from getting our drinks, to actually getting our order right, to receiving our rolls. There was a steady stream of customers, but nothing to warrant the 2 hours and 15 minutes we spent in there.

And just to top it off, one of our water glasses had a suspicious slimy gunk on it, the bathrooms are gross, and someone in our party noticed the waiter putting his hand in someone's wine to fish something out of it, rather than pouring a new glass.

I think it's time to find a new sushi place!"}
{"text":"I don't know if they had a change in management or a huge staff turnover but the service has tanked recently. 

My husband and I stopped in last weekend because we were both having a craving for sushi. When we walked in there was one couple at the bar and 2 other tables- pretty quiet for a Saturday afternoon. We figured we would get service fairly quickly. Wrong. In total we had 2 miso soups, 5 rolls (AYCE) and 8 pieces of sashimi. From the time we ordered the first roll to the time we paid the check it took AN HOUR AND A HALF. The sushi chef was newer and I get that staff needs to train but it took freaking forever. On top of that our server was damn near impossible to track down to get water refills. It was just bad all around. The sushi itself was OK but the sashimi was cut really unevenly. 

What a shame that this place has started to go downhill. This used to be my go-to sushi place but after the last few visits I don't think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Meh.  Came here for a sushi lunch, and it wasn't bad. But that's really about all I can say. Let's be honest, folks:  pretty much any sushi joint in the Valley is going to offer the same things, nigiri-wise. You've got your tuna, salmon, bay scallops (the little eraserhead ones), orange/red clam, octopus, squid, and eel. There's really nothing more adventurous than any of that. Then you have your makki-menu, in which they have the traditional offerings and then a huge page of locally-named rolls with one or two ingredients switched up for fun.

Had an order of hamachi sashimi, nigiri shiromaguro, escolar, and saba. The pieces were good, and certainly on par with sushi that I've had elsewhere in the area. We ordered two hand rolls, and the salmon-skill hand roll was a little too much on the crunchy side. Ordered two other rolls and they were quite good. But honestly, there wasn't anything that rocked my socks- this is pretty much just your typical Japanese joint with tried-and-true stuff that white people can feel adventurous about eating.

... which is why I'll never be back. If you're the type of person who likes to tell your friends about how much you LOVE sushi, but only order from the all-you-can-eat or dollar-sushi menu, then you'd love this place. It's your type of place. But if you're someone who is fiending for that ethereal uni, or some ikura which just pops in your mouth, or ama-ebi with the tempura-fried head, then you're going to be disappointed- just like I was. Ah well, the search continues..."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice, and been pretty pleased each time. I love the Boston and Philly Roll, and my husband really likes the 911 roll. The edemame is pretty good, but I wish they had chunky salt instead of table salt, and it could stand to be a little crunchier/fresh. When they bring it out, it's literally piping hot...right out of the *cough* microwave. No, I'm not surprised that it's most likely microwaved, I'm sure a lot of us would be surprised how many restaurants microwave dishes (however, I'm not defending them. They shouldn't be!)

The first time I came here, I got the Las Vegas Roll, because whatever Sushi place I happen to visit, I've always been impressed with the different variations of it. This visit wasn't so pleasant. I had my husband try a piece too, and he agreed, that something was...off. I'm pretty sure they used burnt oil or burnt grease. Something. It was some chemical gone wrong taste. SO needless to say, I won't order the Vegas Roll again. It *may* have been a mistake, but I'm a little scared to try it again just to see.

We usually go on a weekday between 3-4 so it's dead (I mean DEAD, we're the only ones there) so service is prompt. I can't speak for everyone else on the hour waits.

Overall, for the price (happy hour sushi is $3-4) we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Sushi was decent.  Felt like the only thing that was fresh was salmon. Waitress was good.  Sushi chef (Andy) I believe his name was gave horrible service. He was only paying attention to the two girls that were in front of him. The were only 2 tables including us and it took him 15 mins to make 4 pieces of nigiri. Then our order of salmon nigiri was doubled cause he didn't tell the other chef what he made. Other than that place was nice. Nice warm feeling."}
{"text":"I can say I will NEVER Eat here again! We ordered the All you can eat & sadly we did not like some of the sushi we ordered so we told the girl to take the plates and she came back and told us to eat it or they were going to charge us for 2 rolls! And the last time I ate at a all you can eat they don't tell you to eat something you don't want!  & when we got up to pay the bill it came up to $75.00 for 2 people!  Never Again......."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and always enjoy myself. Fish is fresh and the seaweed salad always delicious. Also a fan of their Iced Green tea.

Lately, the sushi chef -- which is very nice -- doesn't speak very much English. But, that's OK. 

 Be sure to check out the lunch special as well as the all a cart happy our selections."}
{"text":"Not high-end sushi, but for $25 the quality & variety of the all-u-can-eat (ordered fresh from a menu) is very good. We always have friendly & prompt service as well."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat sushi. It was our fault for going there so late, but they were still kind and didn't seem like they were rushing us. The sushi was what you'd expect from a sushi place in Arizona. The wait time was a little long, but that's to be expected when there are other people there eating all you can eat sushi as well as us ordering a lot at one time. 

For $20 per person and unlimited sushi, I'd go back and I'd tell others to go."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few of the teppenyaki places in the east Valley.  Came here tonight with a Groupon and it was so good!  Our chef was personable and did a great job.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"it's almost a ritual with my old roommates and I, we get together and have all you can eat sushi at Ninja, love this place, it's just a good place to eat, been on a few dates there as well, great atmosphere, decent price for a large group."}
{"text":"Some people organize a private party once a year here as part of a convention. It's not cheap, but the all you can eat sushi has been pretty much the highlight of that weekend each year. It is freaking tasty. (I've had a decent amount of sushi; this place is some of my favorite.) I'm not local, though, so I've never been here except for that event; so I can't really comment on the service (it's always great when they're hosting a hundred person lunch party ;))."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service - it took 1.5 hr (first grill) and 2 hours (second grill) before they started cooking for my daughters 36th birthday.  

Reservations at 6p on Sun for 18 people (2 full grills). Didn't get drinks until 630, order at 645. 

First grill started 730, second grill started at 8. First grill table was eating before second grill even started. 

You can see in the photo taken at 8p - our grill is just getting oil. Second grill is serving entrees (in background). Several in group had to leave and meals cancelled. 

Chefs were \"great\" but it ended up taking nearly 3 hrs for dinner.  Maybe it's mgmt issue, scheduling or whatever, don't necessarily know if it was chefs fault or mgmt failure."}
{"text":"Not bad. Went there for all u can eat sushi. Price was just under $22.00. Food was good, service was mediocre, and location has hard to see the signage. Overall it's a decent place. I would go back again for the value mainly and if I was super hungry."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Definitely more bang for your buck. I'd come here before going to Benihana's again due to the pricing & the flavor! The waitstaff was not the best."}
{"text":"I had never had sushi until I tried this place. The Arizona Sushi is to die for! I've tried almost all of their sushi, but keep going back for the AZ sushi:) Good environment."}
{"text":"This one star is for the waitress, but other than that, we waited for almost 1 hour, no food no nothing, the soup was extremely salty. People who came after us already got their food. **DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT**."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat when you have a hefty appetite! We always get the all-you-can-eat sushi. It's about $20 but it is SOOOOO worth it! The catch is you will be charged with anything left behind (including rice). So be careful! We've left in fullness pain a couple times, mostly due to the fact that my sister likes to order 10 or more orders of sashimi! They get you with the large amount of rice they put under the raw fish, so I, personally, like to go for their specialty rolls. I recommend the volcano rolls, but don't eat them right away because they are scolding hot but super delicious! I also like the Kentucky roll a lot, it is a roll that is filled with Japanese style fried chicken and wow its amazing. Almost anything they have on the menu is worth a try!! Again, it's all you can eat so be sure to look through ALL of their specialty rolls and try as many as you can finish! Also, make sure you ask for some unagi sauce on the side, that stuff is good on everything!! The staff is really nice and super attentive and when there is a birthday, the gong comes out!"}
{"text":"UPDATE May 11th, 2017 - I was asked to comeback & give it another try after our first worst experience at Ninja. Service has gotten better & we didn't wait that long for our food. Now I would rate it a 3.5-4 stars.


May 9th, 2017 ---So disappointing waited over an hour just for our food. I will not comeback not even for macaron ice cream sandwiches.. no thanks.. Very slow services.."}
{"text":"I gave this places two chances because friends of mine like the sushi there. I was warned about the service but decided to try it, anyway.
The food is mediocre.
The service is terrible.  Both times, the servers forgot to give us menus, forgot to bring drinks, and the last time we were there (last night), we did the all you can eat for $20 special and only half of our sushi was brought out.  The waitress blamed it on the chefs.  She kept making all sorts of mistakes bringing us the wrong order, other people's sushi orders, the wrong beer, or a sake bomber without the sake, and then to top it off, when I went to pay the bill, she walked away forgetting to take my credit card. Leaving $0 in tip is just plain mean so I did leave something.. but that's the last time I will ever come to this place ever. I don't recommend it at all.  Bad customer service, waiting 45 min for half of the sushi order to arrive, and mediocre food.  Also, the techno music was so loud and really killed the ambiance."}
{"text":"Called in to make a reservation for 8:00. We showed up 10 minutes early and they hadn't put us on the list. Miles was the one who took the reservation. Then they tell us that they didn't put us (my hubby, 2 kids and myself) on the list. They tell us that we can wait 10 minutes for a table then they will start cooking in a half an hour. I wasn't happy with this since we have two elementary age children but what could we do? We chose to stay as the kids were looking forward to it. We waited 10 minutes and the assistant manager comes back and says \"yeah so it's going to be a ridiculous length of time. At least an hour or so\" no real apology. Not willing to do anything to make up for their error. I had a Groupon and was told I could call to take care of getting my money back. I ask to speak to a manager. Assistant manager comes back out and says he's too busy to speak with us and it will be 10-15 minutes so I say we'll wait and he again goes back and comes back and says \"it's going to be a really long time\" and explains that he's the assistant manager and asks how he can help... we ended up leaving with disappointed kids, no solution and needing to figure out where to spend our money. Well 5 miles away, Hon machi is the way to go and we spent our $200 there. At least we spent our time at a place with good service, great food, and a great show. Considering going some place that they actually appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it. Ever since Hana Japanese Eatery opened up near me I have become a sushi snob.
But, we had been to Ninja a couple times before and it wasn't bad. They are reasonably priced and have specials. The staff is nice and friendly, decent atmosphere, fairly intimate and dark, a little loud sometimes, but ok.
So we were ok with it when our friends invited us out to Ninja for dinner.
They say the third time is the charm.  Well, this time it wasn't.
The sushi was bland with a lot of rice. Too much rice. It was just about all you could taste. Mussel, calamari, tuna, etc., it almost all tasted the same. I had a hard time getting my mouth around some of the pieces. The rolls, too, we are rice, with about a third of the center being the ingredients. 
Before Ninja was not bad. But this time it was."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I loved the food and service which is why I came back, this time I came there was 3 tables and it took 30 minutes to get half our order of nigiri (literally only 14 pieces of salmon). This is very slow as the other tables were already served. It seems the people preparing sushi were very inexperienced or just working too slow to make us full or lose our appetite."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to do this but this place has just gone downhill. We went there for my birthday supper on 5/7 and we originally had a party of five. It was about 5 pm so definitely not busy yet. We ordered our drinks and then waited to see what we wanted from the all you can eat sushi√ó3 we put in our first rolls it took about 10-15min for them like we thought they would. After that our party grew to 10. That's when all hell broke loose. Apparently the waiters didn't know who was waiting on our table anymore and we had to flag down like three people to see what was going on. They forgot orders and they never refilled our cups. The second and third orders of sushi were gross the octopus when you bit into it felt like a squirt of cold water came out. We have been coming here for years and the sweet Asian lady who owns (owned?) It always does a great job. Today there was a lot of American people who seemed to have NO clue how to run this place. We were there for almost 3 hours and it was embarrassing when your party has never been here and your raved about how amazing the food was here. The pregnant lady there amber I think is her name seriously so rude! That will most likely be my last trip there. This place is definitely turning into a hipster place yuk."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for decent priced all you can eat sushi. There was impromptu karaoke on the last Friday night I was there...made my experience even more fun!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Loved the atmosphere...wish I was a regular here. Seems like that type of spot. If I lived closer this would definitely be one of my go to spots. Food was delish, services was great and friendly. Getting our rolls kinda took some time but that's ok since everything else was good. #Yum"}
{"text":"Great sushi, but worst customer service I've ever experienced. I went back last February and had a terrible server, and was at the restaurant for approx. 2 and a half hours. I then went back last week thinking maybe I just went on a bad day, but the service was even worse! Our server was great, but I tru they felt bad for him. The restaurant was completely full, and there was one server and one sushi chef. The wait time for food was extremely long, and I was sick of it, so I paid before all of my food came out (we did all you can eat sushi so everything came out at different times), and so I left  because frankly I was sick of waiting there for over 2 hours."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good sushi restaurant pass this one by. First of all it is absolutely filthy. The service was marginal at best. The Boston roll that we ordered was inedible (tasted like the fish had gone bad). The California roll, jalape√±o poppers and miso soup were decent. It was just hard to really enjoy anything in a restaurant that is so disgusting. Even though it was happy hour our bill was still $50 for two people. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots. I've been going to Ninja for a few years. If you're looking for a fun dinner with friends and everyone loves sushi, this is the place to be. The staff is usually pretty friendly, the music is always fun and when everyone gets all you can eat, you can experiment with the different kinds of rolls together. I typically go with my friends on my birthday and we always have a great time. As far as the quality of the sushi, I'll give it a 3.5 out of 5 but I always come back for the laid back experience. They also have teppanyaki which I tried for the first time last month. That I will give 5 out of 5. Holy smokes it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a die hard fan of Sushi, I was talking to some people I don't know , and they said they loved this place.  Well I went in, and I have to learn the hard way.

The attitude was snobish. the sushi was below the proper temperature, and they microwaved my surf clam! really? the scallops were nearly unedible. and the quality over all stunk, 

I always appreciate good service, but this was not that.

I wish I had a dollar for every time I drove by the past 3 years. that way I could get my money back. I will stick with excellent quality sushi in the area, either sushi eye, or Sakana in Awatukkee.


why explain more. I am being generous with 2 stars. I wish I liked the place. Lets face it . You get what you pay for!. 

the extra star, is for actually having albacore tuna that isn't seared, but I can get that at Sakana.

some people that think deep fried rolls are \"sushi\" will probably like this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good quality sushi. Ayce $21.99 for dinner. And happy hour prices on Sunday."}
{"text":"The food was literally not fit for consumption, the chicken I was given was grey, and didnt even have the decency to cover my chicken katsu with the sauce It was desperately missing. Fifteen dollars for a plate of awful fried chicken sitting on top of some measly pieces of lettuce with no rice? If you like over priced food that might kill you if you eat it, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Love the all you can eat sushi. Most places will limit the type of sushi you can order. Not Ninja. The only issue is when it gets busy they are pretty understaffed. But sushi is excellent."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the ambience warns you to leave immediately. But despite that we stayed because we bought a Groupon and wanted to try it out. The food was gross. They brought out a soup that was very salty with a burnt taste I don't know what it was supposed to be obviously the chef never tries the soup it was disgusting. The salad came out with what looks like dark applesauce plopped on the top of it. My five-year-old thought it was baby throw up. The actual cook at the table was pretty good I really enjoyed it but the food wasn't worth it total for four people, Groupon said it was $60 worth of food for four more people but our total was $95 with no alcohol. 

Service was good that waitress was very nice and prompts. I just think this place is way overpriced for the quality of its food and the Decour. The chair that I want to sit on had food from the previous table on it and the grill was caked with Greece it was spilling in between the countertop and the grill itself.

Lastly, they charge three dollars extra for each meal if you want fried rice. They even charge the three dollar fee for a child's menu to get fried rice. Outrageous!"}
{"text":"Does this business owner even read the reviews here?

TL;DR: Slow and inaccurate service, server is vague on Groupon, tells us we must buy two orders when it was never specified on the Groupon itself. I give the food a grade 'C' at best.

I originally came to this plaza with my dad to eat Chon Thai, one of my favorite Thai places here in the Gilbert-Chandler-Mesa triangle.  Turns out they only do delivery at 2:45pm (they close at 3) so since we wanted some place to sit down and this one had a Groupon for the Teppanyaki, we figured might as well give it a shot. (During this time there was a Groupon for $16 for $30 on Teppanyaki)

I read the previous reviews here and understood the risks but we went in anyways.  The first thing to note is the atmosphere. Yes, there are other reviews on the atmosphere but I must drive this point home.  Pink neon lights, 80's music, and soap operas playing on three of the four TVs made it feel odd to sit down in what was essentially an empty restaurant (There was one other party there.)  We initially got seated in the sushi (or Japanese Cuisine as they call it) area and after some minor confusion we moved over to the teppanyaki tables.  During this time, the server lady took her time in between coming to help us.  About 30 minutes later we finally got to order, only for her to tell us that we MUST use the Groupon to buy TWO teppanyaki orders.  Nowhere on the Groupon's fine print does it say we needed to buy two orders, just that we were going in for a \"meal for two\".  That's fine, instead of sharing the filet mignon, we get two chickens and cancel the sushi order.  Cue more waiting, until our chef comes out about 10 minutes later.  

After the light show and singed eyebrows that was our teppanyaki show, we finally got to chow down on the food. It wasn't poor but it wasn't great either. Either way, let's look at the food we received:

Chicken Teppanyaki: The chicken breast was on the dry side but the vegetables were good, albeit some of the salts were unevenly spread leading to some of the vegetables being lighter in taste. The sauce for the meat was light and only really tasted of wasabi while the vegetable sauce was salty.  

Salad: Who puts this much dressing on the salad anyways? I ate the leaves and left the rest of the dressing off to the side. There was about 2-3 tablespoons there, like seriously? The bowl was maybe 1.5x the size of a rice bowl.  Other than that the dressing is the standard you get in most Japanese sushi bars. I unfortunately don't know what it is called but if you visit sushi bars regularly you will recognize it.

Steamed Rice: I see other reviewers complaining about the rice being day old.  No complaints about the food here, but our server forgot to bring it out to us until we asked for it.  

Miso Soup: Other reviewers say it is salty, I had no issues.  This was probably one of the better, more balanced parts of the meal.  

Water: Other reviewers mention there was some slime in their water. I did not see anything here. We ordered the standard ice water with lemon.  

All in all, steer clear from this place.  Your money is better spent elsewhere, the a la carte sushi rolls and sashimi was over double the standard at other popular places in the area."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. We got a groupon and decided to give it a go. Why more people aren't enjoying the flavors and entertainments are beyond my comprehension. This place was sadly empty. We were the only ones at one of many teppanyaki tables. Wake up people! You get delicious dinner and a show! The chef was super friendly and cooked our seafood perfectly. I couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Went on date night with hubby. Had the sashimi which was $17.95 and came with miso soup and a salad. Service was great and food was delicious!! If you're hungry they offer all you can eat for $21.95. We'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Empty! Very rude and slow service.for the price you can go to.benihana where they show appreciation for your business and the place isn't falling apart. Oscar did a good job with making the teppanyaki but our server was awful! Plain rude. Would not go back ( even with a Groupon,save your money)"}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with other Japanese restaurants in Chandler, but this one was a great find. You'll get the authentic Japanese feeling when you walk in and you're greeted in Japanese by a hosted who will seat you(of course you can sit at the bar or at a table). The decor and ambiance of the restaurant sets off the mood just right for a casual date night.

The service was excellent and the food came out fairly fast for how busy they were. Couldn't remember what we had ordered but it was good. Would dine again in the near future."}
{"text":"I went to Ninja Sushi today.  My wife and I wanted sushi.  After our experience today, I do not think we will return.  Here is why.

1) The sushi quality is good
2) The management is average
3) Sometimes the quantity is kind of chinzy

My wife was comparing it to other sushi restaurants in the East Valley, and it is more money then elsewhere.  As far as value (quality + quantity + cost), it is not as great a value compared to other sushi restaurants.  My wife on the drive back was complaining that the quantity for the cost of the food is significantly less.  She told me that for the equivalent cost we spent on dinner tonight, we can get sushi elsewhere in the East Valley, with same or better quality, and significantly more quantity.  

Please get your restaurant better organized.  You lost our sushi card.  

Please be more accurate on the sushi counts, as many times the counts listed on the menu regarding the number of pieces is significantly different."}
{"text":"Older establishment but good service and food. The miso was way too salty but the teppan chicken, steak and veggies were really good. Our teppan chef was really friendly. Visited due to a Groupon and would go back for sure even without one as it was competitively priced."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon to come here for the first time. The food was good. The shrimp were a good size. Our cook was disappointing though. He was not very entertaining."}
{"text":"Nick our sever was great with the grand kids. The food was good! The eel was awesome!! So fulll"}
{"text":"You're the salmon to my sticky rice.

\"You\" as in the reader... not Ninja Japanese Restaurant.  Not gonna sugar-coat it, at first glance, this place looks seedy.  It's cluttered with neon lights, chinzy paper lanterns, and your typical Japanese decor like fans and umbrellas.  The ceiling is painted pink so everything that's served looks as suspect as the establishment itself.  Service is lacking and they badly need more servers and bussers.  I saw one waitress clear out a lone patron's spot at the sushi bar when he went to the bathroom but was still eating.  How rude.

What can I say about the food?  The fish for sashimi and nigiri are sliced uneven and thin and the salmon skin hand roll looks like taco meat yet smells fishy.  I did like the Hipster Roll and the Shake-and-Bake seemed interesting until the over-powering garlic got to be too much.  I also found the color on the salmon nigiri to be startling.  Remember how I mentioned the pink ceilings casting a weird pink light to everything?  If it wasn't for the lights, I could almost swear that the salmon had no color to it.  The wait time for food is ridiculously long and the rolls are a bit small.

What more can I say?  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for my teammates and I after a heavy training session. We always do all-you-can-eat sushi. For me, it's the best I've had. Other places seem to do just a variety of california rolls. This has sashimi and other great, and wonderous things. We live for the volcano roll! I love the employees. They are really cool. They know us there so they know they're in for the long haul. We're there for hours and on occasion, when the rolls have been too slow to come out, we have gotten a couple of complimentary food items. Next time I am in town, I am going to hit this place up."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best.  Server has stank attitude and took nearly twenty minutes just to get our drink order.   They weren't even that busy, maybe 4 tables total. Took nearly 45 minutes to get our sushi and there were three guys behind the counter.  I used to enjoy this place years back when I would go.  There was a great manager/server named Jared who always kicked ass.  Only reason they got two stars is the food was okay but that wait was horrid!!!
Also the place was filled with smoke so you know their hood for their teppin side haven't been cleaned in ages if the whole place is that hazy! (Only two tables were seated in there with two couples)."}
{"text":"I typically eat sushi weekly, and fortunately for me, was made aware of Ninja this past month.  I think I have been there nearly 10 times this past month or two alone.

Ninja offers great food at an unbeatable price.  The Boston roll is my favorite roll that I have had anywhere--only $4 on happy hour too!  The Spicy Tuna is better than at Kona or Ra, too, and for a lower price ($3 happy hour, for instance).  $20 all you can eat with great selection--try the Albcarore.

Asahi bombers for $5-$6--they also have delicious plum sake.  I wish I had known about Ninja a few months ago to celebrate my birthday rather than Ra.  Ninja would have saved my group $100-$200 and offer a better overall experience, namely in quality of food."}
{"text":"Came here for all you can eat sushi for $20. I never even knew this place existed, but I was happy when my friends mentioned it. We visited on a weekend and it wasn't too over crowded. I don't love Japanese beer (too damn light for me), but the sushi we had was good. All fresh made so it takes a little while but it's worth it. The moshi soup was yummy, too."}
{"text":"Food is very good, but the night we were there they ran out of tables and the service was slow. The all you can eat option looks good if you generally order more than 2 rolls. Might try again."}
