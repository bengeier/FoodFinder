{"text":"It's just really nice to have a quick, high quality alternative for an excellent cup of coffee at a reasonable cost. My cafe latte included a chocolate covered coffee bean nestled in the lid; I noticed it as I drove away. Friendly conversation and a hot and tasty coffee to continue through my day in this freezing weather. I have really started to focus on supporting our small businesses; after checking out their web site, I knew I had to stop by and support Bean Thru. Super great addition to the Route 8 corridor commute!

{"text":"This is my favorite drive through coffee/tea place! Although I am not a coffee drinker, I LOVE their vanilla chai latte! It is the best I've had, even better than Starbucks. The employees are always very kind & friendly. I also love that I am supporting a locally owned small business. They also have delicious muffins!"}
{"text":"This is very convenient and the staff there are very friendly.  I drive thru pretty regularly, however, my only compliant is that sometimes my coffee isn't hot enough.  I know they have not been open long, so I'm hoping they will work this out because I enjoy everything else about this place."}
{"text":"I love it here! Such a cute little drive-thru coffee joint. They have so many options, whether you want a flavored latte (the butter pecan is SO yummy), or just a plain ol' cup of joe! One of my favorite things about this place though, are their sausage and egg breakfast burritos. You get 2 in your order and they may seem small but they are the perfect portion. You can add hot sauce if you'd like which is my preference. There is just something about these little burritos that is so great. Their prices are pretty reasonable as well. It also helps in the mornings that they have 2 separate lines you can drive thru to get your order. The people are always friendly too! Oh, and the fact that you always get a little chocolate covered espresso bean with your coffee is a plus as well."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with the basics. Coffee. The coffee is excellent. Just fantastic. I've never had a beverage here that I didn't enjoy, and I've had a fair amount of beverages here.

Every drink you get comes with a chocolate covered espresso bean on the lid, which is delightful in a way that I cannot accurately express. The service is always friendly and patient, even when I'm waffling over if I should get a muffin or not. The answer to that question should always be YES.

I don't know what's going on in this little magical hut, but they are producing the best damn muffins I've ever had. Maybe they've made a pact with The Baba Yaga to imbue each muffin with joy. Maybe they're teleporting them in from a better, more delicious timeline in which muffin technology has advanced several generations. I don't know, and I don't care. I just want more.

Also, their prices are great, the service is fast and they're conveniently located. But seriously. MUFFINS."}
{"text":"I go here about twice during the weekdays and maybe once during the weekend. The employees are usually friendly and quick. Their speciality drinks are yummy (lattes and Americanos), but the regular coffee is just ok. Their cappuccino is usually mostly airy milk not even filled 3/4 the way to the top of the cup. Don't waste your $ on this drink. However, all their drinks come with a chocolate or vanilla covered expresso bean on top of the cup which is a nice touch (\"bean thru...\"). Their muffins and baked treats are awesome. Their breakfast sandwiches 5 out of 10. The prices on their drinks are about the same as other fancy coffee places. I recommend this place as solid quick place to get quality coffee on the go."}
{"text":"I wish BeanThru was on my way to work but I know my husband is silently celebrating that it is not. 

I love this place! The employees are so friendly and the drinks are delicious! Every chance I get, I make it a point to stop here for an iced latte. Mmmm"}
{"text":"This little island on the side of Rt. 8 has pretty much what you need for breakfast and brunch. 
Super fast service, just pull up on either side of the store and roll down your window. 
Fresh coffee; regular and dark, ready with creamers, sugar, sweetners and stevia. They even put a chocolate covered espresso bean on each coffee lid. How sweet is that? 
Delicious home-made bars that are out of this world! Breakfast sandwiches, cold made-to-order drinks, the list goes on and on. 
 
I live near by and I've seen this coffee shop switch owners but Bean Through finally got it. 
One thing I think would help get more customers is a coffee shaped neon sign so the drivers can see them before they drive past it. Rt. 8 is not a road to stop all of a sudden."}
{"text":"I wavered between a 4 and a 5 for Bean Thur, but decided to bump to the five because their coffee is excellent.

In Alaska, our largest cities have drive-thru coffee stands every few blocks.  There are so many we wonder how anyone decides which one to go to (and how do they make any money?)  We haven't seen these little huts many other places (there is a great one in Kahului, Hawaii on Maui island!) so when I saw that this one had popped up on Route 8, I'd been hoping to have a schedule that had me headed south some morning.  Such schedule came, and I'm glad.

We read the menu on the drive there, and realized we'd never had an iced Americano before.  So that was our first selection, and it was outstanding.  The coffee flavor was so rich and full and complete.  We got it with a little bit of cream but no sweetener or flavoring.  Of the iced coffees I've tried this summer, it had the best coffee flavor.  If I drove Rt 8 a lot, I would find myself strongly tempted by making this drink a habit.

We also got a latte.  Now since there was a Yelp coupon for a free flavor or espresso shot, and we have been experimenting with different drinks recently, we decided to get a shot of coconut flavor.  The reason I thought about 4 stars if because 5 stars means perfect and we didn't love this drink.  In the end, I went with the 5th star because the whole reasons we didn't love the drink was our own fault: we didn't like the coconut flavor!  Underneath it, however, we could tell that it was an excellent latte.  If I ever got another here, I would get it plain.  I personally think their coffee shines best plain, which is a huge compliment."}
{"text":"This play is great!   I wish that it was there while I grew up there.  It is now a must stop every time I come. I love to support local businesses that are doing it right!  The coffee is way better than the watered down DnD. Fast and convenient!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The drive-thru is so convenient, and the staff is very quick, efficient, and friendly. Every drink I've tried so far is delicious! The iced mocha is my favorite. I probably stop here and my way to work 2-3 times a week and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"I work on Route 8 about 10 minutes from BeanThru and my office mates and I are regulars. They're a little drive thru shack right off of 8 with a window on each side. Their menu is pretty big, offering a variety of hot and cold coffees and teas, smoothies, breakfast sandwiches, biscotti, cookies, and more. I've had a regular ol coffee and their cappuccino and both are great! The cappuccino is always drinking temperature which is really nice. They rotate their biscotti flavors; I've had vanilla almond, salted caramel, peanut butter chocolate, and red velvet. Vanilla almond and peanut butter chocolate were both delicious. I wasn't a fan of the salted caramel, and thought the red velvet had too much icing. Their Good 4 U bars are divine though; they're homemade bars made of granola, chocolate chips, and jelly; great with coffee! 

Service is quick and friendly, everything is usually made as asked (other than a couple days ago when one of my coworkers asked for an iced coffee but got lukewarm coffee with no ice? She said the person serving looked new though so, forgiveness!), and they always top your order with a chocolate covered coffee bean which is just cute and fun."}
