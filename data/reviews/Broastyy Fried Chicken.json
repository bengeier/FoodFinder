{"text":"Sorry the food is uninspired, service is good but how many bland chicken places do we need.  Popeyes is better and that's not saying Alot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken from New York Fried Chicken (former identity of Broastyy), so I was stoked to see this rebranded restaurant with, presumably, better food. This was not the case... 

I ordered the 7 piece with 3 sides combo (opted for fries, macaroni and cheese and a pop) for about $16 total. I originally wanted coleslaw but they ran out. This order also came with some sort of \"garlic sauce\" to dip chicken in. I really wasn't sure what this was, it tasted alright but kind of plain and I didn't need it. Unfortunately the chicken was not very good - it was over fried and the spices in the batter were really strange. My partner and I both thought of Indian style spices like cumin. Weird. Some of the pieces were dry, some were ok. The sides were mediocre. Fries were generic frozen brand thicker cringle cut, and the macaroni and cheese was tasteless and consisted of overcooked shell pasta. 

All in all a disappointment, especially since NY chicken was soo good. Not the worst I've had but I likely won't eat here again."}
{"text":"The newest fast food addition to the Bloor West Village is quite unremarkable.  A quick read of the take out menu had me worried from the very start.  Finding four spelling mistakes in a professional flyer makes me wonder.  

Went with a chicken combo which included a bunch of sides.  17 pieces of fried chicken, cucumber and tomato salad, rice, samosas, coleslaw and macaroni and cheese and lastly fries.   If my memory serves me correct it come to about $33 tax in.

Fried Chicken was greasy.  Fries were generic.  Macaroni and Cheese was revolting.  Pasta  was mush and the cheese was interesting to say the least (in a very bad way).  Coleslaw was ok.   Rice and samosas were fine.  

I asked for sauces for the chicken and directed to a basket containing packets of different sauces.  Asian style chili sauce, plum sauce, ketchup.  What a bore.   

Overall this menu is confusing.  It may be American style fried chicken but that's the only item that is.  Everything else has an ethnic feel to it and just doesn't work.  

From a value perspective you can't go wrong.  It is a boat load of food.  A boat load of really bad bad food.  

One star for value on their combos.  Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is now closed. They didn't pay their bills and rent - plus it wasn't very busy at all."}
{"text":"Worst chicken ever. I got grilled chicken which was cooked by the owner and when I got home and went to eat it, it was raw inside! It was cooked medium rare! Thats not cool for chicken. This place is going to end up making people very sick by the unsafe food practices they have. There is another location opening with the same owner and I can not picture it being any better!
  
   The rice is dry and tasteless. It likely sits in a steamer for hours. Don't waste money on crap food that is probably going to make you sick. Take your money and go to popeyes if you want *chicken*."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst meal I've ever had. I had a chicken sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese.  The sandwich tasted like moldy bread and the Mac and cheese tasted like starchy glue.  Wouldn't recommend this place to my #1 enemy.  Its the worst."}
{"text":"This used to be New York Fried Chicken. They appear to have re-branded, I believe I saw the same owner in the back.

You can get chicken fried or grilled, they claim it's 100% organic and Halal. They have \"Cones\" which appear to be just wraps. Sides include Samosas, rice, slaw, and salad. This is now a take-out place. They removed all the tables and have only two seats at a counter facing the window. Meals include three sides, all very generous portion sizes.

The spicing in the battered fried chicken has improved, and the meat was moist and tender. Naturally it was pretty greasy. Still no wet naps. The fries were pretty good with a nice spice mixture on them. They had a cucumber and tomato salad, a nice option. Very simple, just a bit of olive oil and vinegar and a light sprinkling of spice. 
Surprisingly the best part of my meal was the RICE! Fluffy and moist, I had the raisin rice, and there were nice plump raisins and the seasoning was delicious.

I'd come back if I had a fried chicken craving, since I live in the 'hood and it's the only place around. Will try a wrap and a sandwich next."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would... Where do I begin?

What I ordered:  Samosa, \"Fresca\" Fried Chicken Sandwich, 2 pcs of Fried Chicken and an Nestea Ice Tea. 

First off.. WOW, totally expensive for no good reason. 

The food was the worst food I have ever had in my entire life and I have eaten drunken Taco Bell at 12:00am in a parking lot on a Wednesday night.  

 After my girlfriend bit into her drumstick and exclaimed \"this is an odd spice on the chicken\"... I became curious as to what Broastyy had in store for me..

I first had the samosa (because I always like to leave my sandwiches to last haha), IT WAS FROZEN... not cold, not mildy chilled, but FROZEN in the middle.. I'm talking about icicles in the centre... literally.

But I ate it anyway because I was extremely hungry and just needed something in my stomach.

Now to the sandwich, oh boy... I opened the package and it was the first time I laughed at food.  To my surprise the chicken sandwich was layered with processed bologna meat, processed kraft cheese and stale bun.  I prepared myself to take a bite and promptly I spat it out, because it was completely horrifying.  So, I can go on and on about this sandwich and I will leave you one last thought:

MIRCLE WHIP IS DISGUSTING!!  and when you are using the HALAL grade to promote your fried chicken sandwiches, MAKE SURE YOU ARE SERVING ACTUAL CHICKEN NOT NO NAME CHICKEN PATTIES FROM LOBLAWS!!!!"}
{"text":"For some reason I was picturing this place being some one-off hipster place with old-school greasy chicken made to order. I didn't take a close enough look; it's really just another popeye-esque type franchise joint with mediocre food.

Granted I went in around 9:30-10, but the chicken in my combo had clearly been sitting around for a while and was reheated for the order. What's more strange is that it actually took quite a while. Maybe they were trying to trick us. The sides were all meh too (well, not sure I was expecting much from the sides anyway).

I'm told the mugshot tavern just a couple blocks west has some good fried chicken. I think I'll check that out next time."}
{"text":"The chicken is probably the best part of the meal and that is not saying much. The quality of the French fries is down since rebranding and most of the sides are better off traded for beverages. I'd say get a roti if you want chicken. Or hop over to the three speed."}
{"text":"This will teach me for not consulting Yelp before eating somewhere new... This place was utterly revolting and I am extra disappointed because their logo and colour schemes makes them look like an adorable mom and pop operation (damn you marketing!)

Recap of my visit:

- the samosa was frozen solid in the centre (I'm talking instant brain freeze)
- their chicken is basically raw
- they put BOLOGNA in their chicken sandwich (along with mayo and cucumbers)
- their prices aren't cheap at almost $10 a combo

All in all this place is not recommended!"}
