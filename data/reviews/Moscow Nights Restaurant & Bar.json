{"text":"If not for the music I'd give the restaurant two stars more. 
Pros: The food was abundant and of good quality. The lights were dimmed, but not too dark. Quite a large place for dancing. Short show was of quite good level, with health humor and good technique of the two performers. Polite and attentive staff.
Cons:  
it was very cold temperature at the first half of the party. Later on the hall was heated, but I think it was supposed to be done before the party started.
The main cons: as it was mentioned in one review below - extremely loud music! For many of us it just ruined the party, as it was really not only unpleasant, but painful for ears. At one moment I decided to measure the noise by app on my cell phone - it was sometimes reaching 102 decibels! For information: level above 90 decibel is classified as \"hearing damage\", and level above 100 decibel - \"serious hearing damage\". When I politely asked the singer to reduce a little bit level because \"on forte it was too many decibels\" his answer was not professional and rude: \"Do you want to show me you know musical terms?\" I don't think it is reasonable answer to  request of  customer. After my complaint to the restaurant owner, he reduced the sound, but very slightly (peak level was still 97 decibels). Another members of our party also asked one of the waiters to pass to the owner request to reduce sound level, but with no output. So after the party we left the restaurant with serious temporary hearing loss."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a colleagues farewell party. It was just the 14 of us in the whole restaurant which can hold about 100.  Paid 65 plus tip and it was a GREAT time.

The food:
Table was covered with delicious russian food that everyone enjoyed even though no one was russian. The food just kept coming and coming. Awesome. 

The booze:
We brought our own

The atmosphere:
We asked the guy to put certain types of songs and he did and by the end we were all dancing to rasputin by bonnie m.

Ah Those russians....."}
{"text":"I'm giving you fair warning: Be prepared for a massive food come.

The first comment I'd like to make...I thought Russians only ate like potatoes and vodka?

I think only one item on the table had potato..and there definitely wasn't any vodka...


Anyhoo,

Came here on Saturday @ 12pm..(umm...since when is there a 12pm on saturdaY??!!) for Ana's bday celebrations. She rented out the whole restaurant, so it was just us. Obviously I can't comment on the service from that. 

BUT THE FOOD YO.

It was awesome. I didn't catch any names or anything, but it was all laid out in front of us. So i will try my best to explain the highs and the lows.


1. THE CHICKEN KEBABS (which came out last) WERE A SMASHING GOOD TIME. 
2. The eggplant stuffed with magic + grilled was sooo good too. But there ain't never been an eggplant I didn't like.
3. The were these crepe packages. Soo good. Stuffed with chicken.
4. The wsa a potato salad thing. It was in front of me. NO ONE ELSE GOT SOME.
5. Smoked Salmon!!
6. A chicken breast COVERED in CHEESE. It was amazing.


Other Notes:

1. We brought our own liqour
2. IT BE FANCY YO. Dress up.
3. HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANASTASIYA."}
{"text":"This isn't the best Russian restaurant out there. When I say Russian Restaurant I don't mean portion controlled ethnic food...no.

At these kinds of places you pay per seat. They cover the table for you with aps, cold cuts, salads, BBQ, rice, potatoes, etc etc. - when you make the reservation you put down at $100 deposit. Everything is CASH. You can ask them to give you alcohol from their bar (which will be way more expensive) or you can bring your own (LLBO) and not pay any extra. (ask them about hard alcohol....I'm not saying anything about that but it can happen!)

Sunday brunch (12-430pm) is $40 per person - if you bring your own alcohol (ask your guests to pitch in extra for booze and tip which is 10%)

They have various selections on the menu - you can make specific orders if you know what you want. Otherwise they will give you standard. Desert is also extra so we brought our own - we = my mom made me yum yumz :)"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Russian restaurants, but this is a great place to go. As others said, reasonably priced for the amount of food you get and if you don't mind louder than usual music, it's well worth it.

We had a party of about 15 people and everyone left very satisfied with the meal. To start off, the table is covered with plates of food to the point that you can barely see the table. Always a good thing (this is a Russian tradition, by the way).

There were several delicious salads, some with seafood, some vegetarian (beet salad, really good!), as well as some marinated vegetables and smoked fish, which to me was the highlight of the table. Really nice, not too salty, fresh and melt in your mouth. I don't think I even tried everything on the table but it was really nice. There was a liver pate (house made, of course), which left a good impression on several of my friends.

After that, the food just kept on coming. There were puff pastries filled with potatoes, chicken and I believe cottage cheese. Light, flaky and again, fresh. There was a fish in a creamy sauce that was also flavourful, flaky and tasty (not sure what fish it was, possibly haddock or cod). There were some potatoes and rice as sides and then there were really tasty kebobs and I believe there was some lamb (at that point I was so full  of food and wine I didn't even try it but the others seemed pleased). 

The music was, as I said, a bit loud but overall pleasant and the musicians/singer are usually open to suggestions (if they are within their repertoire). They sing a variety of Russian and English (and possibly Italian, I'm not entirely sure) songs. There is a decently sized dance floor and the decor, though a bit old fashioned, is nice. 

Washrooms were clean, well stocked with toilet paper and paper towels (many reviewers omit this information, but I think it's a very good sign if those are clean and well maintained).

The hostess (?) was very attentive and pleasant, she was on top of bringing us fresh pitchers of water and coke the whole night long.

As mentioned before, you can bring your own wine (not sure about other drinks) and it's usually a good idea.

So, good experience, overall and though I don't live in the area, if someone I know wants to experience a fairly traditional Russian-Canadian restaurant, I'd say give it a try!"}
