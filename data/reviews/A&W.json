{"text":"Mozza burgers have always been & will always be my favourite burger. I loves my root beer & root beer floats. Good prices & friendly staff."}
{"text":"Très très bon burger , viande garantie sans ajouts , change des chaînes de fast-food !!! A essayer je vous le recommande"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the food court. Always open and their service is fast. Good friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is the best food joint in the food court always open 7 days a week and they serve fresh food right away. Love to go to A&W restaurant at Sheppard centre as I live just across the street. Worth the money that i spend."}
{"text":"First time at A&W - drawn by the caring process of food treatment and ingredients. Awesome service and friendly. Definitely a fan now  they made the burger protein style for me in the style of In-N-out.
Go here and get your burger lettuce wrapped baby!!"}
{"text":"We use the drive through- with a fairly large family, each person with a special request, out orders can be tricky.  They always get it right."}
{"text":"We wandered into A&W late one night when there was little else open.  While the menu and food quality is standard, the environment is not the A&W of my childhood.

Self-serve ordering is a fantastic addition that gives you the opportunity to customize your order without the guilt of confusing and complicating the order at the counter, root beer served in ice-cold glass mugs is perfect and the decor is a perfect combination of clean lines and current colours with vintage imagery."}
{"text":"The best A&W. Friendly staff and really fast service even when they are busy. Just wish they would bring back the foil bags for the burgers. The bags they use now don't keep the burgers very warm when doing take out."}
{"text":"A&W has terrible business practices.  I stopped with a friend today for a quick dinner and we each bought an uncle burger with a combo.   I used a 3.49 uncle burger coupon but I didn't realize that I was  charged full price for the fries and soft drink.  Apparently if you use a coupon you don't get the combo discount.  But nowhere in the restaurant did it state that the combo is not available when coupons are used.  This is quite misleading and even the staff agreed.  One cashier said they always get complaints about this issue but there is nothing they can do.  This is not about the dollar that I was overcharged but it is All about the PRINCIPAL."}
{"text":"Greasy onion rings, and when I mean greasy, I don't mean the NORM greasy, I mean't that as I was arriving home there was grease leaking out of the bottom of the bag.

The teen burger was my choice, I felt the burger was not well done.

Cute girl though."}
{"text":"My 4 year old son and I went here for breakfast this morning. We live nearby and have been many times. I have never been for breakfast on a weekday before. What a treat! 

The staff is very friendly. One of the customers who ordered after me was obviously a regular and the cashiers were trying very hard to remember her order from the last time she had been there. They got it mostly right! 

My son and I had Bacon and eggers and orange juice - always a favorite when we go. My husband has had their breakfast plate featuring toast, bacon and eggs on past visits. It is really tasty and reasonable too. My only complaint is that while changing the orange juice container, our sandwiches sat for a good minute or more on the tray, rather than under a heat lamp. I would have rather it sat warm than out on the counter - but my 4 year old was happy because he could eat it right away. 

This is obviously where the local retired crowd meets for coffee and a bite to eat, as we were the two youngest customers there. The place, however, was packed!!! There were numerous copies of the newspaper to read and one of the staff walked around with a basket of creamer and a fresh pot of coffee offering refills! For a second, I thought I was in a fullservice restaurant. 

 I will happily frequent the neighbourhood A&W when it is such a pleasant welcoming place to go."}
{"text":"Here is absolutely a good place to stay in hot summer afternoon. They provide free WiFi and air condition inside the store and some sunshades for the seats outside. From my experience,  less people are in the store in the daytime although it is located in a popular walking region. You may also take some coupons at the corner of street in the afternoon. There is usually a staff who gives coupon to walkers. The food is as usual as other A&W stores, nothing special."}
{"text":"I love A&W but this location is horrible. Because I work nearby I visit it quite often though.
I order diet root beer because I am diabetic but hardly ever get diet. I know u can make a mistake but every time??? Last time I reminded the guy while he was pouring and he quickly switched the button. Result the rootbeer was half foamy (no foam means diet, full foam means sugary) Another guy another time, same location also gave me the normal one realized it and poured it out and got me a new one. Sorry I really can't have any sugar!!!
They usually forget the chipotle mayo for the new sweet potato fries but I remind them every time and still they forget it... so I remind three times and check the bag. I try to order in French and I think I'm not that bad at it so I don't know where's the problem??? Oh I am usually there in the late evening. Maybe the day staff is more efficient..."}
{"text":"After saying no-thank-you to a couple of $15 sandwiches at one of the other shops, I ordered two teen burgers and a fries to go, for under $12. Very quick to get food and it was tasty. Kudos to A&W for not gouging the travelling public."}
{"text":"The Dub! - Teen burger, root beer, and onion rings (w/the crack-like seasoning they liberally cover their rings in); the perfect cheat meal! Don't forget the frosty mug for your root beer!"}
{"text":"I occasionally go to this location, every single time the food is great to eat. Never had an issue. They have wifi now, compared to the previous time I've visited which is good. Plus plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Got all the way home before I noticed they forgot my fries last night!! What a burn.

Granted it was 3am on a Friday night but was still very disappointed. Staff here are generally friendly and food is well prepared for a fast food joint.

Unfortunately, coupons never include the veggie burger.

This location is now open 24hours."}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good. They are better then McDonald's but not as good as Harvey's. 

You get served root beer in cold glasses so they don't use ice. Kind of a fun idea but when I have A&W root beer at home it taste just as good. 

My tip would be to sign up to their website and use the coupons."}
{"text":"I'll admit, fast food doenst really count as a restaurant in my eyes, but something about A&W keeps alluring me back to the opposite side of this notion.

I ordered the Uncle Burger with fries and a large root beer. I have to say, I was impressed. The burger has the perfect amount of mayonaisse and mustard with ketchup, and the meat was cooked proprely to a nice medium well. The rootbeer was freezing cold and just added to the experience.

Staff wise, they were very friendly, and I was expecting the typical rude lunch lady attitude. Total opposite discovered here!

The fries were cooked perfectly, not too crispy  but not too soggy.

I admit it, I was impressed. This place still makes a great old fashioned burger. Probably in my top 10 burger places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Patatine fritte alla perfezione, e come usa da queste parti, con la buccia!
L'hamburger era delizioso, io ho preso quello con il guacamole. Ottima anche l'idea di servire da bere nei boccali di birra ghiacciati e di servire le patatine in dei cestini di metallo."}
{"text":"I love the food at this fast food place.  I'm a fan of the chicken tenders which are juicy and fresh.  The homemade onion rings are the best.  They are coated with a special seasoning that gives them a taste all their own.  Coffee is very good and the root beer is served in a frosted mug which is their trademark.  All in all, a very good fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Homeboy always hooking us up, shouts to Vivien lmaoo - the oncle burger def be the realest hit that up"}
{"text":"This A&W runs a late night drive-thru which comes in handy when you're hungry after midnight and craving a double Mozza burger. That is the best thing on their menu, but sometimes a Papaburger with cheese does the trick.

What's with their burger family thing, anyway? I remember being in line one day contemplating the meaning behind a photo they had up of this cartoon family inside the top and bottom of a bun. That's just not right. I felt like someone might sneak up behind me and throw a huge foil wrapper over my head and cart me off to the kitchen. Now that would be weird....Where was I anyway? Yes, good burgers at A&W and at this one you can get them late...."}
{"text":"This is for the 733 Central Parkway West location by T&T  

My family and I frequent this establishment at least once a month because we used to dine here as kids and of course the coupons are hard to pass!   I don't really have any problem with their food nor its quality, rather its their staff.  I think they take the cake on LAZY and here's why:

Whenever I come to this place after 7pm, the washrooms are ALWAYS, always closed for \"cleaning\" *see pic.  I can't even go and wash my hands after touching money!  I finally asked the lady mopping and all she said is that \"its broken\" then I said I just need to wash my hands and she said its \"broken\" then I said \"fine, i'll just use the toilet\" then she said that was \"broken too\"  Somehow I find that hard to believe. I've been to this location handful of times and I believe I've only gone to the washroom ONCE in the day time.      

One night my husband and I came in 30 min before closing and they gave us really nasty stares.  I apologized and asked if they were closing (knowing full well there was 30 mins left) they said yeah they were without apologizing.  So we didn't argue and just left, we didn't want a loogey in our burgers after all. I would have understood if it was 5, or even10 mins before closing but 30!? Unacceptable, they aso turned down a family after us.   

Their ketchup pump is always empty, they love to just give out the packets so when we run out, we are forced to go and line up instead of just going to the station and pumping ourselves.  How lazy are they to wipe or even replace the ketchup dispenser?!?! 

My dad enjoys tagging along when we go A&W at times and he loves to order their rootbeer float.  We were sadly disappointed that we were given take out cups for our regular drinks and rootbeer float  when we decided to DINE-IN. ALL other locations I've been to, they always give you the glass when you dine in! So why not here? because the employees are too lazy to wash the old fashion glass! Its like buying a jewelry atTiffany's and skipping out on their famous blue box! (sorry couldn't think of a better comparison) 

They also only use one garbage bin instead of two or more.  I mean what's another garbage bag? It was so full one time, that the hinge wouldn't close and you can smell the garbage while you ate.

The employees also can't handle sudden crowd surge.  Its always so slow.  They seem to take care of drive through orders first.  I watched my food sit under a heat lamp for 15 minutes because the employees don't know how to multi task.  

Its sad to say that this has been happening for a while now.  Every time I go there it just gets worse and worse that I finally decided to take pictures and write this complaint.   

This location has nothing readily available like other locations.  No mugs, no ketchup dispensers, no washroom facilities, and closes earlier than normal operating hours!! 

Saw them in action when we were eating and they were closing in about 15 mins. They started mopping the floor right beside us and were told that they were closing.  We ended up packing our half eaten food and eating it in the parking lot.  2 mins later, we saw them locking up.  I used to work in the industry and we usually have to stay 30-1hr after service to clean up, but I guess they don't really have anything to clean.  They just pick up and go.  I'd like to meet the manager of this establishment and ask why he's letting this happen. Does he know or is he just turning a blind eye?  

Its a shame this place is really close to my place.  Lately, we've been making the extra 10 min drive to their Heartland location and have not had any problems.  This location needs to clean up their act."}

{"text":"Taste better than Mc Donald's burger.  I ordered 2 Mama burgers for $5.  The place is small. When I was there it was clean.  Polite service. 
I didn't felt so thirsty after eating the burger, comparing that to Mc Donald's burger.  A&W's beef patty is thicker and taste better than Mc Donald."}
{"text":"Update on this one:  They are too cheap to put a slice of tomato on their expensive burgers, if you want tomato it cost 50 cents extra.  Why do that when you can get almost the same burger at Wendy's across the street with tomato for less money.  

And the no ice thing?  I mean really...

Goodbye A&W..."}
{"text":"I'll let pictures do the talking. They have the worst worst quality of oil ever used in human history. They must have not changed it in a long while. I'm sure a&w head office do require oil changes within a set time limit. But there is no way this location is following rules set by head office. The onion rings and fries are sooo dark in colour. They taste sooo disgusting. If you look at the little smudge of oil dropped on my counter you can see it is darker in colour than even coke. Purely disgusting! Do anything to avoid this place"}
{"text":"Almost ten dollars for a very small, very poor quality cheeseburger and a drink? No wonder the place is almost empty."}
{"text":"As far as A and Ws go, this might be one of the best. The food is hot and fresh, the place is clean, and the staff is very friendly. 10/10."}
{"text":"Fast food not so bad... But still a fast food ;-)"}
{"text":"I find fast food burgers are all personal preference. My mama burger was decent - I appreciated the fact that my bun was lightly toasted and it wasnt squished.  The onion rings were nice and thick, but the coating was crumbly and fell off.  We had a coupon which made it better. I'd probably only go back if I was craving a root beer float and was close by."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing visit here yesterday. Personally I haven't had A & W for about 10 years before this visit and now I remember why. Really I only went because it was the closet place around at the time.

Upon first impressions staff was friendly and efficient when I ordered my food. Then I sat down and began eating, I was almost done my burger when I noticed a hair sitting on top of my beef patty. I was not going to say anything because I was trying to be understanding and not cause a scene but as a culinary school graduate who works within the food industry and is knowledgeable about sanitation and food safety, this is unacceptable to me as a paying customer. 

My mother who I was with brought it up on my behalf and was told, \"Sorry about that but she ate 3/4 of the burger so I can't replace it.\" Although I told her I understood that I believe there should have been some act of good will towards the customer. Now I feel like they only care about you until they have your money.

I ordered feeling optimistic about this company to never wanting to go back. That's a shame."}
{"text":"Most fast food joints are pretty much the same. Thie Mama Burgers with cheese were average and also 2 for 5$. The only thing was that I asked for no mustard on mine, which is what they did but probably in doing so, they forgot the cheese in the other burger.

Cheese really makes the burger too."}
{"text":"Best fast food you can put in your body. Tastes amazing and it is made from hormone free meat, cant go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Overpriced and skimpy servings. Root beer float probably has about a tablespoon of ice cream."}
{"text":"Great breakfast for a great price. Eggs taste like real eggs- not rubbery or bland like tims or McDonald's.  The price is great too. I just don't like their coffee, which is too bad. Now I have to make two stops for my breakfast..."}
{"text":"Burger was okay but the place was a mess!! not only that but it was dead and the young kid working there was just lounging playing on his phone. There was literally food on all of the tables, floors were strewn with debris, there were no ketsup cups left and this kid had the nerve to put out a tip jar. Hello a&w management, I don't think tips are appropriate for a fast food joint. Especially not one that's filthy dirty!!"}
{"text":"$9 (excluding tax) for a teen burger combo that was greasy, mediocre at best.  This is not gourmet, why are they charging gourmet prices?  This is a worrying trend among the corporate fast food giants charging big bucks for crap food.  Not sure what's happening."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for A and W - the burgers are awesome. Only until recently did I figure out which family member belonged to what kind of burger - until I got the grandpa burger and saw the massive 3 patty burger. So, the older and fragile you are, the more you eat?  Okay then. 

They should consider putting lettuce in all their family member though, as mine only had ketchup and mayo, with a sliver of pickle. 

The onion rings I find are so damn salty, yet I continue to order them. Sodium overload for sure - they need to consider cutting it down for those waist conscious people (aka, not me)

This place seems to give regular coupons, but at times, the store will have a better price than the coupon itself. Marketing fail. 

Overall, I love this place - and you should, too"}
{"text":"Worst A&W food of any location I have ever visited. This franchisee should have his/her license revoked. RANCID onion rings. STALE burger buns. WATERY, WARM root beer. All the food came from the warming bin and, from the taste of it, it had been sitting there a long time. If the A&W \"Root Bear\" ate here he would soon be throwing up into his tuba."}
{"text":"I'd like to state that the food is alright most of the times, the prices are average or maybe a bit below average if you have a big appetite. The service is something else though, never have I seen employees so unprofessional, rude and trashy. First off just today I saw the cook drop the fris cup then pick it up a minute later and use it for a customer's order. there's always a woman taking the order and regardless who it is they either mess up the order at least a little, and give you a LOT of attitude (sometimes even raise their voice while you're calm) when you complain about it, and insist that you are wrong EVERY TIME.
Fast Food restaurants will always get business that's why they don't give two shits about customer service however this place has certainly taken it to another level"}
{"text":"To be honest have never really looked at most fast food places as they are well fast food but this made me not want to return.. Not sure if just me but.  When front server is in the back where they cook and eating on the side where they prepare your food and then after eating not washing their hands and as they take the last bite they give your food to you bugged me. Then taking the same dish rag that has been by the cash for who knows how long wiping the counter and tables toss it back in same spot and again no gloves or wash hand the rest of your order... Sorry that was all that I saw before they went to the washroom... Thankfully I had my order. Burger was at best edible.. Not going here again."}
{"text":"Terrible and Slow Service. Declining Food Quality.

I eat here often as it's around the corner form my apartment and open 24/7.

Since opening its doors about a year ago, the quality of both the food and service have only declined. There are regularly mistakes made with both my order and my change.

Unless it's the middle of the night and nothing else is open, there are certainly better places in the neighbourhood to get a burger (Patati Patata, Burger Royal, Elses, etc.)."}
{"text":"The worst A&W I've ever had the misfortune of visiting.

I end up here often because it's open 24/7 and around the corner from my apartment. However, the food is frequently poorly prepared, and the staff is extremely slow and unhelpful.

Avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"I don't know what this particular location does to their onion rings, but they're awful.  It's almost like they're cooking them ahead of time and then throwing them back in the fryer to warm up causing them to be sopping with grease and have a lot less flavour than normal.  They need to visit the Eaton Centre location downtown to learn how they should be made.  The rest of the food seems standard."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars because the food was really fresh and good, but the drive thru service was soooooooo slow! Thank gosh one of my toddlers was asleep!"}
{"text":"this place has only been open for a few months and last week they pop machine was broken.i was happy for it to open so i could get there famous root beer float and milk shakes.but they do not have this there and there burgers taste really salty.they r very slow and get over welmed now that the school kids r back.took 20 mins just to get a burger.i wouldnt recommend this place to any one...i will say the girl that took my order was very polite and said sorry for the wait.the manager was so over welmed he no time to say anything to anybody about how slow they r there.A&W not having there shakes or floats is just not right..i no its a fast food outlet but atleast have what ur famous for there other wise its just a burger joint."}
{"text":"Standard A&W that is open 24h. I'm would it give 3-4 stars for food since it's pretty standard and consistent. All my past experiences have been alright but today draws the line. Rude and slow service at the drive thru and got yelled at because it wasn't the driver talking even though I was speaking loudly and articulating for a better understanding on the other side of the speaker. Long story short, don't go to the drive thru if you're anglo, one of the employee is just going to tell you that we're in CANADA (not quebec) and that we speak french, what a poor argument. Good thing that I was born here and was able to respond in french, my mother felt humiliated for not being able to be served in english and getting offended..."}
{"text":"Granted, it's A&W, and I don't usually eat at these types of fast food places. That said, I went in for a veggie burger. It was $5.50, which I thought was a bit high, and I didn't really like it. I got the onion rings and root beer combo, which put the meal over $11. Not worth it in my opinion and I won't be back. There are lots of better places nearby. Positives were that the people serving were nice. The onion rings are good, there were just too many for me to finish."}
{"text":"This was the dirtiest and most unprofessional place I've ever been too. Cook in the back had a Bandaid on her hand that was falling off. Noticed this as she emptied a bag or pickle juice into the cink at the front of the store. She then went to the back and was preparing food without a glove over the Bandaid hand. The floors and counters where the employees prep were absolutely filthy. 2/3rds of the restaurant was closed and blocked off because the tables hadn't been cleaned. The leftover tables where we could sit were absolutely disgusting. We walked out. Save your money and go to Fatburger."}
{"text":"Came to support as $2 from every teen burger supported MS today. I ordered the teen burger with poutine and hubby had the double teen burger with sweet potato fries as they ran out of onion rings. The restaurant is always clean and staff are polite. Whenever I'm in the mood for a burger but not taste like fast food, I can always rely on here especially when they are opened for 24/7 and located just off the highway."}
{"text":"This is the second time I come here for a bad breakfast
Cold eggs and a dirty coffee mug. Nasty , the service is always bad,in  this location . Under staffed and management seems to be  wiping the staff.
If you use a coupon for a meal and ask for a water as part of your meal they say they ran out of water. But if you  sit there you will see water being sold."}
{"text":"This location is new! It sits in an area that is heavy with late night, fast food competition, hoping people will pass up McDonalds, Pizza Pizza, etc. for A&W. Well, some friends and I did. 

My one qualm: for fast food, it's not very fast at all. They've got to sort this out stat. 

But as far as fast food goes, this is really up there! The burgers are thicker. You get a whole ring slice of onion. The bun seems toasted. If you get it to stay you can have your root beer in a frosted mug! Who does that?? Also your fries come in a reusable mini-deep-fryer-looking thing. So cute and environmental! 

I got a mama burger combo. The location is nice and central. This food is worth switching fast food places for."}
{"text":"En résumé, minuscule emplacement, employées in intéressées.  La saleté? C'est simple, partout! C'est un fast-food, 1 clients reste 10 minutes pour manger donc la table est sale tout les 10 minutes. Est-ce qu'ils ont assez d'employées pour passer aux tables en permanence? Évidemment non. C'est le pire A&W où je suis allé. Une honte sincèrement parce que l'emplacement est certainement très rentable pour le proprio."}
{"text":"Have started coming here perhaps every two two weeks for breakfast. Lady behind counter makes suggestions as to what's best value regarding special offers. To-day she came over to where we were sitting and asked how everything was. Haven't seen that before in a fast food chain."}
{"text":"My view of A&W was that it is a greasy spoon and you need a coupon to go there; in fact, it still is.  However, they have changed the perception of how bad of a greasy spoon they are by being the first to claim That their beef is steroid free, that their fried chicken is antibiotic free and that their coffee is organic amongst many other basic \"claims\" which are all true - BUT  all beef, sold at even the smallest of the burger chains, is steroid free and all chickens served at Canadian restaurants are free of antibiotics etc.  Being the first to make such claims in multi-million dollar ad campaigns on tv, radio, billboards and in-store has given A&W an image of a reinvented, wholesome, healthy fast food.  Well, it's all about perception, and it is working regardless of The fact that it is a greasy spoon and you need a coupon to get in there; enough said.

Now why am I still a fan? It's because A&W has, hands down, the industry's best (new) biggest single patty burger:  the uncle burger.  Everything else on the menu is crappy and greasy.  But the 6oz uncle burger is burger-goodness-at-its-best.  All other chains need two patties to make it a great big burger; the uncle burger changes the game and with the pepper seasoning and a diet coke to go with it, I'm in burger heaven for the ten minutes it takes to chow everything down and get the hell Out of there! It's still a greasy spoon and everything else on the menu is horrible, overpriced and... Greasy! (Hence why they put out buy one get one coupons in the mail
Practically every month of the year lol)

Located At the Pearson airport's Terminal1 post-security (at domestic gates D38-42), they have these nifty self-ordering automatic stations which let you customize the order and pay in seconds on the screen and wait till your order is called out and then delivered really fast.  Which is great as the fumes of the fryers and grease from the open kitchen are starting to invade my lungs; time to scoot over to the gate and board the plane without needing a jar of gravol to calm down any nausea lol.  Damn, this is a great burger!"}

-24/7 drive thru

{"text":"I love A&W but the service is very slow compared to Mcdonald's! The only place slower then A&W is Havey's"}
{"text":"I always end up here when I don't feel like cooking... usually after a workout, or like today, after a nap. I don't know where they find their stash of employees, but their young staff have a wonderful attitude, and they seem to care about good service.

It's typical A&W fare, which for me is sometimes a comfortable alternative to taking a risk at some of the other food joints nearby whose names change every few years. 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"I rate A&W more than any other burger joint (barr burger priest which hands down has best burger in the city)  but this branch in particular ive only been to a few times. Its not as clean as the other branches ive frequented but the food is still quality and has consistency. It also seems to have a pretty narrow design compared to other branches.

Its also open 24 hours making it super convenient ( I guess its because it has to compete seeing as hero burger and mcdo's right across the street from it and theyre 24/7 as well)."}
{"text":"Helt okej burgare för priset. Inget att hänga i julgranen men ändå bra fyllekäk eller mellanmål. A&W har inte överraskat mig tillräckligt mycket och jag tror att det är lite överhypat. Det smakar i stort sätt som Burger King gör. Goda lökringar dock!"}
{"text":"Granted, I don't know what I expected from a fast food chain like this but my onion rings were raw in the middle. Other stuff wasn't too impressive either. There are a few other restaurants nearby (Nouveau Système, Café Promenades St-Hubert) where the cost is lower and food is better and you're supporting local businesses that have been in the neighbourhood for decades."}
{"text":"Extremely rude couldn't understand cashier asked her to repeat herself she rolled her eyes and  acted like My business was a bother.  Define you will not return, prefer to go where my business is appreciated."}
{"text":"Recently opened A&W outlet in sheppard Yonge center is one of the best options available in food court. I am fan of their Spicy Habanero Chicken Burgers."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I know A&W usually isn't like this, because the many other locations I have visited were all just fine. 

We ordered 2 sandwiches without tomatoes, to go. When she handed them to me, I asked her, \"Are there tomatoes in this?\" She confirmed that they did not have tomatoes. When I got home, they did in fact have tomatoes. Not even a big deal, we just took them out; disappointing nonetheless. 

My burger had a hair in it. I know it didn't belong to me because my hair isn't a foot and a half long. The burger made me mildly ill, and my brother's made him severely sick. Worst experience I've had with any A&W. I won't be going back, and I suggest take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The experience was just wow!! From the time we walked in to the time we left we were treated like we mattered! Great food, great staff and management professional friendly making sure numerous times we were happy thank you for the wonderful food and service"}
{"text":"I would go to A & W more if there was actually a bear to greet me.

I've been getting a crazy amount of A & W coupons in the mail.
I'm a sucker for fast food breakfasts (once in awhile).

This location does have those cool self-ordering kiosks...
But I'm there, I might as well have someone take my order for me.
Saves me the trouble of having to type anything.

They have awesome, free cool coasters behind the kiosk!!!

The interior is bright and clean.
But it was super hot inside.
Way too hot.
Uncomfortable, stuffy, gross, hot.

And it might be because it's less busy than the McDonalds , but this place had a lot more homeless people than usual.

I took my breakfast back to the office.
We always wanted to compare McDees to A&W breakfast.
The A & W breakfast sandwich comes on a sesame burger bun.
Not a fan.  
I prefer McDonald's coffee.
I prefer McDonald's breakfast.

But if it's non-breakfast, I do like A&W onion rings and root beer.
2 star breakfast, 4 star other fried things =  3 star."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience.  On Saturday the 15th of April at 8.00 am.  I went down to order 3 egg and sausage meals two with orange juice one with coffee.  When I got home I noticed there was no hash browns.  When I called the store I was told it was not there fault and not to complain or they would ban me from this location.  Avoid drama and do not go to this location.  Since then I have spoken to the regional manager she was helpful.
Great food just no customer service."}
{"text":"I can't tell whether I'm just getting older or expecting too much from chain restaurants, but my experience here was terrible.

I can already hear it now. \"Alex, why did you order a salad from an A&W?\" Well, it was a place my friends and I agreed to go to, and I wanted a healthy menu option. I didn't know that I was going to wait for several minutes just to get a handful of lettuce thrown awkwardly into a take-out bowl with a sorry-looking excuse for a chicken breast and a paltry amount of cheese. Not to mention the root beer that was barely cold and a fry holder that had a piece of bread (from a bun?) stuck to the bottom of it.

I could go to a Subway any day of the week, and for the same price ($10) get a huge chopped salad with all the toppings I want. Not some half-hearted dish that barely qualifies as a side salad, let alone an entree.

And that's not even getting into how ratty the whole place felt or the fact that the woman who made my salad practically tossed it onto a counter. If you're too busy to make a salad, it shouldn't even be on your menu. It's not like there was much thought put into anything else, either.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwich is to die for! Much better than McD.
The food and service at this location is consistently good."}
{"text":"One of the best franchise chains for a burger in Toronto if not Ontario/Canada imho so I judge these locations assuming the food will be good to begin with

This location is nice enough. Nice people working here & service was fairly quick although they didn't have their condiment section fully stocked... No malt vinegar was there, just regular white & when I asked, the lady behind the counter was unsure what I meant til she asked the employee on the grill. That employee then gave me malt vinegar in a small condiment cup but neither made any move to fill a shaker with malt vinegar the whole time I was there. Also, that condiment counter's napkin dispenser was empty (though there were others around the restaurant that had plenty)

Locked bathrooms (they'll give customers the code) probably because it's downtown and they don't want homeless ppl/randoms to monopolize it & keep customers waiting. WiFi is also secured. I didn't ask for the password & didn't see it posted anywhere.

Lots of outlets for phone charging complete with USB outlets if you don't have an ac cube is a great touch that most A&W locations I've seen recently have"}
{"text":"The line up for A&W takes forever and a day. It's bad management as it takes about 15 minutes to even place an order and about another 10 minutes to get your order (Im talking about a Thursday evening here folks - not exactly too hard to handle). If the food here wasn't so cheap I wouldn't even bother coming back."}
{"text":"I usually come here about once a month when I go get my hair cut next door. I always come for breakfast and the service is always fast and friendly. I especially like the fact that the cashier will ask me to confirm my order on the screen before she rings it all up. A nice little touch. Food is always good, and my wife loves their pancakes and coffee. While the restaurant is not as busy as Mcdonald's, I actually prefer this more because I can have a peaceful breakfast and have a conversation with my wife where we both don't have to yell. I remember that I used to go to A&W for breakfast when I was a kid, and I'm glad they kept up the quality of service all these years. Definitely will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I go to A&W due to my bad habits of craving deep fried onion rings and cup of root beer. I recommend order the onion rings cooked well done (as extra crispy)."}
{"text":"Ever since I found out they serve breakfast sans breakfast sandwhich I've been coming back whenever I need a hardy meal before driving off to do weekend errands. The meals can be slightly warmer but under $10 the serving size and real eggs and real tomatoes on the side really make it worthwhile. I've been getting the 3 cheese omelette when I don't feel like loading up on meat first thing is the morning. Comes with 2 slices of toast, friend hash brown and 2 slices of tomatoes. I usually order their freshly squeezed orange juice too and it's awesome they serve it in their frosted mugs! 

If you want a break/change from that Ikea breakfast try this joint out!"}
{"text":"This A&W has spoiled me, and I don't think any other will ever live up to the experience.  For the first time in my life, the meal I ate actually looked like what was pictured on the menu.  Crazy, huh?  The fries came in a little basket, the drinks in frosted mugs, the burgers fresh and hot and delicious.  It's no Ritz, don't get me wrong, it's a fast food place, but it's fast food like I imagine it to be.  So for the odd indulgence, this was amazing.  I will have to go back another time to make sure that this wasn't a fluke, that it is consistently good."}
{"text":"Really tasty Teen Burger, or any burger, really.

The place is not your average McDonald's, they prepare your food with care and pay lots of attention to details. The home sauce is evenly spread across the whole burger and added just the right amount, unlike some other fast food restaurants where you get one side of the burger overloaded with mustard and the other side with nothing.

A&W's decor is always so cozy and homey, the place is clean and really well designed. Bar stools are pretty comfortable, and the restaurant is well lit.

The self-service is also available in this place, you can customize your burgers in anyway you'd like using a touchscreen."}
{"text":"Just awesome!!!

It is a newly opened business, which opens 24/7! Finally something other than McDonald's one can enjoy at a very late evening.

The food was really good, and they even have a self-ordering system which you can create your order and customize it on a touchscreen computer, fancy!

Looking forward to return for more A&W goodness."}
{"text":"i love the type of bread the burgers come on! they are delicious, not too hard, and hold the burgers in them!

Veggie burger was okay, nothing special but tasted good with the sauce and lettuce and onions. I liked the grilled chicken sandwhich better--much better flavor however its really small. Both burgers are way over priced ( at almost $7). and the onion rings are gross, over cooked and wayyyyy too salty. Great spot for drunk food otherwise, and open 24/7. They serve you quick--guess thats the point for fast food. =D"}
{"text":"Bright, clean, new location. Has an express ordering till. 
From the exterior its not as recognizable as the others. I assume its to fit in with the architectural controls of the surrounding mall.
The service is good and the restaurant itself is clean  (for now). Hope they keep it up.

As far as A&W's go this is my favorite one so far lol."}
{"text":"So fresh and so good! Excellent service from employees that take pride in their work!"}
{"text":"I was heading home from work late at night (11:30pm) and had to fill my car's tank. I then realized that I needed to fill my tank. Fortunately, this Petro Canada has A&W INSIDE,  so I ordered a mama burger combo and one for the hubby. The staff are polite and professuonal at this location, and the food was perfect. The fries were hot and fresh and the burgers were tasty! Well done A&W at Petro Canada, I was quite impressed with the service tonight."}
{"text":"I recently had a root beer and a teen burger at A & W. It was much better than the meals that I have had at the other major burger chains in Brampton. Onte other hand it was not as good as the burgers at the high end burger joints in the City. For the price, it was very good value."}
{"text":"Went to A&W for lunch today and everything was exceptional.  The cashier lady (Tashie?) went out of her way to make sure we are well served.  The root beer came with the -15 degree freezing cold mug that literally turned the foam of the root beer into fine delicious slushy.  I usually do not drink cold drinks, especially in the winter AT ALL, but I kept going back to my hubby's root beer.  The sweet potato fries and onions rings came in reusable containers and were crisp and delicious.  The wrappers of our burgers came in compostable package. The burgers were beautifully done.  The seating area and the restrooms were clean and brightly lid.  It was such a welcoming experience.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Have never eaten at A & W before so with all the TV advertising I went with a coupon and purchased the Grandpa Burger which is a triple burger. Sorry to say it is among the worst burgers I have ever eaten. The meat had a smell that did not seem fresh and their were almost no condiments on the burger. Their was a couple of pickles and a few onion crumbs and tomato sauce on the bottom of the burger which was so small in portion that it was barely visible and could not be tasted with the mass of meat above. The bun was also much too small. And this on a burger they sell for over $8. Needless to say I will not be returning to A & W and with so many better choices I would suggest you not bother either."}
{"text":"This review is for the teen burger I recieved. It improved a lot since the last time I came here but it remained dirty.

The whole A&W company itself had worked on rebranding and reintroducing their items at affordable prices with higher quality ingredients. I would go here instead of Mickey's D when they have promotions. 

Anyway the burger was good better than my experience at Holy Chucks which costed $12 dollars just for a burger. But this location compared to the other ones don't hold a standard like the other franchises. The bread wasn't toasted well enough and they don't use fresh crisp tomatos. The bread is slightly more greasy than the other locations. 

A&W  Canada is doing well. This location just need to match their standards."}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment. The Asian cashier with glasses is incredibly rude and nonchalant about everything. I get it, it's a fruitless job, but you don't need to be a dick to everyone."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick bite before class and thought that i would pop in to this aw. I would say that AW customer service and food quality are aligned to each other. Not only i can get bad customer service but also crappy food! I didn't even know that this was such an executive restaurant since i was told to leave after only staying there for 20min. Im so sorry that my tiny mouth cannot finish a whole combo in 5min sir. Not only the burger was dry, the worker wouldn't give me vinegar. Anyway, i would only  recommend going to this aw if you want to feel pissed."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my kids while visiting family in Brampton. It was a really fun experience and the food was really fresh and tasty. I loved the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Used to fall in love with their breakfast. Mouth watering and yummy. The bacon is too crispy and they will offer u with peanut butter . Need to change the light in washroom and need to clean more . Or else everything is perfect here."}
{"text":"Have you ever been so fucking bored at your dead end job? Sitting there on an evening shift contemplating suicide while the rest of the population is at home enjoying a peaceful spring evening? And the only thing you have to look forward to (other than dying) is the measly 30 minute lunch break where you can leave your dungeon and see the sun?
This is my life. I live this 6 days a week and for those 30 minutes a day I have one thing to look forward to.
If a kiss were a raindrop, I'd send it showers. If hugs were a second, I'd send it hours. If smiles were water, I'd send it the sea. If love were a person, I'd send it me.

I am talking of course, about A&W's chipotle mayo.

This exquisite dipping sauce is the fedora to my neckbeard, the milk to my cereal.

Because of my short and strict 30 minute break, It is a must that I pick up my order from the drive thru. This is fine because whilst driving and listening to My Chemical Romance on the way to the restaurant, I get a tingly feeling inside. And once I drive over the hill and see the large A and W letters... I can't help but out a sigh of relief.

With coupon in hand, I place my order with an extra side of chipotle mayo. I take my food, turn up my Chemical Romance to 11 and wipe the last tear from my cheek because I now have her.

Now, the hardest part is driving home with that greasy bag of food sitting on your passanger seat. You will have an unbelievable urge to drive into oncoming traffic so you don't have to go back to your depressing job and listen to how your fellow coworker is going to the local sporting event tomorrow with their infant daughter. Or have pictures of the \"cute\" outfit she wore on the first day of fucking preschool slammed in your face the same way a pair of testicles is slammed into a cheap hookers face.

But once I get back to work, all is well for the 3 minutes it takes me to inhale my meal. Then it is back to hell until tomorrow."}
{"text":"First time eating A&W..... Simply amazingly fresh. The beef was real tender and juicy, it was actual meat. We ate the combo of 2burgers for 6$ made to a combo for about 10$, overall very good fast food. 
Establishment was a bitndirty but didn't care too much for I was enjoying my meal."}

{"text":"What can I say, This place is perfect. As a John Molson Student, Location is 5*, All their burgers are awesome. Staff is great, Order to pickup can vary from 1 minute to 3 minutes ( depending on the hours, peek hours 3 minutes), Now that's extremely fast. for a Normal Combo 9.94$ (Hard to Beat). 
As Cheap as Mcdonald's but you feel like you're eating Real Chicken/Beef.
Great Job A&W ! Keep it up !

{"text":"The food is way overpriced and the service is bad. The servers are to busy inside gossiping instead of serving the customer and the manager is very rude...... On the other hand they do have the best burgers and fried mozzarella sticks. Lol"}
{"text":"They have the worst onion rings ever. I don't know why I ate most of it. So fucking gross and salty. Oily as fuck and unappetizing!"}
{"text":"The latest in a collection of burger joints at the venerable Queen St. W. and Spadina corner, this A&W is the latest chain to establish itself. The old building that houses it used to be Gorilla Monsoon Lounge with Noise Annoys Record store upstairs and is right next door to the legendary Horseshoe tavern. It doesn't take much of an imagination to see how quirky Queen St. is changing to more of Canada's largest street mall with A&W taking over a profitable location across from McDonalds. The narrow space has a long counter with stools for catching a quick bite and sharing the experience with whoever else is there. In the middle is the order counter with more stool seating towards the back. The space is well lit, modern and has many graphics with nostalgic A&W icons from the past. On the wall there are coasters with more graphics from A&W that could be snapped up as 'souvenirs' of your visit. The interesting aspect to this location is the upstairs. To your left as you walk in there is a staircase that leads up to the 2nd level that has washrooms and a seating area if more privacy is preferred. Small windows from the old construction (glad they didn't do a full demo to change them) let you peer out over Queen St. This is what sets this location apart, good for you A&W !!"}
{"text":"The greasiest shit hole. Go for pizza instead or walk up the street. The food here must not be sanitary because it gave me food poisoning. Sick for days after eating here, avoid at all costs, save yourselves."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and the service was terrible! We waited in line for 10 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of us. Fast food that is slow is just bad food."}
{"text":"Breakfast is fast! Liked the all Canadian breakfast, about 10 bucks. Got diet root beer everyone I order."}
{"text":"Beware this pit , it was the worst food ever! The Mama burger consisted of a slab of onion with flat turd pretending to be a real burger!  Avoid this hole at all cost. What a shameful comment on a once loved company ,that must   have died long ago in my happy past."}
{"text":"Came here during the day when it wasn't too busy, hands downs the slowest and worst service I've had. No one wears gloves and they touch the food with their bare hands. It took 10 minutes to get a buddy burger. I'm pretty sure apes have more hygiene and better coordination."}
{"text":"This A&W has the best staff and the freshest tasting burgers from any chain. I always get what I order and the inside is clean every time I go in."}
{"text":"I ordered a Papa Burger and Onion Rings and a Diet Root Beer.

I have come to discover that the burgers at A&W are superior to most other fast food establishments. The burger actually tastes like high quality beef.

The onion rings are some of the best you can find anywhere. They are served in a mini fryer basket if you are eating in and they are plentiful.

The root beer was served in an ice cold glass mug. Great!!

So why isn't this a 5 star review. Because this was not close to a 5 star experience.

When I walked into this restaurant it was my first time there. It's a good things that there were pictures on the menu and the order taker spoke English because there isn't one word of English on any sign or on this menu in this particular establishment!!  Really A&W? I am visiting from the USA. I guess you don't want my business so if I walk into another A&W restaurant anywhere in Montreal and the menu doesn't have at the least a description of the food in English like 99% of other restaurants in Montreal then I'm turning my ass around and going elsewhere.

There were other issues. The restaurant was a mess. In spite of their being only one or two other customers and no orders in process, none of the staff was cleaning up. You could see food and other garbage strewn across the floor kitchen area. There were many empty tables and most of them needed to be wiped down. I was about to say something to the manager but he was too busy pacing across the restaurant talking on his cell phone (see photo attached).

Come on A&W. I have been coming to your restaurants since I was a child - for more than 50 years and I have never felt so unwelcome or displeased at the cleanliness of the establishment. We all know what happens when the management doesn't care about the appearance of their restaurant, the quality of the food starts to suffer."}
{"text":"I just love A & W burger in general, and today $3.50 Teen Burger was just another reason why I must one.  The decor was homey and bright.  I guess now all the stores have the self served POS machine to purchase your order.  The poor staff was all by himself taking order and packing order as well for a rather long line up.  i waited for almost ten minutes in line, but the staff was really courteous.  So, I was ok with the wait.  I guess this is not really fast food.  The burger was really tasty with crunchy lettuce, and juicy burger and the burgers buns were amazing.  Not bad at all.  I would have given this place one more star if the wait was shorter.  I think they need to consider to hire one more staff to cover this shift."}
{"text":"Good on a coupon, keep walking if you don't have one.  Way overpriced otherwise (example: $8.25 for a Teen Burger combo)

Love that you get your root beer served in a cold, frosted glass if you \"dine-in\".  The burger was fine for fast food, fries were also okay.  Service was insanity - the place was packed to the brim and they only had one girl on cash and one guy making all the food.  Got the burger and drink well before the fries.  Bathrooms were disgusting and you need to get \"buzzed in\" to use them."}
{"text":"Decent burger option at Spadina and Queen.  Came here before a movie for two momma burgers for $6. Not quite the dollar menu at MacDs, but decent. I like A &W and there burgers taste a little less chemical than most."}
{"text":"A and w is, and always will be, the place to go for root.. beer. But their burgers and other fast food offerings are still pretty good. They now serve sweet potato fries, thick cut onion rings, and homestyle fries . They also happen to be my favourite fast food place for breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints. They are reasonably cheap and taste better than a Whopper or a Big Mac. They promote their patties to be \"antibiotic-free\" and \"steroid-free\" beef. 

My only gripe with them is that I find their burger a bit more salty than their counterparts. But I guess you can always ask for less seasoning. 

This place is located inside the Neighbours Gas Station. They also have a drive-thru. Service is quick and efficient. 

So if you want your burger fix but want to feel more guilt-free compared to the other big fast food chains, and don't want to spend more on a gourmet burger (ex. Five Guys) this is the place to go. 

Also, With the current online coupon you can get 2 Papa Burgers for $6!"}
{"text":"If you are afraid of the evil clown phenomenon that is ongoing and/or avoiding Ronald McWhat's-his-face, yet looking for a place for a good fast food breakfast sandwich, look no further than A&W!
A & W's \"bacon and egger\" or \"sausage and egger\" sandwiches on an English muffin Kick.Clown.Butt! 
A freshly cracked cage-free egg from hens raised on a vegetarian diet, tasty, well-prepared, antibiotic-free, locally-sourced strip bacon or sausage patty, all on a well toasted English muffin, reminds you of what an Egg McMuffler might have tasted like before underpaid 16 year old kids started preparing them on an assembly line.
Plus they have a FAR superior hash brown patty, a' la' Cavendish, which I always put INTO the sandwich, with a little bit of ketchup, (French's ketchup, made in Canada, thankyouverymuch) and I am in breakfast McMuppet heaven!
Trust me, ignore those who complain, and try this breakfast sandwich and you will never go back to eating McMudflaps ever again!"}
{"text":"Since I was a kid love the root beer their best route beer he ever does solar love their hamburgers"}
{"text":"I don't mind saying, I like A&W a lot. I think their menu is solid, and a certain amount of care is put into their meals, even if it is fast food. However, this particular location has given me problems more than once. Maybe it's the fact that it's open 24/7 that has completely rocked this place between the shoulder blades, but something's missing.

One time I went there in the middle of the night for just 1 Teen burger. No onion rings or drinks or anything, just a burger. I was told that it may be a few minutes (no explanation why), to pull ahead, and someone would be out to bring me my food when it was ready. Well, I ended up having to wait around 15-20 minutes before the girl finally came out (apologetically, mind you), and that was it.
Now, I'm not one of those people to get all cray-cray over having to wait for food, but if I'm getting fast food in a drive-through, I expect it to be prepared fairly quickly. I'd wager that even the Burger Family would be pissy over a wait like that. I've also noticed differing levels of food quality over the times I've been there, which can be easily dismissed because it's fast food, though I've never had this issue at any other A&W. 

It's funny that this stuff happens at this location, since it's in the same plaza as Denny's (where you do have to wait, but for higher quality food), which neighbours McDonalds (crappy food given to you in milliseconds). You'd think between the 2 of those 24/7 threats, A&W would be furiously stepping up their game. Maybe some day. Come on bear, get it together!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are staying at the Best Western down the street.  We've been to this A&W twice now during our stay.  Once for supper and once for breakfast.

During our first visit I realized that the Manager on duty was actually the owner.  This location is very well run and it is nice to see the owner actively involved instead of sitting an office somewhere.

Words to describe our supper visit are, hot. fresh, and quick.  (Except of course for the frosty mug of cola.)  :)

Most of the time when I do breakfast at an A&W I'm in the drive-thru and order a breakfast sandwich that's easy to eat while driving.  This time we actually ordered proper breakfasts that included eggs, hash browns, toast, and coffee.  I was pleasantly surprised to see my meal come on a proper china plate with real metal cutlery.

This A&W is now on my official list of places to drop in when I'm traveling between Edmonton and Calgary."}
{"text":"I am quite impressed by this place before even trying it out. I drive by every week at some point and it amazes me how A&W managed to not junk up a beautiful piece of real-estate by putting fast food in it. In fact it fits right in and seems to add a quaint splash of class to the corner. Maybe I'm just nostalgic about A&W as I get older. 
I finally went inside to get food this week and enjoyed the service, it's nice to be called by your name not a number. I hardly go into A&W anymore so I had no idea what to order but I told the staff member I'm gluten free (not celiac) and dairy free and we worked out a burger solution for me. They do lettuce burgers (lettuce around your beef instead of bun). That is such an amazing solution, and so easy to do that I'm surprised more places don't do it. Anyway, this is a great location; stylish, clean, friendly, and delicious. I will be making this place a regular part of my week."}
{"text":"This is probably the best a&w in calgary.  Friendly service and excellent food... yes, It's better then other a&ws and yes it's different. Fresher ingredients and cleaner environment."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. From terrible customer service to terrible order taking to terrible order filling, to terrible everything.  We took my three year old for breakfast on a slow Sunday.  As usual, the order was wrong, the restaurant was not very clean, the garbage was overflowing, and three dimwits were running the drive through. No one cares about the people in front of them whose eggs were getting cold because they weren't given a fork to eat them with. 

As we were leaving, my son fell on his face because one of the dimwits just mopped the floor and didn't put out a sign. As I looked at the counter, they were just standing around with mouths wide open, not a word. One of them ran to the back to get the sign to cover his ass. 

After speaking to the manager, nothing came out of it. Don't go here. Don't go ever. Unless you want to fall on your face too."}
{"text":"A&W, short for AWESOME! We need to have fast food chain like A&W in NYC! Love everything about the burgers--good portion, fresh and delicious. Opens 24hrs... Even at 3am in the morning, the burgers are just as good as the ones at 9am! Burgers at 9am?? That's right! Sometimes, I get bored of having the same typical breakfast I find everywhere... and I just want to have a full hearty meal to get me through the morning... but we all know that fast food chains in NYC do not serve lunch menu during breakfast time. Nope, not here... not at AWESOME! Of course, A&W is not only known for the burgers, but also the classic signature root beer. Thumbs up!!"}

{"text":"Il y a plusieurs mois, je m'étais présenté à ce \"restaurant\" en finissant de travailler un samedi soir aux alentours de minuit. L'employée à la caisse avait été incapable de me répondre en français ou même de comprendre ce que je lui disais en français. J'avais tout de même passé ma commande en anglais puis j'avais écrit un message depuis le site internet d'A&W concernant l'obligation au Québec de pouvoir être servi dans mon choix entre les deux langues officielles. Le gérant m'avait répondu le lendemain que l'employée en question suivait un cours de francisation et se débrouillerait bientôt suffisamment pour pouvoir même répondre en français. J'y suis retourné ce soir (6 ou 7 mois plus tard) et la même employée était en poste et elle ne comprend toujours pas un traitre mot de français. Elle n'a même su répondre à mon \"bonsoir\". Je suis cette fois parti sans consommer. Je suis pratiquement bilingue et j'ai des bases dans deux langues supplémentaires. Je suis fier de mes deux langues officielles et de leur mariage au Canada. Malheureusement, ne pouvoir recevoir de service dans ma langue maternelle dans une ville et une province principalement francophone n'est pas acceptable selon moi."}
{"text":"Standard burger fare, but this location turns it up a notch by having a big parking lot, a drive thru as well as lots of comfy seating inside and out.

It's 24 hours so that's also great.
They have newspapers available most times I'm there so great for breakfast. 

Last neat item is they serve their drinks in either coffee mugs or cold beer mugs for the root beer."}
{"text":"Not worth visiting unless it's late and there's nothing else open (they're open 24/7) or you have coupons, since the base prices are exorbitantly expensive for a shitty fast food restaurant. 

You'll pay over $11 for a standard combo and Burger's Priest this is not -- but they price it like it is. If you're there after 10PM, they won't give you a frosted mug, which wouldn't be so bad if they actually had ice to put in your flimsy cup. Warm, flat pop in a flimsy cup.

The fries were fresh cut at some point, but have since been frozen and taste like stale mush. The burgers are dry and crumbly and have way too much sauce on them. The onion rings are super-salty and it's hard to eat more than a couple of them as a result. 

The staff are terrible. There was a young Indian girl (I'm only mentioning ethnicity so they can be identified, as I didn't get their names) on cash who was new and she got berated in plain view for a good 10 minutes by a black girl for an earlier mistake while the lineup got longer and longer. It was painful to watch."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh and tasty. A great alternative to McDonald's, with a Root Beer option!"}
{"text":"This was the most mediocre eating experience I've ever had. Soggy fries. Cold burger. Wilted lettuce. Burger and fries was over $12. Wish it was a better experience."}
{"text":"Had coupons from the mail expiring in a couple days so decided to try this place.
Also never tried their habanero chicken burger.

This is a pretty big location, with a second floor full of seats.
There's an automated ordering machine located near the front, which is always interesting to see since I enjoy seeing automation in the workplace.

Burger was prepared pretty quickly after ordering.
Went a little after 1 PM so it was pretty empty. Headed upstairs to take a look and there was a huge poster for the habanero.

Upon revealing the contents of the wrapper, the burger looked pretty much as it is advertised, which is something I usually don't see when it comes to fast-food burger chains. I definitely don't see it when I get McDonalds, or Burger King, or Harvey's..

In terms of flavor, it's not really spicy at all. Maybe it's the sauce they use that has a little heat.
But the taste was enjoyable. It's not a substantial burger, but that's not surprising.

It's not bad for a snack."}
{"text":"Ali Z's recommendation to save money and calories by preparing your own meal is well-heeded by most air travelers. Be sure to chow down on your gourmet goodies before you hit the unsmiling security people who confiscate your roasted red pepper tapas or cilantro chicken wrap for themselves. 

Unless, of course, you just spent the last 3.5 hours traversing the Prairies without so much as a corn niblet or a sushi rice grain in sight. Weary beggars in this era of no-meal airlines cannot be choosy, especially on a 57 minute layover. After stumbling off the WestJet ramp, the beau and I fixated on the food court signs and mulled over an array of options spread out before us. 

After dithering between Subway and A&W, the novelty of root beer and crunchy onion rings won us over. Prices for a simple meal of a Mozza burger, onion rings, and a drink tip the scales above average, but raging demons of appetite will consider dining on a cardboard fry box if properly seasoned by ketchup and a ripple-cut dill pickle. What I got wasn't pretty or impressive, just a pile of lettuce and cheese slapped between two pasty white buns paler than Billy Idol's derriere in February. But it did the trick, being heated (I suppose they learned to operate the grill in the week since Ali went) and suspiciously crunchy fry stubs to delight any toddler. I think maybe three of the eponymous French nubs actually qualified as fries by even a generous definition.

On the other hand, French fries -- together with avocados -- have become my secret weakness while I'm expecting, so French nubs might be better to my health all around. I couldn't tell you whether they were actually tasty, given they exuded more heat than flavour. 

A&W loses a star for being stingy with serviettes and offering none at their counter (seriously?), overloading their drinks with ice in a subterfuge I come to strongly resent, and the cashier looking cross-eyed at my beau when he asked if his root beer flavoured ice might come with a refill. It's an honest question. She was serving up beverages worthy of walruses, and supposedly it is a criminal offense to inquire.

On the plus side, check out the neat Canadian airport memorabilia on your tabletop. Lots of hidden gems there about Canadian aeronautic pioneers help enliven a travel-tired mind."}
{"text":"I had a couple of really great burgers here, and then one of them wasn't as good as the others. I had taken it to go so when I got home I called the owner and he made sure that I was happy the next time and he bought me a sandwich. I feel like they really try to make a great product every time."}
{"text":"5 star experience for fast food? When rating according to value, why not?

In the past couple years, A&W has cemented themselves as the best fast food place in my experience. They've always been good, but they've increasingly been improving the quality of their food and I'm amazed at their quality control measures since the food always comes out as advertised, at virtually every location. The food's always fresh and properly proportioned.

First off, their breakfast is a hidden treasure few know about. Again, it has to come down to the quality of the food, because the sausage and egg just tastes so much better than the completion. It actually tastes better on a bun than an English muffin, though I believe they now offer that choice. I always recommend asking for a tomato slice. You can still get a traditional breakfast platter, which includes meat, toast and egg.

The burgers are great and I love the seasoning they have for the beef. The veggies are always fresh and I like having leaf lettuce, rather than cheap shredded lettuce which always involves a mess. Love the fries, but the rings are awesome. They're without rival in the fast food world and even better than most restaurants. I also love their dine-in touch of having a basket for the fries and frosted mugs for drinks. The chicken burgers are great too.

This is a basically a review for the entire company; however I'll add that everything above applies to this location. It's nice and open spaced. In spite of being newly opened, they've coped without showing any issues. They've also picked a great location since it's in a very central and busy location."}
{"text":"I was in a hurry to get somewhere but needed something to tie me over.  The changing menu flashed a pic of a $2.99 Buddy Burger...a perfectly seasoned 1.6 oz 100% pure beef patty (raised without the use of hormones or steroids) topped with freshly grilled onions, ketchup, mustard and Teen sauce, served on a freshly toasted bun.  Subliminal advertisement? Okay, I was weak and overcome with hunger...  In and out quickly but it did the job!"}
{"text":"I've said it in other reviews, but I think A&W is about the best there is for chain fast food burgers. Within that context, they deserve 5 stars and this place maintains their reputation for good service, fresh quality food, and a clean location. This location seems to be increasingly busier over the past couple years which suggests others feel the same. Best fast food breakfast too."}
{"text":"I try to avoid burger chains but if I have to eat one I go to A&W. Their burgers are tasty and apparently they use meat without hormones and antibiotics."}
{"text":"I love A&W. All of them. Out of all the fast food chains, they are my favourite. This location is just as good as all the others, PLUS they have a 24-hour drive thru!! This makes me sad, but also really glad, that I don't live closer.

Like most locations, this one is clean and the service is pretty good. You get your root beer in a giant, frosty glass if you're eating in. The food is the same as all the other locations, just bad enough for you to be considered junk food, but not so bad that you feel like you ate a trojan horse full of acid and food poisoning. The fries were also very crispy! 

In addition to cash credit cards, you can also use PayPass here, for when you want your fast food even faster."}
{"text":"It's a good place I think but just always make sure to check ur receipt before u leave Cus after all they are humans An make mistakes sometimes."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for lunch and got what I expected: burgers, fast service and lots of root beer. The A&W provides a fast lunch option in the Bolton area if you a craving a burger buy don't want to go to the Mc Donald's across the street. Also its a great location for anyone staying at the Hampton Inn which it shares a parking lot with. 

Their burgers are cooked well and fully serviced with lettuce, tomatoes and the works, making it a pretty juicy burger overall. If you dine in, they serve you soft drinks in the trademark A&W mugs, which keeps your drink nicely chilled. Also if dining in, don't forget the special seasoning for the fries. 

Overall, a good place for the better side of fast food."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think A&W has the best fast food breakfast around here.  Their hashbrowns are probably the best.  That sausage and egger sandwich is rather tasty.  The coffee is decent.  Whats not to like.  The place is clean, the quality is consistent and the parking is plentiful.  The service was efficient and courteous and the price is right.  So now I'm a big fan of their breakfast.  The young yelper helper and i will be back soon."}
{"text":"Disgusting.

I bought two Mozza burgers with a coupon and bit into one hungrily. Unfortunately the beige, lukewarm patty permeated my mouth with an unpleasant, gristly taste. It went down the chute of my condo unfinished, along with its untouched twin.

I'm not sure if this is an especially bad A&W, and I don't really care. I'll never walk into an A&W again."}
{"text":"ONE STAR... because I couldn't give 'em NO STAR!

Me and Shitty Michael ate there today and couldn't believe the nonsense!

Cashiers yell at you \"NEXT!!!\" and then don't bother listening to your order... Made me feel stupid and laughed at me.

Got my tray, and the second I touched it --- soda slips right into/all over my burger... I look at the cashier, and she smiles and shrugs...

Thanks a lot for nothing... WTF did I just spend $30 on? Same meal is $18 at McDonald's and they care about their customers!

Last time... I wish I had asked for the manager... I'm still shaking --- I'm so mad!"}
{"text":"A&W has come a long way in the last few years, not only with their marketing but their menu seems to back it all up.  So gone are the days of the car-hop who brought your meal on a tray and hung it on your open window, and for a while in the 80's i thought these guys were all but finished, but they seemed to have gone back to grass roots basics and bounced back just fine by introducing rather clever combinations and names we can all relate to, as well as marketing the purity of their products.  So i usually prefer the smaller organizations but there is no root beer like an A&W root beer in a frosty mug so this was my spot for the night.  The retro feel is ok but what i was most impressed with is the food they give you actually looks like the picture.  Cant say that about certain places, especially the one that sounds like Booger Thing.  A&W has won me over as far as the chain store burger joints are concerned.  I had a double teen burger, fries and gravy with a big ol' frosty mug of root beer and just a side note i love rhe real glass, not a paper cup and the funky french fry basket was cool too.  As for presentation, no other chain can touch these guys.  Everything was fresh and hot, and no complaints.  I'm absolutely coming back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I had a REALLY enjoyable fast food experience here at this A&W. I ordered sweet potato fries which are very well toasted/fried. I ordered the mozza beef burger - their tender & juicy beef reminded me of Shake Shack, the lettuce layer's fresh & crispy, the buns are brittle on the outside, soft and squeezable inside. Server is amiable, food is cooked &delivered quickly, and very clean & comfy ambience. So much better than those McDonald's & wendy's on Younge st. Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok depends on what you order and personal preference. Their prices are on the high side. Only good thing is location and late hours. if you dont wanna have macdonalds or bk you can try a&w"}
{"text":"It's been ages since we've dined at A&W, but we were in the area and decided to give it a shot.  

The burgers \"looked\" great but were dry.  Really dry :(

The only saving grace were the fries which were crispy. The onion rings were okay.

Nice presentation, but we personally prefer Wendy's."}
{"text":"First time at this location and most likely a last for me. It literally took 30 minutes for 3 burgers and a fries. Makes no sense unless you're doing it blind folded."}
{"text":"This A & W gets more than the usual 3 stars because this restaurant is the best bang for the buck in all of Terminal 1 as far as breakfast goes.  

When I fly out of the D gates at T1 I'm always going to have breakfast.  Sure there's a lot of options at Pearson like Tim Horton's or any other sandwich stand or a full sit down place but if you just want breakfast and I\"m talking about a real breakfast that is also sit down with a real plate, non plastic cutlery and coffee and juice that won't be more than 10 or 15 bucks this is the place.

They've just changed their menus and added an \"All Canadian\" breakfast which includes 2 eggs over easy, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links, 2 slices of tomato, 2 slices of toast for 7 bucks before tax, drinks extra Good deal right?  I'd say so. 

You can pay at one of the machines before you actually get to the pick up spot but I never do as it's never that busy in the morning it seems.  The turn around is fast and while the seating is very tight and half the seating is high bar or benches it's not that bad.

This is by far the best place to grab a real Ron Swanson approved breakfast in T1 for under 10 bucks..."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy. But it's a pure American classic. Big cold mugs of A&W Root Beer and chili cheese coney dogs. I love this place!!! Whenever it opens I know summer is close behind. It's close to Kent State campus and super cheap. Cute little car hops and menus small and similar. Even outside seating if you wanna get out of your car and get some sun.$ out of $$$"}
{"text":"I tried A&W for the first time 2 days ago. I must say the veggie burger isn't comparable to the one at Harvey's. Just the taste was totally different, but it wasn't all that bad. Asides from that I ordered a combo with my sandwich, fries and root beer. First of all the root beer I got was warm as if the cooler was turned off. I had to go home and add more ice for the drink, so it was cold enough for me. Fries were perfect, not a lot of salt. And the drive thru speaker has issues, I wasn't able to hear what the other person was saying most of the time. I just guessed that he was asking if I wanted a combo. Maybe I can try something else on the menu and actually WALK in."}
{"text":"Big NO for me, I was the only one ordering and I waited for about 10 minutes for a breakfast sandwich and 3 piece chicken. The young black gentlemen had not washed his hand prior to handling my sandwich. I asked him if he at least had gloves and he replied no. I was observing from a distance while he was making my food and noticed him spraying a kitchen cleanomg chemical on the surface of the egg fryer and then went on to crack the eggs on it. It was definitely not oil. 

Last but very not least, he had this offensive hip hop music playing on a speaker attached to his phone and would go back and forth changing the music. The music included graphic words and swearing. I got headache.

My food came out burnt when it was ready, to be honest. I didnt even say anything just waited till I was out of the store and threw it out. Just the basic sanitary level of my food was way past my tolerance line when he didnt have glove and just rinsed his hands with water when I asked to wash them
Thank you shitty food chain for taking my money anf offering just about the worst service available. Ive seen your commercials lately very appealing. I actually liked A&W, but now forget about it. I WILL go the extra lenhht to avoid this crappy disgussing food chain with low health safety standards"}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise! Plenty of seating area, friendly staff, fresh burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"There is something almost poetic about frothy A&W Rootbeer in a frosted mug.  The burger family here isn't to shoody either.  I love this location, because they never balk when I ask for extra pickles on the side.  I can't say the same for all A&W's."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer*
I try not review places in which time has passed since I had been there but it's unlikely I will be here again not because it was that bad but because im  not in the area alot. So with that take my review with cation

So I stopped in at A&W because I was hunger after a night at studying at Northern District, this was close and they do have good food,  not like a gourment burger place but one of better burger chain, Harvey I might be only one I rate better, maybe Wendy

Anyway so It was about  6pm and I was hungry and this was close, cheap good food. There wasnt anything really note worthly to discount the location ton have issue  They were quick with service and my order wasnt wrong, tasted good,

Only thing is that they do have a leaking ceiling that leave one corner unusable in seating area which isnt big, so it cant handle crowds but other then its fine

Its a location that has self serve machine so that is a plus"}
{"text":"I'm American and we don't have the credit card chip. That's no big deal but apparently the worker was very frustrated by me and my lack of knowledge. I was kind of annoyed. There wasn't a rush or anyone behind us in the drive thru either. Food was fine though."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food burger joints, this A&W location offers a great experience. While your meal could end up costing more than if you were to eat at McD's or BK, the quality you'll get here is definitely on another level. Staff is friendly and food is fresh. Worth a visit if you want good quality fast food."}
{"text":"This location absolutely sucks!! 

1) SUPER RUDE staff - they clearly do not care about their job, their customers or the brand. I am astonished how rude they can be. 

2) Came here at 945pm on a Friday when they are scheduled to close at 11pm and they said they are \"cleaning the kitchen and can only offer chicken products\" LOL 

Ownership should be embarrassed and frankly fire this lazy staff."}
{"text":"I had never been to this one before so thought I would pop in and try it. When I first pulled in, it almost appeared as if if was a shared space with Starbucks, you know, like one restaurant space divided in half .... When I walked in though it wasnt.  The layout and design of this A&W is what makes it so nice- spacious with a nice curving wall of booths and little nooks and crannys for booths and tables. The restaurant was quite busy but the service at the counter was fast and as always at most A&W's friendly. 
I had the veggie swiss burger and the onion rings...ahh those onion rings, big crispy and greasy....and always a root beer. A&W rootbeer is the best and no visit is complete without one. 
I like this location, I will go back again when in the area. 

I do miss the A&W root bear though!!!"}
{"text":"I always thought that A&W was Canadian, but in actual fact it has its origin in California where it first made its root beer1919!!!  The franchises began in 1921 where they sold root beer, floats and hot dogs. 
I was surprised to discover ( when researching them for this review) that they are in numerous countries all over the world including places like Bangladesh! Who would have thought that? 
 Ok enough of the history lesson. 
This A&W is like all of them, themed in the famous orange and brown colors with pics of drive ins, vintage cars, black and white snapshots and a general 1950's ish feel. 

This A&W is located near 17th ave, and subsequently gets it share of colorful characters, but the staff are excellent. Fast and efficient ( not necessarily friendly).  
When I was here, they were fast with their  service and my food was good. I had a veggie swiss burger ( a nice option) with onion rings and a root beer.  The onion rings here are hands down my favorite. They almost appear home made with whole onion rings not mashed onion inside. They are large and dusted with seasoning salt. SO good. The bag they are in always end up a greasy mess, but I have to say they are delicious! 

 The root beer is in my opinion THE BEST root beer on the planet. When I was living overseas I found a store that sold it and I just about cried with joy when I found it!!! When I was a kid I used to go to A&W with my mom, and the 2 of us would sit in the car and enjoy our mama burgers... mom is gone now, but I still cherish that memory. 
Anyhow.... I digress. 
This A&W is like most I have been to. Fast service, quality product and a nostalgic place to have a burger."}
{"text":"Rapide & bon! J'adore m'arrêter là après avoir fait une ride de vélo en partant de Laval. Ça permet de bien désaltérer. Il y a toujours des promotions donc on peut manger économiquement avec une bonne portion!"}
{"text":"I like this location. The staff is friendly and the burgers are delicious. Don't know if it's placebo effect but the root beer they got me from the drink machine tastes better that their bottled one (yes I refrigerate the bottle) However if you come during lunch hour you may not be able to find a seat. The patio is not the biggest either.

During my time there I found that most customers were the younger crowd. Nothing good or bad - I just find it interesting. 

Sometimes staff give out coupons outside the store to pedestrians. I prefer them over the online ones as they are a better deal. However you can only use them at this location or the 35 Eglinton Ave one."}
{"text":"Maybe it's nostalgia, but for some reason every time I have a Teen Burger I'm transported back to a time when hamburgers from a fast food restaurant was something to be excited about - a treat! Okay, I'm not that old, but my parents rarely let us eat junk food when I was growing up, and pretty much all the A & W's disappeared by the early 90's. Of those that did remain, several only served Chubby Chicken, which was always a major WTF moment once you read the menu. I digress, back to the review...to me a Teen Burger is the ultimate pick-me-up when you crave something terrible for you. The other burgers are good too, but this is my favorite. The sides are kind of boring, so I'd give them a miss. This location has always done me a solid on my Teen Burger, and I thank them."}
{"text":"It's junk food - so it was fast, warm, tasty but not brilliant. I went back once again but afterwards decided that there are lots of better alternatives around, so really, there is no reason to come here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Not a bad location; the ladies working were are friendly; i saw one of them bring food to a couple's table with a smile; my mama burger tasted really good and fries were nicely cut and not overly greasy

Wanna try their breakfast menu next time."}
{"text":"Despite the slight lack of variety on their menu, I usually like A&W. They have delicious burgers, fries and onion rings. 

This location is no exception. It is a really welcoming addition to Sheppard Centre. Service has always been fast and friendly for me. Also, they serve all day breakfast sandwiches here.

They have free wifi and you don't have to make a purchase to use it in the food court. Enjoy but don't misuse it :)"}
{"text":"What's a trip to Canada without poutine? Back in the states I have seen many gourmet poutine creations inspired by Canada's beloved poutine. In it's basic form it composes of fries topped with cheese curd and gravy. To my surprise, poutine can be found EVERYWHERE in Canada... basically any restaurant that has french fries whether it is a fast food chain or a mom and pop shop. 

While shopping at Vaughan Mills I knew I wanted to stop by their food court for some poutine before I flew back to the states. I decided to go to A&W since the A&Ws back home have closed down so I thought I would enjoy a nice Root Beer Float ($3.50 CAD) with my Poutine Fries ($4.50 CAD). 

It was surprising that there was a long line waiting for A&W on a Monday morning and it was an even longer wait for such a simple order. There was a lot of workers behind the counter but I felt like they could have been more efficient. 

At long last I got my Poutine Fries!! It was really... salty... The gravy was incredibly salty and I think the best thing about this item was the cheese. The fries were on the soft side and it quickly became soggy under the gravy. I think this would have been more enjoyable if the fries were nice and crispy. On the other hand I really enjoyed my Root Beer Float. I happened to be in Toronto during the record breaking heat all year long so this was a nice cool treat. The Root Beer here was less sweet and less carbonated than the A&W back in the states so I really enjoyed it with the vanilla ice cream. 

Just as the Chopped judges were saying on Canadian Food Network channel, I felt like A&W was \"pedestrian\" but I guess that is to be expected for a fast food restaurant. Except... they were not fast at all..."}
{"text":"I'm really not a fast food type of person, but occassionally I like to get a big breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon, toast, hash brown and a coffee.  I could go to Cora's and pay $9 plus tip, but I find that's kind of ridiculous for stuff that EVEN I COULD MAKE. However, I really do like A&W's breakfast.  It's 5.99 or 6.99 for all of that (I don't remember the exact price) and they even have coupons sometimes, so you can do a buy 1, get 1 free or get 1 half off.  

To me, that's how much a bacon and eggs breakfast should cost you, 5.99 or 6.99.  Very reasonable.  They also cook it on the spot and are fairly quick with it. Maybe 3-4 minutes and will bring it to your table if they aren't busy.  And their hasbrown and fries come in the cutest little container that is like a mini deep fryer.  SO AWESOME!

Verdict: Great for a quick breakfast, espeically if you are shopping at the T&T next door."}
{"text":"Thus far, I have had inconsistent experiences with this particular A&W. My first visit was unremarkable, and I mean this as a relatively positive thing. It was exactly as I expected, the food tasted like A&W food should and the service was reasonably polite and quick. 

My visit for breakfast this morning was also satisfactory. The egg on my English muffin tasted very fresh and looked much more natural than the round or square pucks i'v had at other places. The hash brown was a little oily, but not too salty, and the coffee was *ok* (but not great).

My interim visit to this location was quite different. The service, although polite and friendly, seemed slower than it should have been. The counter person seemed a little stressed, and they seemed to to be having some trouble communicating in the prep area and pushing out the orders. I also noticed that their pep person did not wear gloves while assembling the order. We also realized once we where 2 blocks away, that the plain burger we ordered was slathered in condiments, despite the prep person being specifically told twice that the burger was to be plain (just the meat and the bun). We turned back to have it replaced. That being said, despite the initial trouble, they apologized, replaced the burger and told my daughter they would give her a free meal next time (although it was a verbal promise... No voucher or anything...)"}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero stars if possible for not having proper quality control and horrible customer service. Went to this location with my girlfriend, ordered a mama burger. Employees were too busy chit chatting, didn't bother to see they burnt the bun. Meat was tasteless as well, one word disgusting. Made her feel nauseous after.

I felt bad because I suggested this place to her, made up for it by making her a homemade burger with all her favourite toppings... no tomatoes though. :("}
{"text":"Headline: Umm....it's A&W but they have the cutest basket to put their fries and hash browns in.  

Came here for breakfast the other day before heading out for the day and had eggs, bacon, hash brown, toast and coffee for under $7.  That's a decent deal in my books.  Eggs are cracked fresh and the hash browns come in the coolest little basket - love it. Don't know why, but I do lol.

What I like - cheap breakfast, they bring it to your table and coffee has improved from before.
Dislike: umm..the parking lot is too far from the main entrance.

Verdict - good quickie breakie."}
{"text":"This location is an over all of 3.5 stars, it loses points due to the drop in quality of their product. For example my teen burger during the day has been a fresh burger on fresh buns, with all the toppings fresh. In the night my food has either been falling apart or void of any toppings at all, however the drop in quality doesn't come with a drop in price. If you really want to try this place go during the day, because a night time visit will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Literally not figuratively.However if you are reading this after having a bad night time experience, all hope is not lost. You can send a complaint on the website and they will remedy your problem. On the upside of this location is the chilled drinking glasses which are a delight at any hour."}
{"text":"Chubby Chicken indeed. Nothing like throwing away all your allowed calorie intake like a trip to A&W and eating their teen burgers while waiting for the bucket of Chubby Chicken you're bringing to a party you're going to be EATING at.

This location is busy, but runs efficiently. I got my order in less than 15 minutes, despite being very demanding. 15 pieces of DARK MEAT chicken? Always for my family clan. 

The food was ok, it's A&W not Charcut.

The girl behind the counter was quite peppy and eager to help. She must be new and hasn't felt the slow drowning feeling working at a fast food joint has. Bless her sweet heart, it won't be innocent for long.

Also their tills are OLD AS FUuuu. When I worked fast food, we had digital touch screens, and this was over 10 years ago. These tills look like they were the prototype for science calculators.

{"text":"Oh, well it's an A&W... Do they have those where your from? If they do, why are you looking up a good A & W on Yelp? You know what you're getting yourself into. Go if you want, but know there are plenty of better option around town. Check out my best burgers list here: 

IF NOT READ: It's a fast food burger chain much like the infamous McDonalds, except with a hint of 50's drive through nostalgia, promoting the classic 50's family unite with their burger family, and for some reason a bear with a tuba theme song (ba-dum, ba-dum....) is involved.

What do you get? A McDonalds burger with some tasty upgrades. Some charcoal, flame grilled flavour paired along with a tonne of sodium.

Grab yourself a Teen Burger, an onion rings and a root beer for the classic American Ay En Dub experience. Is it good? Well personally, I think it's a cuter, stuck in the drive-thru era version of McDonalds, selling the same stuff they always have, except now try to use the power of marketing, madmen-style, to make me think that they use farmers market beef, and better ingredients because they serve their burgers in half open paper bags. I'm not buying it. You're the epitome of mass produced american fast food, A & W, but you're still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Totally a dive fast food restaurant BUT they have a great veggie burger called a \"veggie deluxe.\" It's not vegan but it's very tasty. Good enough to make me go in here ever time I'm in Calgary. It also doesn't hurt that to get there from the Calgary Marriott (where I usually stay) and the Calgary Tower, you go outside for about 100 meters.

For a cheap, good veggie burger, I'd suggest any A&W. Oh, and try the onion rings too."}
{"text":"Another blast from the past, I haven't had A&W since I was a kid and its still the same great fast food from before. They're fast, tastes great.

Teen burger + poutine and the poutine does not disappoint. Is it the best ever? No, but in the fast food world it is more than sufficient. Hearty amount of gravy, good amount of cheese curds and crisp fries. Teen burger is your normal well made bacon cheeseburger. And all that washed down with A&W root beer. I don't even like root beer, but it only feels right drinking it here.

You'll have the food coma after just warning you..."}
{"text":"I got a cheddar bacon burger, root beer, and poutine. The burger was great, perfectly seasoned, and the root beer tasted better than the A&W you can get in the US, whether bottled or fountain (creamier and less acidity). However, the poutine was terrible: melted cheese with no texture, and a gravy that tasted like the seasoning in chicken-flavored cup noodles."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for a quick visit, we usually just go through the drive thru but I'm glad we stopped in. All the workers were extremely friendly, our food was delicious (as always with A&W). Exceptional experience all around!"}
{"text":"A&W are super rare to find in California. So coming here was a great! Food was so good! I could've ate seconds! I love that the drinks are in jugs! So awesome!! We ate double cheeseburgers with fries and onion rings! All the food tasted fresh and delicious!! I'm craving it now!!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are awesome, however the manager ( Kevin) was extremely rude. He actually yelled at my wife from the kitchen.  When I asked him about not yelling at my wife, he denied it. As I turned to walk away, he started jumping up and down making monkey motions and just being weird.   

If you're looking for average food and want to be disrespected then this place is for you!

NEVER RETURNING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worse A&W I've had. Everything tasted as though it'd been sitting for hours. Burger patties barely warm, onions rings were about the same and portions small. Added a hash brown for my little one for lunch and it must had been from the morning, dry, and chewy."}
{"text":"Great location, nice setting, but the management sucks big time! Completely jammed, no staff to clean and waiting for the order for over 20mins!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now and they have been unable to get my order right even one of those times. It's really unfortunate because I was excited that A&W was coming to my neighbourhood, and  I really couldn't be more clear in what I'm ordering... I've expressly described each topping that I want each time and they still somehow manage to get it wrong!! 

I'm at a loss. But it's so annoying to get all the way home and see the order made wrong time after time..."}
{"text":"This is one of those guilty pleasure places for me.  My ex gf and I went here all the time.

A&Ws seem really big here in Southern Ontario.  In Los Angeles you hardly ever see them.  So, they are kind of fun, curiosity to me.

Yeah, it is corporate owned fast food: you know what you are in for, bad and good.  When I want gourmet, I know where to go.  When I want cheap, easy and reliable, I will go to a place like this.  (I have my limits though--this and Harvey's are the only fastfood chains I eat at).

I love the frosty mug of rootbeer and free refill.
The poutine is tasty.  Instant gravy but vege friendly.
The sweet potato fries are fine.
I've tried several of the sandwiches.  Again, nothing incredibly amazing but always very tasty.

The service has always been friendly and our orders were always right.  

I might not go to less location due to personal associations but I'll go to others.  Recommended in the category of fast food hamburger."}
{"text":"Been here many, many times throughout my university years at McGill. Most times the services are friendly, especially at night when it's not busy the workers seem super chill and they make small friendly conversations. Food was always good, better than all the other A&Ws in Montreal. Only bad experience is that one time the cashier seemed awfully inconvenienced by the fact that we wanted to replace one item with something else and obviously showed it. Never saw him again so all good :^)"}
{"text":"Love this place and it's my favourite fast food burger. Always is fresh with the one in alpha too, rings are delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was good service was horrible.  What is it with businesses these days???  How hard is it to smile and say hi to customers.  I walked up to the counter and the girl was just looking at me with a mean looking face.  She said nothing to me, but when she saw me taking a photo of their email from a poster behind cash she said thank you, but only because I was taking the photo.  Too bad as A & W when it comes to burgers is my fav, but won't go back due to the horrible service."}
{"text":"Pretty standard A & W. This is the only A & W close to work. Quality is always consistent and the restaurant is clean. Good and fast service. I always recommend their beef burgers. But the chicken burger they are advertising much about nowadays is a little too disappointing in my opinion. It doesn't taste any different than the McChicken. Both are very salty.



Review 8 of 100"}
{"text":"My Wife has troubles with breakfast. She can't eat eggs and is a bit fussy. She loves her burgers and well...FINALLY a burger in the morning!!!!"}
{"text":"Great drunk food, but man don't you feel terrible when you realize what you've done to yourself.  Sometimes I sit and weep realizing all the delicious damage I've done to my body by eating A&W.  But then I take another bite of that delicious \"Little Buddy Burger\", and dry my tears on that soft roll.  

A&W is somewhere between having a religious experience and at the same time going to a clinic to participate in a heart disease study.  It rocks your world, but then you realize later that the long term ramifications of indulging in such a delectable, greasy, *beef* (AKA horse meat) burger is that you may very well be shortening you life.  

That's what makes this food so good.  You know it's killing you, but it's killing you softly with it's sweet siren song, and so it lulls you into a deep sleep after a long night of drinking."}
{"text":"Hubby and I come here from time to time when we're in the mood for a fast food breakfast. We appreciate the idea that A & W uses eggs from hens fed using no animal byproducts, beef raised without steroids or hormones, and pork and chicken raised without the use of antibiotics. 

When ordering the classic breakfast, we ask for whole wheat bread and request that they not pre-butter the toast. 

My hubby usually goes online to access coupons from the A & W website.

The restaurant is located in the Petro Canada gas station. This particular location has a patio and is open 24 hours.

(52/100)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick breakfast and had the most enjoyable experience!

Both of the staff members we interacted with were remarkably hospitable, kind, and even funny.

The food was a solid breakfast platter for a very reasonable price. Far better than I anticipated from a fast-food location. Every single item was done exactly right.

The atmosphere was idyllic and carefree. The interior was well-lit and clean, augmented with happy soft rock playing.

Overall, a surprisingly applaudable experience.

10/10, would nom again!"}
{"text":"Every time I get the A & W coupons in the mail I make a trip for breakfast. I haven't tried their burgers in a while but when you can get toast, eggs, and bacon for less then $10 and it is fast then you can not go wrong. I tend to order two breakfasts each time and leave feeling ready to take on the day. The sad thing is some locations don't have hot chocolate, which seems strange. The coffee is just nasty without hot chocolate so depending on what location you go to you may want to just get water."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the drive-through order, as it was what we did on that evening.

The good: They were correct in the order we asked for.

The bad: We waited a good 5 to 10 minutes... before giving our order at the drive-through. Then we waited almost 30 minutes before receiving ONE burger, ONE fries and ONE Root Beer.

It showed that the clerk seemed overwhelmed by his work. Sadly, the customer pays by waiting forever."}
{"text":"place is awesome. my parents and I went here in 2002.  wish we had one in Hawaii."}
{"text":"This is a nice warm and cozy place to stop by especially on those mornings when you've just dropped off your son at school and skipped breakfast.  The staff are pleasant, helpful, and efficient. Quite a lot of regulars come here in the mornings and liven up the atmosphere.  This A & W is open 24 hrs and it's also great to know that their beef burgers contain no hormones or steroids.  They also accept SUTP coupons for Bacon 'n Eggers, Sausage 'n Eggers, and Mozza Burgers.
The Wifi is free but not very strong.  The parking lot may be difficult to access from 4th St (heading north) during rush hour."}
{"text":"Since I was on my way home and had expiring coupons to use up, I stopped by for a Chubby Chicken burger, fries and A&W root beer for $5.99.  The burger was okay--the chicken was adequately seasoned but the mayo (semi-translucent colour) looked like it had been sitting out on the kitchen counter for a while. My fries were a bit soggy but the root beer was wonderfully refreshing (A&W prides itself in not adding ice to their drinks).  
On a previous occasion, I tried to order a teen burger and fries through the drive-thru at 8:45pm but was told that I could only order cold items (the staff had already turned off the grill).

I still prefer going to the A & W on 4 St. and 16th Ave. N.W.   The root beer is served ice cold and frothy in a glass mug(if you're eating in), the hot chocolate is creamy and piping hot, the service is always quick and efficient, and they're open 24/7 (drive-thru only after 10pm)."}
{"text":"The staff was helpful, the guac burgers were okay, nothing amazing about it, but still worth the money because of the staff, thank you all, not your fault for the ingredients, superb environment, thanks"}
{"text":"We have visited this place numerous times, but today  09 June 2018, the burger was hot, fresh and delicious.   Most other times the burgers were sitting and staying warm and getting hard.  We arrived at 13:21 and the burgers were great.  I ordered the Double Buddy burger with cheese and my husband ordered two Buddy burgers.   I know, I know, I know, but I still get annoyed when they ask \"You want a combo?\"   Trained seals and I can't blame them, it is the corporation that requires them to ask.  However it does get annoying.  So actually I'm going to take a star away.  Only three because of the annoyance of \"You want a combo\"."}
{"text":"About the same as most of these chains, breakfast is decently cheap with eggcellent ingredients. 
This time in for a teen burger combo which came to 10.68$ in my opinion is a lot for any fast food combo but tastes amaaaazing still so I will keep saying that A&W is expensive plus I disapprove of the choice of music (it was set to a more \"vintage\" genre) and don't get me started on why on earth they felt the urge to paint lime green over a wall picture of an A&W back in the golden days. 
 But this establishment is a good choice for a good fill."}
{"text":"Dirty and mismanaged. I tried to order at the counter and after repeating my order 3 times, had to ask the manager to stop interrupting the cashier so she could place the order. The manager was bellowing across the restaurant like a fish wife.  I called A&W corporate to let them know, they didn't care at all.  Haven't been back. It's a crap brand."}
{"text":"Footlong whose got the Footlong. A&W is a classic, nothing special about it. You have to get a dirty water footlong hotdog with coney sauce and some cheese curds. Love those deep fried curds. Of course finish the meal with a big mug of root beer."}
{"text":"I really like this A&W's, the burgers are consistently good here. The staff are friendly (one girl was a little umm...uneducated but that's fine). Most are polite and go above and beyond to help the customer. 
They allowed us to have refills on our root beer, gave us some a&w seasoning to go, the food was presented well and it was delicious.

My boyfriend always wants to go here. He is obsessed with their seasoning, sweet potato fries, and poppa burgers.

I enjoy going here as well. He's new to A&W's (first time was this year), so he's obsessed with it and especially this one as the food is consistently good and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Oh dear.
Where do I begin.
The fact that we paid for sweet potato fries, then our server April printed out another receipt (not ours) and accused me of lying.
She remembered me asking for them so she kindly snatched our regular fries out of my hands and exasperatedly chucked them into the bin with the flair of a figure skater.
I then waited five minutes for what we had ordered and paid for.
She handed me the fries but not the spicy mayo.
I asked for it and she distractedly handed it to me.
Being tight on time, my boyfriend and I headed back to the car and were munching on the fries on the way back to work.
They were SOGGY.
So gross. The worst sweet potato fries I've had from A & W's.
Ever.
She gave us the wrong burger which I realized much later (didn't have time to switch it, didn't really care, it was still good).
If you're in Vaughan Mills and NEED an A & W's fix, stick to the burgs and not the fries.
Make sure you check your order, she messed up on the one before me and after me.
...Just so distracted!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the newer locations in calgary, and is quite modern inside. The dining area is relatively large, and there is a patio for outside dining. Overall, the resturaunt is quite clean and has a nice clean, open atmosphere. Of course the food is good aswell, personally i would recommend the teen burger. Also, a good idea would be to bring any coupons that may have been mailed to you, as you can usually get some good two can dine deals!"}
{"text":"So, I've been going to this a&w pretty regularly for approximately five years. Let's say I probably ate there once a month. Well, never again. 

I always order the same thing: a Papa Burger with cheese. I passed the order and was served an Uncle Burger. For those of you who don't know, an Uncle Burger comes with bacon. I hate bacon! I don't eat bacon. Why would I have ordered something with bacon on it? 

I acknowledge the fact that I might have made an error while ordering my meal. I mean, I strongly doubt it, but it's a possibility. So when I approached the cashier and explained her the situation, she rolled her eyes at me, slapped her hand on the counter, told me I was wrong, then asked her manager what to do. Alright. I might add I was being polite here and I wasn't blaming her for being served the wrong burger! I've worked in food and beverage! Things can happen! 

Now the manager was just as bad as she was. He offered not to switch the burger, but to simply pick off the bacon. 

Get your grubby hands off my burger which I paid $12 for, thank you! Good God. Are you kidding me? \"Let me take it off for you.\" I can take off my own bacon! I'm a grown man! God help me if I step foot in this place again. If the same situation had occurred at McDonald's or Starbucks the product would have been switched no questions asked."}
{"text":"Rating: 1.5

Decided to get some breakfast from A&W's. Generally I don't like to come here because I have always thought their food is very dry and gross, but it was like 9:30 in the morning and it was one of the only places opened so I didn't really have a choice. I got the classic bacon and eggs. To be honest, it was meh. The toast was more on the burnt side rather than a nice golden-brown. The bacon was not crispy and very dry. THe only good thing were the eggs. lol."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of A&W's buddy burger however, my visit today was a little on the underwhelming side. I tried the Poutine which tasted very similar to KFC's poutine, the portion was very small and came in a tiny box with a small drink the total came to $7.19 - not worth it in my opinion. The fries were good, the gravy was tasty (very similar to KFC's gravy) and there were chunks of cheese. Overall it was just OKAY,  the price of it all together with the size of the poutine made it underwhelming. 

I will return but I probably will pass on the poutine."}
{"text":"Mold on burger!!!! Euk! Be careful! 
Check your meal BEFORE to eat it! 
Not very clean inside. 
They give money back if your burger is GREEN. Ok. 
Never see me again! 

Pain à Burger PÉRIMÉS!!!! Moisissure sur mon Burger... Faites attention! Vérifiez AVANT de manger..
Hygiène et propreté NULLES! 
Pour estomacs avertis seulement. 
Ils vous remboursent sans soucis... Évidemment. 
Service ok."}
{"text":"This is the worst A&W I've ever been to. 

Burgers are always cold, never fresh, condiments are put on with way too heavy a hand, the chicken is bland and chewy, such a shame, a good A&W would have been great for this area.

Avoid."}
{"text":"Their fast and friendly, burgers are good, chubby chicken buddy's are the best and their open 24 hours."}
{"text":"The signature burger here is the Teen burger, and it's delicious. The Chubby Chicken sandwich is one of the better chicken sandwiches you'll find as well. The onion rings are amazing. Interesting note on the drinks, root beer is THE drink and it comes without ice so as not to dilute it. Nice!"}
{"text":"Typical fast food burger joint! Great thing about this is that it is open 24/7! So if you are sick of mcdonalds make your way to a&w
You gotta get the root beer!"}
{"text":"A&w is great but they need tjere deals on teen burgers back at under 9$ a trio

I over love the papa or teen burgers with cheese.

24/7 all the time in Brampton"}
{"text":"A&W at its best today , tried mozza burger and double buddy with spiced up fries , great  n helpful staff and offcourse burger were juicy too .
Thanks A&W !"}
{"text":"This location was not originally listed so image my surprise when I came here to yelp it!

The staff are fantastic, this place is never busy! 
I work nearby so I come here once in a while for lunch.
They are in the same plaza as Home Depot and you have to enter that parking lot to access the restaurant.

I received my coupon for a free sriracha burger so off I went for lunch! 
I had also received a coupon for a free drink a while back so I was able to get my meal free!

The burger was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of spice, so when I heard about sriracha I assumed it would be hot... Wrong! 
This burger is so tame, perfect for me!

A+ location, staff and yummy burgers!"}
{"text":"Hey, the skinny night shift guy around 11:06pm on May 30, you are pathetic! I was in desperate need of using toilet so I parked and entered your joint. You stopped me saying you are closed. I respected what you said and left, winding up with the search result later in Yelp that you are 24/7. You will be rewarded guarding your pee-poo altar right? Be human and live happy with more consciousness!"}
{"text":"Great experience! 
Delicious burgers & onion rings!! mmmm
I love (and hope it's true) that their animals are fed well - with no antibiotics, or pumped with steroids. 
Staff was extremely friendly bringing us our trays of food. And it was a cute experience dining in, with their big A&W glass mugs of root beer and other soft drinks."}
{"text":"I always order the mozzarella burger combo with mayo instead of their sauce at the Yonge & Eglinton food court, which is always fresh and delicious! I went here because I had a coupon and ordered the same thing but it was a bit tasteless and disappointing.  The place is a bit small, the cashiers speak rudely (could be misinterpreted because of their accents) and the only reason it's decent is because the store is one of the newer concept A & W restaurants where they serve your fries in a cute stainless steel basket with paper to collect any oil, the tables have seasoning salt to dress up your fries and if you have your food to dine-in, they serve your drink with a frosty glass. I wouldn't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Frustrating location. Either they are closed when they should be open 24hrs or their machine is down and they are only taking cash without access to the ATM on site as only the drive through is open.
I have never been more annoyed with a fast food chain. Food is mediocre, service providers are disassociate and uninterested in carrying out their job (But I feel this isn't fair... as I have had a few that were truly exceptional... just a few bad apples spoiling it for the rest). 
It's an all out disaster unfortunately which is a pity as I generally like A&W, but something is wrong here."}
{"text":"I like coming here for breakfast because it is close to home and quick to order. A&W serves a classic breakfast with eggs, bacon and toast until 11AM. After I had ordered the same breakfast several times over the course of a few days the girl in the kitchen instructed the cashier to enter my usual into the register. I find the staff to be friendly, the food fast. I like the way they package the classic breakfast because I can easily fit it into my backpack and eat in on the train while standing with my bike."}
{"text":"All I wanted from the drive through was some soggy yam fries and a veggie burger. They were out of veggie burgers. I had to sit in the line anyway because I was blocked in the line by then. It's not good to garner a bad review before the customer has even eating the food."}
{"text":"never really heard of this fast food chain before coming to montreal. I have seen the root beer before but thats about it. Speaking of root beer I love how they chill the mugs for when anyone orders the drink. The root beer is a little sweet and syrup-ey for my liking.

The burgers taste pretty good. This is great late night drunk food. We had the mama burger and the chicken sandwich. 

The curly fries are simple and taste like you would expect. Nothing spectacular.

Overall, this is a solid 3 star fast food place. I would however prefer mcdonalds or wendys to this."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick, basic meal to take back to my apartment in the Entertainment District. A&W fit the bill. Had a double teen burger and a root beer float. Both were good."}
{"text":"I've been a huge A&W fan since I've been a small child... and thus my long love with root beer started at a tender age. What I truly enjoy about this place is of course... the root beer which served in a huge frozen mug that makes the experience pretty unique in most fast food establishments.

I recently ordered a Mozza burger trio. I personally enjoy the burger and it is pretty tasty for fast food, I already mentioned the root beer but what I really dislike is how bad the onion rings taste at A&W the last few years. Onion rings, in general, make me pretty happy and I'm not picky at the variety but I'd be damned if I don't mention how bad they are at A&W (and the fact I always forget!).... what's up with the crappy batter and chunks of salt? The batter doesn't stick to your onion rings and the salt is beyond healthy. When I chew you onion and all I taste are hard bits of batter and excessive salt, something is wrong.

Fix it!

The fries that I ordered this time were solid.

But leave the burger and root beer along please. They gud!"}
{"text":"I normally like A&W.  But not this location.  I ordered a momma burger and rings. The momma burger tasted like a momma. An old mommas baloney pony.  Dry and stale.  The deep fry specialist needs to take a refresher course.  I watched you the whole time.  Sticking your fingers in the food and stuff a big no no.  Then when I got my rings they were not even cooked.  My entire bag of rings was one big clump.   Dude, don't serve crap you would not eat."}
{"text":"I like this location best. I am ANTI Mcdonald's by the way. I find the food at A&W tastes much better. Thank you to all staff at this location for always being courteous to me. Have a great day!"}
{"text":"Went here today and it took 15 minutes for my fries (?) and they don't have ice at this location so the root beer was gross and warm. Got lots of rude looks and scowls from the workers and the customer service was awful. Also I saw the guy making burgers using his BARE HANDS. No gloves on or anything. Definitely will not be back"}
{"text":"I mean, ok, two stars, seems a bit harsh, right? I'm not tryna be harsh tho, k? like, I've got MAD respect for the brave men and women working on the onion ring front lines day after day to bringing us late afternoon all day breakfast hangover food, so these two stars are not for you, burger assembling comrades. 

Now A&W, Yoooouuuu, you usually got what I need, but this most recent experience was sub par. Have you changed your hashbrown recipe? I felt like I was eating woodchips saturated in canola oil. The onion rings, usually these rings are my DAMN JAM, but they were so crumbly that I soiled my good linens, I could not even eat them, they just disintegrated into bits upon my 1,000 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets that were a gift from my late great-aunt Edna. She didn't die IN the sheets, so stop freaking asking ok!!!!!! She passed on the leather sofa in the TV room.

The Egg sandwich, well, this saved the day. niiiiice amount of cheese. Nice. yes yes, cheese says it's just a friend, oh baby CHEEESSSEE got what you neeeeeed."}
{"text":"it is an A&W and I realize this is not a healthy food choice but when we went in I noticed they actually have real glass A&W mugs with their logo on them in colour and that must have cost them a fortune so I felt a bit nostalgic

The thickest patty I've seen on a Teen Burger (was it hunger and jet lag or just Alberta beef?). Fresh bun and generous lettuce, tomato slices, bacon, pickles, cheese and condiments.

This is the guilty pleasure that makes me not mind a connection at Calgary Airport.  Forget Chili's, Jugo Juice and Subway . . .  Hit the A&W around the corner in the Food Court . . . ."}
{"text":"A&W lays out a decent breakfast. A bit early for Sunday opening at the mall? Get a decent breakfast of bacon, eggs (made to order... sunny side up, over easy, over hard, etc.), toast, and hashbrowns."}

{"text":"Classic junk food. It's pretty bad. If you want a real burger go up the street to Le Barbare."}
{"text":"It's not the food we were upset at but the fact that there was nowhere to sit. 

Warning...do not come here on a Sunday morning! 

As regulars for the last 10+ years we will be going elsewhere from now on. Our group that numbers 6 (today we were 8) often are waiting for a couple of tables to open up so we can sit together but OFTEN we observe lone patrons sitting at a table of 4 with a cup of coffee reading a paper. Times that scenario a few times and you have a 'full' restaurant of paper readers sipping coffee.

Now, to give the staff credit they do offer free coffee refills but...people who have orders their delicious breakfast are ether waiting or have already given up or not bothered to order at all. 

Here is a suggestion....don't put out papers on Sunday until AFTER the morning rush, like around 11am. If anyone brings one take it away if they leave it. Post a sign asking patrons to have a little compassion to families with hungry kids waiting to sit.   

Today, because of paper readers you lost 4 full breakfast orders out of 8. Next week you will be down 8 breakfasts."}
{"text":"My order was:
* Mamma burger combo with cheese, no onions no mayo.
*Teen burger, no onions, no mustard. 

I did not specify onion rings. 

How could you possibly screw that up? I spoke very clearly. 

There was MAYO & ONIONS on both burgers.....and yucky mustard. 

My son & I can't eat raw onions. 

Not only was I overcharged for the onion rings, I got the wrong order. We were in a time constraint for lunch and couldn't go back. How workers can think they are worth $15/hr for such slacking service is beyond me."}
{"text":"Food was Ofcourse as usual. A&w makes nice burgers with toasted buns which I love.

But holy smokes worst service from the worst cashier ever. Her name was Kaya. I had asked to be buzzed in for the washroom but I knew a child was in the second washroom. So she buzzed but I was trying to open the first one. Instead of kindly buzzing me in the first washroom or just taking me to wait, she screamed across the restaurant \"the second washroom!!\" 3 times. The people were all starting at me and the child was now scared cause his door kept clicking. She was so rude. I've never had such rude service in my life. No smile and she didn't even look up at me when I had asked her if I could use the washroom while we waited for our order. 

Unbelievable. Of and to top it all off, there was no toilet paper. A kinder staff named Cathy who seemed to be doing all the work and all the smiling gave me a roll. 

I work in the service industry. And there is just no excuse. She was plain rude. Didn't look at us, mumbled her words, yelled at me three times across the restaurant for the washroom and didn't listen when the mother said oh my son is in there. I have never ever ever given such a bad rating. Hope she doesn't treat everyone like this everyday."}
{"text":"LIving downtown, this is my 'local' A&W. Ive always had a soft spot for A&W, its retro feel restaurants and basic but well done fast food, and good coffee.

A&W can sometimes be a miss if the staff are below average. Now and again in other locations you may get an eye roll if you ask for coffee late at night, or a refusal to make any if they have none. Bonus: in rural locations the girl staff are usually local perky adorable farmers daughter types. Urban on a rare occasion you can get a few oddities but never terrible service. Im happy to see A&W still has smarter corporate clean cut standards for its staff appearance over the increasing cultural marxism freakshow that is Starbucks, which now lets its staff wear whatever they like (make up on men anyone?!?) and have whatever hair colour and metal/tattoos they feel like going. SMH. 

This one is brand new and replaced the Mexican restaurant and something else that was there next to it. I believe they knocked 2 units together. Agreed with some other reviewers, it's new so of course still very clean. We will see how long that lasts as alas the double edged sword of being downtown means also the poor staff have to cope with all the scrotes, tramps, druggies, drunks and weirdos frequenting the place.

Overall A&W has been my 'go to' fast food joint for years. Alas some of the old 50's retro charm as been deleted on many new ones and refits in a baffling obsession of change for change sake and this one feels more like an IKEA showroom than a cosier older model style of A&W. It's a little bright lighting wise here also. Nothing 'wrong' per se, just not as warm and homey feeling as the retro style they used to have. However, still better than the McDonalds 'Retards Fun House' refit style. Gone is the 40s, 50s, 60s rockabilly, Sinatra etc music and in with the same old top 40. Sigh. A&W doesn't do nostalgia anymore, but...the food is still competent. A sign of the times being downtown, they have to lock the toilets, which I find a teeth grinding irritation but understand why they have to do it. They must have patience of Saints to deal with all the freaks that come on off downtown wanting to use their loo as a personal washing facility.

Coffee still the best basic 'cuppa Joe' around, even if they did change it a few years ago from the perfectly fine decades old rocket fuel Allen&Wright blend, to a far more expensive organic blend. Completely unneeded but hey what can ya do. A large coffee is now over that psychological $2 barrier when one used to be able to get a large to go for about a buck 70. I also wish they would put the creamers in a chilled container or thermal jug at the condiment area instead of me constantly having to ask. Their prices appear to be quite higher at this location, I almost took a step back when I was asked $6.30 for ONE spicy chicken burger.

Still, free refills, so that's nice.(take that Phil & Sebastian) I can walk there with my New York Post and read my paper in relative peace and quiet from the 17th ave chaos outside, and leave just before the weekender party 'Great Unwash'd' stagger in. Haven't tried their real bacon and eggs brekkie at this location yet, but should be consistent, as franchise fast food is tough to screw up.

Oh and franchise manager? PLEASE please do NOT add a TV, (get rid of the current ones) and bring back the nostalgia music.

Good job so far Mr Franchise manager Sir."}

{"text":"At 11:38am on Friday January 19th at 650 Queen St. W. location:

I ordered from the counter, and noticed the cook was on her phone. I watched the cook put her phone in her back pocket and proceed to pick up a hashbrown with her bare hands, and put it in the fryer. I waved it off, thinking it was going to be cooked and kill all bacteria anyway... but then I watched her go straight to pick up a bag of english muffins to open it. At this point she hadn't washed her hands AT ALL. 

I called into the kitchen asking her to wash her hands, at which point she did. While I waited for my food, both employees were whispering while looking at me. I felt so unsure about my food being handled properly that I couldn't even eat it. I'm pregnant, so food safety is very important to me as it can affect not just me, but my unborn child. 

This was only my second visit to this A&W, despite the fact that I work nearby, and a lot of my colleagues eat here on a regular basis. 

The first visit it took 30 mins to make an egg and bacon breakfast when there was no one else in the restaurant. When I asked the staff what was taking so long (there were 5 of them), they stared at me blankly and said \"I don't know\". When I eventually got breakfast, it was the incorrect order. I asked again why, and was told \"I don't know\". I had such horrific service that I avoid eating there generally - but thought I'd give it another shot. 

Now, instead of having breakfast, I've spent my 30 min break reporting this violation to the food & safety administration, writing this review, and telling everyone I work with never to eat there again.  

I've been to other A&W locations all across Ontario and never had experiences like this before. This location is single-handedly killing the reputation of an otherwise great fast-food company."}
{"text":"there's a lovely lady who works here, who's served us I think every time we've been in. she's always really warm and polite. 

I love getting frosted root beers in the big mugs (not the same as getting it to take away so always drink in rather than to go!), and the maple chipotle burgers are insanely good. i'm not hugely fussed on the regular burgers (ie the Teen burger), but they're still nice. I think the maple chipotle burgers are a temporary menu item though (maybe I'm wrong? I hope I'm wrong). 

mcdonalds double quarter pounder with cheese is the best burger of all time, and the maple chipotle is a close second."}
{"text":"So this is Canada's burger, huh. I got the mama burger, pretty good, definitely better than McDonalds."}
{"text":"One of the best and most consistent A & W in Calgary. 

Very clean dining area, staff are super friendly, drive thru is efficient and the food is delicious. 

Selection and pricing of A & W are little higher but the taste is well worth it. 

The frosty mugs with Root Beer is a must have along with crispy seasoned Onion Rings!

Fast food at its best on 130th in SE Calgary. 

Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Only fast food in Auburn Bay. 

Clean and new restaurant. 

Staff are friendly and pricing on the higher end. Combos cost you $7-9 a person. 

Portions and food are consistently hot and fresh. 

It's open 24 hours and no drive thru. 

Overall it's one of the better choice for SE Calgary."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and got their veggie burger and I was not happy at all. I have had so many burgers before but this place seem to be the worst. The burger patty itself was fine but the buns were stale and dry,  I had a huge piece of lettuce that was from the core ,and the burger did not have enough sauce. I asked for sweet potato fries as well which was oily and I also asked for chipotle mayo sauce which they did not put in the bag. I only got one ketchup packet and I don't know how that was supposed to satisfy both my burger and fries... it's not like they gave me the chipotle mayo sauce for me to use instead..... overall pretty much disappointed the only thing made me give them 2 stars would be the root beer and how nice the drive-through lady was but I guess it doesn't really matter since she forgot to put the important stuff in the bag"}
{"text":"It's a little trashy, but they have root beer on tap in chilled glasses, and it's certainly a step up from Mickey D's for not a whole lot more money (if any at all)."}
{"text":"Okay, I realize this is fast food and the hallmark of fast food success is consistency, so, once you've tried one of whatever brand essentially the idea is you've tried them all. But not here. 

This location of A&W was well researched. Due to the neighborhood being so close to the financial district and businesses closing down early with little left in terms of food but pricier restaurants and the only food courts closing by 6pm at latest, this was a prime spot to put in an A&W for the hungry masses of employees close by who were tired of $20 dinners while at work. 

The employees are incredibly friendly. They know most of the staff from my work by name now, and always smile and wave at us when we enter the restaurant or are walking by. They've been very gracious to accommodate late breakfast requests and the food has always been well prepared and fresh. I typically take my lunch to go, but have dined in a couple times and the restaurant is clean as well.

The burgers and staff and poutine are awesome. I'm a big fan. Go!"}
{"text":"A&W had the worst food amongst all the major chains until a couple of years ago...Things have gotten better, but their service hasn't improved...!!!

Stopped for lunch and ended up with a nasty viral...!!!

Yep, it's true...There was only 1 sever across the counter and she managed to get me to hate A&W with gusto...!!!

We got 2 of the Mama combos...I asked for Ice Tea WITHOUT Ice, and got my mug with a handful of Ice Cubes...Went back and the server threw out the ice and refilled the jug with 4-6 Ice Cubes...!!!

By now there was half a mile long lineup at the counter and still only 1 register open, so I plucked out the Ice Cubes myself...

Food was fine, but the fries were filled only to half of their intended capacities...

We were in a rush and I gulped down the drink on the way out, and I ended up swallowing ONE Ice Cube, only ONE...!!!

It's been 5 days, and I've yet to cleanse myself of the nasty viral...!!!

But for someone like me with a bad set of Tonsils, the damage was done...!!! It was a bad mistake setting foot inside an A&W, and it won't happen again in this lifetime...!!!"}
{"text":"Buddy burger is the best for a really cheaper in eat. Can't go wrong with 3.50 for two burgers! Service is also really good and there is rarely a line so the burgers are made fast."}
{"text":"Clearly better then McDonalds of course the service is slower because its better quality food, Stefan H. needs to learn that the client is always right half diet = ask them to pour another 100% diet, everytime I complained I got a free meal whenever they made a misstake. Also they let me in the store with my roller blades wich is GREATLY appreciated since most places force me to remove them... best place eeeeeever (for cheap fast food in the east)"}
{"text":"Dark days in paradise. Sam the man was not manning the till, instead she hand crafter out meal. We asked for the true vegan burger, and by god they delivered. Although I do believe that the tomatoes on the sandwich would have cast a shadow while growing. Red hat update: no red hats today, but there was a red beanie. We did however get a chance encounter with the evangelical Sam as she checked on us, her loyal followers before leaving to grace the rest of the world with her presence. Over all it was a good visit before viewing the master piece of a film that is cars 3 directed by the awe inspiring Brian Fee. I hope for a cameo by everyone's favourite, Nicholas Cage. We welcomed a new initiate to the a&w review family, his name is pat-not to be named-rick. And as always Sams our man even though she's not a man."}
{"text":"Looks like there is a bit of confusion here. This is the location inside of Chinook Centre at the food court, not the one in the Home Depot parking lot across the street. 

Coming in to Chinook a little while before the mall opened on a Sunday morning my girlfriend and I were looking for something to eat. Though most of the food court was open, we wanted some sort of breakfast food option and this seemed to be the only choice. 

There was a bit of a line, but the staff handled it quickly and it was soon our turn. We went with the standard combos with OJ. When I asked what brand of orange juice they stock the employee didn't know. Even the dispenser just said \"Orange Juice\" on it. As they carry Coke products I'm going to guess its Minute Maid, but I can't be sure. 

My sausage and egger was probably the most fresh breakfast sandwich I've had at an A&W. When I go to most stores, they always seem to have a couple waiting under a heat lamp. Not on this morning. We had to wait for one to come out of the kitchen in the back. It was a pleasant change."}
{"text":"IT'S FINALLY OPEN!!

As Mike has said before me, it took a good six months for this location to open after the 7-eleven before it closed down. I'm guessing that the length of time it took to open this location is because it is a concept store so they're weren't following their tried and true platforms for opening a new restaurant.

What makes this a concept store? You'll notice that everything except the colours are different. There's still the old orange and brown that you come to expect, but there's A LOT more stainless steel. Everything about this location is uber modern.

The biggest thing you're bound to notice is the large white pillar just to the right when you enter. This pillar holds two brand new self-ordering kiosks. Tonight when I walked in there was a line 4-5 people deep but no one was using the kiosks. People seemed to notice them but didn't use them, maybe because they were paying cash.

The kiosks are very easy to use. You just use the touch screen to place your order. The first screen to come up asks if you want a combo or individual items. If you choose to order a combo you pick which one you want, then can customize your burger (They charge for extra lettuce, tomato, and cheese). After that you choose your side, which shows the additional costs if you want a salad or poutine. Finally you pick your drink. 

The kiosk then bumps you back to the main screen where you can continue to order more food or choose to check-out. You can pay with Visa, Master Card, or Debit. You do the normal thing with your plastic and the kiosk spits out a receipt.

When you've got your receipt, you go up to the self-order pick-up area to grab your food. No need to stand in line.

Other differences to this restaurant are nicer furniture, a stand-up freezer where they keep the mugs frosty, a wall with coasters on it so you can take a little souvenir with you, the burgers come in a paper sleeve not foil, and the fries come in these little stainless steel baskets.

The menu is the same as normal A&W's (at least as far as I could tell) but the menu boards stand upright on the counter instead of being overhead. 

Overall I had a great experience. The self-order process was seamless. I had to wait a little longer than I would expect for my food but that was because I had a veggie burger in my order which always causes things to slow down. The staff were friendly and apologized for the wait."}
{"text":"Sullen bunch of kids working here. Smiles are certainly extra.

Its fastfood but come on. A little service goes a long way. Not much to say about the food, ya'll know what's up there. For me, its rings and grandpa burgers plus a large root beer. The great thing is they have the frosty mugs!"}
{"text":"Overall, very impressed with this location. They manage to keep the line moving and crank out the food relatively fast. They also manage to smile and be generally pleasant to all the tired and cranky passengers who line up here.

The food (burgers and amazing onion rings) is served hot, while the root beer is cold.

They do have seating, though like at most airports it can be a challenge for them to bus the tables quickly and for you to navigate the parked luggage to claim a seat."}
{"text":"When I go into a fast food restaurant in Toronto and the employees go out of their way to be friendly and helpful, I am impressed. I had a great experience with primo service here, as well as a tasty burger with the best onion rings around.

I hope this location values the ladies who were working on Saturday, June 3rd, as they are all fabulous."}
{"text":"A&W has arrived in The Junction.

This location is ideal for that late night after drinking too much burger, as well as breakfast before hopping on the bus.

Service is a bit slow during peak times. On the weekends at lunch, lines are still long, and it will take time to place and receive your order. You will find ample seating in their dining area most of the time. 

All-in-all they have a good burger and tasty onion rings. They also maintain the tradition of serving root beers in frosted mugs for dine-in customers.  Not sure if the \"no hormones/no antibiotics\" beef affects their prices, yet expect to pay 2$ more per person than you would for a comparable meal at a Wendy's. (Though not to worry because there are none of those near here.) That being said, it is nice to have a reasonably priced, quick service option in The Junction."}
{"text":"Nice convenient location and hours and a friendly staff can't make up for mediocre fast food chain burger."}
{"text":"I like A&W but this location just seems so inconsistent, sometimes I receive my meal and its on point, other times and this has happened a lot here my bun is hard or burnt on the edges. 

The times I have my meal and its perfect makes me come again but the horrible time are outweighing the good times now, so I will only come here as a last resort as its one of the few 24hr spots in the area"}
{"text":"I often stop by here after dropping off my son at school, and I order the classic combo breakfast (2 eggs sunny side up, 2 strips of bacon, hash browns, and 2 pieces toast with black coffee). They offer free WiFi but LTE at this location is much faster. Staff are friendly, the regulars aren't too loud. Very different vibe from Subway, and that's OK."}
{"text":"While the restaurant itself is on the small side, it has a large parking lot, so if you want to stop in and get some work done using their free WiFi, it's eminently doable. The food is standard A&W fare of course, and they have chilled mugs for dining in if that's your preference."}
{"text":"My son and I come here for the friendly service and predictable A&W quality (root beer float!). The drive-through is popular, the available dine-in space is tiny - some folks have bigger walk-in closets."}
{"text":"WARNING - Do not go here. My coney dog was DISGUSTING and bland. Based on the dirtiness of the establishment I shouldn't be surprised. The place is rundown and almost looks abandoned. The workers look to be stoned and not even alert. All of these red flags and I still gave them a shot; bad idea. The manager is also extremely rude and needs to be fired. Don't waste your time here. The health department needs to shut them down."}
{"text":"I generally don't pick at fast food restaurants, I understand that for many it is their first job and they are inexperienced in professionalism and attitude. However today I noticed something to me seemed just wrong. It first took a longer amount of time than usual to be served at the counter while there were two girls manning the drive through. Firstly someone should always be minding the front, a drive through should be convenient but I should not be kept waiting while 3 cars are ordered and served before me. But then also when someone came out and greeted me they were interrupted by an off duty staff member who came behind the counter to tell them off for moving things around and reminded him to void a previous transaction. Having worked in a fast food restaurant myself I do understand the importance of keeping things constant for each shift and keeping track of things that need to be voided or put through. But that being said an off duty staff member should not go behind a counter while not in uniform, any staff member should not berate an employee in front of a customer, and lastly any staff member should not interrupt a customer about to order. I would have understood the need for interrupting me if they had been about to leave, but the staff member in question sat in the restaurant for a good 30 minutes after I had placed my order. Although I'm sure not every employee at A&W behaves in such a manner, I just felt it was very unprofessional and I felt mostly bad for the boy who seemed flustered after being told off."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, it takes over 5 min to serve an order of fries. And only one more person here besides me. They are not busy."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at this A&W today.
I must say, I get why some folks recommended their breakfast to us.
You can get a full cooked brekkie -- eggs, bacon (or sausage), hash brown, texas toast (brown or white bread), with jam and a large cup of Van Houtte coffee for about $7 a person.

This particular location does not have a lot of seating, but it was early and we had no problem finding seating.  They cooked it all to order and so we had it hot and fresh.  We noticed a lot of folks getting the full breakfast \"to go\" as well!

So if you want a quick full breakfast at a great price (drink included), check it out.

Pssst!! The Bacon and Egger sandwich is also pretty good."}
{"text":"A&W is usually pretty good.
I like their Buddy Burgers and Teen Burgers.

Today's experience was a little more \"meh\" though.
Since in the past I have had good meals from this place - I gave them a 2 but I might have gone for 2-1/2.

Tried the new Maple Chipotle Papa Burger.
It was ok --- a bit bland.  I ordered with Rings and Root Beer.
The rings were not great -- greasy and the batter was in bits in the bag.  There was not one ring intact.  

On top of this, I was sitting outside (they have 3 small tables), 'cause it's a nice day.
...and this guy at the next table pretty much pulls up his chair to my table.
I am like \"what are you doing dude?  Go sit at your own table.\"
He says he doesn't want to sit in the sun. Plus - he is eating food from the nearby Hot Dog cart, not A&W!! ... AND the 3rd table is empty with an umbrella.

I'm like -- you know what -- you take the darn table - and I move to the empty one.
Geesh!!

Will probably steer clear for a while.
Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Always quick service because you don't encounter the type of line ups that you find at McDonalds and Tim Horton's.

I also don't feel too guilty eating their food since it is hormone free. Definitely give it a try if you are not feeling like Tim's or McDonalds."}
{"text":"Just went in today and noticed that they rearranged the seating. It is no longer as spacious."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of the food quality here, but one late evening they were the only thing open so I gave them a try. 

I was completely surprised. Now the beef isn't ground in house, but everything is made to order and with a smile. I've never had my food (except fries) waiting under a heat lamp. 

The buddy burgers (double, with cheese and extra onions) hit the spot and the fries were hot and crispy. No complaints."}
{"text":"Brand new location. Arrived around 11am on a Friday and it was quiet. The staff were friendly and prompt. Food was fresh and very tasty. The facilities are nice, they have hand washing stations near the condiment area, with a kids sized sink too. They do recycling and even compost disposal. Have a big fridge with chilled glasses for root beers if you're staying to eat. The family washroom is big and clean and nicely appointed. Saw a staffer comp a meal for a couple because they missed the woman's order. They insisted without the customer even asking. 

All around great location. And the onion rings, if you've never had A&W ones you must. They are outrageously good."}
{"text":"I don't often go to A&W fast food restaurants but stopped off here for lunch since I was close by and felt like a root beer. The place is accessible outside and if you know where you are going in the underground city, you can get to this place from the McGill metro station without going outside (in case of bad weather).

The place has free WiFi although it wasn't working properly for my phone during my visit (after connecting, it tried to load up the browser page which I'm assuming is a terms of usage page but never managed to open it up). If you are paying by credit card, they have an automated terminal that you can use to place your own order. I opted for one of their trios (burger, fries, and a drink). The burgers are okay. I am not crazy about A&W fries. They charge extra for onion rings (as opposed to Burger King and Harvey's which charge the same price for fries and onion rings. For the drink, I had diet A&W root beer which you can't get in any other fast food restaurant. If eating inside, you get the drink if a chilled mug with no ice which is good since most people like a cold drink but don't want the extra ice to water down the drink.

Only thing which would make this better is if they allowed for free refills similar to McDonalds and some other fast food restaurants. They do offer the occasional coupons. Without coupons, my trio (which I believe was one of the least expensive trios) came to around $11.32 so a bit more expensive than what I would normally order at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of A&W and my recent experience at this location certainly did nothing to change my opinion.

I decided to go with the Mushroom Mozza Uncle Burger (\"5oz 100% pure beef patty topped with grainy dijon aioli, real mozzarella cheese and grilled onions, served on a freshly toasted sesame seed bun\") because the picture made it look insanely appealing.

It was ready a few minutes later and it looked...different. I wish I'd taken a picture of it because the difference was astonishing. It was all smooshed down and the cheese was practically non-existent.

Tastewise, the burger didn't fare much better. The patty had clearly been sitting in a drawer for hours since it was dry and barely warm, while the other toppings were too sparse to make any real impact.

I also got fries and they were equally horrible. They weren't even remotely hot and indeed had gone soggy at some point.

The only reason I'm giving this meal two stars instead of one is because the root beer, served in a frosted mug, was delicious. But I could've had that at home."}
{"text":"Went in specifically for the Smokin' Habanero Chicken. Zero on the heat factor. I used the chipotle dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries and it was spicier.
The one at Wendy's is far superior and better tasting.
Wont be back for it.
Male staff member was more interested in hitting on a female customer than doing his job. Others were working while he stood behind the counter talking to the girl for over 5 minutes.... Just sad really."}
{"text":"Quality burger & fries combination choices.  What is distinctly unique about A & W is of course their brand of root beer is served in frosty cold mugs.  This is a great location in the heart of the Toronto Entertainment District for those near by night bar/club goers to stop on by for a bite after an exhausting evening of: half assed attempts at EDM dancing, standing around & taking selfies with their 10 friends (2 of which are really their friends), \"pre-drinking\", and chugging more booze later at the clubs; as this A & W location is 24/7 afterall."}
{"text":"Love the buddy burgers and the onion rings. Place is never crowded and staff are extremely helpful and courteous.
Now i want anti-biotics in my burgers :P"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Junction! I love me some A&W. This is a prime location too - right on the corner and quite hard to miss. 

They have your standard burgers and fries - all fresh and tasty. I usually go for a lettuce wrapped Mama burger with all the fixings. It's not advertised but just ask for it if you don't want the bun. They do a great job with the lettuce wrapping, it's not too messy, and I love that you can add caramelized onions to anything. 

The onion rings are also pretty stellar! Salty, thick and delicious."}
{"text":"I am a huge A&W fan, the number one reason is the root beer! I can buy the 2 liter bottle of their famous root beer right there. They also over ice mugs you can buy there too.

The service was really fast, I had a combo meal burger and fries. The grandpa burger has 3 slices of meat, it was great. The fries were cold, nor was the drink was kinda disappointed that my favorite root beer was warm even if there was ice.

Prices are comparable to other fast food joints."}
{"text":"It was a late night so we stopped off at this A&W place near our hotel.

Not much look interesting or reasonable. So we just stay with the basic burger.

The burger was just ok. Prices is just reasonable.

I got the mama burger and my GF got the papa burger.
(No, I did not get that wrong)
She likes double patties!

The burger is nothing special, not much taste and need seasoning."}
{"text":"Great service, food, location.  This A&W is located inside the Petro Canada gas station, open 24/7.  I like the breakfast here, better than McDonald's and other fast food places.  A&W advertises eggs and meat sourced from antibiotic free chickens fed grain-based vegetarian diet, and beef raised without hormones or steroids.

I tried their new Cheddar Jalapeno Buddy Burger today.  Not bad, but not much jalapenos.  It's only available for a limited time I heard.  Reminder you can request lettuce and tomatoes for free (only bacon and cheese they charge extra).

Remember to bring your Petro Canada points card (yes you earn Petro-Points for your A&W purchases here!).  Be sure to sign up on their website for coupons (free coffee, etc) : https://awcoupon.ca

I've had only good experiences here and their hours are super convenient.  Recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, somehow managed to be cold even tho we ate in. Service was slow. Cashier missed my onion rings, so I didn't get charged for a combo. When I went up to complain, she only asked if still wanted onion rings. So was charged separately for my meal, not combo price even tho she messed up. Another guy in the store was sat down eating, came up and had the same complaint. He and his buddy has been given part of their order and told the rest would be along. Wasn't."}
{"text":"Unlike most of the food places in Pearson, this A&W prices their food pretty close to what you'd pay elsewhere in town: not cheap, but not $15.00 for shrink-wrapped artisan dreck, either.

The pricing probably explains the huge lines, apparently at all hours of the day. The staff were working hard (and I saw reinforcements arriving), but they just couldn't keep up with the demand for food (or cleaning the tables). Other food joints take note: if you're hurting from a lack of business, it just might possibly be because your pricing is hurting your customers. Just sayin'.

For somebody on a low carb diet, there were three relatively safe breakfast choices (as long as you have a travelling companion on whom you can foist your hash browns and toast -- or you could possibly ask them to hold the carbs when you place your order, although I don't think you'd get extra proteins or fats in exchange).

If you're patient, you should be able to grab a seat, although it's not going to be a quiet, relaxing dining experience. (Granted, you won't get that in the pricier joints, either, given the constant announcements to tardy passengers to get on the plane before the airline throws out their luggage.)"}
{"text":"I remember A&W from my childhood. Aside from a couple of White Spot locations, A&W was the last place I remember seeing car hop service. (Yes, I'm that old! ;-) ) Over time, A&W seemed to be an endangered species: old locations slowly disappeared, and while new ones popped up from time to time, the new locations didn't seem to appear as quickly as the old one disappeared. No matter how fun and quirky their ads were, A&W seemed to be fading away.

It turns out, they weren't. On my most recent trip, I was amazed to see how many A&Ws there are these days. (None in town, sadly, but apparently everywhere else.) My guess is that their recent makeover with a big push on fresh ingredients and responsible farming has had a lot to do with that. (Personally, the news that you can get any burger as a lettuce wrap was the deciding point for me, but not everybody is on a low-carb diet, so that probably didn't have much of an effect on the market as a whole.)

We got to our hotel kind of late after a long shuttle ride, and we were pretty hungry, but not prepared to pay the prices listed in the hotel restaurant, and A&W was one of several fast food joints in the neighbourhood. We just kind of picked at random, but I'm glad that's the choice we made, because it was my first clue of A&W's revival.

It's still not going to be my first choice, because the only remotely low-carb side dish available is coleslaw, while most fast food joints have at least side salads, if not meal salads, as options these days. Still, the lettuce wrap was pretty good. (Or, possibly, I was just really hungry.)"}
{"text":"Late night in Scarborough so passed by the 24 Hours A&W on Warden & Hwy 401. We have been seeing a lot of A&W ads stating that they do not use any steroids, hormones or preservatives in their food which adds to the value of the product.

We went in the drive-thru and ordered a Papa Burger, Medium Fries and 2 Chipotle Chicken Wraps.  When we got home, we tore open our greasy grub and chowed down.  

Verdict:

Papa Burger (2 patties) was A-OK.  I have had better because it was a tad on the dry side.  I had to add a bit more ketchup and grated my own cheddar cheese to make it a little bit more wet and yummy tasting.  Also, it was $5.25 + tax which is a bit hefty for a medium sized burger.  No hormones, right?

Medium Fries (Russet Potatoes) - These were pretty bad.  They were soggy as hell!  I don't mind a tad soggy like Swiss Chalet fries but still, blah!  They may have been undercooked which would been a big factor.

Chiptole Chicken - This was my wife's order.  She said, \"Good\".  That's it.

It all depends who is frying up the food and how long it has been sitting there.  It was during the later hours.  It is good that it is open 24 hours in case you have a late night craving."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how amazing this location is! Other A&Ws I've been to were just typical joints with greasy food and dirty. But, this location is the complete opposite! It feels like a clean 5-star restaurant with great friendly customer service and the food is actually cooked perfectly. And the air circulation is great too. The breakfast here is really good, eggs cooked properly, hash browns were super crispy yet soft in the inside and not greasy at all. I'm definitely skipping McDonalds and the overpriced Sunset Grill from now on and coming here for breakfast. The prices here are much more fair since you get fresh ingredients and quality food. Kudos to the staff and the owner."}
{"text":"Just came here since this was the only place open after 3am. I had the poutine and spicy chicken wrap. I've never been to an A&W before so I was hoping it was gonna be mind blowing for some reason lol. The poutine was okay. It was waaaaay too salty, though. The chicken wraps were okay, too. Not spicy at all. I mean you get your monies worth so I really can't complain. This is a good place to come when you're drunk and nothing else is open.

Oh, my cashier was nice but the other cashier was rude and angry. I mean, I get it. It's late and you're dealing with drunks but I would think you would be a bit more wiser than to be bitchy with drunk people. They're just gonna throw the attitude right back."}
{"text":"I just ate a double teen burger with a giant piece of plastic in it. I wish I was joking. Today has not been a good day."}

Drive thru."}

(compared to McDonald's and Burger King)

I also LOVE to listen to music here, it's always better than my Spotify favorites list -_-

Talking about bad stuff, their french fries are lame and they don't clean their restaurant at night."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Take it for what it is, A&W is just another fast food chain. Since this was nearby the loft I was staying in Montreal back in November, I decided to go here for breakfast.

They have a self-serve order section right when you enter the store. I never bothered checking to see how it works, but it was interesting at the least. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with sausage and egg along with a large chocolate milk (as they didn't have 2% milk...I didn't expect that).

The breakfast sandwich tasted quite good, at par with McDonald's famous breakfast sandwich. The chocolate milk also tasted quite good, but it's just chocolate milk so it's hard for it to taste bad unless it's spoiled."}
{"text":"Ordered a double chubby chicken burger, a mama burger and 2 drinks. Came out to just under $17!  Extremely disappointed and disgusted with their pricing. Other locations are not like this one in terms of pricing"}
{"text":"Driving home at 7 am in the morning after a wonderful evening of partying and a good sleep deserves a good breakie and although I have always been a MacDonald's Breakfast fan I thought I should mix it up and try A & W on 14th Street.  And besides they have a drive thru and I wasn't  about to get out of my car!

I ordered two egg and sausage eggers and man they were good, dare I say better than Mickey Dee's.  I swear the sausage portion is quite huge, I honestly could only eat one of them in the morning and down it with my coffee, and the second one I had for lunch and it was quite enough for me

I love A & W burgers but now I am a new breakfast fan."}
{"text":"Hi quality burger, open 24/7 (important to me, as  I'm in from out of town with no car) clean store and attentive staff. Enough said!!"}
{"text":"Decided on a quick burger for dinner at the drive-thru portion. Ordered two Buddy Burgers cost $4.10. Got up to the window to pay, then waited to receive my order & waited, kid comes to the window and says can you go park will bring you the order when it's ready, except there's no cars behind me so why do I have to go park and check the rear view mirror and say to the window clerk there are no cars behind me why should I go park, and his reply is it doesn't look good to have cars waiting at the window. LOL so make my burger and I won't be here waiting nonsense customer service is out the window at that place won't go back and the burger was nothing special."}
{"text":"Classier than McDonald's. More expensive than McDonald's. Amazing location. I go every other week and the service is always fast. 

Mozza burger is and will always be the MVP. 
Tastes GOOD. Open 24/7. What more can you ask for?

4 STARS"}
{"text":"Canadian A&W is quite different from an American A&W, as I discovered when I came to order during a long stay at the airport while waiting for my shuttle to Banff. But that wasn't a bad thing at all. For fast food airport food, it was a-ok.

I got the Buddy burger, a slider-sized number, topped with caramelized onions, ketchup, mustard, special sauce, on a fluffy bun. It was pretty good! Not the best fast food burger I've ever had but the onions mixed with the mustard really made it. Kind of reminded me a bit of an animal style burger from In & Out in that regard. Not very beefy but if you just wanted a smaller bite, like I did, it's the right size. 

The real star, however, were the onion rings. Cornmeal crusted, not heavy or overly oily, and perfectly crispy. 

Root beer was as expected. 

Service was ok. Nothing to write home about. And the seating in the food court is a bit lack luster but for a quick bite before the bus it did the trick."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on the weekend, it was busy but the wait wasn't as bad. We got our breakfast combo,  like always, the sausage and egger sandwich is good,  the hash brown is better than other places more crispy. The three stars are  for the breakfast sandwich.

This is the second time that I ordered coffee and there are fly(s) around the cup and on the cup, which just put me off,  I took a picture, but I wont put it up because it really makes you not want to drink coffee from there. 

They have to work more on the cleanliness."}
{"text":"I am happy  A&W is now serving all day breakfast.The breakfast sandwich is very fresh and a cup of fresh coffee blends well with it. There are other options for breakfast too. Other than breakfast, I like the chubby chicken burger.. yummy .. wen you bite into it, you will immediately feel the difference between the other chicken burgers and A&W chubby chicken. The other burgers are also taste very good specially when you order onion rings and fries."}
{"text":"My best friend and I pass by this location almost every day on our way to work. We saw that is was opening soon and decided to grab breakfast here when it did. 

LOVED IT! The place is extremely clean and the staff is very friendly. We have been here a couple time since over the past few months and they made an effort to remember our names. We ordered and took a seat, and when it was ready, the lady on cash took the time to bring it to us. 

The food is unheard of for a fast-food chain. The eggs were real eggs (lol) and they were fresh. They butter your toast for you, and they do it perfectly! My best friend always raves about how much she loves the toast. The last time we went we had a coupon that we found on their site. It was 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, toast with butter, a hashbrown, and coffee all for 4.99! Definitely worth it.

You are expected to sort your garbage and put the utensils in the bin, but unfortunately a lot of people don't. One time, it was extremely messy near the clean-up area where you throw away your stuff and the lady at cash (same one, she's awesome lol) actually apologized even though it wasn't her fault and told us if we wanted, we could just leave our trays and she would sort and clean it later. A+ for customer service. Will definitely return.

Highly recommend for breakfast,especially if you have coupons!!!"}
{"text":"Food is well cooked. Service is above average. The prices are a little high but it's worth paying for the quality of food especially in this location in a yuppie area. It's always a good thing they are opened 24/7!"}
{"text":"Very fair restaurant in terms of prices. Staff go the extra mile and even offer guests coupons to try to help save them money when they are ordering. The food is high quality and served hot and fresh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not sure of the past bad reviews. Maybe they changed staff or owners, 

Been here about 4-5times in the past 10months.

2-3 times for breakfast, and lunch for the other times.

Staff has been friendly, and efficient.
Food is good, Burgers are always tasty!!

4 stars overall."}
{"text":"Todays visit was a bit dissapointing.

Came here around lunchtime on a Saturday.
They should be expecting a lunch crowd....

Tables were dirty, washrooms were smelly, napkins were not re-filled. This is the reason for 2 stars.

Food was ok, i really can not tell the difference between the burgers... teen and mama looks the same. Seriously, you expect mama or papa to be bigger than a teen, but apparently its not. If you look at the pic i posted with 4 burgers... you tell me whats what!
Each was single patty... 

Rootbear is good here because they serve it in a cold glass!
At the malls, they serve in a takeout cup, it taste a bit different.

Lots of parking, with a drive thru.

Nice location... but.. was not too happy today."}
{"text":"Certainly wasn't the best burger I've had
The Onion Rings were dry and flaky with way too little onion to be called thus.
So if it came down to going there in the evening i'd rather hit the BK across the street.

But they win points for being environmentally conscious
The pop came in a mug, the rings in a metal basket and the total paper use including napkin was less than a ping pong ball once crushed.
That is a winner i only wished other fast food joints would be as considerate.

They get points for being open 24 hours 7 days a week. I bet being right in front of the bus stop gets a lot of traffic at 3am from all the home travelers coming home from a night of partying.

But the best thing on their menu is their breakfast sandwiches. They also have the best tasting bacon. So getting one of their Bacon Eggers will make your morning!
emmmmm Bacon. 

Can't believe i'm rambling on about fast food."}
{"text":"Nice little location that has the retro look inside and out. Service was good and it did not take long to get my food. Food was okay but onion rings were a bit salty. They serve the drinks in frosted glass mugs."}
{"text":"How do I love A&W, let me count the ways. The food is awesome, the price is fair and the service is always good. And now that they have decided to go with paper straws it will definitely be my favourite go-to for the food I love. Thanks A&W, you ROCK!"}
{"text":"Je suis arrivé et il y avait personne au comptoir pendant des bonnes 5 minutes, une fois la personne arrivée le service ne fut pas très agréable, elle parlait à un de ses collègues en même temps. Bref j'ai déjà travaillé dans un comptoir alimentaire, je comprends qu'il y a des jours avec et des jours sans maïs là c'est un peu poussé. Bref j'ai commandé le végé burger avec une frite, je n'ai pas trop attendu et tout était chaud mais le service et à revoir."}
{"text":"Une belle découverte pour mon voyage au Canada!! Cette chaîne de fast-food utilise des produits frais et sa ce sent en bouche!! En plus les burgers ne sont pas préparé à la \" va vite \" et son plutôt bon même si le chois et souvent le même !"}
{"text":"Friendly service. But always understaffed in the mornings. Be prepared to wait 20 minutes for breakfast."}
{"text":"Considering this place is a food court fast food restaurant, I ordered a basic order of mama burger combo with normal fries and drink and they managed to take 20 minutes to make the meal. When I got my burger it was cold. 

My family that got us a seat already finished their meals by the time I walked there with my meal. I would not come here again.

I finished my drink and asked for a refill, knowing the hillcrest A&W location gives free refill, they said refill is $1. Wtf. Understaff, cheap, and horrible service. No thank you."}
{"text":"Location/Service:

The fast food joint is located in the same plaza as walmart. It is a stand alone restaurant. I love that it has a lot of parking. It is great that A&W is is now serving all day breakfast and because of it, my family and I go to A&Ws once a week for their breakfast. Their coffee is great and I love that it is unlimited refill. I don't normally visit this particular location because it is quite far us, but we were in the area on a particular day so we decided to go in. All franchises should be the same right? not really. 

A&W has this coupons thing where if you go to their coupons website and sign up, they will give you some deals. It is a great incentives because you get a free regular size root beer, an upgrade to sweet potato fries and some combo deals. However, the staff at this location is so particular about the coupons you use. Everyone MUST sign up using their phone in order to receive the deals. At other locations, if you just showed one coupon, and you order eight (8) of the same thing, they will still take it. Here at this location, everyone must sign up before they can give you the deals. That means, everyone must have an account. I didn't really mind that, but what really made me give this place 3* is that it is filthy! It is a fast food place so it is expected that people do put their garbage away after they are done eating but since most people don't, they just leave it on the table. During my time there, there were AT LEAST 5 tables full of garbage and the the garbage can was completely full. Tables were sticky and dirty. There were 3 people at the counter and instead of cleaning up the place, they were just talking to each other and laughing. There were only 5 people at the restaurant and no one was ordering at that time so perhaps that time could be used for cleaning? At other locations, the tables are always cleaned and the staff was always at work making sure the place was spotless, the napkin holder had napkins, the washrooms were cleaned, etc. The staff at this location needs to work harder and they need to stop slacking. 

Food:
The burgers are the same at every location. I like the big breakfast: there are eggs, sausages, bacon, a hashbrown and 2 slices of toast. It is probably my go-to. Coffee is great and it is unlimited refill, which I like. I particularly like their Root Beer. I love how they always put their mugs in the fridge and then pour the drink in when someone orders in order to ensure the drink stays cold for a long period of time! :)

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll return to this particular location but you can find me at other A&W locations."}
{"text":"Great fresh burger, superb service, it tasted like a $10 burger, that's how good it is."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for A&W especially given their new commitment to sound practices around food sourcing- it's actually quite miraculous, sort of like Chipotle. It's very good to see a fast food place attempt to source grass-fed, antibiotic and hormone free beef and eggs from chickens in pens that allow them room to move about. 

Anyway this is a beautiful property with friendly staff (love how the manager calls everybody \"dear\") and fast fast service. The food is, as another reviewer says, exactly like every other A&W and that's a good thing. I got a chubby chicken burger and fries and the coldest glass of water ever (how they managed this without ice I don't know but will try to figure it out). All fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This A & W's always makes good burgers.
It's my go-to when eating in the food court.
I used to just buy the baby burgers with cheese but now that I'm willing to eat a sesame seed I've branched out to their other burgers.
Every time we go here, my boyfriend asks me if I want a burger. I say no.
He buys two and I eat one.
They're just so good I can't resist, even if I've already had dinner."}
{"text":"So tonight was probably one of my worst fast food experiences ever. I leave work at 3am and I understand most of the A&W clients are intoxicated but however I am not. I work security at a local pub in the area. I walk into A&W..order a mozza burger w/onion rings and a root beer. I look at my receit seconds after I pay for the food and it says I have French fry as well, I explain to the night cashier that I do not want the French Fry. He tells me I have no choice, I have to take it and there is nothing he can do. Umm excuse me?..you don't give me the fry and you refund my money via the interact machine on my debit card?. He then tells me he cannot do this as he was not shown how. I was forced to pay for food I did not order and did not want. And the food I did get was barely warm. Worst A&W I have ever been to, they should be ashamed to put the name of such a good burger joint on the front of this place. Disgusted."}
{"text":"Hate & Love chain restaurant
Lets start the hate first
- Average price combo 9+ wtf
- mama burger lacks any sort of toppings vs its competitors if you want lettuce and tomato etc extra 75 cents hmmm at $9+ combo you inagine thatvwoukd be included.
- extra charge for their chipotle side sauce wtf its not even prepackaged and filled by the employees which theyre very stingy to begin with.
- slow service and clueless employees.
Now to the Love part
- breakfast is okay if its on sale or if uou have a coupon
- only buy here when you have a coupon. Their coupons compared to competitors are still more expensive.  Their coffee and tea is not the greatest and serve extremely hot.  I see fu8re lawsuits coming their way with how hot their coffee and tea is.
Any reason i continue to go here its a hope skip and jumo from my flat.  Other than that i would like them to step up their service and quality food.  I can go to harvey and pay 9$ for an anhus burger combo and have all the toppings my way.  
Place to eat if they have specials thats about it"}
{"text":"Moved 50miles out of the area and miss the hell outta a&w (they have none near us). They accept cards last time i came (which is awesome). When i visit family i make it a point to stop here........the cheese curds are AMAZING!!!! not like that garbage at dairy queen. The highlight is the draft root beer in a cool glass mug. The coneys are friggen awesome. Burgers are decent, floats are great......i got nothing bad to say i love this place so much i wish it was open all year round and wished i still lived near it. It's my favorite A&W of the ones out in that area. Sometimes the fiance' and i take a trip just to go here. I reccomend it to everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent onion rings, friendly service. The pop soda is a little bit flat, but overall not bad."}
{"text":"Remember when A&W had a bear as their mascot? That was pretty funny. I mean, a bear? Why a bear? Did the bear eat the burger family? 

Remember when Dairy Queen had Dennis the Menace as a mascot?

Oh, what a crazy, mixed up world.

I came here at 2:00am after camping out in my car waiting for a text message that would decide the fate of my evening. They had Sirloin burgers on special, so I bought one. It tasted, unshockingly, like an A&W burger.

Then I drove my car to a side street, ate the burger and promptly fell asleep. 

....

Seriously though, a bear? And it had a tuba theme song. 

What were they thinking?"}
{"text":"If the sign outside says you're offering \"2 Mamas With Cheese - $5\" and another sign says \"Prime Rib Burger $3.99\" and then you charge me $12 for ordering both, something is very, very wrong with your math skills.

3 Unfriendly Staff Members + 0 Greetings + 10 Minute Wait Time + 1 Massively Overcharged Receipt = 1 Customer Who Won't Ever Come Back Here

This place left my wallet feeling sad and my sodium counts off the charts. I came here because I needed a quick lunch, but I left feeling used and ashamed. Should I have checked my total before paying it? Well, yes. 

Should the guy working there have known what their deal was that week, given that it was hanging from roughly 18 different signs around the store? Also yes.

I gave this location more than one star because while I waited for my order I got to savor the journalistic insights of a free Calgary Sun. By that I mean, the Sunshine Girl of the day was sort of cute.

You have her to thank, A&W."}
{"text":"Once when I was in Highschool, we used to come here at lunch and there was this ballin' old dude named Phil who was the bomb. Phil would sneak us extra fries and pickles and stuff. He was like a kindly old Grandpa who somehow still worked in the fast food industry but wasn't jaded by it. It was magnificent. In fact, one time we arrived and he was driving his car in to the parking lot. He was so excited to see us that he waved, didn't pay attention and mashed into the dumpster. Bummer, Phil. But what a gem.

Phil is gone now. Last time I went here I wound up waiting over 10 minutes in their drivethru line for a poorly assembled burger that had definitely been sitting on the warming rack for the past millenia. Not good, but I was starving.

At least it was only $3. 

Bring back Phil. He should be the only old thing behind your counter."}
{"text":"I haven't seen an A&W stateside in years!  This place may be a fast food restaurant but they actually pour your root beer into pre-fridgerated mugs if you eat in. 

We order take out. I got the chicken burger and fries. Burger was pretty good. Service was good."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the quality and cleanliness of this fast food joint. They had free wifi, which saved us tourists for getting lost. Compared to the Burger Kings and McDonalds I frequent when I have no other choice in food, A&W provides fresh fast food with friendly service, which is now almost impossible to get nowadays. A great addition on the oh-so-busy St. Catherine street!"}

{"text":"\"Drinkers Unite!!!\"

Normally when I visit a foreign country, I try to make a rule not to eat the same food that I can get back in the U.S. (mainly fast food places) with one exception. . . when I'm drunk. Plus, there are not too many, if any, A&Ws in New York City. 

This place is pretty simple; chicken and burger sandwiches at 1, 2, or 3am. One positive of this place, besides fried food, is that this location is open 24 hours. Since this place is on Rue Ste-Catherine, which houses many bars and \"slorehouses\", it is a quite populate late night hang out and beer/wine/booze-soakup spot. 

The only annoying comment is more about the people that go there and less about the staff. Since less than 4 people are working at 2am, the place can get a little mess because of all of the rowdy folks that leave crap everywhere. 

One tip: if you are leaving Montreal and you have not eaten at Poutineville, just have the poutine here for your poutine fix.

Happy drinking and eating."}

Okay...I just love that there are more A&Ws popping up including one near where I work. Yips! 
I was at an event and hadn't eaten for hours. So walking up Yonge street, this was a nice surprise! It is SO CLEAN and MODERN inside. For the busy lunch period, you can order via a self serve kiosk. Craziness. 

I ATE 
it's all about the teen burger combo. Especially if you're starving. It comes with fries and a huge draft like glass of whatever you want to drink (they usually default it to Root Beer). 
I also like those chicken fingers. Mmm. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
A good choice in the competitive fast food market. It's not healthy. But you don't come here for that."}

{"text":"this place surprised the heck out of me.

friendly service. clean and spacious space. 

but this burger place had what none of the current burger places have... nostalgia. the teen burger was the teen burger i remember as a teen. the bun was warm and toasted. the patty was juicy. all the toppings were fresh. it was really delicious. and the root beer was ice cold.

definitely a place I'll come back to."}

We tried the mama and the papa burger. The only difference is there is an extra patty on the papa burger. There was no fixings on the burger except for a little bit of onion and a couple of pickles. I found it bland. I'll skip it next time"}
{"text":"Harvey's has always been my favourite fast food burger joint but I think A&W is a very strong contender. 

I've seen a lot of A&W commercials on the health benefits of their meats like hormone free, pesticide free etc so weird to say, I actually felt healthy for eating a burger!  I had the teen burger because it was the only burger that comes with lettuce and tomatos. Gotta have a balanced meal with veggies and a of course a side of fries.  While the burger was very juicy and tender, it didn't have that charcoal taste like Harvey's that I like.  I was also bummed that my fries were soggy.  Harvey's is still my favourite but I think I will occasionally cheat on him with A&W."}

Close to King and John. 
This is my 3rd visit for breakfast. 
If you're looking for bacon and eggs this is the place. 
Eggs over medium done perfectly 3 for 3.

Bacon done just before it gets too crispy, perfect. 
You may not expect A&W to have a good breakfast but they do. 
Real eggs by the way!"}

{"text":"I'm always at the mall and between food court options, quite often I choose A&W because the food is always on point! Freshest burger in the entire mall. Breakfast always cooked to order. Yes service can use improvement considering the cooks in the back are invisible so you only see 1 storefront employee at a time. But that 1 person usually does a good job multitasking.

Ordered the all-Canadian breakfast special - 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, tomato, 1 hashbrown, and toast substituted with pancakes. Not greasy and the pancakes were neither too fluffy nor dense.

I guess I'm a regular! Good location."}
{"text":"Whenever I am around Canada's Wonderland or Vaughan Mills, I tend to fill up at this Petro-Canada location. Gas prices are cheaper in this area. 

After filling up my car's gas tank, I noticed that there was an A&W restaurant attached to the gas station's convenience store. I didn't want to hog the gas pump that I was parked in front of, so I visited the drive-thru. 

I first visited A&W as a teen at Scarborough Town Centre a while back. When I moved to Winnipeg, the chain was everywhere, including a, back then, new location across from where I used to take the bus to get the work. I would order the sausage 'n' egger after a midnight shift. As nostalgia got the best of me, I ordered it as part of the restaurant's all-day breakfast. 

I like A&W more than McDonald's as far as all-day breakfast items go:
- With any A&W breakfast sandwich, you have the option to get it on an English muffin or sesame bun
- You can get a hashbrown, fries, or onion rings with your combo

I love these options! I also got a diet root beer. 

My order took a bit longer than expected, so the kind guy at the window asked me to park in front of the restaurant. I'd say that no more than five minutes later, he came out with my late lunch. He apologized for the delay and wished me a great day. Nice!

I like that the hashbrown, and sausage 'n' egger were in individual, recyclable little bags. No oil from the hashbrown transferred over to the main brown bag, which is often the case at McDonald's. 

My breakfast sandwich was yummy! My hashbrown was a nice rectangle of goodness that wasn't too salty. I loved my drink. 

I need to visit A&W more often. This late lunch hit the spot.

{"text":"This A&W location is the closest one to my workplace. A colleague had pointed it out as I drove them back to work from Montana's, which is in the same area. 

I recently did a staycation in Mississauga. I decided to grab a bite here. I went through the drive-thru. 

I like the all-day breakfast menu at A&W. If you don't like the rectangular, yummy hashbrown, you can substitute it for onion rings or fries. I love the sausage and egger. You can get any breakfast sandwich on either an English muffin (that's me) or a bun. 

I had to repeat my order twice at the speaker. She was more concerned about my meal taking eight minutes to make than my wanting a hashbrown and a diet root beer with my meal. 

The drivers in the two cars ahead of me seemed confused. We all waited there for ten minutes. Suddenly, I see the car two ahead of mine get waived around to the second drive-thru window. The car in front of me honked and left. Huh?

I pulled up. The woman came out of the restaurant and rattled off an order that I didn't recognize. I indicated what my order was and she advised to pull ahead.

I paid using my debit card. I was asked to pull ahead and park. I did. Moments later, I got my food. 

It seemed like this restaurant was understaffed that day. I waited for a good twenty minutes. Luckily, I wasn't in any hurry. I looked at the long lineup in the restaurant and only saw one person in the kitchen area. 

Despite all that weirdness, my food was yummy and hit the spot.

{"text":"I have been to this A&W on several occasions, as I am often in this area to visit Winner, Staples, and Walmart. 

I typically go through the drive-thru. The food is decent for fast food and I am rarely waiting for more than five minutes for my order. 

Today, I decided to dine in. I ordered a mozza burger with fries and a diet root beer. The drink comes in a frosted glass, which is perfect on a 22°C day. Everything was delicious, probably because I was hungry and had lunch just before 4 pm. 

There is free wifi I the restaurant, which helps me write a long overdue review!

The place is clean. In fact, one woman is sweeping and I write. The other one is wiping the the tabletops down. 

I was the only customer here. Oddly, another visit met decided to sit at the table next to me, with her bag on the chair like I have, and facing the same way. Copycat? Perhaps. =)

{"text":"Great for take out, but dine in service is too cramped and too crowded.
I ordered a Teen Burger , Onion rings and Roobeer to go.
Burger was cooked and dressed to perfection, the onion rings crispy and the
Rootbeer was very refreshing.
Pleasant staff and friendly service, I will take their burgers over McDonalds any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great teen burger, but unfortunately the onion rings didn't cut it. They were soggy and very greasy. A perfect onion ring will be crispy and less greasy. This was my 2nd time in two visiting an A and W restaurant (the other was their location at Spadina and Queen Street.
The drivethough here was very fast and effecient, and the onions rings were cooked to perfection I would have given them 4 stars. Steroid free hamburger makes a big difference!"}
{"text":"All the meals are good . They take much more care than the local McDonalds or Tim's to keep the washrooms and tables clean.      We use the coupons which arrived in the local mail.     The staff generally keeps the music down , as we feel it is not worth being in a local fat food / coffee shop  if the music  is causing deafness forcing people to yell or give up on any attempts at conversation."}
{"text":"Relaxing dining room to dine in. Friendly staff here as well. Fresh fries served in a fancy mini fryer basket container, real old-fashioned style. Nice, frosted glasses served for root beer. Free drink refills. Great place!"}
{"text":"Waited almost 20 minutes in line so that the guy that arrived after me gets served. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and customer service in this A&W. There is clearly a lot of regulars and an ideal meeting place to chat over a coffee, brunch or burgers. I come here a lot just to break up my day as I work from home, and it is always a pleasant experience. I especially like their coffee and sausage eager."}
{"text":"Why should I rate a simple place like an A&W?   Because I can!  

Being that I'm American and have been here all week, I decided to try a little piece of home here in Laval.  

The service was good, the food as expected and I even ate it outside under the stars. (Yes, there is even outdoor seating). 

Be sure to get a Rootbeer with your food! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came at midnight , service was horrible and the guy preparing the food was not wearing any hand gloves or having anything on his head , I got disgusted . It's a disaster"}
{"text":"a&w is pretty good. i had actually never been to one before other than for root beer floats. ikr?

so i decided to finally try it and ordered a teen burger combo. it was quite good, and don't have any complaints about it at all actually. but i think this was too safe of a burger to realyl say anything on. I think i'll have to give the uncle burger a go."}
{"text":"3h du matin un samedi et pas de plat du quebec renommé : LA poutine ?? C'est un sacrilège. 

Wtf esti de resto de marde. Les burgers sont giou et taste quand meme"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today and had a disappointing meal. For starters, they  don't serve decaf coffee.  Also, their coupon for free pancakes only applies to breakfast specials, not their classic breakfast.  Why not just offer the pancakes with any breakfast meal?  Too expensive for what we got.  The only positive thing was the free and ample parking."}
{"text":"Amazing cook . The food was fresh and tasty and I live all the way in Toronto so you know it's good"}
{"text":"Needed a burger fix. Walked the whole mall to find this place. Finally found it and they would not accept my coupon because my phone showed I'd already redeemed this offer. (Didn't know they kept track. So what if I want to use the same offer again next week? ). You'd think they could keep a couple of coupons under the counter to scan the code. 

And no company phone number to call. To contact the company, you have to fill in a form. Went elsewhere and won't be coming here as often."}
{"text":"I don't tend to review fast-food joints because, well, it's fast-food.... however, this place does stand out above most A&W's.  The staff here are friendly and on-the-ball.  The place is always clean and it's run like a well oiled machine.

Observing the employees, they take pride in their work and when it's not busy they are actually finding things to do and not just sitting around talking like most employees in this line of work."}
{"text":"This was an ok Burger joint. This chain is big in the Canada world. I only know A&W from root beer as a kid.  The fries were tasty and the chicken grilled sandwich was flavorful. Nothing stood out as outstanding but it was a solid meal. The workers at this place are very attentive and work hard and fast."}
{"text":"I ordered Uber eats from this burger joint and spent $31 plus and it wasn't worth paying that amount. The burgers weren't worth paying that much. I regretted using uber eats there after."}
{"text":"Small piece of lettuce, limp bacon (not crispy), mound of onions = bad burger. 

I always order the teen burger and this is the worst I've had."}
{"text":"I usually come through the drive-thru and it is a rare occasion that there is anyone else in front of me. The only time I've ever seen this place busy is on a Saturday morning. With all of the coupons they mail out I guess the breakfast crowd likes a good deal.

The staff have been a little better as of late. They seem to be a little quicker and more cheerful. Good to see."}
{"text":"Probably the only 24hr drive thru in the area so when you're leaving Shanks or Ranchmans this is your greasy spot to stop."}
{"text":"I lied. For a quick takeaway bite, the a&w burgers are not the worst. At least they taste real and I like their fries too. 

Yes, I changed my mind. Yes, I'm allowed to. Yes, I'm a Libra. Sigh.

I RECOMMEND- the double mozza sandwich"}
{"text":"The best burgers (yay for teen burgers), although service was sketchy at times. But times can change. What I do remember as the best was you'd get the rootbeer in the glass and it would freeze a little disk of ice on the top it was that cold. Freaking delicious. How I miss eating that kind of food... ahhh, the memories."}
{"text":"We found the building quite interesting looking.  It looked like a drive in diner.  I half hoped someone would roller skated to our car.  Just kidding.  

We only stopped by for ice cream in soda on a Saturday.  No, it was not on the menu.  Almost like a secret menu at Starbucks.  The code words were \"Root Beer Float\".  There you go - vanilla ice cream on root beer in a cold mug ($3.70 tax included).  The cashier was friendly and fast.  We didn't experience service issues.

When done, be a boy scout and put the mug on the tray that is on top of the busing station."}
{"text":"Good: The interior shames other fast food restaurants. Self-ordering system. The food was good.

Bad: Self-ordering system is extremely loud.

Ugly: Food preparation is a little slow"}
{"text":"The food is standard A & W quality.  The problem here is the cleanliness.  I took my son here today and we could not find a clean table in the place.  There could have been a dozen employees but not too many eager to clean tables and make the dining area hospitable.  This is unacceptable.  Please don't take business for granted.  Get someone with a CLEAN cloth properly wiping tables and chairs.  The food is greasy in general and more care needs to be employed here.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Cue tuba music. 

You know you've hit rock bottom when the best you can do for late night munchies is A&W. In truth, my dining companion and I were in the mood for something trashy and quick and it was well past midnight. Yes, there are other late night eateries in Toronto but I had just the slight inkling for grease and root beer and A&W shot to the front of the pack.

Though I was looking forward to trying the self-ordering kiosks, they were not functional that evening. Fortunately, the human behind the counter was virtually emotionless, so it was almost the same thing. Even though I ordered my meal 'to stay' wishful thinking on the part of the burger robot had her throw everything in a bag. I guess they wanted us to GTFO. I didn't mind not getting a tray, but I missing out on the frosted mug bummed me out. Sad. Face.

The decor here is a notch above your typical fast food set up. Heavy steel chairs, varied seating, decorative pipe fittings all over the place, rich orange and brown walls with pastel highlights, etc. You might even call it haute fast food if there were such a thing. Except that the the food here is par -- neither good nor bad. But I'll give them points for not icing down their drinks.

Obligatory Title Pun: ROOT for the home team.

Menu Readability: The only burger worth getting is the Teen Burger. Everyone should know this.

Need to mention: Did you know that A&W Canada is completely distinct from the American A&W? And that tuba-loving bear is a Canuck feature also.

What this place teaches me about myself: What is it about frosted glass mugs?"}
{"text":"The first one I had was in Ontario and I have been a fan ever since.  Why oh why are you not here in the States?  This is WAY better than Harvey's and it's raised without hormones!  This has got to be my favorite fast food burger place in Canada.  My only complaint is that the ones we encountered in Alberta closed too early.  I've had the papa with bacon, mama, mozza with bacon, sweet potato fries & hash brown.  The burgers aren't that big so it's a safe bet to get at least the papa.  The sweet potato fries were not oily at all and the hash brown was tasty too.  They serve burgers even in the morning which was a great stop off before the flight back."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times over the past few months and in my experience the food quality and customer service is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are quick and the burgers taste fresh and juicy while other times the wait is ridiculous and the burgers are almost hard to finish because of the terrible quality.

However, they are good overall and the fact that they are open 24/7 is very convenient."}
{"text":"As some of you may know, I am huge fan of A&Ws, so it pains me to have to give this particular location only a single star. 

This A&Ws is located in Vaughn Mills inside the food court area. I was pretty excited to use my coupons to get either two mozza burger or two teen burger combos with my date. Before you say anything, you should acknowledge the fact that A&Ws is a step up from McDonalds price wise. Anyway, we decided to order two mozza burger combos, with root beer, and one combo with sweet potato pries instead of regular fries. We sit down at our table and look inside the bag. To our disappointment, we didn't get our spicy potato fries (which cost extra btw). So my hot date generously offers to go back and tell them what happened. While she is doing all this I discover that I got a teen burger instead of a mozza burger. LOL   Our time was wasted during this whole ordeal so we had to go, but I would have been too lazy to complain regardless. Not worth the hassle nor the risk of getting the wrong burger a second time. That would be embarrassing. 

The burger itself was delicious but I got the wrong type of fries. For some reason the root beer tasted flat. My date agreed, here root beer was flat too. 

Overall my experience here was quite unpleasant. My date was left disappointed and I was too. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"A&Ws are basically the same everywhere

. . . but for some reason the Teen burger I ordered from this particular A&Ws was exceptionally delicious. This A&Ws is located inside Bramalea mall at the food court. I find A&Ws is quite pricey but it's probably one of my favourite fast food burger joints. They have this special seasoning that they sprinkle on their buns which is amazing. I usually order more of it on the side and dip my fries in it   #tip.  Luckily I received A&W coupons in the mail so this amazing burger only cost me $3.14 after tax. My girlfriend was like \"oh I'm not hungry Vlad, you just get something for yourself\". . . then she ended up eating my burger LOL. So needless to say I went back and used another coupon to order two Teen burger combos, one for now and one for drunk eats later. I definitely recommend this place. My burger actually looked like how it looks on the menu pictures, which is almost unheard of for fast-food places.  

My only complaint is that they forget to give me extra seasoning on the side but the burger was so yummy that I hardly even noticed. 

I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I try an avoid fast food outlets. But I tried A&W in the Chinook shopping center with two grand Childrne in tow. Burgers, small and not good at all. Post mix drinks, mostly soda water and very little of the syrup. Bad choice. Would not recommend this out let to anyone."}
{"text":"Went to A&W to try the teen burger special. I haven't had an A&W burger in over 5 years, last burger was not the same as today's and I'm glad it changed or it would probably be another 5 years before I would have one again. 
IMHO, the burgers have improved from years ago, good job at revamping the image of this previously dying root beer icon, but make no mistake, its not the same as some of the higher end burger places you find today places, this is still fast food and eating at the gas station supports just that.
Overall, I'd say it compares to other fast food burgers, really comes down to what you like, definately on par and okay for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Walked in, first time visiting a A&W restaurant instead of a gas station. Place was dirty, not with paper and trays but the finger prints all over the glass, stains on floors around edges, even the ordering counter had food and drink smeared all over it dirty. Needless to say, I was already put off walking in.
Ordered a teen burger combo with rings and a jr chubby chicken. Burger was bland, on the dry side, rings more of the same. Chicken burger had mayo and pickles which tasted mostly of pickles, chicken meat was okay, nothing  notable.  Overall bland fast food in a greasy dirty fast food restaurant. 
I even noticed money handled, food delivered outdoors and no one washed their hands. Pretty sure I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I read other Yelpers terrible experiences at this location. I personally have not had a bad experience here, fast food standard.
We always get an abundant amount of their coupons in the mail. So on nights where I am too lazy to cook, we just drive over and grab two combos; one for me and one for my hubby. We have been here a number of times, and service was good (fast food standard of course). We got our food in a timely manner.
I love how they serve their root beer in a frosted glass."}
{"text":"its a&w alright. if ur burger is too salty ask for no seasoning salt on the patty. there are floats, but no milkshake machine- few locations in canada actually have those. if its busy, u will end up waiting. if u got nothing better to do on xmas than leave bad reviews for fast food places i feel really sorry for u. why dont u request a fresh cooked patty if it means that much to u. u know u can customize orders here, right?
some ppl eh? lmfao"}
{"text":"The staple root beer float is amazing here. Always good quality. Free wifi and a good place to stop and enjoy the float"}
{"text":"Hmm, Sausage & Egger and Coffee - simple yet a good breakfast.  Did you know that all A & W's carry wheat buns?  You can substitute the white buns for all meals.  

The Drive-Through is open 24 hours.  

Service is very good here.  

Ample Calgary Sun newspapers for all who come to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on February 5, 2014.   There was a sign in the window, \"Washrooms are for customers only.\"   I got a chicken sandwich combo, which wasn't too bad.   Ketchup is stingily passed out from the counter, as are napkins.   Even if you are a paying customer, when you want to visit the washroom, you have to go UP TO THE COUNTER and WAIT until you can ask a counter person to \"buzz open\" the washroom.   Why they are so restrictive--and probably illegally so--where their washrooms are concerned is a mystery:   the one I visited wasn't that clean.   The policies here remind me of those restaurants that give you 1 1/2 to 2 hours \"seating limit.\"   I do not frequent those restaurants, because the idea of someone timing my dining experience with a stopwatch is too much.   I sent a complaint to A&W's corporate headquarters about the washroom policies.   I won't go back until this restaurant gets a major customer-appreciation makeover!"}
{"text":"One of the worst A&W that I have been to. the food wasn't too bad almost typical but the service was bad. Had to wait a long time before they even took my order when there was no one in front of me. Ordered sweet potato fries and apparently the people before me also ordered it so they did make a fresh batch but by the time it reached to me, it was at the end of that batch. Instead of making more they gave me less sweet potato fries and also mixed some french fries into it....

The burger was put together pretty sloppy too.

Mug was not frosted"}
{"text":"Service - terrible. This is supposed to be \"fast food\" right? We waited behind two people for a good 10 minutes just waiting to order. The staff seemed to be getting into disagreements with every customer, and having a great deal of difficulty getting the orders right. They also seemed to be getting into disagreements with each other. This was on a Sunday evening. Not a particularly high traffic time.
The food, just fine."}
{"text":"Charging $2.80 for a small chocolate milk. It's frustrating because it says the milk is 250 cal yet the small ones are only 150 cal meaning they are charging double for small milks. False advertising.  Frustrating. If I buy 2 I'm paying for 2 large ones but getting 1 large plus 2 deposit costs. Lol wow"}
{"text":"Using the drive-thru.
It seems like every other time I'm there, I have to wait a long time for my food. Last time was on Saturday September 9, 2017. I was asked to park my car, and they would bring the food out to me. I waited at least 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This is the highest Yelp star rating I've ever given to a chain restaurant, and it will likely always remain as such. Long live the bear on roller skates. 

Holy hell. I love root beer, onion rings and teen burgers and this location has a window into a historic Toronto music dive, where you can type in your order and be passed back the good stuff in a timely manner. The Horseshoe Tavern even let's you nosh on your goodness inside. Praise be. 

This newish Queen W location is clean and decorated in retro A&W attire, all orange and brown, all the time. They even have an upstairs for your dining-in pleasure with windows over looking the bar-goer ridden block. Great people watching. 

PEPPER POINTS for the poutine. A&W poutine is really salty and good. 

Jeepers. Who am I? I'm feeling some serious chain shame right now."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I had in Brampton,the eggs were undercooked,I had to explain my order 3 times,my bacon and sausage we're served in napkins cause the 3 girls working said it was against their religion to touch pork products,my coffee was cold and so strong that it looked like mud,plus toast was cold and butter was just pasted on, anyways two bites and a sip of coffee was enough for me and everything went in the garbage and I walked out,I will never recommend or go to this location again."}
{"text":"In a hurry needed a quick bite. Decided to try A&W for the first time. Ordered a Teen Burger. It was dull, ridicules, tasteless, crusty, not worth my time and expelling the energy required to chew. 

Save your money. 

Go to Walburgers instead. 

A&W makes crappy burgers. I would have rather eaten a pound of kale then their burger."}
{"text":"came here for some food, was an ok experience nothing to brag about. the food was fresh and hot, the location is open 24 hours a day which is nice, I was not a big fan of A&W taking my money for a order and then coming back to me to say that they ran out of stock on items and to do a substitute. no Bueno. 
in the time of my food cooking I had a chance to use the bathroom and I think a lot more attention needs to be dealt with in that aspect as well. 

parking options are directly on the street with multiple municipal lots in the area. 
transit options are the 501 queen streetcar and the 511 Bathurst streetcar with a bit of a walk. 

wouldn't go out of my way to come to this location, but also if I was in the area I would come here."}
{"text":"this location i would call below par at worst. 
they have newly renovated this location which is great, but having to go upstairs for extra seating is annoying at best. 
the service here is terrible, to the point where it took over 5 minutes to get my order even going, when i looked on the monitor of orders being processed, i was number 6 in the line up. i had a bit of time to kill so i asked to use the bathroom, all A&W's have a combination lock to let you in, sadly this location has a door handle like that, but its a very tough one to use, even tougher when the cashier gives you the wrong code. 
the bathroom is one of the worst i've been to in toronto, and this is coming from a guy whos used the bathrooms at sneaky dee's (not anymore but still) the toliet lid was off, the faucet had no handles, and the hand dryer had mold in the section that collects the water? 
DISGUSTING. 
after waiting about 10 minutes for my food to go, i was witness to many people asking what the hold up was on the food. i got my food and got out of the place, when i had a chance to eat it, i felt that the quality wasn't anywhere close to any of the other A&W's i've experienced as of late. 

i would very much never come back to this location due to this experience."}
{"text":"this location is better then average, as they are going on this campaign of real food, i'm a huge fan of this. this location is responsible for my new found A&W addiction. was able to come here before a concert awhile back and i was absolutely floored by all of the flavors that came about. 
the chicken jalapeno burger is absolutely amazing, the poutine made me take them down a point as i felt the gravy and cheese didn't match up together well, and the portion size was very small. i was extremely happy with my chicken burger though, the right amount of heat and seasoning for this wonderful item. 
i really hope that they keep it on the menu forever, as it is nice to find a place that has a awesome chicken option. 
this location has parking available on the streets nearby and some parking lots nearby as well. 
transit options are the 506 Carlton and the 63 ossington bus. 
im a huge fan"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5. Its a favourite joint for my family. We love the ambience and the way they bring to you the sweet porato fries / onion rings in a cute miniature silver frier .They serve hormone free chicken and beef which explains why they are a tad pricy over other similar joints. I also love their buddy burgers . The root beer is special and I personally like it."}
{"text":"Came here the other day after a long time. I am currently on a semi diet so I ordered the chicken grill deluxe (only 290 calories). It was super tasty for $5.95. The cashier was very friendly and helped me in making a choice that was health conscious. I stole a couple of fries from my friend's order and holy damn they were tasty. I wanted to just binge on these alone."}
{"text":"Only open for a few days, making it the cleanest A&W in the world. 
People walk around & refill your coffee. 
Food tastes identical to every other A & W which is a good thing. 
And it's open 24 hours which will be handy after too many drinks at one of the many bars on 17th Ave!"}
