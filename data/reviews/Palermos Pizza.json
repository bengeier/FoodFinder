{"text":"Pizza is ok, sauce is kinda bland,  but these wings are not good.  Wings have the taste of old or burnt oil"}
{"text":"A decent slice. Wings arent bad either. Again, it wasnt the cleanest place but I was willing to over look that. The taste of the soft drinks though is what I have issue with. With poor water quality in Buckeye, the hard water adds a funky flavor to drinks. Most restaurants have added filters to their systems and that may be something that Palmero's will have to invest in.  Dont be put off completely though, Palmero's does offer ice cold beers as well."}
{"text":"Always super nice and super clean inside. I haven't found a pizza place this good in a while. So if your visiting or just live here and haven't been go visit palermos's! Nothing better then original owners and nice Italian folks! Gotta love them!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place , foods delicious and leaves you stuffed but the restrooms could use some work but overall pretty nice place and I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"When I arrived I was greeted immediately. I called in my order and the associate that took my order was polite. My order was ready when promised. This was my first time here, the food was excellent and hot. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and a dozen hot wings. The restaurant was not the cleanest, that was my only issue. Overall great food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would!!! I have never had such a terrible service from a restaurant nor am I the type to complain about anything but this place just takes horrible service to a different new level. First, we call in to order two XL pizzas. The girl answering the phone says, oh we don't make them XL. Then I speak with Alex, and he says, oh don't mind her, she's new and doesn't know what she's talking about. Then after we placed our order in, they made a mistake and wanted to deliver our pizza TWO HOURS after our requested time. How can we keep a group of 12 people hungry for two hours????? The people running this place definitely would benefit from attending businesses courses because I am not sure if they are going to survive long term. I am so sorry to be doing this to you, but your service is BEYOND TERRIBLE. I would absolutely stay away from them and save all the headache!"}
{"text":"Horrible!  Might as well have order little ceasars!  Yeah it was that bad.  Sauce had no taste.  Sorry - this is a complete miss."}
{"text":"i would bring my son here almost everyday untill he spilt his cup of ..the old man got mad nd said its his falut he was very rude very rude..my son was upset i had my 6 month baby with us nd he basically didnt care if we stayed or left so i got all my shit my kids and we left  old man was rude all the way to the end..i mean damn i ate there through out my whole pregnacy ..almost ..so the old is my problem ..hes rude and not kid friendly ...very sad one of my favorite pizza spots i will never go back because of him that old man... 
the cup when it feel broke from the bottom the lid didnt even come off  the whole bottom of the cup ripped but whatever ..."}
{"text":"Absolute Best Family Owned Pizza Place I Have Ever Been To ... When you go there & they treat you like a very good friend & they have the best customer service. I am now a very loyal customer .... I would give them 100 stars for just GREAT customer service & delicious pizza :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Great people! Great food! It doesn't get any better than Palermos! These guys know what customer service means. I completely recommend a visit with the crew at Palermos!"}
{"text":"Super good thin crust!  Sausage shaved on top... so delicious plus they have great hot wings!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza is delicious, wings are good as well. Pizza is some of the best in the valley. Must try"}
{"text":"WE really enjoyed the pizza and the people. We really really loved the wings! Those were amazing. The ranch on the otherhand was not good at all. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. 
   Friendly service. 
Wow the pizza  and wings SUPER YUMMY  !!!!
me and my family love it"}
{"text":"Well, strongly disappointed. We asked if we could split a pizza with half Greek and half mushrooms, they said they couldn't. I don't know of any pizza place that can't split a pie! So we just need up ordering the Greek pizza which came with feta cheese, Greek olives, gyro meat, olive oil and mozzarella on it. We also order a piece of chocolate cake. 

Then they almost hung up with out us giving all the delivery information. 

I will say it did arrive quickly, if not for that I would have wanted to give it no stars. 

Once the food arrived the pizza was not how I imagined it to look... It was more like a white pizza with some olives and a lot of olive oil. The gyro meat was microscopic and rivers of oil flowed through the valleys of pizza. 

The chocolate cake some how transformed into a chocolate pudding pie on the way to my house. Don't know how that happened. 

Needless to say at the end of this experience we ripped up the delivery menu."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I eat a leftover slice from a Palermo's pie (aka pizza).  Ummm...yummy.  

I love the crust -- the perfect consistency of a Brooklyn pie, but slightly spicier sauce.  For those who like a sweet sauce, this may not be for you.   The  pies are reasonably priced.  The service and eat-in parlor are basic."}
{"text":"I've always liked thee food. Customer service- way better than most around here but nothing special. Who care because is eating there most times. 

Gd prce s for wings..dam I love their beings.. Just like LNG wongs. Order and eat!!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to pizza and wings joint. I get a mug of dos equis while i wait and it comes in a frozen mug. Love this place"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. Quick service and a large menu make this a great place to eat. The only downside is the seating isn't very friendly. Otherwise, this would be a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza/wing special. Pizza was OK but the sauce lacked flavor and the crust was not as crispy as I like it. 

The wings looked great, but the buffalo sauce was watered down and not very spicy.   

Service was below average but not terrible."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with the pizza. Service was a good and fast, but the pizza tasted like a dirty dish rag. My wife picked up a faint taste of rubbing alcohol. They need some help at this location."}
{"text":"It isn't the best pizza I've had, but it is BY FAR the best pizza in Buckeye, AZ."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wing specials.very affordable.cheezy tasty pizza.appetizers good and not expensive.if your a beer drinker they make the best michelada this side of the border.highly recommended.great for family and kids"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is annoying as hell. They keep stuffing these flyers in my door. There should be a law against that. 
One day, my room mates and I were pretty desperate for food so we just ordered a supreme pizza. You can't mess that up, can you? Guess again. The crust was burnt, there was barely any cheese, and the the vegetables were mushy, gross and outnumbered the meat on the pizza by far. Not to mention that our pickup took 10-15 minutes longer than anticipated and stated by the woman on the phone. 
Don't ever order from this place, ever. I'm so glad we didn't get it delivered so we wouldn't have to waste another dollar on this place by tipping the delivery boy. If you need an edible pizza around the university area, you're better off getting some crap from the freezer aisle or getting a pizza bagel from Einstein's.

Ooh, also, any good review around here is probably from the owners and employees. I'm definitely not the only one out of my peers that has had terrible issues with this place."}
{"text":"This is run of the mill pizza. It's not bad, it's just not great. Very greasy. Lacks taste. Run by a guy from Albania who is very nice. I would go back to try something different from the menu like one of their subs."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. It does get soggy if you order it for take out, but it is great if you eat there. The wings are awesome. Get the hot wings, you will really enjoy them.  The owner is quite the character. 
For a New York Style pizza it is fairly priced, but you are going to pay a lot more than Little Ceaser's, but this is real pizza. They also sale pizza by the slice if you want. 
Their larges are 16 inches not 14 inches (just a little math lesson, a 16 inch pizza (radius 8 inches) has 30.6% more pizza than a 14 inch pizza (radius 7 inches). Area is is pi times r^2. so it makes since that a 16 inch pizza is going to cost more.
They have a lot different non-pizza items on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm in Las Vegas on business from Washington, DC AND originally from NYC.  I've NEVER had a pizza that looked as good as their Vegetarian Pizza and taste so bad as a result of flavorless red sauce.  I've had many, many, pizza's over the years (I'm not a youngin'), but their pizza was THE worst I've ever had!  Honestly!  I ordered a 12\" pizza, ate two slices, and threw out the rest.  Their delivery was not slow, the pizza delivery person was pleasant, and the caesar salad I ordered was tasty.  Hope they can do something about their red sauce!"}
{"text":"The staff was polite and efficient.  The lunch 2 slice & soda special is a good deal.  The crust could have been a bit softer and pepperoni cooked more, the sauce was mediocre.  There were a lot of options, some reasonably priced, some oddly pricier than I would expect for a mom and pop type pizza joint.  Not craveable, but I'd be back if I was hungry and already in the complex."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and the sampler. The mozz sticks had now cheese in them and the pizza that I ordered with extra sauce had hardly any at all. Made the pizza taste bland. My lady and I both at a pieca and tapped out. The rest of the sampler tasted pretty good. On the fence on rather or not I will give this spot another chance. This was our first time trying this spot out."}
{"text":"Love, love, love it! I don't even live in AZ anymore. My husband is AD Navy so we move a lot. Good thing we have family back in AZ still or we wouldn't have an excuse to come eat here! The pizza rocks, it's addicting, not to forget the wings... The wings are to die for, they are the bomb! Crispy, spicy (or not) and just down right awesome. And the people are so friendly and great to be around. I can't wait to come eat their again in November :)"}
{"text":"This place probably has the best NY style pizza in Phoenix metro. The guys that run it are from New York and came over from Italy before that. They've been around for 20+ years so they are definitely doing something right. I always grab a pizza when I'm near this place.  Pizza's are pretty big but, all thin. Although, one large is probably big enough for a family to have a couple of slices.  Side note make sure you get one of the older guys to make the pizza and not their  much younger sons."}
{"text":"Always great food and fast service with a smile! I won't get pizza or wings from anywhere else."}
{"text":"I am actually really bummed because I moved to North Phoenix, and have yet to find a good pizza place up here. I have been going to Palermos for 10 years while I had lived in Avondale. The location on 83rd and buckeye, and 91st and thomas, are just the same.

These are my absolute favorite wings, anywhere, ever. They have the sauce calibrated to perfection. I am regularly yelled at as a wing hog by my family.

The pizza is really good. some people call it soggy, but I think it's just very soft. It is very thin, but they crisp it just right, to allow it to remain soft, with a very light crunch to it. the end crust is so freaking good, and that is always usually crunchy. The pizza is enormous. If you have kids, you can cut the peices in half for them. 

2 slices + 10 wings, and I'm wasted. Pizza wasted.

The dude there has been there forever, and he's friendly as hell. 

I cannot find a place like this anywhere on the northside!! :(

**Dip you pizza in the wing sauce**OMFG wow!"}
{"text":"This is a family affair & I love that it feels that way in a pizza parlor. The kids are running around during the family breaks to eat & the pizza is traditional NYC. The wings smell is intoxicating. You can't not order the special that includes wings. This is my sons fave pizza place close to the house. I love the family atmosphere & the bang for my hard earned bucks."}
{"text":"Sorry if this offends anyone.  I can't stand the place.  The only good thing I order is the meatball sub.  Even that could be better but it's filling.  The pizza is really not good at all.  I've ordered there twice thinking maybe the first time was a fluke.  Well, it wasn't.  The pizza turns out soggy even if it's burned.  Yes, they gave me a burned pizza!  The cheese that they use is super cheap and oily.  Good cheese should string if it's fresh and of good quality.  No, not the case at all!  I say, 'don't waste your money!'  Go elsewhere even if it means going to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"great place for pizza and wings!! the food was delicious and the staff are amazimg very friendly atttending and attentive. the restroom are very clean. overall great place....."}
{"text":"Palermo's, how are you today, ehh? Your pizza tastes like Million dollar, ehh? How are you?"}
{"text":"Hillbillies making pizza, reminds me of the freaks on wrong turn. Pizza thin and greasy wings small with very little sauce. Rude staff."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night dinner.  We stopped at this place and when we first walked in the place smelled great!  

Old men working the counter & making the food.  We ordered 2 pepperoni slices, special calzone & meatball calzone.   We are from NY and have high expectations so take this review as you wish. 

Pizza- son said it was NY approved & will be going back for more in the future. 

Specialty calzone- it was tasty & would order again. 

Meatball calzone- soft dough was so soft that it broke apart.  More messy than expected.  The taste was great and light to eat. 

It took a little bit for our order to be done but we didn't mind the wait as that means our food is made fresh.  The older men were great to talk to."}
{"text":"I have tried here three times now and the food is hot, fresh and delicious. Palermos has saved my family when we needed a hot dinner and everyone was too tired to cook. We had a pizza a calzone salad breadsticks and pasta all delivered hot and fresh. Another night I stopped in and had the eggplant dish which was delicious served with salad and bread. I recently stopped in and order chicken alfredo which was bland and needed more flavor. The hogie baked was pretty good and had salami, capicola and ham. I really enjoyed the fried zucchini I ordered. I would recommend calling in your order ahead as it took quite awhile to sit and wait for my food."}
{"text":"Palermo's Pizza is owned by a member of the same family that owns Lucky's Pizza, so the work ethics and the hospitality remain consistent. Palermo's Pizza is a clean, well maintained, family friendly Italian restaurant/pizzeria, serving authentic New York style Italian cuisine. There are no canned items served here. It's a  point of family pride and tradition to make everything on the menu from scratch; from the fresh pizza dough made daily, to the pasta sauce. Palermo's takes a special pride in the quality of the ingredients they use. You may have to wait a little longer for your order at Palermo's, because your order is cooked fresh at the time you order it. It doesn't matter if you drop in for a slice of pizza and a cold drink, or you're having a family reunion; the prices are very reasonable and you're always treated like family."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and have started to check out the local Pizzerias, so we decided on Palermo's a few nights ago. My husband walked in and ordered a large veggie with italian sausage. The guy at the counter suggested adding the fresh cut garlic to the pizza, we love garlic so why not !! Once he got home with the pizza and opened the box , it looked ok, and smelled ok, but as soon as I took a bite I got a mouth full of pre-minced jarred garlic. It came right back out, I figured maybe it was just that bite and took another one to give it another chance. NO WAY the whole pizza was covered in it, not to mention the peppers were not fresh but canned marinated red peppers and the olives as well. I was so disappointed and on top of it the pizza was $21.00, I felt ripped off. Wont go back."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. Order 1 mushroom slice and 12 wings. The pizza tasted awful( sat awhile)
and the wings were hideously small. Worse size wings ever. Where's the damn meat. It was skin and bones.
Then, I asked for easy ice, and he didn't listen. to that neiWorst $17.00 I have ever spent on food."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to eat. I love their pizza and wings. this time I got the lunch special with my son and getting two pizzas and a free soda was awesome. Only spent 5 dollars and change."}
{"text":"Fresh salad, great bread and turkey sandwich.  


But the Spaghetti was 6/10.

They delivered under an hour to the RV park and the driver was friendly. 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for crunchy wings, this is the place to get them! I love how crunchy and drenched in buffalo sauce they are"}
{"text":"Most of the time it's awesome and great but there is some random times I ordered wings and came really over cooked."}
{"text":"I really like Palermos. Prefer the location at 83rd & Lower Buckeye. Not sure if same ownership, but either way, this one is still good for greasy pizza and crispy wings. Nice people too."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because they kept stuffing advertising flyers under my door.  I called in to place the order for pick up.  The woman who answered the phone asked me to hold, and then I could hear her arguing with a customer on another line about an order that had not been delivered for quite some time.  I began to have misgivings, but for $7, decided to hang in there.

She came back on the line, and I placed my order.  She told me it would be ready in 10 minutes.  I gave them an extra 5 minutes, just to be safe, and then went over to pick it up.  

The neighborhood where this Palermos Pizza is located on Twain Ave is not very good.  Not dangerous, mind you, but you just get an unpleasant vibe from it.  There were a group of 4 teenage boys standing in the parking space in front of the restaurant, for instance, idly passing the evening.  

I went into Palermo's Pizza place (basic low-end pizza joint interior; it has about 4 or 5 tables for patrons to eat at, should anyone ever choose to do so), and the woman behind the counter was pleasant and cheerful.  They had just finished my pizza and were cutting it up.  I paid and went home.  The pizza was decent - certainly worth the price I paid.  I would go again."}
{"text":"The slice of pizza is as big as my hand...and the toppings were piled so high, i think it touched my nose when I bit down.  I usually get the Slice Special for $3.50. It has 6 toppings and is just delicious!!!  I've also tried their Spaghetti with Meatballs and I'd say this dish is ...alright.  I would prefer a little more sauce and a little more salt but hey....it comes with a 12-inch garlic loaf...and it's huge and only costs $7.25

The restaurant is quite busy Friday and Saturday nights, expect your to go order to take between 25-25 minutes if you aren't ordering just pizza by the slice.  On a regular day, maybe 20 minutes so I'd really call it in.  Sit down orders are faster than the to go orders even on their busy nights.  The staff is very sweet and nice. 

My goal:  try the wings next time cus ...man they looked GOOD when the other guy took it to his table!"}
{"text":"I hear the owner keeps the tips his employees make. He also doesn't require any of his employees to be vaccinated against HepA. He allows employees to go to work while being ill.  Some of the young women who work there wear very short shorts; unprofessional in any work environment.  

Regarding the food, the pizza is good. Very thin crust but good flavors going on. The wings are fantastic. A little over priced for pizza and wings, but he is in a good location so maybe his rent is high. Or, since he keeps the tips, just a greedy jerk."}
{"text":"For over 10 year all the family Plaermos pizza places have been my favorite! I'm from New Jersey just outside NYC and grew up on thin New York Style pizza. I can say that of all the places I've tried this is the most authentic and delicious. The Sicillian style is also exactly as it's supposed to be.

Appetizers, salads, buffalo wings and beers have also always been good. Alway friendly services"}
{"text":"Just moved nearby was looking for a good pizzeria. This place is great!!
People are super friendly. You can tell the ingredients they work with are fresh and the best quality. The pepperoni pizza was fantastic and sausage and peppers sub was excellent! This will definitely be my go to pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Palermo's pizza and wings is hands-down the best place in town chicken wings are perfect pizza amazing service great they're actually like family very friendly people always make you feel welcome thanks mama thanks papa"}
{"text":"Their wings are pretty good. Usually my wife and I will get pizza from another place and order wings from here. Their pizza in the other hand is pretty gross. Not sure if it's the cheese they use. But the smell, texture and flavor of their pizza is pretty bad. Hope they change their recipe on the pizza to make it better, since reading others reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks that. Another thing I've noticed is the smell of dirty mop inside when picking up my wings."}
{"text":"Awful undercooked.  Got the runs from one piece.  Paid $22 for large crappy pizza that got me sick."}
{"text":"Coming from NY, the pizza isn't the best, but by far the best anywhere around here, there spaghetti is good, their other dishes so far are average I guess, about to try their lasagna. But best Pizza around Buckeye by far!"}
{"text":"This place used to serve good food long time ago now everything is so messed up I'll never leave here again there is no flavor in nothing and up to older guys that work there I just very weird 12 years ago their food was great now they went cheap their food sucks"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since high school (over 10 years).

Not the best pizza ever, but definitely my personal favorite. Lots of toppings, and the wings are delicious.

Their 1 topping pizza with 25 wings was the bargain that me and all my friends have come for all these years"}
{"text":"Just ordered out last night from the place for the first time last night and it won't be the last time. We ordered the special a one topping X-large pizza & 25 wings for $23.95. We were not disappointed. The pizza was big, nice thin NY style crust, we got sausage as our topping and it was delicious! The wings are hands down the best wings I've had from a pizza place. I was pleasantly surprised on both the pizza and the wings. The guy who took our order was extremely nice. There's absolutely nothing I can say wrong about this place."}
{"text":"Honestly had forgotten about Palermo's down the road, but glad a friend of mine reminded she went there recently.  So dinner was had and glad we \"remembered\" this place.  Tasty NY style pizza and we also got some wings to split.  We will certainly not forget about Palermo's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best Pizza and Wings,Amazing Customer Service and the Prices are Great!!! Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza and wings here! Ask for the wings hot and crispy and you won't be disappointed.  Try the specials and take some home too. You'll be back for more...and so will we."}
{"text":"Delivery was a bit on the slow side given proximity, but I'll give them a pass on that one.

I had the White Pizza, a nice classic style. It was decent in that way where you know it's not really any better than the big chain pizza places but it's not really worse either and it just feels better to support local business. No regrets, but it wasn't one of those secret pockets of unrecognized brilliance. Just an alright pizza at a reasonable enough price. Not a bad choice if you need to be up early and don't want the temptation of a long night that starts with a more glamorous dinner. Still, I know what local pizza places can do and this place doesn't quite meet that bar from what I saw. Could be better, could be worse."}
{"text":"The hubby and I ordered the Steak Special sandwich and fries. Not flavorful, tasted like it had been frozen steak strips, the veggies and cheese were not tasty and practically non-existent.  I had high hopes from the other review about this sandwich.  My search continues for a tasty Philly on the Westside."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place one star is because there wasn't an option for zero stars! This place is awful!! I work front desk at a hotel and myself and some coworkers placed an order ,the food that came was cold and not as described on the menu! Not to mention, I also came down with food poisoning ( I had their fettuccine alfredo).  We told them we were removing all their menus from our front desk, and that they weren't allowed to leave menus on our property anymore. Several times we have caught them back on our property shoving menus underneath hotel room doors, it's cause our guests to complain.  This is clearly not a reputable business."}
{"text":"I can't believe how sad and wrong my 'steak special' was... I am currently on the hunt for a great cheese steak in Phoenix. (So far Jersey Mike's on 7th ave south of McDowell is a clear outstanding winner). This place is close to work, so I thought I was going to end up with a great place...No way. 

SERVICE: I'd read so much about the fast service. I don't really care about slow, but it was slower than the bragging that happened here in the reviews. They were quite friendly so that was cool. And I didn't feel rushed to order. 

PRODUCT: The amount of steak on this sandwich was about half of what the bread was capable of! the meat was really dry when I did get any in a bite. It had no flavor, not juiciness... no seasoning and I think a bit of it was over cooked. The cheese tasted like it was aged in a non cheese aged way...I couldn't even tell what kind if was. It was so sad. I was sad! 

I hope other people fair better with the pizza. I watched the cook prepare a pepperoni and it looked sad too...! 

I will not be wasting my money here again. I'd rather go to the Albertsons next door and buy the stuff I need to make a cheese steak at home."}
{"text":"So, to start, let me share that I am a pizza snob... I like Chicago Style but can't seem to find a Chicago Pie place West of... Chicago.  Palermo's is served New York Style, thin and crispy.  At first I wasn't sure, but then when I ordered a sausage/pepperoni pizza, I could not believe what I had just received.  The pizza was ENORMOUS!  and the price of course was fantastic!  When I opened the box however, I was shocked that what I got was in fact a delicious real cheese pizza with fresh pepperoni's and shredded sausage.  That's right.  Shredded sausage. How many times have you seen that done?  Easy to get ground sausage, but let me tell you , shredded sausage is the omega of Delish!!  Anyway, without a doubt, this is my \"Go To\" Pizza anytime I am feigning for Pizza Pie.... You should get some...."}
{"text":"Ben here twice already. Pizza is very good as were the wings. Will try the calzones next time"}
{"text":"Wings are delicious and for a good price. Calzone  delicious. Good amount of food for the price"}
{"text":"Ordered a pie and medium wings from here today for us and some out of town guests that we had. The service was great and very friendly.  The food was hot when we arrived to pick it up.  When we got home and opened it up it looked amazing.  When we bit into it it tasted great.  The wings had just the right amount of spice, and they were cooked perfectly.  The pizza had just the right crisp on the crust.  My guests were really impressed with the food choice.  I personally have always liked the food from here, but today it truly was awesome.  The only flaw that I have with Palermo's is they are a bit pricey.   That is why we do not order from there too often."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Great food for the location. I really enjoyed the calzone with sausage and a few other ingredients. Relaxed environment. When I am hitting up the bustling metropolis that is Buckeye I always eat here."}
{"text":"2nd best pizza int he valley (1st is Piazza al Forno, but it's more expensive.)  I'm a n New Yorker and the pizza here is awesome - thin crust with a curious cheese combination.  Careful..the wings are deadly addicting...watch out!  I would have to say the cherry on top though is the outstanding owner/service: these are the nicest people you'll meet in a pizza joint, and they remember repeat customers.   They always smile, ask if I want a beer, etc.  This is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ehh. 

Wings were small and bland. The pizza was below average. I had to pile on the garlic powder and oregano from the table shakers so there was some flavor. 

I left feeling i wasted my $$ for a crap dinner. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"Palermo's has IMO the best wings for a pizza joint in Buckeye. Their pizza is great, they are always courteous and the prices a great."}
{"text":"I love the pizza but I don't necessarily like how the put a ridge of sauce near the crust but we all like our pizza differently. I highly recommend the sour dough crust I always get it! It is great for parties because the pizzas are big and the slices are a good size for each person and if they are to big you can ask to have someone cut the slices smaller."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Buckeye area I've had this pizza near my work and loved it!!!  And it's just a good here we'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza! Huge slices and extremely thin.. you can fold these in half and eat like a real NY slice!"}
{"text":"I've had there pizza and wings before which has always been great! For a time, my friend wouldn't want to eat any other pizza besides this. I've recently tried their Stromboli and it was delicious. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is like family. The gentlemen here make sure you are taken care of. Foods great. Today was the 1st time trying there subs. Omg I'm hooked. Great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings for a reasonable price.  The owner is always there and always funny."}
{"text":"I've eaten here only two times. First time was delivery, and it took an hour for a greek salad and some hot chicken wings. Second time, I decided to drive there. Bad neighborhood. Crackheads and hookers everywhere. I got BBQ chicken wings, and a Godfather sub. The cold sub was delicious, I'll give them that. But the wings were tiny, and they just plopped the \"BBQ sauce\" on top. The nastiest sauce ever. I never throw away chicken wings, but after 5 wings, I was disgusted."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza and wings in the area. I love cheese pizza and the cheese on theirs is on point. Reminds me of being back on east coast. =]] 

Didn't receive 5 because crust is never crispy enough even when asked for crispy."}
{"text":"Good, best around anyway. Good pizza, wings are a bit small, dinners are satisfying but not great. I would and will go again. I might be harsh being from NY and of Italian heritage but its better than \"fast food pizza\""}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizza! For me it's all about their cheese...like nothing I've ever had. The sauce is just perfect, they dont overdo it. They are always super friendly when my husband and I stop by. They practically know us by now bc we stop by here so often, whether its picking up a whole pizza or grabbing a slice onthego. Their wings are a bit small but delicious. They pack on the buffalo sauce so they are all messy! Mmmm...finger lickin good!"}
{"text":"I hate that my last few reviews have been negative. I am usually pretty good at picking spots that turn out to be good. That said, Palermos Pizza is probably some of the worst I have ever had. I got the two slice and drink special. Just got regular old pepperoni slices. Well, I have had letters from my credit card company that were thicker than this pizza. The dough was pasty, not cooked enough, sauce was barely there, the chesse while there was dripping with grease as was the pepperoni. Even the diet Coke tasted like chlorine. Didn't know how to eat this mess, tried a knife and fork, but everything just slide off to one side, tried folding it, but as soon as I lifted it off the plate it sagged and started to loose cheese and stuff. Finally, used the fork to cut down, which squashed the slice even flatter. I loaded it up with Parm, peppers and oregano, but still there was little taste. I left most of it. Checked the other reviews and some seem to love the place, they must have gone on a day when there was a different cook. Sorry, but I will NEVER go there again.  That letter from my credit card company, with a bit of cheese would probably taste about the same, maybe better if the stamp was tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyro and Greek Salad.  The delivery was within the 35 minute timeframe they quoted me.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is always great here. The owner is so sweet and genuinely wants you to have a great experience. Love this place!! Best pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and so much more

Palermos Pizza is reminiscent of the neighborhood pizzeria you remember visiting after school to grab a slice of pie with a coke, and relax with your friends.

Palermos offers no-frills delicious pizza, served either by the slice, or as a whole pie. Palermos makes their dough fresh daily and splash on a generous portion of homemade sauce then slather your pie with freshest toppings of your choice. This pie is the perfect combination of crispy crust, delicious sauce, and the perfect amount of toppings.

In addition, too delicious pizza, Palermos offers salads, calzones, sandwiches, desserts, wings, pasta, and an assortment of appetizers. So, If you are a pizza fan (and who is not?) You have to visit Palermos you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I tried the eggplant sub and it was fantastic!!  My son tried the hot turkey and cheese sub and he said thàt it was so much better than the other local pizza and sandwich places. The guys who run this place are also really nice and friendly. The price of the sandwiches was very good also. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been coming to Palermo's for over 15 years... this location is definitely not my first choice but the food is still pretty good.  Came in today and found out that the hot wing orders have gone from 25 to 20 or from 50 to 40 while the price stays the same.... wings are average but small, at this price point I'll take my business to Booty's or Native.  For over a dollar per wing after taxes there are plenty of better options."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I will NEVER visit this place again! I ordered sausage in marinara sauce, the sausage tasted expired, disgusting and crumbed in my mouth. The lasagna was old and grey covered in mozzarella cheese. A waste io my money, NEVER AGAIN.

The food is disgusting. Service was ok but I wonder if because they knew their good is gross. My sausage n marinara sauce crumbled in my mouth like it was old, it tasted old and sour. My lasagna was not tasty, the ground beef looked aged, me and my 2 year old had the runs."}
{"text":"I love Palermo's.  I usually go to their location on 67th Ave & Indian School and I'm never disappointed.  My husband and I went to this location yesterday for a couple of slices and a soda and it was really good.  The slices were huge and brought out to us on real plates with real silverware--very rare in a pizza parlor.  The slices could have been slightly hotter but they were delicious!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place! We always get our pizza to go or delivery. We tried the pastas and bread and they were mediocre at best. But the pizza keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the area (I'd be in trouble if they delivered). I've ordered their
pizza, ranch and sandwiches-all have been delicious!! They are always friendly and call me by name. Last time I was in, I was chit-chatting to him about my kayaking trip through the Grand Canyon. Have been coming here for YEARS. It's our family's favorite pizza!"}
{"text":"Best wings and service!!!! We go there after work and they stay open for hours just for us!"}
{"text":"Delightful!  2 pieces of pizza and drink for $4 AND its delicious!  The crust is light and thin, flavors are terrific.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It was sub par.  Expected better after reading these reviews.  I'd rather get Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Vegas every year for business and having a group of 20 to 30 people i always order food for delivery just to be on the efficient side as far as time is concerned. so tried calling morning time to place in an order for 12:30, 10 mins before they were suppose to be here I get a call saying \" we wanted to confirm your order for 2:30\" and this is after checking with them multiple times just to make sure it will be here on time. in conclusion they wanted to deliver it after an hour being late and made us feel like that we said the wrong time. they were not willing to comp us for the mistake that they had made. Instead they were defending the guy that took our order whom repeated our order 5 times and confirmed the time with us for 12;30 also. No professionalism at all. Would not recommend this place to anyone! hope in the future they have better management."}
{"text":"We have a Palermos closer to home which is so-so but after coming to this one, we don't mind making the drive! Each Palermos is independently owned, this one is owned by a sweet family, they all work there and are always polite. They know their regulars by name and always ask how they are doing etc. The pizza and wings are what we usually get, we have been getting the siciliana style pizza lately, it's their deep dish type pizza and I haven't had a better pie than theirs! Crust is crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside, great sauce and cheese and the toppings are plenty. We always bring home a to go box of pizza to enjoy the next morning :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a bit now. I have to say this is the best place to get pizza for the tolleson area and I have been trying other pizza places around my house. So come on down and take part in the great food they serve."}
{"text":"The place has very good wings. I get them extra crispy. Very friendly staff and the lunch specials are golden."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).  Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of \"soggy crust\" comments etc..."}
{"text":"Pizza was very cheesy and delicious, wings were alright, a bit saucy. Overall tasted great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Palermo's is our favorite place to go for pizza and wings. New owners are very nice too! We go there every other Friday evening. Last night we brought s bunch of friends from church and used the meeting room. Everyone had a great time! I hope this place is a success!"}
{"text":"I keep reviewing this place and the review keeps being taken down.  This is one of my family's favorite places for pizza. We come here about every other Friday for pizza and wings...both of which are good. We really enjoy the new owners as they always seem happy and eager to please. I hope Yelp doesn't pull this review down again!"}
{"text":"This place has always been good to me althpugh the only thing I order is there Philly Cheesesteak with mushrooms & cheese , it's the BOMB!"}
{"text":"I simply ordered a $4.99 pick up cheese pizza. Delicious. I love their garlic crust and real cheese. Also, it looks like a family and friends run business."}
{"text":"Just ordered a couple of pizzas delivered through Bite Squad. Very impressed! Nice thin crust, delicious red sauce with the perfect amount of spice, delicious sauce, pizza showed up quickly hot and perfect.  Will def order again!"}
{"text":"23 May 2015: While visiting with my cousin for the holiday weekend, she decided to order from this place because she didn't feel like cooking for three people. I didn't argue because I'm not about to turn down pizza. 

While on the phone with the employee of this establishment, my cousin explicitly told her, repeatedly, that she lives out of their delivery range by a half mile. My cousin made sure that this was ok with them. Said employee put my cousin on hold, so she could ask and make sure this was ok with the powers that be. It was. The wait time was \"55 minutes or more\". Apparently, their policy is a lot less than that. But I'm not sure since I don't live here. 
Some time later, (we didn't keep track, but it was around an hour), the delivery boy shows up with our pepperoni pizza and mild wings. Delivery boy tells my cousin that the owner sends her a message: some nonsense about how this was a courtesy delivery because she lives two miles out of their range. Uh? Wait. My cousin was on the phone for around 20 minutes when placing the order, and made damn sure they delivered to her address. 

When I checked-in, it said that this restaurant is 5.5 miles away. Their delivery range is five miles. Therefore, my cousin lives a half mile out of their way. Of course my cousin let the delivery boy know everything, so he could tell the powers that be. 

The pizza was good. It would've been better had it not been soaking in a pool of lukewarm grease. The wings left a lot to be desired. I'd probably feel different had those been warm. 

I don't think my cousin will be ordering from there any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing establishment! We frequent this place and would recommend it to everyone in the area. Their pizza is one of the best that you will get in Buckeye and everything that I have had here I have enjoyed. If you're ever in the mood for breadsticks or caesar salad, it pairs well with their pizza. To add to this, their employees are well trained and have always been courteous. We also order take-out over the phone quite a bit and our order is spot on each time and never takes more than 20 minutes. Once we even called in to make an adjustment and they were quick to do it with 0 complaints. Overall very pleased and we will continue to be loyal customers to this local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Flavor? Nope.

The pizza was a bit larger than I expected, and that would generally be a good thing, but there was almost no flavor art all.

I am originally from Chicago, and I therefore come with reasonably high standards when it comes to what makes a quality pizza. This place didn't come anywhere near meeting any of them. The sauce was really bland. The sausage was in very small pieces on the pizza, and it had virtually no flavor. The parmesan and Chile flakes were at the counter to be taken to your table, but I didn't notice that they were there until I was done eating.

The service was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Employee's are not the cleanest people. When I was there I saw the guy wipe his nose and then go back to touching the food. Pizza itself is kinda gross. Pizza was too grease, to the point that it soaked through the box. Pizza also has a weird after taste that I could not put my finger on."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Girl behind the counter was extremely friendly, helpful and patient. She even told us about the daily special. 

Food was also great. We had 'Palmero's Specialty' large pizza and 25 hot wings, and 1 large soda. The price was $39. Pizza was delicious as well as their wings, really crispy! Food was ready in about 15 minutes. 

They also deliver, which is an added bonus! 

Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona to visit family and ordered pizza and wings here. The pizza was extremely tough and  felt like the dough was old. It was tough to bite down and hard to get through. The sauce was fine but that dough was hard to bite through without grinding my teeth. The wings were good but I've had better pizza and would try a different place."}
{"text":"So rude!!! I'm visiting my family from out of town and I always loved to have palermos wings when I come to town and I called for delivery at 950 ( keep in mind it's a Saturday night) and they said I'm sorry we can't deliver we close in 10 min..... THOSE ARE STILL BUSINESS HOURS IF YOU ARE OPEN TIL 10... Get your $h:t together Palermos!"}
{"text":"I think the guy I met was either the manager or co owner..I just moved here from San tan and this was the first place we visited. It was pouring down rain and my kids were craving pizza and wings. We had been moving all day and so many things were left in boxes I could not dare cook. I watched this man make everything from scratch and as I was asking him questions he actually answered them with enthusiasm. The food is great but the customer service is incredible. I placed a phone order and was given the wrong food. When I called in and explained the problem the same guy was very apologetic and offered to replace the whole order free. He said the young lady was new so I totally understood. No one is perfect but the fact that he cared so much about how I felt was amazing. I am a lifetime customer!"}
{"text":"I really hate doing this but I have to...
Needed to coordinate a lunch for about 15 people and decided to give a mom and pop pizza joint a shot vs the usual dominos or pizza hut we always get because it's so convenient.

I called a few days in advance and spoke with Danny, the owner I guess, and gave him a tentative order. I also told him I'd call the night before to confirm my order because I wouldn't get a chance the next day and needed it delivered to our hotel at 12:30 sharp.
Unfortunately I was unable to call because I had a lot of stuff going on (I had told him I'm coming to Vegas from LA on business and will be very busy.) However, I called the following morning bright and early at 8am, not expecting for someone to pick up but luckily they did!

This guys name was Alex and I told him I'm calling because I didn't get a chance to call last night, but I spoke w/the owner a few days ago and he said u have 24 inch pizzas....I need 2 of them delivered to my hotel at 12:30 today, can u still please do this???
He said sure, no problem, just call at 11 am when we open and place the order.
I called at exactly 11am, a girl picks up to take my order and then tells me they don't make 24 inch pizzas.I explain to her several times that I had spoken with Danny and Alex and they said u do. 
\"No, 15 is the largest we make\"
I ask to speak with the owner, he's not there...so she hands the phone to Alex. I tell him what happened and he said that the girl who picked up is new...she doesn't know what she's saying. So why would u have her pick up the phone?!?!?!?
I place my order with alex and tell him about 3 times that we need it for 12:30 and give him my friends # to call once they're here so he can hop out and grab it.
It was an absolute disaster!
12:30, no pizza. I call at 12:35 and they say it's on it's way.
12:40, still nothing. I call again and ask them to call the driver to see how far away he is.
Then my friend (who was waiting in the lobby) comes back up and says he just got a call and said our order is for 2:30.
I flip out. I call back and they have no idea what's going on. 
I ask for Danny, he's not there. I ask for Alex and he comes on the phone and tells me I had ordered for 2:30 but he doesn't know who called me.
Mind you, I have 14 hungry people staring at me and there is no way for us to get anything else to eat in 30 minutes before we had to go back to our event.

As I'm arguing with Alex he keeps putting me on hold and I just hear yelling in the background.
At this point I ask my friend to dial the # that called him. Lo and behold it was Danny, I take the phone and Danny basically puts the whole blame on me and tells me that I had said I would call the night before and I didn't. And THENNN he tells me he called me the night before and left me a message. I checked my messages...I had no messages from him. He then told me he did and to check my messages again.
This is beyond ridiculous. What does me not getting a chance to call the night before have anything to do with Alex telling me at 8am AND 11am that they can have it there at 12:30?????
He told me I called a different # than the one I originally dialed from a few days ago I ONLY HAVE ONE NUMBER FOR PALERMOS! 
Danny was very rude to me, blamed their screw up on me, told me to leave Alex out of this...his exact words \"Alex is a great guy\"
and then asked so do you want the pizza or not?!?
When I told him I wouldn't pay full price for all the inconvenience he told me he's not going to give me a discount. I told him that before I called the first time I saw that u guys had some bad reviews, but I always support local businesses so decided to give u guys a shot. PLEASE don't make me go on yelp and give u guys another bad review.
He didn't care.

So, in conclusion, I never tried the pizza, horrible customer service, horrible employees who don't even know what's on the menu.
They screw up an order, don't apologize for it, blame it all on me..are totally rude about it AND refuse to give me a discount.

Unbelievable. Please stay away from this place because you'll go out of your mind dealing with people who clearly don't know how to run a business."}
{"text":"Palermos brings a great rendition of a New York style pizzeria. It is a family owned business and they are such sweet people, always welcoming with a smile. This is the number one place for pizza and wings. The wings are so crisp & empowering with flavor, gosh it's the best! The entire recipe for the pizza is homemade, the crust is so fresh, with a light crisp. It is a bit pricy but most definitely worth every penny! The portions are huge and fulfilling. Palermos will not fail you when you're craving pizza, wings & friendly service! I am obsessed with this eatery!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza and wing's in Arizona i loveee all their food excellent customer service very clean i go every week and eat some yummy pizza thats made with home made dough sauce made from scratch and the best quality cheese their is !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sicilian special.  Worst I ever ate.  Majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough.  Something tasted stale on the toppings.  Disgusting!!!  This place was actually recommended. Lol what a joke!"}
{"text":"Got the pepperoni pizza and it was super good, the bread twists were really good too. The delivery driver said they were short handed, but they still got there in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza-kind of New Yorkish with the this crust and lots of cheese.  Pricey though."}
{"text":"I love that there is a Palermo's less then 5 mins from my house! We still order it to be delivered once in a while when we are just too exhausted to leave the house. My favorite pizza topping is sliced tomatoes. Palermo's is the only pizza place that slices fresh whole tomatoes for my pizza. Fresh tomatoes makes such a huge difference, it is delicious. They're crust is thin and easy to bite/chew, but still sturdy enough to not fall and drop all the toppings. I like that they offer oregano along with parmesan for your pizza. We always order either the pizza and wings special or 2 cheese pizza special. You can't go wrong with 2 XL cheese pizzas for $24, it's such a steal. They do offer pastas, and a few other dishes, but I've never tried them. We go just for the pizza and wings and we're never disappointed."}
{"text":"We picked up a large 1 topping for carry out $15. The pizza is thin crust, ample, and very tasty. They had our pie ready 10 min after we called. It's nothing fancy but I didn't have to cook and it pairs well with my 2 buck chuck."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place and I was very impressed!!! Pizza was amazing chicken wings were awesome, ice cold draft beer  they even had wine for my wife !!! My kids had a ball playing video games while me and the wife enjoyed some football on there big flat screen TVs, awesome place will definitely go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza ever.  I'm disgusted and can't believe the good reviews.  This place has dirty cooks,  horrible pizza sauce and the rudest service ever.  Soggy pizza and I would never eat here again.  Flys everywhere and just plain gross.  Stay away"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly! Came in for lunch and they had so many lunch specials for amazing prices ! The pizza is delicious and so are the wings! Definitely my new favorite pizza spot !"}
{"text":"Literally the worst pizza I have ever had, the wings are mediocre and not at all hot! I only came here because a friend of mine begged me to give it a try, I guess I won't be taking her word for good food anymore, if you want good pizza and good wings and a place that doesn't look like a dump, go check out Barros Pizza!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I ever had ice tastes like sewer. I ordered a sub the meat was old and bread was stale. Service sucked don't it here unless you want a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Had the choice between the pizza here or a $5 dollar one from a chain, decided to give Palermos a try. Wrong choice! The price to quality ratio was just completely off. You really do not get what you're paying for, but hey the kids loved it so what the hell. Will try it again, but will not stray away too far from the pizza. The first thing that I noticed was that the pizza was very greasy. Greasy pizza, which is no problem if combined with pizza that has flavor, but the flavor here was completely lacking and greasy pizza without the flavor is no good. I kept eating just to see if it would improve. It did not. Like I said, I will try it again, so don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Best pizza south of the I-10. I've always loved a good Sicilian pizza and here they don't disappoint! Big, fluffy and really fresh! It easily beats any of the other pizza chains around the area! Really friendly and I'm so happy that I found a great spot so close by!"}
{"text":"Crust is chewy.  Pizza is below-average.  Nice owner though."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Owner works the counter and is incredibly nice. Food is great. I will stop by this hole in the wall pizza place every time I come through Buckeye."}
{"text":"I wanted hot, delicious lasagna to go. I feel bad that it was so cheap. I got hot, delicious lasagna plus a loaf of warm, pillowy Italian bread. I would go back anytime. Nice people. Clean restaurant. Good good for great prices."}
{"text":"This is a decent place. Pizza isn't amazing, but is better than average. They have good wings with a nice vinegar based sauce that are fried well. I don't mind going here now and then, but do wish their beer selection was better. Usually one or two domestic options only with no flavor. Please bring some micro brew options in like all your competitors do and it would be much better to sit down and eat for a bit!"}
{"text":"Good little Italian place. Lots to choose from & they deliver - we don't have a lot of Italian here so -- we like Palermos - good sauce , garlic & tomato - yeah"}
{"text":"This is not the Italian Food you're looking for.... 

OK, this place has gone seriously downhill with the new management, and the food was bad enough to make Marco Polo weep. 

Let's start with the good.... The place is big, the staff was friendly, the bar area was pretty nice, and they had a lot of TV's playing the Cardinal's game. I could totally buy this place as a sports bar. 

Now, on to everything else.... 

The parking situation is abysmal, but hey, that's Avondale for ya... I won't blame this restaurant for the shrieking baby, that blame goes squarely on the shoulder of the parents who were busy getting their drank on. 

We ordered: 
Apps: Onion Rings / Friend Mushrooms / Moz Sticks
Entree: Steak & Cheese sandwich, the \"special\" calzone, and the lasagna. 
Well, we didn't order the lasagna at first, of the 10 things listed in the pasta section it was the only thing available that wasn't spaghetti and meatballs. 
$50.00 for the check, this included drinks & a mediocre tip. 

The appetizers came to the table, and as soon as I saw the fried mushrooms I had a bad feeling. 

Everything was perfectly shaped and colored. This is because everything certainly came out of a freezer bag 5 minutes ago. The moz sticks were flavorless, the onion rings were perfectly round onion flavored bread rings, and the fried mushrooms were an undercooked disaster of batter, covering the world's smallest mushrooms. 

I'm not a super Italian food enthusiast, the kind that expects it to taste like it came from a Tuscan village. I just wanted something that tasted less like fried batter, and more like FOOD. 

My wife said the Steak & Cheese was OK. The meat and cheese components were tasty enough, but the previously frozen roll was undercooked and doughy. 

The lasagna was rough, Stouffer's® puts out a similar product in the frozen food section of Fry's, so save yourself some money and try that if you want, because this was just not good. No seasoning, bland cheese mix, and straight from the jar sauce that was almost too sweet. 

The calzone, the Palermo's Special Calzone, was sadly also from frozen, and I can't let it go! (see what I did there?) It was perfectly shaped, and the outside was crispy, however, like all frozen entrees of this caliber, it was a soggy nightmare on the bottom. Inside it was watery and nasty. No taste, horrible \"cheese\" filling, and the same disgusting sauce that the lasagna was made with. No Bueno. 

The waitstaff was nice, if not a little absent after food delivery, but the food was abysmal. I'm a fat guy who loves to eat, and this had me rethinking everything.

I can tell you that #1 Brothers is right down the road, if you want a better Italian ANYTHING, go there, cause damn."}
{"text":"Not very good at all wish I would have read the reviews..ordered chicken wings and a pizza ...chicken wings were anorexic and the pizza wasn't all that . Not ordering here again"}
{"text":"Wife enjoyed their Hoagie and thought it was a better choice than going to Subway. I had their Calzone special and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Tried Palermos for the first time the other night. We ordered a 16\" pizza with half cheese, half meatball. Also asked for french fries, but the guy said they didn't have them yet... the menus were just recently printed. So that was disappointing. We got mozzarella sticks instead. The cheese sticks were tastier than I expected. They had a nice breading and the cheese was melty and good. The pizza was also good, although I don't think I would do meatball again. It was very thinly sliced and had an interesting flavor so it took on a whole different taste compared to the plain cheese. I liked the crust. Crisp on the very bottom so it wasn't limp, yet the dough was still soft (not cardboard-y). Lots of cheese. I definitely overdosed on cheese. The guy at the counter had a thick accent and was a little hard to understand, but he was nice and friendly. I would get pizza here again."}
{"text":"Meatball sub and garlic knots are very good, pizza is ok.  My biggest gripe is that the restaurant always smells like a sewer.  Either the people there don't notice it anymore, or they don't care.  What little decor exists feels sparse and out-of-date, primitive like a school or hospital cafeteria.  With a little work, this could be a better place."}
{"text":"Average Good and Cheap.

What can I say the food was good.  The service was good.  

Pizza hot and crisp crust.  Wings were hot and not over fried.  Price was right. 

Perfect for a school sports pizza outing, watching the game or family night."}
{"text":"Food is just as remembered,  good but not great. The girl behind the counter was borderline rude. Obviously wanted to be someplace else. If my wife wasn't a fan of this place i wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Although the food wasn't bad we won't be going back. Customer service was great but I asked for a sub with extra mayo and came home with no mayo. Growing up right outside of philly I expect a lot from a pizza place that makes subs. This just wasn't up to par and you don't get a lot for what you pay. If you need something quick it's a go to place but I'll just keep going to firehouse subs unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the location was very clean and we got helped fast. The cashier was very friendly and told us about the specials they had. The whole staff was realli friendly and welcoming. The food came out fast and was fresh. Would return again and recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I can't give zero. Shame on me for not recognizing that the same man who acknowledged a non-working sink, and then handled money without gloves, and then made my sandwich, may be a bit unsanitary. Two days later=still barfing and other indescribables. Calling county health department tomorrow. :("}
{"text":"The staff is so caring and always makes sure you are completely satisfied. 
Very nice people! And the menu is great! Delicious food!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We started going to this restaurant when we moved to Buckeye 3 years ago, love it! The food is excellent and the owner is very nice and charming. We stop in whenever we are in Avondale, and sometimes make the drive from Buckeye just to get their pizza and wings."}
{"text":"First we have been getting pizza and wings from here for years. Always good and good service. 
Tonight we ordered a large supreme and after getting it home and eating over half with the family we discovered a cricket on the pizza. 
We called them and returned the evidence. Very apologetic and returned our money. 
Hopefully this does not happen to anyone else and they clean the place up. 
Will be looking elsewhere for our pizza."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.... Is usually what comes to mind with the pizza, However this statement contradicts itself after tasting the pizza and having to pay for refills on soda. The prices were a bit high for pizza and small size wings. Not that it isn't bad but just not great. If your stomach is empty and need to fill space this will satisfy just don't expect a cacophony of flavors. 
So here comes the frustrating part, my family decide to have a little celebration at the place and had a cake they asked to store until the time was right to sing birthday wishes. Upon receiving the cake there was a bug in the cake that who knows where it came from. None the less the party went on. 
On a side note..they should smile more when they are behind the counter. They stand their like bouncers hovering over the customers."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or dinner. Their afternoon lunch specials are nice, 2 slices and a drink for like $4. Can't beat it. Calzones are bomb.com"}
{"text":"Just moved to Buckeye and we are very particular about our pizza we order pizza and wings to go and it was delicious pizza slices are huge and wings are great definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. What more could abguy ask for? Come and eat, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I've gone a few times, ordered something different each time, hoping that something stood out as good. No such luck.
Lasagna, manicotti, and of course pizza. Nothing was that good."}
{"text":"Ayyyeee boss is the greeting when you walk in. Wings are great pizza us made for you as you walk in ill make this place a continuous stop thru out the month"}
{"text":"Got my this ziti with mozzarella , ricotta (ricotta was left out ) dont know why and tomato sauce , first time got pasta from here took it to go went home and was very upset , I grew up in Europe and know very well how this dish suppose to look like one thing for sure this is a lazy dish made without flavor tomatoes sauce straight out of the can and the cheese was jus slices of cheap mozzarella out of package probably ,not to mention this is an Italian eatery ..the pizza I got was good but pasta NOT , I paid about $8 for something I could have made better !"}
{"text":"Friendly service on the phone and for the quick pick up, and the pizza was ready when specified.  Aroma wasn't terribly appealing on the way home and I think it's the canned mushrooms that were on the pizza.  Anyway, the cheese & sauce were fine, and the crust had a nice thin chewy middle while perfectly crisp on the exterior.  Down at the end of the slice it was more of the same, almost like a chewy french bread middle with crispy outer crust.  As already mentioned, I wish the mushrooms were more of the HQ stuff that are hand cut.  Sure I didn't see them open a can of mushrooms, but they sure looked and smelled like them.

Prices are reasonable.  Medium pizza is really what I could consider a large, and barely fit the box in which it was enclosed.  Mozz sticks seemed like the frozen and fried kind."}
{"text":"First time trying this place after moving from Phoenix to Buckeye. Ordered a take out of a medium 3 topping pizza and breaded zucchini.  The pizza was a sloppy mess with the consistently of a wet paper towel.  Had to eat it with a fork.  The zucchini was cooked to within one shade of burnt.  Don't know if this was a fluke or not. Won't be going back anytime soon. My quest for good pizza in Buckeye continues."}
{"text":"So my fiancé and I heard a lot of good things about this place, so we decided to give it a try. We placed an order for pick up, and when we got there, the guy behind the counter had his head phones in and was pretty rude, like he didn't want to be bothered. 

So we got our food, we both ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwiches were not good at all. The chicken was sliced, grilled, and tasted like it was microwaved. The best part of the sandwich was the cheese. 

All in all, we were really disappointed and will not return. Big let down!"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero star I would. When I got home from picking up my pizza I noticed that what I had ordered was not what I had picked up. I called back to see if there had been a mix up and the man on the phone could BARELY speak English so I was having a tough time understanding him and when I told him that my order was wrong he INSISTED that it was right even tho clearly the pizza in front of me was NOT RIGHT. he was very rude about it and I was so frustrated that I hung up and didn't go back just to avoid seeing him. Don't go here unless you want to get an order you didn't want and be told that you ordered it. Assholes."}
{"text":"This is a nice family owned restaurant. I can only speak on the pizza and winds but they are delicious!"}
