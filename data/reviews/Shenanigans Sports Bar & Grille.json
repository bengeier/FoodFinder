{"text":"This place is awful.  It is run by lazy high school kids.  Take out is a complete joke.  Cold food and the lazy kids make you stand at the counter for 30 minutes to get your food."}
{"text":"This place had so much potential when it opened six months ago. But the servers are so incompetent and the menu and chefs keep changing. The quality of food is really hit or miss, our last three visits were disasters. Expensive disasters. That's why people need to know-- if you come to Arena -- expect high prices and decent/poor food. Good luck. We won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the place.  As most folks from Irwin know, there aren't many places to eat locally without having to drive 20 minutes in either direction.  Needless to say, I was thrilled to hear that a sports bar was coming to the area.

My husband and I tried Arena Sports Grill twice--once during the first week of the grand opening, and another a few months later.  I attributed the first mediocre experience to \"growing pains,\" but was hoping for a better experience the second time.  Boy, was I disappointed.

Everything we ordered (both times) tasted frozen.  The \"Maz\"eroski sandwich was advertised to come with melted provolone, but instead came with cole slaw, tomatoes, and here's the kicker--NO cheese!  When I asked the server if she could have the cook add cheese to the sandwich as advertised, she seemed very confused.  When it came out the second time (with cheese), I didn't make it more than a few bites before I had to stop eating because I kept biting into hunks of fat.  Luckily, the homemade chips were edible, so I munched on those instead.  As others said, this sandwich is comparable to a Steak-umm.  Wish I would have seen the other reviews before ordering this.

Other things we ordered: 
Microbrew Cheese Dip - I understand that pretzels are typically frozen and then re-baked, but some were so hard that they could not be bitten into, and others were wet and soggy.  I would prefer Softstix pretzel bites from the grocery store.
Wings - Just okay.  Not the worst wings I've ever had, but not the best, either.  I'll stick to Dino's if I'm in the mood for wings.
Chicken Parmesan - Mushy and soggy.  May have been better if a crustier bread was used.

I really wanted to like this place.  Most of my favorite restaurants are sports bars, and having one so close to home would have been very convenient.  They have the right idea, but need to buy better quality food.  I would try eating here again if I heard of a change of management or something, but won't be going back otherwise."}
{"text":"First time going and will definitely be the last. First thing was water glass had many brown things floating, 2nd glass the same. Should have left then. Ordered a pasta n pretzel bites. Took almost an hour. BOTH overcooked. How do you screw up pasta like that?The angel hair was mush. The pretzel bites were hard as a rock n the cheese sauce was burnt n cold...ughh  I can see if they were busy, they weren't, service was poor. Didn't come back to check on us. Will never recommend ever."}
{"text":"If you like flat Pepsi (without being offered refills) and pizza that is burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside served to you on a scraped up brown PLASTIC cafeteria tray that is warped then this is the place for you. Also if 14 marble sized hot pepper cheese balls that come without anything to dip them in for $7 is your thing, then Bon Appetite! How is this place still in business? Who in the hell serves hot pizza on a PLASTIC cafeteria tray? Quite obvious who wrote the first two reviews."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Jioio's restaraunt and nearly cried when I found out they closed because their food was so amazing! Not even a couple months after closing did the \"Arena Sports Grill\" open in their place. I am a fan of pub/sport style bars with the classics like chicken wings so I thought I would give this place a go. Today I was finally hungry for one and wanted to try something new, so I went in for a dinner here by myself to give it an honest try.
I tried one of their bigger dishes, the chicken marsala and I got some wings to take home for my family. To be honest, I had a terrible experience at this restaurant and I would not recommend it. I'll try to keep it short and simple:
1) The seating here sucks. The booths are extremely uncomfortable (especially if you have back problems) and I actually had a backache after having to hunch over my table for 30+ minutes. You could sit at a table/chair but shouldn't all the seating be comfortable? Also like another review said, there are flies in here. 
2) The chicken marsala, although it was tender and the sauce was good, it was sub par. Unlike other restaurants who serve it to you nice with maybe a bed of pasta, cut up vegetables or something, they just give you the two pieces of chicken for $14 bucks. Overall taste/quality it would be on the bottom of my list compared to other chicken marsala dinners I've had including ones from chain restaurants. 
3) The meal came with sides. There are hardly any sides to pick from. I picked a baked potato and pasta. The potato was alright but the THE SPAGHETTI SUCKS. This place has the WORST excuse for spaghetti I have ever tasted in my life. It was awful. What a sad replacement for what once was a great Italian restaurant. 
4) The wings. I ordered the garlic parmesean wings. Although the wings were cooked alright, they were mediocre at best and literally had no sauce on them. It looked as if they put the glaze and no parmsean garlic seasoning on them at all. I mean it was pretty pathetic very disappointing. Don't offer different seasonings/flavors if you're hardly going to put any. A five year old can coat those wings better.

I paid around $32 total (including tip) and it felt like I got a $15 meal. And I am usually a generous tipper (and left a decent tip) but I think the service could use improvement and it's the first time I've ever felt like giving a lower tip than usual. Service, the staff are friendly but they could have been better. Not very attentive with tables. The food also took kind of long. I must have had three different people visit my table as well, two not my waitress (the cooks I guess?). I'm not sure what this restaurant is trying to do. It feels like they are trying to make it a more casual run-and-go restaurant but then they confuse you and the pricing/style of their food they shouldn't lose the traditional restaurant experience. 
I'm not sure how the bar is but I wouldn't go back. I'm not really interested in trying any of their other foods here. The atmosphere is nice. It has flat screen TVs and things, but I don't care for that. I go for the food and the food was mediocre. This place isn't quiet \"Kitchen Nightmare\", but there is a tremendous amount of room for improvement. 1/5, would not recommend, would not go back. I want Jioio's back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food for a sports bar. Food is pretty good for a bar as well. This is a regular spot for my wife and I. Price is a little high but acceptable for the proximity to our house and menu selection."}
{"text":"Food was great. We had the pizza, wings and pulled pork nachos(they smoke their meats in house) service was excellent the waitress was very helpful since this was our first visit. We will stop by again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible.  Their pizza always comes in the box as a huge mess.  Most of the time, the cheese is no longer on the dough.  Called to order, was put on hold for 20 minutes and 37 seconds.  I will never eat here again.  Stay away, unless you want to eat garbage pizza."}
{"text":"A one star rating is appropriate for the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the surroundings.  I had eaten at the Arena a few time before and was never impressed with the food, yesterday however was beyond anything I had seen in the past.  My wife and I felt like a big fish sandwich for a late lunch 1:30 pm on a Friday.  When we arrived the waiter immediately mentioned to us how happy he was to see us as we were the first customers to stop since they opened at 11:00 am.  We both ordered the Big Fish sandwich and it was just awful.  Honestly I think it must have been in their freezer since lent maybe even lent 2016, it was dried out and tasteless and than to top it off the grease was old so even the fries has a bad taste to them as well.  We didn't have the heart to complain because they were hurting so badly for customers.  Now we understand why, clearly the standards for quality food service are simply not there and this is quite evident in their food, the lack of customers and the over all cleanliness of the restaurant.  If things are not turned around rather quickly the Arena Bar will go the way of Joio's very soon and that's sad as our town really needs more good restaurants."}
{"text":"My review is based solely upon their takeout service and it is absolutely awful.   I've never been there and waited less than at least
10 minute for takeout.  I paid $20 for a large pizza and ended up throwing most of it away. The pizza was completely undercooked and bland.  I'm done ordering from them."}
{"text":"I was skeptical based on other reviews, but I am definitely glad that I gave this place a chance. We had a party of 16 and had no issues with service. Our waitress, Katie, handled us very well, which I know we can be a bit overwhelming.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the appetizers we shared. 

I personally had the Cajun Chicken Alfredo and it was delicious. It has a bit of a kick, but if you like spicy food, you're good to go.  

They have a few craft beers on tap, so that's always a plus.  I could definitely see myself coming here for Pens or Steeler games."}
{"text":"I go here on a semi-regular basis.   I usually order the wings.  They were s good as usual today.  The kids meals were great.   I have both their pizza and burgers which were fine.   My only kick on Arena is that the restaurant area needs a really good cleaning.  Pick up the carpet and get out a mop nightly and i'll be back to add a star.  The furniture which is left over from Joios is starting to show its age.   I know table and chairs for a restaurant can be expensive.  But it just might get folks in the door.   They have a nice buffet for lunch"}
{"text":"The service sucked pizza was over cooked and stuff was rude as well as didn't pay focus on the other customer. Will not go back. Bartender brought a burn pizza to our table and said we have another one cooking for you. Really"}
{"text":"Ok I hated jioio's this place is nothing like it. They added full bar with about 20 on tap. Food was amazing.we both had pasta dishes. Excellent. Now they have \"smoked ribs \" and if u know my page I do ribs everywhere that has a smoker. Don't think they smoke in house. So guessing store presmoked. But we'll see next time I'll try and post. Found my new NHT bar to go to."}
{"text":"Wow got the buffet today it's called super but there is nothing on it.. One pizza soup was gone really bad.. Something is really wrong here.."}
{"text":"Great food! I haven't had anything here that I haven't liked. I usually end up with pizza but I've had the pork nachos too and they were extreme. Great place to come if you're hungry. TV's are a little overpowering if you try to have a conversation though so keep that in mind. Overall I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.  the first time we had sandwiches which were good.  This time we had pizza.  The pepperoni was so thin, it had no taste at all.  Cheese was also skimpy.  It was average pizza in an area with high pizza standards.  They don't have chilled glasses for beer, most good bars have chilled glasses."}
{"text":"Totally disappointing. The place was dirty, took forever to get our food and when it came the wings tasted like old grease and the chicken sandwiches were over cooked.  We were sent mozzarella sticks instead of hot cheeseballs. The booth was busted my son and husband had to fix the seat in order to sit.  The menus were paper flyers.  Hope our waitress took our advice to find a new job (none of this was her fault). It was clear the bar is keeping them open.  Good luck Dave...."}
{"text":"Saturday night happy hour is 10 to 12. Great app and drink prices. Our bartender Taylor was great,  made good suggestions and her service was excellent. It was our third time there and past visits were enjoyable as well.  We plan on returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered a small 4 cut pizza remembering Joio's from a few years back, the bartender said it was the same kind which I liked .  I actually felt bad for her when she brought it out. It was awful. I cant even explain it. The crust was sopping with some kind of sweet oil, Joios had a sweet sauce but the crust was good and not drenched in oil?? . I ate 1 piece and couldn't finish anymore . I'm not one to bitch about food and just took it on the chin. There was no one in the place @ Dinner Time on a Sunday ."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday with 11 of my friends. We wanted to watch the second half of the Steelers game. Staff was really friendly and the beer was cold. The problem was the food, boneless wings burnt, hamburgers dry and not served as ordered. The onion rings with a $1.00 up charge not worth it. It just seemed like the kitchen was not ready for food ordered of the menu. They had a pizza buffet set up that others in the restaurant were taking advantage of. Long story made short none of us will go back."}
{"text":"Meh. The service here is pretty spotty. Our waitress seemed like she was on another planet at times. Drinks were forgotten, sauces were missed, the Franks hot sauce wasn't brought to me \"because it was too gross\", and she forgot to put our pizza order in until the rest of our food came out.

As for the food, it was ok at best. I ordered their knock off primanti's sandwich. I specifically asked if the steak was actual steak or steakumm (the menu had philly ribeye steak and steak strips listed as meat options). I was told it was steak. Sure enough it was steakumms when it came out. I made it clear that I did not want steakumms, but service was so sketchy at this point, that I didn't bother complaining. Also, I tried ordering it was an egg, since the menu said I could add one for 99 cents; however, the waitress said they are no longer able to offer eggs on the sandwiches...it's right there on the menu! Are there no eggs in the kitchen? The sandwich was not that good. The bottom bun was soggy, the fries are hand cut and decent, the steakumms was gross, and the coleslaw is wrong. My wife ordered a steak hoagie with many of the same problems...soggy bun and steakumms.

Moving on, for being a sports bar, there are not many tvs in the non-bar area. They didn't even put the hockey game on near us, instead we had to watch tennis... the bathroom did not have soap. I'll not be going back here."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to even consider giving this place a try based on posted  reviews  and from other people's encounters I have heard about.

I wanted to watch the hockey game so my thoughts were that this place will probably be  less crowded which would guarantee a place to sit .  Turns out, not so.  We did manage to get a seat but once the game started the area surrounding the bar became 2 fold with people milling around behind us.  This place was alive and well on a Pens Friday game night.  The other option was to sit in the dining area to watch the game but it definitely lacked the excitement the bar area was offering.

The other thing I wasn't expecting about Arena Sports is their extensive menu.  15 appetizers, including hand-cut and breaded onion rings,  Smoked Pulled Pork Nachos (the menu states smoked daily) French Fry Melt that claims to be better than Kennywood (fries have bacon, melted cheese, green onions and a zesty ranch dipping sauce!)  They also have a large selection of soups and salads, burgers, wings, chicken, steak, and seafood entrees, pizza, wraps, subs, grand slam-wiches,  Build Your Own Pasta dishes,  and their smoked in-house ribs and pulled pork.  The grand slam-wiches feature The \"Maz\"eroski, Cutches' Open Face Steak , The Clemente and many more fun options.

The service was quite good and fast paced.  The barmaids proved to be quite skilled with such a large demanding crowd.

Turns out Arena Sports has just added a new member to their fan base.  My first experience here turned out to be a hit!"}
{"text":"I was looking to have a great experience when I visited the restaurant since they said administration was under some experienced manager and so. 
If you look for a hamburger, or snack bar kind of food this is a good choice. 
I was looking also to find good salads and healthier options but they have limited selection and the salad I ordered was bad. 
Lettuce was not fresh and crispy salmon was just ok. Ambiance is just not that great 
Just as it was with joios"}
{"text":"My experience here is good when we order food and pick it up (mostly the jioio's pizza that is sweet), but when we go into the restaurant to dine the experience is horrible due to the time it takes for the food to arrive. It usually takes about 30 minutes, and the same goes for picking up food. I give a decent review still because we love their pizza so much. I am so glad they kept the recipe from the previous restaurant (jioio's). We always order that type of pizza because of the flaky crust, thin dough, and overall sweetness to the pizza. If they could improve their time it takes to make the food I would give it two more stars!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's hit or miss. Generally, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating. I've never had an issue, although I wouldn't say that the food stands out in any particular way. However, it's a good place if you're in the mood for pizza, apps, burgers, etc. If you're looking for 'healthier' options, all they have are salads, which are a little pricey. They do have a decent bar area and open space in the middle of the restaurant. Decent place to come and watch a game, especially with a larger group. They generally have specials during Steelers games and a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"5 stars for the \"old world pizza\"  BEST PIZZA EVER its a sweet pizza which I like.  I gave it 3 stars because everything else to this restaurant isn't good.  Prices are over priced.  $19 for a large pizza with one topping and typically will only feed 2 adults.  Gone for their buffet, its cheap but nothing to it. As long as they have the old world pizza I will keep doing business with them."}
{"text":"No to slow service and it was a very busy lunch rush too. Disappointed in the lack of follow through for coffee. the basics people. The food was meh at best. Wings, overpriced and frankly nothing truly spectacular. The burgers were...well, meh again. Wont be back. That was the 2nd time, first time was a year before, sadly it hasn't changed."}
{"text":"The service was awful.  We had to wait over 5 minutes for someone to seat us when there was only one other table in the restaurant. The food made my boyfriend and I both extremely sick almost right after eating it.  We were both sick for hours."}
{"text":"Actually had heard mixed reviews, but have been in twice with groups of friends most recently during Pen's  playoff game over weekend.  Good service despite a decent crowd.  Reasonably priced food and drinks. Salads very good, zucchini yum! Open-faced steak sandwich was great, although the lettuce and tomato were unnecessary. A pleasant surprise. We'll be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is everything our group ordered was disgusting. Maybe the colleges kids can live with it because it's cheap, but the consensus of our table was yuck. Chili was bland and greasy. Nachos were the plainest I've ever had in my life and most we're soggy from too much cheese. BBQ Cheddar sandwich was doused in so much sauce and it all fell out of the stale bun with one bite. Not to mention it was barely warm. Chicken parm sub - gross. Only thing that was okay was the fried zucchini and you thankfully can't mess that up. Waitresses were nice but I'm not here to suggest servers now am I?"}
