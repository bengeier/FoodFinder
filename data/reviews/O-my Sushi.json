{"text":"Went shopping and found this great sushi place that has all you can eat! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and got to choose our own seating. For 25 dollars the sushi was good and I would say they have the friendliest service, for sure we will be back."}
{"text":"The Kiss of Fire and Who's Your Daddy rolls are spicy deliciousness. All you can eat here is totally worth it with quick service. The menu is extensive with a good range of rolls. Including the garlic edamame."}
{"text":"I wish I have an option for no star at all. Quality as all u can eat was OK but they intentionally served way too slowly. Sushi was very thin and too much rice. One order took 30min to get. Total dining time was hour and a half but I waited more than half of the time. They never apologized. I recommend to find other place."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint, the sushi is delicious... The waitresses are very friendly and effecient, the food was made fresh and quick recommend this place amazing!"}
{"text":"Every item I've ate here tasted very good. I have been to this restaurant 3 times. The service is incredibly slow always. Last time there was only 2 other tables taken and service still was average 10 min per roll. They clearly take their time and it shows in quality but I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have a lot of time on your hands and I can't imagine the wait when they have a busy night with a lot of customers"}
{"text":"O My sushi is adorable. Great local place. Older but kept up. Sushi is good and you can't beat the all you can eat prices. Definitely a good locals spot :) Donna is the best! Very hospitable and kind."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have enjoyed it. The people are friendly, the service is quick. The all you can eat portion sizes are perfect. You can sample a variety of rolls appetizers, etc. my favorite roll is the O.M.G roll. The spice and acidity of the roll was in perfect combination with the sweet and savory flavor. Cute atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service ever. Not even exaggerating, I've been here 2 two times both busy and slow and it has taken 2 hrs just to get like 4 rolls of sushi. Then they want to give you attitude that you're getting frustrated. The food is good but not the wait. Save yourself the time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been coming here for two years. Amazing food and amazing sushi!!!!!!! We come every three weeks at least. The service here is great."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE in Summerlin.  The variety of rolls and quality of sushi is amazing.  Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Food is decent. Service was very slow. Not sure if that's due to being short handed or what. I think they're rating is cushioned a little because they offer some free beer or sake for a good review."}
{"text":"Two reasons NOT to go here: The food and the service.  It should have been a glaring sign when an AYCE sushi place in a great location is pretty empty on a Friday night at 8pm.  First, let's discuss the food.  It is like you take the neglected California Roll from a local's casino buffet and pour twelve sauces on it to hide the quality of anything that would need to be fresh.    Their special rolls are all just cold tempura-ed matter drowned in bland sauces.  Seriously, the crap I attempted to eat here tonight wouldn't pass in a rural town in the Midwest and should definitely not be tolerated in any part of Las Vegas.  Next the service:  Three sushi chefs and two servers (one being the manager/owner?) were completely overwhelmed by four tables.  The waitress (who the Manager declared to us was brand new) struggled mightily to speak English and got 60% of order right within 5 minutes of ordering (3 out of 5 items) and then literally went on break for the next 30 minutes and we were abandoned...  When I got out of the seat and explained this to the other server (Manager), she said \"she will be back soon\" instead of offering to take our next round of items.  At this point me and my girlfriend decided to chalk it up as a bad meal, demanded the check, paid $55 for our mistake, and went to another restaurant down the street to start from scratch.  Read my other reviews, I am not unreasonable.  I just don't think anyone should throw away their hard earned money on this awful restaurant."}
{"text":"The service very slow waitress is rude never came back, and the sushi is 98% ricen 2% fish"}
{"text":"I have gone here numerous times for Saturday AYCE lunch with the family. Service has gotten atrocious. Today we were served cold tempura, had orders come out one at a time to each person. The portions are very small. We didn't even get everything we ordered. At one point we were tempted to go to the Wendy's next door since the food arrived so slowly. There were 6 patrons in the place at the time. It seems like they deliberately slowed AYCE orders, even though they charge $22 for lunch. Many of the rolls are covered in a sticky sweet tempura sauce. One sushi roll was ice cold as if it had been in a refrigerator.  Better alternatives a mile north on Rampart."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is a nice little place in a strip mall. Not a super fancy place but a nice family owned shop. Good for a quick sushi craving.  When you walk in you are greeted in Japanese and warmly welcomed. They do have the 24.95 AYCE. But you better finish or you have to pay for the leftovers!  I got the ultra tuna roll. Spicy inside with plain tuna on top. Hum. Kinda like me!  Also the roll rice is nice too. Thought it was a roll but it was a mini mountain of rice goodness!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice people, friendly service. Fresh food, Clean place and a decent price. Sit in or pick up. Very close to shopping of you need to run errands."}
{"text":"Upon entering you see that this place is almost empty and for good reason. First time I felt completely betrayed by Yelp users.  Though iust say I am happy that I came here so I can warn other users who come because of reviews. I rather spend an hour in transportation to not waist my money here.  The waiter is a lady that can't speak english to save her life.  DONT WALK AWAY RUN!   As I was writing this review they changed my opinion from a one star to a 0! when they brought this role that looked like it had pink vomit on it. For those who wonder about flavor let me describe sushi here BLAND, DULL, FLAVORLESS.  To wrap it up I wouldn't eat here free I hope that this place doesnt rip you of because I felt cheated off money.   Lastly got to yama sushi on flamingo and sakana on Maryland parkway great sushi."}
{"text":"Great value and good service.  I will definitely go again.  My only complaint is that they should have a kids menu.  Had the kids split something.  It worked out though.  Other than that, the food was good and came out fast.  We will be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"wow\" this place is the best sushi in  Las Vegas and possibly better than any other experience I have had..sushi is very delicious,fresh and pretty..I  was throughly impressed when i tried everything..All staffs are very kind, nice and awesome...I strongly recommend this place!!!I will say that you will not be disappointed in anything in this place..I already miss all food what I tried today!!!"}
{"text":"There food was really great but the serving is very slow here was only one person to serving whole restaurants and floor was little bit dirty."}
{"text":"While I normally don't eat sushi this place has a ton of different rolls that you can try. I am sure that you will find some flavors that will please your pallet. Some of my favorite rolls that I have tried are the Japanese Lasagna Roll, Nevada Queen Roll, X Man, and The Who's Your daddy Roll. The server is constantly present and eager to take your order. My experience here has always been pleasant."}
{"text":"I live close but I've gone all over the valley and tried almost all the sushi bars. This place is a ma and Pa ran classic sushi place. The best garlic tuna ever. Also see spoon shooter. The sushi is delicious and the cold saki is sweet. But the experience really shines in the winter when u can have hot saki to perfectly complete it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always come here when I'm craving sushi! They have great customer service. They always have games on their tv. They are fast when it comes to your orders. Everything taste great. My fav on their sushi list is the jalape√±o popper roll & Snow White roll. Their dessert menu is great too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area and decide to give this place a try. Honestly the service was mediocre at best. They probably only checked up on us twice.   We had the all you can eat, and maybe it was just the rolls we chose but they tasted exactly the same. It was like having a California roll over and over again. The only roll that stood out to me was the Snow White roll. There was nothing that actually stood out to us. I wouldn't personally wouldn't come back here"}
{"text":"The service is great from the moment you walk in the door. The food speaks for its self but you must sit at the bar so you can enjoy the amazing crafters of such delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town my go to spot  I love the saki and sushi best deal in town. The service was great and the sushi quality was amazing. Hamachi was my favorite! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour to be served 2 seafood salads and 1 plate of sushi, while another table was being served with more than 5 rolls already. Food was decent, but service was unorganized and horribly slow. I think it's funny they even have a \"time limit\" on their AYCE with their type of service! Don't go there unless you plan on leaving still hungry and angry!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good i have never been disappointed with the service or the quality of sushi. The moon dog and something special were really good"}
{"text":"I am so disappointing for their service. We had our first order after 30 minute and the service was very very slow. I wish I could give no star. And their salmon was way too thin, I had many AYCE before but its my first time to see that thin salmon. Over all taste was not bad but still,  Dont go here I encourage you to find some other place."}
{"text":"dropped by on our week long trip.  pleasantly surprised with this little gem.  food is good, service is homey, the family loved the place."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi every time we come! Friendly servers and nice atmosphere. The music is also very nice with different genres that still fit the theme."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Would give them a five but they're slow getting the food out. Probably because they only had one chef. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the best little spots in town. Unbelievable food and unbelievable chefs who know how to manipulate flavors like a very few can. Original sauces and dressings highlight the unbelievably fresh quality of their fish. If your a sushi lover and you're in Vegas it's a must.  -Jason Strange-"}
{"text":"The worst service ever in sushi! I'm a sushi fanatic and  the sushi was horrible! With very bad service. Extremely slow I mean very slow! Energy Ora vibration extremely bad! Maybe  rating this restaurant 1/10 is a negative 10 extremely bad! Much love n aloha.   - star rating"}
{"text":"Good sushi, perfect for after Red Rock climbing.we ordered 3 rolls and Saki. Fast service and decent prices...better than the strip for sure. TVs at bar in case you want to watch a game"}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing and the staff are very welcoming and friendly! The service and setting of the restaurant is also great. Overall, a pretty good sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Best priced all you can eat in town! The staff is outstanding! Upon entering the establishment, the staff makes you feel welcomed. If you dine at the sushi bar the chefs are always checking up on you to make sure you are not missing anything. The food is served in a timely manner. Finally, the food in this establishment is outstanding; from their specialty plates to their simplest sushi rolls."}
{"text":"My fella and I love, LOVE O-My Sushi. We come here as often as we can and when we do the wait staff is always so sweet. We appreciate that there are not a million rolls with cream cheese like many other restaurants in town.  Our usual experience consists of a large Sapporo and large Asahi along with our FAVORITE, White Peach sake. We generally do AYCE and stuff ourselves.   The rolley rice is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi:) very quick service. I came at 4:30 as my husband  had an evening flight to catch. Poke tuna was tasty. The cut of tuna was too large but still good and they do baked scallop rolls!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place! Great quality and service is very fast. Also! You can't beat the the all you can eat price!! My favorite :)"}
{"text":"We Love this place. Have been coming here for many years! Friendly staff always, will continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"O-my Sushi Is the best sushi in town for the quality and value.  The restaurant is located conveniently in the mall near Target, Ross, Cheese Cake Factory and Starbucks, walking distance to everything.   O-my Sushi seems to be the place to go for lunch. While we have only eaten here for dinner, we can confirm that the sushi is not only fresh but is also reasonably price, in the evenings. Atmosphere is good and there are big TVs for you to watch games. We typically ordered all you can eat dinners. Presentation on their meals was pretty eye-popping. The Screaming Orgasms, Baby rock n' Roll, Poki and Mountain Roll was very delicious."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I wasn't sure if this place was a \"wait to be seated\" or \"seat yourself\" kind of place, but after waiting to be seated for a long 2 minutes, I figured it was a sit yourself kind of restaurant.  It wasn't until 10 minutes until I got asked what I wanted to drink, and 15 minutes until I got offered the menu.  When the sushi came, I asked for spicy ponzu, and the waitress never came with it.  Bottom line, the service here is terrible.  Luckily for this place, I'm the kind of person where if the food is amazing, regardless of how good or bad the service is, then I will be back.  With that said, the sushi here was pretty tasty, and I will be back in the unforeseen future.    I'm kind of hoping I just caught these guys on a bad night, because I'm up for giving these guys another shot and hope to have a better experience with their service next time I come here!"}
{"text":"The service is slow and impersonal. We were the only table there! The sushi is actually decent- not the best but not the worst. The prices for rolls seem lower than other restaurants. I would return for the convenience and price and bare with the service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places. Good pricing, good service, good food. The waitress is very nice. The pricing of the lunch specials are great. The location of this place makes it great for lunch breaks."}
{"text":"I ve been here a long time ago but I guess it was a different name. None the less, it still looks quaint and service is friendly and efficient. I yet have to taste food while I wait for my to go order. Will update after I try."}
{"text":"The food is great, but sometimes the service is slow and I have tried to dine and they would be closed. I was there during their open hours, but no one was inside and there was no sign on the door. Good food, but it is a shame they are not consistent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try to this place out on a whim. It's a great sushi location in Summerlin, in the Boca Park shopping center. It's a decent size sushi place with beautiful Japanese decor. Our server was also in a gorgeous top that went wonderfully with the decor. Our server was sweet, and I could see the sushi chef took pride in each roll he made.  We went with the AYCE menu for dinner which was priced the standard of $24.99. They have an impressive menu, and we didn't even get to try everything because our bellies got full. From the apps we had gyoza, which reminded me of the Filipino dish lumpia, probably because it had pork and veggies inside. Still good though. I always like to try something out of the ordinary and samples their avocado and cucumber roll from their veggie menu. This was a bit dry for my taste, but with some soy sauce, better. From their nigiri menu we tried the garlic tuna, garlic hamachi (yellowtail), and super white. I was impressed with both garlic choices, but I was disappointed by the super white. Super white is my favorite thing to order whenever I go for sushi, but this one was very different from how most places serve it.  It had no sauce and it was wrapped in a tiny sliver of seaweed. It was dry, but was fine after dipping in some soy sauce. From the regular roll I took a gander at the spicy hamachi which was yummy and not spicy. From the special roll menu we tried the Aloha (so tasty if you enjoy the garlic ponzu sauce, which I do. It's my favorite from this evening), shrimp lover (good as well), dragon (on point for the typical dragon), Nevada queen (I hated the cream cheese in this, but he enjoyed it), Summerlin (sweet flavor;similar to the dragon. My boyfriend enjoyed the avocado on it.), moon dog (another garlic ponzu flavor), and snow white (this was my boyfriend's favorite because it was  different and refreshing. I liked how crunchy it was). At the end instead of an ice cream treat which is included in the AYCE, we decided to pay more and have the teas. My boyfriend went for the Thai tea, no boba. They took a different spin on it, more creamy, but in a good way. I saw matcha milk tea, and I knew I had to try it, but with boba of course! It was refreshingly good. The server told me this was a new item on their menu and was enthused to hear how much I liked it.  This place is worth your money. I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was ok. Somewhat difficult to order with English barrier. The service could be better."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as I wrapped up my day.  Place was completely empty when I walked in so I sat at the bar, and did the all you can eat.  Sushi chef at the bar was prompt and food came to me quickly.  Food was ok.  Nothing special and there are much better options in the area for both AYCE or just a quick bite."}
{"text":"Just Ok. Korean owned sushi bar. Chinese sushi chef.. Almost average... No return for me. JKKUHL"}
{"text":"The food was very bland to say the least. Service was good, but my friend and I truly didn't enjoy the food. We chose this restaurant BECAUSE of the many great yelp reviews, and wow. Way to disappoint people!! Heed my warning!! They skimp you on the fish, I left still hungry. I didn't care to eat any more flavorless food. The tastiest thing was the seaweed salad. My friend had diarrhea afterwards to say the least. I highly recommend that you go somewhere else if you want tasty sushi. If you want great service and blah food then eat here. I've never felt so lied to and betrayed by yelp users before smh"}
{"text":"Really nice people always asking if we need and their sushi is really good and freshly displayed. Everyone is very nice and fairly priced compared to other sushi places."}
{"text":"Our favorite family Sushi place in Las Vegas! We moved recently from Hawaii and looked all our around am settled on O My Sushi as our favorite place. It is always friendly, fast and fresh and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"O my, this is yummy indeed!  Fresh fish, great portions and lovely atmosphere.  Had to take a star off since I had to order a Pinot Grigio three times and the server didn't seem familiar with it even though it's on the menu.  Poor girl but now she knows.  Staff is pleasant and not pushy.  Clean restaurant and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's a really good please nice vibe! The food is amazing!!!! I don't think I even been in sushi place that every thing I tested was good and testy!!! The ppl here are nice too and kind!!! I'm come here every week at least once!"}
{"text":"Here again tonight. Just as good as the last several times we were here. Always wonderful and kind staff :)"}
{"text":"Tried \"All you can eat menu\", newer seen such a small rolls.) Small menu to choose from.Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"It amazing the best sushi I had  I eat here all the time the service is great as well  And the boba drinks are good"}
{"text":"O My Sushi is my favorite local sushi spot! Their all you can eat is super affordable and everything is wonderful. It never disappoints"}
{"text":"This is the WORST SUSHI I have EVER ate... I don't even know if I even like sushi anymore. Decent prices but you get what you pay for!!! 5 thumbs DOWN!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent and very clean. The service was extraordinary. I will definitely come back here with my family. The Las Vegas and Aladdin roll are amazing."}
{"text":"Start out with the good: service was great! The waitresses were quite nice and we were well tended to.   The real meat of this review (HAHA!) is that none of the fish had any flavor. This was the blandest and most mediocre sushi I've ever had. I actually ended up salting everything I ordered (which was a lot, because I did the All You Can Eat). Here's a good application of my opinion: my wife decided she would be adventurous and try some sushi this time. I ordered a roll with things I knew she'd like, and when it came out I refused to let her try any of it. I was worried she would be put off of trying sushi again because this was a very poor example of what she should expect.   The sauces were fine, which I'm not surprised about. Every sushi restaurant in town probably buys jugs of them from the same handful of distributors.   The rice was fine, which I'm not surprised about because it isn't supposed to taste like anything.  The rolls were wrapped a bit poorly. The ingredients were distributed unevenly so the end pieces had almost nothing in them but rice. They were also loose I'm really, really poor with chopsticks but I keep trying. Loose rolls are very, very difficult to pick up. I ate half of my food with my fingers instead.   Also, there was a lot of rice. The ratio of rice to fish to veg was definitely tilted toward rice, and definitely away from the fish. Not that it would have made much flavor difference -- the rice was more flavorful than the fish was -- but if I have the option of eating rice, which is completely empty of nutrition, and fish, which is exceptionally nutritious,the choice is clear.   And it is really irritating to pay $12 for a roll of mostly rice with a little bit of low-quality fish in it."}
{"text":"They may have changed the sign out front, but it's still Tokyoto Sushi- same staff and chefs, same menu. Instead of AYCE, I usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials- the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as you'll get here, but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice, for an additional $1 each.  Lunch specials are on a separate menu. Even going during lunch, this menu is not provided upon seating. It's also not provided when you ask for it. I had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so I could order- kind of irritating. Other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit, service was polite.  The lunch combo #3 is my favorite: miso soup and two gyoza, plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list. The given options are just okay, most of them are shrimp tempura rolls. The namesake OMy roll and the Aladdin roll are both fairly plain, and the rice fell apart where sauces were used."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ!!! Straight up, save yourself, just don't come here... just don't. This is the worst sushi I have ever had, in fact, the worst food I've ever had in general. The texture was so odd, too much rice, just overall poor quality. There are better all you can eat spots for the same price. Just go somewhere you know is good. Surprised this place is still open honestly. Service sucks and honestly kind of concerned I might get food poisoning"}
{"text":"Pretty frustrating. Restaurant is supposed to open at 11 a.m. and I stop by to pick up Sushi to go to surprise my wife for lunch. No one even arrives at the restaurant until 11:20 when a lady walks through front door and it's clear there's no chef or anyone inside so getting something prepared isn't going to happen for who-knows-how-long. Guess I'll just start going to the new place on West Lake Mead that has that super sushi chef that made Sushi Fever special."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon with no more than 8 people in the restaurant.  There was one sushi chef and one waitress, which would seem adequate for the volume, but for some reason they seemed \"backed up\"...empty dishes still on the table, and orders seem to take long, but I will say are thoughtfully created, some were very artful.  However,  just hard when there is 1 hour limit on AYCE and it was taking about 20 minutes per order.  I totally understand pacing and not wasting, but this is just a bit too long to really \"feel\" the indulgent pleasure of AYCE. I could have eaten more, but time was UP!  Please do try this place, their sushi is reflective of the genuine passion of the chef. Definitely a value in itself."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful The service is absolutely amazing and it is always very clean. The sushi is so good and always fresh. I stumbled in one time and have come here for every sushi craving ever since. Prices are very good."}
{"text":"Best sushi on the North West side of Vegas.  We've been coming here for several years now."}
{"text":"We love this place, great service best sushi in town best value super fresh and a huge selection to choose from! I have eaten at many sushi houses in Las Vegas and this one is best by far. A must try lunch or dinner always great. Thank you for taking great care of us!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, yummy sushi, great place over all. Try boba drinks  Probably one of the best sushi places in town as far as taste. Really homey feeling while eating In the restaurant. Loved sitting at the sushi bar, the cooks are pretty entertaining."}
{"text":"Good food, private environment, and very authentic people. My whole family liked the rolls."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Las Vegas!  Great flavor and service.  Great variety of rolls and appetizers.  Staff of friendly and knowledgeable.  Prompt service.  Good ambiance.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Came here the previous night with family, it was just us and another group on one table and one guy at the bar so it was pretty deserted. Lady who was our server was very attentive and nice but the reason for the two stars was that the sushi was honestly really not great and the chef who was making the sushi was really taking his time making them. He was taking a while either because he didn't feel the urgency to make the sushi fast on a dead weekday or because of the fact that he was talking very VERY loudly to the only man who was at the bar. Overall, would never come here again, might as well  drive the extra 10-15 mins and head over to Yama or Kaya."}
{"text":"So good! Our first time here and we sat at the sushi bar, Sushi chef Steven was awesome. So attentive and helpful. The rolls were perfect! It's the best finding a place by the house that is so good. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is located in boca park and there's never a long wait. This place is nice and quiet. They have an all you can eat for around 25 dollars per person! They're selection is good and they have many yummy rolls to choose from!!!"}
{"text":"This place is lousy. Fish was paper thin on top of a block of rice. Service was slow and it wasn't even busy. I asked for quail egg on my uni and they charge $1 for each quail egg. Chef forgets my orders and had to remind him a couple of times what I wanted. I suggest to go to another sushi restaurant and ditch this place. Trust me it's not worth it. I don't understand how this place has 4 stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"Valentine's night, place is small and in my opinion, busy. Took a while for service. Ordered several rolls on the All-you-can-eat menu. Rolls were great, especially  Call 911 roll. Service can be a bit better. For whatever reason i felt  a bit ignored."}
{"text":"Hubby and I loved this place. The sushi maker guy is funny, too. Awesome time n good food. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner - hit the spot after climbing! Would recommend to others looking for creative rolls and an extensive menu"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted immediately by their very friendly staff. The hostess is very kind and our drinks were never empty. The food is absolutely amazing! The fish is so fresh and delicious! All you can eat doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Slow service, only had one chef and one server, granted it was a Wednesday night. Alot of stuff not included in their AYCE, stuff I normally order from my favorite sushi places. Fish wasn't fresh, rice wasn't even season. The ponzu sauce they put on their dish is so sour. Anyways, I should've know better when I found out how cheap  is their AYCE dinner. I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"So this place, overall, was pretty decent but I just found too many negatives and didn't leave with any \"Omg I need to get that roll again \" feelings.   Pros: Friendly service, clean place, cheap price. For all you can eat for 3 adults, 1 spam masubi, 1 spam masubi/fries, 3 drinks totaled $80.  Cons: -Couldn't share my all you can eat with my 2 years old.  -waiter didn't have an answer to half of our questions.    -what drinks do you have for kids?    -baked muscles apart of your all you can eat?    -didn't know what Tai was. -fish slices were thin and small. -half rolls were limited.  I would go there again if I was in the area, but nothing there says \"oh shit I gotta go back and get me some of dat!)"}
{"text":"We got two orders of the popular sushi rolls and one specialty roll! Was very good!! Boba tea is definitely worth ordering and decently priced. Looking forward to coming back in the future !"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! Right in heart of Summerlin. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I would have to say this place has one of the biggest roll selection I've seen in awhile. Overall the food was good, I didn't care too much for their eel sauce and there garlic ponzu sauce and the service was whatever. They were just REALLY serious and quite but they didn't mess up any of our orders and the food was good so I guess it's all right."}
{"text":"Would never come to an ACYE, but was invited by my friends parent, so said hey why not! Well I arrived a bit earlier than my party, and the hostess decided to sit me.  First she was going to place me behind a wall, but I wanted to be near the tv since the marathon was on,  so sat closer to the door at the table that seated four; right in front of the tv.  Well I guess the manager(older woman) didn't like where I was seated in the resturant, and made me move to the table directly right across from the table I was seated-which was behind an artifical tree.  She gives me a lame excuse  \"since your going to be seated with a party of 3 this table is for 4 or more.\" I question her motives stating \"the table your requesting me sit at is right next to this one, and it has 4 chairs too.\" Not one to put up a fuss I moved to the table behind the tree  (still in sight of the tv) and next to a couple(2) sitting at a 4 sitter table as well. Lo and behold nobody sat at that table in fact they seated a couple with a toddler child 15 minutes after my arrival (see attaches image)   The experience was so mortifying that I had no words- as the entire resturant seen this older woman direct me a \"black\" woman to be out of eyes view for no reason, besides my skin color . My appetite is now ruined- hate that I can't review the resturant as a whole, but CUSTOMER SERVICE is equally as important. The joke is, when my guest arrived  (white couple) they questioned why are we behind this tree?!    PLEASE NOTE- I WOULD NEVER CALL A PERSON AND/OR ESTABLISHMENT RACIST IF IT IS NOT WARRANT; AND AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAD INTERACTION VS BEING JUDGE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF MY GENETIC MAKEUP. Pictures to follow."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Super nice workers Best sushi ever with decent prices(: definitely would recommend. Super tasty, great vibes, looks beautiful inside. Good for the whole family or for a date. My favorite sushi place in town hands down. Don't expect it to be speedy but worth the wait"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite sushi spot! The sushi is always made great and fresh and the staff are amazing :)"}
{"text":"I would give this establishment a negative 5 . Their fish quality is really terrible/ bad and I wouldn't even say the sushi here is edible . Their salmon and tuna was not fresh at all , it smelt like plastic and tasted stale in a way . I was very upset , and not even that it takes a long time to receive your order . The (nigiri ) fish was so finely sliced that the rice was showing through. Was not satisfied at all !"}
{"text":"O my sushi is my usual go to when close to home and craving sushi.  The food is always served quickly, the fish is always fresh, and the older gentleman who makes the sushi is like a steel trap.  Every time my girlfriend and I sit down to order our ayce , he takes both orders (which are usually pretty hefty since I can put some sushi away) he asks once.  And never misses a thing.  Wait staff is always friendly and quick to bring you refills and appetizers.  Great place in Summerlin if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite japenese restaurant I got the o my roll Mimi roll Aladdin roll orange blossom roll and the something special roll. And at the end Mochi ice cream ."}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. Not only is the food incredible and crave able, but out server Donna was wonderful! She was so sweet and attentive, as well as knowledgable. Haven't left yet and I already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night when we were in the area for Total Wine due to Yelp reviews. Staff was super friendly and fast with taking our orders. My husband and I got the AYCE ($24.95) and were not disappointed. We also got a Yuzu flavored Sake drink that was 10% alcohol (Super Delicious).   We started off with a few apps that included Agedashi Tofu, Maru Wha and the Spoon Shooter. My favorite was definitely the Spoon Shooter. We followed up with some Nigiri and Special Rolls. My favorite nigiri included the Garlic Tuna, Sweet Shrimp (With fried heads), Tamago, and Unagi. All of the special rolls were A+ in my book. We got the Mimi Roll, Princess Irene Roll, Captain Roll and the Rolley Rice. I would suggest everyone get the Rolley Rice even though it isn't a roll but its the first time I've had such good   We were in and out within the hour. Wanted to try more things on the menu but was too full. Will have to come back again to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Located in Boca park, the interior is small and super cute. They have boba drinks and sushi! They offer a 5 star review for a free boba drink, so my review is edited. Service was very slow and the food was just so so"}
{"text":"Loved the food! We did all you can eat and my son did the ramen. Everything was delicious and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp tempura udon. Pretty good nothing too exciting. It was a little oily and the shrimp tempura was pretty skimpy. Not sure I'll be back but service was good. I was there for 40 minutes and no one came in. One couple sat next to me and it remained that way until I left."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and boba !! Great customer service and quiet dining area will come back again and I recommend to friends !"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was fast and friendly. Very much appreciated. My date was a hot mess. It was a perfect lunch date"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty! Not a lot of salmon selection though.. Slow service , should have had another waiter."}
{"text":"It was good.  I had the AYCE dinner which was 24.99.  Good prices.  The service was good, the waiter always came up to us and asked if we needed anything else. The good thing is that I was able to order half rolls (4 pieces intead of 8).  I had many things on the menu and I enjoyed it all.    I am a big Sea Urchin (uni) fan.  Uni has to be fresh and it has to have a specific taste.  The uni here was good, but I admitt I've had fresher else where.   The sweet shrimp wasnt as good.  The head was delicious but the shrimp I could of lived without.  I get sweet shrimp every sushi place, but like the uni it has to be specific and fresh.   The spoon shooter hit the spot.  Tuna with a delcious sauce on a spoon.    The seared salmon was very delcious and fresh and just melted in my mouth.    All in all, this place has good AYCE options :)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time, and I will DEFINITELY be coming back. In fact, O-My is probably my new Summerlin go-to for sushi.   Everything was phenomenal. Nothing but compliments about presentation, fish quality or flavor. Tried a variety of rolls, and must recommend: -Titanic (deep fried) -Rolley Rice -Sexy Lady  They have unique rolls I haven't seen elsewhere, service was friendly and attentive and overall just an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Fish was horrible it looked old the color was dark. I had to stop eating because I was afraid I'd get food poison. I knew the fish was old by the time the uni came out I eat uni ALL THE TIME so when it arrived at my table and the color was off I knew I had to get up and leave. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO THIS PLACE. If I could give this no stars I would but I can't."}
{"text":"Went in for an anniversary dinner. The place was pretty empty and this was my first time at a sushi restaurant with a female sushi chef. She was very good and attentive and I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"I was out running errands. While in Boca Park, I saw this place and needed to stop for some fuel. I hadn't been here before although we've seen it many times. I'm the only one at home that really loves sushi. I stopped in for a roll. The menu is very extensive and they have some great deals for lunch. I chose a single spicy tuna roll, a side of edamame and an iced tea. Everything was fresh and tasty. I will definitely need to come back with my friends and try some of the specialty rolls. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good all you can eat sushi spot in Summerlin and great service! I noticed a la carte prices were decent too, $8 - $12 per roll. Everything made to fresh to order! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite all you can eat sushi in town! You don't have to do all you can eat if you don't want either. Can't beat a $4 glass of red wine either! It's half price for young kids for all you can eat too. The waitresses are helpful with ordering. One of our favorites is the \"who's your daddy\" roll. We also like the dragon, candy, and my boys love their California rolls. This place is a hidden gem in boca park!"}
{"text":"A great night out having  the best sushi. Service was excellent and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I took my grandpa here and he loved it, it is quiet and nice. Plus the food was very quick to come out and delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped by love the rolls.  Superb customer oriented service.  Try the dragonball. Delishh You can even get yourself a free mug just by yelping something short and sweet.  Personally I had the shrimp tempura, the Dragon ball, the lion king, and currently tho king of a fried Philly roll and perhaps some green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"They had a great selection and great music! The server was very informative and friendly! I would love to introduce this place to some friends"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, offers a lot of rolls and the staff is friendly. They also offer the bubbla teas. They have a decent amount of appetizers, however the potsticker things were  drenched in oil."}
{"text":"Huge variety of rolls and other options! Great food and service and would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"To be honest I really enjoyed the atmosphere as soon as I got there. It was nice and the greeting from the chefs was welcoming. The server helped us out right away she was well spoken and waited for our orders. The red lights and hip music make it a nice feel and vibe. I was in love with this place but then it got busy. I know for sure as hell our table brought the party after that shit went down. The sever completely forgot about us so fucking rude like bitch we came here first ugghhh like seriously. But atleast i was somewhat full thanks to my sappori but other then that i would come back hehe xD"}
{"text":"Foods really good! Service is great. Ordered the monkey roll, California roll, and spicy tuna. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this place and we were greeted by the friendliest waitress ive ever encountered. Her name is Lindsey, she was very attentive and the sushi was great. My favorite roll was the princess irene roll. The screaming orgasm is a must have!!!"}
{"text":"O my Sushi is such a great place to go if you're wanting sushi. The fish is fresh, the employees are sweet, and the environment is very nice. When I walked in it felt really cozy and the employees made me feel really welcome. My favorite thing that I had there was the dragon ball. It was super delicious and I just couldn't get enough! I've been here a couple of times and I've loved every single experience. I've recommended this place to a couple of my friends and they all have loved it. This place is also a great place for friends to hang out. It's very chill and relaxing. The food is great and you can really catch up with friends. Everything about this place is great!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place ever. It has good mood lighting, pleasant music, and a nice selection of sushi. Also their boba is the best. I would highly recommend everyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"We walked in recently towards the end of the night.  Despite it being close to last call all the staff and chefs were very nice and patient. I almost always do AYCE.  The value is great and the quality of fish I have experienced  is consistent.  I'm a huge salmon skin hand roll fan so of course I always order that.  It's very good.  Just usually takes some time.  The salmon is fresh as is the tuna nigiri.  I haven't tried many appetizers as I usually stick to rolls and sushi but based on that experience I would try some appetizers when I go back."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations, but my friends and I left dissatisfied. We came to what seemed would be a nice dinning experience on a weekday and boy were we wrong. I have never experienced such horrible service! It all started with the waitress, she had to repeatedly confirm our order because she didn't write it down correctly. We all did all you can eat and seriously need to consider changing their name to You'll never Eat Sushi being that our entire order was coming out one by one every 20-25min or not coming out at all. We had to ask were our rolls were at several times and all we got was that they were coming. The restaurant was not busy for them to be that slow especially when there are four people making the sushi. One of the orders I placed in my first round came two hours later. You can tell the other diners were upset as they also would ask what was taking so long. We even had to ask for the waitress to refill our waters as they were not doing that either. I'm not the type of person to complain, but I was sure livid! But what made it worse is that they didn't even seem apologetic even after I expressed how upset we were. She was like yes the kitchen is slow. Really, that is all you can tell me. I must admit the rolls were good but definitely not worth the wait. We were there for over three hours and asked to speak to a manager since we felt that we should get a discount for what we had endured. But no manager was available. I was ready to walk out of that place because supposedly they could not even offer us a discount or just simply an apology. I'm not the person to just walk away and not pay, but was close to it after we finally continued to dispute our bill and got them to give us some type of compensation which we told her we would only pay them what we feel we should pay or walk out. I'll never come here again and would suggest you think twice about dinning here!"}
{"text":"O-My sushi is a decent place. The fish is fresh and the rolls are ok, not bad, but nothing spectacular. It was good, but there is a dozen others I can think of that are substantially better. Like others have commented, I too,  found the service rather slow. It wasn't really busy or anything, but just took forever to get the orders after they were placed. Four of us went and did the AYCE. The menu is pretty good sized but to me seemed basic, not creative. One of the hot items I ordered, the dynamite, came out cold. Not warm, but cold. Other than that the food was good, not great. If I was in the area and wanted sushi, I would go again but I wouldn't make a trip just to go. My wife felt the same as I. Her response when I asked how she liked it was, \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Omg this sushi was amazing! Very tasty and nice presentation. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly but the service was still slow. The only good experiences I've had here were under the previous name when no one else was in the restaurant. Not worth coming here when there are other better places in the valley."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Great service from the female sushi chef. (Fist female sushi chef I've ever seen) I loved walking in and hearing the Japanese music. I hate it when I walk into an \"authentic\" sushi place and they're playing 94.1. I will return. 4 stars and not 5 simply because I got a plastic water cup instead of a beer glass for my Sapporo. Other than that, great sushi joint."}
{"text":"Pretty good deal.  The screaming orgasm roll is very good.  The dragon wheel is a great choice of you want something spicy.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to many AYCE sushi places in town, but this is hands down my favorite!! Not only is it close to my house, but the sushi is amazing. I love anything to do with garlic so their garlic tuna and garlic hamachi is perfection! One of my favorite rolls here is spicy tuna holic. I have nothing negative to say about this place! The staff is always friendly and efficient! This place is now my go to AYCE sushi place!!"}
{"text":"Too much rice with the nigiri, the crunchy dragon roll wasn't the best dragon roll I've had, but everyone has their taste. Also, I think their spicy ramen had a similar taste to the neoguri seafood instant noodles."}
{"text":"Great selection. Plenty of appetizers that are yummy! Very friendly atmosphere. It was busy for a wed night so the only waitress was doing her best. Overall good place!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try because I happen to be in this area of town... I was very disappointed! Service was not good...Even though we were seated immediately, we had too long of a wait...before our order was taken. They were a little busy, but it wasn't a full house.  Bottom line, the two waitresses didn't appear to know what the other was doing. They were trying...but sadly they were unorganized. I did the AYCE sushi, plenty of choices, but for me personally nothing I had stood out as far as taste. In addition I thought the portions were a little small...  The slow service & having to continually have to ask for something...made it a poor experience. Unfortunately, nothing special that would make me want to return..."}
{"text":"Disgusting food!!! Absolutely the worst sushi in Summerlin the service was horrible my daughter did not care for a sauce that had a bad after taste and they charged me anyways after she did not even eat one bite. The only customer service she gave us was to see no one ever complains. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry O-My Sushi, I really wanted to like you better.  But alas, that was not the case.  We saw the reviews and were excited to have a yummy AYCE sushi place by our house. Upon walking it, hit by the overwhelming smell of dirty frying grease. yuck! And I wish I was exaggerating! We had to wash our clothes when we got home. It was disgusting.  We ordered the sashimi salad, which had a picture in the menu that looked tasty! Seasonal greens topped with a yummy selection of thick fresh sashimi. What we got was a fist full of iceberg lettuce and some paper thin slices tossed on with out care, dressing on the side. The good part, the dressing was actually pretty good!  We had some confusion on the sushi, we ordered one special roll, and received another. Our waitress told us it was a typo on the menu, and that the right name was on another roll a few down......ummmmm OK. We got that worked out, still not very good, sadly. Neither were the other rolls we ordered.  I sat wondering, how can this place have all these 5 star reviews? What are we missing? Or are we hitting a bad night? Then I look over and see a sign on the table that stated \"with your great Yelp review, you get a free beverage and a complimentary tea cup to take home.\"  OK... so I guess a lot of people needed the free drink? Or the tea cup?? Am I the only one that finds this a bit odd? Coercing good reviews for free schwag?  Regardless, we will probably not go back. Bummer!"}
{"text":"They have some good items like the Snow White and the poke shooters. But overall I can't say the overall service is great. I've been here a few times and some days they are busy and I can expect slower service but when youre the only one in there... doesn't make much sense. Also, the fish tasted stale . Even tho it was a Monday the tempura shrimp tasted reheated and the tails were black . Highly disappointed because I love going to boca park."}
{"text":"I bought three rolls and didn't like any of them. The crab stick they use taste cheap and the eel sauce is like a glaze from a jar. I would never go back. Complete waste of money I couldn't even finish my food"}
{"text":"We ordered spicy tuna roll, salmon skin hand rolls and were very delicious, and quality, order the matcha milk tea is awesome. Will be back"}
{"text":"The sushi was very good, and the all-you-can-eat deal was a fantastic bargain. The interior was very warm and welcoming, and the green tea was really great on such a cold night. It was pretty busy and so the service was a bit slower, but overall, it was still a really fun dining experience. I'd definitely recommend this place to friends who are looking for a solid American-style sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Best hidden sushi spot in town and Steven is the best chef here. Always smiling and creating masterpieces. It's not just another AYCE joint. It's legit. Memorable rolls:  Johnny Kiss of Fire  Las Vegas Monkey"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years. I've seen this establishment grow and they have been consistent on giving good customer service and food. The staff or family is courteous and accommodating. They can be busy at times but it does not bother me. You came to experience authentic japanese food, If you can't handle the wait, just go back to your good ol' McDonald's or KFC"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten at a sushi restaurant and I don't regret choosing O-my Sushi! I got the spicy crab roll and it was incredible. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best sushi place in vegas , amazing service , awesome staff and very fresh !! Always love eating here !"}
{"text":"I like O My Sushi but after twice in a row with lousy service, we probably won't return. Every time I have been here there has only ever been one waitress, and it's not enough. Tonight was truly frustrating as my daughter had to sit and watch me eat 3 different items and her food had still not come out. Took about 15 minutes to finally get the waitress to acknowledge us, and turns out my daughters food wasn't put in. 35 minutes into an hour limit on AYCE and my daughter still had not received her food......... C'mon now..."}
{"text":"I have not tried one thing on their menu that isn't good! The yellowtail sushi is phenomenal, best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had outside of Japan.  Sit at the sushi bar and order a la carte.  The Garlic Tuna Sushi and Garlic Yellowtail Sashimi were really good."}
{"text":"Really wonderful sushi spot and the all you can eat specials are the best! Quality fish and the rice to fish ratio is perfect. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"It was good, it totally reminds me of the old school Japanese restaurants back in the day. I wouldn't give this place a terrible review like some of the other people, but when I order a few things and it's $45 for what other places wouldn't charge that much. That would be my only deterrent."}
{"text":"Oh My, Oh My, Oh My. Salmon & Tuna & Eel Oh My. The restaurant is clean. I find this trait particularly necessary in a sushi joint.  And actually the food was pretty dang good. Give \"my ex-boyfriend\" a try. I mean not mine but the roll called that. Wait ..... Not mine as in not my ex girlfriend but the roll, now that's my ex-boyfriend.  I was there at a really dead time. Would like to see this restaurant when it's busy to get its vibe. Definitely worth trying again."}
{"text":"Even the business owners are Yelp fans! AYCE? Aaah Yeeaaah Cool Eats. Let's discuss this shall we.  Impressed without partiality the second we walked in. We were greeted with accommodation and asked what we wanted to drink. Hot green tea for me, iced green tea for Ness please.  On the table a paper menu with a pen. Ooouuu all you can eat! I got excited. But our server removed the pen and paper menu... and the regular menu... Psych. Handed us laminated flip over menus. I was like hmmmm opposite from other AYCE places. Instead she wrote down our AYCE choices. It works... We can \"roll\" with that.  Didn't know there was AYCE here. Only wanted to eat sushi. Front and back menu listing tons of selections. Oh and they have boba pearl drinks!   24 side appetizers ???!!! If you just did one of each with just appetizers, you're set. No need to eat the next day - just finish digesting.  105 sushi choices ???!!! Can we download an app that helps us decide? Hey Danny didja find out yet where we can DL the 'slap em upside the head' app? I think it will come in handy for this. Categories included:¬† Nigiri, baked, special, tempura, regular, deepfried, and veggie.  By the way, who's your mommy? I can tell you she's hot. Find her on the AYCE menu. Make sure you have an ice cold drink nearby.  1 dessert per person included: ice cream or mochi... If you can still fit in your belly.  Huge siiiigh. Feeling so full already just talking about all this great food. I'll just give em a five. Can't find a reason not to sheesh. Pleasant attentive service, attractive atmosphere, clean environment, delightful cuisine flavor and presentation, timeliness with order to delivery on the table, average pricing, and AYCE includes dessert. Who wants to complain?"}
{"text":"Great service. The sushi was so good I had the crunch roll, better than other places. Had the Matcha green milk tea also great combination, highly suggest 10/10. Services were fast and efficient and were very nice. Even thought i came 30 minutes before closing... oops"}
{"text":"I can't say how impressed I am with this place! First time since the remodel and new opening. I honestly didn't have one thing that I was disappointed in. AYCE price is by far worth every penny! Service was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I ate here and we ordered 4 different rolls and they all tasted the exact same."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat and near all in Boca Park. Friendly and great food. Went door to Europin Tailor and just stopped for a quick snack."}
{"text":"Was in Boca park looking for lunch grub. Hopped on the trusty Yelp app. Low and behold up popped the this sushi joint. Man oh man was I not disappointed. This is a little hidden gem locked up in a little corner strip mall. Ordered 3 rolls to go. They were all delicious. I am definitely coming back for some more.   Me: Knock knock...... You: who's there? Me: Oh. You: Oh who? Me: O my goshi I'm glad you told me about o-my sushi!"}
{"text":"Just decided to try it on a whim one day, and within the first visit, the rolls made O My Sushi one of my favorite places to eat in the Vegas area. Not just one of my favorite sushi places, one of my favorite restaurants in general. Rolls are simply fantastic, every bite delightful. Service has been good every time, though they sometimes seem a bit understaffed. However, they've always been warm and friendly. 5 stars, not even a question."}
{"text":"Great restaurant Great service ! The Japanese Lasagna roll was to die for !! Must try !!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing great. The amount of time it took for us to actually get our food was terrible. Waitress would bring 2 rolls for 3 of us then about 20 minutes till we saw her again and we would have to ask where the rest of our food was, then another 5 minutes till she would bring something. Rediculous."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Las Vegas!! We had been climbing at red rock and craving sushi, and this place climbed to the top of our hearts. Plus if you write a good review, they'll give you a free boba. Def worth a stop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh fish and great service. The food is reasonably priced. Great location for the people of Summerlin. I would highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and very friendly staff! Definitely some of the best and freshest sushi I've ever had. The x-men special roll was amazing, as well as the Japanese Lasagne roll. This was my first visit and it definitely won't be my last!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas for over 3yrs and tried so many Sushi restaurants. O My Sushi (formerly Tokyoto) has never left me disappointed. The Aladdin, Kiss of Fire, Who's your daddy? & Ex-Boyfriend rolls are my favorites. They taste so fresh and flavorful. You won't even need soy!"}
{"text":"This place was great. It was quite and intimate. It took a little while to get anything but there were quite a few tables and only 3 employees. There were so many options and I did enjoy the items I ordered. I admit that the amount of sauce they put on everything was a little overwhelming though. The price on the menu for AYCE was less than they actually charge, but only by a couple dollars and still very reasonable for dinner. Overall great sushi spot and I will def go back again."}
{"text":"The price point was good for AYCE but I was disappointed by the quality of the sushi (food but not great - less fresh than a roll from Whole Foods) and the large amount of sauce on the rolls.   The server was exceptionally polite and helpful, replacing the rolls that came with the sauce.   Overall: 4 stars. Okay, but not great."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  This was our second visit to this place and will be our last.  After reading all of the yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try.  Wasn't so bad the first time.  Our visit tonight was unbelievable.  Service was extremely slow and they weren't even busy.  There were 3 other parties there when we arrived and because it took so long for our food, all 3 of them left.  So we were the only ones there.  I ordered a sexy lady roll.  When I picked up the 4th piece there was a very long black hair.  I put the hair on my plate and swirled it in a circle.  We called the waitress over and she just smiled and took the plate out back.  She came back a short time later to question me as to whether the hair was in the roll or on the outside.  Told her it was on the inside. She goes back out back. When she finally comes back out she says that it is a dyed hair and not the hair of the lady that was making sushi earlier when we walked in. So I asked her if she was accusing me of lying and this was my hair.  She just stood there with a stupid grin on her face. She said there was no way it could have been on the inside because they cut the roll with a knife and the hair wouldn't have been that long.  The manager or owner never came over  to our table. They never offered any comp of our meal only stood there accusing me of planting the hair there.  Yes I have dyed hair but my hair is red and short.  So fuck off bitch.  It was the lady that was making sushi when we got there.  She had long black hair and was only pinned back with a bow.  If I could give them minus stars that would be my rating.  STAY AWAY from this place.  They need to close this dump down once and for all!"}
{"text":"It's a really good please nice vibe! The food is amazing!!!! I don't think I even been in sushi place that every thing I tested was good and testy!!! The ppl here are nice too and kind!!! I'm come here every week at least once!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Vegas. The sushi chef makes the most absolutely tastiest rolls ever. 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi place and great location. AYCE was only $23! One of the best deals in town! The fish was a very good quality and the rice-to-fish ratio was good. There were a lot of Roll options which I always appreciate when going out for sushi. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to come.                            Very calm and quiet environment..........................................................................................."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday from 1pm-6pm. Until about 5pm, the restaurant was quiet and not very busy. The restaurant is well decorated and kept very clean. The service was on point. Never did we have to ask for a refill on drinks. The sushi was fresh. As it was Sunday, a gentleman at the bar asked for football and with no hesitation they changed the channel. Overall a pleasant experience. I would recommend coming here on a lunch break or quick bite."}
{"text":"Service is a bit stiff but food makes up for it. Great quality, selection, and taste. Make sure to be clear weather you want to do ACYE or a la carte."}
{"text":"Finally found a great AYCE sushi place in Summerlin/NW area. The service was excellent and the fish is fresh and the rolls are creative.  My favorite was the Poke, Tiger Roll and the Jungle Jim Roll. Definitely get the spoon shooter. Super tasty bite!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of this place, I was excited to try it. It didn't disappoint. Great food, affordable and excellent service. We ordered and appetizer and a few rolls, they were all great. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly some really good sushi. Especially in the area where the prices are all really close, the quality stands out. The chef Choi was very friendly and definitely added to the atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"If you in Summerlin and like sushi you have to try it out! This place is great! Such a comfortable setting and the sushi is delicious! The lion king, titanic and crunchy roll is my favorite. Price is perfect for the food and service you get."}
{"text":"This is probably  favorite sushi place to come to, it's close to home, it's in an shopping area, customer service amazing, food is YUMMY and play lovely music"}
{"text":"I Love this place, the sushi is fresh, the taste is great. I highly recommend this place! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in Summerlin. Try the listed specials!  We had the Spicey tunaholic and Cupid Flower, they were both booooomb!  The fish is very fresh and they have yummy miso and boba. Great price point and fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and wanted to try it cause of the good reviews.  Great service friendly.  Kids were happy with the ramen.  Me and the husbands had the ayce.  Best rolls were the dragon ball and Nevada queen so good.  Poke was great and you gotta order the screaming O Gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Very very very fresh fish. My mother ordered the poke salad and Gina roll. DA bomb. Uni was the freshest I've ever tasted. Very satisfying and hit the spot perfectly. 10/10 recommended"}
{"text":"Big menu. Lots of rolls to choose from for AYCE.   I was a little taken back that they wanted to charge $13 for my 3 year old. So, we ordered him a la carte instead.   Service was slow. They need more help. It was a busy Saturday night and our server was overwhelmed.   Nothing special to report. Everything was tasty. I'd go back if I was hungry for sushi and in the area."}
{"text":"Some rolls I really liked, others were underwhelming.  I did like the fact it is a family run establishment.  The fish was fresh.  Next time, I won't get the AYCE option. I wasn't aware of two separate menus before we ordered.  I would give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was Tokyoto Sushi. Menu and people are the same. Still one of my fave sushi spots. We never do AYCE, so the a la cart menu is awesome. Love the Heart Attack I roll!"}
{"text":"We had the all you can eat and the orders came quickly and tasted really good. I will definetly be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place and great food! Yummy  Boba too! AYE is $19.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner. Try the Spoon Shooter and Screaming Orgasm will make your  roll back into your head. Just kidding never had it but I like the Crispy Pong Pong!"}
{"text":"The only reason this places is getting 2 stars is b.c the staff was very friendly. However, the food service was horrible. It took us an average of 15 mins to get two rolls. The fish wasn't the greatest and the fish portion were unreasonably small when ordering nigiri. We were cut off b.c of their 1 1/2 dinner time limit. This upset me the most b.c we were waiting for or food longer than actually eating. I was very disappointed after reading the reviews on Yelp, I had very high hopes for this place. Not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to O My Sushi! Nestled pleasantly in Boca Park, it is close by to so many amenities and wonderfully priced!. I love the Crazy Crab Lover roll and Calamari Tempura. The prices are also very reasonable and highly competitive. If I could come here everyday I would!"}
{"text":"I'm typically not a big fan of AYCE sushi because I feel like it's always really hard to find a place where the price and quality makes it worth it but I was very pleased with O-my sushi. I'm not from Vegas and have doubts about how fresh fish is when Vegas is a desert but the quality was pretty good. My boyfriend and I came at 3pm and paid the dinner price (24.95/person). We sat at the bar and got great service. We ordered a lot of their nigiri, as well as a few specialty rolls, and then I ended the meal with mochi (which was also included in AYCE). I really liked the garlic yellowtail and the cajun albacore sushi.  Memorable dishes that I'd recommend are: - Rolley Rice - Tuna tataki - Johnny roll - Scallop lover"}
{"text":"Great staff! Super fast! They even have boba! Tons of options! $22 for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok. Not bad. Definitely not great. But overall this place is a joke. Service was terrible. I literally ordered like a half roll of something and two orders of nigiri several times separately, only for it to be delivered almost 15-20 minutes later! And this was day time! I'm talking 4 PM with only eight other people in the restaurant (Yes, I counted) and with 2 sushi chefs. No excuses! One time I even asked about the status of two nigiri orders I placed and the waitress who originally took that order got confused and asked if I would like to order again instead? This place makes me want to go vegan. By eating here you already halfway are with all the rice they put on their rolls. I wouldn't eat here again even if I saw it at 90% off on Groupon. Regretting my usual spots of Goyemon and Sakana."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. I don't know why I come back. There is only one sushi \"chef\" behind the bar and it takes sooo long to get any of it. God forbid another customer comes in then it's twice as long of a wait. My miso soup was cold tonight and despite what rolls I ordered, they kept giving me deep fried rolls. I don't know what was happening but I wouldn't have paid $26 ayce if what I wanted was Long john silvers."}
{"text":"Fish quality is OK, no fresh wasabe available and service is slow & incompetent! They kept forgetting what we ordered and the service was so slow that we had to leave two hours later and a number of rolls we ordered had still not arrived.   The restaurant was only 1/3rs full on Friday evening and it was still slow service. Maybe it's a technique for saving on All-you-can-eat customers, but  it'll cost them my business going forward!"}
{"text":"They have good variety of appetizers and their screaming O is well... Screamingly good! Kama and baked green muscles too. They have a small staff and generally one server which can get over whelming since she is young, be sure to let them know of any allergies."}
{"text":"We went for lunch the other day and were completely underwhelmed.  First off the rice to fish ratio in the sushi was WAY off.  I get it...it's cheaper for lunch than dinner.  But that should be because:  A) People don't generally eat as much for lunch as they do for dinner.  Or:  B)  Because you're not that busy at lunch and you're trying to get folks in the door.  NOT because you're being stingy with the portions.  On a positive note though, the sushi WAS quite delicious.  The rolls on the other hand were the absolute worst I've ever seen.  Poor execution, presentation and flavor.  Service was fine, friendly and acceptable.  IMO the chef was either lazy or unskilled (maybe the main guy was off today, IDK)  But I was expecting MUCH more from a sushi joint in Summerlin.  Stick with the SW part of town which has excellent spots like Fish-N-Bowl, Soho, Japaniero and Oyshi."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place! Definitely going back the drinks were great and staff was super friendly"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is fantastic and the servers are fast and efficient. I'll definitely be visiting again soon. O-my Sushi for the WIN!"}
{"text":"It was not too busy when we went.   The waitress was new and she had difficulty with the menu.  We had to point it on the menu for her.  And forget about asking a question like \"what's in the organism?\"   I don't blame the waitress as much as the restaurant for bad training.  Now for the food.   It was very fresh and very tasty.  The rice was not the best rice which is why I think some fell apart.   However most of the sushi were excellent as to taste.   The selection is excellent and for $24 aCE is a good deal."}
{"text":"Not many selection choices here if you're looking for a variety. Not highly recommended but recommended if you get that. Won't be back anytime soon but gave it an opportunity being that I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday, not busy at all, got seated right away. We were alone in the restaurant for about 15mins. Had our first order in within 10mins of being there but took another 10mins for the first order to show up, btw any child will have to order from menu my 3yr old had to wait about 20-25mins to get a spam musubi and some fries. The dragon ball and screaming orgasm are pretty much the only things here I tried that was different from other sushi places we have eaten at and it was pretty good. All in all the sushi was good but not good enough to make this one of the regular spots.  Overall:3.5/5"}
{"text":"This is my place to go when I just want to grab some good sushi quickly. I usually come here alone and sit at the sushi bar. Everyone is friendly and I love the sushi! My go to rolls are spicy hamachi, candy roll (amazing!) and screaming-o. They also have ALL YOU CAN EAT lunch 11am-3pm $21.95 and dinner 3pm-close $24.95"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the service is wonderful and the ambiance its very nice. I would come back again and recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my friend to get boba, got really fast service the place seemed really friendly. Definitely going to back for more!"}
{"text":"Turns out theyre the homies and let you get poke bowls for take out. Love them. Super nice. Quality is way good too. I be like ay I want some sushi lately, then I b le like ayyy Im finna go to Oh My Sushi cuz they got the gake on lock and I like that. I appreciate them, straight up :)."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of restaurants who provide incentives in exchange for 5 star reviews, but I did end up being a fan of this place. I came in on a Saturday night with a couple friends who are regulars here and my boo. We did the AYCE dinner which came out to around $24.99 a person, very reasonable pricing.   As for food we had quite a variety of things. My favorites were the Spoon Shooters, Screaming Orgasm, and the Garlic Hamachi. All three of these were delicious and I'd highly recommend trying them. As for the rolls we enjoyed a few different ones, but nothing really stood out as being spectacular. I can't say I tried anything I hated though so that's always a win.  The service was a little spotty though so I'm glad we sat at the sushi bar. There was a couple of times when I'd have to ask for a water refill or remind the waitress of the sake we ordered. Hopefully they can work on that a bit. Overall I enjoyed this place and would come back again."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot. My co workers and I love the all you can eat lunches. It's spotless and the fish is fresh. My absolute favorite roll is Who's Your Momma. It's quiet, service is quick, and I've never left disappointed. My kids love the chicken teriyaki bowls. They also do great take out - which is hard to find for sushi!"}
{"text":"Cute small place with a big menu and a lot of sushi rolls options! I tried the Mountin roll and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Sorry, yelp, but you are super wrong on this one.  I am pretty certain that the yelp score is inflated because they are offering people a free drink for a \"well written\" review.  Service was below average, nigiri was almost all rice, rolls were lacking in fish.  Some items like the uni and something special roll were good and worth going back for, but the things that I love like baked mussels and screaming orgasm salad were weak.  Probably won't go back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Sitting here now... been here for an hour and I've had 2 rolls. I'm with 3 other people and there's 5 other people in the restaurant. Service was extremely slow. It literally took a half hour to even get the edamame and California roll I ordered. Food was just mediocre. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Of course I found this place on Yelp nice little family ran joint. Excellent chefs nice lady who waited on us they were fast and friendly. The sashimi was excellent we had the screaming O and the poki salad along with salmon tuna and albacore sashimi every thug was fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Wanted some lunch after a doctor's appointment.  Wasn't hungry enough to do the all you can eat so I ordered the sashimi lunch included miso soup.  Nice quality fish.  Clean and quiet atmosphere.  Staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"We love this place! Very friendly staff and authentic delicious food. One of the best sushi spots in Las Vegas. Great atmosphere and good prices.  We will continue to get our sushi here for years to come."}
{"text":"In the middle of July, its astonishing that any business in Las Vegas would not have adequate air conditioning. Or at least have the temperature set on the cooler side of comfortable. I almost walked out as soon as I walked in because it was uncomfortably warm. I stuck it out and was wiping sweat from my forehead halfway into my meal. The sushi was ok, but not worth suffering through the heat."}
{"text":"Oh my sushi is awesome!!  If you haven't tried the johnny roll YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON LIFE.        We always do the all you can eat, it's the best value for us as we are hungry hungry hippos. Their service is attentive, their prices are good, and their sushi is delicious.       They are often our celebratory sushi date night location, and the place we drag all our friends to if they haven't had a johnny roll."}
{"text":"It was ok...got there and they just opened...the sever was great the food was ok...I'll try dinner next time might be better"}
{"text":"Walked in around 7:30 on a Friday and suprisingly there was only a couple of people in the place. We got a table right away. The food was good as well as the service. Large menu selection and only  $24.95 for dinner all-you-can-eat. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been searching for a new favorite sushi place for a while and found it! Great rolls, great service. It didn't take a long time for the food to come out. The server was very nice and punctual. Fun amber lighting. Great place! We did all you can eat, and it's not expensive!"}
{"text":"I live close by and enjoy the all-you-can-eat options. They are often very friendly and the sushi tastes fresh. A solid choice to satisfy the sushi craving."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese restaurant! Family owned, legit japanese chef behind the bar, small but clean space. I like that they kind of stay low-key, still they have a lot of patron who frequents the place. Hopeful that they will stay in the business for many more years!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi Restaurant in Las Vegas period! Ask for Khan master sushi chef he makes the best aloha rolls, clean cozy place to take your date."}
{"text":"I was craving for sushi, and didn't really want to drive to the other side of town for Sakana.   I didnt have to wait for seating. I had the AYCE. Ordered poke, saba, salmon, albacore, saba and uni sushi. This place is quite a disappointment. The proteins were thinly sliced, and so it is the typical huge chunk of rice to little protein ratio. I gotta say, their uni was fresh though.   Service was really slow, considering that there are only 3 parties in the restaurant.  I may or may not be back, but I don't really recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time coming here for lunch and it was amazing! It was $21.95 from 11am to 3pm. Everything was fresh, presented beautifully and quickly served! Some of my favorite dishes were the OMG roll, screaming orgasm, baby rock n roll, and the spoon shooter! Can't wait to come back here again and I can't believe it's in Summerlin!!! Support our local restaurants and keep them here!"}
{"text":"This is usually our go-to when we're craving sushi. My husband loves the all-you-can-eat menu selection. My favorites here are the shumai, beef teriyaki, and spicy tuna tempura roll. The service is great. It's hard to find an AYCE sushi restaurant with good service.  We have never had issues with the service. The price for the AYCE is pretty good.  The location is in a good area; close to our home. We've been to this restaurant before it was renamed to O My Sushi. It has improved much."}
{"text":"this is a very nice restaurant, quiet environment, polite and friendly servers. i feel very welcomed being here. we can sit very comfortable in this restaurant. there are a lot of choices in the menu, prices are reasonable. i highly recommend couples, families, even business lunch meeting to visit here."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down our favorite place- it's a weekly visit for us. If you can't find something on their menu that you enjoy- you shouldn't be eating sushi.  Everything is fresh tasting, portioned properly and done with absolute care and expertise. Calm relaxed setting and gotta love the whole in the wall type of hidden gem feeling."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage services offered. If you must go do not sit at the bar, they will ignore you; you must flag one of the sushi chef down to order. The server will refuse to take your order and insists you talk to the chefs. One of them was an old man who spoke barely any English and the other seemed to just work there this past month. My second time here and both times I walked out on them without having my fair share of AYCE."}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast, atmosphere was intimate and small but most importantly the food was outstanding. I definitely recommend ALADDIN AND KISS OF FIRE - both extremely refreshing and delicious. Service was quick and attentive. First time here and I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Wow, what a scam.  Jacked up Yelp ratings by offering freebies.  Took my wife there for her birthday because of the great ratings only to realize this place has the worst sushi we have experienced.  Yes, slow service, skimpy portions, and questionable quality.  No sashimi either, that should have been the tip off.  If you like rice, then order some rolls.  I've never heard a waitress say sorry so many times."}
{"text":"I went to oh my sushi about three days ago. If I could just give this place a review and no stars I would. I came here with my boyfriend because yelp said it was highly recommend. It was a big disappointment. When we first stepped inside the place only three costumers and we can and about an hour after they open. There sushi looked appetizing from how they describe it on there all you can eat menu. Sadly when the food arrived on the table and finally get to see what the buzz was all about I felt betrayed by yelp. There sushi was bland , dull, and my last order of sushi looked disgusting. It looked like someone had poured pepto bismol on my sushi. I noticed while at my table they have bribe yelp users to rate them well by giving them a free drink , beer, and a mug. Never going back I wouldn't even eat here if it was free. I suggest going to sakana or Yama sushi instead I promise you it a thousand times better then this place."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasted delicious, and they are all super nice. The Who's your Daddy roll is still making me sweat. In a land of a million all-you-can-eat hole-in-the-wall sushi counters, this one stands up."}
{"text":"Definitely not ever going back.  Sushi was not good at all, a lot of rice and little fish. Not the best quality.   Ordered also Katsu (pork) and it tasted pre frozen...it was dry and hard to chew.  There was only one server (during dinner on Friday night) which made everything worse. We couldn't order more than 4 items at a time which took about 30mins to get due to them only having 1 sushi chef.  Terrible place.  Save your money and take it somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The location of this place is great. I went in for take out during lunch. I ordered two rolls and both came out great. The salmon and tuna sushi was also amazing. The restaurant is small but very clean. The chef and the waitress were very friendly. I will definitely go back for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, I like that they have a teriyaki chicken roll, great option for people that don't love sushi. I have also had the crunchy roll and miso soup, both yummy."}
{"text":"This place needs help!!  25 mins for an appetizer that never came because we had to leave.. its 90* and no ac ..menu was way to  hard to figure out.. after 5 mins with waitress who  seemed just as confussed.. waited so long for our order that we wrote it down .."}
{"text":"Over priced combinations, decent sushi, I had to remind them for my spicy mayo & I found that to be an inconvincinece, not very detailed oriented.  Okay lunch spot... I recommend Osaka on sahara over this place.  Sunday 3:30 am walk In."}
{"text":"Cute little place. I think there was maybe only one server, and although she was wonderfully sweet, service was a little slow. Felt like it took forever to just get our waters. We were there around 12 on a Tuesday. The rolls were huge, too much rice though and the rice didn't taste fresh. In fact, the rice didn't have any flavor to it. Considering they open at 11, I would've assumed that the rice would've tasted much fresher. The rolls themselves didn't have much flavor to them at all. It wasn't awful, but I probably won't be back, there are too many sushi places out there to try instead. Also, on the table there was a sign saying to check out their Yelp reviews because they have a 5 star rating. They have a 4 star rating so maybe they should remove the sign."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi spot, prices are great, food is amazing and the staff are incredible. We try to make it in whenever we can. Order the sexy lady, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is actually decent. The service however, is extremely slow. Also, they have a disclaimer on their menu that your child no matter what age cannot share with you on AYCE. This means I have to buy my 1 1/2 year old her own meal? Most sushi places, children under 2 or 3 eat for free when you get the AYCE."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this \"under the radar\", local, casual sushi bar for many years. Probably 7 or more times per year, for about a decade. We enjoy the low key atmosphere, relaxed style, and of course the authentically prepared sushi by master craftsmen (and women). We always enjoy the food and experience, and am almost hesitant to recommend them, so they remain discreet, and not become mainstream. If so they may lose the relaxed atmosphere we most appreciate. That said, they are one of our favorite local sushi bars :)"}
{"text":"First time trying this place- the sushi is really good - comes out super fast and is good quality. There are so many options on the AYCE menu and it's only $22.95 for the dinner (all you can eat!). The inside is nice and clean. The lighting is relaxing. Definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat is very delicious here, with friendly staff and tasty sake. It's a convenient location in Summerlin"}
{"text":"Meh .... it's def cheapest all you can eat dinner sushi in town $22.99 pp . But it's a one hour limit and the service is so slow ( I came on Wednesday night , 1 chef , 1 waitress ) . I started ordering more than 2 items and she tells me the rule is ordering \" little by little \" ... There's only 1 chef and he can't make it that fast . The yellowtail hand-roll was 80% rice . The Nigiri was small and also heavy on rice . Also , I pulled up to the entrance and noticed there's only 1 other car , and inside there was 2 People . The light is all red , Gave me a headache . The waitress is not friendly , older lady and the chef seemed annoyed I ordered 2 rolls at the same time . Never again .... I'll go back to my favorite AYCE  : Sushi Koma"}
{"text":"Three stars for not being busy but the fish quality wasn't up to par. The rolls that I tried tasted the same since they pretty much use the same sauce for every roll. Unfortunately, I wouldn't go back especially since they charge half price for my five year old son who only ate miso soup and a little bit of tuna poke."}
{"text":"So I stopped in the o my and was left disappointed in this visit, the rice portion is just abnormally large for all you can eat. It's truly rice overload. Egh"}
{"text":"service at this place was horrible. I've tried many places for ayce sushi and by far the service at this one was garbage. not even the sushi made up for the horrible service. sushi wise it wasn't the greatest. probably a 2 out of 5 star in regards to the quality of the sushi. wouldn't go back to this place again. sorry"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here about a year ago, he's been coming here for 3 years, since before they changed their name from Tokyoto to O My. This place is honestly one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to, overall. The staff is so incredible friendly and they always take the absolute best care of us! The food is high quality and delicious and I enjoy trying new rolls because everything tastes so good. My favorite roll, however, has to be the Nevada Queen. This will always be one of our spots and I encourage anyone who loves sushi to give this place a chance! You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Came here on a little sushi date with my sister. Service was excellent and the food was good. It is very quiet and cozy. I recommend the green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"Our all time favorite sushi spot!! This place is not only convenient, but also delicious. The service is great and we never wait long for rolls to come out. This is a regular go to restaurant of ours :) Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Since we had time before our flight departure, we thought we would fit in a sushi dinner instead of the usual airport offerings. We are always on the lookout for quality neighborhood restaurants.   We were incredibly disappointed by this place! We mistook the name change to be a new restaurant, but the quality was so poor. Such a sad representation of sushi. The sizing of the fish was so small, but since the quality seemed poor, I'm not sure I would have wanted to eat a generous piece.   Needless to say, we left for our flight worrying if we would get food poisoning. Luckily nothing happened, but that's not a concern I ever want to have with a restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid sushi joint, the AYCE is worth it if you plan on eating more than 2 rolls. $19.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner! I sat at the sushi bar, the chef was friendly and hospitable as was the waitress. Little Korean lady, very nice. Will return!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here for lunch! Their poke and katsu are so delicious and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Very welcoming, with a modern Japanese feel! Came to sushi with my friend & had such an amazing experience. Good prices for the lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"sushi was pretty good & our sever was on the ball considering she was the only one working. My food took very long, I waited 25 minutes for my first roll. There were only 2 other tables, 3 sushi chefs, and I was sitting right at the bar. Every roll after that just took a long time. Was here 2 hours for the 3 rolls I ordered and the 3-4 rolls my husband ordered. Not very memorable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week and was quite disappointed in the experience. Myself and 1 guest did ayce. The waitress seemed annoyed like 'how dare these people try our special priced menu' but I ignored it and we ordered. The service was slow, and of the few questions we had regarding the food, the people were in too much of a hurry to explain much. Overall the food was what you would expect from an ayce place, I've had better and much worse, it was the service that guarantees I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered a California roll, kiss of fire, ikura, inari. The sushi was fresh, very good taste. Service was OK. I mean the one woman waiting on tables was all alone. But she was moving quickly. For what I've mentioned so far they deserve 5 stars. However, the ventilation is horrible. I now wreak of old thick oil. My kids needed to be taken outside twice due to the heavy oil smell. It felt like we were covered in grease, and breathing grease. That was horrible!! Thick heavy greasy air!! I need a shower and fresh air STAT!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place has new owners. Went here around 5 pm for AYCE $24.95 for dinner (starts at 3 pm-close). This place has turned into a little secret gem in Summerlin.  We were seated right away at a table (by choice). The service was outstanding. Waitress took our drink order as soon as we were seated. Kirin Light Large $6.00. The menu is huge and the waitress was back right away to take our order.   We ordered a \"ton\" of stuff, so I am not going to embarrass myself by listing it. Everything was so fresh and what I loved was that they were light on the rice. Most AYCE give you so much rice. The only complaint I have (not sure if it's legitimate) is that I ordered the screaming organism and I am used to the one at Sushi Fever so I was shocked when it arrived and was only 4 small pieces. I hope it's not that small if someone ordered it that was not doing AYCE. But I will say it was excellent.   I will def. be returning t this place. They were so nice and the fish was cold and so fresh. If you are looking for a new AYCE check this place out. They have been open a month."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast and friendly staff, I swing by for lunch every once and a while when I'm at work and I get the same consistent service every time. Definitely would recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once before, so when my family was in the mood for Sushi today, this place was came to mind. I arrived before my husband and kids so the waitress came to take our drink orders. I order water for myself, Dr. Pepper for my honey and 2 lemonades for my kiddos. The lemonades came in nice plastics cups with lids. The only problem I had with this, is that my 7 y/old's lid had a fruit fly stuck underneath and there was a lliiitttlllee teeny black spec of something floating around. Now normally when there is something that was probably JUST alive resting in peace under your child's drink lid, that's a huge red flag. BUT we were SUPER cool about it. We alerted the waitress, who said nothing as she took his drink away.  Shortly after she comes back out with, what we assume is a new cup of lemonade. By this time we are starving and ready to place our order. I pick up his cup, a low and behold. THE SAMMMMEEE FLIPPIN FRUIT FLY IS STILLL CHILLLIN UNDER HIS LID!!  She got rid of the littttlee teeny spec but not the actual insect?????  At this point we walked out of the restaurant.  This place could have the BEST sushi in the world but careless service and complete disregard for cleanliness is unacceptable.. Makes me wonder how many bugs are actually in the FOOD!!"}
{"text":"I rate 2 stars for service. The food service is taking FOREVER!! We went here around 4:30pm and there was only server, and every order it'll take 20mins before it gets to our table. Not perfect to come here if you're hungry, you're just gonna lose your appetite for waiting for your food. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Ever since my sister showed me this place a couple years, it's the only place I go for sushi now. They're fast and effective. The sushi is unique, but my favorite thing to order is the cucumber salad, Nevada queen and popcorn shrimp!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome they have provided a wonderful experience for us. Great service. Sushi is spectacular and the beer is awesome."}
{"text":"Did AYCE for dinner. Arrived around 7pm and they were very busy. Service is slow. It took 10 minutes just to get a water. Items ordered tasted good but came out in a random order from how we ordered them. Got the wagon master roll because it sounded good, was WAY too spicy! I would return but not eat so much!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. It is run by a family. The man is the sushiman and prepares everything in front of you. His wife serves the table. Everything is super tasty and the price is fair. We got the all you can eat option and don't regret at all! Try the Kiss of Fire Roll, the Screaming Orgasm and the baked options. Saporo beer only U$3,50! The AYCE has dessert also (mochi and ice cream). We live in Chicago and everytime we come to Vegas we stop by this place even being so far from the touristic part of the city where we always stay."}
{"text":"Very veryyyy good!!! Great service!! Fresh food and very tasty !! The poke amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant based on the 4 out of 5 star rating, and I came in hopeful and ready to eat their all you can eat sushi based on all of the amazing looking rolls based on the pictures taken by other customer reviews and the plentiful sushi menu. But when our party of 8 came into the restaurant, we were hardly greeted by our waitress and did not feel very welcome. Our waitress often walked away while we were trying to order and our food came out very slowly, which left the others and I anxiously waiting for our food to be delivered. The fact that our food came out so slowly made us question whether or not we were going to be able to order everything and be satisfied within the 1 hour window of allotted to you when you order all you can eat sushi.   The food is good and the sushi selection is great, but the service was very disappointing and underwhelming. The restaurant was not busy at the time as there was only two other tables occupied at the time. I definitely wouldn't want to come back. My expectations of customer service and eating experience was not met unfortunately."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, never had a problem. They have a great menu and a variety to choose from, with curious sushi roll names like \"Snow white\" or \"who's your daddy\". I especially love one roll that they call \"Johnny\" roll, which you can only order once if you opt to get their \"all you can eat\" menu, but so worth it, as it's an absolute treat. This place is good for the whole family, date night, boys or girls night out. It's small and intimate, so you're not competing to talk over other people, and the staff there is very welcoming, greeting you in Japanese with a warm smile. Plus love the J-Pop music they play there."}
{"text":"Service was nice. The time they give for dinner and lunch is the same 1 hr. Not alot of time considering that they were slow on bringing the items out.  The uni was good and the unagi was great but for the other fish pretty plain.  The salmon kama was good and recommend that. We also got the salmon skin hand roll would pass on that.  If your in the area I would recommend going to hanabi down the road.  Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. Donna is a great server with a bubbly personality. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, excellent food. First time here, I'm definitely coming back  best in Vegas so far. It has a great atmosphere! If you are in the boca area and you are looking for a great place for lunch or dinner definitely come check it out! You guys won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Reasonably priced. I would come back here again. Excellent service and sushi was fast."}
{"text":"Found a dime in the AYCE venue of sushi work in Vegas. They're popping up everywhere but normally AYCE is subjected to lackluster pieces of sushi. This place serves good portions and awesome creations as well as some staples. Only reason not a five star rating is speed and accuracy. Few of our orders didn't go thru but not a big deal. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place. My husband and I have been going here as long as we have been dating and continued  once we got married. I've gone to 1 other sushi place and it felt like we cheated on them. We have taken multiple friends here and all have give thumbs up. Even my sister loves it here."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Horrible service, non refillable drinks, unagi sauce is like stale gravy. I am a sushi addict and I can honestly say this is not the place for you to get quality AYCE. Waste of $27, the fact that it was $27 for below par sushi HA"}
{"text":"I worked nearby, so I come here for lunch once or twice a week. Amazing poke bowl for a reasonable price. Their lunch special is also a great deal. Two rolls for 9 dollars. I usually get the tuna rolls and the fish is fresh. They also have all you can eat for both lunch and dinner, which I will come back and try it next time."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Sushi was not good. Everything was covered is sweet eel sauce or mayo, I guess I am more into pure fish in its fresh form. Screaming orgasm was a joke. Couldn't get out fast enough."}
{"text":"With all the sushi places in town, you have to have some sort special characteristic that makes you stand out from the rest. This place sadly didn't. The food was good, but I've had way better. Service was good. The restaurant itself is small and well kept. Prices are doable."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant ever!! Lyndsey was our waitress and her hospitality was superb! The food was fabulous and the ambiance was incredible ! I give this place 5 stars and thumbs up!"}
{"text":"AUCE lunch for $21.95? YES PLEASE!! Very good presentation, fish was high quality and very good. The Sexy Lady roll was AMAZING!! And the super white tuna was the bomb! Would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting a great AUCE option. THANKS O MY SUSHI for a great time!"}
