{"text":"Good spot for sushi, had the all you can eat dinner. 
Overall solid selection of food, sushi was tasty I recommend the green dragon. Skewers and tempura also good. 

Service was fast, Very clean place and the atmosphere was more loungey and modern. Will be coming back !"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE BLACK PLAGUE. I've eaten at plenty of Sushi places but my god, none of them were so bad that warranted me to make a Yelp account and warn people not to go there at any cost even if it was free. I really don't even know where to start.

Food Quality
The chicken Teriyaki and Skewers tasted absolutely disgusting, as soon as I took one bite of each I began to vomit, I couldn't tell if the meat was expired or severely undercooked. The meat on their Beef Ribs were cut to smaller pieces like they were shrapnels and when we ordered 30 pieces they only brought out 20. The Beef Mushroom roll wasn't separated properly and in drenched in this disgusting sauce that tasted like duck vomit. The Green and red dragon rolls that we ordered were tasteless and incredibly warm, as if their avocado and salmon sashimi weren't properly refrigerated to the right temperature. 

Service
From the moment I entered, everything in my body told me run like hell. But I was feeling adventurous and my friend already arrived there 5 min before I did (3:05) and made the first order, so I though I gave it a shot. The servers were unnecessarily rude from the get go and wouldn't take away the empty plates unless we asked them to and every time we asked for something, like an extra napkin or fork/knife we had to explain what the item was for 3 minutes cause there was huge gaps in our language barriers because they couldn't speak any english. Their last call was at 3:30, so at 3:22 we asked to see the menu (paper & pencil) again to make one last order. We made the order at exactly 3:26 and as we  continued to finish the food that was already on the table. We later asked what happened to our food, the Server informed us that the food was ordered after 3:30, in which we asked her if this was the case how come she failed to inform us at the time the order was made or why she would even give us the menu to begin with. Furthermore how was it that the table beside us which coincidentally happen to hand in their order AT THE SAME TIME as we did, received their food order but ours was declined, they simply replied in a language thats known as bullshit. As if that wasn't bad enough the whole time they were staring us down in order so that we would be intimidated into leaving as if we were robbing the place, in all honesty we weren't even there for more then 30 min and only ordered twice. If it was up to me I wouldn't have tipped a cent but I guess when 10% tip is included in the bill they can just ignore any type of customer service or have any type of human decency or business professionalism. My friend told me one thing in which I'm inclined to believe his right, any AYCE place on Yonge is garbage.

Save yourself the trouble and drive 5 minutes away to Akimi which is between Bayview and Leslie on elgin mills, their food turnover might be slow but it is worth the wait cause their food quality is excellent 7.5/10 and their customer service is top notch 8/10, it is truly one of the best places I've been to within Richmond Hill.

{"text":"Do not know how this place got such good reviews.  Waitress or the owner of the place was cutting her nails in the back.  Secondly, food was alright, edible, but probably one of the worst if not the worst sushi places I have ever been to.  More customers came and waitress was still cutting her nails, I would really have forgiven her had she had stopped but seriously........how many people have to come into the restaurant before you stop.

Only one waitress for the whole night from 6-9PM so service was pretty much down the drain along with our appetites.  Only thing that really saved it was the fact that it was probably cheaper than a lot of other Japanese AYCE as the bill for two people after tax was under 55 dollars without tip.

Many other great Japanese AYCE to go to but do not DO NOT go to this one warning you now =)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a weekday after looking for a sushi place and seeing 998 Naruto. The restaurant is moderate sized and was about full a while after I came. The ambiance was beautiful and there was a big counter at the front where the chefs were preparing the food.

We ordered quite a lot of sashimi and it was good for the price. It did take a long time to arrive though (and I'm pretty sure it was their strategy). The edamame and sweet potato tempura weren't soft like you would expect. And the other tempura were lacking in flavors alone but absorbed a soy sauce flavor when dipped. I usually enjoy tempura without sauce and was pretty disappointed.

Tip : don't get any meat skewers; they were flavourless and tough. Don't get anything with chicken; it tasted like it was old.

Dishes I recommend are: deep fried scallops, salmon teriyaki, and grilled mussels.

The highlight of the dinner was their ... interesting dessert menu.

Overall, I will recommend this place and for sure will come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to love Naruto's. It was our favourite sushi place in Richmond Hill. When it changed owners, the quality in food and service has really declined. I went in for AYCE lunch yesterday with a friend and I couldn't figure out why I was still hungry even though we had ordered a lot of food. Well it turns out that half the items didn't even make it to the table! How do I know this? I ordered salmon teriyaki on two separate order forms and it never came at all (among other things). I thought it was a mistake so I asked for a third order form and the waitress basically scoffed at me. What did she expect? I was starving because we weren't getting all our food! Just to test it, I made sure to count the number of items that I ordered and I was right about my suspicion that they were holding food back. When the waitress brought my sushi order, she also had the nerve to tell me that I had to eat the rice that came with my sushi. Well I didn't feel like it so I only ate the fish. I have never been told how to eat at an AYCE sushi restaurant before. I found her demeanour appalling. I will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very low quality. I ordered veggie combo - rolls had no veggies in them - all rice. Salad was a few slices of lettuce with dressing. Miso soup tasted like dishwater.  My hubby had bento box said it was good but I will never return."}
{"text":"I don't usually write a lot of reviews but this time I felt COMPELLED to write one. My husband and I were here yesterday and the food was not horrible. Everything was ok until they missed our order of sashimi. No big deal, I let the waitress know and she was like \"ok\". Then, I heard the chefs behind the sushi bar/counter whispering and looking at us. I was a little creeped out so I kept my eye on them. Here comes the horrible part....

I heard someone spitting. My husband heard it too. Not a little spit but a giant mucous spit (he literally sounded like he was going to gag). I looked up and saw the CHEF BEHING THE SUSHI BAR SPIT on the floor while they prepared our sashimi. I had no words. That was the nastiest thing I have ever seen. What kind of chef spits where he prepares food and IN FRONT of customers? We were sitting right in front of the sushi bar/counter.
I told my husband, he was grossed out. We will never be back again.

oh and by the way, my husband felt sick 3 hours after eating there. 

AVOID PLEASE :("}
{"text":"I cannot eat that much rice. Small thin fish on the nagari, thumb sized load of rice. couldnt taste the fish and rolls fell apart. servers 2 did a good job. will not be returning. excavated salmon roll to find fish only stuck in on the ends to make it look good.

rainbow roll was good though..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very low quality.

You'll first notice that it is a buffet, that in and of itself doesn't always mean low quality. I've eaten at some high quality Japanese buffets in Scarborough. Be warned, this is not one of them.

Upon entering the restaurant, you'll notice two things:

1. It's empty 
2. Nowhere does it give you the price

It wasn't until I got the bill, did I notice that this restaurant was quite reasonable at $13.95. However, I still won't eat here again.

You are immediately seated but there seems to be some confusion between them two servers as who will seat you. As I mentioned the restaurant was empty yet somehow I ended up sitting next to the only other people in the restaurant. When they left, the next people sat in their spot...so right away, no privacy.

When a patron pulls out his laptop, one would assume that they would be using the free wifi....it was available but you couldn't get on the internet with it. Nobody came to help, thankfully, I wasn't in need of Internet but when you advertise free wifi, it is nice if it is working.

The waitress was not happy when she greeted me and I felt that she was pushy and not polite.

My menu had no prices, just a warning that if you don't eat everything, you'll be charged $1 per dish not eaten. I also noticed that my menu was dirty and had soya sauce on it, not good.

I ordered a variety of things, an assortment of sushi, udon soup, tempura, a wing, dumplings, etc.

Although, I ordered a variety of sushi, I got the SAME sushi, only dressed differently. One was plain, two had sauces on them and another had sesame seeds on them but underneath it was the SAME. WTF?!?

For most of what I ordered, ie the dumpling, wing, etc...one order meant a total of one wing, one dumpling, one sad shrimp tempura, etc...

However, for the specialty sushi, standard order is 6!!!! So, I believe that I had 24 pieces of sushi that needed to be eaten. It was subpar, the fish didn't taste fresh and the sushi wasn't wrapped properly and was falling apart. I never got my salmon sushi, eel sushi, etc...this was very deceptive and stupid. Like I would not notice?

The udon was undercooked...the udon was hard and difficult to eat, I ate it anyway because it was better than eating the sushi.

In the end, it was so disappointing that I didn't bother to say anything. She asked me whether I wanted to take out my leftovers and I declined because it was that bad.

The waitress ended up charging me an arbitrary $4 extra for my uneaten sushi, it is $4 that I am happy to pay because I will never come here again. 

So, no prices listed, low quality food, chefs can't cook/reheat, service with attitude, you get the same thing over again, and they miss parts of your meal, you are charged arbitrary amounts of money for uneaten food...wifi not working, no privacy. Why bother! Save yourself the trouble and eat at McDonald's, at least there, the smiles are free."}
{"text":"By far the worst Japanese AYCE place I've been to.  When I got there on a Thurs night, the place was almost totally empty with maybe like two tables of customer which is a bad sign since it means a slow turnover of food.  Selection was really limited for AYCE.  Sushi and sashimi were of very poor quality (Even for AYCE level).  Seaweed were sticky and not fresh from all the sashimi.  Spider roll had no 'soft shell crab or so little that you can't taste it.  Philadephia roll had like the smallest of sliver of smoked salmon.  Cooked items were horrible as well.  My wife could not even eat the beef udon she orderd.  The chicken and beef skewers were grossly overcooked.  I couldn't say there was one item that I ordered in which I enjoyed.  A place that can mess up chicken terriyaki really sums up what this place is all about.  Even with a $10 off coupon from a flyer, this place does not product value nor quantity.  Despite a slow night, the staff was not very attentive.  They weren't horrible, but were not very friendly.  I would truly avoid this place."}
{"text":"February 2016 - TOTALLY NOT RECOMMENDED!  I had to create a new Yelp account so I can warn others!  

The beef was so hard to chew. I couldn't eat a piece of it.  The worst beef I have tasted in a restaurant. Complained to the server and nothing was done. We were also charged for the hot tea which wasn't explained to us. 

I suggest you go else where."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5... i found it good.. the chicken was gross lol. It tasted like it was boiled. :/.... the salmon was CRUNCCHY.... my bf and I go to sushi like a new place once a week ( we've been dating for almost 2 years that's a lot of places LOL) anyways. It wasn't bad. I enjoyed the sushi. A lot. Even tho it kept falling apart. They were sooo cheap with the short ribs. We ordered 10+10 and they gave us total of 12/13/.. and half was fat:(. I know it's lunch but still I'm paying $14.99 I want to eat. Another thing the atomosphere was nice it was like purple lights. The waitresses were breathing down our shoulder and watching us the whole time. Made us uncomfortable. We would talk and she would laugh at our jokes. Kindaaaa weird lol. I didn't check the bathrooms. I would def go again because overall I liked it. Just those things. Also my bf said his salmon sushi had a smell:( so he didn't eat it."}
{"text":"They claimed that their credit card machine was not connecting. Two days in a row. When told we didn't have Canadian dollars, they offered to take US dollars on the 1:1 course. Scammers."}
{"text":"Terrible cheap sushi. 
The tempura was completely stale and tasted like it was days old. 
Rice on the sushi tasted so off I got a stomach ache after. 
You can tel the quality is lacking and the ingredients are cheap. Would not return 
Service is mediocre. But waste of money there's dozens of places I would go to in the GTA before naruto"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls had too much rice--like, a ridiculous amount. I get that it's AYCE so it's reasonable to expect more rice in their rolls than usual, but the Boston Roll had so much rice, I had to deconstruct it to find the fish. After requesting less rice, they filled my rolls with tempura flakes instead. The sashimi didn't taste right, and although my son was fine after eating his meal, I was a bit ill."}
{"text":"Not at all close to my expectation. I had experience with other All U Can eat Sushi restaurants, so I went there to give them a shot. Although the staff was friendly, however the Sushies were not even close to any standard. Very big sushies, rice were not well cooked, sauces were not good. No visual menu, and the prices were to expensive.,"}
{"text":"Chicken was gross and shorts ribs were just a plate of bones in grease fish was old and waitress stood behind us always staring at us"}
{"text":"Good food. Waiter screams in your face and acts like she doesn't want customers at her business"}
